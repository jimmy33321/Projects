11.4: 1 2 3 5 4 6

11.6: 1 2 4 6 3 5

11.9: In the worst case scenario, no vertex is visited multiple times, the
worst case scenario requires every vertex to be checked once, and since
visitors are marked and not visited again, it is still efficient. 

11.10:
Shortest path from vertex 4 to:
vertex 1: 12 (path being 4-6-1)
vertex 2: 5  (path being 4-2)
vertex 3: 8  (path being 4-2-3)
vertex 4: 0  (path being 4-4)
vertex 5: 11 (path being 4-5)
vertex 6: 10 (path being 4-6)
