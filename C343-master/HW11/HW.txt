	Dijkstra's algorithm would be a good candidate for this problem, but requires some modification. Since Dijkstra's algorithm finds the 
	shortest path from one fixed node to all other nodes, and the problem
	is asking for us the shortest path from every node to a specific node. 
	So if we sort of "reverse" the algorithm, and the destination in our problem would be the origin/starting node in Dijkstra's algorithm.

	Dijkstra's algorithm works by starting at one vertex and 
	getting the shortest path form that to every other vertex. 
	So this would be a spanning tree, as as all vertices would 
	be present, and there would not be any cycles. 
        It may not be a MST as Dijkstra's algorithm is designed to find
        the minimum cost between two vertices, while Prim's algorithm
	is designed to find the minimum total cost of a path 
        containing every vertex. 

Abstract
	Graph theory is helpful to provide an understanding to the brain's network. However, the conventional methods of analysis for Graph theory
	do not transfer for the analysis of brain networks. To combat this, a minimal spanning tree (MST) is constructed and then compared
        more easily to other graphs/networks. By studying the MST of people with epilepsy, scientists have discovered critical nodes associated with
        Seizures. In this MS study, the MST was created by applying Kruskal's algorithm. These MSTs were compared between patients and a healthy
        control group, and the dissimilarity was measured. The study found there were some large dissimilarities between the healthy and the ill.
        This study demonstrated that the MST contains the most important nodes in a Brain network.
