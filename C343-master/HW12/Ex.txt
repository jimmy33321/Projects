2. The suffix tree of "databigdata" was drawn by hand and uploaded as a picture, The only picture include here
	The path of the query (I'll describe it in words) would be to 
	look at paths that start with 'd'. That gives us 2 children to look at
	the internal node that represents "data" with a left child of
	"$." This leaf would show a successful path. Another option
	in the tree is to use the leaf node (a child of the root) that is
	"data$". Both of these paths find the query in text.

3. See Java files
