The complexity of the Flood function, not including other methods used but not created, will be the time complexity of searching a LinkedList, combined with inserting into a LinkedList.
The complexity of searching is in big theta of N, while the complexity of inserting into a LinkedList is in Big Theta of 1, so the total time complexity some constant times n.
