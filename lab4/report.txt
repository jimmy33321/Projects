lab 4
I worked with jeremiah trotter <jctrotte>

We managed to get the lab workin.

The difficulty was in getting the program to read the user input. We fixed this
issue by putting the button input reader inside of a while loop, so that it
would be read each time.

I learned about how to interface with the board. I leanred exactly which key
phrases did what and how to work with them.
