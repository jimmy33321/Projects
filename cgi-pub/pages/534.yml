   Gremlins Inc. brings corruption, bribery and mischief to the virtual tabletop
- |2+

    If you ask me, Gremlins Inc. is treating early access the way most games should. It already is in a fully playable and properly polished state that simply is not 100% feature complete and solely needs your pre-release support in order to achieve its, hopefully glorious, complete form. But, what is Gremnlins Inc anyway, I pretend to hear you ask. Well, it's a beautiful and devilishly entertaining indie board game, that somehow managed to find itself on Steam's digital tabletop instead of, well, our collective and very physical tables.

   Sylvio 2 Looking to Bring Creepy Video to its Haunting Repertoire

  Sylvio was an eerie, chilling experience, frightening its players with an uncomfortable atmosphere as they sought to collect the spoken words of the dead through electronic voice phenomena. Hearing those phantoms was both sad and unsettling, but now, developer Stroboskop is looking to add some frightening visuals to the mix, giving protagonist Juliette Waters a video recorder for the game's sequel, Sylvio 2. Judging from these first looks (and the demo, which you can get right now), the ghosts are much, much creepier than the ones in the previous game, adding some more visual punch to go along with the previous game's excellent audio. Everything that held back the first game is being beefed up or stripped away entirely, leaving behind what's shaping up to be a powerful horror experience.

  Quietly, Matthew Brown Games have produced an exceptional library of minimalist puzzle games of outstanding quality. The three Hexcells games took mechanical inspirations from other puzzles like Minesweeper and Picross, expanding on them with stellar design and clever interactions to create phenomenal games. The newest title in the pseudo-series, Squarecells, recently released on Steam and continues this trend.

  There are times when games truly earn the title of classic. Franchises that have been around seemingly forever, or individual games that are still played and loved today, held together by strong, devoted communities. One such true classic, and one of the original games inspired by Rogue, Nethack has recently received an new official update after over a decade.

   Indie Devs Team Up to Support Singaporean Game Convention

  What better way is there to promote a game convention than by creating a game for it? Seow Zong Hui, developer of the awesome Street Fighter X Mega Man, joined up with producer Eliphant to create a free action platformer to showcase developers from Singapore's GameStart gaming convention. Witching Hour Studios (Masquerada: Songs and Shadows), Daylight Studios (Holy Potatoes! A Weapon Shop?!), and several other indies all make appearances with their own characters, each altering the gameplay in their own way.  Although the convention is over, you can still download and play the platformer, seeing many of the developers' first forays into sidescrolling action. So, grab it, start blasting enemies, try to pinpoint all the cameos, and maybe get yourself a little excited for what GameStart is going to have to show in 2016.

   The Unique and Solitary Story of Pinstripe

    Pinstripe is absolutely gorgeous. It's also intricate, intriguing, impressive and created by a single individual, which not only makes it all the more impressive, but also a testament to what a talented and determined artist can achieve when working for four years: one of the most promising indie arcade adventures ever. And from what I've seen in the preview build I spent a couple hours with, Pinstripe already delivers on each and every imaginary promise it ever made.

   Virtual Grappi - Happy Times in Happy Places with Happy Friends

  How hard can it be to keep a blob happy? I mean, Blobert was largely happy all through my playthrough of A Boy and his Blob, even as he watched me fall to my demise a few hundred times. So I figured I knew what was up when it came to taking care of my new gelatinous pal in Virtual Grappi. Still, how do you make a blob happy? Will a tire make him happy? Will a hat? What about a stun gun? Things just kind of happen when you give Grappi things, like turning its house into a beehive or making an alarming creature come to the window. Keeping the poor creature alive and happy with this hodgepodge of items isn't always easy, but it'll help create a friendship you'll treasure forever.

  Unless, you know, you accidentally send Grappi to a hellish nightmare world from which there's no escape. But how likely is that to happen?

   A Gift of Challenge - Retooling Odallus: The Dark Call for its New Veteran Mode

- "Higher difficulties are a common lure to pull a player back into your game. Still,
  how do you make your game harder in a way that's interesting? Make the player less
  durable and give the enemies more health? Is that all there is to it? Danilo Dias,
  main programmer at JoyMasher, didn't think so as he created Odallus: The Dark Call's
  new Veteran Mode. He wanted \"A new challenge - familiar, but at the same time,
  different. A harder challenge for someone that already knows how the game works
  and wants more.\" \n"

   The Making Of Lumino City

    Lumino City, the wonderfully handcrafted and quite frankly stunning puzzle adventure for Windows, Mac and iOS, has finally gotten its making of. Only it's not a write-up on sister site Gamasutra this time, but a clever and lovingly crafted freeware iOS app (iPad, iPhone) offering a highly intriguing behind the scenes look at the creation of the game. You'll see how Lumino City went from concept to paper models to a finished game, how its puzzles were designed and even how State of Play spent three years working on this lovely adventure. Oh, and you'll also get to play around with lights and cameras too.

They believe that audio should be considered a critical part of game design from the very beginning, rather than something to be tacked on later. It's a subject that Kho is passionate about. "It is important that what we do is not just about providing high quality audio for games, but also about protecting the interests of the industry," she says. "Through forging friendships with the games development community, we find ourselves constantly pushing for meaningful collaboration instead of unnecessary competition."

  Monday, Dec 14, 2015IndieGames.com is presented by the UBM TechWeb Game Network, which runs the Independent Games Festival & Summit every year at Game Developers Conference. The company (producer of the Game Developers Conference series, Gamasutra.com and Game Developer magazine) established the Independent Games Festival in 1998 to encourage innovation in game development and to recognize the best independent game developers.Read MoreDecember 14, 2015 11:00 AM | Konstantinos Dimopoulos / GnomeIf you ask me, Gremlins Inc. is treating early access the way most games should. It already is in a fully playable and properly polished state that simply is not 100% feature complete and solely needs your pre-release support in order to achieve its, hopefully glorious, complete form. But, what is Gremnlins Inc anyway, I pretend to hear you ask. Well, it's a beautiful and devilishly entertaining indie board game, that somehow managed to find itself on Steam's digital tabletop instead of, well, our collective and very physical tables.Tags: board game, early access, gremlins inc, linux, mac, steam, strategy, windows

  December 10, 2015 12:00 PM | Joel CoutureSylvio was an eerie, chilling experience, frightening its players with an uncomfortable atmosphere as they sought to collect the spoken words of the dead through electronic voice phenomena. Hearing those phantoms was both sad and unsettling, but now, developer Stroboskop is looking to add some frightening visuals to the mix, giving protagonist Juliette Waters a video recorder for the game's sequel, Sylvio 2. Judging from these first looks (and the demo, which you can get right now), the ghosts are much, much creepier than the ones in the previous game, adding some more visual punch to go along with the previous game's excellent audio. Everything that held back the first game is being beefed up or stripped away entirely, leaving behind what's shaping up to be a powerful horror experience.Tags: horror, kickstarter, niklas swanberg, stroboskop, sylvio 2

  Quietly, Matthew Brown Games have produced an exceptional library of minimalist puzzle games of outstanding quality. The three Hexcells games took mechanical inspirations from other puzzles like Minesweeper and Picross, expanding on them with stellar design and clever interactions to create phenomenal games. The newest title in the pseudo-series, Squarecells, recently released on Steam and continues this trend.Tags: Linux, mac osx, Matthew Brown, puzzle, review, squarecells, Steam, Windows

  There are times when games truly earn the title of classic. Franchises that have been around seemingly forever, or individual games that are still played and loved today, held together by strong, devoted communities. One such true classic, and one of the original games inspired by Rogue, Nethack has recently received an new official update after over a decade.Tags: NetHack, news, roguelike, update

  December  8, 2015 11:30 AM | Joel CoutureWhat better way is there to promote a game convention than by creating a game for it? Seow Zong Hui, developer of the awesome Street Fighter X Mega Man, joined up with producer Eliphant to create a free action platformer to showcase developers from Singapore's GameStart gaming convention. Witching Hour Studios (Masquerada: Songs and Shadows), Daylight Studios (Holy Potatoes! A Weapon Shop?!), and several other indies all make appearances with their own characters, each altering the gameplay in their own way.  Although the convention is over, you can still download and play the platformer, seeing many of the developers' first forays into sidescrolling action. So, grab it, start blasting enemies, try to pinpoint all the cameos, and maybe get yourself a little excited for what GameStart is going to have to show in 2016.Tags: android, daylight studios, eliphant, free, gamestart 2015, ios, platformer, seow zong hui, witching hour studios

  December  8, 2015  7:45 AM | Konstantinos Dimopoulos / GnomePinstripe is absolutely gorgeous. It's also intricate, intriguing, impressive and created by a single individual, which not only makes it all the more impressive, but also a testament to what a talented and determined artist can achieve when working for four years: one of the most promising indie arcade adventures ever. And from what I've seen in the preview build I spent a couple hours with, Pinstripe already delivers on each and every imaginary promise it ever made.But, seriously, why listen to me, when creator Thomas Brush is here to further enlighten you? No reason really...Tags: action-adventure, atmos games, interview, pinstripe, preorder, Thomas Brush

  December  8, 2015  6:00 AM | Joel CoutureHow hard can it be to keep a blob happy? I mean, Blobert was largely happy all through my playthrough of A Boy and his Blob, even as he watched me fall to my demise a few hundred times. So I figured I knew what was up when it came to taking care of my new gelatinous pal in Virtual Grappi. Still, how do you make a blob happy? Will a tire make him happy? Will a hat? What about a stun gun? Things just kind of happen when you give Grappi things, like turning its house into a beehive or making an alarming creature come to the window. Keeping the poor creature alive and happy with this hodgepodge of items isn't always easy, but it'll help create a friendship you'll treasure forever.Unless, you know, you accidentally send Grappi to a hellish nightmare world from which there's no escape. But how likely is that to happen?Tags: free, friendship, humor, simulation, sooz, virtual grappi

  December  7, 2015  8:30 AM | Joel CoutureHigher difficulties are a common lure to pull a player back into your game. Still, how do you make your game harder in a way that's interesting? Make the player less durable and give the enemies more health? Is that all there is to it? Danilo Dias, main programmer at JoyMasher, didn't think so as he created Odallus: The Dark Call's new Veteran Mode. He wanted "A new challenge - familiar, but at the same time, different. A harder challenge for someone that already knows how the game works and wants more." Tags: action, danilo dias, interview, joymasher, odallus, odallus: the dark call, thais weiller

  Gremlins Inc. brings corruption, bribery and mischief to the virtual tabletop\n\nDecember
  14, 2015 11:00 AM | Konstantinos Dimopoulos / Gnome\n\n  If you ask me, Gremlins
  Inc. is treating early access the way most games should. It already is in a fully
  playable and properly polished state that simply is not 100% feature complete and
  solely needs your pre-release support in order to achieve its, hopefully glorious,
  complete form. But, what is Gremnlins Inc anyway, I pretend to hear you ask. Well,
  it's a beautiful and devilishly entertaining indie board game, that somehow managed
  to find itself on Steam's digital tabletop instead of, well, our collective and
  very physical tables.\n\n        \n        Continue reading...\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:

  Sylvio 2 Looking to Bring Creepy Video to its Haunting Repertoire\n\nDecember 10,
  2015 12:00 PM | Joel Couture\n\n  \n\nSylvio was an eerie, chilling experience,
  frightening its players with an uncomfortable atmosphere as they sought to collect
  the spoken words of the dead through electronic voice phenomena. Hearing those phantoms
  was both sad and unsettling, but now, developer Stroboskop is looking to add some
  frightening visuals to the mix, giving protagonist Juliette Waters a video recorder
  for the game's sequel, Sylvio 2. Judging from these first looks (and the demo, which
  you can get right now), the ghosts are much, much creepier than the ones in the
  previous game, adding some more visual punch to go along with the previous game's
  excellent audio. Everything that held back the first game is being beefed up or
  stripped away entirely, leaving behind what's shaping up to be a powerful horror
  experience.\n\n        \n        Continue reading...\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:

  an exceptional library of minimalist puzzle games of outstanding quality. The three
  Hexcells games took mechanical inspirations from other puzzles like Minesweeper
  and Picross, expanding on them with stellar design and clever interactions to create
  phenomenal games. The newest title in the pseudo-series, Squarecells, recently released
  on Steam and continues this trend.\n\n        \n        Continue reading...\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:

  of classic. Franchises that have been around seemingly forever, or individual games
  that are still played and loved today, held together by strong, devoted communities.
  One such true classic, and one of the original games inspired by Rogue, Nethack
  has recently received an new official update after over a decade.\n\n        \n

  Indie Devs Team Up to Support Singaporean Game Convention\n\nDecember  8, 2015 11:30
  AM | Joel Couture\n\n  \n\nWhat better way is there to promote a game convention
  than by creating a game for it? Seow Zong Hui, developer of the awesome Street Fighter
  X Mega Man, joined up with producer Eliphant to create a free action platformer
  to showcase developers from Singapore's GameStart gaming convention. Witching Hour
  Studios (Masquerada: Songs and Shadows), Daylight Studios (Holy Potatoes! A Weapon
  Shop?!), and several other indies all make appearances with their own characters,
  each altering the gameplay in their own way.  Although the convention is over, you
  can still download and play the platformer, seeing many of the developers' first
  forays into sidescrolling action. So, grab it, start blasting enemies, try to pinpoint
  all the cameos, and maybe get yourself a little excited for what GameStart is going
  to have to show in 2016.\n\n        \n        Continue reading...\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:

  of Pinstripe\n\nDecember  8, 2015  7:45 AM | Konstantinos Dimopoulos / Gnome\n\n
  \ Pinstripe is absolutely gorgeous. It's also intricate, intriguing, impressive
  and created by a single individual, which not only makes it all the more impressive,
  but also a testament to what a talented and determined artist can achieve when working
  for four years: one of the most promising indie arcade adventures ever. And from
  what I've seen in the preview build I spent a couple hours with, Pinstripe already
  delivers on each and every imaginary promise it ever made.\n\nBut, seriously, why
  listen to me, when creator Thomas Brush is here to further enlighten you? No reason
  really...\n\n        \n        Continue reading...\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:

  Virtual Grappi - Happy Times in Happy Places with Happy Friends\n\nDecember  8,
  2015  6:00 AM | Joel Couture\n\n  \n\nHow hard can it be to keep a blob happy? I
  mean, Blobert was largely happy all through my playthrough of A Boy and his Blob,
  even as he watched me fall to my demise a few hundred times. So I figured I knew
  what was up when it came to taking care of my new gelatinous pal in Virtual Grappi.
  Still, how do you make a blob happy? Will a tire make him happy? Will a hat? What
  about a stun gun? Things just kind of happen when you give Grappi things, like turning
  its house into a beehive or making an alarming creature come to the window. Keeping
  the poor creature alive and happy with this hodgepodge of items isn't always easy,
  but it'll help create a friendship you'll treasure forever.\n\nUnless, you know,
  you accidentally send Grappi to a hellish nightmare world from which there's no
  escape. But how likely is that to happen?\n\n        \n        Continue reading...\n

  A Gift of Challenge - Retooling Odallus: The Dark Call for its New Veteran Mode\n\nDecember
  \ 7, 2015  8:30 AM | Joel Couture\n\n  \n\nHigher difficulties are a common lure
  to pull a player back into your game. Still, how do you make your game harder in
  a way that's interesting? Make the player less durable and give the enemies more
  health? Is that all there is to it? Danilo Dias, main programmer at JoyMasher, didn't
  think so as he created Odallus: The Dark Call's new Veteran Mode. He wanted \"A
  new challenge - familiar, but at the same time, different. A harder challenge for
  someone that already knows how the game works and wants more.\" \n\n        \n        Continue

  \ 7, 2015  7:00 AM | Konstantinos Dimopoulos / Gnome\n\n  Lumino City, the wonderfully
  handcrafted and quite frankly stunning puzzle adventure for Windows, Mac and iOS,
  has finally gotten its making of. Only it's not a write-up on sister site Gamasutra
  this time, but a clever and lovingly crafted freeware iOS app (iPad, iPhone) offering
  a highly intriguing behind the scenes look at the creation of the game. You'll see
  how Lumino City went from concept to paper models to a finished game, how its puzzles
  were designed and even how State of Play spent three years working on this lovely
  adventure. Oh, and you'll also get to play around with lights and cameras too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:

  audio and collaboration with developers\n\nDecember  6, 2015 11:45 PM | Lena LeRay\n\n
  \ Sharon Kho is one of the three people at Singapore-based game audio studio IMBA
  Interactive. They believe that audio should be considered a critical part of game
  design from the very beginning, rather than something to be tacked on later. It's
  a subject that Kho is passionate about. \"It is important that what we do is not
  just about providing high quality audio for games, but also about protecting the
  interests of the industry,\" she says. \"Through forging friendships with the games
  development community, we find ourselves constantly pushing for meaningful collaboration
  instead of unnecessary competition.\"\n\n        \n        Continue reading...\n

  GnomeIf you ask me, Gremlins Inc. is treating early access the way most games should.
  It already is in a fully playable and properly polished state that simply is not
  100% feature complete and solely needs your pre-release support in order to achieve
  its, hopefully glorious, complete form. But, what is Gremnlins Inc anyway, I pretend
  to hear you ask. Well, it's a beautiful and devilishly entertaining indie board
  game, that somehow managed to find itself on Steam's digital tabletop instead of,
  well, our collective and very physical tables.Tags: board game, early access, gremlins

  2015 12:00 PM | Joel CoutureSylvio was an eerie, chilling experience, frightening
  its players with an uncomfortable atmosphere as they sought to collect the spoken
  words of the dead through electronic voice phenomena. Hearing those phantoms was
  both sad and unsettling, but now, developer Stroboskop is looking to add some frightening
  visuals to the mix, giving protagonist Juliette Waters a video recorder for the
  game's sequel, Sylvio 2. Judging from these first looks (and the demo, which you
  can get right now), the ghosts are much, much creepier than the ones in the previous
  game, adding some more visual punch to go along with the previous game's excellent
  audio. Everything that held back the first game is being beefed up or stripped away
  entirely, leaving behind what's shaping up to be a powerful horror experience.Tags:

  produced an exceptional library of minimalist puzzle games of outstanding quality.
  The three Hexcells games took mechanical inspirations from other puzzles like Minesweeper
  and Picross, expanding on them with stellar design and clever interactions to create
  phenomenal games. The newest title in the pseudo-series, Squarecells, recently released
  on Steam and continues this trend.Tags: Linux, mac osx, Matthew Brown, puzzle, review,

  \ 8, 2015  2:00 PM | John Bridgman\nThere are times when games truly earn the title
  of classic. Franchises that have been around seemingly forever, or individual games
  that are still played and loved today, held together by strong, devoted communities.
  One such true classic, and one of the original games inspired by Rogue, Nethack
  has recently received an new official update after over a decade.Tags: NetHack,

  CoutureWhat better way is there to promote a game convention than by creating a
  game for it? Seow Zong Hui, developer of the awesome Street Fighter X Mega Man,
  joined up with producer Eliphant to create a free action platformer to showcase
  developers from Singapore's GameStart gaming convention. Witching Hour Studios (Masquerada:
  Songs and Shadows), Daylight Studios (Holy Potatoes! A Weapon Shop?!), and several
  other indies all make appearances with their own characters, each altering the gameplay
  in their own way.  Although the convention is over, you can still download and play
  the platformer, seeing many of the developers' first forays into sidescrolling action.
  So, grab it, start blasting enemies, try to pinpoint all the cameos, and maybe get
  yourself a little excited for what GameStart is going to have to show in 2016.Tags:

  AM | Konstantinos Dimopoulos / GnomePinstripe is absolutely gorgeous. It's also
  intricate, intriguing, impressive and created by a single individual, which not
  only makes it all the more impressive, but also a testament to what a talented and
  determined artist can achieve when working for four years: one of the most promising
  indie arcade adventures ever. And from what I've seen in the preview build I spent
  a couple hours with, Pinstripe already delivers on each and every imaginary promise
  it ever made.But, seriously, why listen to me, when creator Thomas Brush is here
  to further enlighten you? No reason really...Tags: action-adventure, atmos games,

  \ 8, 2015  6:00 AM | Joel CoutureHow hard can it be to keep a blob happy? I mean,
  Blobert was largely happy all through my playthrough of A Boy and his Blob, even
  as he watched me fall to my demise a few hundred times. So I figured I knew what
  was up when it came to taking care of my new gelatinous pal in Virtual Grappi. Still,
  how do you make a blob happy? Will a tire make him happy? Will a hat? What about
  a stun gun? Things just kind of happen when you give Grappi things, like turning
  its house into a beehive or making an alarming creature come to the window. Keeping
  the poor creature alive and happy with this hodgepodge of items isn't always easy,
  but it'll help create a friendship you'll treasure forever.Unless, you know, you
  accidentally send Grappi to a hellish nightmare world from which there's no escape.
  But how likely is that to happen?Tags: free, friendship, humor, simulation, sooz,

  difficulties are a common lure to pull a player back into your game. Still, how
  do you make your game harder in a way that's interesting? Make the player less durable
  and give the enemies more health? Is that all there is to it? Danilo Dias, main
  programmer at JoyMasher, didn't think so as he created Odallus: The Dark Call's
  new Veteran Mode. He wanted \"A new challenge - familiar, but at the same time,
  different. A harder challenge for someone that already knows how the game works
  and wants more.\" Tags: action, danilo dias, interview, joymasher, odallus, odallus:
