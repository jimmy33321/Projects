  Ever since the introduction of compulsory school attendance for all children, school textbooks have enjoyed considerable significance as instruments of socialization, particularly in the eyes of the state. Although we still know little about the ways in which the contents of textbooks are processed and learned, as a medium they undoubtedly influence many people during a phase of the life-cycle which often helps to shape their ideas for the rest of their lives. 'Textbook knowledge' is something that is seen to be the result of social discourse and thus a reflection of the Zeitgeist â and for that reason it is bound to be of interest to historians.1  Textbooks in subjects such as history or civics, which are likely to inspire concepts of identity and provide general social orientation, are of particular political significance, as debates throughout the world have shown. Thus the social and cultural knowledge found in textbooks not only reflects scholarly requirements and contemporary didactic codes: it is always of political relevance too, as this essay will show.

  In this article we examine how current social challenges that have changed and continue to change academic approaches to history have also influenced the concepts and contents of history textbooks in Germany. The article derives from an ongoing project of research into the relationship between history tuition in schools and new tendencies in historical scholarship: the latter include regional, transnational and global approaches; an interest in the mutual perceptions of Europeans and non-Europeans and of majority and minority groups; interest in 'entangled histories' or histoires croisÃ©es; and a gradually growing sensitivity to post-colonial interpretations. The rest of this article will examine some of the ways in which these new approaches have entered â or failed to enter â school history textbooks in the German education system.

  The German Education and Textbook System
- |
  'The German education system' is something of a misnomer. Although there is a basic national framework of compulsory coeducational schooling, for the most part state-run and free of charge,2  German education policy is controlled by sixteen separate federal states, each with its own ministry of education and its own curricula and standards.3  As a result, the many different curricula and textbooks do not only reflect new scholarly research. Beyond this, they also give voice to the opinions that are politically and culturally dominant in each German state and its public sphere. [End Page 125]  From a legal point of view, the power of definition is in the hands of the state governments; nevertheless, politicians, scholars and journalists as well as 'stakeholders' such as teachers' and parents' associations also participate in the discourse and the negotiations about what may or may not count and be canonically defined as approved knowledge, accepted values and popular memory.

  All German states follow a highly competitive and selective 'streaming' process that separates the more from the less academically gifted pupils at as young an age as ten.4  Those seen as less academically gifted are usually sent to the so-called Hauptschule, from which they will generally be expected to enter an apprenticeship in a manual trade. The middle stream is sent to the Realschule, from which they will hope to enter an apprenticeship in commerce or healthcare; a very few may attend college or university later. Pupils with the most academic promise â roughly thirty percent â may enrol at the Gymnasium, where they will be prepared for university entrance or a more prestigious apprenticeship, completing their schooling after twelve or thirteen years with the Abitur examination (equivalent to UK A-levels).5  For each type of school, the state governments compile specific curricula and approve textbooks from which schools may make their selections.
- |
  As a result of this system, there is a wide range of history textbooks to choose from, with a wealth of different didactic perspectives and contents. All state schools require a chronological approach to history, with coverage from the Stone Age until the present,6  and following the unification of Germany in 1989â90 many states revised their curricula to give more emphasis to the period after 1945.7  Approaches that go beyond chronology are usually only available to Gymnasium pupils at sixth-form level. Some states â Saxony or Bremen, for example â offer special topics at this level, such as 'Peace in the Twentieth Century' or 'History, Culture and Identity Construction', or longitudinal topics such as 'Gender History' or 'The Role of China'. But 'World History' courses are generally not offered, and in this German curricula and textbooks are clearly different from their Anglo Saxon counterparts.
- |
  A peculiarity of the German system is that all German schoolteachers undergo an academic, research-oriented education. As a result, the gap between historical scholarship and the school is relatively narrow and the ability of German teachers to recognize new trends at an early stage is comparatively high. In principle, then, curricula should be able to reflect the latest trends in historical scholarship. On the other hand, teachers at the Hauptschule undergo a shorter training and are quite often required to teach subjects for which they were not academically trained. In such environments, textbooks gain a special importance and status.

  Provisional Results of Our Analysis
- |
  These characteristics of the German educational system already make it difficult to provide an overview of the aims and contents of history [End Page 126]  curricula, on top of which there is also the wide range of textbooks to consider: nearly 150 textbooks are currently in use in contemporary history alone. We have restricted ourselves to a representative sample of some twenty of these, and will present here an overview and analysis of the most recent tendencies.

  Transcending the National Perspectives
- |
  The current history guidelines for all school types in all German states clearly attach much more importance to 'Europe', and particularly to the political process of European integration, than they did in the 1970s and 1980s.8  Nevertheless, there are considerable differences between concepts, areas of focus and didactic goals. For the most part, it is possible to identify partially conflicting approaches. On the one hand, the curricula of several states draw attention to the obstacles and difficulties of European integration, however well-meant the political intentions. The sixth-form curriculum in Lower Saxony, for instance, adheres quite closely to the current consensus of research, with European integration appearing as a positive goal but at the same time as laden with problems, which pupils are expected to discuss.9  Thus pupils can learn that history is constituted by many different perspectives, and the formation of a 'European idea' in both European and non-European contexts can be directly addressed.
- "But in other states curricula follow an approach that is almost the polar opposite.
  Here the idea of modern Europe is taken as a norm simply to be legitimated by history
  teaching. In the Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg guidelines, for example, history lessons are
  supposed to foster the 'development of a European identity'.10  This identity is
  almost uncritically assumed to be desirable and primarily a reflection of a 'cultural
  unity' of Europe, which â implicitly â is to be deduced from a common history built
  around Latin Christianity, Roman law and order, the Enlightenment and democracy.
  At no point do these curricula reflect the exclusionary implications of this approach
  (for many migrants or for Muslims who have been living in the Balkans for centuries,
  for instance), nor do they discuss the bias inherent in a concept of Europe defined
  explicitly in cultural or political terms. European history here seems to be largely
  identified with the history of the political institutions of the EU, and even if
  cultural aspects are addressed, this is mainly to support a teleological history
  of the EU. Diversity is verbally praised, yet â if we analyse underlying concepts
  and assumptions â in itself is hardly accepted as a European value or even a positive
  challenge.11  This kind of uncritical concept of history does not lend itself to
  the development of skills pertaining to critique of ideology or deconstruction of
  historical narratives.12  The 'European history' constructed here is astonishingly
  similar to the classical templates for national histories in the nineteenth century,
  except that, in this case, legitimacy relates to a different, supranational level.
  [End Page 127] \n"
- "Almost all curricula adopt clear European references and, to a certain extent,
  see German national history as part of European history. Yet the European perspective
  is not quite as prominent in the textbooks as one might expect from these curricula.
  Although they include the most important political periods and events, such as the
  French Revolution of 1789, and place selected episodes of German history, such as
  the 1848â9 revolution or the evolution of National Socialism, into a European context,
  Europe is only sporadically discussed, usually only in terms of its political history
  and with a bias toward western and central Europe. For the period from the eighteenth
  to the twentieth century (the time-frame on which our analysis focuses), the primary
  object of interest is the implementation of the 'European Project' after 1945, despite
  the fact that this period is also frequently dealt with in detail by social studies
  and geography textbooks. And because the dominant viewpoint is focused on 'progress'
  towards this project, it only rarely includes alternative options and contradictory
  developments or portrays Europe as an area of competing as well as converging memories.
  The Franco-German history book, published in 2006 for sixth-form level and approved
  for use in all German states, is one of the few exceptions in that it attempts to
  highlight different memories of the same event and to discuss the reasons for these.13
  \n"
- "Textbooks rarely present Europe and its boundaries as historically changeable and
  negotiated constructs and self-images, which also mirror representations of Europe
  in the non-European world.14  The textbook Tempora vol. 2, for example, focuses
  on the European issue in a chapter promisingly entitled 'Regional Integration under
  the Influence of Hegemonic Zones'.15  Here, however, as in many other textbooks,
  the concern is primarily with the political development of Western Europe up to
  the present and in the context of general postwar history. Both the meaning and
  definition of Europe over time, and a transnational or a (pan-)European perspective
  on history-writing and analysis, remain for the most part unexplored. The dominant
  teleological and positive concept of 'Europe' again becomes obvious when Poland's
  membership of the European Union is presented in another textbook as simply a 'return'
  to Europe, rather than possibly an 'expansion' of Europe.16  Here textbook authors
  lose the opportunity to discuss divergent interpretations and to encourage pupils'
  capacity to identify and critique master narratives. Even when German history textbooks
  cite or quote from specialist works, these are too often presented as facts rather
  than as interpretations, and differing viewpoints are not juxtaposed.17 \n"
- "In relation to national narratives and traditional representations of national
  identity, on the other hand, the verdict on the textbooks can be more positive.
  Almost all the textbooks we examined take a critical distance on German history,
  avoiding national myths or alternatively giving the pupils the tools with which
  to deconstruct them.18  Sustained by an almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic
  undertone, German textbooks attempt [End Page 128]  to define clearly the difference
  between historical burdens and trustworthiness in the present. This basic tendency
  essentially results from a national history that has been repeatedly obliged to
  confront the barbarism of National Socialism and the Holocaust. The term 'nation'
  is therefore seldom used with a positive connotation, and even in the more conservative
  states is frequently associated with the dangers of nationalism. Even the 'event
  of the [twentieth] century', German reunification, is for the most part portrayed
  in a restrained manner and mostly free of patriotism.19  In the books' underlying
  assumptions, we rarely encounter concepts of 'the enemy' or sharply defined strategies
  of exclusion, but rather a system of values consistent with principles formulated
  by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, thus oriented
  towards human rights, democracy and peace.20 \n"
- "However, none of this means that history is derived or recounted from transnational
  perspectives. In this respect, the findings of our analysis differ from those of
  Yasemin Soysal, who recently argued that German textbooks were virtually allowing
  the concept of the nation to disappear, and instead focusing on a globalizing and
  diversifying world.21  We concur with her impression that German textbooks usually
  downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship
  centred on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness,
  and she is equally correct in her view that Germany is treated as a part of Europe.
  Yet attempts to treat national, European and global approaches as real equivalents
  are rare. More often the world and Europe are considered primarily from a German
  perspective; only a handful of texts deal with European or even non-European developments
  in their own right.22  Unlike recent social studies textbooks, most history textbooks
  still fail to embed national history into a global approach; at best, it becomes
  part of a 'Western-civilization' framework.23  And even this framework loses importance
  the closer the books come to the present day. While books that cover the period
  from the Stone Age up to the Renaissance or the Enlightenment follow a broader regional
  view, the history of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries â except in the sections
  on imperialism and the Cold War â is clearly written from the perspective of German
  history. They thus underestimate the impact of transnational processes, of transcultural
  interaction and transregional transfers of ideas, goods and people, including in
  relation to European integration.24  Given that there are no specialist lessons
  on 'world history' in Germany, while by contrast classrooms are subject to the effects
  of globalization and a multinational student body, this is a significant defect.25

  Gender History
- "The importance of gender roles and gender concepts is widely accepted by scholars
  as a fundamental dimension of history, and in principle it is also approved by most
  German school curricula. This surprisingly positive [End Page 129]  finding is limited,
  however, by the fact that in most cases this perspective is not developed intensively
  until sixth-form level and is therefore not encountered in any depth by at least
  two-thirds of German pupils. Nevertheless, in some German states, such as North
  Rhine-Westphalia or Bremen, school bureaucracy has established a much more open
  attitude towards 'gender' in history (and not just women's history) than prevailed
  a generation ago.26  Other states, however, show considerable gaps here, and gender
  history is often reduced to 'women's history', which in turn is limited to a small
  number of topics such as the Industrial Revolution or the emancipation of women.27

  Once again, the textbooks do not make full use of the opportunities offered by the curricula to integrate the findings of recent historical scholarship. They hardly ever address gender as a historical category or even employ it as an analytical instrument. Still, textbooks are not the only (and perhaps not even the primary) targets for this criticism: a wealth of academic works can also be considered guilty of the same neglect.
- |
  This verdict can be modified somewhat if we consider the impact of the increasing quantity of 'women's history' produced over the past two decades, which can hardly be ignored by any contemporary textbook. Most textbooks offer a narrative (often somewhat moralizing) of the liberation of women and a thorough and critical analysis of the process. The 'Path of Women towards Equality' is usually pursued through many historical events, though sometimes taken out of its historical context (and in some cases it is obvious that the publisher has merely added some paragraphs or chapters on women without any change to the books' overall approach).28  This is a significant example of authors' recognition of their obligation to reflect and obey the Zeitgeist.29  Yet the conclusion remains that German textbooks have only rarely digested the concepts of modern gender history. They remain focused on women's emancipation, which in most textbooks is seen as a concept successfully developed in the West and closely related to democracy â and this underlying assumption is not disclosed or discussed.

  Postcolonial Studies
- |
  Since the 1980s the history profession has increasingly opened up to postcolonial theories, especially in the Anglo-Saxon world. The various violent or non-violent forms assumed by power, hegemony and cultural contact between the 'West' and the 'rest' were at the centre of this interest, together with the question of how colonialism affected the colonized peoples and the self-image of Europe and the Europeans. In examining how the teaching of history has been influenced by these new approaches and interests, we should bear in mind that colonialism as well as decolonization has not been as important an issue for Germany as for Belgium, Great Britain or France, for instance. Furthermore, research approaches in this field are still relatively new in Germany, having only begun in the mid 1990s, and they have yet to make their mark on scholarly discourse.30  In the light of this and [End Page 130]  of the long delay between the emergence of new scholarship and its wider dissemination, our expectations of curricula and textbooks must not be placed too high. Although most of the curricula we analysed include the topics of 'Colonialism' and 'Decolonization', the shifts of perspective necessary for postcolonial approaches are incorporated into curricula and guidelines in only a few German states, and even then mostly limited to sixth-form level.
- |
  The extreme differences among the curricula are especially striking at sixth-form level. Here we find almost every variation, from ignoring the topic altogether to discussing the issue in a fashion that at times comes close to scholarly approaches. Some states, such as Lower Saxony,31  demonstrate a considerable willingness to experiment (as with the topic of gender history) and welcome this issue with interest; other states, particularly Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg and Bavaria,32  are diffident about postcolonial approaches; and some completely ignore them.
- "It is not surprising, therefore, that the results of the textbook analysis were
  fairly uniform and disappointing. Nearly all textbooks need to be updated, with
  a few exceptions. To be sure, imperialism and colonialism â if they are mentioned
  at all â are not depicted primarily as 'civilizing missions' but rather as a history
  of violence and exploitation, inequality and disregard for native cultures. Tempora
  2, for instance, dedicates an entire section to the topic 'North and South â Inequality
  in the World' (pp. 459â87). Yet a critical postcolonial perspective on modernization
  seldom figures: instead, an almost uncritical image of the Western path to modernity
  underlies the portrayal (p. 463).33 \n"
- |
  Moreover, primary sources from the pen of the ruling forces tend to dominate; the colonized remain for the most part without a voice, and sometimes are not even visible. This reinforces the one-way transfer of knowledge to the pupils. In most German textbooks there is little trace of an 'entangled' history, in which pupils can learn how different cultures and societies have shared a wealth of experiences, both positive and negative, and in which they can be sensitized to processes of interaction and interdependence between Europe and the world regions (previously) colonized by Europeans.
- "Only a few textbooks make it clear that one culture has conquered, reshaped, altered
  and destroyed another in order to rule, or that other forms of colonization, even
  if primarily non-violent, are still in effect even today â for instance, via language
  or academic cultures. Some imbalances, such as the economic legacies of European
  colonial policies, are mentioned with increasing regularity. However, more reflective
  questions as to how the self and the 'other' are construed are extremely rare. Similarly,
  the many Eurocentric interpretations that pupils still encounter in their daily
  lives are barely subjected to debate. European history may have achieved a higher
  standing than national history alone, yet it has not been truly extended into a
  world history or written from an external perspective. [End Page 131] \n"

  Representations of Minorities
- "It was only quite recently, by comparison with many of its European neighbours,
  that Germany accepted its status as a country of immigration, which is almost certainly
  due to its low level of post-colonial migration. The issue of 'migration and education'
  was for a long time subordinate to the assumption that there would be a stronger
  stake in cultural homogeneity. But wider public debate developed with the accumulation
  of problems at the end of the 1990s and especially after the 2003 PISA Test produced
  disastrous results from German schoolchildren, particularly with regard to immigrant
  children (second as well as first-generation immigrants).34  Growing importance
  is attached in history teaching to the question whose history is relevant and who
  should â or should not â enjoy authority and agency in a historical perspective.35
  \n"
- |
  All school curricula include the theme of other cultures. Even the most conservative states define tolerance and empathy towards ethnic or religious minorities, as well as human-rights education, as central educational goals. The Bavarian history curriculum, for example, declares,
- "It is part of everyday life that pupils from completely different European and
  non-European countries learn and work together in a class, and it reflects a part
  of our life as a society. It is part of the educational and disciplinary task of
  the Realschule to use this situation to good educational effect, preparing pupils
  for a life in which people and cultures live together respecting human rights, supporting
  one another and tackling differences of opinion and conflicts in a peaceful manner.36
  \n"
- |
  But how do curricula try to implement these goals? How should the perspectives of ethnic, religious or cultural minorities be represented and integrated into history education? Is it merely a question of tolerating the 'other', or is it rather a matter of respect, representation and ultimately of a citizenship education that addresses all children on an equal footing?
- |
  It is difficult to give definitive answers to these questions. Some curricula focus on 'tolerance' and consider immigrants and other minorities largely as objects of study. Others ask teachers and textbook authors to shift perspectives and to see immigrants in the role of subjects.37  The marginalization of global perspectives proves to be disadvantageous in this respect. As 'the world' is now sitting in the classroom, it would make sense to integrate it further into history lessons, and to place greater importance on discussing concepts of self and 'other' in history and culture.
- "In reality, however, curricula in more than half the German states, including Bremen,
  Hesse, Saxony, Thuringia, Saarland, Bavaria and Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, tend to ignore
  the global as well as the postcolonial dimensions of history. Lower Saxony and North
  Rhine-Westphalia deal with the topic quite admirably, but again mainly in the sixth
  form. So a large percentage of German pupils never have the opportunity to recognize
  [End Page 132]  changing perceptions and the conflicts surrounding them. The same
  is true of portrayals of the religious history of Europe, which is depicted with
  far less complexity and differentiation in curricula for the Realschule or, even
  more, for the Hauptschule than those for the Gymnasium. This is problematic in view
  of the fact that the student bodies of the Hauptschule are dramatically more diverse
  in terms of religion and ethnicity.38 \n"
- |
  How do the textbooks deal with questions that challenge the education system in all federal states? As a general rule, it can be said that all recent textbooks accept the increasing diversity of cultural patterns and the presence of immigrants in numerous facets of society as a productive challenge, and make efforts to dedicate more space in the textbooks to minority issues. Often, as with gender history, this is only achieved by adding new chapters â on such topics as the history of migration or the coexistence of minorities and majorities. Some new textbooks explicitly point out that Germany and Europe have always been characterized by migration, cultural contacts and the fact that different social, religious or ethnic groups have lived together, both amicably and with conflict.39  Generally, however, almost no history textbooks address shifts between minority and majority perspectives or tensions between perceptions of the self and the 'other' as a basis for understanding the whole or to show the fundamental role of cultural diversity and transfer, as well as the conflicts they involve over time.
- |
  In the textbooks immigrants and other minorities somehow always remain the 'others'. They appear as either the victims or the culprits of unfortunate developments, always somehow 'a problem' for the majority.40  Furthermore, pictures of immigrants in almost all textbooks tend to equip them with features typically associated with 'otherness' â particular skin and hair colour or a certain type of clothing.41  The label of 'other' thus remains, and stereotypes are reinforced rather than dissolved. This does not exactly support the increased understanding of the 'other' envisaged by education bureaucrats.
- |
  It is, however, extremely difficult to escape this interpretative trap. The challenge for authors of implementing an integrative concept is exemplified by the manner in which Jewish history is integrated â or perhaps we should say not integrated â into general or German history.42  The detailed study of the Shoah is now solidly established as a horrific chapter of German history; and Holocaust education has long served in all German schools as an important instrument of general human-rights education and of teaching pupils to think beyond national perspectives.
- |
  This is without a doubt a welcome development. It does, however, still make it difficult for curriculum and textbook authors to convey Jewish history as 'beyond tragedy' and detached from the perspective of the victims. The space allocated to aspects of Jewish history in German textbooks has dramatically increased since the mid 1990s. Textbooks have also been making efforts to work with multiple perspectives in the chapters on [End Page 133]  National Socialism, and to give a voice to the persecuted, the humiliated and the resistance alongside the sources from the perpetrators, which still tend to dominate. The processes of integration and assimilation remain for the most part unknown to the pupils, with the result that a centuries-long history of a complex relationship that was rich in tension, yet at the same time extremely fruitful, is frequently reduced to one of persecution and discrimination. Either Jewish history is dealt with in special chapters, thus encouraging a sense of 'otherness'; or the Jews are contrasted with the majority and presented primarily in the role of victims. These depictions distort not only the pupils' view of Jewish aspects of German national history, but also their understanding of significant inner-Jewish developments such as the Haskalah, the Jewish Enlightenment. The consequence is obvious: Jews seldom appear as active players, and this encourages the impression that historical agency was enjoyed only by the (non-Jewish) majority, shifting the minority further into a subaltern status.43  The fact that hardly any textbooks mention the refounding of Jewish communities in postwar Germany serves to support this impression. The message, if unintentional, is that Jews have only a tragic history in Germany. Their present and future are barely touched upon.
- |
  The case is somewhat different for representations of Muslims, no doubt because of their present situation in Germany. Muslims figure in textbooks with particular frequency in chapters dealing with the crusades and violent advances of Islam towards Europe. The hidden messages â including those conveyed in illustrations â are often problematic, both for the past and the present. Muslims appear either as immigrants who have problems or cause them, or as terrorists.44  Textbook readers almost never encounter Muslims who have been living in Europe as Europeans for centuries, for instance in the Balkans or in Russian Tatarstan. It is especially problematic here that Islam is either discussed largely in the context of global security issues or depicted as a purely religious phenomenon, and then in an essentialist, idealized form (Christianity, on the other hand, is depicted historically). Although Islam has been a component of European history for centuries, it is portrayed in most textbooks as an 'other' that is somehow foreign and 'oriental'.
- "Nevertheless a linear analysis of the Islam narrative in German textbooks does
  reveal some changes, such as the now frequent portrayal of the crusades as a history
  shared by different cultures, and not just a military encounter. Additionally, some
  textbooks make efforts to give a voice to both sides and to provide pupils with
  opportunities to learn about the different points of view and reach their own judgements.
  As Gerdien Jonker has pointed out, 'In this narrative, German identity is no longer
  the issue. It has been replaced by a search for Europe's status in world society.'45
  \n"
- "This turn towards a European perspective, albeit via harmonized and affirmational
  tendencies, certainly brings new opportunities. On the one hand, European history
  has always enjoyed a certain plurality (and, in the [End Page 134]  Balkans, a Muslim
  majority), despite the dominance of Christianity. Europe is thus confronted with
  diversity and has to deal with it; a European identity free of openness towards
  'others' and 'outsiders' is unthinkable. On the other hand, the Europeanization
  of minority histories can place historic phenomena such as emancipation and anti-semitism
  into a larger context, thus helping to historicize them.46  At the same time, however,
  it appears that the non-Christian minorities have become the 'victims' of a stronger
  focus on Europe and its history: the more defined the search for common European
  traditions, the stronger the focus on 'legitimating' Europe in its roots in Latin
  Christianity and the religious Enlightenment, and with this the secularization of
  the state.47 \n"
- |
  Up until now, and unlike in the USA, hardly any powerful lobby for adequate representation of minorities has existed in Germany. In this regard, the practice of merely 'mentioning' minorities, and thereby confirming their powerlessness, is as rare in Germany as the structural broadening of textbook contents that it would entail.48  The number of pages in German history textbooks has remained relatively constant for years â about 300 pages for years nine and ten. This means that in Germany â unlike in the USA, where pupils are confronted with books of a thousand pages, because each social group demands adequate representation in textbooks and possesses the power to get it â the incorporation of new aspects must be 'bought' at the cost of other aspects.
- |
  Conclusion
- |
  German curricula and textbooks have adopted new specialist historical and didactic concepts in a wide variety of ways. Due to the federal structure of the education system and to the existence of different school types, the conceptions of historical knowledge and the main aims of history teaching vary significantly from state to state and also from one school type to another, as this essay has aimed to show. All curricula need updating in some aspects: this is recognized both in education policy and also by textbook authors and publishers, and most curricula and textbooks demonstrate that attempts are being made to keep up to date and to adopt at least main ideas of modern historical scholarship and pedagogy.
- |
  As a general rule, the textbooks try hard to address current affairs and developments. Almost all textbooks published in the last few years refer to the events of 11 September 2001, or to the contradictory process of globalization.49  Equally, the majority of history textbooks now deal with aspects of social, everyday and cultural history alongside the classical approaches of political history and high culture, to a far greater extent than in the 1970s and 1980s. But international or transnational perspectives are generally restricted to the history of politics, diplomacy and events. For reasons related to approval systems, politics and the market economy, the underlying tendency of German textbooks remains conservative in many respects. They are nevertheless open to new concepts, even in matters of design. [End Page 135]  The modern textbook may not offer everything the pupil's heart might desire in terms of visual layout and graphics, yet the general portrayal, the scholarship and the pedagogical and educational concepts are pupil-focused and receptive to new ideas. Almost all history books do offer practical advice on historical work, and most textbooks, especially those for Gymnasium and Realschule, follow the concept of a workbook, albeit with varying consistency. They always include specific chapters on multiple perspectives and methods of historical thinking, offering a history based on interpretation with the textbook as a source. Most German textbooks, especially those for Gymnasium, try to meet the important didactic criteria of multi-perspectivity, recognition of conflicting opinions and training in the ability to deconstruct narratives or historical myths. But whether this will now change as a result of the move towards a more test-oriented educational system remains to be seen.

- "Download PDFEver since the introduction of compulsory school attendance for all
  children, school textbooks have enjoyed considerable significance as instruments
  of socialization, particularly in the eyes of the state. Although we still know
  little about the ways in which the contents of textbooks are processed and learned,
  as a medium they undoubtedly influence many people during a phase of the life-cycle
  which often helps to shape their ideas for the rest of their lives. 'Textbook knowledge'
  is something that is seen to be the result of social discourse and thus a reflection
  of the Zeitgeist â and for that reason it is bound to be of interest to historians.1
  \ Textbooks in subjects such as history or civics, which are likely to inspire concepts
  of identity and provide general social orientation, are of particular political
  significance, as debates throughout the world have shown. Thus the social and cultural
  knowledge found in textbooks not only reflects scholarly requirements and contemporary
  didactic codes: it is always of political relevance too, as this essay will show.In
  this article we examine how current social challenges that have changed and continue
  to change academic approaches to history have also influenced the concepts and contents
  of history textbooks in Germany. The article derives from an ongoing project of
  research into the relationship between history tuition in schools and new tendencies
  in historical scholarship: the latter include regional, transnational and global
  approaches; an interest in the mutual perceptions of Europeans and non-Europeans
  and of majority and minority groups; interest in 'entangled histories' or histoires
  croisÃ©es; and a gradually growing sensitivity to post-colonial interpretations.
  The rest of this article will examine some of the ways in which these new approaches
  have entered â or failed to enter â school history textbooks in the German education
  system.'The German education system' is something of a misnomer. Although there
  is a basic national framework of compulsory coeducational schooling, for the most
  part state-run and free of charge,2  German education policy is controlled by sixteen
  separate federal states, each with its own ministry of education and its own curricula
  and standards.3  As a result, the many different curricula and textbooks do not
  only reflect new scholarly research. Beyond this, they also give voice to the opinions
  that are politically and culturally dominant in each German state and its public
  sphere. [End Page 125]  From a legal point of view, the power of definition is in
  the hands of the state governments; nevertheless, politicians, scholars and journalists
  as well as 'stakeholders' such as teachers' and parents' associations also participate
  in the discourse and the negotiations about what may or may not count and be canonically
  defined as approved knowledge, accepted values and popular memory.All German states
  follow a highly competitive and selective 'streaming' process that separates the
  more from the less academically gifted pupils at as young an age as ten.4  Those
  seen as less academically gifted are usually sent to the so-called Hauptschule,
  from which they will generally be expected to enter an apprenticeship in a manual
  trade. The middle stream is sent to the Realschule, from which they will hope to
  enter an apprenticeship in commerce or healthcare; a very few may attend college
  or university later. Pupils with the most academic promise â roughly thirty percent
  â may enrol at the Gymnasium, where they will be prepared for university entrance
  or a more prestigious apprenticeship, completing their schooling after twelve or
  thirteen years with the Abitur examination (equivalent to UK A-levels).5  For each
  type of school, the state governments compile specific curricula and approve textbooks
  from which schools may make their selections.As a result of this system, there is
  a wide range of history textbooks to choose from, with a wealth of different didactic
  perspectives and contents. All state schools require a chronological approach to
  history, with coverage from the Stone Age until the present,6  and following the
  unification of Germany in 1989â90 many states revised their curricula to give more
  emphasis to the period after 1945.7  Approaches that go beyond chronology are usually
  only available to Gymnasium pupils at sixth-form level. Some states â Saxony or
  Bremen, for example â offer special topics at this level, such as 'Peace in the
  Twentieth Century' or 'History, Culture and Identity Construction', or longitudinal
  topics such as 'Gender History' or 'The Role of China'. But 'World History' courses
  are generally not offered, and in this German curricula and textbooks are clearly
  different from their Anglo Saxon counterparts.A peculiarity of the German system
  is that all German schoolteachers undergo an academic, research-oriented education.
  As a result, the gap between historical scholarship and the school is relatively
  narrow and the ability of German teachers to recognize new trends at an early stage
  is comparatively high. In principle, then, curricula should be able to reflect the
  latest trends in historical scholarship. On the other hand, teachers at the Hauptschule
  undergo a shorter training and are quite often required to teach subjects for which
  they were not academically trained. In such environments, textbooks gain a special
  importance and status.These characteristics of the German educational system already
  make it difficult to provide an overview of the aims and contents of history [End
  Page 126]  curricula, on top of which there is also the wide range of textbooks
  to consider: nearly 150 textbooks are currently in use in contemporary history alone.
  We have restricted ourselves to a representative sample of some twenty of these,
  and will present here an overview and analysis of the most recent tendencies.The
  current history guidelines for all school types in all German states clearly attach
  much more importance to 'Europe', and particularly to the political process of European
  integration, than they did in the 1970s and 1980s.8  Nevertheless, there are considerable
  differences between concepts, areas of focus and didactic goals. For the most part,
  it is possible to identify partially conflicting approaches. On the one hand, the
  curricula of several states draw attention to the obstacles and difficulties of
  European integration, however well-meant the political intentions. The sixth-form
  curriculum in Lower Saxony, for instance, adheres quite closely to the current consensus
  of research, with European integration appearing as a positive goal but at the same
  time as laden with problems, which pupils are expected to discuss.9  Thus pupils
  can learn that history is constituted by many different perspectives, and the formation
  of a 'European idea' in both European and non-European contexts can be directly
  addressed.But in other states curricula follow an approach that is almost the polar
  opposite. Here the idea of modern Europe is taken as a norm simply to be legitimated
  by history teaching. In the Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg guidelines, for example, history lessons
  are supposed to foster the 'development of a European identity'.10  This identity
  is almost uncritically assumed to be desirable and primarily a reflection of a 'cultural
  unity' of Europe, which â implicitly â is to be deduced from a common history built
  around Latin Christianity, Roman law and order, the Enlightenment and democracy.
  At no point do these curricula reflect the exclusionary implications of this approach
  (for many migrants or for Muslims who have been living in the Balkans for centuries,
  for instance), nor do they discuss the bias inherent in a concept of Europe defined
  explicitly in cultural or political terms. European history here seems to be largely
  identified with the history of the political institutions of the EU, and even if
  cultural aspects are addressed, this is mainly to support a teleological history
  of the EU. Diversity is verbally praised, yet â if we analyse underlying concepts
  and assumptions â in itself is hardly accepted as a European value or even a positive
  challenge.11  This kind of uncritical concept of history does not lend itself to
  the development of skills pertaining to critique of ideology or deconstruction of
  historical narratives.12  The 'European history' constructed here is astonishingly
  similar to the classical templates for national histories in the nineteenth century,
  except that, in this case, legitimacy relates to a different, supranational level.
  [End Page 127] Almost all curricula adopt clear European references and, to a certain
  extent, see German national history as part of European history. Yet the European
  perspective is not quite as prominent in the textbooks as one might expect from
  these curricula. Although they include the most important political periods and
  events, such as the French Revolution of 1789, and place selected episodes of German
  history, such as the 1848â9 revolution or the evolution of National Socialism, into
  a European context, Europe is only sporadically discussed, usually only in terms
  of its political history and with a bias toward western and central Europe. For
  the period from the eighteenth to the twentieth century (the time-frame on which
  our analysis focuses), the primary object of interest is the implementation of the
  'European Project' after 1945, despite the fact that this period is also frequently
  dealt with in detail by social studies and geography textbooks. And because the
  dominant viewpoint is focused on 'progress' towards this project, it only rarely
  includes alternative options and contradictory developments or portrays Europe as
  an area of competing as well as converging memories. The Franco-German history book,
  published in 2006 for sixth-form level and approved for use in all German states,
  is one of the few exceptions in that it attempts to highlight different memories
  of the same event and to discuss the reasons for these.13 Textbooks rarely present
  Europe and its boundaries as historically changeable and negotiated constructs and
  self-images, which also mirror representations of Europe in the non-European world.14
  \ The textbook Tempora vol. 2, for example, focuses on the European issue in a chapter
  promisingly entitled 'Regional Integration under the Influence of Hegemonic Zones'.15
  \ Here, however, as in many other textbooks, the concern is primarily with the political
  development of Western Europe up to the present and in the context of general postwar
  history. Both the meaning and definition of Europe over time, and a transnational
  or a (pan-)European perspective on history-writing and analysis, remain for the
  most part unexplored. The dominant teleological and positive concept of 'Europe'
  again becomes obvious when Poland's membership of the European Union is presented
  in another textbook as simply a 'return' to Europe, rather than possibly an 'expansion'
  of Europe.16  Here textbook authors lose the opportunity to discuss divergent interpretations
  and to encourage pupils' capacity to identify and critique master narratives. Even
  when German history textbooks cite or quote from specialist works, these are too
  often presented as facts rather than as interpretations, and differing viewpoints
  are not juxtaposed.17 In relation to national narratives and traditional representations
  of national identity, on the other hand, the verdict on the textbooks can be more
  positive. Almost all the textbooks we examined take a critical distance on German
  history, avoiding national myths or alternatively giving the pupils the tools with
  which to deconstruct them.18  Sustained by an almost pacifistic and deliberately
  unpatriotic undertone, German textbooks attempt [End Page 128]  to define clearly
  the difference between historical burdens and trustworthiness in the present. This
  basic tendency essentially results from a national history that has been repeatedly
  obliged to confront the barbarism of National Socialism and the Holocaust. The term
  'nation' is therefore seldom used with a positive connotation, and even in the more
  conservative states is frequently associated with the dangers of nationalism. Even
  the 'event of the [twentieth] century', German reunification, is for the most part
  portrayed in a restrained manner and mostly free of patriotism.19  In the books'
  underlying assumptions, we rarely encounter concepts of 'the enemy' or sharply defined
  strategies of exclusion, but rather a system of values consistent with principles
  formulated by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe,
  thus oriented towards human rights, democracy and peace.20 However, none of this
  means that history is derived or recounted from transnational perspectives. In this
  respect, the findings of our analysis differ from those of Yasemin Soysal, who recently
  argued that German textbooks were virtually allowing the concept of the nation to
  disappear, and instead focusing on a globalizing and diversifying world.21  We concur
  with her impression that German textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions
  and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centred on democracy, progress,
  human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness, and she is equally correct in her
  view that Germany is treated as a part of Europe. Yet attempts to treat national,
  European and global approaches as real equivalents are rare. More often the world
  and Europe are considered primarily from a German perspective; only a handful of
  texts deal with European or even non-European developments in their own right.22
  \ Unlike recent social studies textbooks, most history textbooks still fail to embed
  national history into a global approach; at best, it becomes part of a 'Western-civilization'
  framework.23  And even this framework loses importance the closer the books come
  to the present day. While books that cover the period from the Stone Age up to the
  Renaissance or the Enlightenment follow a broader regional view, the history of
  the nineteenth and twentieth centuries â except in the sections on imperialism and
  the Cold War â is clearly written from the perspective of German history. They thus
  underestimate the impact of transnational processes, of transcultural interaction
  and transregional transfers of ideas, goods and people, including in relation to
  European integration.24  Given that there are no specialist lessons on 'world history'
  in Germany, while by contrast classrooms are subject to the effects of globalization
  and a multinational student body, this is a significant defect.25 The importance
  of gender roles and gender concepts is widely accepted by scholars as a fundamental
  dimension of history, and in principle it is also approved by most German school
  curricula. This surprisingly positive [End Page 129]  finding is limited, however,
  by the fact that in most cases this perspective is not developed intensively until
  sixth-form level and is therefore not encountered in any depth by at least two-thirds
  of German pupils. Nevertheless, in some German states, such as North Rhine-Westphalia
  or Bremen, school bureaucracy has established a much more open attitude towards
  'gender' in history (and not just women's history) than prevailed a generation ago.26
  \ Other states, however, show considerable gaps here, and gender history is often
  reduced to 'women's history', which in turn is limited to a small number of topics
  such as the Industrial Revolution or the emancipation of women.27 Once again, the
  textbooks do not make full use of the opportunities offered by the curricula to
  integrate the findings of recent historical scholarship. They hardly ever address
  gender as a historical category or even employ it as an analytical instrument. Still,
  textbooks are not the only (and perhaps not even the primary) targets for this criticism:
  a wealth of academic works can also be considered guilty of the same neglect.This
  verdict can be modified somewhat if we consider the impact of the increasing quantity
  of 'women's history' produced over the past two decades, which can hardly be ignored
  by any contemporary textbook. Most textbooks offer a narrative (often somewhat moralizing)
  of the liberation of women and a thorough and critical analysis of the process.
  The 'Path of Women towards Equality' is usually pursued through many historical
  events, though sometimes taken out of its historical context (and in some cases
  it is obvious that the publisher has merely added some paragraphs or chapters on
  women without any change to the books' overall approach).28  This is a significant
  example of authors' recognition of their obligation to reflect and obey the Zeitgeist.29
  \ Yet the conclusion remains that German textbooks have only rarely digested the
  concepts of modern gender history. They remain focused on women's emancipation,
  which in most textbooks is seen as a concept successfully developed in the West
  and closely related to democracy â and this underlying assumption is not disclosed
  or discussed.Since the 1980s the history profession has increasingly opened up to
  postcolonial theories, especially in the Anglo-Saxon world. The various violent
  or non-violent forms assumed by power, hegemony and cultural contact between the
  'West' and the 'rest' were at the centre of this interest, together with the question
  of how colonialism affected the colonized peoples and the self-image of Europe and
  the Europeans. In examining how the teaching of history has been influenced by these
  new approaches and interests, we should bear in mind that colonialism as well as
  decolonization has not been as important an issue for Germany as for Belgium, Great
  Britain or France, for instance. Furthermore, research approaches in this field
  are still relatively new in Germany, having only begun in the mid 1990s, and they
  have yet to make their mark on scholarly discourse.30  In the light of this and
  [End Page 130]  of the long delay between the emergence of new scholarship and its
  wider dissemination, our expectations of curricula and textbooks must not be placed
  too high. Although most of the curricula we analysed include the topics of 'Colonialism'
  and 'Decolonization', the shifts of perspective necessary for postcolonial approaches
  are incorporated into curricula and guidelines in only a few German states, and
  even then mostly limited to sixth-form level.The extreme differences among the curricula
  are especially striking at sixth-form level. Here we find almost every variation,
  from ignoring the topic altogether to discussing the issue in a fashion that at
  times comes close to scholarly approaches. Some states, such as Lower Saxony,31
  \ demonstrate a considerable willingness to experiment (as with the topic of gender
  history) and welcome this issue with interest; other states, particularly Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg
  and Bavaria,32  are diffident about postcolonial approaches; and some completely
  ignore them.It is not surprising, therefore, that the results of the textbook analysis
  were fairly uniform and disappointing. Nearly all textbooks need to be updated,
  with a few exceptions. To be sure, imperialism and colonialism â if they are mentioned
  at all â are not depicted primarily as 'civilizing missions' but rather as a history
  of violence and exploitation, inequality and disregard for native cultures. Tempora
  2, for instance, dedicates an entire section to the topic 'North and South â Inequality
  in the World' (pp. 459â87). Yet a critical postcolonial perspective on modernization
  seldom figures: instead, an almost uncritical image of the Western path to modernity
  underlies the portrayal (p. 463).33 Moreover, primary sources from the pen of the
  ruling forces tend to dominate; the colonized remain for the most part without a
  voice, and sometimes are not even visible. This reinforces the one-way transfer
  of knowledge to the pupils. In most German textbooks there is little trace of an
  'entangled' history, in which pupils can learn how different cultures and societies
  have shared a wealth of experiences, both positive and negative, and in which they
  can be sensitized to processes of interaction and interdependence between Europe
  and the world regions (previously) colonized by Europeans.Only a few textbooks make
  it clear that one culture has conquered, reshaped, altered and destroyed another
  in order to rule, or that other forms of colonization, even if primarily non-violent,
  are still in effect even today â for instance, via language or academic cultures.
  Some imbalances, such as the economic legacies of European colonial policies, are
  mentioned with increasing regularity. However, more reflective questions as to how
  the self and the 'other' are construed are extremely rare. Similarly, the many Eurocentric
  interpretations that pupils still encounter in their daily lives are barely subjected
  to debate. European history may have achieved a higher standing than national history
  alone, yet it has not been truly extended into a world history or written from an
  external perspective. [End Page 131] It was only quite recently, by comparison with
  many of its European neighbours, that Germany accepted its status as a country of
  immigration, which is almost certainly due to its low level of post-colonial migration.
  The issue of 'migration and education' was for a long time subordinate to the assumption
  that there would be a stronger stake in cultural homogeneity. But wider public debate
  developed with the accumulation of problems at the end of the 1990s and especially
  after the 2003 PISA Test produced disastrous results from German schoolchildren,
  particularly with regard to immigrant children (second as well as first-generation
  immigrants).34  Growing importance is attached in history teaching to the question
  whose history is relevant and who should â or should not â enjoy authority and agency
  in a historical perspective.35 All school curricula include the theme of other cultures.
  Even the most conservative states define tolerance and empathy towards ethnic or
  religious minorities, as well as human-rights education, as central educational
  goals. The Bavarian history curriculum, for example, declares,It is part of everyday
  life that pupils from completely different European and non-European countries learn
  and work together in a class, and it reflects a part of our life as a society. It
  is part of the educational and disciplinary task of the Realschule to use this situation
  to good educational effect, preparing pupils for a life in which people and cultures
  live together respecting human rights, supporting one another and tackling differences
  of opinion and conflicts in a peaceful manner.36 But how do curricula try to implement
  these goals? How should the perspectives of ethnic, religious or cultural minorities
  be represented and integrated into history education? Is it merely a question of
  tolerating the 'other', or is it rather a matter of respect, representation and
  ultimately of a citizenship education that addresses all children on an equal footing?It
  is difficult to give definitive answers to these questions. Some curricula focus
  on 'tolerance' and consider immigrants and other minorities largely as objects of
  study. Others ask teachers and textbook authors to shift perspectives and to see
  immigrants in the role of subjects.37  The marginalization of global perspectives
  proves to be disadvantageous in this respect. As 'the world' is now sitting in the
  classroom, it would make sense to integrate it further into history lessons, and
  to place greater importance on discussing concepts of self and 'other' in history
  and culture.In reality, however, curricula in more than half the German states,
  including Bremen, Hesse, Saxony, Thuringia, Saarland, Bavaria and Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg,
  tend to ignore the global as well as the postcolonial dimensions of history. Lower
  Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia deal with the topic quite admirably, but again
  mainly in the sixth form. So a large percentage of German pupils never have the
  opportunity to recognize [End Page 132]  changing perceptions and the conflicts
  surrounding them. The same is true of portrayals of the religious history of Europe,
  which is depicted with far less complexity and differentiation in curricula for
  the Realschule or, even more, for the Hauptschule than those for the Gymnasium.
  This is problematic in view of the fact that the student bodies of the Hauptschule
  are dramatically more diverse in terms of religion and ethnicity.38 How do the textbooks
  deal with questions that challenge the education system in all federal states? As
  a general rule, it can be said that all recent textbooks accept the increasing diversity
  of cultural patterns and the presence of immigrants in numerous facets of society
  as a productive challenge, and make efforts to dedicate more space in the textbooks
  to minority issues. Often, as with gender history, this is only achieved by adding
  new chapters â on such topics as the history of migration or the coexistence of
  minorities and majorities. Some new textbooks explicitly point out that Germany
  and Europe have always been characterized by migration, cultural contacts and the
  fact that different social, religious or ethnic groups have lived together, both
  amicably and with conflict.39  Generally, however, almost no history textbooks address
  shifts between minority and majority perspectives or tensions between perceptions
  of the self and the 'other' as a basis for understanding the whole or to show the
  fundamental role of cultural diversity and transfer, as well as the conflicts they
  involve over time.In the textbooks immigrants and other minorities somehow always
  remain the 'others'. They appear as either the victims or the culprits of unfortunate
  developments, always somehow 'a problem' for the majority.40  Furthermore, pictures
  of immigrants in almost all textbooks tend to equip them with features typically
  associated with 'otherness' â particular skin and hair colour or a certain type
  of clothing.41  The label of 'other' thus remains, and stereotypes are reinforced
  rather than dissolved. This does not exactly support the increased understanding
  of the 'other' envisaged by education bureaucrats.It is, however, extremely difficult
  to escape this interpretative trap. The challenge for authors of implementing an
  integrative concept is exemplified by the manner in which Jewish history is integrated
  â or perhaps we should say not integrated â into general or German history.42  The
  detailed study of the Shoah is now solidly established as a horrific chapter of
  German history; and Holocaust education has long served in all German schools as
  an important instrument of general human-rights education and of teaching pupils
  to think beyond national perspectives.This is without a doubt a welcome development.
  It does, however, still make it difficult for curriculum and textbook authors to
  convey Jewish history as 'beyond tragedy' and detached from the perspective of the
  victims. The space allocated to aspects of Jewish history in German textbooks has
  dramatically increased since the mid 1990s. Textbooks have also been making efforts
  to work with multiple perspectives in the chapters on [End Page 133]  National Socialism,
  and to give a voice to the persecuted, the humiliated and the resistance alongside
  the sources from the perpetrators, which still tend to dominate. The processes of
  integration and assimilation remain for the most part unknown to the pupils, with
  the result that a centuries-long history of a complex relationship that was rich
  in tension, yet at the same time extremely fruitful, is frequently reduced to one
  of persecution and discrimination. Either Jewish history is dealt with in special
  chapters, thus encouraging a sense of 'otherness'; or the Jews are contrasted with
  the majority and presented primarily in the role of victims. These depictions distort
  not only the pupils' view of Jewish aspects of German national history, but also
  their understanding of significant inner-Jewish developments such as the Haskalah,
  the Jewish Enlightenment. The consequence is obvious: Jews seldom appear as active
  players, and this encourages the impression that historical agency was enjoyed only
  by the (non-Jewish) majority, shifting the minority further into a subaltern status.43
  \ The fact that hardly any textbooks mention the refounding of Jewish communities
  in postwar Germany serves to support this impression. The message, if unintentional,
  is that Jews have only a tragic history in Germany. Their present and future are
  barely touched upon.The case is somewhat different for representations of Muslims,
  no doubt because of their present situation in Germany. Muslims figure in textbooks
  with particular frequency in chapters dealing with the crusades and violent advances
  of Islam towards Europe. The hidden messages â including those conveyed in illustrations
  â are often problematic, both for the past and the present. Muslims appear either
  as immigrants who have problems or cause them, or as terrorists.44  Textbook readers
  almost never encounter Muslims who have been living in Europe as Europeans for centuries,
  for instance in the Balkans or in Russian Tatarstan. It is especially problematic
  here that Islam is either discussed largely in the context of global security issues
  or depicted as a purely religious phenomenon, and then in an essentialist, idealized
  form (Christianity, on the other hand, is depicted historically). Although Islam
  has been a component of European history for centuries, it is portrayed in most
  textbooks as an 'other' that is somehow foreign and 'oriental'.Nevertheless a linear
  analysis of the Islam narrative in German textbooks does reveal some changes, such
  as the now frequent portrayal of the crusades as a history shared by different cultures,
  and not just a military encounter. Additionally, some textbooks make efforts to
  give a voice to both sides and to provide pupils with opportunities to learn about
  the different points of view and reach their own judgements. As Gerdien Jonker has
  pointed out, 'In this narrative, German identity is no longer the issue. It has
  been replaced by a search for Europe's status in world society.'45 This turn towards
  a European perspective, albeit via harmonized and affirmational tendencies, certainly
  brings new opportunities. On the one hand, European history has always enjoyed a
  certain plurality (and, in the [End Page 134]  Balkans, a Muslim majority), despite
  the dominance of Christianity. Europe is thus confronted with diversity and has
  to deal with it; a European identity free of openness towards 'others' and 'outsiders'
  is unthinkable. On the other hand, the Europeanization of minority histories can
  place historic phenomena such as emancipation and anti-semitism into a larger context,
  thus helping to historicize them.46  At the same time, however, it appears that
  the non-Christian minorities have become the 'victims' of a stronger focus on Europe
  and its history: the more defined the search for common European traditions, the
  stronger the focus on 'legitimating' Europe in its roots in Latin Christianity and
  the religious Enlightenment, and with this the secularization of the state.47 Up
  until now, and unlike in the USA, hardly any powerful lobby for adequate representation
  of minorities has existed in Germany. In this regard, the practice of merely 'mentioning'
  minorities, and thereby confirming their powerlessness, is as rare in Germany as
  the structural broadening of textbook contents that it would entail.48  The number
  of pages in German history textbooks has remained relatively constant for years
  â about 300 pages for years nine and ten. This means that in Germany â unlike in
  the USA, where pupils are confronted with books of a thousand pages, because each
  social group demands adequate representation in textbooks and possesses the power
  to get it â the incorporation of new aspects must be 'bought' at the cost of other
  aspects.German curricula and textbooks have adopted new specialist historical and
  didactic concepts in a wide variety of ways. Due to the federal structure of the
  education system and to the existence of different school types, the conceptions
  of historical knowledge and the main aims of history teaching vary significantly
  from state to state and also from one school type to another, as this essay has
  aimed to show. All curricula need updating in some aspects: this is recognized both
  in education policy and also by textbook authors and publishers, and most curricula
  and textbooks demonstrate that attempts are being made to keep up to date and to
  adopt at least main ideas of modern historical scholarship and pedagogy.As a general
  rule, the textbooks try hard to address current affairs and developments. Almost
  all textbooks published in the last few years refer to the events of 11 September
  2001, or to the contradictory process of globalization.49  Equally, the majority
  of history textbooks now deal with aspects of social, everyday and cultural history
  alongside the classical approaches of political history and high culture, to a far
  greater extent than in the 1970s and 1980s. But international or transnational perspectives
  are generally restricted to the history of politics, diplomacy and events. For reasons
  related to approval systems, politics and the market economy, the underlying tendency
  of German textbooks remains conservative in many respects. They are nevertheless
  open to new concepts, even in matters of design. [End Page 135]  The modern textbook
  may not offer everything the pupil's heart might desire in terms of visual layout
  and graphics, yet the general portrayal, the scholarship and the pedagogical and
  educational concepts are pupil-focused and receptive to new ideas. Almost all history
  books do offer practical advice on historical work, and most textbooks, especially
  those for Gymnasium and Realschule, follow the concept of a workbook, albeit with
  varying consistency. They always include specific chapters on multiple perspectives
  and methods of historical thinking, offering a history based on interpretation with
  the textbook as a source. Most German textbooks, especially those for Gymnasium,
  try to meet the important didactic criteria of multi-perspectivity, recognition
  of conflicting opinions and training in the ability to deconstruct narratives or
  historical myths. But whether this will now change as a result of the move towards
  a more test-oriented educational system remains to be seen.Simone LÃ¤ssig completed

  Ethos, Innsbruck, 2001.26.Â The guidelines for Bremen state, for instance, that 'the
  history of gender relations has filled the important historical dimension it deserves
  thanks to research on women's history': Rahmenplan Sek. II, Gymnasiale Oberstufe,
  approved 2000, p. 16. They also (p. 24) identify numerous topics for year thirteen
  dealing with gender history in schools.27.Â The Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg curricula are apparently
  not aware of this problem, for the issue is hardly mentioned at all: Bildungsplan
  Gymnasium, Geschichte, 2004. This is also the case for the sixth form. The Realschule
  syllabus, however, includes 'the role of the woman and the family' (p. 108).28.Â In
  the new edition of Tempora 2 in 2004, for example, the publisher notes that the
  edition has been 'extended to include a chapter on gender history'. Women, it explains
  'must' now evidently be featured in the textbook, so a chapter was simply 'attached'.
  This process is reflected by the manner in which the book deals with the issue.
  It is conceived purely as 'women's history', and ultimately merely attached to 'real
  history'. As a result, 'women' tend to be marginalized.29.Â In the U.S., this phenomenon
  is known and labelled as 'mentioning'; a phenomenon that is most relevant in the
  context of the representation of minority and other 'silent' groups. Michael W.

  for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a triennial worldwide test of 15-year-old
  schoolchildren's scholastic performance, the implementation of which is co-ordinated
  by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).35.Â Staat â

  and Historical Scholarship in Germany\n\nSimone LÃ¤ssig  (bio) and Karl Heinrich
  Pohl  (bio)\n\n\n\nEver since the introduction of compulsory school attendance for
  all children, school textbooks have enjoyed considerable significance as instruments
  of socialization, particularly in the eyes of the state. Although we still know
  little about the ways in which the contents of textbooks are processed and learned,
  as a medium they undoubtedly influence many people during a phase of the life-cycle
  which often helps to shape their ideas for the rest of their lives. 'Textbook knowledge'
  is something that is seen to be the result of social discourse and thus a reflection
  of the Zeitgeist â and for that reason it is bound to be of interest to historians.1
  \ Textbooks in subjects such as history or civics, which are likely to inspire concepts
  of identity and provide general social orientation, are of particular political
  significance, as debates throughout the world have shown. Thus the social and cultural
  knowledge found in textbooks not only reflects scholarly requirements and contemporary
  didactic codes: it is always of political relevance too, as this essay will show.\nIn
  this article we examine how current social challenges that have changed and continue
  to change academic approaches to history have also influenced the concepts and contents
  of history textbooks in Germany. The article derives from an ongoing project of
  research into the relationship between history tuition in schools and new tendencies
  in historical scholarship: the latter include regional, transnational and global
  approaches; an interest in the mutual perceptions of Europeans and non-Europeans
  and of majority and minority groups; interest in 'entangled histories' or histoires
  croisÃ©es; and a gradually growing sensitivity to post-colonial interpretations.
  The rest of this article will examine some of the ways in which these new approaches
  have entered â or failed to enter â school history textbooks in the German education
  system.\nThe German Education and Textbook System\n'The German education system'
  is something of a misnomer. Although there is a basic national framework of compulsory
  coeducational schooling, for the most part state-run and free of charge,2  German
  education policy is controlled by sixteen separate federal states, each with its
  own ministry of education and its own curricula and standards.3  As a result, the
  many different curricula and textbooks do not only reflect new scholarly research.
  Beyond this, they also give voice to the opinions that are politically and culturally
  dominant in each German state and its public sphere. [End Page 125]  From a legal
  point of view, the power of definition is in the hands of the state governments;
  nevertheless, politicians, scholars and journalists as well as 'stakeholders' such
  as teachers' and parents' associations also participate in the discourse and the
  negotiations about what may or may not count and be canonically defined as approved
  knowledge, accepted values and popular memory.\nAll German states follow a highly
  competitive and selective 'streaming' process that separates the more from the less
  academically gifted pupils at as young an age as ten.4  Those seen as less academically
  gifted are usually sent to the so-called Hauptschule, from which they will generally
  be expected to enter an apprenticeship in a manual trade. The middle stream is sent
  to the Realschule, from which they will hope to enter an apprenticeship in commerce
  or healthcare; a very few may attend college or university later. Pupils with the
  most academic promise â roughly thirty percent â may enrol at the Gymnasium, where
  they will be prepared for university entrance or a more prestigious apprenticeship,
  completing their schooling after twelve or thirteen years with the Abitur examination
  (equivalent to UK A-levels).5  For each type of school, the state governments compile
  specific curricula and approve textbooks from which schools may make their selections.\nAs
  a result of this system, there is a wide range of history textbooks to choose from,
  with a wealth of different didactic perspectives and contents. All state schools
  require a chronological approach to history, with coverage from the Stone Age until
  the present,6  and following the unification of Germany in 1989â90 many states revised
  their curricula to give more emphasis to the period after 1945.7  Approaches that
  go beyond chronology are usually only available to Gymnasium pupils at sixth-form
  level. Some states â Saxony or Bremen, for example â offer special topics at this
  level, such as 'Peace in the Twentieth Century' or 'History, Culture and Identity
  Construction', or longitudinal topics such as 'Gender History' or 'The Role of China'.
  But 'World History' courses are generally not offered, and in this German curricula
  and textbooks are clearly different from their Anglo Saxon counterparts.\nA peculiarity
  of the German system is that all German schoolteachers undergo an academic, research-oriented
  education. As a result, the gap between historical scholarship and the school is
  relatively narrow and the ability of German teachers to recognize new trends at
  an early stage is comparatively high. In principle, then, curricula should be able
  to reflect the latest trends in historical scholarship. On the other hand, teachers
  at the Hauptschule undergo a shorter training and are quite often required to teach
  subjects for which they were not academically trained. In such environments, textbooks
  gain a special importance and status.\nProvisional Results of Our Analysis\nThese
  characteristics of the German educational system already make it difficult to provide
  an overview of the aims and contents of history [End Page 126]  curricula, on top
  of which there is also the wide range of textbooks to consider: nearly 150 textbooks
  are currently in use in contemporary history alone. We have restricted ourselves
  to a representative sample of some twenty of these, and will present here an overview
  and analysis of the most recent tendencies.\nTranscending the National Perspectives\nThe
  current history guidelines for all school types in all German states clearly attach
  much more importance to 'Europe', and particularly to the political process of European
  integration, than they did in the 1970s and 1980s.8  Nevertheless, there are considerable
  differences between concepts, areas of focus and didactic goals. For the most part,
  it is possible to identify partially conflicting approaches. On the one hand, the
  curricula of several states draw attention to the obstacles and difficulties of
  European integration, however well-meant the political intentions. The sixth-form
  curriculum in Lower Saxony, for instance, adheres quite closely to the current consensus
  of research, with European integration appearing as a positive goal but at the same
  time as laden with problems, which pupils are expected to discuss.9  Thus pupils
  can learn that history is constituted by many different perspectives, and the formation
  of a 'European idea' in both European and non-European contexts can be directly
  addressed.\nBut in other states curricula follow an approach that is almost the
  polar opposite. Here the idea of modern Europe is taken as a norm simply to be legitimated
  by history teaching. In the Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg guidelines, for example, history lessons
  are supposed to foster the 'development of a European identity'.10  This identity
  is almost uncritically assumed to be desirable and primarily a reflection of a 'cultural
  unity' of Europe, which â implicitly â is to be deduced from a common history built
  around Latin Christianity, Roman law and order, the Enlightenment and democracy.
  At no point do these curricula reflect the exclusionary implications of this approach
  (for many migrants or for Muslims who have been living in the Balkans for centuries,
  for instance), nor do they discuss the bias inherent in a concept of Europe defined
  explicitly in cultural or political terms. European history here seems to be largely
  identified with the history of the political institutions of the EU, and even if
  cultural aspects are addressed, this is mainly to support a teleological history
  of the EU. Diversity is verbally praised, yet â if we analyse underlying concepts
  and assumptions â in itself is hardly accepted as a European value or even a positive
  challenge.11  This kind of uncritical concept of history does not lend itself to
  the development of skills pertaining to critique of ideology or deconstruction of
  historical narratives.12  The 'European history' constructed here is astonishingly
  similar to the classical templates for national histories in the nineteenth century,
  except that, in this case, legitimacy relates to a different, supranational level.
  [End Page 127] \nAlmost all curricula adopt clear European references and, to a
  certain extent, see German national history as part of European history. Yet the
  European perspective is not quite as prominent in the textbooks as one might expect
  from these curricula. Although they include the most important political periods
  and events, such as the French Revolution of 1789, and place selected episodes of
  German history, such as the 1848â9 revolution or the evolution of National Socialism,
  into a European context, Europe is only sporadically discussed, usually only in
  terms of its political history and with a bias toward western and central Europe.
  For the period from the eighteenth to the twentieth century (the time-frame on which
  our analysis focuses), the primary object of interest is the implementation of the
  'European Project' after 1945, despite the fact that this period is also frequently
  dealt with in detail by social studies and geography textbooks. And because the
  dominant viewpoint is focused on 'progress' towards this project, it only rarely
  includes alternative options and contradictory developments or portrays Europe as
  an area of competing as well as converging memories. The Franco-German history book,
  published in 2006 for sixth-form level and approved for use in all German states,
  is one of the few exceptions in that it attempts to highlight different memories
  of the same event and to discuss the reasons for these.13 \nTextbooks rarely present
  Europe and its boundaries as historically changeable and negotiated constructs and
  self-images, which also mirror representations of Europe in the non-European world.14
  \ The textbook Tempora vol. 2, for example, focuses on the European issue in a chapter
  promisingly entitled 'Regional Integration under the Influence of Hegemonic Zones'.15
  \ Here, however, as in many other textbooks, the concern is primarily with the political
  development of Western Europe up to the present and in the context of general postwar
  history. Both the meaning and definition of Europe over time, and a transnational
  or a (pan-)European perspective on history-writing and analysis, remain for the
  most part unexplored. The dominant teleological and positive concept of 'Europe'
  again becomes obvious when Poland's membership of the European Union is presented
  in another textbook as simply a 'return' to Europe, rather than possibly an 'expansion'
  of Europe.16  Here textbook authors lose the opportunity to discuss divergent interpretations
  and to encourage pupils' capacity to identify and critique master narratives. Even
  when German history textbooks cite or quote from specialist works, these are too
  often presented as facts rather than as interpretations, and differing viewpoints
  are not juxtaposed.17 \nIn relation to national narratives and traditional representations
  of national identity, on the other hand, the verdict on the textbooks can be more
  positive. Almost all the textbooks we examined take a critical distance on German
  history, avoiding national myths or alternatively giving the pupils the tools with
  which to deconstruct them.18  Sustained by an almost pacifistic and deliberately
  unpatriotic undertone, German textbooks attempt [End Page 128]  to define clearly
  the difference between historical burdens and trustworthiness in the present. This
  basic tendency essentially results from a national history that has been repeatedly
  obliged to confront the barbarism of National Socialism and the Holocaust. The term
  'nation' is therefore seldom used with a positive connotation, and even in the more
  conservative states is frequently associated with the dangers of nationalism. Even
  the 'event of the [twentieth] century', German reunification, is for the most part
  portrayed in a restrained manner and mostly free of patriotism.19  In the books'
  underlying assumptions, we rarely encounter concepts of 'the enemy' or sharply defined
  strategies of exclusion, but rather a system of values consistent with principles
  formulated by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe,
  thus oriented towards human rights, democracy and peace.20 \nHowever, none of this
  means that history is derived or recounted from transnational perspectives. In this
  respect, the findings of our analysis differ from those of Yasemin Soysal, who recently
  argued that German textbooks were virtually allowing the concept of the nation to
  disappear, and instead focusing on a globalizing and diversifying world.21  We concur
  with her impression that German textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions
  and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centred on democracy, progress,
  human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness, and she is equally correct in her
  view that Germany is treated as a part of Europe. Yet attempts to treat national,
  European and global approaches as real equivalents are rare. More often the world
  and Europe are considered primarily from a German perspective; only a handful of
  texts deal with European or even non-European developments in their own right.22
  \ Unlike recent social studies textbooks, most history textbooks still fail to embed
  national history into a global approach; at best, it becomes part of a 'Western-civilization'
  framework.23  And even this framework loses importance the closer the books come
  to the present day. While books that cover the period from the Stone Age up to the
  Renaissance or the Enlightenment follow a broader regional view, the history of
  the nineteenth and twentieth centuries â except in the sections on imperialism and
  the Cold War â is clearly written from the perspective of German history. They thus
  underestimate the impact of transnational processes, of transcultural interaction
  and transregional transfers of ideas, goods and people, including in relation to
  European integration.24  Given that there are no specialist lessons on 'world history'
  in Germany, while by contrast classrooms are subject to the effects of globalization
  and a multinational student body, this is a significant defect.25 \nGender History\nThe
  importance of gender roles and gender concepts is widely accepted by scholars as
  a fundamental dimension of history, and in principle it is also approved by most
  German school curricula. This surprisingly positive [End Page 129]  finding is limited,
  however, by the fact that in most cases this perspective is not developed intensively
  until sixth-form level and is therefore not encountered in any depth by at least
  two-thirds of German pupils. Nevertheless, in some German states, such as North
  Rhine-Westphalia or Bremen, school bureaucracy has established a much more open
  attitude towards 'gender' in history (and not just women's history) than prevailed
  a generation ago.26  Other states, however, show considerable gaps here, and gender
  history is often reduced to 'women's history', which in turn is limited to a small
  number of topics such as the Industrial Revolution or the emancipation of women.27
  \nOnce again, the textbooks do not make full use of the opportunities offered by
  the curricula to integrate the findings of recent historical scholarship. They hardly
  ever address gender as a historical category or even employ it as an analytical
  instrument. Still, textbooks are not the only (and perhaps not even the primary)
  targets for this criticism: a wealth of academic works can also be considered guilty
  of the same neglect.\nThis verdict can be modified somewhat if we consider the impact
  of the increasing quantity of 'women's history' produced over the past two decades,
  which can hardly be ignored by any contemporary textbook. Most textbooks offer a
  narrative (often somewhat moralizing) of the liberation of women and a thorough
  and critical analysis of the process. The 'Path of Women towards Equality' is usually
  pursued through many historical events, though sometimes taken out of its historical
  context (and in some cases it is obvious that the publisher has merely added some
  paragraphs or chapters on women without any change to the books' overall approach).28
  \ This is a significant example of authors' recognition of their obligation to reflect
  and obey the Zeitgeist.29  Yet the conclusion remains that German textbooks have
  only rarely digested the concepts of modern gender history. They remain focused
  on women's emancipation, which in most textbooks is seen as a concept successfully
  developed in the West and closely related to democracy â and this underlying assumption
  is not disclosed or discussed.\nPostcolonial Studies\nSince the 1980s the history
  profession has increasingly opened up to postcolonial theories, especially in the
  Anglo-Saxon world. The various violent or non-violent forms assumed by power, hegemony
  and cultural contact between the 'West' and the 'rest' were at the centre of this
  interest, together with the question of how colonialism affected the colonized peoples
  and the self-image of Europe and the Europeans. In examining how the teaching of
  history has been influenced by these new approaches and interests, we should bear
  in mind that colonialism as well as decolonization has not been as important an
  issue for Germany as for Belgium, Great Britain or France, for instance. Furthermore,
  research approaches in this field are still relatively new in Germany, having only
  begun in the mid 1990s, and they have yet to make their mark on scholarly discourse.30
  \ In the light of this and [End Page 130]  of the long delay between the emergence
  of new scholarship and its wider dissemination, our expectations of curricula and
  textbooks must not be placed too high. Although most of the curricula we analysed
  include the topics of 'Colonialism' and 'Decolonization', the shifts of perspective
  necessary for postcolonial approaches are incorporated into curricula and guidelines
  in only a few German states, and even then mostly limited to sixth-form level.\nThe
  extreme differences among the curricula are especially striking at sixth-form level.
  Here we find almost every variation, from ignoring the topic altogether to discussing
  the issue in a fashion that at times comes close to scholarly approaches. Some states,
  such as Lower Saxony,31  demonstrate a considerable willingness to experiment (as
  with the topic of gender history) and welcome this issue with interest; other states,
  particularly Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg and Bavaria,32  are diffident about postcolonial
  approaches; and some completely ignore them.\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that
  the results of the textbook analysis were fairly uniform and disappointing. Nearly
  all textbooks need to be updated, with a few exceptions. To be sure, imperialism
  and colonialism â if they are mentioned at all â are not depicted primarily as 'civilizing
  missions' but rather as a history of violence and exploitation, inequality and disregard
  for native cultures. Tempora 2, for instance, dedicates an entire section to the
  topic 'North and South â Inequality in the World' (pp. 459â87). Yet a critical postcolonial
  perspective on modernization seldom figures: instead, an almost uncritical image
  of the Western path to modernity underlies the portrayal (p. 463).33 \nMoreover,
  primary sources from the pen of the ruling forces tend to dominate; the colonized
  remain for the most part without a voice, and sometimes are not even visible. This
  reinforces the one-way transfer of knowledge to the pupils. In most German textbooks
  there is little trace of an 'entangled' history, in which pupils can learn how different
  cultures and societies have shared a wealth of experiences, both positive and negative,
  and in which they can be sensitized to processes of interaction and interdependence
  between Europe and the world regions (previously) colonized by Europeans.\nOnly
  a few textbooks make it clear that one culture has conquered, reshaped, altered
  and destroyed another in order to rule, or that other forms of colonization, even
  if primarily non-violent, are still in effect even today â for instance, via language
  or academic cultures. Some imbalances, such as the economic legacies of European
  colonial policies, are mentioned with increasing regularity. However, more reflective
  questions as to how the self and the 'other' are construed are extremely rare. Similarly,
  the many Eurocentric interpretations that pupils still encounter in their daily
  lives are barely subjected to debate. European history may have achieved a higher
  standing than national history alone, yet it has not been truly extended into a
  world history or written from an external perspective. [End Page 131] \nRepresentations
  of Minorities\nIt was only quite recently, by comparison with many of its European
  neighbours, that Germany accepted its status as a country of immigration, which
  is almost certainly due to its low level of post-colonial migration. The issue of
  'migration and education' was for a long time subordinate to the assumption that
  there would be a stronger stake in cultural homogeneity. But wider public debate
  developed with the accumulation of problems at the end of the 1990s and especially
  after the 2003 PISA Test produced disastrous results from German schoolchildren,
  particularly with regard to immigrant children (second as well as first-generation
  immigrants).34  Growing importance is attached in history teaching to the question
  whose history is relevant and who should â or should not â enjoy authority and agency
  in a historical perspective.35 \nAll school curricula include the theme of other
  cultures. Even the most conservative states define tolerance and empathy towards
  ethnic or religious minorities, as well as human-rights education, as central educational
  goals. The Bavarian history curriculum, for example, declares,\nIt is part of everyday
  life that pupils from completely different European and non-European countries learn
  and work together in a class, and it reflects a part of our life as a society. It
  is part of the educational and disciplinary task of the Realschule to use this situation
  to good educational effect, preparing pupils for a life in which people and cultures
  live together respecting human rights, supporting one another and tackling differences
  of opinion and conflicts in a peaceful manner.36 \nBut how do curricula try to implement
  these goals? How should the perspectives of ethnic, religious or cultural minorities
  be represented and integrated into history education? Is it merely a question of
  tolerating the 'other', or is it rather a matter of respect, representation and
  ultimately of a citizenship education that addresses all children on an equal footing?\nIt
  is difficult to give definitive answers to these questions. Some curricula focus
  on 'tolerance' and consider immigrants and other minorities largely as objects of
  study. Others ask teachers and textbook authors to shift perspectives and to see
  immigrants in the role of subjects.37  The marginalization of global perspectives
  proves to be disadvantageous in this respect. As 'the world' is now sitting in the
  classroom, it would make sense to integrate it further into history lessons, and
  to place greater importance on discussing concepts of self and 'other' in history
  and culture.\nIn reality, however, curricula in more than half the German states,
  including Bremen, Hesse, Saxony, Thuringia, Saarland, Bavaria and Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg,
  tend to ignore the global as well as the postcolonial dimensions of history. Lower
  Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia deal with the topic quite admirably, but again
  mainly in the sixth form. So a large percentage of German pupils never have the
  opportunity to recognize [End Page 132]  changing perceptions and the conflicts
  surrounding them. The same is true of portrayals of the religious history of Europe,
  which is depicted with far less complexity and differentiation in curricula for
  the Realschule or, even more, for the Hauptschule than those for the Gymnasium.
  This is problematic in view of the fact that the student bodies of the Hauptschule
  are dramatically more diverse in terms of religion and ethnicity.38 \nHow do the
  textbooks deal with questions that challenge the education system in all federal
  states? As a general rule, it can be said that all recent textbooks accept the increasing
  diversity of cultural patterns and the presence of immigrants in numerous facets
  of society as a productive challenge, and make efforts to dedicate more space in
  the textbooks to minority issues. Often, as with gender history, this is only achieved
  by adding new chapters â on such topics as the history of migration or the coexistence
  of minorities and majorities. Some new textbooks explicitly point out that Germany
  and Europe have always been characterized by migration, cultural contacts and the
  fact that different social, religious or ethnic groups have lived together, both
  amicably and with conflict.39  Generally, however, almost no history textbooks address
  shifts between minority and majority perspectives or tensions between perceptions
  of the self and the 'other' as a basis for understanding the whole or to show the
  fundamental role of cultural diversity and transfer, as well as the conflicts they
  involve over time.\nIn the textbooks immigrants and other minorities somehow always
  remain the 'others'. They appear as either the victims or the culprits of unfortunate
  developments, always somehow 'a problem' for the majority.40  Furthermore, pictures
  of immigrants in almost all textbooks tend to equip them with features typically
  associated with 'otherness' â particular skin and hair colour or a certain type
  of clothing.41  The label of 'other' thus remains, and stereotypes are reinforced
  rather than dissolved. This does not exactly support the increased understanding
  of the 'other' envisaged by education bureaucrats.\nIt is, however, extremely difficult
  to escape this interpretative trap. The challenge for authors of implementing an
  integrative concept is exemplified by the manner in which Jewish history is integrated
  â or perhaps we should say not integrated â into general or German history.42  The
  detailed study of the Shoah is now solidly established as a horrific chapter of
  German history; and Holocaust education has long served in all German schools as
  an important instrument of general human-rights education and of teaching pupils
  to think beyond national perspectives.\nThis is without a doubt a welcome development.
  It does, however, still make it difficult for curriculum and textbook authors to
  convey Jewish history as 'beyond tragedy' and detached from the perspective of the
  victims. The space allocated to aspects of Jewish history in German textbooks has
  dramatically increased since the mid 1990s. Textbooks have also been making efforts
  to work with multiple perspectives in the chapters on [End Page 133]  National Socialism,
  and to give a voice to the persecuted, the humiliated and the resistance alongside
  the sources from the perpetrators, which still tend to dominate. The processes of
  integration and assimilation remain for the most part unknown to the pupils, with
  the result that a centuries-long history of a complex relationship that was rich
  in tension, yet at the same time extremely fruitful, is frequently reduced to one
  of persecution and discrimination. Either Jewish history is dealt with in special
  chapters, thus encouraging a sense of 'otherness'; or the Jews are contrasted with
  the majority and presented primarily in the role of victims. These depictions distort
  not only the pupils' view of Jewish aspects of German national history, but also
  their understanding of significant inner-Jewish developments such as the Haskalah,
  the Jewish Enlightenment. The consequence is obvious: Jews seldom appear as active
  players, and this encourages the impression that historical agency was enjoyed only
  by the (non-Jewish) majority, shifting the minority further into a subaltern status.43
  \ The fact that hardly any textbooks mention the refounding of Jewish communities
  in postwar Germany serves to support this impression. The message, if unintentional,
  is that Jews have only a tragic history in Germany. Their present and future are
  barely touched upon.\nThe case is somewhat different for representations of Muslims,
  no doubt because of their present situation in Germany. Muslims figure in textbooks
  with particular frequency in chapters dealing with the crusades and violent advances
  of Islam towards Europe. The hidden messages â including those conveyed in illustrations
  â are often problematic, both for the past and the present. Muslims appear either
  as immigrants who have problems or cause them, or as terrorists.44  Textbook readers
  almost never encounter Muslims who have been living in Europe as Europeans for centuries,
  for instance in the Balkans or in Russian Tatarstan. It is especially problematic
  here that Islam is either discussed largely in the context of global security issues
  or depicted as a purely religious phenomenon, and then in an essentialist, idealized
  form (Christianity, on the other hand, is depicted historically). Although Islam
  has been a component of European history for centuries, it is portrayed in most
  textbooks as an 'other' that is somehow foreign and 'oriental'.\nNevertheless a
  linear analysis of the Islam narrative in German textbooks does reveal some changes,
  such as the now frequent portrayal of the crusades as a history shared by different
  cultures, and not just a military encounter. Additionally, some textbooks make efforts
  to give a voice to both sides and to provide pupils with opportunities to learn
  about the different points of view and reach their own judgements. As Gerdien Jonker
  has pointed out, 'In this narrative, German identity is no longer the issue. It
  has been replaced by a search for Europe's status in world society.'45 \nThis turn
  towards a European perspective, albeit via harmonized and affirmational tendencies,
  certainly brings new opportunities. On the one hand, European history has always
  enjoyed a certain plurality (and, in the [End Page 134]  Balkans, a Muslim majority),
  despite the dominance of Christianity. Europe is thus confronted with diversity
  and has to deal with it; a European identity free of openness towards 'others' and
  'outsiders' is unthinkable. On the other hand, the Europeanization of minority histories
  can place historic phenomena such as emancipation and anti-semitism into a larger
  context, thus helping to historicize them.46  At the same time, however, it appears
  that the non-Christian minorities have become the 'victims' of a stronger focus
  on Europe and its history: the more defined the search for common European traditions,
  the stronger the focus on 'legitimating' Europe in its roots in Latin Christianity
  and the religious Enlightenment, and with this the secularization of the state.47
  \nUp until now, and unlike in the USA, hardly any powerful lobby for adequate representation
  of minorities has existed in Germany. In this regard, the practice of merely 'mentioning'
  minorities, and thereby confirming their powerlessness, is as rare in Germany as
  the structural broadening of textbook contents that it would entail.48  The number
  of pages in German history textbooks has remained relatively constant for years
  â about 300 pages for years nine and ten. This means that in Germany â unlike in
  the USA, where pupils are confronted with books of a thousand pages, because each
  social group demands adequate representation in textbooks and possesses the power
  to get it â the incorporation of new aspects must be 'bought' at the cost of other
  aspects.\nConclusion\nGerman curricula and textbooks have adopted new specialist
  historical and didactic concepts in a wide variety of ways. Due to the federal structure
  of the education system and to the existence of different school types, the conceptions
  of historical knowledge and the main aims of history teaching vary significantly
  from state to state and also from one school type to another, as this essay has
  aimed to show. All curricula need updating in some aspects: this is recognized both
  in education policy and also by textbook authors and publishers, and most curricula
  and textbooks demonstrate that attempts are being made to keep up to date and to
  adopt at least main ideas of modern historical scholarship and pedagogy.\nAs a general
  rule, the textbooks try hard to address current affairs and developments. Almost
  all textbooks published in the last few years refer to the events of 11 September
  2001, or to the contradictory process of globalization.49  Equally, the majority
  of history textbooks now deal with aspects of social, everyday and cultural history
  alongside the classical approaches of political history and high culture, to a far
  greater extent than in the 1970s and 1980s. But international or transnational perspectives
  are generally restricted to the history of politics, diplomacy and events. For reasons
  related to approval systems, politics and the market economy, the underlying tendency
  of German textbooks remains conservative in many respects. They are nevertheless
  open to new concepts, even in matters of design. [End Page 135]  The modern textbook
  may not offer everything the pupil's heart might desire in terms of visual layout
  and graphics, yet the general portrayal, the scholarship and the pedagogical and
  educational concepts are pupil-focused and receptive to new ideas. Almost all history
  books do offer practical advice on historical work, and most textbooks, especially
  those for Gymnasium and Realschule, follow the concept of a workbook, albeit with
  varying consistency. They always include specific chapters on multiple perspectives
  and methods of historical thinking, offering a history based on interpretation with
  the textbook as a source. Most German textbooks, especially those for Gymnasium,
  try to meet the important didactic criteria of multi-perspectivity, recognition
  of conflicting opinions and training in the ability to deconstruct narratives or
  historical myths. But whether this will now change as a result of the move towards
  a more test-oriented educational system remains to be seen.\n\n\n\nSimone LÃ¤ssigÂ Â Simone

  at all: Bildungsplan Gymnasium, Geschichte, 2004. This is also the case for the
  sixth form. The Realschule syllabus, however, includes 'the role of the woman and
  the family' (p. 108).\n28.Â In the new edition of Tempora 2 in 2004, for example,
  the publisher notes that the edition has been 'extended to include a chapter on
  gender history'. Women, it explains 'must' now evidently be featured in the textbook,
  so a chapter was simply 'attached'. This process is reflected by the manner in which
  the book deals with the issue. It is conceived purely as 'women's history', and
  ultimately merely attached to 'real history'. As a result, 'women' tend to be marginalized.\n29.Â In

  school attendance for all children, school textbooks have enjoyed considerable significance
  as instruments of socialization, particularly in the eyes of the state. Although
  we still know little about the ways in which the contents of textbooks are processed
  and learned, as a medium they undoubtedly influence many people during a phase of
  the life-cycle which often helps to shape their ideas for the rest of their lives.
  'Textbook knowledge' is something that is seen to be the result of social discourse
  and thus a reflection of the Zeitgeist â and for that reason it is bound to be of
  interest to historians.1  Textbooks in subjects such as history or civics, which
  are likely to inspire concepts of identity and provide general social orientation,
  are of particular political significance, as debates throughout the world have shown.
  Thus the social and cultural knowledge found in textbooks not only reflects scholarly
  requirements and contemporary didactic codes: it is always of political relevance
  too, as this essay will show.In this article we examine how current social challenges
  that have changed and continue to change academic approaches to history have also
  influenced the concepts and contents of history textbooks in Germany. The article
  derives from an ongoing project of research into the relationship between history
  tuition in schools and new tendencies in historical scholarship: the latter include
  regional, transnational and global approaches; an interest in the mutual perceptions
  of Europeans and non-Europeans and of majority and minority groups; interest in
  'entangled histories' or histoires croisÃ©es; and a gradually growing sensitivity
  to post-colonial interpretations. The rest of this article will examine some of
  the ways in which these new approaches have entered â or failed to enter â school
  history textbooks in the German education system.'The German education system' is
  something of a misnomer. Although there is a basic national framework of compulsory
  coeducational schooling, for the most part state-run and free of charge,2  German
  education policy is controlled by sixteen separate federal states, each with its
  own ministry of education and its own curricula and standards.3  As a result, the
  many different curricula and textbooks do not only reflect new scholarly research.
  Beyond this, they also give voice to the opinions that are politically and culturally
  dominant in each German state and its public sphere. [End Page 125]  From a legal
  point of view, the power of definition is in the hands of the state governments;
  nevertheless, politicians, scholars and journalists as well as 'stakeholders' such
  as teachers' and parents' associations also participate in the discourse and the
  negotiations about what may or may not count and be canonically defined as approved
  knowledge, accepted values and popular memory.All German states follow a highly
  competitive and selective 'streaming' process that separates the more from the less
  academically gifted pupils at as young an age as ten.4  Those seen as less academically
  gifted are usually sent to the so-called Hauptschule, from which they will generally
  be expected to enter an apprenticeship in a manual trade. The middle stream is sent
  to the Realschule, from which they will hope to enter an apprenticeship in commerce
  or healthcare; a very few may attend college or university later. Pupils with the
  most academic promise â roughly thirty percent â may enrol at the Gymnasium, where
  they will be prepared for university entrance or a more prestigious apprenticeship,
  completing their schooling after twelve or thirteen years with the Abitur examination
  (equivalent to UK A-levels).5  For each type of school, the state governments compile
  specific curricula and approve textbooks from which schools may make their selections.As
  a result of this system, there is a wide range of history textbooks to choose from,
  with a wealth of different didactic perspectives and contents. All state schools
  require a chronological approach to history, with coverage from the Stone Age until
  the present,6  and following the unification of Germany in 1989â90 many states revised
  their curricula to give more emphasis to the period after 1945.7  Approaches that
  go beyond chronology are usually only available to Gymnasium pupils at sixth-form
  level. Some states â Saxony or Bremen, for example â offer special topics at this
  level, such as 'Peace in the Twentieth Century' or 'History, Culture and Identity
  Construction', or longitudinal topics such as 'Gender History' or 'The Role of China'.
  But 'World History' courses are generally not offered, and in this German curricula
  and textbooks are clearly different from their Anglo Saxon counterparts.A peculiarity
  of the German system is that all German schoolteachers undergo an academic, research-oriented
  education. As a result, the gap between historical scholarship and the school is
  relatively narrow and the ability of German teachers to recognize new trends at
  an early stage is comparatively high. In principle, then, curricula should be able
  to reflect the latest trends in historical scholarship. On the other hand, teachers
  at the Hauptschule undergo a shorter training and are quite often required to teach
  subjects for which they were not academically trained. In such environments, textbooks
  gain a special importance and status.These characteristics of the German educational
  system already make it difficult to provide an overview of the aims and contents
  of history [End Page 126]  curricula, on top of which there is also the wide range
  of textbooks to consider: nearly 150 textbooks are currently in use in contemporary
  history alone. We have restricted ourselves to a representative sample of some twenty
  of these, and will present here an overview and analysis of the most recent tendencies.The
  current history guidelines for all school types in all German states clearly attach
  much more importance to 'Europe', and particularly to the political process of European
  integration, than they did in the 1970s and 1980s.8  Nevertheless, there are considerable
  differences between concepts, areas of focus and didactic goals. For the most part,
  it is possible to identify partially conflicting approaches. On the one hand, the
  curricula of several states draw attention to the obstacles and difficulties of
  European integration, however well-meant the political intentions. The sixth-form
  curriculum in Lower Saxony, for instance, adheres quite closely to the current consensus
  of research, with European integration appearing as a positive goal but at the same
  time as laden with problems, which pupils are expected to discuss.9  Thus pupils
  can learn that history is constituted by many different perspectives, and the formation
  of a 'European idea' in both European and non-European contexts can be directly
  addressed.But in other states curricula follow an approach that is almost the polar
  opposite. Here the idea of modern Europe is taken as a norm simply to be legitimated
  by history teaching. In the Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg guidelines, for example, history lessons
  are supposed to foster the 'development of a European identity'.10  This identity
  is almost uncritically assumed to be desirable and primarily a reflection of a 'cultural
  unity' of Europe, which â implicitly â is to be deduced from a common history built
  around Latin Christianity, Roman law and order, the Enlightenment and democracy.
  At no point do these curricula reflect the exclusionary implications of this approach
  (for many migrants or for Muslims who have been living in the Balkans for centuries,
  for instance), nor do they discuss the bias inherent in a concept of Europe defined
  explicitly in cultural or political terms. European history here seems to be largely
  identified with the history of the political institutions of the EU, and even if
  cultural aspects are addressed, this is mainly to support a teleological history
  of the EU. Diversity is verbally praised, yet â if we analyse underlying concepts
  and assumptions â in itself is hardly accepted as a European value or even a positive
  challenge.11  This kind of uncritical concept of history does not lend itself to
  the development of skills pertaining to critique of ideology or deconstruction of
  historical narratives.12  The 'European history' constructed here is astonishingly
  similar to the classical templates for national histories in the nineteenth century,
  except that, in this case, legitimacy relates to a different, supranational level.
  [End Page 127] Almost all curricula adopt clear European references and, to a certain
  extent, see German national history as part of European history. Yet the European
  perspective is not quite as prominent in the textbooks as one might expect from
  these curricula. Although they include the most important political periods and
  events, such as the French Revolution of 1789, and place selected episodes of German
  history, such as the 1848â9 revolution or the evolution of National Socialism, into
  a European context, Europe is only sporadically discussed, usually only in terms
  of its political history and with a bias toward western and central Europe. For
  the period from the eighteenth to the twentieth century (the time-frame on which
  our analysis focuses), the primary object of interest is the implementation of the
  'European Project' after 1945, despite the fact that this period is also frequently
  dealt with in detail by social studies and geography textbooks. And because the
  dominant viewpoint is focused on 'progress' towards this project, it only rarely
  includes alternative options and contradictory developments or portrays Europe as
  an area of competing as well as converging memories. The Franco-German history book,
  published in 2006 for sixth-form level and approved for use in all German states,
  is one of the few exceptions in that it attempts to highlight different memories
  of the same event and to discuss the reasons for these.13 Textbooks rarely present
  Europe and its boundaries as historically changeable and negotiated constructs and
  self-images, which also mirror representations of Europe in the non-European world.14
  \ The textbook Tempora vol. 2, for example, focuses on the European issue in a chapter
  promisingly entitled 'Regional Integration under the Influence of Hegemonic Zones'.15
  \ Here, however, as in many other textbooks, the concern is primarily with the political
  development of Western Europe up to the present and in the context of general postwar
  history. Both the meaning and definition of Europe over time, and a transnational
  or a (pan-)European perspective on history-writing and analysis, remain for the
  most part unexplored. The dominant teleological and positive concept of 'Europe'
  again becomes obvious when Poland's membership of the European Union is presented
  in another textbook as simply a 'return' to Europe, rather than possibly an 'expansion'
  of Europe.16  Here textbook authors lose the opportunity to discuss divergent interpretations
  and to encourage pupils' capacity to identify and critique master narratives. Even
  when German history textbooks cite or quote from specialist works, these are too
  often presented as facts rather than as interpretations, and differing viewpoints
  are not juxtaposed.17 In relation to national narratives and traditional representations
  of national identity, on the other hand, the verdict on the textbooks can be more
  positive. Almost all the textbooks we examined take a critical distance on German
  history, avoiding national myths or alternatively giving the pupils the tools with
  which to deconstruct them.18  Sustained by an almost pacifistic and deliberately
  unpatriotic undertone, German textbooks attempt [End Page 128]  to define clearly
  the difference between historical burdens and trustworthiness in the present. This
  basic tendency essentially results from a national history that has been repeatedly
  obliged to confront the barbarism of National Socialism and the Holocaust. The term
  'nation' is therefore seldom used with a positive connotation, and even in the more
  conservative states is frequently associated with the dangers of nationalism. Even
  the 'event of the [twentieth] century', German reunification, is for the most part
  portrayed in a restrained manner and mostly free of patriotism.19  In the books'
  underlying assumptions, we rarely encounter concepts of 'the enemy' or sharply defined
  strategies of exclusion, but rather a system of values consistent with principles
  formulated by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe,
  thus oriented towards human rights, democracy and peace.20 However, none of this
  means that history is derived or recounted from transnational perspectives. In this
  respect, the findings of our analysis differ from those of Yasemin Soysal, who recently
  argued that German textbooks were virtually allowing the concept of the nation to
  disappear, and instead focusing on a globalizing and diversifying world.21  We concur
  with her impression that German textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions
  and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centred on democracy, progress,
  human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness, and she is equally correct in her
  view that Germany is treated as a part of Europe. Yet attempts to treat national,
  European and global approaches as real equivalents are rare. More often the world
  and Europe are considered primarily from a German perspective; only a handful of
  texts deal with European or even non-European developments in their own right.22
  \ Unlike recent social studies textbooks, most history textbooks still fail to embed
  national history into a global approach; at best, it becomes part of a 'Western-civilization'
  framework.23  And even this framework loses importance the closer the books come
  to the present day. While books that cover the period from the Stone Age up to the
  Renaissance or the Enlightenment follow a broader regional view, the history of
  the nineteenth and twentieth centuries â except in the sections on imperialism and
  the Cold War â is clearly written from the perspective of German history. They thus
  underestimate the impact of transnational processes, of transcultural interaction
  and transregional transfers of ideas, goods and people, including in relation to
  European integration.24  Given that there are no specialist lessons on 'world history'
  in Germany, while by contrast classrooms are subject to the effects of globalization
  and a multinational student body, this is a significant defect.25 The importance
  of gender roles and gender concepts is widely accepted by scholars as a fundamental
  dimension of history, and in principle it is also approved by most German school
  curricula. This surprisingly positive [End Page 129]  finding is limited, however,
  by the fact that in most cases this perspective is not developed intensively until
  sixth-form level and is therefore not encountered in any depth by at least two-thirds
  of German pupils. Nevertheless, in some German states, such as North Rhine-Westphalia
  or Bremen, school bureaucracy has established a much more open attitude towards
  'gender' in history (and not just women's history) than prevailed a generation ago.26
  \ Other states, however, show considerable gaps here, and gender history is often
  reduced to 'women's history', which in turn is limited to a small number of topics
  such as the Industrial Revolution or the emancipation of women.27 Once again, the
  textbooks do not make full use of the opportunities offered by the curricula to
  integrate the findings of recent historical scholarship. They hardly ever address
  gender as a historical category or even employ it as an analytical instrument. Still,
  textbooks are not the only (and perhaps not even the primary) targets for this criticism:
  a wealth of academic works can also be considered guilty of the same neglect.This
  verdict can be modified somewhat if we consider the impact of the increasing quantity
  of 'women's history' produced over the past two decades, which can hardly be ignored
  by any contemporary textbook. Most textbooks offer a narrative (often somewhat moralizing)
  of the liberation of women and a thorough and critical analysis of the process.
  The 'Path of Women towards Equality' is usually pursued through many historical
  events, though sometimes taken out of its historical context (and in some cases
  it is obvious that the publisher has merely added some paragraphs or chapters on
  women without any change to the books' overall approach).28  This is a significant
  example of authors' recognition of their obligation to reflect and obey the Zeitgeist.29
  \ Yet the conclusion remains that German textbooks have only rarely digested the
  concepts of modern gender history. They remain focused on women's emancipation,
  which in most textbooks is seen as a concept successfully developed in the West
  and closely related to democracy â and this underlying assumption is not disclosed
  or discussed.Since the 1980s the history profession has increasingly opened up to
  postcolonial theories, especially in the Anglo-Saxon world. The various violent
  or non-violent forms assumed by power, hegemony and cultural contact between the
  'West' and the 'rest' were at the centre of this interest, together with the question
  of how colonialism affected the colonized peoples and the self-image of Europe and
  the Europeans. In examining how the teaching of history has been influenced by these
  new approaches and interests, we should bear in mind that colonialism as well as
  decolonization has not been as important an issue for Germany as for Belgium, Great
  Britain or France, for instance. Furthermore, research approaches in this field
  are still relatively new in Germany, having only begun in the mid 1990s, and they
  have yet to make their mark on scholarly discourse.30  In the light of this and
  [End Page 130]  of the long delay between the emergence of new scholarship and its
  wider dissemination, our expectations of curricula and textbooks must not be placed
  too high. Although most of the curricula we analysed include the topics of 'Colonialism'
  and 'Decolonization', the shifts of perspective necessary for postcolonial approaches
  are incorporated into curricula and guidelines in only a few German states, and
  even then mostly limited to sixth-form level.The extreme differences among the curricula
  are especially striking at sixth-form level. Here we find almost every variation,
  from ignoring the topic altogether to discussing the issue in a fashion that at
  times comes close to scholarly approaches. Some states, such as Lower Saxony,31
  \ demonstrate a considerable willingness to experiment (as with the topic of gender
  history) and welcome this issue with interest; other states, particularly Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg
  and Bavaria,32  are diffident about postcolonial approaches; and some completely
  ignore them.It is not surprising, therefore, that the results of the textbook analysis
  were fairly uniform and disappointing. Nearly all textbooks need to be updated,
  with a few exceptions. To be sure, imperialism and colonialism â if they are mentioned
  at all â are not depicted primarily as 'civilizing missions' but rather as a history
  of violence and exploitation, inequality and disregard for native cultures. Tempora
  2, for instance, dedicates an entire section to the topic 'North and South â Inequality
  in the World' (pp. 459â87). Yet a critical postcolonial perspective on modernization
  seldom figures: instead, an almost uncritical image of the Western path to modernity
  underlies the portrayal (p. 463).33 Moreover, primary sources from the pen of the
  ruling forces tend to dominate; the colonized remain for the most part without a
  voice, and sometimes are not even visible. This reinforces the one-way transfer
  of knowledge to the pupils. In most German textbooks there is little trace of an
  'entangled' history, in which pupils can learn how different cultures and societies
  have shared a wealth of experiences, both positive and negative, and in which they
  can be sensitized to processes of interaction and interdependence between Europe
  and the world regions (previously) colonized by Europeans.Only a few textbooks make
  it clear that one culture has conquered, reshaped, altered and destroyed another
  in order to rule, or that other forms of colonization, even if primarily non-violent,
  are still in effect even today â for instance, via language or academic cultures.
  Some imbalances, such as the economic legacies of European colonial policies, are
  mentioned with increasing regularity. However, more reflective questions as to how
  the self and the 'other' are construed are extremely rare. Similarly, the many Eurocentric
  interpretations that pupils still encounter in their daily lives are barely subjected
  to debate. European history may have achieved a higher standing than national history
  alone, yet it has not been truly extended into a world history or written from an
  external perspective. [End Page 131] It was only quite recently, by comparison with
  many of its European neighbours, that Germany accepted its status as a country of
  immigration, which is almost certainly due to its low level of post-colonial migration.
  The issue of 'migration and education' was for a long time subordinate to the assumption
  that there would be a stronger stake in cultural homogeneity. But wider public debate
  developed with the accumulation of problems at the end of the 1990s and especially
  after the 2003 PISA Test produced disastrous results from German schoolchildren,
  particularly with regard to immigrant children (second as well as first-generation
  immigrants).34  Growing importance is attached in history teaching to the question
  whose history is relevant and who should â or should not â enjoy authority and agency
  in a historical perspective.35 All school curricula include the theme of other cultures.
  Even the most conservative states define tolerance and empathy towards ethnic or
  religious minorities, as well as human-rights education, as central educational
  goals. The Bavarian history curriculum, for example, declares,It is part of everyday
  life that pupils from completely different European and non-European countries learn
  and work together in a class, and it reflects a part of our life as a society. It
  is part of the educational and disciplinary task of the Realschule to use this situation
  to good educational effect, preparing pupils for a life in which people and cultures
  live together respecting human rights, supporting one another and tackling differences
  of opinion and conflicts in a peaceful manner.36 But how do curricula try to implement
  these goals? How should the perspectives of ethnic, religious or cultural minorities
  be represented and integrated into history education? Is it merely a question of
  tolerating the 'other', or is it rather a matter of respect, representation and
  ultimately of a citizenship education that addresses all children on an equal footing?It
  is difficult to give definitive answers to these questions. Some curricula focus
  on 'tolerance' and consider immigrants and other minorities largely as objects of
  study. Others ask teachers and textbook authors to shift perspectives and to see
  immigrants in the role of subjects.37  The marginalization of global perspectives
  proves to be disadvantageous in this respect. As 'the world' is now sitting in the
  classroom, it would make sense to integrate it further into history lessons, and
  to place greater importance on discussing concepts of self and 'other' in history
  and culture.In reality, however, curricula in more than half the German states,
  including Bremen, Hesse, Saxony, Thuringia, Saarland, Bavaria and Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg,
  tend to ignore the global as well as the postcolonial dimensions of history. Lower
  Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia deal with the topic quite admirably, but again
  mainly in the sixth form. So a large percentage of German pupils never have the
  opportunity to recognize [End Page 132]  changing perceptions and the conflicts
  surrounding them. The same is true of portrayals of the religious history of Europe,
  which is depicted with far less complexity and differentiation in curricula for
  the Realschule or, even more, for the Hauptschule than those for the Gymnasium.
  This is problematic in view of the fact that the student bodies of the Hauptschule
  are dramatically more diverse in terms of religion and ethnicity.38 How do the textbooks
  deal with questions that challenge the education system in all federal states? As
  a general rule, it can be said that all recent textbooks accept the increasing diversity
  of cultural patterns and the presence of immigrants in numerous facets of society
  as a productive challenge, and make efforts to dedicate more space in the textbooks
  to minority issues. Often, as with gender history, this is only achieved by adding
  new chapters â on such topics as the history of migration or the coexistence of
  minorities and majorities. Some new textbooks explicitly point out that Germany
  and Europe have always been characterized by migration, cultural contacts and the
  fact that different social, religious or ethnic groups have lived together, both
  amicably and with conflict.39  Generally, however, almost no history textbooks address
  shifts between minority and majority perspectives or tensions between perceptions
  of the self and the 'other' as a basis for understanding the whole or to show the
  fundamental role of cultural diversity and transfer, as well as the conflicts they
  involve over time.In the textbooks immigrants and other minorities somehow always
  remain the 'others'. They appear as either the victims or the culprits of unfortunate
  developments, always somehow 'a problem' for the majority.40  Furthermore, pictures
  of immigrants in almost all textbooks tend to equip them with features typically
  associated with 'otherness' â particular skin and hair colour or a certain type
  of clothing.41  The label of 'other' thus remains, and stereotypes are reinforced
  rather than dissolved. This does not exactly support the increased understanding
  of the 'other' envisaged by education bureaucrats.It is, however, extremely difficult
  to escape this interpretative trap. The challenge for authors of implementing an
  integrative concept is exemplified by the manner in which Jewish history is integrated
  â or perhaps we should say not integrated â into general or German history.42  The
  detailed study of the Shoah is now solidly established as a horrific chapter of
  German history; and Holocaust education has long served in all German schools as
  an important instrument of general human-rights education and of teaching pupils
  to think beyond national perspectives.This is without a doubt a welcome development.
  It does, however, still make it difficult for curriculum and textbook authors to
  convey Jewish history as 'beyond tragedy' and detached from the perspective of the
  victims. The space allocated to aspects of Jewish history in German textbooks has
  dramatically increased since the mid 1990s. Textbooks have also been making efforts
  to work with multiple perspectives in the chapters on [End Page 133]  National Socialism,
  and to give a voice to the persecuted, the humiliated and the resistance alongside
  the sources from the perpetrators, which still tend to dominate. The processes of
  integration and assimilation remain for the most part unknown to the pupils, with
  the result that a centuries-long history of a complex relationship that was rich
  in tension, yet at the same time extremely fruitful, is frequently reduced to one
  of persecution and discrimination. Either Jewish history is dealt with in special
  chapters, thus encouraging a sense of 'otherness'; or the Jews are contrasted with
  the majority and presented primarily in the role of victims. These depictions distort
  not only the pupils' view of Jewish aspects of German national history, but also
  their understanding of significant inner-Jewish developments such as the Haskalah,
  the Jewish Enlightenment. The consequence is obvious: Jews seldom appear as active
  players, and this encourages the impression that historical agency was enjoyed only
  by the (non-Jewish) majority, shifting the minority further into a subaltern status.43
  \ The fact that hardly any textbooks mention the refounding of Jewish communities
  in postwar Germany serves to support this impression. The message, if unintentional,
  is that Jews have only a tragic history in Germany. Their present and future are
  barely touched upon.The case is somewhat different for representations of Muslims,
  no doubt because of their present situation in Germany. Muslims figure in textbooks
  with particular frequency in chapters dealing with the crusades and violent advances
  of Islam towards Europe. The hidden messages â including those conveyed in illustrations
  â are often problematic, both for the past and the present. Muslims appear either
  as immigrants who have problems or cause them, or as terrorists.44  Textbook readers
  almost never encounter Muslims who have been living in Europe as Europeans for centuries,
  for instance in the Balkans or in Russian Tatarstan. It is especially problematic
  here that Islam is either discussed largely in the context of global security issues
  or depicted as a purely religious phenomenon, and then in an essentialist, idealized
  form (Christianity, on the other hand, is depicted historically). Although Islam
  has been a component of European history for centuries, it is portrayed in most
  textbooks as an 'other' that is somehow foreign and 'oriental'.Nevertheless a linear
  analysis of the Islam narrative in German textbooks does reveal some changes, such
  as the now frequent portrayal of the crusades as a history shared by different cultures,
  and not just a military encounter. Additionally, some textbooks make efforts to
  give a voice to both sides and to provide pupils with opportunities to learn about
  the different points of view and reach their own judgements. As Gerdien Jonker has
  pointed out, 'In this narrative, German identity is no longer the issue. It has
  been replaced by a search for Europe's status in world society.'45 This turn towards
  a European perspective, albeit via harmonized and affirmational tendencies, certainly
  brings new opportunities. On the one hand, European history has always enjoyed a
  certain plurality (and, in the [End Page 134]  Balkans, a Muslim majority), despite
  the dominance of Christianity. Europe is thus confronted with diversity and has
  to deal with it; a European identity free of openness towards 'others' and 'outsiders'
  is unthinkable. On the other hand, the Europeanization of minority histories can
  place historic phenomena such as emancipation and anti-semitism into a larger context,
  thus helping to historicize them.46  At the same time, however, it appears that
  the non-Christian minorities have become the 'victims' of a stronger focus on Europe
  and its history: the more defined the search for common European traditions, the
  stronger the focus on 'legitimating' Europe in its roots in Latin Christianity and
  the religious Enlightenment, and with this the secularization of the state.47 Up
  until now, and unlike in the USA, hardly any powerful lobby for adequate representation
  of minorities has existed in Germany. In this regard, the practice of merely 'mentioning'
  minorities, and thereby confirming their powerlessness, is as rare in Germany as
  the structural broadening of textbook contents that it would entail.48  The number
  of pages in German history textbooks has remained relatively constant for years
  â about 300 pages for years nine and ten. This means that in Germany â unlike in
  the USA, where pupils are confronted with books of a thousand pages, because each
  social group demands adequate representation in textbooks and possesses the power
  to get it â the incorporation of new aspects must be 'bought' at the cost of other
  aspects.German curricula and textbooks have adopted new specialist historical and
  didactic concepts in a wide variety of ways. Due to the federal structure of the
  education system and to the existence of different school types, the conceptions
  of historical knowledge and the main aims of history teaching vary significantly
  from state to state and also from one school type to another, as this essay has
  aimed to show. All curricula need updating in some aspects: this is recognized both
  in education policy and also by textbook authors and publishers, and most curricula
  and textbooks demonstrate that attempts are being made to keep up to date and to
  adopt at least main ideas of modern historical scholarship and pedagogy.As a general
  rule, the textbooks try hard to address current affairs and developments. Almost
  all textbooks published in the last few years refer to the events of 11 September
  2001, or to the contradictory process of globalization.49  Equally, the majority
  of history textbooks now deal with aspects of social, everyday and cultural history
  alongside the classical approaches of political history and high culture, to a far
  greater extent than in the 1970s and 1980s. But international or transnational perspectives
  are generally restricted to the history of politics, diplomacy and events. For reasons
  related to approval systems, politics and the market economy, the underlying tendency
  of German textbooks remains conservative in many respects. They are nevertheless
  open to new concepts, even in matters of design. [End Page 135]  The modern textbook
  may not offer everything the pupil's heart might desire in terms of visual layout
  and graphics, yet the general portrayal, the scholarship and the pedagogical and
  educational concepts are pupil-focused and receptive to new ideas. Almost all history
  books do offer practical advice on historical work, and most textbooks, especially
  those for Gymnasium and Realschule, follow the concept of a workbook, albeit with
  varying consistency. They always include specific chapters on multiple perspectives
  and methods of historical thinking, offering a history based on interpretation with
  the textbook as a source. Most German textbooks, especially those for Gymnasium,
  try to meet the important didactic criteria of multi-perspectivity, recognition
  of conflicting opinions and training in the ability to deconstruct narratives or
  historical myths. But whether this will now change as a result of the move towards
  a more test-oriented educational system remains to be seen.Simone LÃ¤ssig completed

  four years of primary school (six in Berlin and Brandenburg), parents receive a

  the new edition of Tempora 2 in 2004, for example, the publisher notes that the
  edition has been 'extended to include a chapter on gender history'. Women, it explains
  'must' now evidently be featured in the textbook, so a chapter was simply 'attached'.
  This process is reflected by the manner in which the book deals with the issue.
  It is conceived purely as 'women's history', and ultimately merely attached to 'real
  history'. As a result, 'women' tend to be marginalized.29.Â In the U.S., this phenomenon
