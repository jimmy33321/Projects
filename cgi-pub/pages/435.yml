  before she moved from Pakistan to the United States and none of them found her social
  media posts about jihad. \n"
- "The New York Times reports U.S. law enforcement officials discovered old and previously
  unreported postings as they investigated Malik and her husband Syed Rizwan Farook.
  Immigration officials don’t usually check social media posts as part of their background
  checks, according to the newspaper. \n"
- "Malik’s path to the U.S. immediately highlighted the U.S. government’s immigration
  vetting practices after she was identified as one of the attackers in San Bernardino,
  Calif. The Obama administration is reviewing the program, Homeland Security Secretary
  Jeh Johnson said Monday. He didn’t specify what changes were going to be made. \n"
- "Johnson said it was too soon to tell if the government missed signs that Malik
  may have been radicalized before she was approved for her visa. \n"
- |
  "That assumes, and this investigation is still under way, that there were flags that were raised or should have been raised in the process of her admission to the United States, and I am not prepared to say that and I'm not prepared to make that declaration," Johnson said.

- "    \n"
- "   \n"
- "The K-1 visa program is among the smallest visa categories managed by the government.
  Of more than 9.9 million visas issued in fiscal 2014, just 35,925 -- roughly 0.3
  percent -- were fiance visas, according to State Department figures. \n"
- "Much of the focus is on rooting out marriage fraud. A couple must prove they have
  physically seen each other within the past two years, unless meeting in person would
  violate \"strict and long-established customs\" or cause an \"extreme hardship.\"
  \n"
- "The applicants are subject to a vetting process that includes at least one in-person
  interview, fingerprints, checks against U.S. terrorist watch lists and reviews family
  members, travel history and places where a person has lived and worked. Social media
  include is rarely included. \n"
- "Foreigners applying from countries recognized as home to Islamic extremists, such
  as Pakistan, undergo additional scrutiny before the State Department and Homeland
  Security Department approve permission for a visa. Malik had been living in Pakistan
  and visiting family in Saudi Arabia before she passed the background check and entered
  the U.S. in July 2014 with Farook, a U.S. citizen whose family was originally from
  Pakistan. \n"
- "In the social media era, it seems impossible that something like a supportive tweet
  or post would go unnoticed during the vetting process. However, The New York Times
  reports the screenings are trade-offs as the try to lessen the threat of terrorism
  while keeping the border open for business and travel. \n"
- "“We run people against watch lists and that’s how we decided if they get extra
  screening,” C. Stewart Verdery Jr., a senior Homeland Security official during George
  W. Bush’s administration, told The Times. “In cases where those lists don’t hit,
  there’s nothing that distinguishes them from people we would love to welcome to
  this country.” \n"
- "Malik was vetted by three separate American agencies before entering the country.
  First, Homeland Security checked her name against law enforcement and national security
  databases. Then, her application went through to the State Department, which reviewed
  her fingerprints against other databases and finally, she applied for a green card
  and was thoroughly reviewed once more. \n"
- "Related ImageExpand / ContractThis undated combination of file photos provided
  by the FBI, left, and the California Department of Motor Vehicles shows Tashfeen
  Malik, left, and Syed Farook. (AP) \n"
- "When asked whether the refugee vetting process for Middle Eastern refugees included
  terror ties, lawmakers received three different Wednesday. \n"
- "Lawmakers at three separate hearings, including at which FBI Director James Comey
  testified, demanded to know how she gained admittance, especially given discrepancies
  in her application. \n"
- "“Was she actually given an interview in the K-1 process, do we know that?” Sen.
  David Purdue, R-Ga., asked the FBI boss during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary
  Committee oversight hearing. \n"
- "Comey replied that “the process requires” an interview, but that he didn’t know
  if one occurred. \n"
- "An interview and a cursory check of Malik’s application might have revealed that
  she used a phony address and had attended an Islamist school in Pakistan which critics
  say forges an anti-Western view in students. \n"
- "On the same day, Leon Rodriguez, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services,
  told lawmakers in the Lower House no interview was required. \n"
- "“We only interview people in the K1 visa program in cases where there is some issue
  that needs to be explored as part of the case,” Rodriguez said in response to a
  question from Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., who chairs the House subcommittee on Immigration
  and Border Security. “That could be derogatory information about the individual. 
  It could be factual questions not necessarily derogatory about the application.
  That is the existing practice as we speak.” \n"
- "Finally, a State Department official told yet another panel the screening process
  that allowed Malik into the U.S., where she paired with Farook to commit a massacre
  went smoothly and by the book. \n"
- "“All applicable security checks were done for that individual, Ms. Malik,” said
  Edward Ramotowski, the department’s deputy assistant for visa services told another
  Senate panel. “That includes an immigrant visa interview, it includes facial recognition
  screening, it includes interagency counterterrorism screening, it included a review
  by the visa security unit of immigration and customs enforcement, which as a detachment
  in Islamabad in our embassy there and it included the full biometric fingerprint
  checks and in all cases, the results of those checks were clear.  There were no
  indications of any ill intent by that individual at the time the visa was issued.
  “ \n"
- "Still, a debate continues at United States Citizenship and Immigration services
  agency over whether officials conducting interviews should be allowed to use social
  media information for interviews where they determine whether foreigners pose a
  security risk, according to The Times. \n"
- "Search teams in San Bernardino are still trying to trace the digital footprints
  of Malik and Farook.  \n"
- "Divers scouring a lake in a San Bernardino park were searching for a hard drive
  that may have been thrown into the lake by the couple on the same day as the attack.
  Authorities wrapped up their search Saturday, recovering several objects but not
  revealing what they were. \n"
- "The Associated Press contributed to this report. \n"

- Sign in to comment!Tashfeen Malik, who along with her husband killed 14 people in
  Southern California, reportedly passed three background checks by American officials
  before she moved from Pakistan to the United States and none of them found her social
  media posts about jihad.The New York Times reports U.S. law enforcement officials
  discovered old and previously unreported postings as they investigated Malik and
  her husband Syed Rizwan Farook. Immigration officials don’t usually check social
  media posts as part of their background checks, according to the newspaper.Malik’s
  path to the U.S. immediately highlighted the U.S. government’s immigration vetting
  practices after she was identified as one of the attackers in San Bernardino, Calif.
  The Obama administration is reviewing the program, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh
  Johnson said Monday. He didn’t specify what changes were going to be made.Johnson
  said it was too soon to tell if the government missed signs that Malik may have
  been radicalized before she was approved for her visa."That assumes, and this investigation
  is still under way, that there were flags that were raised or should have been raised
  in the process of her admission to the United States, and I am not prepared to say
  that and I'm not prepared to make that declaration," Johnson said.The K-1 visa program
  is among the smallest visa categories managed by the government. Of more than 9.9
  million visas issued in fiscal 2014, just 35,925 -- roughly 0.3 percent -- were
  fiance visas, according to State Department figures.Much of the focus is on rooting
  out marriage fraud. A couple must prove they have physically seen each other within
  the past two years, unless meeting in person would violate "strict and long-established
  customs" or cause an "extreme hardship."The applicants are subject to a vetting
  process that includes at least one in-person interview, fingerprints, checks against
  U.S. terrorist watch lists and reviews family members, travel history and places
  where a person has lived and worked. Social media include is rarely included.Foreigners
  applying from countries recognized as home to Islamic extremists, such as Pakistan,
  undergo additional scrutiny before the State Department and Homeland Security Department
  approve permission for a visa. Malik had been living in Pakistan and visiting family
  in Saudi Arabia before she passed the background check and entered the U.S. in July
  2014 with Farook, a U.S. citizen whose family was originally from Pakistan.In the
  social media era, it seems impossible that something like a supportive tweet or
  post would go unnoticed during the vetting process. However, The New York Times
  reports the screenings are trade-offs as the try to lessen the threat of terrorism
  while keeping the border open for business and travel.“We run people against watch
  lists and that’s how we decided if they get extra screening,” C. Stewart Verdery
  Jr., a senior Homeland Security official during George W. Bush’s administration,
  told The Times. “In cases where those lists don’t hit, there’s nothing that distinguishes
  them from people we would love to welcome to this country.”Malik was vetted by three
  separate American agencies before entering the country. First, Homeland Security
  checked her name against law enforcement and national security databases. Then,
  her application went through to the State Department, which reviewed her fingerprints
  against other databases and finally, she applied for a green card and was thoroughly
  reviewed once more.This undated combination of file photos provided by the FBI,
  left, and the California Department of Motor Vehicles shows Tashfeen Malik, left,
  and Syed Farook. (AP)When asked whether the refugee vetting process for Middle Eastern
  refugees included terror ties, lawmakers received three different Wednesday.Lawmakers
  at three separate hearings, including at which FBI Director James Comey testified,
  demanded to know how she gained admittance, especially given discrepancies in her
  application.“Was she actually given an interview in the K-1 process, do we know
  that?” Sen. David Purdue, R-Ga., asked the FBI boss during a hearing before the
  Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing.Comey replied that “the process requires”
  an interview, but that he didn’t know if one occurred.An interview and a cursory
  check of Malik’s application might have revealed that she used a phony address and
  had attended an Islamist school in Pakistan which critics say forges an anti-Western
  view in students.On the same day, Leon Rodriguez, director of U.S. Citizenship and
  Immigration Services, told lawmakers in the Lower House no interview was required.“We
  only interview people in the K1 visa program in cases where there is some issue
  that needs to be explored as part of the case,” Rodriguez said in response to a
  question from Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., who chairs the House subcommittee on Immigration
  and Border Security. “That could be derogatory information about the individual. 
  It could be factual questions not necessarily derogatory about the application.
  That is the existing practice as we speak.”Finally, a State Department official
  told yet another panel the screening process that allowed Malik into the U.S., where
  she paired with Farook to commit a massacre went smoothly and by the book.“All applicable
  security checks were done for that individual, Ms. Malik,” said Edward Ramotowski,
  the department’s deputy assistant for visa services told another Senate panel. “That
  includes an immigrant visa interview, it includes facial recognition screening,
  it includes interagency counterterrorism screening, it included a review by the
  visa security unit of immigration and customs enforcement, which as a detachment
  in Islamabad in our embassy there and it included the full biometric fingerprint
  checks and in all cases, the results of those checks were clear.  There were no
  indications of any ill intent by that individual at the time the visa was issued.
  “Still, a debate continues at United States Citizenship and Immigration services
  agency over whether officials conducting interviews should be allowed to use social
  media information for interviews where they determine whether foreigners pose a
  security risk, according to The Times.Search teams in San Bernardino are still trying
  to trace the digital footprints of Malik and Farook. Divers scouring a lake in a
  San Bernardino park were searching for a hard drive that may have been thrown into
  the lake by the couple on the same day as the attack. Authorities wrapped up their
  search Saturday, recovering several objects but not revealing what they were.The
  Associated Press contributed to this report.Click for more from The New York Times.AdvertisementAdvertisementThis

  who along with her husband killed 14 people in Southern California, reportedly passed
  three background checks by American officials before she moved from Pakistan to
  the United States and none of them found her social media posts about jihad. \nThe
  New York Times reports U.S. law enforcement officials discovered old and previously
  unreported postings as they investigated Malik and her husband Syed Rizwan Farook.
  Immigration officials don’t usually check social media posts as part of their background
  checks, according to the newspaper. \nMalik’s path to the U.S. immediately highlighted
  the U.S. government’s immigration vetting practices after she was identified as
  one of the attackers in San Bernardino, Calif. The Obama administration is reviewing
  the program, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Monday. He didn’t specify
  what changes were going to be made. \nJohnson said it was too soon to tell if the
  government missed signs that Malik may have been radicalized before she was approved
  for her visa. \n\"That assumes, and this investigation is still under way, that
  there were flags that were raised or should have been raised in the process of her
  admission to the United States, and I am not prepared to say that and I'm not prepared
  to make that declaration,\" Johnson said.\n\n More on this...\n  \n    How did Tashfeen
  Malik pass 'rigorous' US visa screening? \n    \n   \n    California attack exposes

  suspects' marriage for jihad? \n    \n   \n    New scrutiny for K-1 visa used by
  Tashfeen Malik to enter US \n    \n   \nThe K-1 visa program is among the smallest
  visa categories managed by the government. Of more than 9.9 million visas issued
  in fiscal 2014, just 35,925 -- roughly 0.3 percent -- were fiance visas, according
  to State Department figures. \nMuch of the focus is on rooting out marriage fraud.
  A couple must prove they have physically seen each other within the past two years,
  unless meeting in person would violate \"strict and long-established customs\" or
  cause an \"extreme hardship.\" \nThe applicants are subject to a vetting process
  that includes at least one in-person interview, fingerprints, checks against U.S.
  terrorist watch lists and reviews family members, travel history and places where
  a person has lived and worked. Social media include is rarely included. \nForeigners
  applying from countries recognized as home to Islamic extremists, such as Pakistan,
  undergo additional scrutiny before the State Department and Homeland Security Department
  approve permission for a visa. Malik had been living in Pakistan and visiting family
  in Saudi Arabia before she passed the background check and entered the U.S. in July
  2014 with Farook, a U.S. citizen whose family was originally from Pakistan. \nIn
  the social media era, it seems impossible that something like a supportive tweet
  or post would go unnoticed during the vetting process. However, The New York Times
  reports the screenings are trade-offs as the try to lessen the threat of terrorism
  while keeping the border open for business and travel. \n“We run people against
  watch lists and that’s how we decided if they get extra screening,” C. Stewart Verdery
  Jr., a senior Homeland Security official during George W. Bush’s administration,
  told The Times. “In cases where those lists don’t hit, there’s nothing that distinguishes
  them from people we would love to welcome to this country.” \nMalik was vetted by
  three separate American agencies before entering the country. First, Homeland Security
  checked her name against law enforcement and national security databases. Then,
  her application went through to the State Department, which reviewed her fingerprints
  against other databases and finally, she applied for a green card and was thoroughly
  reviewed once more. \nRelated ImageExpand / ContractThis undated combination of
  file photos provided by the FBI, left, and the California Department of Motor Vehicles
  shows Tashfeen Malik, left, and Syed Farook. (AP) \nWhen asked whether the refugee
  vetting process for Middle Eastern refugees included terror ties, lawmakers received
  three different Wednesday. \nLawmakers at three separate hearings, including at
  which FBI Director James Comey testified, demanded to know how she gained admittance,
  especially given discrepancies in her application. \n“Was she actually given an
  interview in the K-1 process, do we know that?” Sen. David Purdue, R-Ga., asked
  the FBI boss during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing.
  \nComey replied that “the process requires” an interview, but that he didn’t know
  if one occurred. \nAn interview and a cursory check of Malik’s application might
  have revealed that she used a phony address and had attended an Islamist school
  in Pakistan which critics say forges an anti-Western view in students. \nOn the
  same day, Leon Rodriguez, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services,
  told lawmakers in the Lower House no interview was required. \n“We only interview
  people in the K1 visa program in cases where there is some issue that needs to be
  explored as part of the case,” Rodriguez said in response to a question from Rep.
  Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., who chairs the House subcommittee on Immigration and Border
  Security. “That could be derogatory information about the individual.  It could
  be factual questions not necessarily derogatory about the application. That is the
  existing practice as we speak.” \nFinally, a State Department official told yet
  another panel the screening process that allowed Malik into the U.S., where she
  paired with Farook to commit a massacre went smoothly and by the book. \n“All applicable
  security checks were done for that individual, Ms. Malik,” said Edward Ramotowski,
  the department’s deputy assistant for visa services told another Senate panel. “That
  includes an immigrant visa interview, it includes facial recognition screening,
  it includes interagency counterterrorism screening, it included a review by the
  visa security unit of immigration and customs enforcement, which as a detachment
  in Islamabad in our embassy there and it included the full biometric fingerprint
  checks and in all cases, the results of those checks were clear.  There were no
  indications of any ill intent by that individual at the time the visa was issued.
  “ \nStill, a debate continues at United States Citizenship and Immigration services
  agency over whether officials conducting interviews should be allowed to use social
  media information for interviews where they determine whether foreigners pose a
  security risk, according to The Times. \nSearch teams in San Bernardino are still
  trying to trace the digital footprints of Malik and Farook.  \nDivers scouring a
  lake in a San Bernardino park were searching for a hard drive that may have been
  thrown into the lake by the couple on the same day as the attack. Authorities wrapped
  up their search Saturday, recovering several objects but not revealing what they
  were. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \nClick for more from The

  her husband killed 14 people in Southern California, reportedly passed three background
  checks by American officials before she moved from Pakistan to the United States
  and none of them found her social media posts about jihad.The New York Times reports
  U.S. law enforcement officials discovered old and previously unreported postings
  as they investigated Malik and her husband Syed Rizwan Farook. Immigration officials
  don’t usually check social media posts as part of their background checks, according
  to the newspaper.Malik’s path to the U.S. immediately highlighted the U.S. government’s
  immigration vetting practices after she was identified as one of the attackers in
  San Bernardino, Calif. The Obama administration is reviewing the program, Homeland
  Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Monday. He didn’t specify what changes were
  going to be made.Johnson said it was too soon to tell if the government missed signs
  that Malik may have been radicalized before she was approved for her visa.\"That
  assumes, and this investigation is still under way, that there were flags that were
  raised or should have been raised in the process of her admission to the United
  States, and I am not prepared to say that and I'm not prepared to make that declaration,\"
  Johnson said.The K-1 visa program is among the smallest visa categories managed
  by the government. Of more than 9.9 million visas issued in fiscal 2014, just 35,925
  -- roughly 0.3 percent -- were fiance visas, according to State Department figures.Much
  of the focus is on rooting out marriage fraud. A couple must prove they have physically
  seen each other within the past two years, unless meeting in person would violate
  \"strict and long-established customs\" or cause an \"extreme hardship.\"The applicants
  are subject to a vetting process that includes at least one in-person interview,
  fingerprints, checks against U.S. terrorist watch lists and reviews family members,
  travel history and places where a person has lived and worked. Social media include
  is rarely included.Foreigners applying from countries recognized as home to Islamic
  extremists, such as Pakistan, undergo additional scrutiny before the State Department
  and Homeland Security Department approve permission for a visa. Malik had been living
  in Pakistan and visiting family in Saudi Arabia before she passed the background
  check and entered the U.S. in July 2014 with Farook, a U.S. citizen whose family
  was originally from Pakistan.In the social media era, it seems impossible that something
  like a supportive tweet or post would go unnoticed during the vetting process. However,
  The New York Times reports the screenings are trade-offs as the try to lessen the
  threat of terrorism while keeping the border open for business and travel.“We run
  people against watch lists and that’s how we decided if they get extra screening,”
  C. Stewart Verdery Jr., a senior Homeland Security official during George W. Bush’s
  administration, told The Times. “In cases where those lists don’t hit, there’s nothing
  that distinguishes them from people we would love to welcome to this country.”Malik
  was vetted by three separate American agencies before entering the country. First,
  Homeland Security checked her name against law enforcement and national security
  databases. Then, her application went through to the State Department, which reviewed
  her fingerprints against other databases and finally, she applied for a green card
  and was thoroughly reviewed once more.This undated combination of file photos provided
  by the FBI, left, and the California Department of Motor Vehicles shows Tashfeen
  Malik, left, and Syed Farook. (AP)When asked whether the refugee vetting process
  for Middle Eastern refugees included terror ties, lawmakers received three different
  Wednesday.Lawmakers at three separate hearings, including at which FBI Director
  James Comey testified, demanded to know how she gained admittance, especially given
  discrepancies in her application.“Was she actually given an interview in the K-1
  process, do we know that?” Sen. David Purdue, R-Ga., asked the FBI boss during a
  hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing.Comey replied that
  “the process requires” an interview, but that he didn’t know if one occurred.An
  interview and a cursory check of Malik’s application might have revealed that she
  used a phony address and had attended an Islamist school in Pakistan which critics
  say forges an anti-Western view in students.On the same day, Leon Rodriguez, director
  of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, told lawmakers in the Lower House
  no interview was required.“We only interview people in the K1 visa program in cases
  where there is some issue that needs to be explored as part of the case,” Rodriguez
  said in response to a question from Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., who chairs the House
  subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security. “That could be derogatory information
  about the individual.  It could be factual questions not necessarily derogatory
  about the application. That is the existing practice as we speak.”Finally, a State
  Department official told yet another panel the screening process that allowed Malik
  into the U.S., where she paired with Farook to commit a massacre went smoothly and
  by the book.“All applicable security checks were done for that individual, Ms. Malik,”
  said Edward Ramotowski, the department’s deputy assistant for visa services told
  another Senate panel. “That includes an immigrant visa interview, it includes facial
  recognition screening, it includes interagency counterterrorism screening, it included
  a review by the visa security unit of immigration and customs enforcement, which
  as a detachment in Islamabad in our embassy there and it included the full biometric
  fingerprint checks and in all cases, the results of those checks were clear.  There
  were no indications of any ill intent by that individual at the time the visa was
  issued. “Still, a debate continues at United States Citizenship and Immigration
  services agency over whether officials conducting interviews should be allowed to
  use social media information for interviews where they determine whether foreigners
  pose a security risk, according to The Times.Search teams in San Bernardino are
  still trying to trace the digital footprints of Malik and Farook. Divers scouring
  a lake in a San Bernardino park were searching for a hard drive that may have been
  thrown into the lake by the couple on the same day as the attack. Authorities wrapped
  up their search Saturday, recovering several objects but not revealing what they
  were.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Click for more from The New
