- "PREFACE \n"
- |2+

- "A DBAFT of these lectures, written before they were delivered, \n"
- "contained considerably more technicalities and mathematics than \n"
- "the present text. Facing a large audience in which physicists \n"
- "and mathematicians were presumably a minority, I had to \n"
- "change my plans and to improvise a simplified presentation. \n"
- "Though this did not seem difficult on the platform of the Hall \n"
- "of Magdalen College, Oxford, the final formulation for publi- \n"
- "cation was not an easy task. I did not like replacing rigorous \n"
- "mathematical reasoning by that mixture of literary style, \n"
- "authority, and mystery which is often used by popularizing and \n"
- "philosophizing scientists. Thus, the idea occurred to me to \n"
- "preserve the mathematics by removing it to a detailed appendix \n"
- "which could also contain references to the literature. The vast \n"
- "extension of the latter, however, compelled me to restrict quota- \n"
- "tions to recent publications which are not in the text-books. \n"
- "Some of these supplements contain unpublished investigations \n"
- "of my school, mainly by my collaborator Dr. H. S. Green. In the \n"
- "text itself I have given up the original division into seven lec- \n"
- "tures and replaced it by a more natural arrangement into ten \n"
- "chapters. \n"
- |2+

- "I have to thank Dr. Green for his untiring help in reading, \n"
- "criticizing, and correcting my script, working out drafts of the \n"
- "appendix, and reading proofs. I am also indebted to Mr. Lewis \n"
- "Elton not only for proof-reading but for carefully preparing the \n"
- "index. I have further to thank Albert Einstein for permission \n"
- "to publish soctions of two of his letters. \n"
- |2+

- "My most sincere gratitude is due to the President and the \n"
- "Fellows of Magdalen College who gave me the opportunity to \n"
- "plan these lectures, and the leisure to write them down for \n"

- "THE notions of cause and chance which I propose to deal with \n"
- "in these lectures are not specifically physical concepts but have \n"
- "a much wider meaning and application. They are used, more or \n"
- "less vaguely, in everyday life. They appear, not only in all \n"
- "branches of science, but also in history, psychology, philosophy, \n"
- "and theology ; everywhere with a different shade of meaning. \n"
- "It would be far beyond my abilities to give an account of all \n"
- "these usages, or to attempt an analysis of the exact significance \n"
- "of the words 'cause 5 and 'chance' in each of them. However, \n"
- "it is obvious that there must be a common feature in the use of \n"
- "these notions, like the theme in a set of variations. Indeed, \n"
- "cause expresses the idea of necessity in the relation of events, \n"
- "while chance means just the opposite, complete randomness. \n"
- "Nature, as well as human affairs, seems to be subject to both \n"
- "necessity and accident. Yet even accident is not completely \n"
- "arbitrary, for there are laws of chance, formulated in the mathe- \n"
- "matical theory of probability, nor can the cause-effect relation \n"
- "be used for predicting the future with certainty, as this would \n"
- "require a complete knowledge of the relevant circumstances, \n"
- "present, past, or both together, which is not available. There \n"
- "seems to be a hopeless tangle of ideas. In fact, if you look \n"
- "through the literature on this problem you will find no satisfac- \n"
- "tory solution, no general agreement. Only in physics has a \n"
- "systematic attempt been made to use the notions of cause and \n"
- "chance in a way free from contradictions. Physicists form their \n"
- "notions through the interpretation of experiments. This method \n"
- "may rightly be called Natural Philosophy, a word still used for \n"
- "physics at the Scottish universities. In this sense I shall attempt \n"
- "to investigate the concepts of cause and chance in these lectures. \n"
- "My material will be taken mainly from physics, but I shall try \n"
- "to regard it with the attitude of the philosopher, and I hope that \n"
- "the results obtained will be of use wherever the concepts of \n"
- "cause and chance are applied. I know that such an attempt will \n"

- "a INTRODUCTION \n"
- |2+

- "science teaches only a narrow aspect of the world, and one which \n"
- "is of no great importance to man's mind. It is toie that many \n"
- "scientists are not philosophically minded and have hitherto \n"
- "shown much skill and ingenuity but little wisdom. I need hardly \n"
- "to enlarge on this subject. The practical applications of science \n"
- "have given us the means of a fuller and richer life, but also the \n"
- "means of destruction and devastation on a vast scale. Wise \n"
- "men would have considered the consequences of their activities \n"
- "before starting on them ; scientists have failed to do so, and only \n"
- "recently have they become conscious of their responsibilities to \n"
- "society. They have gained prestige as men of action, but they \n"
- "have lost credit as philosophers. Yet history shows that science \n"
- "has played a leading part in the development of human thought. \n"
- "It has not only supplied raw material to philosophy by gathering \n"
- "facts, but also evolved the fundamental concepts on how to deal \n"
- "with them. It suffices to mention the Copernican system of the \n"
- "universe, and the Newtonian dynamics which sprang from it. \n"
- "These originated the conceptions of space, time, matter, force, \n"
- "and motion for a long time to come, and had a mighty influence \n"
- "on many philosophical systems. It has been said that the meta- \n"
- "physics of any period is the offspring of the physics of the pre- \n"
- "ceding period. If this is true, it puts us physicists under the \n"
- "obligation to explain our ideas in a not-too-technical language. \n"
- "This is the purpose of the following lectures on a restricted \n"
- "though important field. I have made an attempt to avoid \n"
- "mathematics entirely, but failed. It would have meant an un- \n"
- "bearable clumsiness of expression and loss of clarity. A way out \n"
- "would have been the reduction of all higher mathematics to \n"
- "elementary methods in Euclidean style following the cele- \n"
- "brated example of Newton's Principia. But this would even \n"
- "have increased the clumsiness and destroyed what there is of \n"
- "aesthetic appeal. I personally think that more than 200 years \n"
- "after Newton there should be some progress in the assimilation of \n"
- "mathematics by those who are interested in natural philosophy. \n"
- "So I shall use ordinary language and formulae in a suitable \n"
- "mixture; but I shall not give proofs of theorems (they are \n"
- "collected in the Appendix). \n"

- "INTRODUCTION 3 \n"
- |2+

- "In this way I hope to explain how physics may throw some \n"
- "light on a problem which is not only important for abstract \n"
- "knowledge but also for the behaviour of man. An unrestricted \n"
- "belief in causality leads necessarily to the idea that the world is \n"
- "an automaton of which we ourselves are only little cog-wheels. \n"
- "This means materialistic determinism. It resembles very much \n"
- "that religious determinism accepted by different creeds, where \n"
- "the actions of men are believed to be determined from the \n"
- "beginning by a ruling of God. I cannot enlarge on the difficulties \n"
- "to which this idea leads if considered from the standpoint of \n"
- "ethical responsibility. The notion of divine predestination \n"
- "clashes with the notion of free will, in the same way as the \n"
- "assumption of an endless chain of natural causes. On the other \n"
- "hand, an unrestricted belief in chance is impossible, as it cannot \n"
- "be denied that there are a great many regularities in the world ; \n"
- "hence there can be, at most, 'regulated accident'. One has to \n"
- "postulate laws of chance which assume the appearance of laws \n"
- "of nature or laws for human behaviour. Such a philosophy \n"
- "would give ample space for free will, or even for the willed \n"
- "actions of gods and demons. In fact, all primitive polytheistic \n"
- "religions seem to be based on such a conception of nature : things \n"
- "happening in a haphazard way, except where some spirit inter- \n"
- "feres with a purpose. We reject to-day this demonologioal \n"
- "philosophy, but admit chance into the realm of exact science. \n"
- "Our philosophy is dualistic in this respect ; nature is ruled by \n"
- "laws of cause and laws of chance in a certain mixture. How is \n"
- "this possible? Are there no logical contradictions? Can this \n"
- "mixture of ideas be cast into a consistent system in which all \n"
- "phenomena can be adequately described or explained ? What \n"
- "do we mean by such an explanation if the feature of chance is \n"
- "involved ? What are the irreducible or metaphysical principles \n"
- "inyolved ? Is there any room in this system for free will or for \n"
- "the interference of deity ? These and many other questions can \n"
- "be asked. I shall try to answer some of them from the stand- \n"
- "point of the physicist, others from my philosophical convictions \n"
- "which are not much more than common sense improved by \n"

- "physics has given up causality is entirely unfounded. Modem \n"
- "physics, it is true, has given up or modified many traditional \n"
- "ideas ; but it would cease to be a science if it had given up the \n"
- "search for the causes of phenomena. I found it necessary, \n"
- "therefore, to formulate the different aspects of the fundamental \n"
- "notions by giving definitions of terms which seem to me in agree- \n"
- "ment with ordinary language. With the help of these concepts, \n"
- "I shall survey the development of physical thought, dwelling \n"

- "entangle these notions and eventually sum them up in definitions. \n"
- "The cause-effect relation is used mainly in two ways ; I shall \n"
- "illustrate this by giving examples, partly from ordinary life, \n"
- "partly from science. Take these statements : \n"

  DBAFT of these lectures, written before they were delivered, \ncontained considerably
  more technicalities and mathematics than \nthe present text. Facing a large audience
  in which physicists \nand mathematicians were presumably a minority, I had to \nchange
  my plans and to improvise a simplified presentation. \nThough this did not seem
  difficult on the platform of the Hall \nof Magdalen College, Oxford, the final formulation
  for publi- \ncation was not an easy task. I did not like replacing rigorous \nmathematical
  reasoning by that mixture of literary style, \nauthority, and mystery which is often
  used by popularizing and \nphilosophizing scientists. Thus, the idea occurred to
  me to \npreserve the mathematics by removing it to a detailed appendix \nwhich could
  also contain references to the literature. The vast \nextension of the latter, however,
  compelled me to restrict quota- \ntions to recent publications which are not in
  the text-books. \nSome of these supplements contain unpublished investigations \nof
  my school, mainly by my collaborator Dr. H. S. Green. In the \ntext itself I have
  given up the original division into seven lec- \ntures and replaced it by a more
  natural arrangement into ten \nchapters. \n\nI have to thank Dr. Green for his untiring
  help in reading, \ncriticizing, and correcting my script, working out drafts of
  the \nappendix, and reading proofs. I am also indebted to Mr. Lewis \nElton not
  only for proof-reading but for carefully preparing the \nindex. I have further to
  thank Albert Einstein for permission \nto publish soctions of two of his letters.
  \n\nMy most sincere gratitude is due to the President and the \nFellows of Magdalen
  College who gave me the opportunity to \nplan these lectures, and the leisure to
  write them down for \npublication. \n\nI wish to thank the Oxford University Press
  for the excellent \nprinting and their willingness to follow all my wishes. \n\nM.

  by means of clarendon \ntype in print is now well established, and used throughout
  these lectures. \nFor dealing with cartesian tensors, the notation of Chapman and
  Milne, \nexplained in the first chapter of Chapman and Cowling's book The \nMathematical
  Theory of Non-Uniform Oases (C.U.P., 1939) is used; this \nconsists in printing
  tensors in sans serif type. \n\nThe following examples will suffice to show how
  vector and tensor \nequations are translated into coordinate notation. \n\na = b

  chance which I propose to deal with \nin these lectures are not specifically physical
  concepts but have \na much wider meaning and application. They are used, more or
  \nless vaguely, in everyday life. They appear, not only in all \nbranches of science,
  but also in history, psychology, philosophy, \nand theology ; everywhere with a
  different shade of meaning. \nIt would be far beyond my abilities to give an account
  of all \nthese usages, or to attempt an analysis of the exact significance \nof
  the words 'cause 5 and 'chance' in each of them. However, \nit is obvious that there
  must be a common feature in the use of \nthese notions, like the theme in a set
  of variations. Indeed, \ncause expresses the idea of necessity in the relation of
  events, \nwhile chance means just the opposite, complete randomness. \nNature, as
  well as human affairs, seems to be subject to both \nnecessity and accident. Yet
  even accident is not completely \narbitrary, for there are laws of chance, formulated
  in the mathe- \nmatical theory of probability, nor can the cause-effect relation
  \nbe used for predicting the future with certainty, as this would \nrequire a complete
  knowledge of the relevant circumstances, \npresent, past, or both together, which
  is not available. There \nseems to be a hopeless tangle of ideas. In fact, if you
  look \nthrough the literature on this problem you will find no satisfac- \ntory
  solution, no general agreement. Only in physics has a \nsystematic attempt been
  made to use the notions of cause and \nchance in a way free from contradictions.
  Physicists form their \nnotions through the interpretation of experiments. This
  method \nmay rightly be called Natural Philosophy, a word still used for \nphysics
  at the Scottish universities. In this sense I shall attempt \nto investigate the
  concepts of cause and chance in these lectures. \nMy material will be taken mainly
  from physics, but I shall try \nto regard it with the attitude of the philosopher,
  and I hope that \nthe results obtained will be of use wherever the concepts of \ncause
  and chance are applied. I know that such an attempt will \nnot find favour with
  some philosophers, who maintain that \n\n5131 \n\n\n\na INTRODUCTION \n\nscience
  teaches only a narrow aspect of the world, and one which \nis of no great importance
  to man's mind. It is toie that many \nscientists are not philosophically minded
  and have hitherto \nshown much skill and ingenuity but little wisdom. I need hardly
  \nto enlarge on this subject. The practical applications of science \nhave given
  us the means of a fuller and richer life, but also the \nmeans of destruction and
  devastation on a vast scale. Wise \nmen would have considered the consequences of
  their activities \nbefore starting on them ; scientists have failed to do so, and
  only \nrecently have they become conscious of their responsibilities to \nsociety.
  They have gained prestige as men of action, but they \nhave lost credit as philosophers.
  Yet history shows that science \nhas played a leading part in the development of
  human thought. \nIt has not only supplied raw material to philosophy by gathering
  \nfacts, but also evolved the fundamental concepts on how to deal \nwith them. It
  suffices to mention the Copernican system of the \nuniverse, and the Newtonian dynamics
  which sprang from it. \nThese originated the conceptions of space, time, matter,
  force, \nand motion for a long time to come, and had a mighty influence \non many
  philosophical systems. It has been said that the meta- \nphysics of any period is
  the offspring of the physics of the pre- \nceding period. If this is true, it puts
  us physicists under the \nobligation to explain our ideas in a not-too-technical
  language. \nThis is the purpose of the following lectures on a restricted \nthough
  important field. I have made an attempt to avoid \nmathematics entirely, but failed.
  It would have meant an un- \nbearable clumsiness of expression and loss of clarity.
  A way out \nwould have been the reduction of all higher mathematics to \nelementary
  methods in Euclidean style following the cele- \nbrated example of Newton's Principia.
  But this would even \nhave increased the clumsiness and destroyed what there is
  of \naesthetic appeal. I personally think that more than 200 years \nafter Newton
  there should be some progress in the assimilation of \nmathematics by those who
  are interested in natural philosophy. \nSo I shall use ordinary language and formulae
  in a suitable \nmixture; but I shall not give proofs of theorems (they are \ncollected
  in the Appendix). \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION 3 \n\nIn this way I hope to explain how physics
  may throw some \nlight on a problem which is not only important for abstract \nknowledge
  but also for the behaviour of man. An unrestricted \nbelief in causality leads necessarily
  to the idea that the world is \nan automaton of which we ourselves are only little
  cog-wheels. \nThis means materialistic determinism. It resembles very much \nthat
  religious determinism accepted by different creeds, where \nthe actions of men are
  believed to be determined from the \nbeginning by a ruling of God. I cannot enlarge
  on the difficulties \nto which this idea leads if considered from the standpoint
  of \nethical responsibility. The notion of divine predestination \nclashes with
  the notion of free will, in the same way as the \nassumption of an endless chain
  of natural causes. On the other \nhand, an unrestricted belief in chance is impossible,
  as it cannot \nbe denied that there are a great many regularities in the world ;
  \nhence there can be, at most, 'regulated accident'. One has to \npostulate laws
  of chance which assume the appearance of laws \nof nature or laws for human behaviour.
  Such a philosophy \nwould give ample space for free will, or even for the willed
  \nactions of gods and demons. In fact, all primitive polytheistic \nreligions seem
  to be based on such a conception of nature : things \nhappening in a haphazard way,
  except where some spirit inter- \nferes with a purpose. We reject to-day this demonologioal
  \nphilosophy, but admit chance into the realm of exact science. \nOur philosophy
  is dualistic in this respect ; nature is ruled by \nlaws of cause and laws of chance
  in a certain mixture. How is \nthis possible? Are there no logical contradictions?
  Can this \nmixture of ideas be cast into a consistent system in which all \nphenomena
  can be adequately described or explained ? What \ndo we mean by such an explanation
  if the feature of chance is \ninvolved ? What are the irreducible or metaphysical
  principles \ninyolved ? Is there any room in this system for free will or for \nthe
  interference of deity ? These and many other questions can \nbe asked. I shall try
  to answer some of them from the stand- \npoint of the physicist, others from my
  philosophical convictions \nwhich are not much more than common sense improved by
  \nSporadic reading. The statement, frequently made, that modern \n\n\n\n4 INTRODUCTION
  \n\nphysics has given up causality is entirely unfounded. Modem \nphysics, it is
  true, has given up or modified many traditional \nideas ; but it would cease to
  be a science if it had given up the \nsearch for the causes of phenomena. I found
  it necessary, \ntherefore, to formulate the different aspects of the fundamental
  \nnotions by giving definitions of terms which seem to me in agree- \nment with
  ordinary language. With the help of these concepts, \nI shall survey the development
  of physical thought, dwelling \nhere and there on special points of interest, and
  I shall try to \napply the results to philosophy in general. \n\n\n\nII \n\nCAUSALITY
  AND DETERMINISM \n\nTHE concept of causality is closely linked with that of determin-
  \nism, yet they seem to me not identical. Moreover, causality is \nused with several
  different shades of meaning. I shall try to dis- \nentangle these notions and eventually
  sum them up in definitions. \nThe cause-effect relation is used mainly in two ways
  ; I shall \nillustrate this by giving examples, partly from ordinary life, \npartly
  from science. Take these statements : \n\n* Overpopulation is the cause of India's
  poverty/ \n\n'The stability of British politics is caused by the institution \n\nof
  monarchy.' \n\n'Wars are caused by the economic conditions.' \n\n'There is no life
  on the moon because of the lack of an \n\natmosphere containing oxygen.' \n\n'Chemical
  reactions are caused by the affinity of molecules.' \n\nThe common feature to which
  I wish to draw your attention \nis the fact that these sentences state timeless
  relations. They \nsay that one thing or one situation A causes another J5, meaning
  \napparently that the existence of B depends on A, or that if A \nwere changed or
  absent, B would also be changed or absent. \nCompare these statements with the following
  : \n\n'The Indian famine of 1946 was caused by a bad harvest/ \n'The fall of Hitler
  was caused by the defeat of his armies.' \n' The American war of secession was caused
  by the economic \n\nsituation of the slave states/ \n\n'Life could develop on earth
  because of the formation of an \n\natmosphere containing oxygen/ \n\n' The destruction
  of Hiroshima was caused by the explosion \n\nof an atomic bomb/ \n\nIn these sentences
  one definite event A is regarded as the \ncause of another B ; both events are more
  or less fixed in space \nand time. I think that these two different shades of the
  cause- \neffect relation are both perfectly legitimate. The common factor \n\n\n\n6
  CAUSALITY AND DETERMINISM \n\nis the idea of dependence, which needs some Comment.
  This \nconcept of dependence is clear enough if the two things con- \nnected are
  concepts themselves, things of the mind, like two \nnumbers or two sets of numbers
  ; then dependence means what \nthe mathematician expresses by the word 'function'.
  This \nlogical dependence needs no further analysis (I even think it \ncannot be
  further analysed). But causality does not refer to \nlogical dependence ; it means
  dependence of real things of nature \non one another. The problem of what this means
  is not simple \nat all. Astrologers claim the dependence of the fate of human \nbeings
  on the constellations of stars. Scientists reject such state- \nments but why? Because
  science accepts only relations of \ndependence if they can be verified by observation
  and experi- \nment, and we are convinced that astrology has not stood this \ntest.
  Science insists on a criterion for dependence, namely \nrepetitive observation or
  experiment : either the things A and B \nrefer to phenomena, occurring repeatedly
  in Nature and being \nsufficiently similar for the aspect in question to be considered
  \nas identical; or repetition can be artificially produced by \nexperiment. \n\nObservation
  and experiment are crafts which are systemati- \ncally taught. Sometimes, by a genius,
  they are raised to the \nlevel of an art. There are rules to be observed: isolation
  of the \nsystem considered, restriction of the variable factors, varying \nof the
  conditions until the dependence of the effect on a single \nfactor becomes evident
  ; in many cases exact measurements and \ncomparison of figures are essential. The
  technique of handling \nthese figures is a craft in itself, in which the notions
  of chance \nand probability play a decisive part we shall return to this \nquestion
  at a later stage. So it looks as if science has a methodical \nway of finding causal
  relations without referring to any meta- \nphysical principle. But this is a deception.
  For no observation \nor experiment, however extended, can give more than a finite
  \nnumber of repetitions, and the statement of a law B depends on \nA always transcends
  experience. Yet this kind of state- \nment is made everywhere and all the time,
  and sometimes from \nscanty material. Philosophers call it Inference by Induction,
  \n\n\n\nCAUSALITY AND DETERMINISM 7 \n\nand have developed many a profound theory
  of it. I shall not \nenter into a discussion of these speculations. But I have to
  \nmake it clear why I distinguish this principle of induction from \ncausality.
  Induction allows one to generalize a number of observa- \ntions into a general rule
  : that night follows day and day follows \nnight, or that in spring the trees grow
  green leaves, are induc- \ntions, but they contain no causal relation, no statement
  of \ndependence. The method of inductive thinking is more general \nthan causal
  thinking ; it is used in everyday life as a matter of \ncourse, and it applies in
  science to the descriptive and experi- \nmental branches as well. But while everyday
  life has no definite \ncriterion for the validity of an induction and relies more
  or less \non intuition, science has worked out a code, or rule of craft, for \nits
  application. This code has been entirely successful, and I \nthink that is the only
  justification for it just as the rules of the \ncraft of classical music are only
  justified by full audiences and \napplause. Science and art are not so different
  as they appear. \nThe laws in the realms of truth and beauty are laid down by the
  \nmasters, who create eternal works. \n\nAbsolute values are ideals never reached.
  Yet I think that \nthe common effort of mankind has approached some ideals in \nquite
  a respectable way. I do not hesitate to call a man foolish \nif he rejects the teaching
  of experience because no logical proof \nis forthcoming, or because he does not
  know or does not accept \nthe rules of the scientific craft. You find such super-logical
  \npeople sporadically among pure mathematicians, theologians, \nand philosophers,
  while there are besides vast communities of \npeople ignoijant of or rejecting the
  rules of science, among them \nthe members of anti-vaccination societies and believers
  in \nastrology. It is useless to argue with them ; I cannot compel \nthem to accept
  the same criteria of valid induction in which I \nbelieve: the code of scientific
  rules. For there is no logical \nargument for doing so ; it is a question of faith.
  In this sense I \nam willing to call induction a metaphysical principle, namely
  \nsomething beyond physics. \n\nAfter this excursion, let us return to causality
  and its two \nways of application, one as a timeless relation of dependence, \n\n\n\n8
  CAUSALITY AND DETERMINISM \n\nthe other as a dependence of one event fixed in time
  and space \non another (see Appendix, 1). I think that the abstract, timeless \nmeaning
  of causality is the fundamental one. This becomes \nquite evident if one tries to
  use the term in connexion with a \nspecific case without implicit reference to the
  abstraction. For \nexample: The statement that a bad harvest was the cause of the
  \nIndian famine makes sense only if one has in mind the timeless \nstatement that
  bad harvests are causes of famines in general. \nI leave it to you to confirm this
  with the other examples I have \ngiven or with any more you may invent. If you drop
  this refer- \nence to a general rule, the connexion between two consecutive \nevents
  loses its character of causality, though it may still retain \nthe feature of perfect
  regularity, as in the sequence of day and \nnight. Another example is the time-table
  of a railway line. You \ncan predict with its help the arrival at King's Cross of
  the \n10 o'clock from Waverley ; but you can hardly say that the time- \ntable reveals
  a cause for this event. In other words, the law \nof the time-table is deterministic
  : You can predict future events \nfrom it, but the question 'why ? ' makes no sense.
  \n\nTherefore, I think one should not identify causality and \ndeterminism. The
  latter refers to rules which allow one to \npredict from the knowledge of an event
  A the occurrence of an \nevent B (and vice versa), but without the idea that there
  is a \nphysical timeless (and spaceless) link between all things of the \nkind A
  and all things of the kind J5. I prefer to use the ex- \npression 'causality' mainly
  for this timeless dependence. It is \nexactly what experimentalists and observers
  mean when they \ntrace a certain phenomenon to a certain cause by systematic \nvariation
  of conditions. The other application of the word to \ntwo events following one another
  is, however, in so common use \nthat it cannot be excluded. Therefore I suggest
  that it should be \nused also, but supplemented by some 'attributes' concerning
  \ntime and space. It is always assumed that the cause precedes the \neffect ; I
  propose to call this the principle of antecedence. Further, \nit is generally regarded
  as repugnant to assume a thing to cause an \neffect at a place where it is not present,
  or to which it cannot be \nJinked by other things ; I shall call this the principle
  of contiguity. \n\n\n\nCAUSALITY AND DETERMINISM 9 \n\nI shall now try to condense
  these considerations in a few \ndefinitions. \n\nDeterminism postulates that events
  at different times are \nconnected by laws in such a way that predictions of un-
  \nknown situations (past or future) can be made. \n\nBy this formulation religious
  predestination is excluded, since \nit assumes that the book of destiny is only
  open to God. \n\nCausality postulates that there are laws by which the occur- \nrence
  of an entity B of a certain class depends on the \noccurrence of an entity A of
  another class, where the word \n' entity ' means any physical object, phenomenon,
  situation, \nor event. A is called the cause, B the effect. \n\nIf causality refers
  to single events, the following attributes \nof causality must be considered : \n\nAntecedence
  postulates that the cause must be prior to, or at \n\nleast simultaneous with, the
  effect. \nContiguity postulates that cause and effect must be in spatial \n\ncontact
  or connected by a chain of intermediate things in \n\ncontact. \n\n\n\nIll \n\nILLUSTRATION:
  ASTRONOMY AND PARTICLE \nMECHANICS \n\nI SHALL now illustrate these definitions
  by surveying the \ndevelopment of physical science. But do not expect an ordinary
  \nhistorical treatment. I shall not describe how a great man \nactually made his
  discoveries, nor do I much care what he him- \nself said about it. I shall try to
  analyse the scientific situation \nat the time of the discovery, judged by a modern
  mind, and \ndescribe them in terms of the definitions given. \n\nLet us begin with
  the oldest science, astronomy. Pre- \nNewtonian theory of celestial motions is an
  excellent example \nof a mathematical and deterministic, yet not causal, description.
  \nThis holds for the Ptolemaic system as well as for the Copernican, \nincluding
  Kepler's refinements. Ptolemy represented the motion \nof the planets by kinematic
  models, cycles, and epicycles rolling \non one another and on the fixed heavenly
  sphere. Copernicus \nchanged the standpoint and made the sun the centre of cyclic
  \nplanetary motion, while Kepler replaced the cycles by ellipses. \nI do not wish
  to minimize the greatness of Copernicus' step in \nregard to the conception of the
  Universe. I just consider it from \nthe standpoint of the question which we are
  discussing. Neither \nPtolemy nor Copernicus nor Kepler states a cause for the be-
  \nhaviour of the planets, except the ultimate cause, the will of the \nCreator.
  What they do is, in modern mathematical language, \nthe establishment of functions,
  \n\n*i=/i(*), = /(*). \n\nfor the coordinates of all particles, depending on time.
  Coperni- \ncus himself claimed rightly that his functions, or more accurately \nthe
  corresponding geometrical structures, are very much simpler \nthan those of Ptolemy,
  but he refrained from advocating the \ncosmological consequences of his system.
  This question came \nto the foreground long after his death mainly by Galileo's
  tele- \nscopic observations, which revealed in Jupiter and his satellites \na repetition
  of the Copernican system on a smaller scale. \n\n\n\nILLUSTRATION: ASTRONOMY AND
  PARTICLE MECHANICS 11 \n\nDescartes's cosmology can be regarded as an early attempt
  to \nestablish causal laws for the planetary orbits by assuming a \ncomplicated
  vortex motion of some kind of ether, and it is \nremarkable that this construction
  satisfies contiguity. But it \nfailed because it lacked the main feature of scientific
  progress ; \nit was not based on a reasonable induction from facts. Of course, \nno
  code of rules existed, nor did Descartes's writings provide it \nat that time. The
  principles of the code accepted to-day are \nimplicitly contained in the works of
  Galileo and Newton, who \ndemonstrated them with their actual discoveries in physics
  and \nastronomy in the same way as Haydn established the rules of \nthe sonata by
  writing lovely music in this form. \n\nGalileo's work precedes Newton's not only
  in time but also \nin logical order ; for Galileo was experimenting with terrestrial
  \nobjects according to the rules of repetition and variation of con- \nditions,
  while Newton's astronomical material was purely obser- \nvational and restricted.
  Galileo observed how a falling body \nmoves, and studied the conditions on which
  the motion depends. \nHis results can be condensed into the well-known formula for
  the \nvertical coordinate of a small body or 'particle' as a function of \n\ntime
  > z = -fetf 2 , (3.1) \n\nwhere g is a constant, i.e. independent not only of time
  but also \nof the falling body. The only thing this quantity g can depend \nupon
  is the body towards which the motion is taking place, the \nearth a conclusion which
  is almost too obvious to be formu- \nlated ; for if the motion is checked by my
  hand, I feel the weight \nas a pressure directed downwards towards the earth. Hence
  the \nconstant g nlust be interpreted as a property of the earth, not of \nthe falling
  body. \n\nUsing Newton's calculus (denoting the time derivative by a \ndot) and
  generalizing for all three coordinates, one obtains the \nequations ^ Oj ^ = 0>
  z = -0, (3.2) \n\nwhich describe the trajectories of particles upon the earth with
  \narbitrary initial positions and velocities. \n\nThese formulae condense the description
  of an infinite number \nof orbits and motions in one single simple statement: that
  some \n\n\n\n12 ILLUSTRATION: ASTRONOMY AND PARTICLE MECHANICS \n\nproperty of the
  motion is the same for the whole class, indepen- \ndent of the individual case,
  therefore depending only on the one \nother thing involved, namely the earth. Hence
  this property, \nnamely the vertical acceleration, must be 'due to the earth', or
  \n'caused by the earth', or e a force exerted by the earth'. \n\nThis word 'force'
  indicates a specification of the general \nnotion of cause, namely a measurable
  cause, expressible in \nfigures. Apart from this refinement, Galileo's work is just
  a case \nof ordinary causality in the sense of my definition. \n\nYet the law (3.2)
  involves time, since the 'effect' of the force \nis an acceleration, the rate of
  change of velocity in time. This \nis the actual result of observation and measurement,
  and has no \nmetaphysical root whatsoever. A consequence of this fact is the \ndeterministic
  character of the law (3.2) : if the position and the \nvelocity of a particle are
  given at any time, the equations deter- \nmine its position and velocity at any
  other time. \n\nIn fact, any other time in the past or future. This shows that \nGalileo's
  law does not conform to the postulate of antecedence : \na given initial situation
  cannot be regarded as the cause of a \nlater situation, because the relation between
  them is completely \nsymmetrical; each determines the other. This is closely con-
  \nnected with the notion of time which Galileo used, and which \nNewton took care
  to define explicitly. \n\nThe postulate of contiguity is also violated by Galileo's
  law \nsince the action of the earth on the moving particle needs \napparently no
  contact. But this question is better discussed in \nconnexion with Newton's generalization.
  \n\nNewton applied Galileo's method to the explanation of celestial \nmotions. The
  material on which he based his deductions was \nscanty indeed; for at that time
  only six planets (including the \nearth) and a few satellites of these were known.
  I say 'deduc- \ntions', for the essential induction had already been made by \nKepler
  when he announced his three laws of planetary motion as \nvalid for planets in general.
  The first two laws, concerning the \nelliptic shape of the orbit and the increase
  of the area swept by \nthe radius vector, were based mainly on Tycho Brahe's observa-
  \ntions of Mars, i.e. of one single planet. Generalized by a sweeping \n\n\n\nILLUSTRATION:
  ASTRONOMY AND PARTICLE MECHANICS 13 \n\ninduction to any planet they are, according
  to Newton, equiva- \nlent to the statement that the acceleration is always directed
  \ntowards the sun and varies inversely as the square of the distance \nr from the
  sun, /zr~ 2 , where p, is a constant which may differ \nfrom planet to planet. But
  it is the third law which reveals the \ncausal relation to the sun. It says that
  the ratio of the square \nof the period and the cube of the principal axis is the
  same for \nall planets induced from data about the six known planets. \nThis implies,
  as Newton showed (see Appendix, 2), that the \nconstant p, is the same for all planets.
  Hence as in Galileo's case, \nit can depend only on the single other body involved,
  the sun. \nIn this way the interpretation is obtained that the centripetal, \nacceleration
  ju,r~ 2 is 'due to the sun', or 'caused by the sun', or \n'a force exerted by the
  sun'. \n\nThe moon and the other planetary satellites were then the \nmaterial for
  the induction which led to the generalization of a \nmutual attraction of all bodies
  towards one another. The most \namazing step, rightly admired by Newton's contemporaries
  and \nlater generations, was the inclusion of terrestrial bodies in the \nlaw derived
  from the heavens. This is in fact the idea symbolized \nby the apocryphal story
  of the falling apple : terrestrial gravity \nwas regarded by Newton as identical
  with celestial attraction. } \nBy applying his laws of motion to the system earth-moon,
  he \ncould calculate Galileo's constant of gravity g from geodetical \nand astronomical
  data : namely, \n\n\n\nwhere r is the* radius of the earth, R the distance between
  thei \ncentres of earth and moon, and T the time of revolution ofj \nthe moon (sidereal
  month). ! \n\nThe general equations for the motion of n particles under \nmutual
  gravitation read in modern vector notation \n\n\n\n(3.5) \n\n\n\nH ILLUSTRATION:
  ASTRONOMY AND PARTICLE MECHANICS \n\nwhere r a is the position vector of the particle
  a (a = 1, 2,..., n), \nr^p = |r a rp| the distance of two particles a and j3, V
  the \npotential of the gravitational forces. \n\nNewton also succeeded in generalizing
  the laws of motion for \nother non-gravitational forces by introducing the notion
  of mass, \nor more precisely of inertial mass. Newton's method of repre- \nsenting
  his results in an axiomatic form does not reveal the way \nhe obtained them. It
  is, however, possible to regard this step as \na case of ordinary causality derived
  by induction. One has to \nobserve the acceleration of different particles produced
  by the \nsame non-gravitational (say elastic) forces at the same point of \nspace
  ; they are found to differ, but not in direction, only in \nmagnitude. Therefore,
  one can infer by induction the existence \nof a scalar factor characteristic for
  the resistance of a particle \nagainst acceleration or its inertia. This factor
  is called 'mass'., \nIt may still depend on velocity as is assumed in modern theory
  \nof relativity. This can be checked by experiment, and as in \nNewton's time no
  such effect could be observed, the mass was \nregarded as a constant. \n\nThen the
  generalized equations of motions read \n\nw a r a = F a , (3.6) \n\nwhere m a (a
  = 1, 2,..., n) are the masses and F a the force vectors \nwhich depend on the mutual
  distances r^p of all the particles. \nAs in the case of gravitation, they may be
  derivable from a \npotential V by the operation \n\nF a =-grad a F, (3.7) \n\nwhere
  V is a function of the r^. The most general form of V for \nforces inverse to the
  square of the distance would be ( 2' means \n\na,p \n\nsumming over all a, /3 except
  a = /?) \n\n\n\nwhere n a p are constants; comparison with (3.4) and (3.5) shows,
  \nhowever, that these must have the form \n\nV>B = >W- ( 3 - ) \n\n\n\nILLUSTRATION:
  ASTRONOMY AND PARTICLE MECHANICS 15 \n\nNewton applies further a law of symmetry,
  stated axiomatic- \nally, namely that action equals reaction, or /Lt a p = /*0 a
  , from \n\nwhich follows \n\npp = Kmp, (3.10) \n\nwhere K is a universal constant,
  the constant of gravitation. \nHence the constants of attraction or gravitational
  masses /Z Q \nare proportional to the inertial masses m a . \n\nNeither Newton himself,
  nor many generations of physicists \nand astronomers after him have paid much attention
  to the law \nexpressed by (3.10). Astronomical observations left little doubt \nthat
  it was correct, and it was proved by terrestrial observations \n(with suitable pendulums)
  to hold with extreme accuracy \n(Eotvos and others). Two centuries went by before
  Einstein saw \nthe fundamental problem contained in the simple equation \n(3.10),
  and built on it the colossal structure of his theory of \ngeneral relativity, to
  which we have to return later. \n\nBut this is not our concern here. We have to
  examine \nNewton's equations from the standpoint of the principle of \ncausality.
  I hope I have made it clear that they imply the notion \nof cause exactly in the
  same sense as it is always used by the \nexperimentalist, namely signifying a verifiable
  dependence of \none thing or another. Yet this one thing is, in Galileo's and \nNewton's
  theory alike, a peculiar quantity, namely an accelera- \ntion. The peculiarity is
  not only that it cannot be seen or read \nfrom a measuring tape, but that it contains
  the time implicitly. \nIn fact, Newton's equations determine the motion of a system
  \nin time completely for any given initial state (position and \nvelocity of all
  particles involved). In this way, ' causation ' leads \nto ' determination ', not
  as a new metaphysical principle, but as a \nphysical fact, like any other. However,
  just as in Galileo's \nsimpler case, so here the relation between two consecutive
  con- \nfigurations of the system is mutual and symmetrical. This has a \nbearing
  on the question whether the principle of antecedence \nholds. As this applies, according
  to our definition, only to the \ncause-effect relation between single events, one
  has to change \nthe standpoint. Instead of considering the acceleration of one \nbody
  to be caused by the other bodies, one considers two \n\n\n\n16 ILLUSTRATION: ASTRONOMY
  AND PARTICLE MECHANICS \n\nconsecutive configurations of the whole system and asks
  whether \nit makes sense to call the earlier one the cause\" of the later one. \nBut
  it makes no sense, for the relation between the two states is \nsymmetrical. One
  could, with the same right, call the later \nconfiguration the cause of the earlier
  one. \n\nThe root of this symmetry is Newton's definition of time. \nWhatever he
  says about the notion of time (in Principia, \nScholium I) as a uniform flow, the
  use he makes of it contains \nnothing of a flow in one direction. Newton's time
  is just an \nindependent variable t appearing in the equations of motion, in \nsuch
  a way that if t is changed into t, the equations remain \nthe same. It follows that,
  if all velocities are reversed, the \nsystem just goes back the same way ; it is
  completely reversible. \n\nNewton's time variable is obviously an idealization abstracted
  \nfrom simple mechanical models and astronomical observations, \nfitting well into
  celestial motion, but not into ordinary experi- \nence. To us it appears that life
  on earth is going definitely in one \ndirection, from past to future, from birth
  to death, and the \nperception of time in our mind is that of an irresistible and
  \nirreversible current. \n\nAnother feature of Newton's dynamics was repugnant to
  \nmany of his contemporaries, in particular the followers of \nDescartes, whose
  cosmology, whatever else its shortcomings, \nsatisfied the principle of contiguity,
  as I have called the condition \nthat cause and effect should be in spatial contact.
  Newton's \nforces, the quantitative expressions for causes of motion, are sup- \nposed
  to act through empty space, so that cause and effect are \nsimultaneous whatever
  the distance. Newton himself refrained \nfrom entering into a metaphysical controversy
  and insisted that \nthe facts led unambiguously to his results. Indeed, the language
  \nof facts was so strong that they silenced the philosophical objec- \ntions, and
  only when new facts revealed to a later generation the \npropagation of forces with
  finite velocity, was the problem of \ncontiguity in gravitation taken up. In spite
  of these difficulties, \nNewton's dynamics has served many generations of physicists
  \nand is useful, even indispensable, to-day. \n\n\n\nIV \n\nCONTIGUITY \nMECHANICS
  OF CONTINUOUS MEDIA \n\nALTHOUGH I maintain that neither causality itself nor its
  \nattributes, which I called the principles of antecedence and \ncontiguity, are
  metaphysical, and that only the inference by \ninduction transcends experience,
  there is no doubt that these \nideas have a strong power over the human mind, and
  we have \nevidence enough that they have influenced the development of \nclassical
  physics. Much effort has been made to reconcile \nNewton's laws with these postulates.
  Contiguity is closely bound \nup with the introduction of contact forces, pressures,
  tensions, \nfirst in ordinary material bodies, then in the electromagnetic \nether,
  and thus to the idea of fields of forces ; but the systematic \napplication of contiguity
  to gravitation exploded Newton's \ntheory, which was superseded by Einstein's relativity.
  Similar \nwas the fate of the postulate of antecedence ; it is closely bound \nup
  with irreversibility in time, and found its first quantitative \nformulation in
  thermodynamics. The reconciliation of it with \nNewton's laws was attempted by atomistics
  and physical \nstatistics ; the idea being that accumulations of immense num- \nbers
  of invisible Newtonian particles, atoms, or molecules appear \nto the observer to
  have the feature of irreversibility for statistical \nreasons. The atoms were first
  hypothetical, but soon they were \ntaken seriously, and one began to search for
  them, with increas- \ning success. They became more and more real, and finally even
  \nvisible. And tlaen it turned out that they were no Newtonian \nparticles at all.
  Whereupon the whole classical physics exploded, \nto be replaced by quantum theory.
  Looked at from the point \nof view of our principles, the situation in quantum theory
  is \nreversed. Determinism (which is so prominent a characteristic \nof Newton's
  theory) is abandoned, but contiguity and ante- \ncedence (violated by Newton's laws)
  are preserved to a consider- \nable degree. Causality, which in my formulation is
  independent \nof antecedence and contiguity, is not affected by these changes :
  \n\n5131 \n\n\n\n18 CONTIGUITY \n\nscientific work will always be the search for
  causal interdepen- \ndence of phenomena. a \n\nAfter this summary of the following
  discussion, let us return to \nthe question why violation of the principles of contiguity
  and ante- \ncedence in Newton's theory was first accepted though not with- \nout
  protest but later amended and finally rejected. This change \nwas due to the transition
  from celestial to terrestrial mechanics. \n\nThe success of Newton's theory was
  mainly in the field of \nplanetary motion, and there it was overwhelming indeed.
  It is \nnot my purpose to expand on the history of astronomy after \nNewton ; it
  suffices to remember that the power of analytical \nmechanics to describe and predict
  accurately the observations \nled many to the conviction that it was the final formulation
  of \nthe ultimate laws of nature. \n\nThe main attention was paid to the mathematical
  investiga- \ntion of the equations of motion, and the works of Lagrange, \nLaplace,
  Gauss, Hamilton, and many others are a lasting \nmemorial of this epoch. Of all
  these writings, I shall dwell only \nfor a moment on that of Hamilton, because his
  formulation of \nNewton's laws is the most general and elegant one, and because
  \nthey will be used over and over again in the following lectures. \nSo permit me
  a short mathematical interlude which has nothing \ndirectly to do with cause and
  chance. \n\nHamilton considers a system of particles described by any \n(in general
  non- Cartesian) coordinates #1, #2v> then the poten- \ntial energy is a function
  of these, V(q l9 J 2 > ) r shortly F(#), and \nthe kinetic energy T a function of
  both the coordinates and the \ngeneralized velocities q v q%,..., T(q, q). He then
  defines general- \nized momenta m \n\n\n\nand regards the total energy T+ V as a
  function of the # a and p a . \nThis function T+V = H(q, p) (4.2) \n\nis to-day
  called the Hamiltonian. \n\nThe equations of motion assume the simple 'canonical'
  form \n\n\n\nCONTIGUITY 19 \n\nfrom which one reads at once the conservation law
  of energy, \n\n^ = 0, H = const. (4.4) \n\nat \n\nIt is this set of formulae which
  has survived the most violent \nrevolution of physical ideas which has ever taken
  place, the \ntransition to quantum mechanics. \n\nReturning now to the post-Newtonian
  period there was, \nsimultaneous with the astronomical applications and confirma-
  \ntions of the theory, a lively interest in applying it to ordinary \nterrestrial
  physics. Even here Newton had shown the way and \nhad calculated, for instance,
  the velocity of sound in a fluid. \nEventually the mechanics of elastic solids brought
  about a \nmodification of Newton's definition of force which satisfies con- \ntiguity.
  Much of this work is due to the great mathematician \nCauchy. He started, as many
  before him, by treating a solid as \nan aggregate of tiny particles, acting on one
  another with \nNewtonian non-contiguous forces of short range anticipating \nto
  some degree the modern atomistic standpoint. But there was \nof course, at that
  time, no evidence of the physical reality of \nthese particles. In the physical
  applications all traces of them \nwere obliterated by averaging. The form of these
  results sug- \ngested to Cauchy another method of approach where particle \nmechanics
  is completely discarded. Matter is considered to be a \nreal continuum in the mathematical
  sense, so that it has a \nmeaning to speak of a force between two pieces of matter
  \nseparated by a surface. This seems to be, from our modern \nstandpoint, a step
  in the wrong direction, as we know matter \nto be discontinuous. But Cauchy 's work
  showed how con- \ntiguity could be introduced into mechanics ; the importance of
  \nthis point became evident when the new method was applied to \nthe ether, the
  carrier of light and of electric and magnetic forces, \nwhich even to-day is still
  regarded as continuous though it has \nlost most of the characteristic properties
  of a substance and can \nhardly be called a continuous medium. \n\nIn this theory
  all laws appear in the form of partial differential \nequations, in which the three
  space-coordinates appear together \nwith the time as independent coordinates. \n\n\n\n20
  CONTIGUITY \n\nI shall give a short sketch of the mechanics of continuous \nmedia.
  \n\nMass, velocity, and all other properties of matter are con- \nsidered continuously
  distributed in space. The mass per unit \nvolume or density p is then a function
  of the space coordinates, \nand the same holds for the current of mass u = pv (namely
  the \nquantity of mass passing through a surface per unit area and \nunit time).
  The conservation (indestructibility) of mass then \nleads to the so-called continuity
  equation (see Appendix, 3) \n\np+div u = 0. (4.5) \n\nConcerning the forces, one
  has to assume that, if the sub- \nstance is regarded as separated into two parts
  by a surface, each \npart exerts a push or pull through this surface on the other
  which, \nmeasured per unit area, is called tension or stress. A simple \nmathematical
  consideration, based on the equilibrium conditions \nfor the resultant forces acting
  on the surfaces of a volume \nelement, shows that it suffices to define these tension
  forces for \nthree non-coplanar surface elements, say those parallel to the \nthree
  coordinate planes; the force on the element normal to x \nbeing T x with components
  T xx ,T xy ,T xz) the other two forces \ncorrespondingly T y (T yx , T yy , T yz
  ) and T s (T zx , T zy) T m ). Then the \nforce on a surface element with the normal
  unit vector \n\nn ( n x> n y> n z) \n\nis given by T n = T x n x +T y n y +T e n
  z . (4.6) \n\nApplication of the law of moments to a small volume element \nshows
  (see Appendix, 3) that \n\nm _. 7? m__/p /77__/TT /4/7\\ \n\n*yz -*0y> *zx J -xz'>

  to a volume element then leads to the \nequations \n\n(4.9) \n\n\n\n\nCONTIGUITY
  21 \n\nwhere div T is a vector with the components \n\n\n\nand d/dt the operator
  \n\n\n\nwhich is called the 'convective derivative'. \n\n(4.9) together with (4.5)
  are the new equations of motion \nwhich satisfy the postulate of contiguity. They
  are the proto- \ntype for all subsequent field theories. In the present form they
  \nare still incomplete and rather void of meaning, as the stress \ntensor is not
  specified in its dependence on the physical condi- \ntions of the system just in
  the same way as Newton's equations \nare void of meaning if the forces are not specified
  with their \ndependence on the configuration of the particles. The configura- \ntion
  of a continuous system cannot be described by the values \nof a finite number of
  variables, but by certain space functions, \ncalled ' strain-components'. They are
  defined in this way: \nA small (infinitesimal) volume of initially spherical shape
  will be \ntransformed by the deformation into an ellipsoid ; the equation \nof this
  has the form \n\ne n x 2 +e 22 y 2 +e 39 z 2 +2e^yz+2e 31 zx+2e u xy = e, (4.12)
  \n\nwhere e is an (infinitesimal) constant, measuring the absolute \ndimensions,
  and e n , e 22 ,..., e 12 are six quantities depending on \nthe position x, y, z
  of the centre of the sphere. These e^ are the \ncomponents of the strain tensor
  e. \n\nIn the thegry of elasticity it is assumed that the stress com- \nponents
  Ty are linear functions of the strain components e^ \n(Hooke's law). \n\nIn hydrodynamics
  the relation between T and e involves \nspace- and time-derivatives of e^. In plastic
  solids the situation \nis still more complicated. \n\nWe need not enter into these
  different branches of the \nmechanics in continuous media. The only important point
  for \nus is this : Contact forces spread not instantaneously but with \nfinite velocity.
  This is the main feature distinguishing Cauchy's' \n\n\n\n22 CONTIGUITY \n\ncontiguous
  mechanics from Newton's non-contiguous. The \nsimplest example is an elastic fluid
  (liquid or' gas). Here the \nstress tensor T has only diagonal elements which are
  equal and \nrepresent the pressure p. The configuration can also be described \nby
  one variable, the density p or, for a given mass, the volume V. \nThe relation between
  p and F may be any function # =/(F) we \nshall have to remember this later when
  we have to deal with \nthermodynamics. For small disturbances of equilibrium the
  \ngeneral equations reduce to linear ones ; any quantity </> in an \nisotropic fluid
  (change of volume or pressure) satisfies the linear \nwave equation , Q2 ^ \n\nig-*
  (4.1.) \n\nwhere A is Laplace's differential operator \n\n' ++*;. (4.14) \n\n\n\nand
  c a constant which is easily found to mean the phase \nvelocity of a plane harmonic
  wave \n\n2*77 \n\n<f> == A sin (# ct). \nA \n\nThe equation (4.13) links up mechanics
  with other branches \nof physics which have independently developed, optics and
  \nelectromagnetism. \n\nELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS \n\nThe history of optics, in particular
  Newton's contributions \nand his dispute with Huygens about the corpuscular or wave
  \nnature of light, is so well known that I need not speak about it. \nA hundred
  years after Newton, the wave nature of light was \nestablished by Young and Fresnel
  with the help of experiments \non diffraction and interference. Wave equations of
  the type \n(4.13) were used as a matter of course to describe the observa- \ntions,
  where now <f> means the amplitude of the vibration. \n\nBut what is it that vibrates
  ? A name, 'ether/ was ready to \nhand, and its ability to propagate transverse waves
  suggested \nthat it was comparable to an elastic solid. In this way it came \nto
  pass that the ether-filled vacuum was the carrier of contact \n\n\n\nCONTIGUITY
  23 \n\nforces, spreading with finite velocity. They existed for a long \nperiod
  peacefully beside Newton's instantaneous forces of \ngravitation, and other similar
  forces introduced to describe \nelementary experiences in electricity and magnetism.
  These \nforces are usually connected with Coulomb's name, who verified \nthem by
  direct measurements of the intensity of attraction and \nrepulsion between small
  charged bodies, and between the \npoles of needle-shaped magnets. He found a law
  of the same \ntype as that of Newton, of the form //r~ 2 , where the constant p
  \ndepends on the state of electrification or magnetization respec- \ntively of the
  interacting particles; by applying the law of \naction and reaction p can be split
  into factors, /x = e l e 2 in the \nelectric case, where e v e z are called the
  charges. It must, \nhowever, have been remarked that this law was already \nestablished
  earlier and with a higher degree of accuracy by \nCavendish and Priestley by an
  indirect reasoning, with the help \nof the fact that a closed conductor screens
  a charged particle \nfrom the influence of outside charges; this argument, though
  still \ndressed up in the language of Newtonian forces, is already quite \nclose
  to notions of field theory. \n\nIt was the attempt to formulate the mechanical interactions
  j \nbetween linear currents (in thin wires) in terms of Newtonian f \nforces which
  entangled physics in the first part of the nineteenth \ncentury in serious difficulties.
  Meanwhile Faraday had begun / \nhis investigations unbiased by any mathematical
  theory, and \naccumulated direct evidence for understanding electric and \nmagnetic
  phenomena with the help of contact forces. He spoke \nabout pressures and tensions
  in the media surrounding charged \nbodies, using the expressions introduced in the
  theory of elas- \nticity, yet with considerable and somewhat strange modifica- \ntions.
  Indeed, the strangeness of these assumptions made it \ndifficult for his learned
  contemporaries to accept his ideas and \nto discard the well-established Newtonian
  fashion of descrip- \ntion. Yet seen from our modern standpoint, there is no intrinsic
  \ndifference between the two methods, as long as only static and \nstationary phenomena
  are considered. Mathematical analysis \nshows that the resultant forces on observable
  bodies can be \n\n\n\n24 CONTIGUITY \n\nexpressed either as integrals over elementary
  contributions of \nthe Newtonian or better Coulombian type acting over the \ndistance,
  or by surface integrals of tensions derived from field \nequations. This holds not
  only for conductors in vacuo, but also \nfor dielectric and magnetizable substances
  ; it is true that in the \nlatter case the Coulombian forces lead to integral equations
  \nwhich are somewhat involved, but the differential equations of \nthe field are,
  in spite of their simpler aspect, not intrinsically \nsimpler. This is often overlooked
  in modern text-books. How- \never, in Faraday's time this equivalence of differential
  and \nintegral equations for the forces was not known, and if it had \nbeen, Faraday
  would not have cared. His conviction of the \nsuperiority of contact forces over
  Coulombian forces rested on \nhis physical intuition. It needed another, more mathematically-
  \nminded genius, Clerk Maxwell, to find the clue which made it \nimpossible to accept
  forces acting instantaneously over finite \ndistances: the finite velocity of propagation.
  It is not easy to \nanalyse exactly the epistemological and experimental founda-
  \ntions of Maxwell's prediction, as his first papers make use of \nrather weird
  models and the purity of his thought appears only \nin his later publications. I
  think the process which led to Max- \nwell's equations, stripped of all unnecessary
  verbiage and round- \nabout ways, was this : By combining all the known experimental
  \nfacts about charges, magnetic poles, currents, and the forces \nbetween them,
  he could establish a set of field equations con- \nnecting the spatial and temporal
  changes of the electric and \nmagnetic field strength (force per unit charge) with
  the electric \ncharge density and current. But if these were combined with \nthe
  condition that any change of charge could occur only by \nmeans of a current (expressed
  by a continuity equation analo- \ngous to (4.5) ; see Appendix, 4), an inadequacy
  became obvious. \nIn the language of that time, the result was formulated by \nsaying
  that no open currents (like discharge of condensers) \n<3ould be described by this
  theory. Therefore something was \nwrong in the equations, and an inspection showed
  a suspicious \nfeature, a lack of symmetry. The terms expressing Faraday's \ninduction
  law (production of electric force by the time variation \n\n\n\nCONTIGUITY 25 \n\nof
  the magnetic field) had no counterpart obtained by exchanging \nthe symbols for
  electric and magnetic quantities (production of \nmagnetic force by the time variation
  of the electric field). With- \nout any direct experimental evidence Maxwell postulated
  this \ninverse effect and added to his equations the corresponding \nterm, which
  expresses that a change of the electric field (dis- \nplacement current) is, in
  its magnetic action, equivalent to an \nordinary current. It was a guess based on
  a belief in harmony. \nYet by some mathematical reasoning it can be connected with
  \none single but highly significant fact which sufficed to convince \nMaxwell of
  the correctness of his conjecture just as Newton \nwas convinced of the correctness
  of his law of gravitation by one \nsingle numerical coincidence, the calculation
  of terrestrial; \ngravity from the moon's orbit. Maxwell showed that his modified
  \nequations had solutions representing waves, the velocity, c, of \nwhich could
  be expressed in terms of purely electric and magnetic \nconstants ; for the vacuum
  c turned out to be equal to the ratio \nof a unit of charge measured electrostatically
  (by Coulomb's \nlaw) and electromagnetically (by Oersted's law). This ratio, a \nquantity
  of the dimensions of a velocity, was known from \nmeasurements by Kohlrausch and
  Weber, and its numerical \nvalue coincided with the velocity of light. That could
  hardly \nbe accidental, indeed, and Maxwell could pronounce the electro- \nmagnetic
  theory of light. \n\nThe final confirmation of Maxwell's theory was, after his \ndeath,
  obtained by Hertz's discovery of electromagnetic waves, \n\nI cannot follow the
  further course of events in the establish- \nment of electromagnetic theory. I only
  wish to stress the point \nthat the use of contact forces and field equations, i.e.
  the \nestablishment of contiguity, in electromagnetism was the result \nof a long
  struggle against preconceptions of Newtonian origin. \nThis confirms my view that
  the question of contiguity is not a \nmetaphysical one, but an empirical one. \n\nWe
  have now to see whether the laws of electromagnetism \nsatisfy the principle of
  antecedence. An inspection of Maxwell's \nequations (see Appendix, 4) shows that
  a reversal of time, \n-> t, leaves everything, including the continuity equation,
  \n\n\n\n26 CONTIGUITY \n\nunchanged, if the electric density and field are kept
  unchanged \nwhile the electric current and magnetic field are reversed. This \nis
  a kind of reversibility very similar to that of mechanics, \nwhere a change of the
  sign of all velocities makes the system \nreturn to its initial state. The difference
  is only a practical one : \na change of sign of all current densities and the whole
  magnetic \nfield is not as simple to perform as that of a finite set of velocities.
  \nThe situation is best seen by considering an electromagnetic \nwave spreading
  from a point source ; the corresponding solution \nof Maxwell's equation is given
  by so-called retarded potentials \nwhich express the electromagnetic state at a
  point P for the time \nt in terms of the motion of the source at the time tr/c,
  where r \nis the distance of P from the source. But there also exist other \nsolutions,
  advanced potentials, which refer to the later time \nt+r/c and represent a wave
  contracting towards the source. \n\nSuch contracting waves are of course necessary
  for solving \ncertain problems. Imagine, for instance, a spherical wave \nreflected
  by a concentric spherical mirror. However, such a \nmirror must be absolutely perfect
  to do its duty, and there \nappears to be something improbable about the occurrence
  of \nadvanced potentials in nature. For the description of ele- \nmentary processes
  of emission of atoms or electrons one has \nsupplemented Maxwell's equations by
  the rule that only retarded \nsolutions are allowed. In this way a kind of irreversibility
  can \n|be introduced and the principle of antecedence satisfied. But \n'this is
  altogether artificial and unsatisfactory. The irreversi- \nbility of actual electromagnetic
  processes has its roots in other \nfectsL which we shall later have to describe
  in detail. Maxwell's \nequations themselves do not satisfy the postulate of antecedence.
  \n\nRELATIVITY AND THE FIELD THEORY OF GRAVITATION \nThe situation which we have
  now reached is that which I \nfound when I began to study almost half a century
  ago. There \nexisted, more or less peacefully side by side, Newton's mechanics \nof
  instantaneous action over any distance, Cauchy's mechanics \nof continuous substances,
  and Maxwell's electrodynamics, the \nlatter two satisfying the postulate of contiguity
  . Of these theories, \n\n\n\nCONTIGUITY 27 \n\nMaxwell's seemed to be the most promising
  and fertile, and the \nidea began to spread that possibly all forces of nature might
  be of \nelectromagnetic origin. The problem had to be envisaged, how to \nreconcile
  Newton's gravitational forces with the postulate of con- \ntiguity ; the solution
  was Einstein's general theory of relativity. \n\nThis is a long and interesting
  story by itself which involves \nnot only the notion of cause with which we are
  concerned here, \nbut other philosophical concepts, namely those concerned with
  \nspace and time. A detailed discussion of these problems would \nlead us too far
  away from our subject, and I think it hardly \nnecessary to dwell on them because
  relativity is to-day widely \nknown and part of the syllabus of the student of mathematics
  \nand physics as well. So I shall give a very short outline only. \n\nThe physical
  problems which led to the theory of relativity \nwere those concerned with the optical
  and electromagnetic \nphenomena of fast-moving bodies. There are two types of \nexperiments
  : those using the high velocity of celestial bodies \n(e.g. Michelson's and Morley's
  experiment) and those using fast \nelectrons or ions (e.g. Bucherer's measurement
  of the mass of \nelectrons in cathode rays as a function of the velocity) . The
  work \nof Lorentz, FitzGerald, Poincar6, and others prepared the ground \nfor Einstein's
  discovery that the root of all difficulties was the \nassumption of a universal
  time valid for all moving systems of \nreference. He showed that this assumption
  has no foundation \nin any possible experience and he replaced it by a simple defini-
  \ntion of relative time, valid in a given coordinate system, but \ndifferent from
  the time of another system in relative motion. \nThe formal lajv of transformation
  from one space-time system \nto another was already known, owing to an analysis
  of Lorentz ; \nit is in fact an intrinsic property of Maxwell's equations. The,
  \nLorentz transformation is linear; it expresses the physical \nequivalence of systems
  in relative motion with constant velocity \n(see Appendix, 5). \n\nEinstein's theory
  of gravitation is formally based on a general- \nization of these transformations
  into arbitrary, non-linear ones ; \nwith the help of these one can express the transition
  from one \nsystem of reference to another accelerated (and simultaneously \n\n\n\n28
  CONTIGUITY \n\ndeformed) one. The physical idea behind this mathematical \nformalism
  has been already mentioned: the exact proportion- \nality of mass, as defined by
  inertia, and of mass as defined by \ngravitation, equation (3.10); or, in other
  words, the fact that \nin Newton's law of gravitational motion (3.4) the (inertial)
  mass \ndoes not appear. \n\nEinstein succeeded in establishing equations for the
  gravita- \ntional field by identifying the components of this field with the \nquantities
  g^ v which define the geometry of space -time, namely \nthe coefficients of the
  line element \n\n(4.15) \n\n\n\np,v \n\nwhere x l 9 # 2 , x 3 stand for the space
  coordinates x, y, z, x* for the \ntime t. \n\nIn ordinary 3-dimensional Euclidean
  geometry the g^ v are \nconstant and can, by a proper choice of the coordinate system,
  \nbe normalized in such a way that \n\n9w= *> ^ v = 0for/x ^v. \n\nMinkowski showed
  that special relativity can be regarded as \na 4-dimensional geometry, where time
  is added as the fourth \ncoordinate, but still with constant g^ v , which can be
  normalized to \n\n11 = 022 = 033= l > 044=- 1 > fy, = for /* =5* V. (4.16) \n\nIt
  was further known from the work of Riemann that a very \ngeneral type of non-Euclidean
  geometry in 3-dimensional space \ncould be obtained by taking the gr as variable
  functions of \nx l , x z , # 3 , and the mathematical properties of this geometry
  had \nbeen thoroughly studied (Levi-Civita, Eicci). \n\nEinstein generalized Eiemann's
  formalism to four dimensions, \nassuming that the g^ v depend not only on x l ,x
  2 ,x* 9 but also on \nx 4 , the time. However, he regarded the g^ v not as given
  functions \nof x l , # 2 , # 3 , # 4 but as field quantities to be calculated from
  the \ndistribution of matter. He formed a set of quantities R^ v which \ncan be
  regarded as a measure of the * curvature' of space and are \nfunctions of the g^
  v and their first and second derivatives, and \npostulated equations of the form
  \n\nR^ - fcZ;,, (4.17) \n\n\n\nCONTIGUITY 29 \n\nwhere K is a constant and the T^
  v are generalizations of the \ntensions in matter, defined in (4.8): one has to
  supplement the \ntensor T by a fourth row and column, where T U ,T 2 ^T U are \nthe
  components of the density of momentum, T u the density of \nenergy. These equations
  (4.17) are invariant in a very general \nsense, namely for all continuous transformations
  of space-time, \nand they are essentially uniquely determined by this property \nand
  the postulate that no higher derivatives than the second- \norder ones should appear.
  \n\nIf the distribution of matter is given, i.e. the T^ v are known, \nthe field
  equations (4.17) allow one to calculate the g v , i.e. the \ngeometry of space.
  Einstein found the solution for a mass point \nas source of the field, and by assuming
  that the motion of another \nparticle was determined by a geodesic, or shortest,
  or straightest \nline in this geometry, he showed that Newton's laws of planetary
  \nmotion follow as a first approximation. But higher approxima- \ntions lead to
  small deviations, some of which can be observed. \nI cannot enter into the discussion
  of all the consequences of the \nnew gravitational theory ; Einstein's predictions
  have been con- \nfirmed, although some of them are at the limit of observational
  \ntechnique. But I wish to add a remark about a theoretical point \nwhich is not
  so well known, yet very important. The assump- \ntion that the motion of a particle
  is given by a geodesic is \nobviously an unsatisfactory feature ; one would expect
  that the \nfield equations alone should determine not only the field pro- \nduced
  by particles but also the reaction of the particles to the \nfield, that is their
  motion. Einstein, with his collaborators \nInfeld and Hoffmann, has proved that
  this is in fact the case, \nand the same result has been obtained independently
  and, as I \nthink, in a considerably simpler way, by the Russian physicist,. \nPock.
  On the basis of these admirable papers, one can say that! \nthe field theory of
  gravitatien is logically perfect whether it? \nwill stand all observational tests
  remains to be seen. * \n\nFrom the standpoint of the philosophical problem, which
  is \nthe subject of these lectures, there are several conclusions to be \ndrawn.
  The first is that now physical geometry, that is, not some \nabstract mathematical
  system but the geometrical aspect of the \n\n\n\n30 CONTIGUITY \n\nbehaviour of
  actual bodies, is subject to the cause-effect relation \nand to all related principles
  like any other btanch of science. \nThe mathematicians often stress the opposite
  point of view ; \nthey speak of the geometrization of physics, but though it cannot
  \nbe denied that the mathematical beauty of this method has \ninspired numerous
  valuable investigations, it seems to me an \nover-estimation of the formalism. The
  main point is that \nEinstein's geometrical mechanics or mechanical geometry \nsatisfies
  the principle of contiguity. On the other hand, ante- \ncedence, applied to two
  consecutive configurations as cause and \neffect, is not satisfied, or not more
  than in electrodynamics ; for \nthere is no intrinsic direction in the flow of time
  contained in \nthe equations. The theory is deterministic, at least in principle
  : \nthe future or past motion of particles and the distribution of the \ngravitational
  field are predictable from the equations, if the \nsituation at a given time is
  known, together with boundary \nconditions (vanishing of field at infinity) for
  all times. But as \nthe gravitational field travels between the particles with finite
  \nvelocity, this statement is not identical with Newtonian deter- \nminism : a knowledge
  is needed, not only of all particles, but also \nof all gravitational waves (which
  do not exist in Newton's \ntheory). Einstein himself values the deterministic feature
  of his \ntheory very highly. He regards it as a postulate which has to \nbe demanded
  from any physical theory, and he rejects, there- \nfore, parts of modern physics
  which do not satisfy it. \n\nHere I only wish to remark that determinism in field
  theories \nseems to me of very little significance. To illustrate the power \nof
  mechanics, Laplace invented a super-mathematician able to \npredict the future of
  the world provided the positions and veloci- \nties of all particles at one moment
  were given to him. I can \nsympathize with him in his arduous task. But I would
  really \npity him if he had not only to solve the numerous ordinary \ndifferential
  equations of Newtonian type but also the partial \ndifferential equations of the
  field theory with the particles as \nsingularities. \n\n\n\nANTECEDENCE: THERMODYNAMICS
  \n\nWE have now to discuss the experiences which make it possible \nto distinguish
  in an objective empirical way between past and \nfuture or, in our terminology,
  to establish the principle of \nantecedence in the chain of cause and effect. These
  experiences \nare connected with the production and transfer of heat. There \nwould
  be a long story to tell about the preliminary steps \nnecessary to translate the
  subjective phenomena of hot and cold \ninto the objective language of physics :
  the distinction between \nthe quality 'temperature' and the quantity 'heat', together
  \nwith the invention of the corresponding instruments, the ther- \nmometer and calorimeter.
  I take the technical side of this \ndevelopment to be well known and I shall use
  the thermal \nconcepts in the usual way, although I shall have to analyse them \npresently
  from the standpoint of scientific methodology. It was \nonly natural that the measurable
  quantity heat was first \nregarded as a kind of invisible substance called caloric.
  The \nflow of heat was treated with the methods developed for material \nliquids,
  yet with one important difference : the inertia of the \ncaloric fluid seemed to
  be negligible; its flow was determined \nby a differential equation which is not
  of the second but of the \nfirst order in time. It is obtained from the continuity
  equation \n(see (4.5)) (J+divq = (5.1) \n\nby assuming that the change of the density
  of heat Q is propor- \ntional to the change of temperature T, SQ = c 8T (where c
  is the \nspecific heat), while the current of heat q is proportional to the \nnegative
  gradient of temperature, q = K grad T (where K is \nthe coefficient of conductivity).
  Hence \n\nfiT \n\nc^- = K *T, (5.2) \n\ndt \n\na differential equation of the first
  order in time. This equa- \ntion was the starting-point of one of the greatest discoveries
  \nin mathematics, Fourier's theory of expansion of arbitrary \n\n\n\n32 ANTECEDENCE:
  THERMODYNAMICS \n\nfunctions in terms of orthogonal sets of simple periodic functions,
  \nthe prototype of numerous similar expansions and the embryo \nfrom which a considerable
  part of modern analysis and mathe- \nmatical physics developed. \n\nBut that is
  not the aspect from which we have here to regard \nthe equation (5.2) ; it is this:
  \n\nThe equation does not allow a change of t into t, the result \ncannot be compensated
  by a change of sign of other variables \nas happens in Maxwell's equations. Hence
  the solutions exhibit \nan essential difference of past and future, a definite 'flow
  of time' \nas one is used to say meaning, of course, a flow of events in \ntime.
  For instance, an elementary solution of (5.2) for the \ntemperature distribution
  in a thin wire along the ^-direction is \n\n\n\n, (5.3) \n\nwhich describes the
  spreading and levelling out of an initially \nhigh temperature concentrated near
  the point x = 0, an \nobviously irreversible phenomenon. \n\nI do not know enough
  of the history of physics to understand \nhow this theory of heat conduction was
  reconciled with the \ngeneral conviction that the ultimate laws of physics were
  of the \nNewtonian reversible type. \n\nBefore a solution of this problem could
  be attempted another \nimportant step was necessary : the discovery of the equivalence
  \nof heat and mechanical work, or, as we say to-day, of the first \nlaw of thermodynamics.
  It is important to remember that this \ndiscovery was made considerably later than
  the invention of the \nsteam-engine. Not only the production of heat by mechanical
  \nwork (e.g. through friction), but also the production of work \nfrom heat (steam-engine)
  was known. The new feature was the \nstatement that a given amount of heat always
  corresponds to a \ndefinite amount of mechanical work, its 'mechanical equivalent'.
  \nRobert Mayer pronounced this law on very scanty and indirect \nevidence, but obtained
  a fairly good value for the equivalent \nfrom known properties of gases, namely
  from the difference of \nheat necessary to raise the temperature by one degree if
  either \n\n\n\nANTECEDENCE: THERMODYNAMICS 33 \n\nthe volume is kept constant or
  the gas allowed to do work \nagainst a constant pressure. Joule investigated the
  same \nproblem by systematic experiments which proved the essential \npoint, namely
  that the work necessary to transfer a system from \none equilibrium state to another
  depends only on these two \nstates, not on the process of application of the work.
  This is the \nreal content of the first law ; the determination of the numerical
  \nvalue of the mechanical equivalent, so much stressed in text- \nbooks, is a matter
  of physical technique. To get our notions \nclear, we have now to return to the
  logical and philosophical \nfoundations of the theory of heat. \n\nThe problem is
  to transform the subjective sense impressions \nof hot and cold into objective measurable
  statements. The latter \nare, of course, again somewhere connected with sense impres-
  \nsions. You cannot read an instrument without looking at it. \nBut there is a difference
  between this looking at, say, a thermo- \nmeter with which a nurse measures the
  temperature of a patient \nand the feeling of being hot under which the patient
  suffers. \n\nIt is a general principle of science to rid itself as much as \npossible
  from sense qualities. This is often misunderstood as \nmeaning elimination of sense
  impressions, which, of course, is \nabsurd. Science is based on observation, hence
  on the use of the \nsenses. The problem is to eliminate the subjective features
  and \nto maintain only statements which can be confirmed by several \nindividuals
  in an objective way. It is impossible to explain to \nanybody what I mean by saying
  'This thing is red' or 'This \nthing is hot'. The most I can do is to find out whether
  other \npersons call the same things red or hot. Science aims at a closer \nrelation
  between word and fact. Its method consists in finding \ncorrelations of one kind
  of subjective sense impressions with \nother kinds, using the one as indicators
  for the other, and in this \nway establishes what is called a fact of observation.
  \n\nHere I have ventured again into metaphysics. At least, a \nphilosopher would
  claim that a thorough study of these \nmethodological principles is beyond physics.
  I think it is again \na rule of our craft as scientists, like the principle of inductive
  \ninference, and I shall not analyse it further at this moment. \n\n6181 \n\n\n\nJJ4
  ANTECEDENCE: THERMODYNAMICS \n\nIn the case of thermal phenomena, the problem is
  to define \nthe quantities involved temperature, heat by means of \nobservable objective
  changes in material bodies. It turns out \nthat the concepts of mechanics, configuration
  and force, strain \nand stress, suffice for this purpose, but that the laws of mechanics
  \nhave to be essentially changed. \n\nLet us consider for simplicity only systems
  of fluids, that is of \ncontinuous media, whose state in equilibrium is defined
  by one \nsingle strain quantity, the density, instead of which we can also, \nfor
  a given mass, take the total volume V. There is also only one \nstress quantity,
  the pressure p. From the standpoint of \nmechanics the pressure in equilibrium is
  a given function of the \nvolume, p = f(V). \n\nNow all those experiences which
  are connected with the \nsubjective impression of making the fluid hotter or colder,
  show \nthat this law of mechanics is wrong : the pressure can be changed \nat constant
  volume namely 'by heating' or 'by cooling'. \n\nHence the pressure p can be regarded
  as an independent \nvariable besides the volume V, and this is exactly what thermo-
  \ndynamics does. \n\nThe generalization for more complicated substances (such as
  \nthose with rigidity or magnetic polarizability) is so obvious that \nI shall stick
  to the examples of fluids, characterized by two \nthermodynamically independent
  variables V,p. But it is \nnecessary to consider systems consisting of several fluids,
  and \ntherefore one has to say a word about different kinds of contact \nbetween
  them. \n\nTo shorten the expression, one introduces the idea of 'walls' \nseparating
  different fluids. These walls are supposed to be so \nthin that they play no other
  part in the physical behaviour of \nthe system than to define the interaction between
  two neigh- \nbouring fluids. We shall assume every wall to be impenetrable \nto
  matter, although in theoretical chemistry semi-permeable \npartitions are used with
  great advantage. Two kinds of walls \nare to be considered. \n\nAn adiabatic wall
  is defined by the property that equilibrium \nof a body enclosed by it is not disturbed
  by any external process \n\n\n\nANTECEDENCE: THERMODYNAMICS 35 \n\nas long as no
  part of the wall is moved (distance forces being \nexcluded in the whole consideration).
  \n\nTwo comments have to be made. The first is that the \nadiabatic property is
  here defined without using the notion of \nheat ; that is essential, for as it is
  our aim to define the thermal \nconcepts in mechanical terms, we cannot use them
  in the ele- \nmentary definitions. The second remark is that adiabatic \nenclosure
  of a system can be practically realized, as in the Dewar \nvessel or thermos flask,
  with a high degree of approximation. \nWithout this fact, thermodynamics would be
  utterly im- \npracticable. \n\nThe ordinary presentations of this subject, though
  rather \ncareless in their definitions, cannot avoid the assumption of the \npossibility
  of isolating a system thermally; without this no \ncalorimeter would work and heat
  could not be measured. \n\nThe second type of wall is the diathermanous wall, defined
  by \nthe following property : if two bodies are separated by a diather- \nmanous
  wall, they are not in equilibrium for arbitrary values of \ntheir variables p^V^
  and p 2 ,V 2 , but only if a definite relation \nbetween these four quantities is
  satisfied \n\nF(Pi ,Vi,PVt) = 0. (5.4) \n\nThis is the expression of thermal contact;
  the wall is only intro- \nduced to symbolize the impossibility of exchange of material.
  \n\nThe concept of temperature is based on the experience that \ntwo bodies, being
  in thermal equilibrium with a third one, are \nalso in thermal equilibrium with
  another. If we write (5.4) in \nthe short form JF(1, 2) = 0, this property of equilibrium
  can be \nexpressed by saying that of the three equations \n\nF(2, 3) = 0, J(3, 1)
  = 0, JP(1, 2) = 0, (5.5) \n\nany two always involve the third. This is only possible
  if \n(5.4) can be brought into the form \n\n\n\nNow one can use one of the two bodies,
  say 2, as thermometer \nand introduce the value of the function \n\nI) = * (5.7)
  \n\n\n\n36 ANTECEDENCE: THERMODYNAMICS \n\nas empirical temperature. Then one has
  for the other body the \nso-called equation of state \n\n\n\nAny arbitrary function
  of & can be chosen as empirical tem- \nperature with equal right; the choice is
  restricted only by \npractical considerations. (It would be impractical to use a
  ther- \nmometric substance for which two distinguishable states are in \nthermal
  equilibrium.) The curves & = const, in thep F-plane are \nindependent of the temperature
  scale ; they are called isotherms. \n\nIt is not superfluous to stress the extreme
  arbitrariness of the \ntemperature scale. Any suitable property of any substance
  can \nbe chosen as thermometric indicator, and if this is done, still \nthe scale
  remains at our disposal. If we, for example, choose a \ngas at low pressures, because
  of the simplicity of the isothermal \ncompression law p V = const., there is no
  reason to take p V = # \nas measure of temperature: one could just as well take
  (pV) 2 or \n*J(p F). The definition of an ' absolute ' scale of temperature was
  \ntherefore an urgent problem which was solved by the discovery \nof the second
  law of thermodynamics. \n\nThe second fundamental concept of thermodynamics, that
  of \nheat, can be defined in terms of mechanical quantities by a \nproper interpretation
  of Joule's experiments. As I have pointed \nout already, the gist of these experiments
  lies in the following \nfact : If a body in an adiabatic enclosure is brought from
  one \n(equilibrium) state to another by applying external work, the \namount of
  this work is always the same in whatever form \n(mechanical, electrical, etc.) and
  manner (slow or fast, etc.) it is \napplied. \n\nHence for a given initial state
  (p Q) V ) the work done adia- \nbatically is a function U of the final state (p,
  F), and one can \n\nwrite W=U-U ; (5.9) \n\nthe function U(p, V) is called the energy
  of the system. It is a \nquantity directly measurable by mechanical methods. \n\nIf
  we now consider a non-adiabatic process leading from the \ninitial state (p Q ,
  V Q ) to the final state (p, F), the difference \nJJ-. ^_ jy w iU not be zero, but
  cian be determined if the energy \n\n\n\nANTECEDENCE: THERMODYNAMICS 37 \n\nfunction
  U(p, V) is known from previous experiment. This \ndifference n __ ^_ w = Q (g JQ)
  \n\nis called the heat supplied to the system during the process. \nEquation (5.10)
  is the definition of heat in terms of mechanical \nquantities. \n\nThis procedure
  presupposes that mechanical work is measur- \nable however it is applied ; that
  means, for example, that the \ndisplacements of and the forces on the surface of
  a stirring- \nwheel in a fluid, or the current and resistance of a wire heating
  \nthe fluid, must be registered even for the most violent reactions. \nPractically
  this is difficult, and one uses either stationary pro- \ncesses of a comparatively
  long duration where the irregular \ninitial and final stages can be neglected (this
  includes heating \nby a stationary current), or extremely slow, 'quasi-static* \nprocesses
  ; these are in general (practically) reversible, since no \nkinetic energy is produced
  which could be irreversibly destroyed \nby friction. In ordinary thermodynamics
  one regards every \ncurve in the p F-plane as the diagram of a reversible process
  ; \nthat means that one allows infinitely slow heating or cooling by \nbringing
  the system into thermal contact with a series of large \nheat reservoirs which differ
  by small amounts of temperature. \nSuch an assumption is artificial; it does not
  even remotely \ncorrespond to a real experiment. It is also quite superfluous. \nWe
  can restrict ourselves to adiabatic quasi -static processes, \nconsisting of slow
  movements of the (adiabatic) walls. For these \nthe work done on a simple fluid
  is \n\ndW = -pdV, (5.11) \n\nwhere p is the equilibrium pressure, and the first
  theorem of \nthermodynamics (5.10) assumes the form \n\ndQ = dU+pdV = 0. (5.12)
  \n\nFor systems of fluids separated by adiabatic or diathermanous \nwalls the energy
  and the work done are additive (according to \nour definition of the walls) ; hence,
  for instance, \n\ndQ = dQi+dQt = dU+pidTi+ptdTi, (5.13) \n\nwhere U = Z7i+Z7 2 .
  \n\n\n\n58 ANTECEDENCE: THERMODYNAMICS \n\nThis equation is of course only of interest
  for the case of \nthermal contact where the equation (5.6) holds ; the system has
  \nthen only three independent variables, for which one can choose \nV l9 V 2 and
  the temperature #, defined by (5.7) and (5.8). Then \n, #), U 2 = t/ 2 (F 2 , #),
  and (5.13) takes the form \n\n\n\n(5.14) \n\nEvery adiabatic quasi-static process
  can be represented as a \nline in the three-dimensional I^tf-space which satisfies
  this \nequation; let us call these for brevity * adiabatic lines'. \n\nEquation
  (5.14) is a differential equation of a type studied by \nPfaif. Pfaffian equations
  are the mathematical expression of \nelementary thermal experiences, and one would
  expect that the \nlaws of thermodynamics are connected with their properties. \nThat
  is indeed the case, as Carath(5odory has shown. But \nclassical thermodynamics proceeded
  in quite a different way, \nintroducing the conception of idealized thermal machines
  which \ntransform heat into work and vice versa (William Thomson \nLord Kelvin),
  or which pump heat from one reservoir into \nanother (Clausius). The second law
  of thermodynamics is then \nderived from the assumption that not all processes of
  this kind \nare possible : you cannot transform heat completely into work, \nnor
  bring it from a state of lower temperature to one of higher \n'without compensation'
  (see Appendix, 6). These are new and \nstrange conceptions, obviously borrowed from
  engineering. \nI have mentioned that the steam-engine existed before thermo- \ndynamics;
  it was a matter of course at that time to use the \nnotions and experiences of the
  engineer to obtain the laws of \nheat transformation, and the establishment of the
  abstract \nconcepts of entropy and absolute temperature by this method \nis a wonderful
  achievement. It would be ridiculous to feel any- \nthing but admiration for the
  men who invented these methods. \nBut even as a student, I thought that they deviated
  too much \nfrom the ordinary methods of physics ; I discussed the problem \nwith
  my mathematical friend, Caratheodory, with the result \nthat he analysed it and
  produced a much more satisfactory \n\n\n\nANTECEDENCE: THERMODYNAMICS 39 \n\nsolution.
  This was about forty years ago, but still all text- \nbooks reproduce the * classical'
  method, and I am almost certain \nthat the same holds for the great majority of
  lectures I know, \nhowever, a few exceptions, namely those of the late R. H. Fowler
  \nand his school. This state of affairs seems to me one of unhealthy \nconservatism.
  I take in these lectures an opportunity to advo- \ncate a change. \n\nThe central
  point of Caratheodory's method is this. The \nprinciples from which Kelvin and Clausius
  derived the second \nlaw are formulated in such a way as to cover the greatest \npossible
  range of processes incapable of execution: in no way \nwhatever can heat be completely
  transformed into work or \nraised to a higher level of temperature. Caratheodoiy
  remarked \nthat it is perfectly sufficient to know the existence of some \nimpossible
  processes to derive the second law. I need hardly \nsay that this is a logical advantage.
  Moreover, the impossible \nprocesses are already obtained by scrutinizing Joule's
  experi- \nments a little more carefully. They consisted in bringing a \nsystem in
  an adiabatic enclosure from one equilibrium state to \nanother by doing external
  work : it is an elementary experience, \nalmost obvious, that you cannot get your
  work back by reversing \nthe process. And that holds however near the two states
  are. \nOne can therefore say that there exist adiabatically inaccessible \nstates
  in any vicinity of a given state. That is Caratheodory's \nprinciple. \n\nIn particular,
  there are neighbour states of any given \none which are inaccessible by quasi-static
  adiabatic processes. \nThese are represented by adiabatic lines satisfying the \nPfaffian
  equation (5.14). Therefore the question arises: Does \nCarath^odory's postulate
  hold for any Pfaffian or does it mean \na restriction ? \n\nThe latter is the case,
  and it can be seen by very simple \nmathematics indeed, of which I shall give here
  a short sketch \n(see Appendix, 7). \n\nLet us first consider a Pfaffian equation
  of two variables, \nx and y, \n\n(5.15) \n\n\n\n40 ANTECEDENCE: THERMODYNAMICS \n\nwhere
  X, T are functions of x 9 y. This is equivalent to the \nordinary differential equation
  \n\n2-7- \n\nwhich has an infinite number of solutions <l>(x,y) = const., \nrepresenting
  a one-parameter set of curves in the (#,t/)-plane. \nAlong any of these curves one
  has \n\n\n\n. . \n\nand this must be the same condition rfs the given Pfaffian;
  \n\nhence one must have jr\\ \\ n /* io\\ \n\naty = A dtp. (5.18) \n\nEach Pfaffian
  dQ of two variables has therefore an 'integrating \ndenominator' A, so that dQ/X
  is a total differential. \nFor Pfaffians of three (or more) variables, \n\ndQ =
  Xdx+Tdy+Zdz (5.19) \n\nthis does not hold. It is easy to give analytical examples
  (see \nAppendix, 7) ; but one can see it geometrically in this way: if in \n(5.19)
  dx > dy, dz are regarded as finite differences #, T? y, 2, \nit is the equation
  of a plane through the point x,y,z\\ one has a \nplane through each point of space,
  continuously varying in \norientation with the position of this point. Now if a
  function <j> \nexisted, these planes would have to be tangential to the surfaces
  \n<f>(x, y, z) = const. But one can construct continuously varying \nsets of planes
  which are not 'integrable', i.e. tangential to a set \nof surfaces. For example,
  take all circular screws with the same \naxis, but varying radius and pitch, and
  construct at each point \nof every screw the normal plane ; these obviously form
  a non- \nintegrable set of planes. \n\nHence all Pfaffians can be separated into
  two classes : those of \nthe form dQ = Ad^, which have an 'integrating denominator'
  \nand represent the tangential planes of a set of surfaces ^ = const., \nand those
  which lack this property. \n\nNow in the first case, dQ = Xd$ y any line satisfying
  the \nPfaffian equation (5.19) must lie in the surface < = const. \nHence an arbitrary
  pair of points P and P in the #t/z-space \n\n\n\nANTECEDENCE: THERMODYNAMICS 41
  \n\ncannot be connected by such a line. This is quite elementary. \nNot quite so
  obvious is the inverse statement which is used in the \nthermodynamic application:
  If there are points P in any \nvicinity of a given point P which cannot be connected
  with P \nby a line satisfying the Pfaffian equation (5.19), then there \nexists
  an integrating denominator and one has dQ = Xd<f>. \n\nOne can intuitively understand
  this theorem by a continuity \nconsideration : All points P inaccessible from P
  will fill a certain \nvolume, bound by a surface of accessible points going through
  P . \nFurther, to each inaccessible point there corresponds another \none in the
  opposite direction ; hence the boundary surface must \ncontain all accessible points
  : which proves the existence of the \nfunction </>, so that dQ = \\d<f> (see Appendix,
  7). \n\nThe application of this theorem to thermodynamics is now \nsimple. Combining
  it with Carath^odory's principle, one has for \nany two systems \n\ndQi = A^, dQt
  = A 2 cty 2 , (5.20) \nand for the combined system \n\ndQ = dQt+dQi = Xdfa (5.21)
  \n\nhence Xd<f> = ^ &</>!+ X 2 d<f> 2 . (5.22) \n\nConsider in particular two simple
  fluids in thermal contact; \nthen the system has three independent variables T^,
  T,#, which \ncan be replaced by </> l9 (f) 2y &. Then (5.22) shows that <f> depends
  \nonly on ^ x , < 2 , and not on #, while \n\n\n\n=5 ^ \n\nd<f>i A d<f>2 A \n\nHence
  these quotients are also independent of #, \n\n8 h-o _?_^_o \ne A ~ ' a* A ' \n\nfrom
  which one infers \n\n1 8\\ _ I aA _ 1 8X \n\nAj 8& ~ A 2 8& ~ X 8&' ^ ' ' \n\nNow
  \\ is a variable of the first fluid only, therefore only \n\n\n\n42 ANTECEDENCE:
  THERMODYNAMICS \n\ndependent on < x and #; in the same way A 2 = A 2 (</> 2 ,#).
  The \nfirst equality (5.24) can only hold if both quantities depend only \non #.
  Hence \n\n\n\n___ _ _____ _ __ \n\nwhere g(&) is a universal function, namely numerically
  identical \nfor different fluids and for the combined system. \n\nThis simple consideration
  leads with ordinary mathematics \nto the existence of a universal function of temperature.
  The rest \nis just a matter of normalization. From (5.25) one finds for each \nsystem
  \n\nlogA = J g() d#+logd>, A = Oef **> d , (5.26) \n\nwhere <I> depends on the corresponding
  <f>. \nIf one now defines \n\nT(&) \n\n(5.27) \n\n\n\nwhere the constant C can be
  fixed by prescribing the value of \nT 1 T 2 for two reproducible states of some
  normal substance \n(e.g. T l T 2 = 100, if 2i corresponds to the boiling-point,
  T 2 \nthe freezing-point of water at 1 atmosphere of pressure), then \none has dQ
  = Xd</> = TdS. (5.28) \n\nT is the thermodynamical or absolute temperature and 8
  the \nentropy. \n\nEquation (5.28) refers only to quasi-static processes, that \nis,
  to sequences of equilibrium states. To get a result about \nreal dynamical phenomena
  one has to apply Carath6odory's \nprinciple again, considering a finite transition
  from an initial \nstate FJ, F, 8 to a final state V lt V 2 , 8. One can reach the
  latter \none in two steps: first changing the volume quasi-statically \n(and adiabatically
  ) from FJ, VI to V I9 V 2 , the entropy remaining \nconstant, equal to &, and then
  changing the state adiabatically, \nbut irreversibly (by stirring, etc.) at constant
  volume, so that \nS goes over into S. \n\nNow if any neighbouring value S of 8 could
  be reached in \nthis way, one would have a contradiction to Carath^odory's \n\n\n\nANTECEDENCE:
  THERMODYNAMICS 43 \n\nprinciple, as the volumes are of course arbitrarily changeable.
  \nHence for each such process one must have either 8 ^ $ or \nS < $. Continuity
  demands that the same sign holds for all \ninitial states; it holds also for different
  substances since the \nentropy is additive (as can be easily seen). The actual sign
  ^ \nor ^ depends on the choice of the constant C in (5.27); if this is \nchosen
  so that T is positive, a single experience, say with a gas, \nshows that entropy
  never decreases. \n\nIt may not be superfluous to add a remark on the behaviour
  \nof entropy for the case of conduction of heat. As thermo- \ndynamics has to do
  only with processes where the initial and \nfinal states are equilibria, stationary
  flow cannot be treated : one \ncan only ask, What is the final state of two initially
  separated \nbodies brought into thermal contact ? The difficulty is that a \nchange
  of entropy is only defined by quasi-static adiabatic \nprocesses ; the sudden change
  of thermal isolation into contact, \nhowever, is discontinuous and the processes
  inside the system \nnot controllable. Yet one can reduce this process to the one
  \nconsidered before. By quasi-static adiabatic changes of volume \nthe temperatures
  can be made equal without change of entropy ; \nthen contact can be made without
  discontinuity, and the initial \nvolumes quasi -statically restored, again without
  a change of \nentropy. The situation is now the same as in the initial state \nconsidered
  before, and it follows that any process leading to the \nfinal state must increase
  the entropy. \n\nThe whole chain of considerations can be generalized for more \ncomplicated
  systems without any difficulty. One has only to \nassume that all independent variables
  except one are of the type \nrepresented by the volume, namely arbitrarily changeable.
  \n\nIf one has to deal, as in chemistry, with substances which are \nmixtures of
  different components, one can regard the concentra- \ntions of these as arbitrarily
  variable with the help of semi- \npermeable walls and movable pistons (see Appendix,
  8). \n\nBy using thermodynamics a vast amount of knowledge has \nbeen accumulated
  not only in physics but in the borderland \nsciences of physico-chemistry, metallurgy,
  mineralogy, etc. Most \nof it refers to equilibria. In fact, the expression ' thermodynamics
  ' \n\n\n\n44 ANTECEDENCE: THERMODYNAMICS \n\nis misleading. The only dynamical statements
  possible are \nconcerned with the irreversible transitions from one equilibrium
  \nstate to another, and they are of a very modest character, giving \nthe total
  increase of entropy or the decrease of free energy \nF = UTS. The irreversible process
  itself is outside the scope \nof thermodynamics. \n\nj^s The principle of antecedence
  is now satisfied ; but this gain is \npaid for by the loss of all details of description
  which ordinary \ndynamics of continuous media supplies. \n\nCan this not be mended?
  Why not apply the methods of \nCauchy to thermal processes, by treating each volume
  element \nas a small thermodynamical system, and regarding not only \nstrain, stress,
  and energy, but also temperature and entropy as \ncontinuous functions in space
  ? This has of course been done, \nbut with limited success. The reason is that thermodynamics
  is \ndefinitely connected with walls or enclosures. We have used the \nadiabatic
  and diathermanous variety, and mentioned semi- \npermeable walls necessary for chemical
  separations; but a \nvolume element is not surrounded by a wall, it is in free contact
  \nwith its neighbourhood. The thermodynamic change to which \nit is subject depends
  therefore on the flux of energy and material \nconstituents through its boundary,
  which themselves cannot be \nreduced to mechanics. In some limiting cases, one has
  found \nsimple solutions. For instance, when calculating the velocity of \nsound
  in a gas, one tried first for the relation between pressure \np and density p the
  isothermal law p = cp where c is a constant, \nbut found no agreement with experiment
  ; then one took the \nadiabatic law p = cp? where y is the ratio of the specific
  heats at \nconstant pressure and constant volume (see Appendix, 9), which \ngave
  a much better result. The reason is that for fast vibrations \nthere is no time
  for heat to flow through the boundary of a \nvolume element which therefore behaves
  as if it were adiabati- \ncally enclosed. But by making the vibrations slower and
  slower, \none certainly gets into a region where this assumption does not \nhold
  any more. Then conduction of heat must be taken into \naccount. The hydrodynamical
  equations and those of heat con- \nduction have to be regarded as a simultaneous
  system. In this \n\n\n\nANTECEDENCE: THERMODYNAMICS 45 \n\nway a descriptive or
  phenomenological theory can be developed \nand has been developed. Yet I am unable
  to give an account of \nit, as I have never studied it; nor have the majority of
  physicists \nshown much interest in this kind of thing. One knows that any \nflux
  of matter and energy can be fitted into Cauchy's general \nscheme, and there is
  not much interest in doing it in the most \ngeneral way. Besides, each effect needs
  separate constants \ne.g. in liquids compressibility, specific heat, conductivity
  of heat, \nconstants of diffusion ; in solids elastic constants and parameters \ndescribing
  plastic flow, etc., and very often these so-called con- \nstants turn out to be
  not constants, but to depend on other \nquantities (see Appendix, 10). \n\nTherefore
  one can rightly say that with ordinary thermo- \ndynamics the descriptive method
  of physics has come to its \nnatural end. Something new had to appear. \n\n\n\nVI
  \n\nCHANCE \nKINETIC THEORY OF GASES \n\nTHE new turn in physics was the introduction
  of atomistics and \nstatistics. \n\nTo follow up the history of atomistics into
  the remote past is \nnot in the plan of this lecture. We can take it for granted
  that \nsince the days of Demokritos the hypothesis of matter being \ncomposed of
  ultimate and indivisible particles was familiar to \nevery educated man. It was
  revived when the time was ripe. \nLord Kelvin quotes frequently a Father Boscovich
  as one of the \nfirst to use atomistic considerations to solve physical problems
  ; \nhe lived in the eighteenth century, and there may have been \nothers, of whom
  I know nothing, thinking on the same lines. \nThe first systematic use of atomistics
  was made in chemistry, \nwhere it allowed the reduction of innumerable substances
  to a \nrelatively small stock of elements. Physics followed considerably \nlater
  because atomistics as such was of no great use without \nanother fundamental idea,
  namely that the observable properties \nof matter are not intrinsic qualities of
  its smallest parts, but \naverages over distributions governed by the laws of chance.
  \n\nThe theory of probability itself, which expresses these laws, is \nmuch older;
  it sprang not from the needs of natural science but from \ngambling and other, more
  or less disreputable, human activities. \n\nThe first use of probability considerations
  in science was made \nby Gauss in his theory of experimental errors. I can suppose
  \nthat every scientist knows the outlines of it, yet I have to dwell \nupon it for
  a few moments because of its fundamental and \nsomewhat paradoxical aspect. It has
  a direct bearing on the \nmethod of inference by induction which is the backbone
  of all \nhuman experience. I have said that in my opinion the signifi- \ncance of
  this method in science consists in the establishment of a \ncode of rules which
  form the constitution of science itself. Now \nthe curious situation arises that
  this code of rules, which ensures \nthe possibility of scientific laws, in particular
  of the cause-effect \n\n\n\nKINETIC THEORY OF GASES 47 \n\nrelation, contains besides
  many other prescriptions those related \nto observational errors, a branch of the
  theory of probability. \nThis shows that the conception of chance enters into the
  very \nfirst steps of scientific activity, in virtue of the fact that no \nobservation
  is absolutely correct. I think chance is a more \nfundamental conception than causality
  ; for whether in a con- \ncrete case a cause-effect relation holds or not can only
  be judged \nby applying the laws of chance to the observations. \n\nThe history
  of science reveals a strong tendency to forget this. \nWhen a scientific theory
  is firmly established and confirmed, it \nchanges its character and becomes a part
  of the metaphysical \nbackground of the age: a doctrine is transformed into a dogma.
  \nIn fact no scientific doctrine has more than a probability value \nand is open
  to modification in the light of new experience. \n\nAfter this general remark, let
  us return to the question how \nthe notion of chance and probability entered physics
  itself. \n\nAs early as 1738 Daniel Bernoulli suggested the interpretation \nof
  gas pressure as the effect of the impact of numerous particles \non the wall of
  the container. The actual development of the \nkinetic theory of gases was, however,
  accomplished much later, \nin the nineteenth century. \n\nThe object of the theory
  was to explain the mechanical and \nthermodynamical properties of gas from the average
  behaviour \nof the molecules. For this purpose a statistical hypothesis was \nmade,
  often called the 'principle of molecular chaos': for an \n* ideal' gas in a closed
  vessel and in absence of external forces all \npositions and all directions of velocity
  of the molecules are \nequally probable. \n\nApplied to a monatomic gas (the atoms
  are supposed to be \nmass points), this leads at once to a relation between volume
  F, \npressure #, and mean energy U (see Appendix, 11) \n\nVp = 1*7, (6.1) \n\nif
  the pressure p is interpreted as the total momentum trans- \nferred to the wall
  by the impact of the molecules. One has now \nonly to assume that the energy U is
  a measure of temperature \nto obtain Boyle's law of the isotherms. Then it follows
  from \n\n\n\n48 CHANCE \n\nthermodynamics that U is proportional to the absolute
  tempera- \nture (see Appendix, 9) ; one has \n\nU = IRT, pV = RT, (6.2) \n\n\n\nwhere
  R is the ordinary gas constant. This is the complete \nequation of state (combined
  Boyle-Charles law), and one sees \nthat the specific heat of a monatomic gas for
  constant volume \nis p. \n\nI have mentioned these things only to stress the point
  that the \nkinetic theory right from the beginning produced verifiable \nnumerical
  results in abundance. There could be no doubt that \nit was right, but what did
  it really mean ? \n\nHow is it possible that probability considerations can be \nsuperimposed
  upon the deterministic laws of mechanics without \na clash ? \n\nThese laws connect
  the state at a time t to the initial state, \nat time , by definite equations. They
  involve, however, no \nrestriction on the initial state. This has to be determined
  by \nobservation in every concrete case. But observations are not \nabsolutely accurate;
  the results of measurements will suffer \nscattering according to Gauss's rules
  of experimental errors. In \nthe case of gas molecules, the situation is extreme
  ; for owing \nto the smallness and excessive number of the molecules, there is \nalmost
  perfect ignorance of the initial state. \n\nThe only facts known are the geometrical
  restriction of the \nposition of each molecule by the walls of the vessel, and some
  \nphysical quantities of a crude nature, like the resultant pressure \nand the total
  energy : very little indeed in view of the number of \nmolecules (about 10 19 per
  c.c.). \n\nHence it is legitimate to apply probability considerations to \nthe initial
  state, for instance the hypothesis of molecular chaos. \nThe statistical behaviour
  of any future state is then completely \ndetermined by the laws of mechanics. This
  is in particular the \ncase for 'statistical equilibrium ', when the observable
  properties \nare independent of time ; in this case any later state must have \nthe
  same statistical properties as the initial state (e.g. it must \nalso satisfy the
  condition of molecular chaos). How can this be \n\n\n\nKINETIC THEORY OF GASES 49
  \n\nmathematically formulated ? It is convenient to use the equa- \ntions of motion
  in Hamilton's canonical form (4.3, p. 18). The \ndistribution is described by a
  function/(, q lt # 2 ,..., j w , Pi,p&.-., p n ) \nof all coordinates and momenta,
  and of time, such that fdpdq \nis the probability for finding the system at time
  t in a given \nelement dpdq = dp^...dp n dq^...dq n . One can interpret this \nfunction
  as the density of a fluid in a 2ft-dimensional ^?g-space, \ncalled 'phase space';
  and, as no particles are supposed to dis- \nappear or to be generated, this fluid
  must satisfy a continuity \nequation, of the kind (4.5, p. 20), generalized for
  2n dimensions, \nnamely (see Appendix, 3) \n\n\n\n(63) \n\n8 Pk I \n\nThis reduces
  in virtue of the canonical equations (4.3), p. 18, \n\ntO f.f \n\n|-[#,/] = 0, (6.4)
  \n\nwhere [#,/] is an abbreviation, the so-called Poisson bracket, \n\nnamely (66)
  \n\n(6 ' 5) \n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the convective derivative defined for three
  \ndimensions in (4.11, p. 21) may be generalized for 2n dimensions \n\nthus: (6
  . 6) \n\n( ' \n\n\n\ndt 8t \nThen (6.4) says that in virtue of the mechanical equations
  \n\nf=0. (6.7) \n\nat \n\nThe result expressed by the equivalent equations (6.4)
  and \n(6.7) is called Liouville's theorem. The density function is an \nintegral
  of the canonical equations, i.e. / = const, along any \ntrajectory in phase space;
  in other words, the substance of the \nfluid is carried along by the motion in phase
  space, so that the \n\nI=jfdpdq (6.8) \n\n\n\nSIM \n\n\n\n60 CHANCE \n\nover any
  part of the substance moving in phase space is inde- \npendent of time. \n\nAny
  admissible distribution function, namely one for which \nthe probabilities of a
  configuration at different times are com- \npatible with the deterministic laws
  of mechanics, must be an \nintegral of motion, satisfying the partial differential
  equation \n(6.4). For a closed system, i.e. one which is free from external \ndisturbances
  (like a gas in a solid vessel), H is explicitly inde- \npendent of time. The special
  case of statistical equilibrium \ncorresponds to certain time-independent solutions
  of (6.4), i.e. \nfunctions / satisfying ^^j = (o) \n\nAn obvious integral of this
  equation is / = O(T), where <I> indi- \ncates an arbitrary function. This case plays
  a prominent part \nin statistical mechanics. \n\nYet before continuing with these
  very general considerations \nwe had better return to the ideal gases and consider
  the kinetic \ntheory in more detail. In an ideal gas, the particles (atoms, \nmolecules)
  are supposed to move independently of one another. \nHence the function f(p, q)
  is a product of N functions /(x, J-,) \neach belonging to a single particle and
  all formally identical; \nx is the position vector and \\ = ( l/m)p the velocity
  vector. Then \nfdxd% is the probability of finding a particle at time t at a specified
  \nelement of volume and velocity. \n\nIn the case where no external forces are present
  (dH/dt = 0, \ndH/dx = 0) the Hamiltonian reduces to the kinetic energy, \n\nH =
  |m| 2 = (l/2m)p 2 . \n\nThe hypothesis of molecular chaos is expressed by assuming
  /to \nbe a function of | 2 alone. This is indeed a solution of (6.9), as it \ncan
  be written in the form / = O(f ) mentioned above. No \nother solution exists if
  the gas as a whole is homogeneous and \nisotropic (i.e. all positions and directions
  are physically equiva- \nlent; see Appendix, 12). \n\nThe determination of the velocity
  distribution function /(| 2 ) \nwas recognized by Maxwell as a fundamental problem
  of kinetic \ntheory: it is the quantitative formulation of the 'law of chance' \nfor
  this case. He gave several solutions; his first and simplest \n\n\n\nKINETIC THEORY
  OF GASES 51 \n\nreasoning was this: Suppose the three components of velocity \ni
  f 2> 3 t be statistically independent, then \n\n\n\nThis functional equation has
  the only solution (see Appendix, 13) \n\n\n\nwhere a,j8 are constants. \n\nThis
  is Maxwell's celebrated law of velocity distribution. \nHowever, the derivation
  given is objectionable, as the supposed \nindependence of the velocity components
  is not obvious at all. \nI have mentioned it because the latest proof (and as 1
  think the \nmost satisfactory and rigorous and of the widest possible genera- \nlization)
  of the distribution formula uses exactly this Max wellian \nargument, only applied
  to more suitable variables as we shall \npresently see. \n\nMaxwell, being aware
  of this weakness, gave several other \nproofs which have been improved and modified
  by other authors. \nEventually it appears that there are two main types of argu-
  \nment: the equilibrium proof and the dynamical proof. We shall \nfirst consider
  the equilibrium proof in some detail. \n\nAssume each molecule to be a mechanical
  system with co- \nordinates q v g 2 ,... and momenta pi,i? 2 >> f r which we write
  \nsimply q,p, and with a Hamiltonian H(p,q). The interaction \nbetween the molecules
  will be neglected. The total number n \nand the total energy U of the assembly of
  molecules are \ngiven. \n\nIn order to apply the laws of probability it is convenient
  to \nreduce the continuous set of points p, q in phase space to a dis- \ncontinuous
  enumerable set of volume elements. One divides \nthe phase space into N small cells
  of volumes o> x V, a) 2 V,..., a> N V, \nwhere V is the total volume; hence \n\noi
  1 +oi 1 +...+co Ar = 1. (6.12) \n\nTo each cell a value of the energy H(p, q) can
  be attached, say \nthat corresponding to its centre; let these energies be 19 2
  ,..,, C N . \nNow suppose the particles distributed over the cells so that therof
  \n\n\n\n62 CHANCE \n\nare n^ in the first cell, n 2 in the second, etc., but of
  course with \nthe restriction that the totals \n\nn l +n 2 +...+n N = n, (6.13)
  \n\n= U (6.14) \n\n\n\nare fixed. Liouville's theorem suggests that the probability
  of a \nsingle molecule being in a given cell is proportional to its volume. \nMaking
  this assumption, one has to calculate the composite \nprobability P for any distribution
  n v %,..., n N under the restric- \ntions (6.13) and (6.14). \n\nThis is an elementary
  problem of the calculus of probability \n(see Appendix, 14) which can be solved
  in this way: First the \nsecond condition (6.14) is omitted; then the probability
  of a \ngiven distribution n It n 29 ... 9 n N is \n\nP( ni ,n z ,...,n N ) = _-_^c^,...y.
  (6-15) \n\n\n\nIf this is summed over all n l9 n 2 ,...,n N satisfying (6.13), one
  ob- \ntains by the elementary polynomial theorem \n\n2 P(n l9 n 29 ... 9 n N ) =
  K+c^+.-.+c^)\" = i, (6.16) \n\nni,na,...,n.y \n\nbecause of (6.12) as it must be
  if P is a properly normalized \nprobability. \n\nIt is well known that the polynomial
  coefficients n l/n^ ! n 2 ! . . .n N ! \nhave a sharp maximum for n x = n 2 = ...
  = n N ; that means, if \nall cells have equal volumes (o^ = cu 2 = ... = CO N )
  the uniform \ndistribution would have an overwhelming probability. Yet this \nis
  modified by the second condition (6.14) which we have now \nto take into account.
  The simplest method of doing this proceeds \nin three approximations which seem
  to be crude, but are perfectly \nsatisfactory for very large numbers of particles
  (n -> oo). The \nfirst approximation consists in neglecting all distributions of
  \ncomparatively small n lt n 2 ,...,n N ; then the n k can be treated as \ncontinuous
  variables. The second approximation consists in \nreplacing the exact expression
  (6.15) by its asymptotic value for \n\n\n\nKINETIC THEORY OF GASES 53 \n\nlarge
  n k by using Stirling's formula log(n!) ->n(logn 1) (see \nAppendix, 14), and the
  result is \n\nlogP = n l logn l n 2 logn 2 ...n N logn N -i~const. \n\n(6.17) \n\nThe
  third approximation consists in the following assumption: \nthe actual behaviour
  of a gas in statistical equilibrium is deter- \nmined solely by the state of maximum
  probability; all other \nstates have so little chance to appear that they can be
  neglected. \n\nHence one has to determine the maximum of log P given by \n(6.17)
  under the conditions (6.13) and (6.14). Using elementary \ncalculus this leads at
  once to \n\nn k = e-to, (6.18) \n\nwhere a and j8 are two constants which are necessary
  in order to \nsatisfy the conditions (6.13), (6.14). Yet these constants play a
  \nrather different part. \n\nIf one has to do with a mixture of two gases A and
  B with given \nnumbers n (A) and n (B \\ one gets two conditions of the type (6.13)
  \nbut only one of the type (6.14), expressing that the total energy \nis given.
  \n\nHence one obtains \n\nn& = e {A} -P#\\ 4*> = e* (B) -t<*\\ (6.19) \n\nwith two
  different constants a u) and a (B \\ but only one /?. There- \nfore ft is the parameter
  of thermal equilibrium between the two \nconstituents and must depend only on temperature.
  \n\nIndeed, if one now calculates the mean energy U and the \nmean pressure p, one
  can apply thermodynamics and sees \neasily that the second law is satisfied if \n\nP-W

  constant. At the same time it appears that the \nentropy is given by \n\n8 = klogP

  ; in particular (6.18) \n\n\n\n54 CHANCE \n\nis called Boltzmann's distribution
  law. It obviously contains \nMaxwell's law (6.11) as a special case, namely for
  mass points. \n\nWe have now to ask: Is this consideration which I called the \nequilibrium
  proof of the distribution law really satisfactory ? \n\nOne objection can be easily
  dismissed, namely that the \napproximations made are too crude. They can be completely
  \navoided. Darwin and Fowler have shown that one can give a \nrigorous expression
  for the mean value of any physical quantity \nin terms of complex integrals, containing
  the so-called 'partition \nfunction' (see Appendix 15) \n\na) I z*i+aj 2 z *+...+a>
  N z*x = F(z). (6.22) \n\nNo distribution is neglected and no use is made of the
  Stirling \nformula. Yet in the limit n ~> oo, all results are exactly the same \nas
  given by the Boltzmann distribution function. Although this \nmethod is extremely
  elegant and powerful, it does not introduce \nany essential new feature in regard
  to the fundamental question \nof statistical mechanics. \n\nAnother objection is
  going deeper: can the molecules of a gas \nreally be treated as independent ? \n\nThere
  are numerous phenomena which show they are not, \neven if one considers only statistical
  equilibrium. For no real \ngas is 'ideal', i.e. satisfies Boyle's law rigorously,
  and the devia- \ntions increase with pressure, ending in a complete collapse, con-
  \ndensation. This proves the existence of long-range attractive \nforces between
  the molecules. The statistical method described \nabove is unable to deal with them.
  The first attempt to correct \nthis was the celebrated theory of van der Waals,
  which was \nfollowed by many others. I shall later describe in a few words \nthe
  modern version of these theories, which is, from a certain \nstandpoint, rigorous
  and satisfactory. \n\nMore serious are the interactions revealed by non-equilibrium
  \nphenomena: viscosity, conduction of heat, diffusion. They can \nall be qualitatively
  understood by supposing that each molecule \nhas a finite volume, or more correctly
  that two molecules have a \nshort-range repulsive interaction which prohibits a
  close \napproach. This assumption has the consequence that there \n\n\n\nKINETIC
  THEORY OF GASES 55 \n\nexists an effective cross-section for a collision, hence
  a mean free \npath for the straight motion of a molecule. The coefficients of \nthe
  three phenomena mentioned can be reduced, by elementary \nconsiderations, to the
  free path, and the results, as far as they go, \nare in good agreement with observations.
  \n\nAll this is very good physics producing in a simple and intuitive \nway formulae
  which give the correct order of magnitude of \ndifferent correlated effects. \n\nBut
  for the problem of a rigorous kinetic theory, which takes \naccount of the interactions
  and is valid not only for equilibria, \nbut also for motion, these considerations
  have only the value of \na preliminary reconnoitring. The question is: How can one
  \nderive the hydrodynamical equations of visible motion together \nwith the phenomena
  of transformation and conduction of heat \nand, for a mixture, of diffusion ? \n\nThis
  is an ambitious programme. For such a theory must \ninclude the result that a gas
  left to itself tends to equilibrium. \nHence it must lead to irreversibility, although
  the laws of \nordinary reversible mechanics are assumed to hold for the mole- \ncules.
  How is this possible ? Further, is the equilibrium obtained \nin this way the same
  as that derived directly, say by the method \nof the most probable distribution
  ? \n\nTo begin with the last question. Its answer represents what I \nhave called
  above the dynamical proof of the distribution law \nfor equilibrium. \n\nThe formulation
  of the non-equilibrium theory of gases is due \nto Boltzmann. One can obtain his
  fundamental equation by \ngeneralizing one of the equivalent formulae (6.4) or (6.7).
  These \nare based on the assumption that each molecule moves indepen- \ndently of
  the others according to the laws of mechanics, and they \ndescribe how the distribution
  / of an assembly of such particles \ndevelops in time. Now the assumption of independence
  is \ndropped, hence the expression on the left-hand side of (6.4) or \n(6.7) is
  not zero; denoting by /(I) the probability density for a \ncertain particle 1, one
  can write \n\ndf(l) \n\n\n\ndt ~ et ~ L \" v v * /J (6 ' 23) \n\n\n\n56 CHANCE \n\nwhere
  (7(1) represents the influence of the other molecules on the \nparticle 1; it is
  called the 'collision integral', as Boltzmann cal- \nculates it only for the case
  where the orbit of the centre of a \nparticle can be described as straight and uniform
  motion \ninterrupted by sudden collisions. For this purpose a new and \nindependent
  application of the laws of probability is made by \nassumingthatthe probability
  of a collision between two particles 1 \nand 2 is proportional to the product of
  the probabilities of finding \nthem in a given configuration, /(l)/(2). If one then
  expresses that \nsome molecules are thrown by a collision out of a given element
  \nof phase space, others into it, one obtains (see Appendix, 16) \n\n0(1) = // {/W(2)-/(l)/(2)}|$r-5,|
  dbdZ z , (6.24) \n\nwhere /(2) is the same function as /(I), but taken for the particle
  \n2 as argument. /(I), /(2) refer to the motion of two particles \n'before' the
  collision, /'(I), /'(2) to that 'after' the collision; one \nhas to integrate over
  all velocities of the particle 2, (d% 2 ) 9 and over \nthe 'cross-section' of the
  collision, (rfb), which I shall not define \nin detail. 'Before' and 'after' the
  collision mean the asymptotic \nstraight and uniform motions of approach and separation;
  it is \nclear that if the former is given, the latter is completely deter- \nmined
  for any law of interaction force it is the two-body problem \nof mechanics. Hence
  the velocities of both particles !> JE^ after \nthe collision are known functions
  of those before the collision \n!, 5 2 > an d (6.23) assumes the form of an integro-differential
  \nequation for calculating /. \n\nThis equation has been the object of thorough
  mathematical \ninvestigations, first by Boltzmann and Maxwell, and later by \nmodern
  writers. Hilbert has indicated a systematic method of \nsolution in which each step
  of approximation leads to an integral \nequation of the normal (so-called Predholm)
  type. Enskog and \nChapman have developed this method, with some modifications,
  \nin detail. There is an admirable book by Chapman and Cowling \nwhich represents
  the whole theory of non -homogeneous gases as \na consequence of the equation (6.23).
  I can only mention a few \npoints of these important investigations. \n\nThe first
  is concerned with the question of equilibrium. Does \n\n\n\nKINETIC THEOBY OF GASES
  57 \n\nthe equation (6.23) really indicate an irreversible approach from \nany initial
  state to a homogeneous equilibrium ? This is in fact \nthe case, and a very strange
  result indeed: the metamorphosis \nof reversible mechanics into irreversible thermodynamics
  with \nthe help of probability. But before discussing this difficult \nquestion,
  I shall indicate the mathematical proof. \n\nFrom the statistics of equilibrium
  it is known how the entropy \nis connected with probability, namely by equation
  (6.21). \nReplace here the discontinuous n k by the continuous / and \nsummation
  by integration over the phase space, and you obtain \n\nS = -k J/(l)log/(l) dqdp.
  (6.25) \n\nIf one now calculates the time derivative dS/dt by substituting \ndf(l)/dt
  from (6.23), and assuming no external interference, one \nfinds (see Appendix, 17)
  \n\nf>0, (6.26) \n\nwhere the = sign holds only if /(I) is independent of the space
  \ncoordinates and satisfies, as a function of the velocities, \n\n/(l)/(2)=/'(l)/'(2)
  (6.27) \n\nidentically for any collision. \n\nThe result expressed by (6.26) is
  often quoted as Boltzmann's \njBT-theorem (because he used the symbol H for S/k).
  Boltz- \nmann claimed that it gave the statistical explanation of \nthermodynamical
  irreversibility. \n\nEquation (6.27) is a functional equation which determines /
  \nas a function of 'collision invariants', like total energy and total \nmomentum.
  If the gas is at rest as a whole, the only solution of \n(6.27) is Maxwell's (or
  Boltzmann's) distribution law: \n\n/=*-*, H(p,q) = . (6.28) \n\nThis is what I called
  the dynamical proof, and is a most remarkable \nresult indeed; for it has been derived
  from the mechanism of \ncollisions, which was completely neglected in the previous
  \nequilibrium methods. This point needs elucidation. \n\nBefore doing so, let me
  mention that the hydro-thermal \nequations of a gas, i.e. the equations of continuity,
  of motion and \n\n\n\n68 CHANCE \n\nof conduction of heat, are obtained from Boltzmann's
  equation \n(6.23) by a simple formal process (multiplication with 1,5 and \n|w!-
  2 followed by integration over all velocities) in terms of the \nstress tensor T
  you will remember Cauchy's general formula \n(4.9) which itself is expressed in
  terms of the distribution \nfunction /. To give these equations a real meaning,
  one has to \nexpand/ in terms of physical quantities, and this is the object of
  \nthe theories contained in Chapman and Cowling's book. In this \nwayavery satisfactory
  theory of hydro -thermodynamics of gases, \nincluding viscosity, conduction of heat,
  and diffusion, is obtained. \n\nSTATISTICAL MECHANICS \n\nI remember that forty
  years ago when I began to read scientific \nliterature there was a violent discussion
  raging about statistical \nmethods in physics, especially the H -theorem. The objections
  \nraised have been classified into two types, one concerning reversi- \nbility,
  the other periodicity. \n\nLoschmidt, like Boltzmann, a member of the Austrian school,
  \nformulated the reversibility objection in this way: by reversing \nall velocities
  you get from any solution of the mechanical \nequations another one how can the
  integral $, which depends \non the instantaneous situation, increase in both cases
  ? \n\nThe periodicity objection is based on a theorem of the great \nFrench mathematician
  Henri Poincar6, which states that every \nmechanical system is, if not exactly periodic,
  at least quasi- \nperiodic. This follows from Liouville's theorem according to \nwhich
  a given region in phase space moves without change of \nvolume and describes therefore
  a tube-shaped region of ever \nincreasing length. As the total volume available
  is finite (it is \ncontained in the surface of maximum energy), this tube must \nsomewhere
  intersect itself, which means that final and initial \nstates come eventually near
  together. \n\nZermelo, a German mathematician, who worked on abstract \nproblems
  like the theory of Cantor's sets and transfinite num- \nbers, ventured into physics
  by translating Gibbs's work on \nstatistical mechanics into German. But he was offended
  by the \nlogical imperfections of this theory and attacked it violently. \nHe used
  in particular Poincar^'s theorem to show how scanda- \n\n\n\nSTATISTICAL MECHANICS
  . 69 \n\nlous the reasoning of the physicists was: they claimed to have \nproved
  the irreversible increase of a mechanical quantity for \na system which returns
  after a finite time to its initial state with \nany desired accuracy. \n\nThese
  objections were not quite futile, as they led two dis- \ntinguished physicists,
  Paul Ehrenfest and his wife Tat j ana, to \ninvestigate and clear up the matter
  beyond doubt in their well- \nknown article in vol. iv of the Mathematical Encyclopedia.
  \n\nTo-day we hardly need to follow all the logical finesses of this \nwork. It
  suffices to point out that the objections are based on the \nfollowing misunderstanding.
  If we describe the behaviour of the \ngas (we speak only of this simple case, as
  for no other case has \nthe .ff-theorem been proved until recently) by the equation
  (6.4) , \ntaking for H the Hamiltonian of the whole system, a function of \nthe
  coordinates and momenta of all particles, then / is indeed \nreversible and quasi-periodic,
  no H- theorem can be proved. \n\nBoltzmann's proof is based not on this equation,
  but on (6.23), \nwhere now H is the Hamiltonian of one single molecule un- \ndisturbed
  by the others, and where the right-hand term is not \nzero but equal to the collision
  integral C( 1). The latter is taken as \nrepresenting roughly the effect of all
  the other molecules; \n'roughly', that means after some reasonable averaging. This
  \naveraging is the expression of our ignorance of the actual micro- \nscopic situation.
  Boltzmann's theorem says that this equation \nmixing mechanical knowledge with ignorance
  of detail leads to \nirreversibility. There is no contradiction between the two
  state- \nments. \n\nBut there rises the other question whether such a modification
  \nof the fundamental equation is justified. We shall see presently \nthat it is
  indeed, in a much wider sense than that claimed by \nBoltzmann, namely not only
  for a gas, but for any substance \nwhich can be described by a mechanical model.
  We have there- \nfore now to take up the question of how statistical methods can
  \nbe applied to general mechanical systems. Without such a \ntheory, one cannot
  even treat the deviations from the so-called \nideal behaviour of gases (Boyle's
  law), which appear at high \npressure and low temperature, and which lead to condensation.
  \n\n\n\n60 CHANCE \n\nTheories like that of van der Waals have obviously only pre-
  \nliminary character. What is needed is a general and well- \nfounded formalism
  covering the gaseous, liquid, and solid states, \nunder all kind of external forces.
  \n\nFor the case of statistical equilibrium, this formalism was \nsupplied by Willard
  Gibbs's celebrated book on Statistical \nMechanics (1901), which has proved to be
  extremely successful \nin its applications (see Appendix, 18). The gist of Gibbs's
  idea \nis to apply Boltzmann's results for a real assembly of many \nequal molecules
  to an imaginary or Virtual' assembly of many \ncopies of the system under consideration,
  and to postulate that \nthe one system under observation will behave like the average
  \ncalculated for the assembly. Before criticizing this assumption, \nlet us have
  a glimpse of Gibbs's procedure. He starts from \nLiouville's theorem (6.4) and considers
  especially the case of \nequilibrium where the partition function/of his virtual
  assembly \nhas to satisfy equation (6.9). He states that/ = <P(T) is a solu- \ntion
  (as we have seen) and he chooses two particular forms of \nthe function O. The first
  is \n\n/ = (H) = const., if E < H < E+&E, (6 2g) \n\n= outside of this interval,
  \n\nwhere E is a given energy and kE a small interval of energy. \n(In modern notation
  one could write (H) = 8(HE), where \n8 is Dirac's symbolic function.) The corresponding
  distribution \nhe calls micro-canonical. \n\nThe second form is just that of Maxwell-Boltzmann,
  \n\nf=e-fte, H(p,q) = E, (6.30) \n\nand the corresponding distribution is called
  canonical. Gibbs shows \nthat both assumptions lead to the same results for the
  averages \nof physical quantities. But the canonical is preferable, as it is \nsimpler
  to handle. /? turns out again to be equal for systems in \nthermal equilibrium;
  if one puts /? = 1/kT the formal relations \nbetween the averages constructed with
  (6.30) are a true replica \nof thermodynamics. For instance, the normalization condition
  \nfor the probability \n\njfdpdq = J eP-P* dpdq = 1 (6.31) \n\n\n\nSTATISTICAL MECHANICS
  61 \n\ncan be written \n\nJ = /0 = kTlog Z, Z = jj e~WMdpdq. (6.32) \n\nThis F plays
  the part of Helmholtz's free energy. The integral \nZ, to-day usually called the
  'partition function', depends, apart \nfrom the energy E, on molar parameters like
  the volume F. \nAll physical properties can be obtained by differentiation, e.g.
  \nentropy S and pressure p by \n\n8F 8F \n\ns =-^' *=-fr < 6 - 33 > \n\nThis formalism
  has been amazingly successful in treating thermo- \nmechanical and also thermo-chemical
  properties. For instance, \nthe theory of real (non-ideal) gases is obtained by
  writing \n\nE = H(p, q) - K(p)+ U(q), (6.34) \n\nwhere K is the kinetic and U the
  potential energy; the latter \ndepends on the mutual interactions of the molecules.
  As K is \nquadratic in the p, the corresponding integration in Z is easily \nperformed
  and the whole problem reduces to calculating the \nmultiple integral \n\nQ = j ...
  J e\" u ^^'\"^ kT dq^dq^dq N . (6.35) \n\nStill, this is a very formidable task,
  and much work has been \nspent on it. I shall mention only the investigations initiated
  by \nUrsell, and perfected by Mayer and others, the aim of which was \nto replace
  van der Waals's semi-empirical equation of state by \nan exact one. In fact one
  can expand Q into a series of powers of \nV\" 1 and, introducing this into (6.32)
  and (6.33), one obtains the \npressure p as a similar series \n\n\n\nwhere the coefficients
  -4,-B,..., called virial coefficients, are \nfunctions of T. One can even go further
  and discuss the process \nof condensation, but the mathematical difficulties in
  the treat- \nment of the liquid state itself are prohibitive. \n\nThe range of application
  of Gibbs's theory is enormous. But \nreading his book again, I felt the lack of
  a deeper foundation. \n\n\n\n62 CHANCE \n\nA few years later (1902, 1903) there
  appeared a series of papers \nby Einstein in which the same formalism was developed,
  \nobviously quite independently, as Maxwell and Boltzmann are \nquoted, but not
  Gibbs; these papers contained two essential \nimprovements: an attempt to justify
  the statistical assumptions, \nand an application to a case which at once transformed
  the kinetic \ntheory of matter from a useful hypothesis into something very real
  \nand directly observable, namely, the theory of Brownian motion. \n\nConcerning
  the foundation, Einstein used an argument which \nBoltzmann had already introduced
  to support his distribution \nlaw (6.18) though this seems to be hardly necessary,
  as for a \nreal assembly the method of enumerating distributions over \ncells is
  perfectly satisfactory. Curiously enough, this argument \nof Boltzmann is based
  on a theorem similar to Poincare's con- \nsiderations on quasi-periodicity with
  which Zermelo intended \nto smash statistical mechanics altogether. Einstein considers
  a \ndistribution of the micro-canonical type, in Gibbs's nomen- \nclature, where
  only one 'energy surface' H(p,q) = E in the phase \nspace is taken into account.
  The representative point in phase \nspace moves always on this surface. It may happen
  that the \nwhole surface is covered in such a way that the orbit passes \nthrough
  every point of the surface. Such systems are called \nergodic; but it is rather
  doubtful whether they exist at all. \nSystems are called quasi-ergodic where the
  orbit comes near to \nevery point of the energy surface; that this happens can be
  seen \nby an argument similar to that which leads to Poincare's theorem \nof quasi-periodicity.
  Then it can be made plausible that the total \ntime of sojourn of the moving point
  in a given part of the energy \nsurface is proportional to its area; hence the time
  average of any \nfunction of p, q is obviously the same as that taken with the help
  \nof a micro-canonical virtual assembly. In this way quasi- \nperiodicity is used
  to justify statistical mechanics, exactly \nreversing Zermelo 's reasoning. This
  paradox is resolved by the \nremark that Zermelo believes the period to be large
  and macro- \nscopic, while Einstein assumes it to be unobservably small. \nWho is
  right ? You may find the obvious answer for yourselves \n(see Appendix, 19). \n\n\n\nSTATISTICAL
  MECHANICS 63 \n\nModern writers use other ways of establishing the foundations \nof
  statistical mechanics. They are mostly adaptations of the \ncell-method to the virtual
  assembly; one has then to explain why \nthe average properties of a single real
  observed system can be \nobtained by averaging over a great many systems of the
  virtual \nassembly. Some say simply: As we do not know the real state, \nwe have
  the right to expect the average provided exceptional \nsituations are theoretically
  extremely rare and this is of course \nthe case. Others say we have not to do with
  a single isolated \nsystem, but with a system in thermal contact with its surround-
  \nings, as if it were in a thermostat or heat bath; we can then \nassume this heat
  bath to consist of a great many copies of the \nsystem considered, so that the virtual
  assembly is transformed \ninto a real one. I think considerations of this kind are
  not very \nsatisfactory. \n\nThere remains the fact that statistical mechanics has
  justified \nitself by explaining a great many actual phenomena. Among \nthese are
  the fluctuations and the Brownian motion to which \nEinstein applied his theory
  (see Appendix, 20). To appreciate \nthe importance of this step one has to remember
  that at that \ntime (about 1900) atoms and molecules were still far from being \nas
  real as they are to-day there were still physicists who did \nnot believe in them.
  After Einstein's work this was hardly \npossible any longer. Visible tiny particles
  suspended in a gas or a \nliquid (colloid solution) are test bodies small enough
  to reveal \nthe granular structure of the surrounding medium by their \nirregular
  motion. Einstein showed that the statistical properties \nof this movement (mean
  density, mean square displacement in \ntime, etc.) agree qualitatively with the
  predictions of kinetic \ntheory. Perrin later confirmed these results by exact measure-
  \nments and obtained the first reliable value of Avogadro's num- \nber N, the number
  of particles per mole. From now on kinetic \ntheory and statistical mechanics were
  definitely established. \n\nBut beyond this physical result, Einstein's theory of
  Brownian \nmotion had a most important consequence for scientific metho- \ndology
  in general. The accuracy of measurement depends on the \nsensitivity of the instruments,
  and this again on the size and \n\n\n\n64 CHANCE \n\nweight of the mobile parts
  and the restoring forces acting on \nthem. Before Einstein's work it was tacitly
  assumed that \nprogress in this direction was limited only by experimental \ntechnique.
  Now it became obvious that this was not so. If an \nindicator, like the needle of
  a galvanometer, became too small \nor the suspending fibre too thin, it would never
  be at rest but \nperform a kind of Brownian movement. This has in fact been \nobserved.
  Similar phenomena play a large part in modern \nelectronic technique, where the
  limit of observation is given by \nirregular variations which can be heard as a
  'noise' in a loud \nspeaker. There is a limit of observability given by the laws
  of \nnature themselves. \n\nThis is a striking example that the code of rules for
  inference \nby induction, though perhaps metaphysical in some way, is \ncertainly
  not a priori, but subject to reactions from the know- \nledge which it has helped
  to create. For those rules which taught \nthe experimentalist how to obtain and
  improve the accuracy of \nhis findings contained to begin with certainly no hint
  that there \nis a natural end to the process. \n\nHowever, the idea of unlimited
  improvement of accuracy need \nnot be given up yet. One had only to add the rule:
  make your \nmeasurements at as low a temperature as possible. For Brownian \nmotion
  dies down with decreasing temperature. \n\nYet later developments in physics proved
  this rule also to be \nineffective, and a much more trenchant change in the code
  had \nto be made. \n\nBut before dealing with this question we have to finish our
  \nreview of statistical methods in classical mechanics. \n\nGENERAL KINETIC THEORY
  \n\nKinetic theory could only be regarded as complete if it \napplied to matter
  in (visible) motion as well as to equilibrium. \nBut if you look through the literature
  you will find very little \na few simple cases. The most important of these, the
  theory of \ngases, has been dealt with in some detail. Two others must be \nmentioned
  : the theory of solids and of the Brownian motion. \n\nIdeal solids are crystal
  lattices or gigantic periodic molecules. \n\n\n\nGENERAL KINETIC THEORY 65 \n\nBut
  only for zero temperature are the atoms in regularly spaced \nequilibrium positions;
  for higher temperatures they begin to \nvibrate. As long as the amplitudes are small,
  the mutual forces \nwill be linear functions of them; then the vibrations can be
  \nanalysed into 'normal modes', each of which is a wave running \nthrough the lattice
  with a definite frequency. These normal \nmodes represent a system of independent
  harmonic oscillations \nto which Gibbs's method of statistical mechanics can be
  applied \nwithout any difficulty. If, however, the temperature rises, the \namplitudes
  of the vibrations increase and higher terms appear in \nthe interaction: the waves
  are scattering one another and are \ntherefore strongly damped. Hence there exists
  a kind of free \npath for the transport of energy which can be used for explaining
  \nconduction of heat in crystals (Debye). Similar considerations, \napplied to the
  electrons in metallic crystals, are used for the \nexplanation of transport phenomena
  like electric and thermal \nconduction in metals. \n\nIn the case of Brownian motion,
  I have already mentioned that \nEinstein calculated not only the mean density of
  a colloidal \nsolution, say, under gravity, but also the mean square displace- \nment
  of a single suspended particle in time (or, what amounts to \nthe same, the dispersion
  of a colloid by diffusion as a function \nof time). The simplifying assumption which
  makes this possible \nis that the mass of the colloidal particle is large compared
  with the \nmass of the surrounding molecules, so that these impart only \nsmall
  impulses. Similar considerations have been applied to \nother fluctuation phenomena
  (see Appendix, 20). \n\nA great number of more or less isolated examples of non-
  \nequilibria have been treated by a semi-empirical method which \nuses the notion
  of relaxation time. You find a very complete \naccount of such things related to
  solids and liquids in a book of \nJ. Frenkel, Kinetic Theory of Liquids. But you
  must not expect \nto find in this work a systematic theory, based on a general idea,
  \nnor will you find it in any other book. \n\nMy collaborator Dr. Green and I have
  tried to fill this gap, \nand to develop the kinetic theory of matter in general.
  I hope \nyou will not mind if I indulge a little in the pleasure of explaining \n\n5131
  E \n\n\n\n66 CHANCE \n\nthe leading ideas. It will help the understanding of the
  interplay \nof cause and chance in the laws of nature. \n\nWe have to remember the
  general principles laid down by \nGibbs which he, however, used only for the case
  of statistical \nequilibrium. \n\nAn arbitrary piece of matter, fluid or solid,
  is, from the atomis- \ntic standpoint, a mechanical system of particles (atoms,
  mole- \ncules) defined by a Hamiltonian H. Its state is completely \ndetermined
  if the initial values of coordinates and momenta are \ngiven. Actually this is not
  the case; but there is a probability \n(as yet unknown) f(p,q)dpdq for the initial
  distribution. The \ncausal laws of motion demand that the distribution f(t,p>q)
  at \na later time t is a solution of the Liouville equation (6.4) (p. 49) \n\ng
  -!-[*,/] -0. (6.37) \n\nnamely that solution which for t = becomes /, \n\n,g)=/(3>,g).
  (6.38) \n\n\n\nLet us assume for simplicity that all molecules are equal \nparticles
  (point masses) with coordinates x (fc) and velocities \n%w = pw/m. We shall consider/
  to be a function of these and \nwrite/(tf, x,). If wewant to indicate thatafunction/
  depends onh \nparticles, we do not write all arguments, but simply f h (l, 2,...h)
  or \nshortly //>. As all the particles are physically indistinguishable, we \ncan
  assume all the functions/^ to be symmetrical in the particles. \n\nNow the physicist
  is not directly interested in a symmetric \nsolution /# of (6.37). He wants to know
  such things as the num- \nber density (number of particles per unit volume) n^(t,
  x) at a \ngiven point x of space, or perhaps, in addition, the velocity dis- \ntribution
  f^t, x, ), i.e. just those quantities which are familiar \nfrom the kinetic theory
  of gases, depending on one particle only. \n\nOne has therefore to reduce the function/^
  for N particles step \nby step to the function f l of one particle. \n\nThis is
  done by integrating over the position and velocity of \none particle, say the last
  one, with the help of the integral \n\noperator \n\n(6.39) \n\n\n\nGENERAL KINETIC
  THEORY 67 \n\ni is g iven > we obtain f q by applying the operator X Q +I, it is,
  \nhowever, convenient to add a normalizing factor and to write \n\n(N-q)f t = **/,
  (6.40) \n\nThe physical meaning of the operation is this: we give up the \npretence
  to know the whereabouts of one particle and declare \nfrankly our ignorance. By
  repeated application of the operation, \nwe obtain a chain of functions \n\n/*,
  /*-i, ., / A, (6-41) \n\nto which one can add/ = 1 ; f q means the probability of
  finding \nthe system in a state where q particles have fixed positions (i.e. \nlie
  in given elements). The normalization is such that \n\nJ/ x (*, xa>, |W) dci> =
  ni (t, x) (6.42) \n\nis the number density; for one has \n\n\n\nJ \n\n\n\nwhere
  the last equality follows from (6.40) for q = (with \n\n/o = 1). \n\nNow we have
  to reduce the fundamental equation (6.37) step by \n\nstep by repeatedly applying
  the operator x ( see Appendix, 21). \nAssuming that the atoms are acting on another
  with central \nforces, <I> W) being the potential energy between two of them, the
  \nresult of the reduction is a chain of equations of the form \n\n\n\n(q=l,2 9 ...,N),
  (6.44) \n\nwhere S X+it^^VrH]- ( 6 - 45 ) \n\n\n\nq \n\n\n\nThis quantity S q will
  be called the statistical term. What is the \nadvantage of this splitting up of
  the problem into the solution of \na chain of equations ? The first impression is
  that there is no \nadvantage at all; for to determine/! you need to know S v but
  S^ \ncontains / 2 , and this again depends on/ 3 , and so on, so that one \neventually
  arrives at f N , which satisfies the original equation. \nYet this reasoning supposes
  the desire to get information about \nevery detail of the motion, and that is just
  what we do not want. \n\n\n\n68 CHANCE \n\nWe wish to obtain some observable and
  rather crude averages. \nStarting from/! and climbing up to/ 2 ,/ 3 ,..., we can
  soon stop, as \nthe chaos increases with the number of particles, and replace the
  \nrigorous connexion between f q and/ ff+1 by an approximate one, \naccording to
  the imperfection of observation. \n\nBefore explaining the application of this 'method
  of ignorance' \nto simple examples, I wish to mention that we have actually \nfound
  the chain of equations (6.44) in quite a different way, \nstarting with f l and
  using the calculus of probability for events \nnot independent of one another (see
  Appendix, 22). \n\nThis derivation is less formal than the first one and illuminates
  \nthe physical meaning of the statistical term. \n\nIt would now be very attractive
  to show how from this general \nformula (6.44) the mechanical and thermal laws for
  continuous \nsubstances can be derived. But I have to restrict myself to a \nfew
  indications concerning the general 'method of ignorance', \nto which I have already
  alluded. \n\nThe first example is the theory of gases. We have seen that \nthis
  theory is based on Boltzmann's equation (6.23) \n\n(6.46) \n\n\n\nwhere (7(1) is
  the collision integral (6.24); \n\n0(1) = j [/ / (l)/'(2)-/(l)/(2)]|? 1 -? 2 | \n\nNow
  (6.46) has the same form as our general formula (6.44) for \nq = 1, provided (7(1)
  can be identified with 8 V \n\nGreen has shown that this is indeed the case, provided
  that the \nmolecular forces have a small range r ; then one can assume that \nin
  the gaseous state the probability of finding more than two \nparticles in a distance
  smaller than r is negligible. In other \nwords, one can exclude all except 'binary'
  encounters. Two \nparticles outside the sphere of interaction can be regarded as
  \nindependent; hence one has there \n\n/(l,2)=A(l)./i(2). (6.48) \n\nThis holds
  also, in virtue of Liouville's theorem, if on the left- \nhand side the positions
  and velocities refer to a point in th \n\n\n\nGENERAL KINETIC THEORY 69 \n\ninterior
  of the sphere of action while on the right-hand side the \nvalues on its surface
  are used. With the help of this fact, the \nintegration in S 1 can be performed
  (see Appendix, 23), and \nleads exactly to the expression (7(1), in which only the
  * boundary \nvalues' of the functions/(l) and/(2) on the surface of the sphere \nof
  action appear. \n\nHence the whole kinetic theory of gases is contained as a \nspecial
  case in our theory. \n\nConcerning liquids, one must proceed in a different way,
  \nbecause triple and higher collisions cannot be handled with \nelementary formulae.
  We have adopted a method suggested by \nthe American physicist Kirkwood. His formula
  is a generali- \nzation of (6.48), namely \n\n23> _/2(2,3)/ 2 (3,l)/ 2 (l,2) \n>
  >3) -- \n\n\n\nand may be interpreted in different ways, e.g. by saying that the
  \noccurrences of three pairs of particles (2, 3), (3, 1), (1, 2) at given \npositions
  and with given velocities are almost independent \nevents, because the mutual interactions
  decrease rapidly with \nthe distance. \n\nSubstituting / 3 from (6.49) in $ 2 ,
  one obtains from (6.44), \n(6.45) two integro-differential equations for/! and/
  2 which form \na closed system and can be solved by suitable approximations. \n(If
  then / 3 is calculated from the solution f l9 / 2 , with the help of \n(6.49), the
  relation (6.40) for q = 3 is not necessarily satisfied; \nthis is the sacrifice
  of accuracy introduced by the Kirkwood \nmethod.) \n\nAll physical properties of
  a liquid of the kind discussed here \n(particles with central forces) can be expressed
  in terms of \nti 2 (l, 2), a function known to the experimenters in X-ray research
  \non liquids as the radial distribution function. The method \nexplained leads to
  explicit formulae for the equation of state \nand the energy; it allows also a discussion
  of the singularity \nwhich separates the gaseous and liquid states. But I cannot
  \nenter into a discussion of details. \n\nConcerning non-equilibria, one can obtain
  the differential \n\n\n\n70 CHANCE \n\nequations for the mechanical and thermal
  flow in a rigorous way; \nthe result has, of course, the form of Cauchy's equations
  (4.9) \nfor continuous media, yet with a stress tensor T^ which can be \nexplicitly
  expressed in terms of the time derivatives of the strain \ntensor (or the space
  derivative of the velocity) and the gradient \nof temperature. In this way expressions
  for the coefficients of \nviscosity and thermal conductivity are obtained. They
  differ \nfrom the known formulae for gases by the great contribution of \nthe mutual
  forces. Yet again I cannot dwell on this subject \nwhich would lead us far from
  the main topic of these lectures, \nto which I propose now to return (see Appendix,
  33). \n\n\n\nVII \nCHANCE AND ANTECEDENCE \n\nWHAT can we learn from all this about
  the general problem of \ncause and chance ? The example of gases has already shown
  us \nthat the introduction of chance and probability into the laws of \nmotion removes
  the reversibility inherent in them; or, in other \nwords, it leads to a conception
  of time which has a definite \ndirection and satisfies the principle of antecedence
  in the \ncause-effect relation. \n\nThe formal method consists in defining a certain
  quantity, \n\n\n\nf \n\njfdpdq \n\n\n\nand showing that it never decreases in time
  : dS/dt ^ 0. In the \ncase of a gas, the function / was the distribution function
  f l of \none single molecule, a function of the point p, q of the phase \nspace
  of this molecule. \n\nThe same integral represents also the entropy of an arbitrary
  \nsystem in statistical mechanics, if / is replaced by f N , the \ndistribution
  function in the 22V-dimensional phase space; it \nsatisfies all equilibrium relations
  of ordinary thermodynamics. \n\nIn the case of a gas, the time derivative of 8 could
  be deter- \nmined with the help of Boltzmann's collision equation, and it \nwas
  found that always \n\n^ > 0. (7.2) \n\nat \n\nI have stressed the point that this
  is not in contradiction to \nthe reversibility of mechanics; for this reversibility
  refers to a \ndistribution function of non-interacting molecules, satisfying \n\nf=[#J],
  (7-3) \n\nwhile molecules colliding with one another satisfy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n72 CHANCE
  AND ANTECEDENCE \n\nwhere C is the collision integral. Irreversibility is therefore
  a \nconsequence of the explicit introduction of ignorance into the \nfundamental
  laws. \n\nNow the same considerations hold for any system. If we take \nfor / the
  function f N of a closed system of N particles, (7.3) is \nagain satisfied, and
  if its solution is introduced into (7.1), it can \nbe easily shown that dS/dt =
  0. \n\nIrreversibility can be understood only by explicitly exempting \na part of
  the system from causality. One has to abandon the \ncondition that the system is
  closed, or that the positions and \nvelocities of all particles are under control.
  The remarkable \nthing is that it suffices to assume one single particle beyond
  con- \ntrol. Then we have to do with a system of N+ 1 particles, but \nconcentrate
  our interest only on N of them. The partition func- \ntion of these N particles
  satisfies the equation (6.44) for q = N: \n\n% = [H N ,f N ]+8 N , (7.5) \n\nwhere
  8 N is a certain integral over/^ +1 given by (6.45) for q = N. \nFor a solution
  of this equation (7.5) the entropy is either constant \nor increasing. This is of
  course a fortiori the case if the system \nof N particles is coupled to more complicated
  systems out of \ncontrol (see Appendix, 24). \n\nThe increase of S continues until
  statistical equilibrium is \nreached, and it can be shown that the final distribution
  is the \ncanonical one \n\n) = E. (7.6) \n\n\n\nThis result is, in my opinion, the
  final answer of the age-old \nquestion how the reversibility of classical mechanics
  and the \nIrreversibility of thermodynamics can be reconciled. The latter \nis due
  to a deliberate renunciation of the demand that in prin- \nciple the fate of every
  single particle can be determined. You \nmust violate mechanics in order to obtain
  a result in obvious \ncontradiction to it. But one may say: this violation may be
  \nnecessary from practical reasons because one can neither observe \nall particles
  nor solve the innumerable equations in reality, \nhowever, the world is reversible,
  and thermodynamics only a \n\n\n\nCHANCE AND ANTECEDENCE 73 \n\ntrick for obtaining
  probable, not certain, results. This is the \nstandpoint taken in many presentations
  of statistical mechanics. \nIt is difficult to contradict if one accepts the axiom
  that the \npositions and velocities of all particles can, at least in principle,
  \nbe determined but can this really be maintained? We have \nseen that the Brownian
  motion sets a limit to all observations \neven on a macroscopic scale. One needs
  a spirit who can do \nthings we could not even do with infinitely improved technical
  \nmeans. Further, the idea of a completely closed system is also \nalmost fantastic.
  \n\nI think that the statistical foundation of thermodynamics is \nquite satisfactory
  even on the ground of classical mechanics. \n\nBut in fact, classical mechanics
  has turned out to be defective \njust in the atomic domain where we have applied
  it. The whole \nsituation has therefore to be re-examined in the light of quantum
  \nmechanics. \n\n\n\nVIII \nMATTER \n\nMASS, ENERGY, AND RADIATION \n\nIN order
  not to lose sight of my main subject I have added to the \nheading of each section
  of these lectures words like 'cause', \n'contiguity', 'antecedence', 'chance'. The
  one for the present \nsection, 'matter', seems to be an intruder. For classical
  philo- \nsophy teaches that matter is a fundamental conception of a \nspecific kind,
  entirely different from cause, though on the same \nlevel in the hierarchy of notions:
  another 'category' in Kant's \nterminology. This doctrine was generally accepted
  at the time \nbefore the great discoveries were made of which I have now to \nspeak.
  It was the period when physics was governed by the \ndualism 'force and matter',
  Kraft und Stoff (the title of a popular \nbook by Biichner). In modern physics this
  duality has become \nvague, almost obsolete. The first steps in this direction have
  been \ndescribed in the preceding survey: the transition from Newton's \ndistance
  forces to contact forces, first in mechanics, then in \nelectromagnetism, and finally
  for gravitation; in other words, \nthe victory of the idea of contiguity. If force
  is spreading in \n'empty space' with finite velocity, space cannot be quite empty;
  \nthere must be something which carries the forces. So space is \nfilled with ether,
  a kind of substance akin to ordinary matter \nin many respects, in which strains
  and stresses can be produced. \nThough these contact forces obey different laws
  from those which \ngovern elasticity, they are still forces in an ether, something
  \ndifferent from the carrier. Yet this distinction vanishes more \nand more. Relativity
  showed that the ether does not share with \nordinary matter the property of 'localization
  5 : you cannot say \n'here I am' ; there is no physical way of identifying a point
  in the \nether, as you could recognize a point in running water by a \nlittle mark,
  a particle of dust. Electric and magnetic stresses \nare not something in the ether,
  they are 'the ether' . The question \nof a carrier becomes meaningless. \n\nHowever,
  this is a question of interpretation. Physicists are \n\n\n\nMASS, ENEKGY, AND RADIATION
  75 \n\nvery broad-minded in this respect; they will continue using obso- \nlete
  expressions like ether, and no harm is done. For them a \nmatter of terminology
  is not serious until a new quantitative \nlaw is involved. That has happened here
  indeed. I refer to the \nlaw connecting mass m, energy e, and the velocity of light
  c \n(see Appendix, 25), _ mc ^ (8 x) \n\nwhich, after having been found to hold
  in special cases, was \ngenerally established by Einstein. His reasoning is based
  on the \nexistence of the pressure of light, demonstrated experimentally \nand also
  derivable from Maxwell's equations of electrodynamics. \nIf a body of mass M emits
  a well-defined quantity of light in a \nparallel beam which carries the total electromagnetic
  energy e, \nit suffers a recoil corresponding to the momentum /c transferred. \nIt
  therefore moves in the opposite direction, and to avoid a clash \nwith the mechanical
  law that the centre of mass of a system \ncannot be accelerated by an internal process,
  one has to ascribe \nto the beam of light not only an energy e and momentum /c but
  \nalso a mass e/c 2 , and to assume that the mass M of the emitting \nbody is reduced
  by the same amount m = e/c 2 .f \n\nThe theory of relativity renders this result
  quite natural. It \nprovides, moreover, an expression for the dependence of mass
  \non velocity; one has \n\n\n\nwhere m is called the rest-mass. Energy e and momentum
  p are \nthen given by f = ^ p = my (g 3) \n\nI need hardly to remind you how this
  result of 'purest science' \nhas been lately confirmed by a terrifying, horrible,
  'technical' \napplication in New Mexico, Japan, and Bikini. There is no \ndoubt,
  matter and energy are the same. The old duality between \nthe force and the substance
  on which it acts, has to be aban- \ndoned, and hence also the original idea of force
  as the cause of \nmotion. We see how old notions are dissolved by new ex- \nperiences.
  It is this process which has led me to the abstract \n\nt M. Born, Atomic Physics
  (Blackie), 4th ed., 1948, Ch. III. 2, p. 52 ; A. VII, \np. 288. See Appendix, 25.
  \n\n\n\n76 MATTER \n\ndefinition of causality based only on the notion of physical
  \ndependence, but transcending special theories which change \naccording to the
  experimental situation. \n\nReturning to our immediate object, we learn from Einstein's
  \nlaw that the atomistic conception of matter is necessarily con- \nnected with
  the atomistic conception of energy. In fact the \nexistence of quanta of energy
  was deduced by Planck from the \nlaws of heat radiation five years before Einstein
  published his \nrelation between mass and energy. \n\nPlanck's discovery opened
  the first chapter in the history of \nquantum theory, which corresponds to the years
  1900 to 1913 \nand could be entitled ' Tracing the quantum by thermodynamical \nand
  statistical methods' . The next chapter deals with the period \n1913-25 when spectroscopical
  and electronic methods were in \nthe foreground, while the last chapter describes
  the birth and \ndevelopment of quantum mechanics. \n\nI cannot possibly give an
  account of this long and tedious \ndevelopment, but I shall pick out a few points
  which are not so \nwell known and hardly found in text-books, beginning with some
  \nremarks on the thermo-statistical quantum hunt. \n\nThe problem which Planck solved
  was the determination of \nthe density of radiation p in equilibrium with matter
  of a given \ntemperature T as function of T and of the frequency v, so that \np(v,T)
  dv is the energy per unit volume in the frequency interval \ndv. By purely thermodynamical
  methods several properties of \nthis function were known: the temperature dependence
  of the \ntotal radiation J p dv = o-T 4 (law of Stefan and Boltzmann) and \nthe
  specification that p/v* is only a function of the quotient vjT.^ \nThe problem remained
  to determine this function, and here \nstatistical methods had to be used. \n\nOne
  can proceed in two ways. Either one regards the radiation \nas being in equilibrium
  with a set of atoms which in their inter- \naction with radiation can be replaced
  by harmonic oscillators; \nthen the mean energy of these can be calculated in terms
  of the \nradiation density and turns out to be proportional to it. This \nwas the
  method preferred by Planck. Or one regards the radia- \n\nf Law of Wien; see Atomic
  Physics, Ch. VII. 1, p. 198; A. XXVII, p. 343. \n\n\n\nMASS, ENERGY, AND RADIATION
  77 \n\ntion itself as a system of oscillators, each of these representing \nthe
  amplitude of a plane wave. This method was used by Ray- \nleigh and later by Jeans.
  In both cases the relation between the \nmean energy u(v) of the oscillators of
  frequency v and the radia- \ntion density p is given byf \n\n877V 2 , QA . \n\np-~jru,
  (8.4) \n\nand it suffices to determine u. \n\nThis can be done with the help of
  the so-called equipartition \nlaw of statistical mechanics. Suppose the Hamiltonian
  H of a \nsystem has the form \n\n(8.5) \n\n\n\nwhere is any coordinate or momentum
  and H' contains all \nthe other coordinates and momenta but not . Then the mean
  \nvalue of the contribution to the energy of this variable is (see \nAppendix, 26)
  , \n\n|^|T, (8.6) \n\nindependent of the constant a hence the same for all variables
  \nof that description. \n\nApplied to a set of oscillators of frequency v, where
  \n\nH = -(p'+^W), (8.7) \n\n\n\none obtains for the average energy \n\nu = kT, (8.8)
  \n\n\n\nhence, from (8.4), p = kT. (8.9) \n\nThis is called the Rayleigh-Jeans radiation
  formula. It is a \nrigorous consequence of classical statistical mechanics, but
  \nnevertheless in obvious contradiction to facts. It does not even \nlead to a finite
  total radiation, since p increases as v 2 with fre- \nquency. The law is, however,
  not quite absurd as it agrees well \nwith measurements for small frequencies (long
  waves) or high \ntemperatures. At the other end of the spectrum, the observed \n\nt
  See Atomic Physics, Ch. VII. 1, p. 201 ; A. XXVIII, p. 347. \n\n\n\n78 MATTER \n\nenergy
  density decreases again, and Wien has proposed for this \nregion an experimental
  law which would correspond to the \nassumption that in (8.4) the oscillator energy
  is of the form \n\nu = u e-^ kT . (8.10) \n\nThis looks very much like a Boltzmann
  distribution. According \nto Wien's displacement law it holds for high values of
  the \n\nSrU \n\n\n\n4- \n\n\n\n\nquotient v/T, and both constants U Q and c must
  be proportional \nto v; but their meaning is obscure. \n\nThis was the situation
  which Planck encountered: two \nlimiting cases given by the formulae (8.8) and (8.10),
  the first \nvalid for large T, the second for small T. Planck set out to dis- \ncover
  a bridging formula; the difficulty of this task can be visual- \nized by looking
  at the two mathematical expressions or the \ncorresponding graphs in Fig. 1. Planck
  decided that the energy \nwas a variable unsuited for interpolation, and he looked
  for \nanother one. He found it in the entropy 8. I shall give here \nhis reasoning
  in a little different form (due to Einstein, 1905), \nwhere the entropy does not
  appear explicitly but the formulae \nof statistical mechanics are used. Starting
  from Boltzmann's \n\n\n\nMASS, ENERGY, AND RADIATION 79 \n\ndistribution law, according
  to which the probability of finding \na system in a state with energy c is proportional
  to e~0 , where \nj8 = I/kT, one can express the mean square fluctuation of the \nenergy
  ^ = ^^ = ? __- 2 \n\nin terms of the average energy e = u itself if the latter is
  given as \nfunction of temperature or of /? (see Appendix, 20.10): \n\n(2F = -^.
  (8.11) \n\nNow this function tt(/J) is known for the two limiting cases: T \nlarge
  or /J small, and T small or j8 large, from (8.8) and (8.10), \n\n/jS- 1 for small
  & \nU e-0<. for large/?. (8J2) \n\n\n\nHence one has \n\n3 ' 2 = 2 ' 8ma11 # , 8
  13> \n\n-*' = eo , large jB. (8J3) \n\nNow Planck argues like this: the two limiting
  cases will corre- \nspond to the preponderance of two different causes, whatever
  \nthey may be. A well-known theorem of statistics says that the \nmean square fluctuations
  due to independent causes are additive. \nLet us assume that the condition of independence
  is here satisfied. \nHence, if both causes act simultaneously, we should have \n\n\n\n.
  (8.14) \n\nThis is a differential equation for u, with the general solution \n\n(8.15)
  \nv ' \n\n\n\nThe constant of integration a must vanish in order to have the \nlimiting
  cases (8.15) all right. Wien's displacement law, accord- \ning to which p/v 8 =
  8iru/c 3 v depends only on T\\v, leads then to \ne == hv, where h is a constant,
  known as Planck's constant. \nThe result is Planck's formula for the mean oscillator
  energy \n\nscri- ^W' < 8 - 16 ' \n\nfrom which the radiation density follows according
  to (8.9); a \n\n\n\n80 MATTER \n\n\n\nrefined interpolation which turned out to
  be in so excellent agree- \nment with experiment that Planck looked for a deeper
  explana- \ntion and discovered it in the assumption of energy quanta of \nfinite
  size e = hv. If the energy is a multiple of e , the integral \n(6.32) has to be
  replaced by the sum \n\n\n\nand then the usual procedure outlined in section 6 leads
  at once \nto the expression (8.16) for the oscillator energy u. \n\nPlanck believed
  that the discontinuity of energy was a pro- \nperty of the atoms, represented by
  oscillators in their interaction \nwith radiation, which itself behaved quite normally.
  Seven \nyears later Einstein showed that indeed wherever oscillations \noccur in
  atomic systems, their energy follows Planck's formula \n(8.16);I refer to his theory
  of specific heat of molecules and solids \nwhich opened more than one new chapter
  of physics. But this \nis outside the scope of these lectures. f \n\nEinstein had,
  however, arrived already in 1905 at the con- \nclusion that radiation itself was
  not as innocent as Planck \nassumed, that the quanta were an intrinsic property
  of radia- \ntion and ought to be imagined to be a kind of particles flying \nabout.
  In text-books this revival of Newton's corpuscular theory \nof light is connected
  with Einstein's explanation of the photo- \nelectric effect and similar phenomena
  where kinetic energy of \nelectrons is produced by light or vice versa. This is
  quite correct, \nbut not the whole story. For it was again a statistical argument
  \nwhich led Einstein to the hypothesis of quanta of light, or \nphotons, as we say
  to-day. \n\nHe considered the two limiting cases (8.13) from a different \npoint
  of view. Suppose the wave theory of light is correct, then \nheat radiation is a
  statistical mixture of harmonic waves of all \ndirections, frequencies, and amplitudes.
  Then one can deter- \nmine the mean energy of the radiation and its fluctuation
  in a \ngiven section of a large volume. This calculation has been per- \nformed
  by the Dutch physicist, H. A. Lorentz, with the result \n\nt See Atomic Physics,
  Ch. VII. 2, p. 207. \n\n\n\nMASS, ENERGY, AND RADIATION 81 \n\nthat (Ap) 2 = p 2
  for any frequency, or expressed in terms of the \nequivalent oscillators, (Ac) 2
  = u 2 , in agreement with the \nRayleigh-Jeans case (small j9, large T) in (8.13).
  Hence there \nmust be something else going on besides the waves, for which \n(Ae)
  2 = u- 9 what can this be? \n\nSuppose Planck's quanta exist really in the radiation
  and let \nn be their number per unit volume and unit frequency interval. \nAs each
  quantum has the energy c = hv, one has e = u = we , \nand (Ae) 2 = (A?i) 2 . Hence
  the fluctuation law in Wien's case \n(large j3, small T) of (8.13) can be written
  as \n\n(Snj* = n. (8.18) \n\nThis is a well-known formula of statistics referring
  to the \nfollowing situation: a great number of objects are distributed at \nrandom
  in a big volume and n is the number contained in a part. \nThen one has just the
  relation (8.18) between the average n \nand its mean square fluctuation (see Appendix,
  20). So Einstein \nwas led to the conclusion that the Wien part of the fluctuation
  \nof energy is accounted for by quanta behaving like independent \nparticles, and
  he corroborated it by taking into account, besides \nthe energy, also the momentum
  hv/c of the quantum and the \nrecoil of an atom produced by it. It was this result
  which en- \ncouraged him to look for experimental evidence and led him to \nthe
  well-known interpretation of the photo-electric effect as a \nbombardment of photons
  which knock out electrons from the \nmetal transferring their energy to them. \n\nExpressed
  in terms of photon numbers the combined fluctua- \ntion law (8.14) reads \n\n\n\n(8.19)
  \nQ \n\nwith the general solution \n\n* - ^n> < 8 - 20 > \n\nwhere a = leads to
  the correct value for large T. But what if \na^O? \n\nEvery physicist glancing at
  the last formula will recognize \nit as the so-called Bose-Einstein distribution
  law for an ideal \n\n\n\n82 MATTER \n\ngas of indistinguishable particles according
  to quantum theory. \nIt is most remarkable that at this early stage of quantum theory
  \nPlanck and Einstein have already hit on a result which was \nrediscovered much
  later (Einstein again participating) (see \nAppendix, 25, 32). In fact Planck's
  interpolation can be inter- \npreted in modern terms as the first and completely
  successful \nattempt to bridge the gulf between the wave aspect and the \nparticle
  aspect of a system of equal and independent components \nwhatever they may be photons
  or atoms. \n\nI shall conclude this section by giving a short account of \nanother
  consideration of Einstein's which belongs to a later \nperiod of quantum theory,
  when Bohr's theory of atoms was \nalready well established, namely the existence
  of stationary \nstates in the atoms which differ by finite amounts of energy \ncontent.
  Suppose the atom can exist in a lower state 1 and a \nhigher state 2; transitions
  are possible by emission or absorp- \ntion of a light quantum of energy 2 1 = ,
  hence of frequency \nv = /h. On the other hand, according to Boltzmann's law \nthe
  relative number of atoms in the two states will be \n\n= e-*'. (8.21) \n\nA/I \n\nNow
  one can write (8.20), with a = 0, in the form \n\nfa = n, \nor, using (8.21), nN
  z +N z = nN v (8.22) \n\nFor this equation Einstein gave the following interpretation:
  \nthe left-hand side represents the number of quanta emitted per \nunit of time
  from the N 2 atoms in the higher state, the right- \nhand side those absorbed by
  the N : atoms in the lower state, \ntwo processes which in equilibrium must of course
  cancel one \nanother. \n\nThe absorption is obviously proportional to the number
  of \natoms in the lower state, N l9 and to the number n of photons \npresent, i.e.
  to nN v Concerning the emission the term N 2 signifies \na spontaneous process,
  independent of the presence of radiation; \nit corresponds to the well-known emission
  of electromagnetic \n\n\n\nMASS, ENERGY, AND RADIATION 83 \n\nwaves by a vibrating
  system of charges. The other term nN 2 is \na new phenomenon which was signalled
  the first time in this paper \nof Einstein (later confirmed experimentally), namely
  a forced \nor induced emission proportional to the number of photons \npresent.
  \n\nIf we denote the number of spontaneous emissions by AN 2> \nof induced emissions
  by B 21 N 2 n, of absorptions B^N t n y we \nlearn from (8.22) that the probability
  coefficients (probabilities \nper unit time, per atom, and per light-quantum) are
  all equal: \n\nA = B 12 = B 2l . (8.23) \n\nThis result had far-reaching consequences.
  The first is the exis- \ntence of a symmetric probability coefficient J5 12 = B
  2 i for transi- \ntion between two states induced by radiation. This became one
  \nof the clues for the discovery of the matrix form of quantum \nmechanics. \n\nThe
  second point is seen if one considers, not equilibrium, but \na process in time;
  Einstein's consideration leads at once to the \nequation \n\n% = f = -f = ^m-*>+*.
  < 8 - 2 *) \n\nwhich is of the type used by the chemists for the calculation of
  \nreaction velocities. One has, in their terminology, three com- \npeting reactions,
  namely two diatomic ones and one monatomic \none. Now genuine monatomic reactions
  are rare in ordinary \nchemistry, but abundant in nuclear chemistry; they were in
  \nfact until recently the only known ones, namely the natural \nradioactive disintegrations.
  If the radiation density is zero, \nn = 0, one has , \n\n-*J! = AN t , (8.25) \n\nwhich
  is exactly the elementary law of radioactive decay, \naccording to Rutherford and
  Soddy . It expresses the assumption \nthat the disintegrations are purely accidental
  and completely \nindependent of one another. \n\nThus Einstein's interpretation
  means the abandonment of \ncausal description and the introduction of the laws of
  chance \nfor the interaction of matter and radiation. \n\n\n\n84 MATTER \n\nELECTRONS
  AND QUANTA \n\nAlthough my programme takes me through the whole history \nof physics,
  I am well aware that it is a very one-sided account of \nwhat really has happened.
  It will not have escaped you that I \nbelieve progress in physics essentially due
  to the inductive \nmethod (of which I hope to say a little more later), yet the
  experi- \nmentalist may rightly complain that his efforts and achieve- \nments are
  hardly mentioned. Yet as I am concerned with the \ndevelopment of ideas and conceptions,
  I may be permitted \nto take the skill and inventive genius of the experimenters
  for \ngranted and to use their results for my purpose without detailed \nacknowledgement.
  \n\nThe period about 1900, when quantum theory sprang from \nthe investigations
  of radiation, was also full of experimental \ndiscoveries: radioactivity, X-rays,
  and the electron, are the \nmajor ones. \n\nIn regard to the role of chance in physics,
  radioactivity was of \nspecial importance. As I said before, the law of decay is
  the \nexpression of independent accidental events. Moreover, the \ndecay constant
  turned out to be perfectly insensitive to all \nphysical influences. There might
  be, of course, some internal \nparameters of the atom which determine when it will
  explode. \nYet the situation is different from that in gas theory: there we \nknow
  the internal parameters, or believe we know them, they \nare supposed to be ordinary
  coordinates and momenta; what \nwe do not know are their actual values at any time,
  and we are \ncompelled to take refuge in statistics because of this lack of \ndetailed
  knowledge. In radioactivity, on the other hand, nobody \nhad an idea what these
  parameters might be, their nature itself \nwas unknown. However, one might have
  kindled the hope that \nthis question would be solved and radioactive statistics
  reduced \nto ordinary statistical mechanics. In fact, just the opposite has \nhappened.
  \n\nRadioactivity is also important for our problem because it \nprovided the means
  of investigating the internal structure of the \natom. You know how Rutherford used
  a-particles as projectiles \nto penetrate into the interior of the atom, and found
  the nucleus. \n\n\n\nELECTBONS AND QUANTA 85 \n\nThis result, together with J. J.
  Thomson's discovery of the elec- \ntron, led to the planetary model of the atom:
  a number of elec- \ntrons surrounding the nucleus, bound to it by electric forces.
  The \nfundamental difficulty of this model is its mechanical instability. \n\nAs
  long as nothing was known about the forces which keep the \nelementary particles
  in an atom together one could assume a \nlaw of force which allowed stable equilibrium
  states. An in- \ngenious model of this kind is due to J. J. Thomson. But now one
  \nknew that the forces were electrostatic ones, following Coulomb's \nlaw, and these
  could never guarantee the extraordinary stability \nof the actual atoms which survive
  billions of collisions without \nany change of structure. Bohr connected this difficulty
  with the \nfacts of spectroscopy, and the result was his well-known model \nof the
  atom consisting of 'quantized' electronic orbits. \n\nMentioning spectroscopy, I
  feel again sadly how I have to \nskip over great fields of research with a few words.
  \n\nThe discovery of simple laws in line spectra was in fact a great \nachievement.
  Still more important than numerical formulae, \nlike the one discovered by the Swiss
  schoolmaster Balmer for \nthe hydrogen spectrum, was the rule found by Ritz (also
  a \nSwiss, who unfortunately died quite young), the so-called com- \nbination principle;
  it says that the frequencies of the spectral \nlines of gases can be obtained by
  forming differences of a single \nrow of quantities T l9 T 2 , jP 3 ,..., which
  are called terms: \n\n>W = ?n-T m , (8.26) \n\nthough not all of these differences
  appear as lines in the spectrum. \nBalmer 5 s formula for hydrogen is a special
  case where T n = Rjn 2 , \nnamely \n\n\n\nThe formula (8.26) gave Bohr the clue
  to the application of \nquantum theory. Multiplying it by Planck's constant h he
  \ninterpreted it as the energy difference e nm = hv nm between any \ntwo stationary
  states having the energies e n hT n (n = 1,2,...). \nThis interpretation is a sweeping
  generalization of Planck's \noriginal conception of discrete energy-levels of oscillators.
  It \nexplained at once the stability of atoms against impacts with an \n\n\n\n86
  MATTER \n\nenergy smaller than a certain threshold, the difference between \nemission
  and absorption spectra (the latter being of the form \nhv nl = n v where 1 means
  the ground state), and was in \ndetail confirmed by the well-known experiments of
  Pranck and \nHertz (excitation of spectra by electron bombardment). \n\nHowever,
  I cannot continue to describe the whole develop- \nment of quantum theory because
  that would mean writing an \nencyclopaedia of physics of the last thirty-five years.
  I have \ngiven this short account of the initial period because it is fashion- \nable
  to-day to regard physics as the product of pure reason. \nNow I am not so unreasonable
  as to say that physics could \nproceed by experiment only, without some hard thinking,
  nor \ndo I deny that the forming of new concepts is guided to some \ndegree by general
  philosophical principles. But I know from my \nown experience, and I could call
  on Heisenberg for confirmation, \nthat the laws of quantum mechanics were found
  by a slow and \ntedious process of interpreting experimental results. I shall try
  to \ndescribe the main steps of this process in the shortest possible way. \n\nYet
  it must be remembered that these steps do not form a \nstraight staircase upwards,
  but a tangle of interconnected alleys. \nHowever, I must begin somewhere. \n\nThere
  was first the question whether the stationary states are \ncertain selected mechanical
  orbits, and if so, which. Proceeding \nfrom example to example (oscillator, rotator,
  hydrogen atom), \n'quantum conditions' were found (Bohr, Wilson, Sommerfeld) \nwhich
  for every periodic coordinate q of the motion can be \nexpressed in the form \n\nI
  =:pdq = hn, (8.27) \n\nwhere p is the momentum corresponding to q and the integration
  \nextended over a period. The most convincing theoretical \nargument for choosing
  these integrals / was given by Ehrenfest, \nwho showed that if the system is subject
  to a slow external per- \nturbation, / is an invariant and therefore well suited
  to be \nequated to a discontinuous 'jumping' quantity Tin. \n\nAmong these 'adiabatic
  invariants' / there is in particular the \nangular momentum of a rotating system
  and its component in a \n\n\n\nELECTRONS AND QUANTA 87 \n\ngiven direction; if both
  are to be integer multiples of h, the strange \nconclusion is obtained that an atom
  could not exist in all orienta- \ntions but only in a selected finite set. This
  was confirmed by \nStern and Gerlach's celebrated experiment (deflecting an \natomic
  beam in an inhomogeneous magnetic field). I am proud \nthat this work was done in
  my department in Frankfort-on- \nMain. There is hardly any other effect which demonstrates
  the \ndeviations from classical mechanics in so striking a manner. \n\nA signpost
  for further progress was Bohr's correspondence \nprinciple. It says that, though
  ordinary mechanics does not \napply to atomic processes, we must expect that it
  holds at least \napproximately for large quantum numbers. This was not so \nmuch
  philosophy as common sense. Yet in the hands of Bohr \nand his school it yielded
  a rich harvest of results, beginning with \nthe calculation of the constant M in
  the Balmer formula. f The \nmysterious laws of spectroscopy were reduced to a few
  general \nrules about the energy -levels and the transitions between them. \nThe
  most important of these rules was Pauli's exclusion prin- \nciple, derived from
  a careful discussion of simple spectra; it says \nthat two or more electrons are
  never in the same quantum state, \ndescribed by fixed values of the quantum numbers
  (8.27) \nbelonging to all periods, including the electronic spin (Uhlenbeck \nand
  Goudsmit). With the help of these simple principles the \nperiodic system of the
  elements could be explained in terms of \nelectronic states. But all these great
  achievements of Bohr's \ntheory are outside the scope of our present interest. I
  have, \nhowever, to mention Bohr's considerations about the correspon- \ndence between
  the amplitudes of the harmonic components of a \nmechanical orbit and the intensity
  of certain spectral lines. \nConsider an atom in the quantum state n with energy
  c n and \nsuppose the orbit can be, for large n, approximately described \nby giving
  the coordinates q as functions of time. As these will \nbe periodic, one can represent
  q as a harmonic (Fourier) series, \nof the type \n\n<?(*) = f o ro ()cos[2 w ()M+S
  m )], (8.28) \n\nm=l \nt See Atomic Physics, Ch. V. 1, p. 98; A. XIV, p. 300. \n\n\n\n88
  MATTER \n\nwhere the fundamental frequency v(n) and the amplitudes \na m (n) depend
  on the number n of the orbit considered. In reality, \nthe frequencies observed
  are not v(ri), 2v(n), 3i>(n),... but \n\n_!/ _ v \n\nv nm % \\ n m/ \n\nand what
  about the amplitudes ? It was clear that the squares \n\\a m (ri) | 2 should correspond
  in some way to the transition prob- \nabilities B nm = B mn introduced by Einstein
  in his derivation \nof Planck's radiation law (8.16). But how could the mth over-
  \ntone of the nth orbit be associated with the symmetric relation \nbetween two
  states m, n ? \n\nThis was the central problem of quantum physics in the years \nbetween
  1913 and 1925. In particular there arose a great interest \nin measuring intensities
  of spectral lines, with the help of newly- \ninvented recording micro-photometers.
  Simple laws for the \nintensities of the component lines of multiplets were discovered
  \n(Ornstein, Moll), and presented in quadratic tables which look \nso much like
  matrices that it is hard to understand why this \nassociation of ideas did not happen
  in some brain. \n\nIt did not happen because the mind of the physicist was still
  \nworking on classical lines, and it needed a special effort to get \nrid of this
  bias. One had to give up the idea of a coordinate \nbeing a function of time, represented
  by a Fourier series like \n(8.28); one had to omit the summation in this formula
  and to \ntake the set of unconnected terms as representative of the \ncoordinate.
  Then it became possible to replace the Fourier \namplitudes a m (n) by quantum amplitudes
  a(m,n) with two \nequivalent indices m, n, and to generalize the multiplication
  law \nfor Fourier-coefficients into that for matricesf \n\n* c ( m > n ) = 2 a (
  m > k ) b ( k > n )' ( 8 - 29 ) \n\n\n\nHeisenberg justified the rejection of traditional
  concepts by a \ngeneral methodological principle: a satisfactory theory should \nuse
  no quantities which do not correspond to anything ob- \nservable. The classical
  frequencies mv(ri) and the whole idea of \norbits have this doubtful character.
  Therefore one should \n\nf See Atomic Physics, Ch. V. 3, p. 123; A. XV, p. 305.
  \n\n\n\nELECTRONS AND QUANTA 89 \n\neliminate them from the theory and introduce
  instead the \nquantum frequencies v nm = A~ 1 ( n c m ), while the orbits should
  \nbe completely abandoned. \n\nThis suggestion of Heisenberg has been much admired
  as the \nroot of the success of quantum mechanics. Attempts have been \nmade to
  use it as a guide in overcoming the difficulties which \nhave meanwhile turned up
  in physics (in the application of \nquantum methods to field theories and ultimate
  particles); yet \nwith little success. Now quantum mechanics itself is not free
  \nfrom unobservable quantities. (The wave-function of SchrO- \ndinger, for instance,
  is not observable, only the square of its \nmodulus.) To rid a theory of all traces
  of such redundant con- \ncepts would lead to unbearable clumsiness. I think, though
  \nthere is much to be said for cleaning a theory in the way recom- \nmended by Heisenberg,
  the success depends entirely on scientific \nexperience, intuition, and tact. \n\nThe
  essence of the new quantum mechanics is the representa- \ntion of physical quantities
  by matrices, i.e. by mathematical \nentities which can be added and multiplied according
  to well- \nknown rules just like simple numbers, with the only difference \nthat
  the product is non-commutative. For instance, the quan- \ntum conditions (8.27)
  can be transcribed as the commutation law \n\n(8.30) \n\nThe Hamiltonian form of
  mechanics can be preserved by re- \nplacing all quantities by the corresponding
  matrices. In par- \nticular the determination of stationary states can be reduced
  \nto finding matrices q,p for which the Hamiltonian H(p,q) \nas a matrix has only
  diagonal elements which are then the energy- \nlevels of the states. In order to
  obtain the connexion with \nPlanck's theory of radiation, the squares \\q(m,n)\\*
  have to be \ninterpreted as Einstein's coefficients B mn . In this way a few \nsimple
  examples could be satisfactorily treated. But matrix \nmechanics applies obviously
  only to closed systems with discrete \nenergy-levels, not to free particles and
  collision problems. \n\nThis restriction was removed by SchrOdinger's wave mechan-
  \nics which sprang quite independently from an idea of de Broglie \n\n\n\n90 MATTER
  \n\nabout the application of quantum theory to free particles. It is \nwidely held
  that de Broglie's work is a striking example of the \npower of the human mind to
  find natural laws by pure reason, \nwithout recourse to observation. I have not
  taken part in the \nbeginnings of wave mechanics, as I have in matrix mechanics,
  \nand cannot speak therefore from my own experience. Yet I \nthink that not a single
  step would have been possible if some \nnecessary foothold in facts had been missing.
  To deny this \nwould mean to maintain that Planck's discovery of the quantum \nand
  Einstein's theory of relativity were products of pure think- \ning. They were interpretations
  of facts of observation, solutions \nof riddles given by Nature difficult riddles
  indeed, which only \ngreat thinkers could solve. \n\nDe Broglie observed that in
  relativity the energy of a particle \nis not a scalar, but the fourth component
  of a vector in space- \ntime, whose other components represent the momentum p; on
  \nthe other hand, the frequency v of a plane harmonic wave is also \nthe fourth
  component of a space-time vector, whose other \ncomponents represent the wave vector
  k (having the direction \nof the wave normal and the length A\" 1 , where A is the
  wave- \nlength). Now if Planck postulates that = Jiv, one is compelled \nto assume
  also p = hk. For light waves where Ai/ = c, this had \nalready been done by Einstein,
  who spoke of photons behaving \nlike darts with the momentum p = e/c = hv/c. De
  Broglie \napplied it to electrons where the relation between e and p is \nmore complicated,
  namely obtained from (8.3) by eliminating \nthe velocity v: \n\n(8.31) \n\n\n\nIf
  a particle (c,p) is always accompanied by a wave (v, k) the \nphase velocity of
  the wave would be (using e = me 2 , p = mv) \n\nv \\ = v /k = /p = c 2 /v > c, (8.32)
  \n\napparently an impossible result, as the principle of relativity \nexcludes velocities
  larger than that of light. But de Broglie \nwas not deterred by this; he observed
  that the prohibition of \nvelocities larger than c refers only to such motions which
  can be \nused for sending time-signals. That is impossible by means \n\n\n\nELECTRONS
  AND QUANTA 91 \n\nof a monochromatic wave. For a signal one must have a small \ngroup
  of waves, the velocity of which can be obtained, according \nto Rayleigh, by differentiating
  frequency with respect to wave \nnumber. Thus, from (8.31) and (8.32), f \n\n\n\na
  most satisfactory result which completely justifies the formal \nconnexion of particles
  and waves, though the physical meaning \nof this connexion was still mysterious.
  \n\nThis reasoning is indeed a stroke of genius, yet not a triumph \nof a priori
  principles, but of an extraordinary capacity for com- \nbining and unifying remote
  subjects. \n\nI should say the same about the work of Schrftdinger and Dirac, \nbut
  you could better ask them directly what they think about the \nroots of their discoveries.
  I shall not describe them here in detail, \nbut indicate some threads to other facts
  or theories. Schr5dinger \nsays that he was stimulated by a remark of de Broglie
  that any \nperiodic motion of an electron must correspond to a whole \nnumber of
  waves of the corresponding wave motion. This led \nhim to his wave equation whose
  eigenvalues are the energy- \nlevels of stationary states. He was further guided
  by the analogy \nof mechanics and optics known from Hamilton's investigations; \nthe
  relation of wave mechanics to ordinary mechanics is the \nsame as that of undulating
  optics to geometrical optics. Then, \nlooking out for a connexion of wave mechanics
  with matrix \nmechanics, Schr6dinger recognized as the essential feature of a \nmatrix
  that it represents a linear operator acting on a vector \n(one-column matrix), and
  came in this way to his operator cal- \nculus (see Appendix, 27) ; if a coordinate
  q is taken as an ordinary \nvariable and the corresponding momentum as the operator
  \n\n\n\nthe commutation law (8.30) becomes a trivial identity. Apply- \ning the
  theory of sets of ortho-normal functions, he could then \nestablish the exact relation
  between matrix and wave mechanics. \n\nf See Atomic Physics, Ch. IV. 5, p. 84; A.
  XI, p. 295. \n\n\n\n92 MATTER \n\nIt is most remarkable that the whole story has
  been developed \nby Dirac from Heisenberg's first idea by an independent and \nformally
  more general method based on the abstract concept of \nnon-commuting quantities
  (^-numbers). \n\nThe growth of quantum mechanics out of three independent \nroots
  uniting to a single trunk is strong evidence for the inevita- \nbility of its concepts
  in view of the experimental situation. \n\nFrom the standpoint of these lectures
  on cause and chance it \nis not the formalism of quantum mechanics but its interpretation
  \nwhich is of importance. Yet the formalism came first, and was \nwell secured before
  it became clear what it really meant: nothing \nmore or less than a complete turning
  away from the predomi- \nnance of cause (in the traditional sense, meaning essentially
  \ndeterminism) to the predominance of chance. \n\nThis revolution of outlook goes
  back to a tentative interpreta- \ntion which Einstein gave of the coexistence of
  light waves and \nphotons. He spoke of the waves being a 'ghost field' which has
  \nno ordinary physical meaning but whose intensity determines \nthe probability
  of the appearance of photons. This idea could be \ntransferred to the relation of
  electrons (and of material particles \nin general) t<fde Broglie's waves. With the
  help of SchrOdinger's \nwave equation, the scattering of particles by obstacles,
  the excita- \ntion laws of atoms under electron bombardment, and other \nsimilar
  phenomena could be calculated with results which con- \nfirmed the assumption. \n\nI
  shall now describe the present situation of the theory in a \nformulation due to
  Dirac which is well adapted to comparing the \nnew statistical physics with the
  old deterministic one. \n\n\n\nIX \n\nCHANCE \nQUANTUM MECHANICS \n\nIN quantum
  mechanics physical quantities or observables are \nnot represented by ordinary variables,
  but by symbols which \nhave no numerical values but determine the possible values
  of \nthe observable in a definite way to be described presently. These \nsymbols
  can be added and multiplied with the proviso that \nmultiplication is non-commutative:
  AB is in general different \nfrom BA. I cannot deal with the most general aspect
  of this \nsymbolic calculus, but shall consider a special representation, \nnamely
  that where the coordinates #i,#2>-\"> of the particles are \nregarded as ordinary
  numbers. Then a definite state of a system \nis defined by a function ^(#i,32---)>
  an( ^ an bservable A can be \nrepresented by a linear operator: Aifj(q) means a
  new function \n<f>(q), the result of operating with A on 0. If this result is, apart
  \nfrom a factor, identical with ^, \n\nA$ = aifj, (9.1) \n\n</f is called an eigenf
  unction of A and the constant a an eigenvalue. \nThe whole set of eigenvalues is
  characteristic for the operator \nA and represents the possible numerical values
  of the observable, \nwhich may be continuous or discontinuous. \n\nThe coordinates
  q themselves can be considered to be opera- \ntors, namely multiplication operators:
  q a operating on \\jj \nmeans multiplying by q a . Operators whose eigenvalues are
  \nall real numbers are called realtor TEteimitian*) operators. It \nis clear that
  aH physical quantities have to be represented by real \noperators, as the eigenvalues
  are supposed to represent the pos- \nsible results of measuring a physical quantity.
  One can easily \nsee that not only the multiplication operators q a but also the
  \n\nft ft \nmomenta p ot = ~ are real. But for the formal argument one \n\n* lat
  \n\ncan also use complex operators, of the form C == A+iB (where \ni = V 1), and
  its conjugate (7* = A%B\\ then CC* can be \n\n\n\n94 CHANCE \n\nshown to be a real
  operator with only positive (or zero) eigen- \nvalues. \n\nIf two observables are
  represented by non- commuting opera- \ntors, A and J?, their eigenfunctions are
  not all identical; if a is \nan eigenvalue of A belonging to such an eigenfunction,
  there is \nno state of the system for which a measurement can result in \nfinding
  simultaneously for A and B sharp numerical values a \nand 6. \n\nThe theory cannot
  therefore in general predict definite \nvalues of all physical properties, but only
  probability laws. \nThe same experiment, repeated under identical and controllable
  \nconditions, may result in finding for a quantity A so many \ntimes a v so many
  times a 2 , etc., and for B in the same way b \nor 6 2 > e tc. But the average of
  repeated measurements must be \npredictable. Whatever the rule for constructing
  the number \nwhich represents the average A of the measurements of A, it \nmust,
  by common sense, have the properties that A+B = A + B \nand cZ = cA, if c is any
  number. \n\nFrom this alone there follows an important result. Consider \napart
  from the averages A, B of two operators A, B also their \nmean square deviations,
  or the 'spreading' of the measurements, \n\n\n\n8^ = J{(AA)*}, 8B = V{(--B) 2 },

  how a narrowing of the range for the measured \ng-values widens the range for p.
  The same holds, according to \n(9.3), for any two non-commuting observables with
  the differ- \nence that the 'uncertainty' depends on the mean of the oommu- \ntator,^
  \n\nThese general considerations are, so to speak, the kinematical \npart of quantum
  mechanics. Now we turn to the dynamical \npart. \n\nJust as in classical mechanics,
  the dynamical behaviour of a \nsystem of particles is described by a Hamiltonian
  \n\n\n\nwhich is a (differential) operator. It is usually just taken over \nfrom
  classical mechanics (where, if necessary, products like pq \nhave to be 'symmetrized'
  into %(pq+qp)). In Dirac's relativistic \ntheory of the electron there are, apart
  from the space coordinates, \nobservables representing the spin (and similar quantities
  in \nmeson theory); they lead to no fundamental difficulty and will \nnot be considered
  here. \n\nYet one remark about the Hamiltonian H has to be made, \nbearing on our
  general theme of cause and chance: H contains \nin the potential energy (and in
  corresponding electromagnetic \ninteraction terms) the last vestiges of Newton's
  conception of \nforce, or, using the traditional expression, of causation. We \nhave
  to remember this point later. \n\nIn classical mechanics we have used a formulation
  of the laws \nof motion which applies just as well to a simple system, where all
  \ndetails of the motion are of interest, as to a system of numerous \nparticles,
  where only statistical results are desired (and possible). \nA function f(t,p,q)
  of time and of all coordinates and momenta \nwas considered; if p,q change with
  time according to the equa- \ntions of motion, the total change of/ is given by
  \n\n\n\n96 CHANCE \n\nwhere [H t f] is the Poisson bracket \n\n07) \n- (9>7) \n\n\n\ni
  \n\nOne recovers the canonical equations by taking for / \nsimply q k or p k respectively.
  On the other hand, if one puts \ndf/dt = 0, any solution of this equation is an
  integral of the \nequations of motion, and from a sufficient number of such \nintegrals
  fk(t,p,q) = c k one can obtain the complete solution \ngiving all p y q as functions
  of t. \n\nBut if this is not required, the same equation is also the means \nfor
  obtaining statistical information in terms of a solution /, \ncalled the * distribution
  function', as I have described in detail. \n/ is that integral of ^ /. \n\nf = [H,n,
  (9-8) \n\nwhich for t = goes over into a given initial distribution f (p, q). \nIf,
  in particular, this latter function vanishes except in the \nneighbourhood of a
  given point p , q Q in phase space, or, in Dirac's \nnotation, if / = 8(p p^Siqqo),
  one falls back to the case of \ncomplete knowledge, g and p Q being the initial
  values of q and p. \nThis procedure cannot be transferred without alteration to
  \nquantum mechanics for the simple reason that p and q cannot \nbe simultaneously
  given fixed values. The uncertainty relation \n(9.5) forbids the prescribing of
  sharp initial values for all p and q. \nHence the first part of the programme, namely
  a complete \nknowledge of the motion in the same sense as in classical mechan- \nics,
  breaks down right from the beginning. Yet the second part, \nstatistical prediction,
  remains possible. Following Dirac, we \nask which quantities have to replace the
  Poisson brackets (9.7) \nin quantum theory, where all quantities are in general
  non- \ncommuting. These brackets [a, /?] have a number of algebraic \nproperties;
  the most important of them being \n\n[, A+A] = [, Al+[. A]. (9 9) \n\n[,AA1 = A[,A]+[,A]A.
  \n\nIf one postulates that these shall hold also for non-commuting \nquantities
  a and /?, provided the order of factors is always \n\n\n\nQUANTUM MECHANICS 97 \n\npreserved
  (as it is in (9.9)), then it can be shown (Appendix, 29) \nthat [a,jS] is exactly
  the commutator as defined by (9.4). \n\nNow one has to replace the function / in
  (9.8) by a time- \ndependent operator p, called the statistical operator, and to
  \ndetermine p from the equation (formally identical with (9.8)): \n\n% = [B, P ]
  (9.10) \n\nwith suitable initial conditions. To express these in a simple \nway
  it is convenient to represent all operators by matrices in \nthe g-space; A operating
  on a function iff(q) is defined by \n\nAj(q) = j A(q,q'W(q') dq' (9.11) \n\n(q stands
  for all coordinates ? 1> 9 8 > > an( * ?' ^ or another set of \nvalues <?i,#2,...)
  where A(q,q') is called the matrix represent- \ning A. \n\nThe product AB is represented
  by the matrix \n\nA B(q, q') = J A (q, q\")B(q\", q') dq\". (9.12) \n\nIf now p
  and H are taken as such matrices, where the elements \nof p depend also on time,
  (9.10) is a differential equation for \np(t,q y q'), and the initial conditions
  are simply \n\np(o,g,?') = Po(?,fia (9-13) \n\nwhere p is a given function of the
  two sets of variables. \n\nThe number of vector arguments in p for a system of N
  par- \nticles is 2N, exactly as in the case of classical theory in the func- \ntion
  f(p,q). But while the meaning of/ depending on p,q is \nobvious, that of p depending
  on two sets q, q' is not, except in \none case, namely when the two sets are identical,
  q = q'; then \nthe function P (t,q,q) = n(t,q) (9.14) \n\nis the number density,
  corresponding to the classical \njf(t>3>P)dp = n(t,q). \n\nQuite generally, the
  classical operation of integrating over the p'& \nis replaced by the simpler operation
  of equating the two sets \nofj's, q = q r , or in matrix language, taking the diagonal
  elements \nof p. \n\n\n\n6131 \n\n\n\nM CHANCE \n\nThe average of an observable
  A for a configuration q must be \na real number A formed from p and A so that nA
  is linear in both \noperators. The simplest expression of this kind is \n\nnl =
  HpA+Ap)^, (9.15) \n\nand this gives, in fact, all results of quantum mechanics usually
  \nobtained with the help of the wave function. For instance, the \nstatistical matrix
  describing a stationary state where A has a \nsharp value a, belonging to the eigenfunction
  *jj(a,q), is \n\np^t(a,qW*(a,q'). (9.16) \n\nThen, from the definition (9.12) it
  follows easily that for this p \nand any real operator A one has \n\nAp = P A =
  ap, (9.17) \n\nhence for q = q', with (9.14), \n\nn(a,q)= |0(a,g)| 2 , I = a. (9.18)
  \n\nThus we have obtained the usual assumption that | </>(#, #)| 2 \nis the 'probability'
  (if normalized to 1) or 'number density* \n(if normalized to N) at the point q for
  the state a. (It must, \nhowever, be noted that for systems of numerous particles,
  like \nliquids in motion, other ways of averaging are useful, for instance \nfor
  the square of a momentum instead of np* = ^(pp 2 +p 2 p) Q ^^ \nthe expression ^ipp^+p^p+Zppp)^?,
  which, however, for uni- \nform conditions coincides with the former.) \n\nLet us
  consider the general stationary case where p is inde- \npendent of time and therefore
  satisfies \n\n[#,p] = 0. (9.19) \n\nAny solution of this equation, i.e. any quantity
  A which com- \nmutes with H 9 is called an integral of the motion, in analogy to
  \nthe corresponding classical conception. H itself is, of course, an \nintegral.
  All integrals A a , A 2 ,..., have different eigenvalues \nA x , A 2 ,..., for one
  and the same eigenfunction ^(Aj, A 2 ,...; #i>3 2 ,...) \nor shortly ^(A, q) : \n\nA
  1 = A 1 0, A 2 ^ = A 2 ^, .... (9.20) \n\np can be taken as any function of the
  A's; its matrix representa- \ntion is given by \n\nP(9, 9') = \n\n\n\nQUANTUM MECHANICS
  99 \n\nfrom which one obtains, with (9.18), \n\nn(q) = />(?,?) = I P(A)|</r(A,g)|*
  = J P(A)n(A,g). (9.22) \n\nA A \n\nThis shows that the arbitrary coefficient P(A)
  is the probability! \nof finding the system in the stationary state A. \n\nDynamical
  problems arise in a somewhat different way from \nthose in classical theory. There
  it has a definite meaning to \nspeak about the motion of particles in a closed system,
  for \ninstance of the orbit of Jupiter in the planetary system. In \nquantum theory
  a closed system settles down in a definite \nstationary state, or a mixture of such
  states as given by (9.21). \nBut then nothing is changing in time; one cannot even
  make an \nobservation without interfering with the state of the system. \nIn classical
  physics it is supposed that we have to do with an \nobjective and always observable
  situation; the process of measur- \ning is assumed to have no influence on the object
  of observation. \nI have, however, drawn your attention to the point that even \nin
  classical physics this postulate is practically never fulfilled \nbecause of the
  Brownian motion which affects the instruments. \nWe are therefore quite prepared
  to find that the assumption of \n'harmless' observations is impossible. \n\nThe
  most general way of formulating a dynamical problem is \nto split the Hamiltonian
  in two parts \n\nH = H +V, (9.23) \n\nwhere jff describes what is of interest while
  V is of minor impor- \ntance, a so-called perturbation. F may also include external
  \ninfluences and depend explicitly on the time. This partition is, \nof course,
  arbitrary to a high degree; but it corresponds to the \nactual situation. If a water
  molecule H 2 O is assembled from its \natoms, one can either ask what the stationary
  states of the whole \nsystem are, or one can consider the parts H 2 and O and ask
  how \nthe states of the hydrogen molecule H 2 are changed by the \napproaching oxygen
  atom, or one can ask the same question \nfor the HO radical and the H atom. The
  latter two are dynamical \nproblems. \n\nDynamical problems in quantum theory therefore,
  in contrast \nto those in classical theory, cannot be defined withouta subjective,
  \n\n\n\n100 CHANCE \n\nmore or less arbitrary decision about what you are interested
  \nin. In other words, quantum mechanics does not describe an \nobjective state in
  an independent external world, but the aspect \nof this world gained by considering
  it from a certain subjective \nstandpoint, or with certain experimental means and
  arrange- \nments. This statement has produced much controversy, and \nthough it
  is generally accepted by the present generation of \nphysicists it has been decidedly
  rejected by just those two men \nwho have done more for the creation of quantum
  physics than \nanybody else, Planck and Einstein. Yet, with all respect, I \ncannot
  agree with them. In fact, the assumption of absolute \nobservability which is the
  root of the classical concepts seems to \nme only to exist in imagination, as a
  postulate which cannot be \nsatisfied in reality. \n\nAssuming the partition (9.23)
  one has to describe the system in \nterms of the integrals of motion A l5 A 2 ,...
  of H Q which are, how- \never, not integrals of motion of H. All operators are then
  to be \nexpressed as matrices in the eigenvalues A (A 1? A 2 ,...) of A x , A 2
  ,...; \nfor instance, the statistical operator p by the matrix p(t; A, A'). \nThe
  diagonal elements of this matrix \n\nP(*; A) = />(*; A, A) (9.24) \n\nrepresent
  the probability of a state A at time , and they go over \nfor t = into the coefficients
  P(A) which appear in the expansion \n(9.21) and represent the initial probabilities.
  The function \np(t\\ A, A') can be determined from the differential equation (9.10)
  \nby a method of successive approximations. My collaborator, \nGreen, has even found
  an elegant formula representing the com- \nplete solution. To a second approximation
  one finds \n\nP(t,X) = P(A)+2 -/(A,A'){P(A')-P(A)}+...; (9.25) \n\n\n\n(9.26) \n\n\n\nthe
  coefficients are given by \n\n\n\nJ(A,A') = \n\n\n\nt \n1 \n\n\n\nfF(; A, * \n\n\n\nwhere
  E is the energy of the unperturbed s^en^in the state A, \nE' that in the state A'
  (see Appendix, 30). \n\n\n\nQUANTUM MECHANICS 101 \n\nNow equation (9.25) has precisely
  the form of the laws of radio- \nactive decay, or of a set of competing mono-molecular
  reactions. \nThe matrix J(A,A') obviously represents the probability of a \ntransition
  or jump from the state A to the state A'. This inter- \npretation becomes still
  more evident if one assumes that the \nA- values are practically continuous, as
  would be the case if the \nsystem allowed particles to fly freely about (for instance
  in radio- \nactivity one has to take account of the emitted a-particles; in the
  \ntheory of optical properties of an atom of the photons emitted \nand absorbed).
  If external influences are excluded, so that F \ndoes not depend on time, the integral
  (9.26) can be worked out \nwith the result that J becomes proportional to the time
  \n\nJ(A,A')=j(A,A% (9.27) \n\nwhere j(X 9 A') = ^ \\V(X,\\')\\*S(E-E'). (9.28) \n\nn
  \n\nThe last factor 8(EE') says that j(A, A') differs from zero for \ntwo states
  A and A' only if their energy is equal. /(A, A') is \nobviously the transition probability
  per unit time, precisely \nthe quantity used in radioactivity. \n\nBy applying the
  formula (9.25) to the case of the interaction \nof an atom with an electromagnetic
  field one obtains the formula \n(8.24) which was used by Einstein in his derivation
  of Planck's \nradiation law. There are innumerable similar applications, such \nas
  the calculation of the effective cross-sections of various kinds \nof collision
  processes, which have provided ample confirmation \nof the formula (9.25). \n\nINDETERMINISTTC
  PHYSICS \n\nThere is no doubt that the formalism of quantum mechanics \nand its
  statistical interpretation are extremely successful in \nordering and predicting
  physical experiences. But can our \n3esire o. understanding, our wish to explain
  things, be satisfied \nby a theorj^^^hich is frankly and shamelessly statistical
  and \nindeterministic ran we be content with accepting chance, not \ncause, as the
  supreme law of the physical world ? \n\nTo this last question I answer that not
  causality, properly \nunderstood, is eliminated, but only a traditional interpretation
  \n\n\n\n102 CHANCE \n\nof it, consisting in its identification with determinism.
  I have \ntaken pains to show that these two concepts are not identical. \nCausality
  in my definition is the postulate that one physical \nsituation depends on the other,
  and causal research means the \ndiscovery of such dependence. This is still true
  in quantum \nphysics, though the objects of observation for which a depen- \ndence
  is claimed are different: they are the probabilities of \nelementary events, not
  those single events themselves. \n\nIn fact, the statistical matrix p, from which
  these probabilities \nare derived, satisfied a differential equation which is essentially
  \nof the same type as the classical field equations for elastic or \nelectromagnetic
  waves. For instance, if one multiplies the \neigenfunction i/j(q) of the Hamiltonian
  H, Hift = EI/J, by e iEtln , \nthe new function satisfies \n\n-?|==^- (9 ' 29) \n\nFor
  a free particle, where H = -L (pl+p$+pl) = J^- A, (9.29) \ngoes over into the wave
  equation \n\nA* (9-30) \n\nAlthough here only the first derivative with respect
  to time \nappears, it does not differ essentially from the ordinary wave \n\n/ 1
  r)2JL\\ \n\nequation j where the left-hand side is ~ ^ \\ . One must remember \n\ny
  C ut J \n\nthat only <fxf>* = |<| 2 has a physical meaning (as a probability), \nwhere
  ^* satisfies the conjugate complex equation \n\n\n\n_ ^ \n\nH dt \n\nFor this pair
  of equations a change in the time direction (t -> t) \ncan be compensated by exchanging
  < and <*, which has no in- \nfluence on <<*. \n\nThe same holds in the general case
  (9.29), and we see that the \njtjiff erential equations of the wave function share
  the property \nof all classical field equations that the principle of antecedence
  \n\n\n\nINDETEBMINISTIC PHYSICS 103 \n\nis violated: there is no distinction between
  past and future for \nthe spreading of the probability density. On the other hand,
  the \nprinciple of contiguity is obviously satisfied. \n\nThe differential equation
  itself is constructed in a way very \nsimilar to the classical equations of motion.
  It contains in the \npotential energy, which is part of the Hamiltonian, the classical
  \nidea of force, or in other words, the Newtonian quantitative \nexpression for
  causation. If, for instance, particles are acting \non one another with a Coulomb
  force (as the nucleus and the \nelectrons in an atom), there appears in H the same
  timeless action \nover finite distance as in Newtonian mechanics. Yet one has the
  \nfeeling that these vestiges of classical causality are provisional \nand will
  be replaced in a future theory by something more satis- \nfactory; in fact, the
  difficulties which the application of quantum \nmechanics to elementary particles
  encounters are connected with \nthe interaction terms in the Hamiltonian; they are
  obviously still \ntoo * classical'. But these questions are outside the scope of
  my \nlectures. \n\nWe have the paradoxical situation that observable events obey
  \nlaws of chance, but that the probability for these events itself \nspreads according
  to laws which are in all essential features \ncausal laws. \n\nHere the question
  of reality cannot be avoided. What really \nare those particles which, as it is
  often said, can just as well \nappear as waves ? It would lead me far from my subject
  to discuss \nthis very difficult problem. I think that the concept of reality is
  \ntoo much connected with emotions to allow a generally accept- \nable definition.
  For most people the real things are those things \nwhich are important for them.
  The reality of an artist or a poet \nis not comparable with that of a saint or prophet,
  nor with that \nof a business man or administrator, nor with that of the natural
  \nphilosopher or scientist. So let me cling to the latter kind of \nspecial reality,
  which can be described in fairly precise terms. \nIt presupposes that our sense
  impressions are not a permanent \nhallucination, but the indications of, or signals
  from, an external \nworld which exists independently of us. Although these signals
  \nchange and move in a most bewildering way, we are aware o \n\n\n\n104 CHANCE \n\nobjects
  with invariant properties. The set of these invariants of \nour sense impressions
  is the physical reality which our mind \nconstructs in a perfectly unconscious way.
  This chair here looks \ndifferent with each movement of my head, each twinkle of
  my \neye, yet I perceive it as the same chair. Science is nothing else \nthan the
  endeavour to construct these invariants where they are \nnot obvious. If you are
  not a trained scientist and look through \na microscope you see nothing other than
  specks of light and \ncolour, not objects; you have to apply the technique of biological
  \nscience, consisting in altering conditions, observing correlations, \netc., to
  learn that what you see is a tissue with cancer cells, or \nsomething like that.
  The words denoting things are applied to \npermanent features of observation or
  observational invariants. \n\nIn physics this method has been made precise by using
  mathe- \nmatics. There the invariant against transformation is an exact \nnotion.
  Felix Klein in his celebrated JErlanger Programm has \nclassified the whole of mathematics
  according to this idea, and \nthe same could be done for physics. \n\nFrom this
  standpoint I maintain that the particles are real, \nas they represent invariants
  of observation. We believe in the \n'existence' of the electron because it has a
  definite charge e and a \ndefinite mass m and a definite spin s; that means in whatever
  \ncircumstances and experimental conditions you observe an effect \nwhich theory
  ascribes to the presence of electrons you find for \nthese quantities, e, m, s,
  the same numerical values. \n\nWhether you can now, on account of these results,
  imagine \nthe electron like a tiny grain of sand, having a definite position in
  \nspace, that is another matter. In fact you can, even in quantum \ntheory. What
  you cannot do is to suppose it also to have a \ndefinite velocity at the same time;
  that is impossible according to \nthe uncertainty relation. Though in our everyday
  experience \nwe can ascribe to ordinary bodies definite positions and velocities,
  \nthere is no reason to assume the same for dimensions which are \nbelow the limits
  of everyday experience. \n\nPosition and velocity are not invariants of observation.
  But \nthey are attributes of the idea of a particle, and we must use \nthem as soon
  as we have made up our minds to describe certain \n\n\n\nINDETERMINISTIC PHYSICS
  105 \n\nphenomena in terms of particles. Bohr has stressed the point that \nour
  language is adapted to our intuitional concepts. We cannot \navoid using these even
  where they fail to have all the properties \nof ordinary experience. Though an electron
  does not behave like \na grain of sand in every respect, it has enough invariant
  pro- \nperties to be regarded as just as real. \n\nThe fact expressed by the uncertainty
  relation was first dis- \ncovered by interpreting the formalism of the theory. An
  \nexplanation appealing to intuition was given afterwards, namely \nthat the laws
  of nature themselves prohibit the measurement \nwith infinite accuracy because of
  the atomic structure of matter: \nthe most delicate instruments of observation are
  atoms or \nphotons or electrons, hence of the same order of magnitude as \nthe objects
  observed. Niels Bohr has applied this idea with great \nsuccess to illustrate the
  restrictions on simultaneous measure- \nments of quantities subject to an uncertainty
  rule, which he calls \n'complementary' quantities. \n\nOne can describe one and
  the same experimental situation \nabout particles either in terms of accurate positions
  or in terms \nof accurate momenta, but not both at the same time. The two \ndescriptions
  are complementary for a complete intuitive under- \nstanding. You find these things
  explained in many text-books \nso that I need not dwell upon them. \n\nThe adjective
  complementary is sometimes also applied to \nthe particle aspect and the wave aspect
  of phenomena I think \nquite wrongly. One can call these 'dual aspects' and speak
  of a \n'duality* of description, but there is nothing complementary as \nboth pictures
  are necessary for every real quantum phenomenon. \nOnly in limiting cases is an
  interpretation using particles alone \nor waves alone possible. The particle case
  is that of classical \nmechanics and is applicable only to the case of large masses,
  \ne.g. to the centre of mass of an almost closed system. The wave \ncase is that
  of very large numbers of independent particles, as \nillustrated by ordinary optics.
  \n\nThe question of whether the waves are something 'real' or a \nfiction to describe
  and predict phenomena in a convenient way \nis a matter of taste. I personally like
  to regard a probability \n\n\n\n106 \n\n\n\nCHANCE \n\n\n\nwave, even in S^-dimensional
  space, as a real thing, certainly \nas more than a tool for mathematical calculations.
  For it has \nthe character of an invariant of observation; that means it \npredicts
  the results of counting experiments, and we expect to \nfind the same average numbers,
  the same mean deviations, etc., \nif we actually perform the experiment many times
  under the \nsame experimental condition. Quite generally, how could we \nrely on
  probability predictions if by this notion we do not refer \nto something real and
  objective ? This consideration applies just \nas much to the classical distribution
  function f(t\\ p,q) as to the \nquantum-mechanical density matrix p(t; q,q'). \n\nThe
  difference between /and p lies only in the law of propaga- \ntion, a difference
  which can be described as analogous to that \nbetween geometrical optics and undulatory
  optics. In the latter \ncase there is the possibility of interference. The eigenfunctions
  \nof quantum mechanics can be superposed like light waves and \nproduce what is
  often called 'interference of probability'. \n\n\n\n/^rrrj\"__ _ \n\n\n\nB \nFIG.
  2. \n\nThis leads sometimes to puzzling situations if one tries to ex- \npress the
  observations only in terms of particles. Simple optical \nexperiments can be used
  as examples. Assume a source A of \nlight illuminating a screen B with two slits
  B l9 B% and the \nlight penetrating these observed on a parallel screen C. If only
  \none of the slits B is open, one sees a diffraction pattern around \nthe point
  where the straight line AB hits the screen, with a \nbright central maximum surrounded
  by small fringes. When \nboth slits are open and the central maxima of the diffraction
  \npattern overlap, there appear in this region new interference \nfringes, depending
  on the distance of the two slits. \n\n\n\nINDETERMINISTIC PHYSICS 107 \n\nThe intensity,
  i.e. the probability of finding photons on the \nscreen, in the case of both slits
  open, is therefore not a simple \nsuperposition of those obtained when only one
  of the slits is \nopen. This is at once understandable if you use the picture of
  \nprobability waves determining the appearance of photons. For \nthe spreading of
  the waves depends on the whole arrangement, \nand there is no miracle in the effect
  of shutting one slit. Yet if \nyou try to use the particles alone you get into trouble;
  for then a \nparticle must have passed one slit or the other and it is perfectly
  \nmysterious how a slit at a finite distance can have an influence on \nthe diffraction
  pattern. Reichenbach, who has published a very \nthorough book on the philosophical
  foundations of quantum \nmechanics, speaks in such cases of 'causal anomalies'.
  To avoid \nthe perplexity produced by them he distinguishes between \nphenomena,
  i.e. things really observable, such as the appearance \nof the photons on the screen,
  and 'inter-phenomena 3 , i.e. theoreti- \ncal constructions about what has happened
  to a photon on its \nway, whether it has passed through one slit or the other. He
  \nstates rightly that the difficulties arise only from discussing \ninter-phenomena.
  'That a photon has passed through the slit \nB t is meaningless as a statement of
  a physical fact.' If we want \nto make it a physical fact we have to change the
  arrangement \nin such a way that the passing of a photon through the slit B l can
  \nbe really registered; but then it would not fly on undisturbed, \nand the phenomenon
  on the screen would be changed. Reichen- \nbach's whole book is devoted to the discussion
  of this type of \ndifficulty. I agree with many of his discussions, though I object
  \nto others. For instance, he treats the interference phenomenon \nof two slits
  also in what he calls the wave interpretation; but here \nhe seems to me to have
  misunderstood the optical question. In \norder to formulate the permitted and forbidden
  (or meaningless) \nstatements he suggests the use of a three-valued logic, where
  the \nlaw of the 'excluded middle' (tertium non datur) does not hold. \nI have the
  feeling that this goes too far. The problem is not one \nof logic or logistic but
  of common sense. For the mathematical \ntheory, which is perfectly capable of accounting
  for the actual \nobservations, makes use only of ordinary two-valued logics. \n\n\n\n108
  CHANCE \n\nDifficulties arise solely if one transcends actual observations and \ninsists
  on using a special restricted range of intuitive images \nand corresponding terms.
  Most physicists prefer to adapt their \nimagination to the observations. Concerning
  the logical pro- \nblem itself, I had the impression when reading Reichenbach's
  \nbook that in explaining three- valued logic he constantly used \nordinary logic.
  This may be avoidable or justifiable. I remember \nthe days when I was in daily
  contact with Hilbert, who was \nworking on the logical foundations of mathematics.
  He dis- \ntinguished two stages of logics: intuitive logic dealing with finite \nsets
  of statements, and formal logic (logistics), which he described \nas a game with
  meaningless symbols invented to deal with the \ninfinite sets of mathematics avoiding
  contradictions (like that \nrevealed in Russell's paradox). But G6del showed that
  these \ncontradictions crop up again, and Hilbert's attempt is to-day \ngenerally
  considered a failure. I presume that three-valued \nlogic is another example of
  such a game with symbols. It is \ncertainly entertaining, but I doubt that natural
  philosophy will \ngain much by playing it. \n\nThinking in terms of quantum theory
  needs some effort and \nconsiderable practice. The clue is the point which I have
  \nstressed above, that quantum mechanics does not describe a \nsituation in an objective
  external world, but a definite experimen- \ntal arrangement for observing a section
  of the external world. \nWithout this idea even the formulation of a dynamical problem
  \nin quantum theory is impossible. But if it is accepted, the funda- \nmental indeterminacy
  in physical predictions becomes natural, \nas no experimental arrangement can ever
  be absolutely precise. \n\nI think that even the most fervent determinist cannot
  deny \nthat present quantum mechanics has served us well in actual \nresearch. Yet
  he may still hope that one day it will be replaced \nby a deterministic theory of
  the classical type. \n\nAllow me to discuss briefly what the chances of such a counter-
  \nrevolution are, and how I expect physics to develop in future. \n\nIt would be
  silly and arrogant to deny any possibility of a \nreturn to determinism. For no
  physical theory is final; new \nexperiences may force us to alterations and even
  reversions. Yet \n\n\n\nINDETERMINISTIC PHYSICS 109 \n\nscanning the history of
  physics in the way we have done we see \nfluctuations and vacillations, but hardly
  a reversion to more \nprimitive conceptions. I expect that our present theory will
  be \nprofoundly modified. For it is full of difficulties which I have not \nmentioned
  at all the self-energies of particles in interaction \nand many other quantities,
  like collision cross-sections, lead to \ndivergent integrals. But I should never
  expect that these \ndifficulties could be solved by a return to classical concepts.
  I \nexpect just the opposite, that we shall have to sacrifice some \ncurrent ideas
  and use still more abstract methods. However, \nthese are only opinions. A more
  concrete contribution to this \nquestion has been made by J. v. Neumann in his brilliant
  book, \nMathematische Orundlagen der Quantenmechanik. He puts the \ntheory on an
  axiomatic basis by deriving it from a few postulates \nof a very plausible and general
  character, about the properties \nof 'expectation values' (averages) and their representation
  by \nmathematical symbols. The result is that the formalism of \nquantum mechanics
  is uniquely determined by these axioms; in \nparticular, no concealed parameters
  can be introduced with the \nhelp of which the indeterministic description could
  be trans- \nformed into a deterministic one. Hence if a future theory \nshould be
  deterministic, it cannot be a modification of the present \none but must be essentially
  different. How this should be \npossible without sacrificing a whole treasure of
  well-established \nresults I leave to the determinists to worry about. \n\nI for
  my part do not believe in the possibility of such a turn \nof things. Though I am
  very much aware of the shortcomings \nof quantum mechanics, I think that its indeterministic
  founda- \ntions will be permanent, and this is what interests us from the \nstandpoint
  of these lectures on cause and chance. There remains \nnow only to show how the
  ordinary, apparently deterministic \nlaws of physics can be obtained from these
  foundations. \n\nQUANTUM KINETIC THEORY OF MATTER \nThe main problem of the classical
  kinetic theory of matter \nwas how to reconcile the reversibility of the mechanical
  motion \nof the ultimate particles with the irreversibility of the thenno- \n\n\n\n110
  CHANCE \n\ndynamical laws of matter in bulk. This was achieved by pro- \nclaiming
  a distinction between the true laws which are strictly \ndeterministic and reversible
  but of no use for us poor mortals \nwith our restricted means of observation and
  experimentation, \nand the apparent laws which are the result of our ignorance and
  \nobtained by a deliberate act of averaging, a kind of fraud or \nfalsification
  from the rigorous standpoint of determinism. \n\nQuantum theory can appear with
  a cleaner conscience. It \nhas no deterministic bias and is statistical throughout.
  It has \naccepted partial ignorance already on a lower level and need \nnot doctor
  the final laws. \n\nIn order to define a dynamical phenomenon one has, as we have
  \nseen, to split the system in two parts, one being the interesting \none, the other
  a 'perturbation'; and this separation is highly \narbitrary and adaptable to the
  experimental arrangement to be \ndescribed. Now this circumstance can be exploited
  for the pro- \nblem of thermodynamics. There one considers two (or more) \nbodies
  first separated and in equilibrium, then brought into \ncontact and left to themselves
  until equilibrium is again \nattained. \n\nLet HM be the Hamiltonian of the first
  body, #< 2 > that of the \nsecond, and write \n\n(9.31) \n\n\n\nThen this is the
  combined Hamiltonian of the separated bodies. \nIf they are brought into contact
  the Hamiltonian will be differ- \nent, namely ff = ^^ (9 32) \n\nwhere F is the
  interaction, which for ordinary matter in bulk will \nconsist of surface forces.
  Now (9.32) has exactly the form of the \nHamiltonian of the fundamental dynamical
  problem, if we are \n'interested* in J5T : and that is just the case. \n\nHence
  we describe the behaviour of the combined system by \nthe proper variables of the
  unperturbed system, i.e. by the inte- \ngrals of motion A\\ Aj^,..., of the first
  body, and the integrals \nof motion Ai 2) , Ajj 2) ,..., of the second body, which
  all together \nform the integrals of motion of the separated bodies, represented
  \n\n\n\nQUANTUM KINETIC THEORY OF MATTER 111 \n\nby H Q . Hence we can use the solution
  of the dynamical problem \ngiven before, namely (9.25), \n\n\n\nP(*,A) = P(A)+ I
  J(A, A'){P(A')-P(A)}+..., (9.33) \n\nA \n\nwhere now A represents the sets of eigenvalues
  A (1) = (A^, A^,...) \nof Ai, A^>,..., and X = (A< 2 >, Af>,...) of A< 2 >, A 2
  >,.... \nLet us consider first statistical equilibrium. Then \n\n\n\nhence the sum
  must vanish, and one must have \n\nP(A') = P(A) (9.34) \n\nfor any two states A,
  A' for which the transition probability \nJ(A,A') is not zero. But we have seen
  further that these quan- \ntities /(A,A') are in all practical cases proportional
  to the time \nand vanish unless the energy is conserved, E = E r (see formulae \n9.27,
  9.28). If we disregard cases where other constants of motion \nexist for which a
  conservation law holds (like angular momentum \nfor systems free to rotate), one
  can replace P(A) by P(E). But \nas the total system consists of two parts which
  are practically \nindependent, one has \n\nP(E) = P(A) = Pi(Aa>)P a (A>), (9.35)
  \n\nwhere the two factors represent the probabilities of finding the \nseparated
  parts initially in the states A (1) and A (2) . This factoriza- \ntion need not
  be taken from the axioms of the calculus of pro- \nbability; it is a consequence
  of quantum mechanics itself. For \nif the energy is a sum of the form (9.31), the
  exact solution of the \nfundamental equation for the density operator \n\n| = [#,/0
  (9.36) \n\nis p = p 1 pfr where p l refers to the first system H (l \\ /> 2 to the
  \nsecond # (2) ; as according to (9.24) P(t, A) = p(t\\ A, A), the product \nformula
  (9.35) holds not only for the stationary case (as long as \nthe interactions can
  be neglected). If now J (1 >(A (1) ) and J5 (2) (A (2) ) \nare the energies of the
  separated parts, one obtains from (9.35) \n\n(9.37) \n\n\n\n112 CHANCE \n\nwhich
  is a functional equation for the three functions P, P l9 P 2 . \nThe solution is
  easily found to be (see Appendix, 31) \n\np = e *-ps 9 p i = e *i-psi 9 p 2 = e
  **-ps* 9 (9.38) \n\nwith a = Oi+aj, J0 = .#!+ J 2 (9.39) \n\nand the same j8 in
  all three expressions. \n\nThus we have found again the canonical distribution of
  Gibbs, \nwith the modification that the energies appearing are not explicit \nfunctions
  of q and p (Hamiltonians) but of the eigenvalues \nA, A (1) , A (2) of the integrals
  of motion. \n\nThis derivation is obviously a direct descendant of Maxwell's \nfirst
  proof of his velocity distribution law which we discussed \npreviously, p. 51. But
  while the argument of independence is not \njustifiable with regard to the three
  components of velocity, it is \nperfectly legitimate for the constants of motion
  A. The fact \nthat the multiplication law of probabilities and the additivity \nof
  energies for independent systems leads to the exponential \ndistribution law has,
  of course, been noticed and used by many \nauthors, beginning with Gibbs himself.
  This reasoning becomes, \nwith the help of quantum mechanics, an exact proof which
  shows \nthe limits of validity of the results. For if there exist constants \nof
  motion other than the energy, the distribution law has to \nbe modified, and therefore
  the whole of thermodynamics. This \nhappens for instance for bodies moving freely
  in space, like stars, \nwhere the quantity /J = 1/kT is no longer a scalar but the
  time \ncomponent of a relativistic four- vector, the other components \nrepresenting
  j8v, where v is the mean velocity of the body. Yet \nthis is outside the scope of
  these lectures. \n\nThe simplest and much discussed application of quantum \nstatistics
  is that to the ideal gases. It was Einstein who first \nnoticed that for very low
  temperatures deviations from the \nclassical laws should appear. The Indian physicist,
  Bose, had \nshown that one can obtain Planck's law of radiation by regard- \ning
  the radiation as a 'photon gas* provided one did not treat \nthe photons as individual
  recognizable particles but as com- \npletely indistinguishable. Einstein transferred
  this idea to \nmaterial atoms. Later it was recognized that this so-called Bose-
  \n\n\n\nQUANTUM KINETIC THEORY OF MATTER 113 \n\nEinstein statistics was a straightforward
  consequence of quan- \ntum mechanics; about the same time Fermi and Dirac discovered
  \nanother similar case which applies to electrons and other particles \nwith spin.
  \n\nIn the language used here the two 'statistics' can be simply \ncharacterized
  by the symmetry of the density function \n\np(x 1 , X 2 ,..., x^; x lf X 2 ,...,
  Xjy). \n\nIt is always symmetric, for indistinguishable particles, in both \nsets
  of arguments, i.e. it remains unchanged if both sets are \nsubject to the same permutation.
  If, however, only one set is \npermuted, p remains also unchanged in the Bose-Einstein
  case \nfor all permutations, while in the Fermi-Dirac case it does so \nonly for
  even permutations, and changes sign for odd permuta- \ntions. \n\nApplied to a system
  of free particles of equal structure, one \nobtains at once from the canonical distribution
  law the pro- \nperties of so-called degenerate gases. But as these are treated in
  \nmany text-books, I shall not discuss them here (see Appendix, \n32). \n\nAfter
  having considered statistical equilibrium we have now \nto ask whether quantum mechanics
  accounts for the fact that \nevery system approaches equilibrium in time by the
  dissipation \nof visible energy into heat, or, in other words, whether the \nH-
  theorem of Boltzmann holds. \n\nThis is the case indeed, and not difficult to prove.
  One defines \nthe total entropy, just as in classical theory, by \n\n2P(t,A)logP(U)
  \n\n\n\nwhere the summations are to be extended over all values of the \nAi,A 2
  ,...; i.e. for each separate part of a coupled system over \nXL\\ A 2 X) ,... and
  AJ 2 *, A 2 2) ,..., respectively, and for the whole system \nover both sets. For
  loosely coupled systems the probabilities \nare, as we have seen, multiplicative
  at any time : \n\nP(t\\ A>, A< 2 >) = PM X)P 2 (t, A< 2 >). (9.41) \n\n\n\n5131
  \n\n\n\n114 CHANCE \n\nFrom this it follows easily that the entropies are additive,
  \n\nS = S^S^. (9.42) \n\nNow substitute into (9.40) the explicit expression for
  P(t,X) \nfrom (9.33) which holds for weak coupling; then by neglecting \nhigher
  powers of the small quantities J(A, A') one obtains \n\nJr(A,A')(A,A') \n\n\n\nwhere
  Q(X,X) - {P(A)-P(A')}log^. (9.44) \n\n-r(A ) \n\nThe transition probabilities J(A,
  A') are, as we have seen, in all \npractical cases proportional to time and vanish
  for transitions, \nfor which energy is not conserved; one has, according to (9.27)
  \nand (9.28), \n\nJ(A, A') = t |7(A, X')\\^(E-E'), (9.45) \n\n\n\nwhere V is the
  interaction potential. These quantities J(A, A') \n\nare always positive. So is
  the denominator ]T P(A), while Q(X, A') \n\nA \nis positive as long as P(A) differs
  from P(A'). \n\nHence S increases with time and will continue to do so, until \nstatistical
  equilibrium is reached. For only then no further \nincrease of 8 will happen, as
  is seen by taking equilibrium as the \ninitial state (where according to (9.34)
  Q(A,A') = for all non- \nvanishing transitions). \n\nIt remains now to investigate
  whether quantum kinetics \nleads, for matter in bulk, to the ordinary laws of motion
  and ther- \nmal conduction as formulated by Cauchy. This is indeed the \ncase, as
  far as these laws are expressed in terms of stress, energy, \nand flux of matter
  and heat. Yet, as we have seen, this is only \nhalf the story, since Cauchy's equations
  are rather void of mean- \ning as long as the dependence of these quantities on
  strain, \ntemperature, and the rate of their changes in space and time are \nnot
  given. Now in these latter relations the difference between \nquantum theory and
  classical theory appears and can reach vast \nproportions under favourable circumstances,
  chiefly for low \n\n\n\nQUANTUM KINETIC THEORY OF MATTER 115 \n\ntemperatures. The
  theory sketched in the following is mainly \ndue to my collaborator, Green. \n\nThe
  formal method of obtaining the hydrothermal equations \nis very similar to that
  used in classical theory. Starting from the \nfundamental equation for N particles
  \n\n8 -^ = [H N ,p N ], (9.46) \n\na reduction process is applied to obtain similar
  equations for \nNl,N2,..., particles, until the laws of motion for one particle
  \nare reached. \n\nThe reduction consists, as in classical theory, in averaging
  \nover one, say the last, particle of a set. The coordinates of each \nparticle
  appear twice as arguments of a matrix \n\n\n\nPn = \n\nPut here x (n) = x (w) '
  and integrate over x (n) ; the result is x n Pn> a \nmatrix which depends only on
  x (1) ,..., x (n ~ l) i x (l) ',.--> x^\" 1 *'. \nWith the same normalization as
  in classical theory, (6.40), p. 67, \n\n\\V6 \\Vilue \n\n\n\nBy applying this operation
  several times to (9.46) one obtains \n(see Appendix, 33) \n\n= [B q , P Q ]+S q
  (q = 1, 2,..., tf ), (9.48) \n\n\n\nwhere S q = ^ Xq+ i [<&* +1) , /> fl+ i], (9.49)
  \n\nin full analogy with the corresponding classical equations (6.44), \n(6.45).
  Here H Q means the Hamiltonian of q particles, O (i +1) \nthe interaction between
  one of these (i) and a further particle \n(q+1), and$ 9 is called, as before, the
  statistical term. \n\nThe quantity p fi (x, x) = ^(x) represents the generalized
  \nnumber density for a 'cluster* of q particles, and in particular \nn^x) is the
  ordinary number density. \n\nNow one can obtain generalized hydro-thermodynamical
  \nequations from (9.47) by a similar process to that employed in \n\n\n\n116 CHANCE
  \n\nclassical theory. Instead of integrating over the velocities one \nhas to take
  the diagonal terms of the matrices (putting x = x'), \nand one has to take some
  precautions in regard to non-commuta- \ntivity by symmetrizing products, e.g. replacing
  a/J by J(aj8+j8a) \n(see Appendix, 33). Exactly as in the classical equations of
  \nmotion there appears the average kinetic energy of the particle \n(i) in a cluster
  of q particles which, divided by |&, may be called \na kinetic temperature of the
  particle (i) in the cluster of q par- \nticles. One might expect that the quantity
  T : corresponds to the \nordinary temperature; but this is not the case. \n\nIt
  is well known from simple examples (e.g. the harmonic \noscillator) that in quantum
  theory for statistical equilibrium the \nthermodynamic temperature T 9 defined as
  the integrating de- \nnominator of entropy, is not equal to the mean square momen-
  \ntum. Here in the case of non -equilibrium it turns out that not \nonly this happens,
  but that a similar deviation occurs with regard \nto pressure. The thermodynamical
  pressure p is defined as the \nwork done by compression for unit change of volume;
  the kinetic \npressure p l is the isotropic part of the stress tensor in the equations
  \nof motion. These two quantities differ in quantum theory. \n\nObservable effects
  produced by this difference occur only for \nextremely low temperatures. For gases
  these are so low that \nthey cannot be reached at all because condensation takes
  place \nlong before. Most substances are solid crystals in this region of \ntemperature;
  for these one has a relatively simple quantum \ntheory, initiated by Einstein, where
  the vibrating lattice is \nregarded as equivalent to a set of oscillators (the 'normal
  modes'). \nThis theory represents the quantum effects in equilibrium \n(specific
  heat, thermal expansion) fairly well down to zero \ntemperature, while the phenomena
  of flow are practically \nunobservable. \n\nThere are only two cases where quantum
  phenomena of flow \nat very low temperatures are conspicuous. One is liquid helium
  \nwhich, owing to its small mass and weak cohesion, does not \ncrystallize under
  normal pressure even for the lowest tempera- \ntures and becomes supra-fluid at
  about 2 absolute. The other \ncase is that of the electrons in metals which, though
  not an \n\n\n\nQUANTUM KINETIC THEORY OF MATTER 117 \n\nordinary fluid, behave in
  many respects like one and, owing to \ntheir tiny mass, exhibit quantum properties,
  the strangest of \nwhich is supra-conductivity. \n\nIn order to confirm the principles
  of quantum statistics, \ninvestigations of these two cases are of great interest.
  Both \nhave been studied theoretically in my department in Edinburgh, \nand I wish
  to say a few words about our results. \n\nIn the supra-fluid state helium behaves
  very differently from a \nnormal liquid. It appears to lose its viscosity almost
  completely; \nit flows through capillaries or narrow slits with a fixed velocity
  \nalmost independent of the pressure, creeps along the walls of the \ncontainer,
  and so on. A metal in the supra-conductive state has, as \nthe name says, no measurable
  electrical resistance and behaves \nabnormally in other ways. A common and very
  conspicuous \nfeature of both phenomena is the sharpness of the transition \npoint
  which is accompanied by an anomaly of the specific \nheat: it rises steeply if the
  temperature approaches the critical \nvalue T c from below, and drops suddenly for
  T = T C9 so that the \ngraph looks like the Greek letter A; hence the expression
  A-point \nfor T c . However, this similarity cannot be very deeply rooted. \nWhere
  has one to expect, from the theoretical standpoint, the \nbeginning of quantum phenomena
  ? Evidently when the momen- \ntum p of the particles and some characteristic length
  I are reaching \nthe limit stated by the uncertainty principle, pi ~ H. If we \nequate
  the kinetic energy p 2 /2m to the thermal energy JcT, \nthe critical temperature
  will be given by lcT c ~ # 2 /2ml 2 . If one \nsubstitutes here for k and H the
  well-known numerical values and \nfor m the mass of a hydrogen atom times the atomic
  mass \nnumber /*, one finds, in degrees absolute, \n\noo \n\nT C~-Jt> ( 9 ' 5 )
  \n\nwhere I is measured in Angstr&m units (10\"\" 8 cm.). \n\nFor a helium atom
  one has //, = 4, and if lis the mean distance \nof two atoms (order 1 A) one obtains
  for T c a few degrees, which \nagrees with the observed transition at about 2. But
  for elec- \ntrons in metals one has \\L = 1/1840 . If one now assumes one \n\n\n\n118
  CHANCE \n\nelectron per atom and interprets I as their mean distance it would \nbe
  again of the order 1 A, hence the expression (9.50) would \nbecome some thousand
  degrees and has therefore nothing to do \nwith the A-point of supra-conductivity.
  This temperature has, \nin fact, another meaning; it is the so-called 'degeneration
  tem- \nperature' T g of the electronic fluid; below T g , for instance at \nordinary
  temperatures, there are already strong deviations from \nclassical behaviour (e.g.
  the extremely small contribution of the \nelectrons to the specific heat), though
  not of the extreme charac- \nter of supra-conductivity. In order to explain the
  A-point of \nsupra-conductivity which lies for all metals at a few degrees \nabsolute,
  one has to take I about 200 times larger (^ 200 A). \nAs the interpretation of this
  length is still controversial, I shall \nnot discuss supra-conductivity any further
  (see Appendix, 34). \n\nNor do I intend in the case of supra-fluidity of helium
  to give \na full explanation of the A-discontinuity, but I wish to direct \nyour
  attention to the thermo-mechanical properties of the \nsupra-liquid below the A-point,
  called He II. \n\nI have already mentioned that in quantum liquids one has to \ndistinguish
  the ordinary thermodynamic temperature T and \npressure p from the kinetic temperature
  T l and pressure p v \nThe hydro-thermal equations contain only T and p v and these
  \nquantities are constant in equilibrium, i.e. for a state where no \nchange in
  time takes place. But 2\\ and p l are not simple \nfunctions of T and p but depend
  also on the velocity and its \ngradient. Therefore in such a state permanent currents
  of mass \nand of energy may flow as if no viscosity existed. This is reflected in
  \nthe energy balance which can be derived from the hydro-thermal \nequations. One
  obtains a curious result which looks like a viola- \ntion of the first law of thermodynamics;
  for the change of heat \nis given by \n\ndQ = TdS = dU+pdV-Vdn, (9.51) \n\nwhere
  all symbols have the usual meaning, and TT = pp is \nthe difference of the kinetic
  and thermodynamic pressures. This \nequation differs from the ordinary thermodynamical
  expression \n(5.12) by the term V drr; howis this possible if thermodynamics \n\n\n\nQUANTUM
  KINETIC THEORY OF MATTER 119 \n\nclaims rightly universal validity? This claim is
  quite legitimate, \nbut the usual form of the expression for dQ depends on the \nassumption
  that a quasi-static, i.e. very slow, process can be \nregarded as a sequence of
  equilibria each determined by the \ninstantaneous values of pressure and volume.
  This is correct in \nthe classical domain, because if the rate of change of external
  \naction (compression, heat supply, etc.) is slowed down, all veloci- \nties in
  the fluid tend to disappear. Not so in quantum mechanics. \nIn consequence of the
  indeterminacy condition the momenta or \nthe velocities cannot decrease indefinitely
  if the coordinates of \nthe particles are restricted to very small regions. An investiga-
  \ntion of the hydro-thermal equations shows that this effect is \npreserved, to
  some degree, even for the visible velocities; it is \ntrue there can exist a genuine
  statistical equilibrium where the \ndensity is uniform and the currents of mass
  and energy vanish, \nbut there are also those states possible where certain combina-
  \ntions of currents of mass (velocities) and of energy (heat) per- \nmanently exist.
  The production of these depends entirely on \nthe way in which the heat dQ is supplied
  to the system and cannot \nbe suppressed by just making the rate of change of volume
  very \nsmall. We have therefore not a breakdown of the law of con- \nservation of
  energy but of its traditional thermodynamical \nformulation. \n\nThe consequences
  of that extra term in (9.51) are easily seen \nby introducing instead of the internal
  energy the quantity \n\nE = UTrV (9.52) \n\nin the expression (9.51) for dQ, which
  then reads \n\ndQ = dX+ptdV, (9.53) \n\nwhere p = P-\\~TT is the kinetic pressure.
  This shows that the \nspecific heat at constant volume is \n\n\n\n(9 54) \n\nP (9>54)
  \n\nnot (dU/dT)^ as in classical thermodynamics. Now as p v and \ntherefore TT =
  Pip, is very large at T = and decreases with \nincreasing T to reach the value at
  the A-point, one obtains for \n\n\n\n120 CHANCE \n\nc v (T) a curve exactly of the
  form actually observed. Hence the \nA-anomaly is due to the coupling of heat currents
  with the \nmass motion characteristic of quantum liquids. It is a molar, \nmacroscopic
  motion, the shape of which depends on the geo- \nmetrical conditions, presumably
  consisting of tiny closed threads \nof fast-moving liquid, or groups of density
  waves. \n\nA similar conception has been derived by several authors \n(Tisza, Mendelssohn,
  Landau) from the experiments; they speak \nof the liquid being a mixture of ordinary
  atoms and special \ndegenerate atoms (z-particles) which are in the lowest quantum
  \nstate and carry neither energy nor entropy. Yet in a liquid one \ncannot attribute
  a quantum state to single atoms. \n\nThese considerations are also the clue to the
  understanding \nof other anomalous phenomena, as the flow through narrow \ncapillaries
  or slits, the so-called fountain effect, the 'second \nsound', etc. Green has studied
  the properties of He II in detail \nand arrived at the conclusion that the quantum
  theory of liquids \ncan account for the strange behaviour of this substance. \n\nI
  have dwelt on this special problem in some detail as it reveals \nin a striking
  way that quantum phenomena are not confined to \natomic physics or microphysics
  where one aims at observing \nsingle particles, but appear also in molar physics
  which deals \nwith matter in bulk. From the fundamental standpoint this \ndistinction,
  so essential in classical physics, loses much of its \nmeaning in quantum theory.
  The ultimate laws are statistical, \nand the deterministic form of the molar equations
  holds for \ncertain averages which for large numbers of particles or quanta \nare
  all one wants to know. \n\nNow these molar laws satisfy all postulates of classical
  \ncausality: they are deterministic and conform to the principles \nof contiguity
  and antecedence. \n\nWith this statement the circle of our considerations about
  \ncause and chance in physics is closed. We have seen how classical \nphysics struggled
  in vain to reconcile growing quantitative \nobservations with preconceived ideas
  on causality, derived from \neveryday experience but raised to the level of metaphysical
  \npostulates, and how it fought a losing battle against the intrusion \n\n\n\nQUANTUM
  KINETIC THEORY OF MATTER 121 \n\nof chance. To-day the order of ideas has been reversed:
  chance \nhas become the primary notion, mechanics an expression of its \nquantitative
  laws, and the overwhelming evidence of causality \nwith all its attributes in the
  realm of ordinary experience is \nsatisfactorily explained by the statistical laws
  of large numbers. \n\n\n\nMETAPHYSICAL CONCLUSIONS \n\nTHE statistical interpretation
  which I have presented in the last \nsection is now generally accepted by physicists
  all over the world, \nwith a few exceptions, amongst them a most remarkable one.
  \nAs I have mentioned before, Einstein does not accept it, but still \nbelieves
  in and works on a return to a deterministic theory. To \nillustrate his opinion,
  let me quote passages from two letters. \nThe first is dated 7 November 1944, and

  \n\n(I cannot substantiate my attitude to physics in such a manner that \nyou would
  find it in any way rational. I see of course that the statistical \ninterpretation
  (the necessity of which in the frame of the existing for- \nmalism has been first
  clearly recognized by yourself) has a considerable \ncontent of truth. Yet I cannot
  seriously believe it because the theory \nis inconsistent with the principle that
  physics has to represent a reality \nin space and time without phantom actions over
  distances. ... I am \nabsolutely convinced that one will eventually arrive at a
  theory in which \nthe objects connected by laws are not probabilities, but conceived
  facts, \nas one took for granted only a short time ago. However, I cannot provide
  \nlogical arguments for my conviction, but can only call on my little finger \nas
  a witness, which cannot claim any authority to be respected outside \nmy own skin.)
  \n\nI have quoted these letters because I think that the opinion \nof the greatest
  living physicist, who has done more than anybody \nelse to establish modern ideas,
  must not be by-passed. Einstein \ndoes not share the opinion held by most of us
  that there is over- \nwhelming evidence for quantum mechanics. Yet he concedes \n'initial
  success' and 4 a considerable degree of truth'. He ob- \nviously agrees that we
  have at present nothing better, but he \nhopes that this will be achieved later,
  for he rejects the 'dice- \nplaying god'. I have discussed the chances of a return
  to deter- \nminism and found them slight. I have tried to show that classical \nphysics
  is involved in no less formidable conceptional difficulties \nand had eventually
  to incorporate chance in its system. We \nmortals have to play dice anyhow if we
  wish to deal with atomic \nsystems. Einstein's principle of the existence of an
  objective \nreal world is therefore rather academic. On the other hand, his \ncontention
  that quantum theory has given up this principle is \nnot justified, if the conception
  of reality is properly understood. \nOf this I shall say more presently. \n\nEinstein's
  letters teach us impressively the fact that even an \nexact science like physics
  is based on fundamental beliefs. The \nwords ich glaube appear repeatedly, and once
  they are under- \nlined. I shall not further discuss the difference between Ein-
  \nstein's principles and those which I have tried to extract from \nthe history
  of physics up to the present day. But I wish to \ncollect some of the fundamental
  assumptions which cannot be \nfurther reduced but have to be accepted by an act
  of faith. \n\n\n\n124 METAPHYSICAL CONCLUSIONS \n\nCausality is such a principle,
  if it is defined as the belief in the \nexistence of mutual physical dependence
  of observable situa- \ntions. However, all specifications of this dependence in
  regard \nto space and time (contiguity, antecedence) and to the infinite \nsharpness
  of observation (determinism) seem to me not funda- \nmental, but consequences of
  the actual empirical laws. \n\nAnother metaphysical principle is incorporated in
  the notion \nof probability. It is the belief that the predictions of statistical
  \ncalculations are more than an exercise of the brain, that they can \nbe trusted
  in the real world. This holds just as well for ordinary \nprobability as for the
  more refined mixture of probability and \nmechanics formulated by quantum theory.
  \n\nThe two metaphysical conceptions of causality and probability \nhave been our
  main theme. Others, concerning logic, arithmetic, \nspace, and time, are quite beyond
  the frame of these lectures. \nBut let me add a few more which have occasionally
  occurred, \nthough I am sure that my list will be quite incomplete. One is \nthe
  belief in harmony in nature, which is something distinct from \ncausality, as it
  can be circumscribed by words like beauty, \nelegance, simplicity applied to certain
  formulations of natural \nlaws. This belief has played a considerable part in the
  develop- \nment of theoretical physics remember Maxwell's equations of \nthe electromagnetic
  field, or Einstein's relativity but how far \nit is a real guide in the search of
  the unknown or just the expres- \nsion of our satisfaction to have discovered a
  significant relation, \nI do not venture to say. For I have on occasion made the
  sad \ndiscovery that a theory which seemed to me very lovely neverthe- \nless did
  not work. And in regard to simplicity, opinions will \ndiffer in many cases. Is
  Einstein's law of gravitation simpler \nthan Newton's? Trained mathematicians will
  answer Yes, \nmeaning the logical simplicity of the foundations, while others \nwill
  say emphatically No, because of the horrible complication \nof the formalism. However
  this may be, this kind of belief may \nhelp some specially gifted men in their research;
  for the validity \nof the result it has little importance (see Appendix, 35). \n\nThe
  last belief I wish to discuss may be called the principle of \nobjectivity. It provides
  a criterion to distinguish subjective \n\n\n\nMETAPHYSICAL CONCLUSIONS 126 \n\nimpressions
  from objective facts, namely by substituting for \ngiven sense-data others which
  can be checked by other indivi- \nduals. I have spoken about this method when I
  had to define \ntemperature: the subjective feeling of hot and cold is replaced
  \nby the reading of a thermometer, which can be done by any \nperson without a sensation
  of hot or cold. It is perhaps the most \nimportant rule of the code of natural science
  of which innumer- \nable examples can be given, and it is obviously closely related
  \nto the conception of scientific reality. For if reality is understood \nto mean
  the sum of observational invariants and I cannot see \nany other reasonable interpretation
  of this word in physics the \nelimination of sense qualities is a necessary step
  to discover \nthem. \n\nHere I must refer to the previous Waynflete Lectures given
  by \nProfessor E. D. Adrian, on The Physical Background of Percep- \ntion, because
  the results of physiological investigations seem to \nme in perfect agreement with
  my suggestion about the meaning \nof reality in physics. The messages which the
  brain receives have \nnot the least similarity with the stimuli. They consist in
  pulses \nof given intensities and frequencies, characteristic for the trans- \nmitting
  nerve-fibre, which ends at a definite place of the cortex. \nAll the brain 'learns'
  (I use here the objectionable language of \nthe 'disquieting figure of a little
  hobgoblin sitting up aloft in the \ncerebral hemisphere') is a distribution or 'map'
  of pulses. From \nthis information it produces the image of the world by a process
  \nwhich can metaphorically be called a consummate piece of com- \nbinatorial mathematics:
  it sorts out of the maze of indifferent \nand varying signals invariant shapes and
  relations which form \nthe world of ordinary experience. \n\nThis unconscious process
  breaks down for scientific ultra- \nexperience, obtained by magnifying instruments.
  But then it is \ncontinued in the full light of consciousness, by mathematical \nreasoning.
  The result is the reality offered by theoretical physics. \n\nThe principle of objectivity
  can, I think, be applied to every \nhuman experience, but is often quite out of
  place. For instance: \nwhat is a fugue by Bach ? Is it the invariant cross-section,
  or the \ncommon content of all printed or written copies, gramophone \n\n\n\n126
  METAPHYSICAL CONCLUSIONS \n\nrecords, sound waves at performances, etc., of this
  piece of music ? \nAs a lover of music I say No! that is not what I mean by a fugue.
  \nIt is something of another sphere where other notions apply, \nand the essence
  of it is not 'notions' at all, but the immediate \nimpact on my soul of its beauty
  and greatness. \n\nIn cases like this, the idea of scientific objective reality
  is \nobviously inadequate, almost absurd. \n\nThis is trivial, but I have to refer
  to it if I have to make good \nmy promise to discuss the bearing of modern physical
  thought \non philosophical problems, in particular on the problem of free \nwill.
  Since ancient times philosophers have been worried how \nfree will can be reconciled
  with causality, and after the tremen- \ndous success of Newton's deterministic theory
  of nature, this \nproblem seemed to be still more acute. Therefore, the advent of
  \nindeterministic quantum theory was welcomed as opening a \npossibility for the
  autonomy of the mind without a clash with \nthe laws of nature. Free will is primarily
  a subjective pheno- \nmenon, the interpretation of a sensation which we experience,
  \nsimilar to a sense impression. We can and do, of course, project \nit into the
  minds of our fellow beings just as we do in the case \nof music. We can also correlate
  it with other phenomena in order \nto transform it into an objective relation, as
  the moralists, \nsociologists, lawyers do but then it resembles the original \nsensation
  no more than an intensity curve in a spectral diagram \nresembles a colour which
  I see. After this transformation into \na sociological concept, free will is a symbolic
  expression to \ndescribe the fact that the actions and reactions of human beings
  \nare conditioned by their internal mental structure and depend on \ntheir whole
  and unaccountable history. Whether we believe \ntheoretically in strict determinism
  or not, we can make no use \nof this theory since a human being is too complicated,
  and we \nhave to be content with a working hypothesis like that of spon- \ntaneity
  of decision and responsibility of action. If you feel that \nthis clashes with determinism,
  you have now at your disposal \nthe modern indeterministic philosophy of nature,
  you can assume \na certain 'freedom', i.e. deviation from the deterministic laws,
  \nbecause these are only apparent and refer to averages. Yet if \n\n\n\nMETAPHYSICAL
  CONCLUSIONS 127 \n\nyou believe in perfect freedom you will get into difficulties
  again, \nbecause you cannot neglect the laws of statistics which are laws \nof nature.
  \n\nI think that the philosophical treatment of the problem of free \nwill suffers
  often (see Appendix, 36) from an insufficient dis- \ntinction between the subjective
  and objective aspect. It is \ndoubtless more difficult to keep these apart in the
  case of such \nsensations as free will, than in the case of colours, sounds, or
  \ntemperatures. But the application of scientific conceptions to a \nsubjective
  experience is an inadequate procedure in all such \ncases. \n\nYou may call this
  an evasion of the problem, by means of \ndividing all experience into two categories,
  instead of trying to \nform one all-embracing picture of the world. This division
  is \nindeed what I suggest and consider to be unavoidable. If quan- \ntum theory
  has any philosophical importance at all, it lies in the \nfact that it demonstrates
  for a single, sharply defined science the \nnecessity of dual aspects and complementary
  considerations. Niels \nBohr has discussed this question with respect to many applica-
  \ntions in physiology, psychology, and philosophy in general. \nAccording to the
  rule of indeterminacy, you cannot measure \nsimultaneously position and velocity
  of particles, but you have \nto make your choice. The situation is similar if you
  wish, for \ninstance, to determine the physico-chemical processes in the \nbrain
  connected with a mental process: it cannot be done because \nthe latter would be
  decidedly disturbed by the physical investiga- \ntion. Complete knowledge of the
  physical situation is only \nobtainable by a dissection which would mean the death
  of the \nliving organ or the whole creature, the destruction of the mental \nsituation.
  This example may suffice; you can find more and \nsubtler ones in Bohr's writings.
  They illustrate the limits of \nhuman understanding and direct the attention to
  the question \nof fixing the boundary line, as physics has done in a narrow \nfield
  by discovering the quantum constant ft. Much futile \ncontroversy could be avoided
  in this way. To show this by a \nfinal example, I wish to refer to these lectures
  themselves which \ndeal only with one aspect of science, the theoretical one. There
  \n\n\n\n128 METAPHYSICAL CONCLUSIONS \n\nis a powerful school of eminent scientists
  who consider such \nthings to be a futile and snobbish sport, and the people who
  \nspend their time on it drones. Science has undoubtedly two \naspects: it can be
  regarded from the social standpoint as a prac- \ntical collective endeavour for
  the improvement of human \nconditions, but it can also be regarded from the individualistic
  \nstandpoint, as a pursuit of mental desires, the hunger for know- \nledge and understanding,
  a sister of art, philosophy, and religion. \nBoth aspects are justified, necessary,
  and complementary. The \ncollective enterprise of practical science consists in
  the end of \nindividuals and cannot thrive without their devotion. But \ndevotion
  does not suffice; nothing great can be achieved without \nthe elementary curiosity
  of the philosopher. A proper balance is \nneeded. I have chosen the way which seemed
  to me to harmonize \nbest with the spirit of this ancient place of learning. \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX
  \n\n1. (II. p. 8.) Multiple causes \n\nAny event may have several causes. This possibility
  is not \nexcluded by my definition (given explicitly on p. 9), though I \nspeak
  there of A being 'the' cause of the effect B. Actually the \n'number* of causes,
  i.e. of conditions on which an effect B \ndepends, seems to me a rather meaningless
  notion. One often \nfinds the idea of a 'causal chain' A^A^,..., where B depends
  \ndirectly on A V A^ on A 2 , etc., so that B depends indirectly on \nany of the
  A n . As the series may never end where is a 'first \ncause' to be found ? the number
  of causes may be, and will be \nin general, infinite. But there seems to be not
  the slightest \nreason to assume only one such chain, or even a number of \nchains;
  for the causes may be interlocked in a complicated way, \nand a 'network' of causes
  (even in a multi-dimensional space) \nseems to be a more appropriate picture. Yet
  why should it be \nenumerable at all? The 'set of all causes' of an event seems
  to \nme a notion just as dangerous as the notions which lead to logical \nparadoxes
  of the type discovered by Russell. It is a metaphysical \nidea which has produced
  much futile controversy. Therefore I \nhave tried to formulate my definition in
  such a way that this \nquestion can be completely avoided. \n\n2. (III. p. 13.)
  Derivation of Newton's law from Kepler's \nlaws \n\nThe fact that Newton's law is
  a logical consequence of Kepler's \nlaws is the basis on which my whole conception
  of causality in \nphysics rests. For it is, apart from Galileo's simple demonstra-
  \ntion the first and foremost example of a timeless cause-effect \nrelation derived
  from observations. In most text-books of \nmechanics the opposite way (deduction
  of Kepler's laws from \nNewton's) is followed. Therefore it may be useful to give
  the \nfull proof in modern terms. \n\nWe begin with formulating Kepler's laws, splitting
  the first \none in two parts: \n\nla. The orbit of a planet is a plane curve. \n\n16.
  It has the shape of an ellipse, one focus of which is the sun. \n\n\n\n130 APPENDIX
  \n\nII. The area A swept by the radius vector increases propor- \n\ntionally to
  time. \n\nIII. The ratio of the cube of the semi-axis a of the ellipse to \nthe
  square of the period T is the same for all planets. \n\nFrom I a it follows that
  it suffices to consider a plane, intro- \nducing rectangular coordinates x,y, polar
  coordinates r, ^, so \n\nx = rcos</> ) y = rsin<. \n\nIndicating differentiation
  with respect to time by a dot, one \nobtains for the velocity \n\n\n\nrsn, y = \nand
  for the acceleration \n\nx = a r cos</> cfysin<, y \nwhere a r = r r<j> 2 , (I)
  \n\n0,4 = 2ty+r (2) \n\nare the radial and tangential components of the acceleration.
  \n\nNext we use II. The element of the area in polar coordinates \nis obviously
  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIG. 3. \n\nIf the origin is taken at the centre of the sun, the rate
  of in- \ncrease of A is constant, say $h, dA = %hdt, or \n\n2A = rty = A - (3) \n\nNow
  it is convenient to use the variable \n\nu = \nr \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX 131 \n\ninstead
  of r and to describe the orbit by expressing u as a function \nof<j> y u((f>). Then

  \n\nSubstituting (4), (5), (6) into (2), one finds \n\nHence the acceleration has
  only a radial component a r with \nrespect to the sun. To obtain the value of a
  r we calculate, with \nthe help of (4), \n\n. __ dr - __ h dr __ __, du \n\n\" =
  A \nand substitute this in (1): \n\n\n\nwe use 16. The polar equation of an ellipse
  is \n\n\n\nwhere q is the semi-latus rectum and e the numerical eccentricity; \nor
  u = -(l+cos^). \n\nFrom this, one obtains \n\ndu . . d*u e . \n\n= -- sm<i, -r-
  9 = cos^, \nd<f> q Y d<t>* q Y \n\nhence from (8) a r = -- u 2 == --- ^. (10) \n\nThe
  acceleration is directed to the sun (centripetal) and is \ninversely proportional
  to the square of the distance. \n\n\n\n132 APPENDIX \n\nAccording to the third law
  III one can write \n\n* til) \n\nI 11 * \n\n\n\nwhere the constant /z is the same
  for all planets. \nNow integrating (3) for a full revolution one has \n\n2A = hT.
  (12) \n\nOn the other hand, the area of an ellipse is given by \n\nA = nab, (13)
  \n\nwhere a and b are the major and minor semi-axes. \n\nTaking in (9) <j4 = and
  <f> = TT one gets the aphelion and \nperihelion distances; half of the sum of those
  is the semi-major \n\naxis: \n\n\n\nwhile the semi-minor axis is given by \n\n\n\nhence
  aq = 6 2 . \n\nSubstituting this in (13), one gets from (12) \n\n\n\nsolving with
  respect to h 2 /q and using (11): \nA 2 \n\n\n\nTherefore the law of acceleration
  (10) becomes \n\na, = _, (15) \n\nwhere p is the same for all planets, hence a property
  of the sun, \ncalled the gravitational mass. \n\nThis demonstrates the statement
  of the text that Newton's \nderivation of his law of force is purely deductive,
  based on the \ninductive work of Ty cho Brahe and Kepler. The new feature due \nto
  Newton is the theoretical interpretation of the deduced formula \nfor the acceleration,
  as representing the *cause' of the motion, \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX 133 \n\nor the force
  determining the motion, which then led him to the \nfundamental idea of general
  gravitation (each body attracts each \nother one). In the text-books this situation
  is not always clear; \nthis may be due to Newton's own representation in his Principia
  \nwhere he uses only geometrical constructions in the classical \nstyle of the Greeks.
  Yet it is known that he possessed the \nmethods of infinitesimal calculus (theory
  of fluxions) for many \nyears. I do not know whether he actually discovered his
  results \nwith the help of the calculus; it seems to me incredible that he \nshould
  not. He was obviously keen to avoid new mathematical \nmethods in order to comply
  with the taste of his contemporaries. \nBut it is known also that he liked to conceal
  his real ideas by \ndressing them up. This tendency is found in Gauss and other
  \ngreat mathematicians as well and has survived to our time, \nmuch to the disadvantage
  of science. \n\nNewton regarded the calculation of terrestrial gravity from \nastronomical
  data as the crucial test of his theory, and he with- \nheld publication for years
  as the available data about the radius \nof the earth were not satisfactory. The
  formula (3.3) of the text \nis simply obtained by regarding the earth as central
  body and \nthe moon as 'planet'. Then //, is the gravitational mass of the \nearth
  which can be obtained from (11) by inserting for a the \nmean distance B of the
  centre of the moon from that of the earth, \nand for T the length of the month.
  Substituting ^ = 47r 2 JB 8 /T 2 \ninto (15), where r is the radius of the earth,
  one obtains for the \nacceleration on the earth's surface g ( = a r ) the formula
  (3.3) \nof the text, \n\n\n\nIf here the values Rjr = 60, jR = 3-84x!0 10 cm., and
  \nT = 27 d 7 h 43 m 11 -5 s = 2-361X10 6 sec. are substituted, one \nfinds g = 980
  *2 cm. sec.~ 2 , while the observed value (extrapolated \nto the pole) is g = 980
  '6 cm. sec.~ 2 \n\nThis reasoning is based on the plausible assumption that the
  \nacceleration produced by a material sphere at a point outside is \nindependent
  of the radial distribution of density and the mass of \nthe sphere can therefore
  be regarded as concentrated in the \ncentre. The rigorous proof of this lemma forms
  an important \npart of Newton's considerations and was presumably achieved \nwith
  the help of his theory of fluxions. \n\n\n\n134 APPENDIX \n\n3. (IV. p. 20.) Cauchy's

  substances is \nthe following theorem of Gauss (also attributed to Green). \n\nIf
  a vector field A is defined inside and on the surface S of a \nvolume F, one has

  which vanishes for any surface; hence its integrand \nmust be zero: p+divu = 0.
  (4) \n\nThis is the continuity equation (4.5) of the text. \n\nConsider now the
  forces acting on the volume F. Neglecting \nthose forces which act on each volume
  element (like Newton's \ngravitation), we assume with Cauchy that there are surface
  \nforces or tensions, acting on each element dS of the surface S, \nand proportional
  to dS. They will also depend on the orientation \nof dS, i.e. on the normal vector
  n, and can therefore be written \nT n dS. If n coincides with one of the three axes
  of coordinates \nx,y,z, the corresponding forces per unit area may be repre- \nsented
  by the vectors T^, T y) T e . Now the projections of an \nelement dS on the coordinate
  planes are \n\ndS x = n x dS, dS y = n y dS, dS z = n z dS. \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX 135

  form \n\n(T n ) x = T xx n x +T yx n v +T zx n s = T x .n, \n\nwhere T x is the

  equations of the electromagnetic \nfield \n\nThe mathematical part of Maxwell's
  work consisted in con- \ndensing the experimental laws, mentioned in the text, in
  a set \nof differential equations which, with the usual notation, are \n\ndiv D
  = 4?rp, curl H == u, \n\nc \n\ndivB = 0, curlE+~B = 0, (1) \n\nc \n\nD = E, B =
  pH. \n\nTo give a simple example, Coulomb's law for the electrostatic \nfield is
  obtained by putting B = 0, H = 0, u = 0; then there \n\nremains ,. ~ A 1T ^ \n\ndivD

  such that \n\n\n\n- \n\nax' \n\nIn vacuOy where D = E, one obtains therefore Poisson's
  \n\nequation ,. . . \n\n^ divE = A( = \n\n\n\nThe solution is <f> = f ^dV, (2) \n\nprovided
  singularities are excluded; this formula expresses \nCoulomb's law for a continuous
  distribution of density. In a \nsimilar way one obtains for stationary states (B
  = 0) the law of \nBiot and Savart for the magnetic field of a current of density
  u. \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX 139 \n\nMaxwell's physical idea consisted in discovering the
  asym- \nmetry in the equations (1) which, in our style of writing, is \n\nobvious
  even to the untrained eye: the missing term -6 in the \n\nc \n\nsecond equation.
  The logical necessity of this term follows from \nthe fact of the existence of open
  currents, e.g. discharges of con- \ndensers through wires. In this case the charge
  on the condenser \nchanges in time, hence p ^ 0; on the other hand, the equations
  \n\n^ \n(1) imply divu = divcurlH = 0. Therefore the continuity \n\nequation />+divu
  = is violated. \n\nTo amend this Maxwell postulated a new type of current \nbridging
  the gap between the conductors in the condenser, with \na certain density w, so
  that \n\ncurlH = (u+ w). (3) \n\nc \n\nThen taking the div operation one has \n\ndiv
  w div u = p = divD. \n\n47T \n\nThe simplest way of satisfying this equation is
  putting \n\nW = ^D, (4) \n\nso that the corresponding equation in Maxwell's set
  becomes \n\n~iD = u (5) \n\nc c v ' \n\nand complete symmetry between electric and
  magnetic quanti- \nties is obtained (apart from the fact that the latter have no
  true \ncharge and current). \n\nThe modified system of field equations permits the
  prediction \nof waves with finite velocity. In an isotropic substance free of \ncharges
  and currents (p = 0, u = 0, D = eE, B = /^H) one has \n\ncurlH--E = 0, curlE+^H
  = 0; \nc c \n\ntaking the curl of one of them, and using the formula that for a
  \n\n\n\n140 APPENDIX \n\n\n\nvector with vanishing div one has curl curl = A, one
  obtains \nfor each component of E and H the wave equation \n\n\n\nFor vacuum (c
  = /x = 1) the velocity of propagation should \ntherefore be equal to the electromagnetic
  constant c. As stated \nin the text, this constant has the dimensions of a velocity
  and can \nbe measured by determining the magnetic field of a current \nproduced
  by a condenser discharge (measured therefore electro- \nstatically). Such experiments
  had been performed by Kohl- \nrausch and Weber, and their result for c agreed with
  the velocity \nof light in vacuo. This evidence for the electromagnetic theory of
  \nlight was strongly enhanced by experiments carried out by \nBoltzmann, which showed
  that the velocity of light in simple \nsubstances (rare gases, which are monatomic)
  can be calculated \nfrom their dielectric constant e (p being practically = 1 )
  with the \nhelp of Maxwell's formula c x = c/Ve. \n\nMaxwell's formulation satisfies
  contiguity, but its relation to \nCauchy's form of the dynamical laws has still
  to be established. \nThe electric and magnetic field vectors, though originally
  defined \nby the forces on point charges and magnetic poles (which actually \ndo
  not exist), are defined by the equations also in places where \nneither charges
  nor currents exist. Yet they are not stresses \nthemselves; they are analogous to
  strains, on which the stresses \ndepend. The law of this connexion has also been
  found by Max- \nwell; it is a mathematical formulation of Faraday's intuitive \ninterpretation
  of the mechanical reactions between electrified \nand magnetized bodies. A short
  indication must here suffice. \n\nApart from the electric force on a point charge
  e, F = eE, \nthere exists a mechanical force on the element of a linear current
  \nu, produced by a magnetic field H; this force is perpendicular \nto H and to the
  current u and therefore does no work. It is not \nquite uniquely determined, as
  one can obviously add any force \nwhose line integral over a closed circuit vanishes.
  The simplest \nexpression is: \n\n\n\nas can be seen by considering the change of
  magnetic energy \n|TT J H . B dV produced by a virtual displacement of an element
  \nof the current. \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX 141 \n\nTo illustrate Maxwell's procedure it
  suffices to consider charge \ndistributions in vacuo with density p and current
  u = />v. \n\nCombining the two forces F = eE and F = - u A B into one \n\nc \n\nexpression,
  one has for the density of force \n\n(7) \n\n\n\nthe so-called Lorentz force. \n\nSubstituting
  here for p and pv the expressions from Maxwell's \nequations one can, by elementary
  transformations, bring f into \nthe form of Cauchy , . __ , . - \n\nwhere \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese
  are the celebrated formulae of Maxwell's tensions. They \ncan be easily generalized
  for material bodies with dielectric \nconstant and permeability, and they have become
  the prototype \nfor similar expressions in other field theories, e.g. gravitation
  \n(Einstein), electronic field (Dirac), meson field (Yukawa). \n\n5. (IV. p. 27.)
  Relativity \n\nIt is impossible to give a short sketch of the theory of relativity,
  \nand the reader is referred to the text-books. The best representa- \ntion seems
  to me still the article in vol. v of the Mathematical \nEncyclopaedia written by
  W. Pauli when he was a student, \nabout twenty years of age. There one finds a clear
  statement of \nthe experimental facts which led to the mathematical theory \nalmost
  unambiguously. Eddington's treatment gives the im- \npression that the results could
  have been obtained or even \nhave been obtained by pure reason, using epistemological
  \nprinciples. I need not say that this is wrong and misleading. \nThere was, of
  course, a philosophical urge behind Einstein's \nrelentless effort; in particular
  the violation of contiguity in \nNewton's theory seemed to him unacceptable. Yet
  the greatness \nof his achievement was just that he based his own theory not on
  \npreconceived notions but on hard facts, facts which were obvious \n\n\n\n142 APPENDIX
  \n\nto everybody, but noticed by nobody. The main fact was the \nidentity of inertial
  and gravitational mass, which he expressed \nas the principle of equivalence between
  acceleration and gravita- \ntion. An observer in a closed box cannot decide by any
  experi- \nment whether an observed acceleration of a body in the box is \ndue to
  gravity produced by external bodies or to an acceleration \nof the box in the opposite
  direction. This principle means that \narbitrary, non-linear transformations of
  time must be admitted. \nBut the formal symmetry between space-coordinates and time
  \ndiscovered by Minkowski made it very improbable that the \ntransformations of
  space should be linear, and this was corro- \nborated by considering rotating bodies:
  a volume element on the \nperiphery should undergo a peripheral contraction according
  \nto the results of special relativity, but remain unchanged in the \nradial direction.
  Hence acceleration was necessarily connected \nwith deformation. This led to the
  postulate that all laws of \nnature ought to be unchanged (covariant) with respect
  to \narbitrary space-time transformations. But as special relativity \nmust be preserved
  in small domains, the postulate of in variance \nof the line element had to be made.
  \n\nThe long struggle of Einstein to find the general covariant field \nequations
  was due to the difficulty for a physicist to assimilate \nthe mathematical ideas
  necessary, ideas which were in fact \ncompletely worked out by Riemann and his successors,
  Levi- \nCivita, Ricci, and others. \n\nI wish to add here only one remark. The physical
  significance \nof the line element seems to me rather mystical in a genuinely \ncontinuous
  space-time. If it is replaced by the assumption of \nparallel displacement (affine
  connexion), this impression of \nmystery is still further enhanced. On the other
  hand, the \nappearance of a> finite length in the ultimate equations of physics
  \ncan be expected. Quantum theory is the first step in this direc- \ntion; it introduces
  not a universal length but a constant, Planck's \nK y of the dimension length times
  momentum into the laws of \nphysics. There are numerous indications that the further
  \ndevelopment of physics will lead to a separate appearance of \nthese two factors,
  h = q. p, in the ultimate laws. The difficulties \nof present-day physics are centred
  about the problem of intro- \nducing this length q in a way which satisfies the
  principle of \nrelativity. This fact seems to indicate that relativity itself \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX
  143 \n\nneeds a generalization where the infinitesimal element ds is \nreplaced
  by a finite length. \n\nThe papers quoted in the text are: A. Einstein, L. Infeld,
  and \nB. Hoffmann, Ann. of Math., 39, no. 1, p. 65 (Princeton, \n1938); V. A. Fock,
  Journ. of Phys. U.S.S.R. 1, no. 2, p. 81 (1939). \n\n6. (V. p. 38.) On classical
  and modern thermodynamics \n\nIt is often said that the classical derivation of
  the second law \nof thermodynamics is much simpler than Carath6odory's as it \nneeds
  less abstract conceptions than Pfaffian equations. But \nthis objection is quite
  wrong. For what one has to show is the \nexistence of an integrating denominator
  of dQ. This is trivial \nfor a Pfaffian of two variables (representing, for example,
  a single \nfluid with F, #) ; it must be shown not to be trivial and even, in \ngeneral,
  wrong for Pfaffians with more than two variables (e.g. two \nfluids in thermal contact
  with Tj, !,#). Otherwise, the student \ncannot possibly understand what the fuss
  is all about. But that \nmeans explaining to him the difference between the two
  classes \nof Pfaffians of three variables, the integrable ones and the non- \nintegrable
  ones. Without that all talk about Carnot cycles is just \nempty verbiage. But as
  soon as one has this difference, why not \nthen use the simple criterion of accessibility
  from neighbouring \npoints, instead of invoking quite new ideas borrowed from \nengineering
  ? I think a satisfactory lecture or text-book should \nbring this classical reasoning
  as a corollary of historical interest, \nas I have suggested long ago in a series
  of papers (Phys. Zeitschr. \n22, pp. 218, 249, 282 (1921)). \n\nSince writing the
  text I have come across one book which \ngives a short account of Carath^odory's
  theory, H. Margenau \nand G. M. Murphy, The Mathematics of Physics and Chemistry
  \n(D. van Nostrand Co., New York, 1943), 1.15, p. 26. But \nthough the mathematics
  is correct, it does not do justice to the \nidea. For it says on p. 28: 'This formal
  mathematical con- \nsequence of the properties of the Pfaff equation [namely the
  \ntheorem proved in the next section of the appendix] is known as \nthe principle
  of Carath^odory. It is exactly what we need for \nthermodynamics.' Carath6odory's
  principle is, of course, not \nthat formal mathematical theorem but the induction
  from obser- \nvation that there are inaccessible states in any neighbourhood \nof
  a given state. \n\n\n\n144 APPENDIX \n\n7. (V. p. 39.) Theorem of accessibility
  \n\nAn example of a Pfaffian which has no integrating denomina- \ntor (by the way,
  the same example as described in geometrical \nterms in the text) is this: \n\ndQ
  = y dx-\\-x dy+k dz, \n\nwhere Tc is a constant. If it were possible to write dQ
  in the \nform Ad^, where A and < are functions of x, y, z, one would have \n\nd<f>

  like this show clearly that the existence of an \nintegrating denominator is an
  exception. \n\nWe now give the proof of the theorem of accessibility. \nConsider
  the solutions of the Pfaffian \n\ndQ = X dx+Y dy+Z dz = 0, (1) \n\nwhich lie in
  a given surface 8, \n\nx = x(u, v) y y = y(u, v), z = z(u, v). \nThey satisfy a

  of apointP, there \nare inaccessible points; let Q be one of these. Construct through
  \n\n\n\n\n\nFIG. 6. \n\n\n\nFIG. 7. \n\n\n\nP a straight line J2 7 , which is not
  a solution of (1 ), and the plane ir \nthrough Q and JSf. In TT there is just one
  curve satisfying (1) and \ngoing through Q\\ this curve will meet the line & at
  a point R. \nThen R must be inaccessible from P; for if there should exist a \nsolution
  leading from P to JB, then one could also reach Q from \nP by a continuous (though
  kinked) solution curve, which \ncontradicts the assumption that Q is inaccessible
  from P. The \npoint R can be made to lie as near to P as one wishes by choosing
  \nQ near enough to P. \n\nNow we move the straight line JS? parallel to itself in
  a cyclic \nway so that it describes a closed cylinder. Then there exists on \nthis
  cylinder a solution curve # which starts from P on .5? and \nmeets JS? again at
  a point N. It follows that N and P must coin- \ncide. For otherwise one could, by
  deforming the cylinder, make \nN sweep along the line JS? towards P and beyond P.
  Hence there \nwould be an interval of accessible points (like N) around P, \n\n5131
  T . \n\n\n\n146 APPENDIX \n\nwhile it has been proved before that there are inaccessible
  points \nQ in any neighbourhood of P. \n\nAs N now coincides with P the connecting
  curve ^ can be \nmade, by steady deformation of the cylinder, to describe a \nsurface
  which contains obviously all solutions starting from P. \nIf this surface is given
  by <f>(x, y, z) = 0, one has \n\ndQ = A <ty, \n\nwhich is the theorem to be proved.

  of chemical equilibria \n\nCarath6odory's original publication on his foundation
  of \nthermodynamics (Math. Ann. 61, p. 355, 1909) is written in a \nvery abstract
  way. He considers a type of systems which are \ncalled simple and defined by the
  property that of the parameters \nnecessary to fix a state of equilibrium all except
  one are con- \nfigurational variables, i.e. such that their values can be arbi-
  \ntrarily prescribed (like volumes). In my own presentation of the \ntheory, of
  1 92 1 (quoted in Appendix, 6), there is only a hint at the \nend ( 9) how such
  variables can be introduced in more complica- \nted cases, as for instance for chemical
  equilibria where the concen- \ntrations of the constituents can be changed. I hoped
  at that time \nthat this might be worked out by the chemists themselves, for it
  \nneeds nothing more than the usual method of semi-permeable \nwalls with a slight
  modification of the wording. As this has not \nhappened, I shall give here a short
  indication how to do it. \n\nI consider first a simple fluid (without decomposition),
  but \narrange it in such a way that volume V and mass M are both \nindependently
  changeable. For this purpose one has to imagine \na cylinder with a piston attached
  to the volume V, connected \nby a valve, through which substance can be pressed
  into the \nvolume V considered. The position of the auxiliary piston \ndetermines
  uniquely the mass M contained in V\\ hence M can \nbe regarded as a configuration
  variable in Carath^odory's sense. \nIf the valve is closed, V can be changed, by
  moving the 'main' \npiston, without altering M . Hence M and V are both indepen-
  \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX \n\n\n\n147 \n\n\n\ndent configuration variables, and the work
  done for any change \nof them must be regarded as measurable. If this work is deter-
  \nmined adiabatically one obtains the energy function, say in \nterms of F, M and
  the empirical temperature #, U(V 9 M,&). \n\n\n\n\nFIG. 8. \n\nWhen this is known
  the differential of heat is defined by the \ndifference JQ __ ^jjj^^dV dM (1} \n\nwhere
  p and p arc functions of the state (V,M,&) like U, which \ncan be regarded as empirically
  known. \n\nNow one has in (1) a Pfaffian of three variables and can apply \nthe
  same considerations as before which lead to the result that dQ \nis integrable and
  can be equated to T dS. Hence one can write \n\ndU = TdS-pdV+pdM. (2) \n\nBut U
  must be a homogeneous function of the first order in the \nvariables S, V, M. If
  one introduces the specific variables \n\nU*S*V DV TT -r n -JT TT ir /\\\\ \n\n,

  du = Tdspdv. (6) \n\nIf the substance inside F is a chemical compound and one wishes
  \nto investigate its decomposition into n components, one assumes \nn cylinders
  with pistons attached to F, separated from F by \nsemi-permeable walls, each of
  which allows the passage of only \none of the components. Then one has in the same
  way \n\n\n\ndU = TdS-pdV+ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7) \n\n\n\n148 APPENDIX \n\nwhere F, M
  v M z ,..., M n can be regarded as configuration variables \nand U, p, fa, p z ,...

  of thermodynamics consists in deriving rela- \ntions between the variables by differentiating
  the equations \n(11), e.g. BT e d \n\n== . _ci = etc. \ndv ds dv dcS \n\nAs experiments
  are often performed at constant pressure or \ntemperature or both, one uses instead
  of u(s 9 v 9 c l9 ... 9 c n ) 9 the \nfunctions free energy uTa = /, enthalpy u+pv
  = w, or free \nenthalpy p = u+pvTs (defined by (4)). For the latter, for \nexample,
  it follows from (12) that \n\ndp = sdT+vdp-}- J Pidc i9 (13) \n\n\n\n, \n= --> v

  (15) \n\nThe most important theorem, which follows from these general \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX
  149 \n\nequations, is Gibbs's phase rule. The system may exist in differ- \nent
  phases if the n equations \n\n^(T,p,c^c n ) = C< (t = 1,..., n) (16) \n\nhave several
  solutions. Let ra be the number of independent \nsolutions; then there are m phases
  which can be ordered in such a \nway that each has contact with two others only.
  Hence there \nare ml interfaces and n equations of the form (16) for each, \naltogether
  n(mI) independent equations. On the other hand, \nthere are (nl) independent concentrations
  c^...,c n ^ for each \nphase, i.e. m(n I) for the whole system, to which the two
  vari- \nables p, T have to be added; hence m(n l)+2 independent \nvariables. The
  number of arbitrary parameters, or the number of \ndegrees of freedom of the system,
  is therefore \n\nm(n 1)+2 -n(m 1) = n m+2. \n\nSo for a single pure substance, n
  = 1, the number of degrees of \nfreedom is 3 m; hence there are three cases m =
  1, 2, 3 corre- \nsponding to one phase, two or three coexisting phases; more than
  \nthree phases cannot be in equilibrium. All further progress in \nthermodynamics
  is based on special assumptions about the func- \ntions involved, either prompted
  by experiment, or chosen by an \nargument of simplicity, or and this is the most
  important \nstep derived from statistical considerations. \n\n9. (V. p. 44.) Velocity
  of sound in gases \n\nThe simple problem of calculating the adiabatic law for an

  two properties: (1) Boyle's law, \nthe isotherms are given by pV = const.; (2) the
  same quantity \npV remains constant if the gas expands without doing work. In \nmathematical

  S = S Q +Rlog(0V). \n\nIf the special assumption is made, that U depends linearly
  on \npV (which holds for dilute gases with the same approximation \nas Boyle's law),
  one has U = c v T and, from (2), \n\n\n\nThe entropy becomes therefore \n\nS=S Q

  this section of the text a new development of \nthe descriptive or phenomenological
  theory has come to my \nknowledge which is remarkable enough to be mentioned. \n\nIt
  started in 1931 with a paper by Onsager in which the \nattempt was made to build
  up a thermodynamics of irreversible \nprocesses by taking from the kinetic theory
  one single result, \ncalled the theorem of microscopic reversibility, and to show
  that \nthis suffices to obtain some important properties of the flow of \nheat,
  matter, and electricity. The starting-point is Einstein's \ntheory of fluctuations
  (see Appendix, 20), where the relation \n8 = klogP between probability P and entropy
  8 is reversed, \nusing the known dependence of S on observable quantities to \ndetermine
  the probability P of small deviations from equili- \nbrium. Then it is assumed that
  the law for the decay of an \naccidental accumulation of some quantity (mass, energy,
  tem- \nperature, etc.) is the same as that for the flow of the same \nquantity under

  Elementary kinetic theory of gases \n\nTo derive equation (6.1) of the text, consider
  the molecules \nof a gas to be elastic balls which at impact on the wall of the
  \nvessel recoil without loss of energy and \nmomentum. If the t/z-plane coincides
  \nwith the wall the ^-component of the \nmomentum mg of a molecule is changed \ninto
  wf ; hence the momentum 2m is \ntransferred to the wall. Let n v be the \nnumber
  of molecules per unit of volume \nhaving the velocity vector v. If one \nconstructs
  a cylinder upon a piece of the \nwall of area unity and side v dt, all mole- \ncules
  in it will strike the part of the wall \nwithin the cylinder in the time-element
  dt\\ the volume of the \ncylinder is dt, hence the number of collisions per unit
  surface \nand unit time, gn v and the total momentum transferred 2m 2 n v . \nThis
  has first to be summed over all angles of incidence (i.e. \nover a hemisphere);
  the result is obviously the same as one-half \nof the sum over the total sphere,
  namely \n\n\n\n\nFia. 9. \n\n\n\nwhere n v is the number of molecules per unit of
  volume, with a \nvelocity of magnitude v (but any direction). Now the 'principle
  \nof molecular chaos' is used according to which \n\nP = ? = ~? = \n\n\n\nHence
  the last expression is equal to n v lfi 9 and the pressure is \n\n3 \n\nfinally

  \n\n\n\nThe total (kinetic) energy in the volume V is \n\n\n\nhence one obtains
  the equation (6.1) of the text, \n\nVp = |Z7. \n\nNow one can apply the considerations
  of Appendix, 9, using the \nexperimental fact expressed by Boyle's law (that all
  states of a \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX 163 \n\ngas at a fixed empirical temperature # satisfy
  pV = const.). \nThen one obtains \n\npV = RT, U = \\RT, (2) \n\nas stated in (6.2)

  m 2 cannot appear; hence \n\n/ = fcfcpt) = ^(H), (5) \n\nas stated in the text.
  \n\n13. (VI. p. 51.) Maxwell's functional equation \n\nTo solve the equation (6.10)
  it suffices to take 3 = 0; putting \n\n\n\nhas \n\nf(x+y) = #*#(?). (1) \n\nDifferentiating
  partially with respect to x, \n\nf(x+y) = f (*tf<y), (2) \n\nand dividing by the
  original equation \n\n/'(s+y) = \n\nf(x+y) \n\n\n\n154 APPENDIX \n\n\n\nNow, the

  (VI. p. 52.) The method of the most probable distribu- \ntion \n\nWe have to determine
  the probability of a distribution of \nequal particles over N cells, where n^ of
  them are in the first cell, \nn 2 of them in the second, etc. (n 1 +n 2 +...+n N
  = n). To do this \nwe first take the particles in a fixed order; then the probability
  of \ndistribution (n v n 2 ,..., n N ) is, according to the multiplication law,

  particles. If \none performs first all n\\ permutations, one gets too many cases,
  \nas all those distributions, which differ only by permuting the \nparticles in
  each cell, count only once. Therefore one has to \ndivide n\\ by the number of all
  these permutations inside a cell, \nthat is by n 1 !w 2 L..%! The total result is
  the expression (6.15) \n\nP (ni ,n 2 ,...,n N ) - -j-f^oM...^. (1) \n\nwhich is

  of n! by Stirling's \nformula. The simplest way to obtain it is this: write \n\n=
  log(1.2.3...n) = log l+log2+log3+... -flog n \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX 155 \n\nn \n\nand
  replace the sum J log fc by the integral \n\nn \n\nj logic dx = 7i(logn 1). \nb
  \n\nA more satisfactory derivation is the following: One can represent \nn! by an
  integral and evaluate it with the help of the so-called \nmethod of steepest descent,
  which plays a great part in the \nmodern treatment of statistical mechanics due
  to Darwin and \nFowler (see p. 54). The approximate evaluation of n! may serve \nas
  a simple example of this method. \nIf the identity \n\n~-(e~ x x n ) = e- x x n

  \n\n00 \n\nT(n+l) = j e~ x x n dx (n > -1), (2) \n\nused, one obtains T(n+l) = nT(n).
  (3) \n\nAs F(l) = 1, one has \n\nT(2) = l.T(l) = 1, T(3) = 2F(2) = 1.2, \n\nr(4)
  = 3r(3)= 1.2.3, \nand in general T(n-\\-l) = n\\. (4) \n\nThe integral (2) can be
  written \n\nCO \n\nr(n+ 1 ) = J e'C^ dx, f(n, x) = -x+n log x. (5) \n\n\n\nThe function
  f(n, x) (hence also the integrand) has a maximum \nwhere \n\n\n\n/'(*) = -1+ = 0,
  \nx \n\ni.e. at x = n, and \n\nf(n) == n+nlogn, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n156 APPENDIX \n\nThe
  expansion of f(x) in the neighbourhood of the maximum \nx = n is therefore \n\n\n\nf(x)
  = -n+nlogn (x- \n\n\n\nand one has \n\n\n\n00 \n\nn J \n\n\n\nwhere the dots indicate
  terms of higher order which can be easily \nworked out. If these are neglected the
  integral becomes \n\n\n\nJ e -(x-n)'i2n dx = J e -t' l2n d \n\n-n \n\n\n\nfor large
  n. Hence \n\nnl = T(n+l) = J(27rn)e- n n n +... (6) \n\nand log/i! = nlogn n-\\-^log(27rn)-\\-
  ..., (7) \n\nwhere the highest terms agree with the previous result. \nThus the
  logarithm of the probability P can be written \n\nlogP = 2^K)+const., (8) \n\n8
  \n\nwhere <f> 8 (n 8 ) = ^(logo^-log/g. (9) \n\n(8) and (9) are, for equal co's,

  one must apply the second theorem of thermodynamics, \nwhich refers to quasi-static
  processes involving external work \n(for instance by changing the volume). \n\nBy
  an infinitely slow change of external parameters a l9 a&... 9 \nthe energies of

  a very small unit of energy is chosen so that all \nthe r are positive integers,
  which may be ordered in such a way \nthatcj ^ e 2 ^ 8 ^ ... ^ e^; also, by choosing
  the zero of energy \nsuitably we can arrange that e x = 0. \n\nThen we expand {F(z)}
  n into powers of z according to the \nmultinomial theorem and obtain a series of
  terms \n\nn ! \n\n\n\nby collecting all these terms with the same factor z u we
  obtain all \nthe P(n 1 ,7i 2 ,...,7i^ v ) which belong to the same value of \n\nU
  = I e r n r . \n\nr \n\nNow we substitute 1 for each/(r& r ) in (2) and obtain in
  this \nway the total probability of these distributions which have a \ngiven total
  energy U, in the form: \n\ny P = coefficient of z u in {F(z)} n . \n\nThis coefficient
  can be evaluated by Cauchy's theorem, if z is \nregarded as a complex variable;
  one has \n\n\n\nwhere the integral is taken round a closed contour surrounding \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX
  161 \n\nthe origin in the z-plane. The integral can be evaluated \napproximately
  by the method of steepest descent which we have \nalready explained, for real variables,
  in Appendix 14, for the \nF-function. \nThe first step is to express the integrand
  in the form \n\n} n = e<**\\ O(z) = nlog F(z)-(U+l)logz. \n\n\n\n\nboth log F(z)
  and its derivative increase monotonically from a \nfinite value to oo as z moves
  along the real axis between and \noo. Also -log z and its negative derivative z~
  l decrease mono- \ntonically along the same path. Hence G(z) can have only one \nextremum,
  a minimum, on the real axis between and oo, and \nthis minimum will be extremely
  steep if n and U are large. \n\nAlso let z be the point of the real axis where the
  minimum \nhappens to be; then at this point the first derivative of G(z) \nvanishes
  and the second is positive and very large. Hence in the \ndirection orthogonal to
  the axis the integrand must have a very \nsharp maximum. If we take as contour of
  integration a circle \nabout through z , only the immediate neighbourhood of this
  \npoint will contribute appreciably to the integral. \n\nThe minimum z is to be
  found as root of the equation \n\n\n\nand one has \n\n\n\nThis shows that for large
  U and n a proportional increase in U \nand n will not change the root z , while
  G\"(z ), which is positive, \ncan be made arbitrarily large. \n\n5131 XT \n\n\n\n12
  APPENDIX \n\nPutting z = z +iy one obtains for the integral (4) \n\n00 \n\nV P =
  JL e W> f e-Wto*i dy, \n\n00 \n\nwhere the terms of higher than second order are
  omitted and the \nlimits of integration are taken to be 00 because of the sharp

  shows that the function F(z) is equivalent to the partition \nfunction introduced
  in (14.24), p. 158. \n\nIf one now takes the logarithm of (6) the leading terms
  are \n\n\n\nOn the other hand, one has from (5) to the same approximation \n\np-

  hence \n\n(10) \n\n\n\nComparison with (14.25) shows that the entropy in this theory
  \n\nis to be defined by \n\n= rw = HogYP, (11) \n\n(if) \n\nwhile in the Appendix,
  14, the definition was S = Mog P, where \nP means the maximum value of the probability.
  \n\nThus it becomes clear that owing to the enormous sharpness of \nthe maximum
  it does not matter whether one averages over all \nstates or picks out only the
  state of maximum probability. \nIn fact, the two methods, that of the most probable
  distribution \nand that of mean values, do not differ as much as it appears. \nBoth
  use asymptotic approximations for the combinatorial \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX \n\n\n\n163
  \n\n\n\nquantities: either for each factorial in the probability before \naveraging,
  or for the resultant integral after averaging. The \nresults are completely identical.
  Yet there are apostles and dis- \nciples for each of the two doctrines who regard
  their creed as the \nonly orthodox one. In my opinion it is just a question of training
  \nand practice which formalism is more convenient. The method \nof Darwin and Fowler
  has perhaps the advantage of greater \nflexibility. The partition function is nothing
  but a 'generating \nfunction' for the probabilities, and allows the representation
  of \nthese by complex integrals. In this way the powerful methods \nof the theory
  of analytic functions of complex integrals can be \nutilized for thermodynamics.
  \n\n16. (VI. p. 56.) Boltzmann's collision integral \n\nThe collision integral (6.24)
  can be derived in the following way. \n\nThe gas is supposed to be so \ndiluted
  that only binary en- \ncounters are to be taken into \naccount. Then the relative
  \nmotion of two colliding particles \nhas an initial and a final straight \nline
  asymptote. \n\nTo specify an encounter we \ndefine the 'cross-section* as the \nplane
  through a point with a \nnormal parallel to the relative velocity l^ 5 2 of two
  particles \nbefore an encounter and introduce the position vector b in this \nplane.
  We erect a cylindrical volume element over the area db \nwith the height |i~ 2!
  &t\\ then all particles in this element \nhaving the relative velocity 5x 2 w ^
  P ass through db in time \ndt. The probability of a particle 2 passing a particle
  1 at \nwithin the cross-section element db is obtained from the \nproduct /(I) dx
  1 d? 1 /(2) dx 2 d 2 by replacing dx 2 by the volume \nof the cylinder |i 2! dbdt,
  \n\n\n\n\nFia. 10. \n\n\n\nEvery encounter changes the velocities and removes therefore
  \nthe particle 1 from the initial range. The total loss is obtained \nby integrating
  over all db and d 2 : \n\n(i) \n\n\n\n164 APPENDIX \n\nBut there are other encounters
  such that the final state of the \nparticle 1 is in the element dx l d^ l ; they
  are called inverse en- \ncounters. \n\nIf the final velocities of the direct encounters
  are i, ?' 2 the \nlaws of collision (conservation of momentum and energy) allow
  \none to express i, 2 in terms of x , 2 and two further parameters \n(the components
  of b in the cross-section plane). These relations \nare linear in i 2 and may be
  shortly written \n\n5i), (2) \n\n\n\nwhere 3f represents a 6 x 6 matrix. It is obvious

  \n\nThe state of a mechanical system can be represented by a \npoint in the 6-ZV-dimensional
  phase space p, q, and its motion by \na single orbit on a 'surface' of constant
  energy in this space. \nFollowing this orbit one must come very near to the initial
  point; \nthe time needed will be considerable, in the range of observa- \nbility.
  This is the quasi-period considered by Zermelo. Yet \nthere are much smaller quasi-periods
  if one takes into account \nthat all particles are equal and indistinguishable;
  the gas is \nalready in almost the same state as the initial one if any particle
  \nhas come near the initial position of any other. Then the orbit \ndefined above
  is not closed at all, yet the system has performed \nanother kind of quasi-period.
  These periods are presumably \nsmall; I cannot give a mathematical proof, but it
  seems evident \nfrom the overwhelming probability of distributions near the \n\n\n\n170
  APPENDIX \n\nmost probable one. Einstein has this quasi-period in mind. It \nis
  certainly extremely short in the scale of observable time- \nintervals, and one
  can therefore say that the representing 'point* \nsweeps over the whole energy surface
  if this point is defined \nwithout regard to the individuality of the particles
  (i.e. if an \nenormous number of single points corresponding to permutation \nof
  all particles are regarded as one point). \n\n20. (VI. p. 63.) Fluctuations and
  Brownian motion \n\nThe statistical conception of matter in bulk implies that \nspontaneous
  deviations from equilibrium are possible. There are \nseveral different types of
  problems, some of them concerned \nwith the deviations from the average or fluctuations
  found by \nrepeated observations, others with actual motion of suspended \nvisible
  particles the Brownian motion. \n\nThe simplest case of fluctuations is that of
  density, i.e. of the \nnumber of particles in a small part cuF of the whole volume
  V. \nOne has in this case two cells of relative size a> and 1 o>, and the \nprobability
  of a distribution %,n a = nn ly is according to \n(6.15) or (14.1) \n\n\n\nThe expectation
  value of n^ found by repeated experiments is \n\n\n\no \n\nor \n\n\n\nAccording
  to the binomial theorem this reduces to \n\nn^ = na>, (2) \n\nas might be expected.

  small fraction, one obtains the well-known fluctuation \nformula for independent
  events \n\n(S^ = ^. (6) \n\nThis is directly applicable to the density fluctuation
  of an ideal \ngas and can be used to explain the scattering of light by a gas, \nas
  observed for instance in the blue of the sky (Lord Rayleigh; \nAtomic Physics, Appendix
  IV, p. 280). \n\nThere are also fluctuations of other properties of a gas. As \nthe
  state of a fluid is determined by two independent macro- \nscopic variables (p,
  V for instance), it suffices to calculate the \nfluctuation of one further quantity.
  The most convenient one \nis the energy. \n\nThe following consideration holds,
  however, not only for ideal \ngases, but for any set of independent equal systems
  of given \ntotal (or mean) energy; it supposes only that the distribution \nis canonical.

  the mean energy is known as a function of temperature, \nhence of j8, one obtains
  its fluctuation by differentiation. For \nexample, for an ideal gas one has u =
  c v T = (c v /k)f3~ l 9 hence \n(Ac) 2 = c v kT 2 = (k/c v )u 2 . Another application,
  to the fluctua- \ntion of radiation, is made in section VIII, p. 79. \n\nIf one
  wishes to determine the fluctuations of a part of a body \nwhich cannot be decomposed
  into independent systems, these \nsimple methods are not applicable. \n\nEinstein
  has invented a most ingenious method which can be \napplied in such cases. It consists
  in reversing Boltzmann's \nequation S = klogP, (11) \n\ntaking 8 as a known function
  qf observable parameters, and \ndetermining the probability P from it, \n\nP = e

  \ncell is \n\n\n\n\n= -jjjlog J e-r* df, - , \n\n\n\nor (A^J 2 = kT*c v . (16) \n\nThis
  result is formally identical with that for an ideal gas ob- \ntained above, yet
  holds also if c v is any function of T. \n\nIn a similar way other fluctuations
  can be expressed in terms \nof macroscopic quantities. \n\nWe now turn to the theory
  of Brownian motion which is also \ndue to Einstein. His original papers on this
  subject are collected \nin a small volume Investigations on the Theory of the Brownian
  \nMovement, by R. Fiirth, translated by A. D. Cowper (Methuen \n& Co. Ltd., London,
  1926) and make delightful reading. Here \nI give the main ideas of this theory in
  a slight modification \nformulated independently by Planck and Fokker. \n\nLet f(x,
  t) dx be the probability that the centre of a colloidal \n(visible) particle has
  an x-coordinate between x and x-\\-dt at \ntime t. The particle may be subject to
  a constant force F and \nto the collisions of the surrounding molecules. The latter
  will \nproduce a friction-like effect; if the particle is big compared with \nthe
  molecules, its acceleration may be neglected and the velocity \n\n\n\n174 APPENDIX
  \n\ncomponent in the ^-direction assumed to be proportional to the \n\nforce f =
  BF, (17) \n\nwhere B is called the 'mobility*. Apart from this quasi-continu- \nous
  action, the collisions will produce tiny irregular displace- \nments which can be
  described by a statistical law, namely, by \ndefining a function <f>(x) which represents
  the probability for a \nparticle to be displaced in the positive ^-direction by
  x during a \nsmall but finite interval of time r. \n\nThen one obtains a kind of
  collision equation (which is simpler \nthan Boltzmann's in the kinetic theory of
  gases, as no attempt \nis made to analyse the mechanism of collision in detail)
  : The con- \n\nvective increase of f(x, t) in the time-interval T,T-/ = T( + ~-)

  \n\nWe consider now the motion of the particles without an \nexternal field (F =
  0), under the action of the collisions only. \nThen (20) reads ~ f ^ f \n\ni= D
  w < 24 > \n\nThis is the well-known equation of diffusion. Einstein's main \nresult
  consists in the double formula (23) which connects the \nmean square displacement
  with the coefficient of diffusion D and \nwith temperature and mobility. \n\nIf
  the particle is known to be at a given position, say x = 0, \nat t = 0, the probability
  of finding it at x after the time t is the \nfollowing solution of (24): \n\n\n\nthe
  mean square of the coordinate, or the 'spread* of probability \nafter the time t
  is found by a simple calculation: \n\n\n\n2 = J x*f(x, t)dx = 2Dt, (26) \n\n00 \n\nwhich
  for t = T is equal to the mean square displacement (A#) 2 \ngiven by (23). \nThese
  formulae can be used in different ways to determine \n\n\n\n176 APPENDIX \n\nBoltzmann's
  constant k, or Avogadro's number N = R/k (where \njR is the gas constant per mole),
  i.e. the number of molecules per \nmole. A static method consists in observing the
  sedimentation \nunder gravity of a colloid solution; then F = -wgr, where ra is
  \nthe mass of the colloid particle, and the number of particles \ndecreases with
  height according to the law (22), which now reads \n\n\n\nn = \n\n\n\nIn order to
  apply this formula one has to determine the mass. \nFor spherical particles m =
  (47r/3)r 3 />, where p is the density and \nr the radius. The mobility of a sphere
  in a liquid of viscosity rj \nhas been calculated by Stokes from the hydrodynamical
  equa- \ntions, with the result 1 \n\nB = i- ; (27) \n\n67777?-' v ' \n\nhence it

  \n\nAs can be measured, r can be found, if p and rj are known, and \nfinally m.
  \n\nAnother method is a dynamical one. One observes the dis- \nplacements Aa^, A#
  2 ,..., of a single colloid particle in equal inter- \nvals r of time and forms
  the mean square (A#) 2 . Then using the \nsame method as just described for determining
  the radius r, \none finds B from (27) and then k from (23). \n\nIn this way the
  first reliable determinations of N have been \nmade. Among those who have developed
  the theory M. v. \nSmoluchowski has played a distinguished part, while the first
  \nsystematic measurements are due to J. Perrin. \n\nA new and interesting approach

  between liquid and gas is not so sharp and \nmay even be said to disappear above
  the critical state. However, \nif one is not specially concerned with these intermediate
  con- \nditions there is a wide region where liquid and gas can be dis- \ntinguished
  by the extreme difference of density. From the \natomistic standpoint this has to
  be formulated thus: \n\nThe potential energy <J>(x (t>) , x ( ^) between two molecules
  at \nx w and x f) decreases rapidly with the distance between their \nmass centres,
  and (except in the case of ions, where Coulomb \nforces act) a distance r , small
  by macroscopic standards, may \nbe specified, beyond which the interaction may without
  error \nbe assumed to vanish completely. In a liquid proper, there are \nmany molecules
  within this distance r of a given molecule; in a \ngas there are usually none, and
  the probability that there is more \nthan one is very small, except near condensation.
  The neglect \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX 181 \n\nof this small probability is equivalent to
  the assumption of \n'binary encounters' in gas-theory. Green has shown that when
  \nthis assumption is made, on taking q = 1 in the equations (6.44) \nand (6.45)
  of the text, \n\n-[#i>/i]^> (1) \n\n\n\none obtains Boltzmann's collision equations
  (6.46), (6.47). \n\nTo prove this we first work out the expression S l using the
  \ndefinition (6.5) of the Poisson bracket and of the operator x> \n\n\n\n(see also
  22.13). With the assumption of binary encounters / 2 \ncan be expressed in terms
  of / x by using the mechanical laws of \ncollision. \n\nConsider the motion of two

  events in fluids which occur beyond the range \nof interaction must be considered

  is \nalways made in gas-theory, that , x^, x|> 2) may be replaced by \nt, x (1)
  and x (2) on the right-hand side of (4) (but of course not \n?o 1) 5o 2) > by J*

  nevertheless it is not without importance, \nfor it allows small deviations from
  Maxwell's velocity distribu- \ntion law (and other 'fluctuations'), which would
  otherwise be \nunexplainable, as this law is a rigorous consequence of Boltz- \nmann's

  integrals (conservation of energy, \nmomentum, and angular momentum). The resulting
  formulae \nare the same as used in Boltzmann's theory (see Appendix, 16). \nThe
  reduction of $ 2 can be performed without making use of \nexplicit expressions.
  One has only to remark that \n\n\n\nnow satisfies the equation \n\n[# 2 ,/ 2 ] =

  can be performed by imagining the sphere to \nbe partitioned by elementary tubes
  parallel to the relative \nvelocity J- (2) -- (1) ; one may then integrate, first
  over a typical \ntube specified by the cross-section radius b, perpendicular from
  \nthe centre of the sphere to the tube (see Appendix, 16), and then \nover all values
  of b. At the beginning of the tube, where \n\n\n\nthe interaction between the molecules

  just \nas in Boltzmann's theory. Thus one obtains \n\n>flg, (9) \n\nwhich is identical
  with (6.47) of the text and the collision integral \nin (16.8). \n\nThis derivation
  is not more complicated than Boltzmann's \noriginal one' and is preferable because
  it reveals clearly the \nassumptions made. \n\n24. (VII. p. 72.) Irreversibility
  In fluids \n\nA rigorous proof of the irreversibility in dense matter from the \nclassical
  standpoint seems to be very difficult, or at least ex- \ntremely tedious. Green
  has, however, suggested a derivation \nwhich, though not quite rigorous, is plausible
  enough and \ncertainly based on reasonable approximations. \n\nIt has tojbe shown
  that the entropy 8 defined by (7.1) never \ndecreases in time, so that \n\n\n\nsatisfies
  the equation \n\n1 ), (2) \n\n\n\nwhich expresses that one particle of unknown position
  and \nvelocity is added to a system of N particles. \n\nIf <I> is the total potential

  same, as/^ a,ndf N+1 can be assumed to \nbe symmetric in regard to all particles.
  Hence \n\n\n\nNow the reasoning follows very closely that of Appendix, 23, \nwhere
  (23.3) was transformed into the integrable expression \n(23.8) with the help of
  the identity ( 23.7). \n\nFor this purpose one introduces instead of the velocities
  of the \ntwo particles (1) and (^+1) appearing explicitly in (4) new \nvariables,
  namely their total momentum m, two components \nof the relative angular momentum

  the same reasoning \nas in Appendix, 23, partitioning the x (jv+1) -domain by tubes
  \nformed by the trajectories of (jV+1) relative to (1), where \nm, a, w are constant,
  and one can perform the integration with \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX 185 \n\nrespect to x (

  each end of the trajectory where the \ninteraction O C1 - JV>+1) can be neglected,
  the function f N+1 would \nfactorize into fi N+1) f N , provided no other particle
  were near to \nthe particle (JV'+l). \n\nThis is, of course, not the case; but it
  seems to be reasonable to \nassume that the factorization is at least approximately
  correct \nas the action of the rest will nearly cancel. This is the simplifica-
  \ntion made by Green. It is clear that it could be corrected by a \nmore detailed
  consideration; but let us be content with it. \n\nSince the sphere around x (1)

  \n\nNow one can apply the same transformations as for gases, \nas explained in Appendix,
  17, which lead from (17.3) to (17.4), \nexchanging the dashed and undashed variables,

  account of these things \nin my own book Atomic Physics (Blackie & Son, Glasgow;
  \n4th edition 1948), which is constructed in a similar way to the \npresent lectures;
  the text uses very little mathematics, while a \nseries of appendixes contain short
  and rigorous proofs of the \ntheorems used. For instance, Einstein's law of the

  short derivation of the formula = me 2 given in A. Ph. \nAppendix VII, p. 288. Whenever

  \n\n27. (VIII. p. 91.) Operator calculus in quantum mechanics \n\nThe failure of
  matrix mechanics to deal with aperiodic motions, \ncontinuous spectra, was less
  a matter of conception than of \npractical methods. An indication of using integral
  operators \ninstead of matrices is contained in a paper by M. Born, \nW. Heisenberg,
  and P. Jordan, Z.f. Phys. 35, 557 (1926), which \nfollows immediately after Heisenberg's
  first publication. The \nidea that physical quantities correspond to linear operators
  in \ngeneral acting on functions was suggested by M. Born and \nN. Wiener, Journ.
  Math, and Phys. 5, 84 (1926) and Z. f. Phys. \n36, 174 (1926), where in particular
  operators of the form \n\n\n\n-T \nwere used. Here the kernel q(t,s) is a 'continuous
  matrix', also \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX 189 \n\nintroduced by Dirac. This paper contains
  also the representation \nof special quantities by differential operators (with
  respect to \ntime) which satisfy identically the commutation law between \nenergy
  and time EttE = ih. \n\nSchrOdinger's discovery, which was made quite independently,
  \nconsists in using a representation where the coordinates are \nmultiplication
  operators and the momenta differential operators, \nso that the commutation laws
  \n\n\n\nare identically satisfied. This opened the way to finding the \nrelation
  between matrix mechanics and wave mechanics and \nto the later development of the
  general transformation theory of \nquantum mechanics which is brilliantly represented
  in Dirac's \nfamous book. \n\nThe early development of quantum mechanics as represented
  \nin text-books has become rather legendary. To mention a few \ninstances: the matrices
  and the commutation law [q,p] = 1 \nwhich are -traditionally called Heisenberg's,
  are not explicitly \ncontained in his first publication: W. Heisenberg, Z. f. Phys.
  \n\n33, 879 (1925); his formulae correspond only to the diagonal \nterms of the
  commutator. The complete formulae in matrix \nnotation are in the paper by M. Born
  and P. Jordan, Z.f. Phys. \n\n34, 858 (1925). Further, the perturbation theory of
  quantum \nmechanics, traditionally called Schrftdinger's, is contained \nalready
  in the next publication of Heisenberg, Jordan, and \nmyself (quoted at the beginning),
  not only for matrices, but also \nfor vectors on which these matrices operate, and
  not only for \nsimple eigenvalues, but also degenerate systems. The only \ndifference
  of SchrOdinger's derivation is that he starts from a \nrepresentation with continuous
  wave functions which he aban- \ndons at once in favour of a discontinuous one (by
  a Fourier \ntransformation) . \n\n28. (IX. p. 94.) General formulation of the uncertainty
  \nprinciple \n\nThe derivation of the most general form of the uncertainty \nprinciple
  can be found in my book (A. Ph. A. XXII, p. 326). \nAs it is fundamental for the
  reasoning in these lectures, I shall \ngive it here in a little more abstract form.
  \n\n\n\n190 APPENDIX \n\nWe assume that for a complex operator C = A+iB and its
  \nconjugate C* = AiB the mean value of the product CC* is \nreal and not negative:
  \n\nOC*\">0, (1) \n\nwhere the bar indicates any form of linear averaging, as described
  \nin the text. Then writing XB instead of B, where A is a real para- \nmeter, one
  has \n\n\n\n(A+iXB)(A-i\\B) = A z +BW-~ri[A, B]X > 0, (2) \nwhere the abbreviation
  (9.4) \n\n\n\n(3) \n\nis used. As the left-hand side of (2) is real and also the
  first two \nterms on the right, it follows that [A, B] is real. The minimum \nof

  in A. Ph. A. XII, p. 296, A. XXXII, p. 357, and in \nmany other books, for instance,
  Heisenberg, The Physical \nPrinciples of the Quantum Theory. \n\n29. (IX. p. 97.)
  Dirac's derivation of the Poisson brackets \nin quantum mechanics \n\nIt is fashionable
  to-day to represent quantum mechanics in an \naxiomatic way without explaining why
  just these axioms have \nbeen chosen, justifying them only by the success. I think
  that \nno real understanding of the theory can be obtained in this way. \nOne must
  follow to some degree the historical development and \nlearn how things have actually
  happened. Now the decisive \nfact was the conviction held by theoretical physicists
  that many \nfeatures of Hamiltonian mechanics must be right, in spite of the \nfundamentally
  different aspect of quantum theory. This con- \nviction was based on the surprising
  successes of Bohr's principle \nof correspondence. In fact, the solution of the
  problem consisted \nin preserving the formalism of Hamiltonian mechanics as a whole
  \nwith the only modification that the physical quantities are to be \nrepresented
  by non-commuting quantities. \n\nIf this is accepted, there is a most elegant consideration
  of \nDirac which leads in the shortest way to the rule for translating \nformulae
  of classical mechanics into quantum mechanics. It \nstarts from the fact that classical
  mechanics can be condensed \ninto the equation \n\n0, (1) \n\n\n\nwhich any function
  f(t,q,p) representing a quantity carried by \nthe motion must satisfy. Here the
  Poisson bracket is used \n\n\n\nIf (1) is to be generalized for non-commuting quantities,
  it is \nnecessary to consider how the Poisson bracket should be trans- \nlated into
  the new language. \n\nDirac uses the fact that these brackets have a series of formal
  \nproperties, namely \n\n\n\n192 APPENDIX \n\nwhere c is a constant ; further \n\n\n\nand
  finally ' i (5) \n\n\n\nHere the factors are written in a definite order, though
  in \nclassical mechanics this does not matter. We have t f o do so if we \nwant
  to use these expressions for non- commuting quantities, \nand the rule followed
  is simply to leave the order of factors un- \nchanged. \n\nThe question is, What
  do the brackets mean in this case ? To see \nthis, we form the bracket [ x 2 > ?h
  ^2] * n ^ wo ways, using the two \nformulae (5) first in one order, then in the
  opposite one. Then \n\n\n\nand in the same way \n\n\n\nEquating these two expressions
  one obtains \n\n[l> >?l](f 2 ^2 ^2 f 2) = (^1 ^l ^1 f l)[f 2 ^2]- ( 6 ) \n\nAs [g
  v T^J must be independent of 2 , ^ 2 an( i y i ce versa, it follows \n\n\n\nwhere
  A is independent of all four quantities and commutes with \nf i ^i~~ ^i f i an(
  i 2 7 ?2~~' ^2 ^2* Hence A is a number. That it must \nbe purely imaginary, A =
  ifi, cannot be derived in such a formal \nway; but it follows from considerations
  like those used in the \nprevious appendix, where it is shown that a reasonable
  definition \nof averages implies (28.3) that \n\n[f,ij] = -^-ij (8) \n\nis real..
  Thus it is established that the Poisson brackets in \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX 193 \n\nquantum
  theory correspond to properly normalized commu- \ntators. \n\nIf one inserts in
  the classical expression (2) for and 17 a \ncoordinate or a momentum, one finds
  \n\n[rffa] = > [Pr*A] = > [?r>A] = 8 rs> () \n\nwhere . = 1, S ra = for r ^ s. \n\nThe
  same relations (9) must be postulated to hold in quantum \nmechanics. In this way
  the fundamental commutation laws are \nobtained. \n\n30. (IX. p. 100.) Perturbation
  theory for the density matrix \n\nWe consider the problem of solving the equation
  \n\n^ = [#, P ], H = H +V, (1) \n\nwhere the perturbation function F is small. \n\nThe
  method is essentially the same as that used for the \ncorresponding problem in matrix
  or wave mechanics. \n\nAssume that A represents the eigenvalues of a complete set
  \nof integrals A of H , so that [H , A] = and H becomes \ndiagonal in the A-representation;
  put \n\nS (A, A) = E, H (A', A') = E' 9 while H (A, A') = for A ^ A'. (2) \nIntroduce
  instead of p and V the functions a and U given by \n\n\n\nThen one has \n\n\n\nf
  \nF(A,A') = '- \n\n\n\ni 8t (i dt \n\n(H p~ P H )(\\,X f ) = (JS/~^)a(A,A' \nHence

  an integration over E', the \nlatter can be performed on the coefficients J(\\,E\\

  \nare given by \n\nwhich combines the equations (9.27) and (9.28) of the text. \n\nAs
  mentioned in the text, Green has found a formula which \nallows one to calculate
  the higher approximations in a very \nsimple way. This formula is so elegant and
  useful that I shall \ngive it here, though without proof (which can be found in
  the \nAppendix I, p. 178, of the paper by M. Born and H. S. Green, \nProc. Roy.
  Soe. A, 192, 166, 1948). Starting from the equation \n(7) or _ , _ \n\n\n\n196 APPENDIX
  \n\nwhere U is known for a given perturbation V by (3), one forms the \nsuccessive

  expansion \n\n\n\nIf the initial condition u 2 = for t = is added, u% can be deter-
  \nmined by integrating this series term by term. \nThen one forms \n\n\n\nand the
  expansion \n\n\n\nfrom which one can determine % so that u% = for = 0. \n\nThe second
  suffix Z in ?% has been chosen to indicate the power \nof F which is involved in
  the expression; one has u% = (^(F 2 *\"\" 1 ) \nand this decreases rapidly with
  k when F or t are small. This rule \nmakes it possible to construct t* 4 , %,...,
  in a similar manner. \nThen one has the solution of (4) \n\na = e u e u *e u *...p
  Q ...e- u *e- u *e- u (19) \n\nfrom which p is obtained by (3). \n\nThe explicit
  expressions for the expansion (5) of a are \n\n\n\n(20) \n\nThese formulae will
  be useful for many purposes in quantum \ntheory. Concerning thermodynamics, the
  third-order terms will \nhave a direct application to the theory of fluctuations
  and \nBrownian motion. The customary theory derives these pheno- \nmena from considerations
  about the probability of distributions \nin an assembly which differs from the most
  probable one. The \ntheory described here deals with one single system with the
  \nmethods of quantum mechanics (which allows anyhow only \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX 197 \n\nstatistical
  predictions); deviations from the average will then \ndepend on higher approximations.
  It can be hoped that this idea \nleads to a new approach to the theory of fluctuations
  in quantum \nmechanics. \n\n31. (IX. p. 112.) The functional equation of quantum

  \n\ntreated in Appendix, 13, and has as solution general exponen- \ntial functions;

  Degeneration of gases \n\nThe theory of gas degeneration is treated in my book Atomic
  \nPhysics, but in a way which appears not to conform with the \ngeneral principles
  of quantum statistics as explained in these \nlectures. According to these one always
  has in statistical equili- \nbrium canonical distribution, P = e*~& E , while the
  presenta- \ntion in A. Ph. gives the impression that, by means of a modified \nmethod
  of statistical enumeration, a different result is obtained. \nThis impression is
  only due to the terms used, which were those \nof the earlier authors (Bose, Einstein,
  Fermi, Sommerfeld), while \nin fact there is perfect agreement between the general
  theory \nand the application to gases. A simple and clear exposition of \nthis subject
  is found in the little book by E. SchrOdinger, \nStatistical Thermodynamics (Cambridge
  University Press, 1946). \nI shall give here a short outline of the theory. \n\nIn
  classical theory an ideal gas is regarded as a system of inde- \npendent particles.
  In quantum theory this is not permitted, \nbecause the particles are indistinguishable.
  If ^(x* 1 *) and \n^r 2 (x (2) ), or shortly ^j(l) and 2 (2)> are the wave functions
  of two \nidentical particles with the energies E l and E 2 , the SchrCdinger \nequation
  for the system of both particles, without interaction, \nhas obviously the solution
  ^i(l)0 2 (2) with the energy E^+E^ \nbut as the particles are identical there is
  another solution \n\n\n\n198 APPENDIX \n\nbelonging to the same energy, namely M2)M1)-
  Hence any \nlinear combination of these is also a solution. Two of these, \nnamely
  the symmetric one and the anti-symmetric one, \n\n&(1, 2) = Ml W(2)+&(2)&(1), \n^1,2)
  = ^1)^2)-M2)^(1) \n\nhave a special property: the squares of their moduli, |/r g
  | 2 and \n|j/rj 2 , are unchanged if the particles are interchanged. One can \nfurther
  show that they do not 'combine', i.e. the mixed inter- \naction integrals (matrix
  elements) vanish, \n\n0, (2) \n\n\n\nfor any operator A symmetric in the particles.
  Hence they repre- \nsent two entirely independent states of the system; each state
  \nbeing characterized by two energy-levels of the single particle \noccupied, without
  saying by which particle. \n\nThe same holds for any number of particles. If E l
  ,E 2 ,...,E n \nare the energies of the states of the isolated particles, the total
  \nsystem (without interaction) has not only the eigenfunction \n1/^(1)^2(2). ..$

  all linear combinations of these. \nThere are in particular two combinations, the
  symmetric one \nand the antisymmetric one, \n\nMl, 2,..., n) = P \n\n\n\n(3) \n(+
  for even, for odd permutations), \n\nwhich have the same simple properties as described
  in the case \nof two particles: i/j 8 remains unaltered when two particles are \nexchanged,
  while i/j a (which can be written as a determinant) \nchanges its sign; hence |</rj
  2 and |^ a | 2 remain unchanged. \nFurther, the two states do not combine, a fact
  expressed by \nformula (2). \n\nThe functions if/ 8 and i// a describe the state
  of the n-particle \nsystem in such a way that the particles have lost their indi-
  \nviduality; the only thing which counts is the number of particles \nhaving a definite
  energy-level. \n\nExperiment has shown that this description is adequate for all
  \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX 199 \n\nparticles in nature; every type of particle belongs either
  to one \nor the other of these two classes. \n\nThe eigenfunctions of electrons
  belong, in view of spectroscopic \nand other evidence, to the antisymmetric type
  ; hence they vanish \nif two of the single eigenfunctions ^ a (/J) are identical,
  i.e. if two \nparticles are in the same quantum state. This is the mathe- \nmatical
  formulation of Pauli's exclusion principle. Nucleons \n(neutrons or protons) and
  neutrinos are of the same type; one \nspeaks of a Fermi-Dirac (F.D.) gas. Photons
  and mesons, \nhowever, and many nuclei (containing an even number of \nnucleons)
  are of the other type, having symmetric eigen- \nfunctions; they form a Bose-Einstein
  (B.E.) gas. \n\nIn both cases the total energy may be written \n\nE = \n\n\n\nwhere
  v e 2 ,... are the possible energy -levels of the single particles \nand n l9 n
  2 ,... integers which indicate how often this level appears \nin the original sum
  E l -\\-E^-\\-...-\\-E n (where each E k was attri- \nbuted to ofie definite particle).
  \n\nThe sum of these occupation numbers n v n 2 ,... \n\n... = 2,n 8 = n (5) \n\n\n\nmay
  be given or it may not. The latter holds if particles are \nabsorbed or emitted,
  as in the case of photons. For a B.E. gas, \nincluding the case of photons, there
  is no restriction of the n 8 , \nwhile for a F.D. gas each energy-value 8 can only
  appear once, \nif it appears at all. Hence one has the two cases \n\n. (B.E.) ^
  = 0,1,2,3,... \n\n(o) \n(F.D.) n. = 0,l. \n\nNow we apply the general laws of statistical
  equilibrium, which \nhave to be supplemented by the fundamental rule of quantum
  \nmechanics that each non-degenerate (simple) quantum state has \nthe same weight.
  (This is implied by the equation (9.14) of the \ntext which shows that the diagonal
  element of the density matrix \ndetermines the number of particles in the corresponding
  state.) \nAs we have seen in Appendix, 14, it suffices to calculate the \npartition
  function Z (14.24), p. 158, with all a) 8 = 1, \n\nZ= 2 e-t*to>** 9 (7) \n\n\n\n200

  describe a definite state of the system. These are just the \nnumbers introduced
  in (4), with or without the restriction (5) \naccording to the type of particle.
  Introducing the abbreviation \n\nz s = e-fc ' (8) \n\none has \n\nz= 2 ^5... = 2?
  I 24 t -\" = n2*- () \n\nni,n 2 ,... wi n* a n* \n\nThe sum is easily evaluated
  for the two cases (6), \n\n\n\n(F.D.) 2?- =l+v \n\na \n\nOne can conveniently combine
  the results into one expression \n\n\n\nwhere the upper sign refers throughout to
  the B.E.'case. \n\nThis formula contains the theory of radiation, where the \ncondition
  (5) does not apply. But it is more convenient to deal \nwith the instance where
  (5) holds and to relax this condition in \nthe final result. \n\nA glance at the
  original form (9) of Z shows that the condition \n(5) indicates the selection from
  (10) of those terms which are \nhomogeneous of order n in all the z s . \n\nThis
  can be done by the method of complex integration. We \nform the generating function
  \n\n/(O ' \n\n\n\nand expand it in powers of . The coefficient of n is obviously
  \nequal to the product (9) with the restriction (5). Hence we obtain \ninstead of
  (10) \n\n(12) \n\n\n\nwhere the path of integration surrounds the origin in such
  a way \nthat no other singularity is included except f = 0. \n\nFor large n this
  integral can be evaluated by the method of \nsteepest descent. It is easy to see
  that the integrand has one and \nonly one minimum on the real positive axis. \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX
  201 \n\nAs in previous cases (see Appendix, 14, 15) the crudest \napproximation
  suffices. One writes the integrand in the form \ne*, where ^ = _ (n+1)log + l og
  /(0, \n\nand determines the minimum of the function gr() from \n\n0; (13) \n\n\n\nthen
  one has to calculate g() and \n\n\n\nfor the value of which is the root of (13).
  To a first approxi- \nmation one finds \n\nz = -- \n\n\n\nlogZ = Mn+l)log+log/(0-llog{27j0'(0}.
  \n\nNeglecting 1 compared with n and the last term (which can \nbe seen to be of
  a smaller order), one obtains \n\nlogZ=-nlogM-log/(C); (14) \n\nhere is the root
  of (13), where also n-\\- 1 can be replaced by n. \nNow one gets from (11) \n\nlog/(0
  = \n\n\n\nHence, from (8) and (13), \n\n\n\nFrom this equation a (or f ) can be
  determined as function of \nthe particle number and of temperature. One easily sees
  now \nthat the case where the number of particles n is not given is \nobtained by
  just omitting the equation (16) and putting a = \nor ? = 1. Yet the equation (16)
  is not entirely meaningless now, \nit gives the changing number of particles actually
  present. \n\n\n\n202 APPENDIX \n\nThe mean number of particles of the kind s is
  obviously \n\n\n\n\"- \n\n\n\n__ 1 dZ ___ IdlogZ \n\n\n\n\nhence, from (14) and
  (15), \n\n\n\nwhich confirms (16) with (5). This formula, for thg B.E. case \n\n(minus
  sign), has been mentioned in VIII (8.20), where it was \n\nobtained by a completely
  different consideration of Einstein's. \n\nIn the same way, the average energy of
  the system is found to \n\n(18) \n\n\n\nin agreement with (4). \n\nThese are the
  fundamental formulae of quantum gases, derived \nfrom the general kinetic theory.
  They are to be found in A. Ph. \nCh. VII, p. 197; in particular the fundamental
  formula (17) in \n5, p. 224, for B.E., and in 6, p. 228, for F.D. All further \ndevelopments
  may be read there (or in any other of the \nmany books dealing with the subject).
  I wish to conclude this \npresentation by giving the explicit formulae for monatomic
  \ngases, where the energy is = jt> 2 /2m and the summation over \ncells is to be
  replaced by an integration over the momentum \nspace. The weight of a cell is found,
  by a simple quantum- \nmechanical consideration, for a single particle without spin
  \n(A. Ph. Ch. VII, 4, p. 215) to be \n\n1 \n\n\n\nHence, introducing the integration

  are the quantum generalizations of the formulae given in \nAppendix 14 and reduce
  to them for a -> oo. A detailed discus- \nsion would be outside the plan of this
  book. It need only be \nsaid that the F.D. statistics of electrons have been fully
  confirmed \nby the study -of the properties of metals (A. Ph. Ch. VII. 7, \np. 229;
  8, p. 232; 9, p. 235; 10, p. 236; A. XXX, p. 352). \n\n33. (IX. p. 116.) Quantum
  equations of motion \n\nAt the end of Chapter VI, which deals with the kinetic theory
  \nof (dense) matter from the classical standpoint, the statistical \nderivation
  of the phenomenological hydro-thermal equations \nwas mentioned and reference made
  to this later Appendix, which \nbelongs to quantum theory. This was done to save
  space; for \nthe classical derivation is essentially the same as that based on \nquantum
  theory, and one easily obtains it from the latter by a \nfew simple rules. \n\nThe
  first of these rules is, of course, the correspondence of the \n\nnormalized commutator
  [a, j3] = - (a/? /?a) with the Poisson \n\n* lib \n\nbracket 8? 8a 8$ \\ \n\n~ *

  .. = JJ dxWx<d'8(xM_x%.. (2) \n\nIt has to be interpreted classically to mean \n\nXa
  ... = JJdx(^<>.... (3) \n\nThus the classical operation f d| (fl) corresponds to
  \n\n\n\ni.e. to substituting x (fl) for x (c)/ as stated in the text. \n\nIn using
  the correspondence principle to proceed from classical \nto quantum mechanics a
  product aft may not be left unchanged \nunless a and j8 commute; in general one
  must replace aj8 by \n\n\n\nBy applying these rules one can easily go over from
  quantum \n\n\n\n204 APPENDIX \n\nto classical formulae (and in many cases also vice
  versa). There- \nfore we give here only the quantum treatment. \n\nTo derive the
  equation (9.48) from (9.46) with the help of \n(9.47), one proceeds by steps of
  which only the first need be \ngiven, as the following ones are precisely similar:
  One has: \n\nH N = tf w _ 1+ JLpWi+ JT tfW. . (4) \n\nHence, applying the operation
  XN ^ (9-46), one obtains, using \nXN PN = PN-V \n\n\n\nP W2 > ftr] + j \n\n\n\nThe
  middle term on the right-hand side is \n\n\n\n. PN]- \n(5) \n\n\n\nand vanishes
  on transformation to a surface integral, because \nthere is no flow across the boundary
  at a large distance. Hence \n(5) reduces to the equation (9.48) with q = NI, which
  com- \npletes the first step. The following steps are of the same pattern. \nIn
  order to make the transition from the 'microscopic' equa- \ntions of motion (9.48)
  of the molecular clusters to the macro- \nscopic equations of hydrodynamics, one
  needs first to define the \ndensity and macroscopic velocity in terms of the molecular
  \nquantities. The generalized 'density' n q , which reduces to the \nordinary number
  density % for q = 1, is obtained as a function \nof the positions x (1 >,..., x
  ( > by writing x (l '>' = x<*> (i = l,2,...,g) \nin the density matrix /> a (x,
  x'). The macroscopic velocity u^ \nfor a molecule (i) in the cluster of q molecules
  whose positions are \ngiven is the average value of the quantity represented by
  the \n\noperator p (i) : \n\nm i \n\n-* < \n\n\n\nwhere the bracket {...} indicates
  the symmetrized product, as \nintroduced above, and the subscript x' = x the diagonal
  \nelements of the matrix. \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX 205 \n\nBy expressing (9.48) in the coordinate

  phenomenological theory of supra- \nconductivity, mainly due to F. London; it is
  excellently pre- \nsented in a book by M. von Laue, where the literature can be
  \nfound. (Theorie der Supraleitung: Springer, Berlin u. GOttingen, \n1947). \n\nMany
  attempts to formulate an electronic theory have \nbeen made, without much success.
  Recently W. Heisenberg \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX 207 \n\nhas published some papers (Z. f.
  Naturforschung, 2 a, p. 185, \n1947) which claim to explain the essential features
  of the pheno- \nmenon. According to this theory every metal ought to be supra- \nconductive
  for sufficiently low temperatures. Actually the alkali \nmetals which liave one
  'free' electron are not supraconductive \neven at the lowest temperatures at present
  obtainable, and it is \nnot very likely that a further decrease of temperature will
  change \nthis. There are also theoretical objections against Heisenberg's \nmethod.
  % \n\nA different theory has been developed by my collaborator \nMr. Kai Chia Cheng
  and myself, which connects supracon- \nductivity with certain properties of the
  crystal lattice and pre- \ndicts correlations between structure and supraconductive
  state, \nwhich are confirmed by the facts (e.g. the behaviour of the alkali \nmetals).
  The complete theory will be worked out in due course. \n\n35. (X. p. 124.) Economy
  of thinking \n\nThe ideal of simplicity has found a materialistic expression in
  \nErnst Mach's principle of economy in thought (Prinzip der \nDenk-Okonomie). He
  maintains that the purpose of theory in \nscience is to economize our mental efforts.
  This formulation, \noften repeated by other authors, seems to me very objectionable.
  \nIf we want to economize thinking the best way would be to stop \nthinking at all.
  A minimum principle like this has, as is well \nknown to mathematicians, a meaning
  only if a constraining \ncondition is added. We must first agree that we are confronted
  \nwith the task not only of bringing some order into a vast expanse \nof accumulated
  experience but also of perpetually extending this \nexperience by*research; then
  we shall readily consent that we \nwould be lost without the utmost efficiency and
  clarity in think- \ning. To replace these words by the expression 'economy of \nthinking'
  may have an appeal to engineers and others interested \nin practical applications,
  but hardly to those who enjoy thinking \nfor no other purpose than to clarify a
  problem. \n\n36. (X. p. 127.) Concluding remarks \n\nI feel that any critical reference
  to philosophical literature \nought to be based on quotations. Yet, as I have said
  before, my \nreading of philosophical books is sporadic and unsystematic, \nand
  what I say here is a mere general impression. A book which \n\n\n\n208 APPENDIX
  \n\nI have recently read with some care is E. Cassirer's Determinis- \nmus und Indeterminismua
  in der modernen Physik (Gdteborg, \nElanders, 1937), which gives an excellent account
  of the situa- \ntion, not only in physics itself but also with regard to possible
  \napplications of the new physical ideas to other fields. There one \nfinds references
  to and quotations from all great thinkers who have \nwritten about the problem.
  The last section containsCassirer's \nopinion on the ethical consequences of physical
  indeterminism \nwhich is essentially the same as that expressed by myself. I \nquote
  his words (translated from p. 259): 'From the significance \nof freedom, as a mere
  possibility limited by natural laws, \nthere is no way to that \"reality\" of volition
  and freedom of \ndecision with which ethics is concerned. To mistake the choice
  \n(Auswahl) which an electron, according to Bohr's theory has \nbetween different
  quantum orbits, with a choice (Wahl) in \nthe ethical sense of this concept, would
  mean to become the \nvictim of a purely linguistic equivocality. To speak of an
  ethical \nchoice there must not only be different possibilities but a con- \nscious
  distinction between them and a conscious decision \nabout them. To attribute such
  acts to an electron would be a \ngross relapse into a form of anthropomorphism.
  . . . ' Concerning \nthe inverse problem whether the 'freedom' of the electron helps
  \nus to understand the freedom of volition he says this (p. 261): \n'It is of no
  avail whether causality in nature is regarded in \nthe form of rigorous \"dynamical\"
  laws or of merely statistical \nlaws. ... In neither way does there remain open
  an access to \nthat sphere of \"freedom\" which is claimed by ethics'. \n\nMy short
  survey of these difficult problems cannot be com- \npared with Cassirer's deep and
  thorough study. Yet it is a \nsatisfaction to me that he also sees the philosophical
  importance \nof quantum theory not so much in the question of indeterminism \nbut
  in the possibility of several complementary perspectives or \naspects in the description
  of the same phenomena as soon as \ndifferent standpoints of meaning are taken. There
  is no unique \nimage of our whole world of experience. \n\nThis last Appendix, added
  after delivering the lectures, gives \nme the opportunity to express my thanks to
  those among my \naudience who came to me to discuss problems and to raise \nobjections.
  One of these was directed against my expression \n\n\n\nAPPENDIX 209 \n\n'observational
  invariants'; it was said that the conception of \ninvariant presupposes the existence
  of a group of transformations \nwhich is lacking in this case. I do not think that
  this is right. \nThe problem is, of course, a psychological one; what I call \n'observational*
  in variants' corresponds roughly to the Gestalten \nof the psychologists. The essence
  of Oestalten theory is that the \nprimary perceptions consist not in uncoordinated
  sense im- \npressions but in total shapes or configurations which preserve \ntheir
  identity independently of their own movements and the \nchanging standpoint of the
  observer. Now compare this with \na mathematical example, say the definition of
  the group of \nrotations as those linear transformations of the coordinates \nx,y,
  z for which x 2 +y*+z 2 is invariant. The latter condition \ncan be interpreted
  geometrically as postulating the invariance \nof the shape of spheres. Hence the
  group is defined by assuming \nthe existence of a definite invariant configuration
  or Gestalt, not \nthe other way round. The situation in psychology seems to me \nquite
  analogous, though much less precise. Yet I think that this \nanalogy is of some
  help in understanding what we mean by real \nthings in the flow of perceptions.
  \n\nAnother objection was raised against my use of the expression \n'metaphysical'
  because of its association with speculative sys- \ntems of philosophy. I need hardly
  say that I do not like this kind \nof metaphysics, which pretends that there is
  a definite goal to be \nreached and often claims to have reached it. I am convinced
  \nthat we are on a never-ending way ; on a good and enjoyable way, \nbut far from
  any goal. Metaphysical systematization means \nformalization and petrification.
  Yet there are metaphysical \nproblems, 'which cannot be disposed of by declaring
  them \nmeaningless, or by calling them with other names, like epistemo- \nlogy.
  For, as I have repeatedly said, they are 'beyond physics' \nindeed and demand an
  act of faith. We have to accept this fact \nto be honest. There are two objectionable
  types of believers: \nthose who believe the incredible and those who believe that
  \n'belief must be discarded and replaced by 'the scientific method' . \nBetween
  these two extremes on the right and the left there is \nenough scope for believing
  the reasonable and reasoning on \nsound beliefs. Faith, imagination, and intuition
  are decisive \nfactors in the progress of science as in any other human activity.
