                  ANARCHISM
- "                \n"
- |2
                          General Principles.
- |2
                       Anarchism is a social philosophy and a political doctrine based on
- |2
                      the value of individual freedom. As such it is linked up with liberal and
- |2
                      all other kinds of progressive ideas. Essential for anarchist thought,
- |2
                      however, is the rejection of all coercive au-
- |2
                      thority exercised by men over men. The Greek wordan-archy must have meant absence of authority or071
- |2
                       government. The word “anarchy,” describing a
- |2
                          state- less society, was for the first
- |2
                      time used by Louis Armand de Lahontan in his Nouveaux
- |2
                          voyages dans l'Amérique septentrionale (1703),
- |2
                      describing the Indians living in a society without state, laws, prisons,
- |2
                      priests, private property, in short, “in anarchy.”
- |2
                      Colloquially however, anarchy became identical with confusion and disorder.
- |2
                  A wide diversity of anarchist views can be found in the works of
- |2
                      philosophers, religious thinkers, writers, and poets throughout the ages;
- |2
                      for example, in Diderot's “I don't wish either to give or to
- |2
                      obey laws,” we have a short and perfect statement of the
- |2
                      anarchist creed. Opposing Plato's “state communism,”
- |2
                      Zeno, the founder of the Stoa school, advocated a society without
- |2
                      government. Laws should be abolished, since virtue and morality could only
- |2
                      be achieved in liberty.
- |2
                  As a general principle, anarchism advocates a society from which the
- |2
                      coercive elements have been removed. Like anarchism, liberalism stemmed
- |2
                      from the concern for freedom, and the wish to keep the activities of
- |2
                      the state and the functions of government to a minimum. Anarchism,
- |2
                      however, holds that liberal postulates are realizable only on the basis of
- |2
                      the abolition of economic monopoly and the coercive institutions of
- |2
                      political power because, while equality is quite possible without
- |2
                      liberty, there can be no liberty without social and economic equality;
- |2
                      “liberty without socialism is privi-
- |2
                      lege, injustice; and socialism without liberty is slavery and
- |2
                      brutality” (Bakunin). The liberal view of the “min- imization” of the state and
- |2
                      its replacement by free federalist groups, was first expounded by Wilhelm
- |2
                      von Humboldt in his treatise, Ideen zu einem Versuch,
- |2
                          die Grenzen der Wirksamkeit des Staats zu bestimmen,
- |2
                      written in 1792 and published in 1851 (English trans.The Sphere and Duties of Government, 1854). John
- |2
                      Stuart Mill was influenced by this work in writing On
- |2
                          Liberty (1859). Both works exposed the danger in de- mocracy of the “tyranny of the
- |2
                      majority,” using prin- ciples very
- |2
                      close to anarchist doctrine.
- |2
                  Anarchism holds that there is no conflict or irrecon- cilability between the rights of the individual
- |2
                      and society. Sociologically anarchism is based on the dis- tinction between state and society. As
- |2
                      men continually are bound to work together for almost any purpose,
- |2
                      their aims will be achieved more efficiently if the guiding principle is
- |2
                      solidarity or “mutual aid.” The individual is not
- |2
                      only a single entity, but his very existence presupposes also a collective
- |2
                      relationship. Anarchism postulates that human potentialities, spon- taneity, individuality, and initiative,
- |2
                      buried in an au- thoritarian society and
- |2
                      in a network of bureaucratic institutions, can be freed by
- |2
                      de-institutionalizing soci- ety. Life-enhancing
- |2
                      processes of society will be liber- ated with
- |2
                      the passing of the domination of the state,
- |2
                       which is regarded as a tumor on the body politic. The state,
- |2
                      the supreme authority, with its machinery (the government) which carries
- |2
                      more power than is re- quired for
- |2
                      administration—i.e., the “political sur- plus”—should be abolished.
- |2
                  Education has always played an important part in anarchist doctrines. Modern
- |2
                      psychology and education, with its child-centered principle of
- |2
                      self-education and self-discipline, has distinctive anarchist implications
- |2
                      in this respect. In recent times new schools in criminology
- |2
                      (especially in the USA, and partly in England and the Netherlands) have
- |2
                      advocated a change of attitude in judging delinquents and in recognizing
- |2
                      their right to some forms of deviant behavior, and to being regarded
- |2
                      as equals instead of being made by authority to adapt to the actual
- |2
                      dominant pattern. The abolition of the punitive element in justice as well
- |2
                      as the abolition of prisons as “seminars of vice,”
- |2
                      “where man comes out worse than he enters” (William
- |2
                      Godwin), is gaining ground.
- |2
                  The essence of the artist as a creative individual implies absolute freedom
- |2
                      to realize his aesthetic aims, and suo ipso
- |2
                      anarchistic thought, even if he is not aware of its theoretical basis. In
- |2
                      our age, without abandoning its traditional aesthetic norms in art this
- |2
                      need for free- dom becomes even more evident.
- |2
                      Anarchism postulates that without coercion and stringent outside
- |2
                      regulations everyone would have greater possibilities to develop his
- |2
                      potential creative personality.
- "                \n"
- |2
                          Different Trends.
- |2
                       Although different trends— anarcho-communism,
- |2
                      individualism, collectivism, mu- tualism, and
- |2
                      all the intermediate programs—can be distinguished, all
- |2
                      anarchist schools of thought have a fundamental conception in common, viz.,
- |2
                      freedom of the individual, rejection of government, state, and all
- |2
                      coercive institutions. These forms of anarchism are simply the ways
- |2
                      considered best for achieving freedom and solidarity in economic life, the
- |2
                      ways believed to correspond most closely with justice and freedom for
- |2
                      the distribution of the means of production and the products of labor among
- |2
                      men. It is the constant searching for a more secure guarantee of
- |2
                      freedom which is the common factor amongst anarchists even when
- |2
                      divided into different schools. “The achievement of the greatest
- |2
                      measures of individualism is in direct ratio to the amount of communism
- |2
                      that is possible; that is to say, a maximum of solidarity in order to
- |2
                      enjoy a maximum of freedom” (Malatesta [1926], p. 82).
- |2
                  Bakunist anarchism was called in the late 1860's
- |2
                      “collectivism.” Anarcho-communism, rejecting the ex- treme of individualist anarchism, as a
- |2
                      variation of collectivism laid the emphasis on communist distribu- tion and local and communal
- |2
                      association. Developed mainly by Kropotkin since the end of the seventies,072
- |2
                       this communal form became the dominating trend of anarchism in
- |2
                      the following decades. The anarcho-
- |2
                          communists who regarded trade unions as instruments in the
- |2
                      struggle for the economic and social improve-
- |2
                      ment of the working class within the framework of existing society
- |2
                      and as the means to carry out revolu- tion
- |2
                      and social reconstruction, called themselves anarcho-syndicalists. The
- |2
                      ultimate goal of anarcho-
- |2
                      syndicalism, identical with that of collective anarchism, is to
- |2
                      raise the masses to independent management of production and distribution
- |2
                      by the common action of all manual and intellectual working men of
- |2
                      every branch in industry.
- |2
                  Violence is not an essential part of anarchism. Nei-
- |2
                          ther is terrorism. Because of the spectacular attentats and outrages, connected with the names of
- |2
                      Ravachol, Auguste Vaillant, Emil Henry, Santo Caserio, mainly in
- |2
                      France (1891-94), and of later syndicalist bombings, anarchism and
- |2
                      terrorism became associated in the public mind. Their acts were usually
- |2
                      retaliation for the persecution and repression by the government and
- |2
                      they did not believe in any social organization by the work- ing class, or in propaganda, and acted in a state of
- |2
                      rebellion against society. However, their acts of rebel- lion were isolated, and the number of anarchists
- |2
                      who took part in them was always very small. Most of the terrorists in
- |2
                      modern times were not anarchists.

                  Some anarchist currents, like Christian and Tolstoyan anarchism, reject all
- |2
                      violence. Central to Leo Tolstoy's religious anarchism, derived from the
- |2
                      Scriptures, is the rejection of the state and of all authority exercised
- |2
                      by men over men, the denial of property, and the need for moral
- |2
                      revolution by persuasion and example, as well as by experiments of communal
- |2
                      living. Men should destroy the state by ceasing to cooperate with it,
- |2
                      and by forming new social organizations and patterns of behavior.
- |2
                      Refusal to obey, an essential principle of Tolstoy's teaching, influenced
- |2
                      Gandhi in his principle of nonviolent noncooperation. Gandhi was inspired
- |2
                      also by Henry David Thoreau's treatise On the Duty
- |2
                          of Civil Disobedience (1849). These ideas of individual
- |2
                      resistance can be summarized in the words of Étienne de la
- |2
                      Boétie: “Resolve no longer to serve and you will be
- |2
                      free.” Anselme Bellegarrique would write (1850):
- |2
                      “There are no tyrants, there are only slaves.” Non- cooperation, nonretaliation,
- |2
                      nonviolent resistance, war resistance, boycott, and direct action are
- |2
                      applications all derived from these principles.

                          Political Doctrine.
- |2
                       Anarchist thought exercised its main influence as a political
- |2
                      doctrine. As such it is part of the history of socialist thought, of which
- |2
                      it represents the libertarian and anti-Jacobin trend. Like socialism,
- |2
                      anarchism is a product of the political and industrial revolutions. As a
- |2
                      matter of fact the history of modern
- |2
                       anarchist thought and anarchist movement is bound up since the
- |2
                      middle of the nineteenth century with the history of the labor movement. It
- |2
                      is strongly in- fluenced by Marxist ideas
- |2
                      about the class struggle and the emphasis of the economic side of the
- |2
                      emancipation of the laboring classes.
- |2
                  Anarchism—in contrast with Marxian theory— rejects the
- |2
                      theory of the political organization of the labor class with a view to the
- |2
                      conquest of the state. It rejects pressure through the mechanism of parlia- mentary parties as well as
- |2
                      dictatorship in the period of the revolution as instruments to achieve
- |2
                      these ends. It objects to representative government and to parlia- mentary democracy because it denies
- |2
                      that in a political sense one man should represent another, unless he
- |2
                      is a delegate to represent a group in relation to a definite issue or
- |2
                      form of activity, and is always subject to recall.
- |2
                  Marx, and Engels too, defined anarchy as the final stage of socialism, i.e.,
- |2
                      a classless and stateless society. Anarchism however regards the Marxian
- |2
                      theory of the inevitability of the historical economic process,
- |2
                      leading to the conquest of power and subsequently the
- |2
                      “withering away of the state” as a fallacy and as uto- pian dialectics.
- |2
                  Anarchism recognizes only regional differences and demands for every group
- |2
                      the right of self-deter- mination in
- |2
                      solidarity with all other associations of an economic or territorial order.
- |2
                      Federalism is an essen- tial part of its
- |2
                      doctrine. In place of the present state organization, anarchism would
- |2
                      establish a federation of free communities which would be bound to one
- |2
                      another by their common and social interests, and would arrange their
- |2
                      affairs by mutual agreement and free contract.

                       The first systematic exposition is the po-
- |2
                          litical treatise of William Godwin, An Enquiry
- |2
                              con- cerning Political Justice and
- |2
                          its Influence on General Virtue and Happiness (1793). The title is
- |2
                      a good sum- mary of the content. The main claim
- |2
                      of Godwin as founder of modern anarchism is that in Godwin's opin- ion all moral evils are caused by political
- |2
                      institutions. A disciple of eighteenth-century philosophical ration- alism and belief in the perfectibility
- |2
                      of man, i.e., a continuous advance towards higher rationality, Godwin
- |2
                      believed that men behaved irrationally because the conventional
- |2
                      institutions of society led them to stray from reason. Man's character
- |2
                      depends on external cir- cumstances, and
- |2
                      social prejudice and government should be abolished, as government
- |2
                      constitutes the frequent source of crime, villainy, and injustice.
- |2
                      Godwin questioned the legitimacy of every form of government and coercion,
- |2
                      and envisaged a future of free enlightened cooperation of individuals,
- |2
                      grouped in small communities.

- |2
                  The importance Godwin attached to education, i.e., to the purpose of
- |2
                      developing the child's autonomy, is common to most anarchist schools of
- |2
                      thought. The emphasis on the influence of environment in the for- mation of character and in the shaping of
- |2
                      human con- duct, was to be taken over by Robert
- |2
                      Owen and de- veloped as an integral part of
- |2
                      Owenite socialism. Godwin's anarchism rested on an absolute exaltation
- |2
                      of the claim of individual conscience enlightened by reason, involving a
- |2
                      repudiation of any duty of obedi- ence, save
- |2
                      to the demands of reason. Through Shelley, who adopted his philosophy and
- |2
                      who wrote to Godwin: “You are the regulator and former of my
- |2
                      mind,” an- archism became a theme
- |2
                      of world literature.
- |2
                  If Godwin tried to persuade, Charles Fourier empha-
- |2
                          sized the example of small communities (phalanstères), free and voluntary associations (communes socié-
- |2
                          taires), mainly agricultural, without any authority
- |2
                      and coercion, and with a variety of types of work suited for every
- |2
                      person, corresponding to the natural variety of human desires. He analyzed
- |2
                      the psychological con- ditions of work, and
- |2
                      believed he had discovered the law of “attraction,” a
- |2
                      permanent contribution to the problem of work and of the incentives and
- |2
                      their rela- tions to it. Free experiments are
- |2
                      an essential part of anti-authoritarian socialism.

                  William Thompson, influenced by Godwin, Ben-
- |2
                      tham, and Owen, advocated direct action by the pro- ducers, using trade unionism as a means for their own
- |2
                      emancipation without the help of the government. He devised a constructive
- |2
                      plan for the emancipation of labor by establishing cooperative societies of
- |2
                          produc- tion and thus constructing a new

                  Nineteenth-century anarchism first received form and content from
- |2
                      Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. The use of the words
- |2
                      “anarchy” and “anarchist” in the
- |2
                      nineteenth century goes back to Proudhon, who used
- |2
                      “anarchy” for the first time in the sense of absence
- |2
                      of sovereignty (What is Property?, 1840). Later
- |2
                      Proudhon spoke, in his Solution du problème
- |2
                          social, of the ideal republic as a positive
- |2
                          anarchy. “It is neither liberty, subordi- nated to order, as in a constitutional monarchy,
- |2
                      nor liberty in presenting order. It is reciprocal liberty and not
- |2
                      limited liberty; liberty is not the daughter but the
- |2
                       mother of order” (Cole, I, 202). Proudhon's
- |2
                      influence on subsequent anarchist thought has been threefold: (1) his
- |2
                      attack on the Jacobin principle, his denunciation of the State, and his
- |2
                      rejection of representative democ- racy; (2)
- |2
                      his proposal to replace the State by groups of individuals, united for
- |2
                      productive purposes; (3) his theory of federalism. According to Proudhon,
- |2
                      economic and social exploitation was correlated with political
- |2
                      oppression. Nothing is feasible by spontaneous initi- ative, independent actions of individuals and collectiv- ities as long as they are in the
- |2
                      presence of this colossal power which is given to the State by
- |2
                      centralization. Proudhon rejected a state corporation as advocated by
- |2
                      Louis Blanc. Although he thought mainly in terms of small-scale economic
- |2
                      activity, he envisaged for the future large industry and agriculture
- |2
                      developed from association. Proudhon advocated a great central Credit
- |2
                      Bank, an independent institution apart from the State, making through
- |2
                      subsidiary branches interest-free ad- vances of
- |2
                      capital, to ensure means of labor to each producer, or workers'
- |2
                      organizations to ensure to each producer the full product of his labor.
- |2
                      Products would be exchanged at cost value by means of labor checks
- |2
                      based on the labor-time theory of value associated with Robert Owen and the
- |2
                      Ricardian socialists. Proudhon called this system
- |2
                      “mutualism.”
- |2
                  Two outstanding representatives of anarchist indi-
- |2
                          vidualism are Max Stirner and Benjamin Tucker. InDer Einzige und sein Eigenthum (1844; trans. as
- |2
                          The Ego and his Own), Stirner, a philosopher and
- |2
                      a social and political thinker, developed the view that law and the
- |2
                      State deprived the individual of his uniqueness. As all forms of government
- |2
                      arise from the principle that all right and all authority belong to the
- |2
                      collectivity, it is indifferent who exercises the authority, for the
- |2
                      collectivity is always above the individual. The State acts with violence
- |2
                      and claims that its laws are sacred. He who affronts them is a criminal.
- |2
                      Every man's wel- fare demands that a social life
- |2
                      based solely on the welfare of the individual take the place of the
- |2
                      State. The State exists through voluntary servitude. What do laws
- |2
                      amount to if no one obeys them? What do orders amount to if nobody lets
- |2
                      himself be ordered? The State is not imaginable without rulers and
- |2
                      servitude; for the State must will to be the lord of all that it
- |2
                      embraces, and this will is called the “will of the
- |2
                      State.” The workers have the most enormous power in their
- |2
                      hands and if they once became thoroughly conscious of it and used it,
- |2
                      nothing would withstand them. The State rests on the slavery of labor. If
- |2
                      labor becomes free, the State is lost.
- |2
                  Benjamin R. Tucker rejected any communistic solu-
- |2
                      tion of the social problem as incompatible with the
- |2
                      “sovereignty of the individual,” as postulated by the074
- |2
                       first American exponents of individual anarchism such as Josiah
- |2
                      Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews. Their intellectual development was not
- |2
                      influenced by European libertarian or radical ideas, but rooted in the
- |2
                      liberal principles of the Declaration of Independence. In the first half of
- |2
                      the nineteenth century, American “philosophical
- |2
                      anarchism” was a product of the social conditions of the
- |2
                      country. There was a belief in the effectiveness of practical experiments,
- |2
                      and their social and economic ideas were based on the right to full
- |2
                      product of one's labor, an equitable commerce on the basis of cost as the
- |2
                      limit of price, i.e., similar to what Proudhon had conceived in his
- |2
                      “mutualist” ideas.
- |2
                  Michael Bakunin, a prolific but incoherent writer, developed his anarchist
- |2
                      ideas from 1864 on. Starting from Hegel's idealism, Bakunin's philosophical
- |2
                      ideas were molded by the humanism of Ludwig Feuerbach. Atheism became
- |2
                      an essential part of his doctrine. He regarded the idea of God as
- |2
                      fundamentally inconsistent with human freedom. With Bakunin, anarchist
- |2
                      thought became linked with anarchist organizations and working-class
- |2
                      movements, and became a political movement. His doctrine inspired socialist
- |2
                      movements in France, Italy, Switzerland, and in Spain, where its
- |2
                      influence lasted longest. Like Proudhon, Bakunin at-
- |2
                          tacked the concept of the centralized state even when it
- |2
                      appeared as the democratic representation of the people or as the
- |2
                      instrument of a hitherto exploited class. He envisaged a revolution to
- |2
                      expropriate capital and land, but not by the state, which to be able
- |2
                      to fulfil its political and economic mission (as state- socialists advocate) would
- |2
                      necessarily have to be very powerful and strongly concentrated. He foresaw
- |2
                      even greater exploitation, and in the development of the modern great
- |2
                      powers and in the growing influence of economic monopoly, the greatest
- |2
                      danger for the future of Europe.
- |2
                  Bakunin's anarchist ideas are most fully expressed in the
- |2
                      programs—mostly drafts—which he wrote for the secret
- |2
                      societies he tried to organize. He was con-
- |2
                      vinced that a small number of individuals, acting in common with the
- |2
                      masses, could and should essentially influence the course of historic
- |2
                      events. Bakunin's social theory is a critical application of anarchism with

                      a view to changing the political and social system. He rejected
- |2
                      Proudhon's mutualism as a solution of the social prob-
- |2
                          lem, and also the belief in the possibility of eliminating
- |2
                      capitalism by peaceful means. However, Proudhon's anti-Jacobin and
- |2
                      federalist ideas influenced him, but he rejected every form of state
- |2
                      socialism:
- "                \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          I detest communism because it is the negation of liberty and I can
- |2
                              conceive nothing human without liberty. I am no communist because
- |2
                              communism concentrates and aims at the absorption of all powers of
- |2
                              society; the radical extir

                              pation of that principle of authority and guardianship
- |2
                              of the state which under the pretext of moralizing and civi- lizing men, has hitherto

                              enslaved, oppressed, exploited and depraved them

                  He stood for the organization of society arranged from below upward on the
- |2
                      basis of collective and social property, by way of free association.
- |2
                  Bakunin, the great antagonist of Marx in the “First
- |2
                      International” (1864), not only objected to the theory of the
- |2
                      state and dictatorship but regarded the Marxian interpretation of Hegel's
- |2
                      dialectic, that socialism would be the result of an inevitable,
- |2
                      historically determined, scientific process, as a fallacy. He was very
- |2
                      critical of the prospect that science would regulate human and social
- |2
                      affairs, “the reign of scientific intelligence would be a
- |2
                      despotism, more demoralizing and worse than any previous despotism, and
- |2
                      resulting in a new class, a hierarchy of real and fictitious scientists,
- |2
                      and the world would be divided between a minority in the name of
- |2
                      science and an immense ignorant majority” (Archives Bakounine, II, 204).
- |2
                  Peter Kropotkin, scientist, historian, and social re-
- |2
                          former, contributed perhaps more then anyone else to the
- |2
                      elaboration and propagation of anarchism. In his classic, anti-Darwinist,
- |2
                      sociological work Mutual Aid: a Factor of Evolution
- |2
                      (1902) he sets out to show that mutual aid is as important an aspect in
- |2
                      nature and in society as the struggle for survival. The dominating
- |2
                      importance of the principle of mutual aid appears also in the domain of
- |2
                      ethics. Konrad Lorenz wrote that mutual aid is the only phylogenetical
- |2
                      adapted mecha- nism of behavior. By combining
- |2
                      his scientific and social aspirations, Kropotkin tried to find a scientific
- |2
                      basis of anarchism but never found a very convincing one. The very
- |2
                      basis of his faith is a belief in cooperativeness as a natural human
- |2
                      quality. The process of individ-
- |2
                      ualization, or “individuation” as modern
- |2
                      psychologists would call it, i.e., self-realization, will not lead to
- |2
                      isolation, but to an intense and more universal col-
- |2
                          lective solidarity. He believed in the coordination of industry
- |2
                      and agriculture; small communities which would control the means of
- |2
                      production and counteract the tendency of centralized mass production. He
- |2
                          al- ways stressed the importance of the
- |2
                      institutes created by the workers themselves as cooperative societies
- |2
                      and trade unions. After the Russian Revolution he stated (1919) that
- |2
                      as long as the country was governed by a party dictatorship, the workers'
- |2
                      and peasant councils lost their entire significance.
- |2
                  Errico Malatesta, who spent a life of incessant revo- lutionary activity spreading anarchist propaganda in
- |2
                      Europe and in America, was, like Kropotkin, an anarcho-communist. But while
- |2
                      Kropotkin stressed the075
- |2
                       importance of free association, Malatesta emphasized the role
- |2
                      of the conscious minority and of revolutionary actions. Malatesta started
- |2
                      his anarchist career in the 1870's as a follower of Bakunin, but in later
- |2
                      years he thought the economic and historical approach of Bakunin too
- |2
                      Marxist. Although no opponent of syndi-
- |2
                      calism, he did not share with the anarcho-syndicalists their belief
- |2
                      that creating a mass movement through the trade unions was an essential,
- |2
                      constructive element in the revolution. He accepted the syndicalist
- |2
                      theory of the general strike insofar as it was insurrectional and
- |2
                      expropriative, in fact, insofar as it was an effective means of social
- |2
                      transformation. He did not share Kropotkin's optimism, or his scientific
- |2
                      interpretation of anarchism. He was a pragmatic anarchist and held
- |2
                      that the mean task of anarchists was to make and to help to make the
- |2
                      revolution. He advanced the revolu- tion as
- |2
                      much as possible in his constructive as well as destructive roles, always
- |2
                      opposing the formation of any government. He also held that abolition of
- |2
                      political power without the simultaneous destruction of eco- nomic privilege was not possible. He shared
- |2
                      these views with Bakunin, including the rejection of terror. In
- |2
                      revolution one must attack institutions; then it will not be necessary to
- |2
                      destroy people, and to foster the inevitable reaction which is always
- |2
                      caused by the mas- sacre of men.
- |2
                      “Terror,” wrote Malatesta, “has always
- |2
                      been the instrument of tyranny.”
- |2
                  The Russian Revolution developed initially on Bakuninist lines: the state
- |2
                      and its institutions were destroyed and replaced by
- |2
                      “soviets,” i.e., councils of workers and peasants,
- |2
                      who expropriated the factories and the land. These soviets, in which the
- |2
                      constructive element of the revolution was embodied, disintegrated
- |2
                      after the Bolsheviks had succeeded in founding a “rev- olutionary state” and a
- |2
                      party dictatorship. The liqui- dation by the
- |2
                      Red Army (March 1921) of the Commune of Kronstadt, which stood for
- |2
                      “all power to the Soviets and not to the Party,”
- |2
                      marked the end of the inde- pendent soviets.
- |2
                  The most important historical example of an attempt to put anarchist
- |2
                      principles into practice was the in- dustrial
- |2
                      and agricultural “collectivizations” during the first
- |2
                      months of the Spanish Civil War. Within forty-
- |2
                          eight hours of the uprising, on July 19, 1936, the whole
- |2
                      economic and social life of Catalonia and many other parts of Spain was
- |2
                      taken over by the syndicates. Fac- tories,
- |2
                      railways, and workshops, as well as all social services, were run by
- |2
                      workers' councils. The continu- ation of
- |2
                      the armed struggle, the government control of production and finance, the
- |2
                      counterrevolutionary policy of the communists after the Stalin
- |2
                      intervention, the compromises made in the name of “victory
- |2
                      over Franco,” e.g., the participation of the anarchists'
- |2
                       leaders in the government, were all factors tending to
- |2
                      undermine this kind of social reconstruction.
- |2
                  In order to define the role played by anarchism in the light of the
- |2
                      experience of a rapidly changing soci- ety, two
- |2
                      different tendencies can be noticed. Since the defeat of the powerful
- |2
                      anarchist movement in the Spanish Civil War, anarchist movements
- |2
                      everywhere have declined and lost their impetus. But anarchist ideas
- |2
                      have outlived their partisans and may still be of value as doctrines of
- |2
                      social reconstruction. The state has changed its character. The
- |2
                      laissez-faire state of the nineteenth century has developed into an ever
- |2
                          in- creasing bureaucracy. In a growing
- |2
                      process powerful political institutions and industrial monopolies are in- tertwined in an excessively centralized
- |2
                      structure not dreamed of by any anarchist thinker.
- |2
                  The anarchist criticism of the state and of authority, far from being
- |2
                      invalidated by this modern develop- ment,
- |2
                      may be more relevant than when the theory was created. This may explain the
- |2
                      growing interest in the 1960's in anarchist ideas. Kropotkin's ideal of a
- |2
                          region- ally decentralized economy could
- |2
                      be regarded at the time as rather utopian and irreconcilable with the
- |2
                      economic and political trend of society. But the new developments in an age
- |2
                      of cybernetic potentially un- limited
- |2
                      technology could easily free society of work and want, to live in a world
- |2
                      of plenty. The use of new sources of power may reduce the necessity of
- |2
                          present- day, gigantic economic units,
- |2
                      and may make the widest distribution of industry, agriculture, and culture
- |2
                          possi- ble in the political as well as in
- |2
                      the social field. This however would not guarantee automatically a de- creased authority, as new communications and
- |2
                          com- puter techniques could just as well
- |2
                      produce a greater development of authority. In other words, such a
- |2
                      trend to decentralization would only be realized if based on an
- |2
                      interregional federation, in which the region, as defined by Lewis Mumford,
- |2
                      is the basic configuration in human life, a permanent sphere of cultural
- |2
                      influence, and a center of economic activity.

- |2
                       Anarchism is a social philosophy and a political doctrine based on
- |2
                      the value of individual freedom. As such it is linked up with liberal and
- |2
                      all other kinds of progressive ideas. Essential for anarchist thought,
- |2
                      however, is the rejection of all coercive au-
- |2
                      thority exercised by men over men. The Greek wordan-archy must have meant absence of authority orA wide diversity of anarchist views can be found in the works of
- |2
                      philosophers, religious thinkers, writers, and poets throughout the ages;
- |2
                      for example, in Diderot's “I don't wish either to give or to
- |2
                      obey laws,” we have a short and perfect statement of the
- |2
                      anarchist creed. Opposing Plato's “state communism,”
- |2
                      Zeno, the founder of the Stoa school, advocated a society without
- |2
                      government. Laws should be abolished, since virtue and morality could only
- |2
                      be achieved in liberty.As a general principle, anarchism advocates a society from which the
- |2
                      coercive elements have been removed. Like anarchism, liberalism stemmed
- |2
                      from the concern for freedom, and the wish to keep the activities of
- |2
                      the state and the functions of government to a minimum. Anarchism,
- |2
                      however, holds that liberal postulates are realizable only on the basis of
- |2
                      the abolition of economic monopoly and the coercive institutions of
- |2
                      political power because, while equality is quite possible without
- |2
                      liberty, there can be no liberty without social and economic equality;
- |2
                      “liberty without socialism is privi-
- |2
                      lege, injustice; and socialism without liberty is slavery and
- |2
                      brutality” (Bakunin). The liberal view of the “min- imization” of the state and
- |2
                      its replacement by free federalist groups, was first expounded by Wilhelm
- |2
                      von Humboldt in his treatise, Ideen zu einem Versuch,
- |2
                          die Grenzen der Wirksamkeit des Staats zu bestimmen,
- |2
                      written in 1792 and published in 1851 (English trans.The Sphere and Duties of Government, 1854). John
- |2
                      Stuart Mill was influenced by this work in writing On
- |2
                          Liberty (1859). Both works exposed the danger in de- mocracy of the “tyranny of the
- |2
                      majority,” using prin- ciples very
- |2
                      close to anarchist doctrine.Anarchism holds that there is no conflict or irrecon- cilability between the rights of the individual
- |2
                      and society. Sociologically anarchism is based on the dis- tinction between state and society. As
- |2
                      men continually are bound to work together for almost any purpose,
- |2
                      their aims will be achieved more efficiently if the guiding principle is
- |2
                      solidarity or “mutual aid.” The individual is not
- |2
                      only a single entity, but his very existence presupposes also a collective
- |2
                      relationship. Anarchism postulates that human potentialities, spon- taneity, individuality, and initiative,
- |2
                      buried in an au- thoritarian society and
- |2
                      in a network of bureaucratic institutions, can be freed by
- |2
                      de-institutionalizing soci- ety. Life-enhancing
- |2
                      processes of society will be liber- ated with
- |2
                      the passing of the domination of the state,
- |2
                       which is regarded as a tumor on the body politic. The state,
- |2
                      the supreme authority, with its machinery (the government) which carries
- |2
                      more power than is re- quired for
- |2
                      administration—i.e., the “political sur- plus”—should be abolished.Education has always played an important part in anarchist doctrines. Modern
- |2
                      psychology and education, with its child-centered principle of
- |2
                      self-education and self-discipline, has distinctive anarchist implications
- |2
                      in this respect. In recent times new schools in criminology
- |2
                      (especially in the USA, and partly in England and the Netherlands) have
- |2
                      advocated a change of attitude in judging delinquents and in recognizing
- |2
                      their right to some forms of deviant behavior, and to being regarded
- |2
                      as equals instead of being made by authority to adapt to the actual
- |2
                      dominant pattern. The abolition of the punitive element in justice as well
- |2
                      as the abolition of prisons as “seminars of vice,”
- |2
                      “where man comes out worse than he enters” (William
- |2
                      Godwin), is gaining ground.The essence of the artist as a creative individual implies absolute freedom
- |2
                      to realize his aesthetic aims, and suo ipso
- |2
                      anarchistic thought, even if he is not aware of its theoretical basis. In
- |2
                      our age, without abandoning its traditional aesthetic norms in art this
- |2
                      need for free- dom becomes even more evident.
- |2
                      Anarchism postulates that without coercion and stringent outside
- |2
                      regulations everyone would have greater possibilities to develop his
- |2
                      potential creative personality.
- |2
                          Different Trends.
- |2
                       Although different trends— anarcho-communism,
- |2
                      individualism, collectivism, mu- tualism, and
- |2
                      all the intermediate programs—can be distinguished, all
- |2
                      anarchist schools of thought have a fundamental conception in common, viz.,
- |2
                      freedom of the individual, rejection of government, state, and all
- |2
                      coercive institutions. These forms of anarchism are simply the ways
- |2
                      considered best for achieving freedom and solidarity in economic life, the
- |2
                      ways believed to correspond most closely with justice and freedom for
- |2
                      the distribution of the means of production and the products of labor among
- |2
                      men. It is the constant searching for a more secure guarantee of
- |2
                      freedom which is the common factor amongst anarchists even when
- |2
                      divided into different schools. “The achievement of the greatest
- |2
                      measures of individualism is in direct ratio to the amount of communism
- |2
                      that is possible; that is to say, a maximum of solidarity in order to
- |2
                      enjoy a maximum of freedom” (Malatesta [1926], p. 82).Bakunist anarchism was called in the late 1860's
- |2
                      “collectivism.” Anarcho-communism, rejecting the ex- treme of individualist anarchism, as a
- |2
                      variation of collectivism laid the emphasis on communist distribu- tion and local and communal
- |2
                      association. Developed mainly by Kropotkin since the end of the seventies,Violence is not an essential part of anarchism. Nei-
- |2
                          ther is terrorism. Because of the spectacular attentats and outrages, connected with the names of
- |2
                      Ravachol, Auguste Vaillant, Emil Henry, Santo Caserio, mainly in
- |2
                      France (1891-94), and of later syndicalist bombings, anarchism and
- |2
                      terrorism became associated in the public mind. Their acts were usually
- |2
                      retaliation for the persecution and repression by the government and
- |2
                      they did not believe in any social organization by the work- ing class, or in propaganda, and acted in a state of
- |2
                      rebellion against society. However, their acts of rebel- lion were isolated, and the number of anarchists
- |2
                      who took part in them was always very small. Most of the terrorists in
- |2
                      modern times were not anarchists.Some anarchist currents, like Christian and Tolstoyan anarchism, reject all
- |2
                      violence. Central to Leo Tolstoy's religious anarchism, derived from the
- |2
                      Scriptures, is the rejection of the state and of all authority exercised
- |2
                      by men over men, the denial of property, and the need for moral
- |2
                      revolution by persuasion and example, as well as by experiments of communal
- |2
                      living. Men should destroy the state by ceasing to cooperate with it,
- |2
                      and by forming new social organizations and patterns of behavior.
- |2
                      Refusal to obey, an essential principle of Tolstoy's teaching, influenced
- |2
                      Gandhi in his principle of nonviolent noncooperation. Gandhi was inspired
- |2
                      also by Henry David Thoreau's treatise On the Duty
- |2
                          of Civil Disobedience (1849). These ideas of individual
- |2
                      resistance can be summarized in the words of Étienne de la
- |2
                      Boétie: “Resolve no longer to serve and you will be
- |2
                      free.” Anselme Bellegarrique would write (1850):
- |2
                      “There are no tyrants, there are only slaves.” Non- cooperation, nonretaliation,
- |2
                      nonviolent resistance, war resistance, boycott, and direct action are
- |2
                      applications all derived from these principles.
- |2
                          Political Doctrine.
- |2
                       Anarchist thought exercised its main influence as a political
- |2
                      doctrine. As such it is part of the history of socialist thought, of which
- |2
                      it represents the libertarian and anti-Jacobin trend. Like socialism,
- |2
                      anarchism is a product of the political and industrial revolutions. As a
- |2
                      matter of fact the history of modern
- |2
                       anarchist thought and anarchist movement is bound up since the
- |2
                      middle of the nineteenth century with the history of the labor movement. It
- |2
                      is strongly in- fluenced by Marxist ideas
- |2
                      about the class struggle and the emphasis of the economic side of the
- |2
                      emancipation of the laboring classes.Anarchism—in contrast with Marxian theory— rejects the
- |2
                      theory of the political organization of the labor class with a view to the
- |2
                      conquest of the state. It rejects pressure through the mechanism of parlia- mentary parties as well as
- |2
                      dictatorship in the period of the revolution as instruments to achieve
- |2
                      these ends. It objects to representative government and to parlia- mentary democracy because it denies
- |2
                      that in a political sense one man should represent another, unless he
- |2
                      is a delegate to represent a group in relation to a definite issue or
- |2
                      form of activity, and is always subject to recall.Marx, and Engels too, defined anarchy as the final stage of socialism, i.e.,
- |2
                      a classless and stateless society. Anarchism however regards the Marxian
- |2
                      theory of the inevitability of the historical economic process,
- |2
                      leading to the conquest of power and subsequently the
- |2
                      “withering away of the state” as a fallacy and as uto- pian dialectics.Anarchism recognizes only regional differences and demands for every group
- |2
                      the right of self-deter- mination in
- |2
                      solidarity with all other associations of an economic or territorial order.
- |2
                      Federalism is an essen- tial part of its
- |2
                      doctrine. In place of the present state organization, anarchism would
- |2
                      establish a federation of free communities which would be bound to one
- |2
                      another by their common and social interests, and would arrange their
- |2
                      affairs by mutual agreement and free contract.
- |2
                          Theorists.
- |2
                       The first systematic exposition is the po-
- |2
                          litical treatise of William Godwin, An Enquiry
- |2
                              con- cerning Political Justice and
- |2
                          its Influence on General Virtue and Happiness (1793). The title is
- |2
                      a good sum- mary of the content. The main claim
- |2
                      of Godwin as founder of modern anarchism is that in Godwin's opin- ion all moral evils are caused by political
- |2
                      institutions. A disciple of eighteenth-century philosophical ration- alism and belief in the perfectibility
- |2
                      of man, i.e., a continuous advance towards higher rationality, Godwin
- |2
                      believed that men behaved irrationally because the conventional
- |2
                      institutions of society led them to stray from reason. Man's character
- |2
                      depends on external cir- cumstances, and
- |2
                      social prejudice and government should be abolished, as government
- |2
                      constitutes the frequent source of crime, villainy, and injustice.
- |2
                      Godwin questioned the legitimacy of every form of government and coercion,
- |2
                      and envisaged a future of free enlightened cooperation of individuals,
- |2
                      grouped in small communities.The importance Godwin attached to education, i.e., to the purpose of
- |2
                      developing the child's autonomy, is common to most anarchist schools of
- |2
                      thought. The emphasis on the influence of environment in the for- mation of character and in the shaping of
- |2
                      human con- duct, was to be taken over by Robert
- |2
                      Owen and de- veloped as an integral part of
- |2
                      Owenite socialism. Godwin's anarchism rested on an absolute exaltation
- |2
                      of the claim of individual conscience enlightened by reason, involving a
- |2
                      repudiation of any duty of obedi- ence, save
- |2
                      to the demands of reason. Through Shelley, who adopted his philosophy and
- |2
                      who wrote to Godwin: “You are the regulator and former of my
- |2
                      mind,” an- archism became a theme
- |2
                      of world literature.If Godwin tried to persuade, Charles Fourier empha-
- |2
                          sized the example of small communities (phalanstères), free and voluntary associations (communes socié-
- |2
                          taires), mainly agricultural, without any authority
- |2
                      and coercion, and with a variety of types of work suited for every
- |2
                      person, corresponding to the natural variety of human desires. He analyzed
- |2
                      the psychological con- ditions of work, and
- |2
                      believed he had discovered the law of “attraction,” a

- |2
                      an essential part of anti-authoritarian socialism.William Thompson, influenced by Godwin, Ben-
- |2
                      tham, and Owen, advocated direct action by the pro- ducers, using trade unionism as a means for their own
- |2
                      emancipation without the help of the government. He devised a constructive
- |2
                      plan for the emancipation of labor by establishing cooperative societies of
- |2
                          produc- tion and thus constructing a new
- |2
                      society.The system of Co-operative Industry accomplishes this, not by the
- |2
                              vain search after foreign markets throughout the globe, no sooner
- |2
                              found than over-stocked and glutted by the restless competition of
- |2
                              the starving producers, but by the voluntary union of the
- |2
                              industrious or productive classes, in such numbers as to afford a market to each other, by working together
- |2
                                  for each other, for the mutual supply,
- |2
                              directly by themselves, of all their most indispensable wants, in
- |2
                              the way of food, clothing, dwelling, and furniture

                          (Thompson, p. III).
- |2
                      Nineteenth-century anarchism first received form and content from
- |2
                      Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. The use of the words
- |2
                      “anarchy” and “anarchist” in the
- |2
                      nineteenth century goes back to Proudhon, who used
- |2
                      “anarchy” for the first time in the sense of absence
- |2
                      of sovereignty (What is Property?, 1840). Later
- |2
                      Proudhon spoke, in his Solution du problème
- |2
                          social, of the ideal republic as a positive
- |2
                          anarchy. “It is neither liberty, subordi- nated to order, as in a constitutional monarchy,
- |2
                      nor liberty in presenting order. It is reciprocal liberty and not
- |2
                      limited liberty; liberty is not the daughter but the
- |2
                       mother of order” (Cole, I, 202). Proudhon's
- |2
                      influence on subsequent anarchist thought has been threefold: (1) his
- |2
                      attack on the Jacobin principle, his denunciation of the State, and his
- |2
                      rejection of representative democ- racy; (2)
- |2
                      his proposal to replace the State by groups of individuals, united for
- |2
                      productive purposes; (3) his theory of federalism. According to Proudhon,
- |2
                      economic and social exploitation was correlated with political
- |2
                      oppression. Nothing is feasible by spontaneous initi- ative, independent actions of individuals and collectiv- ities as long as they are in the
- |2
                      presence of this colossal power which is given to the State by
- |2
                      centralization. Proudhon rejected a state corporation as advocated by
- |2
                      Louis Blanc. Although he thought mainly in terms of small-scale economic
- |2
                      activity, he envisaged for the future large industry and agriculture
- |2
                      developed from association. Proudhon advocated a great central Credit
- |2
                      Bank, an independent institution apart from the State, making through
- |2
                      subsidiary branches interest-free ad- vances of
- |2
                      capital, to ensure means of labor to each producer, or workers'
- |2
                      organizations to ensure to each producer the full product of his labor.
- |2
                      Products would be exchanged at cost value by means of labor checks
- |2
                      based on the labor-time theory of value associated with Robert Owen and the
- |2
                      Ricardian socialists. Proudhon called this system
- |2
                      “mutualism.”Two outstanding representatives of anarchist indi-
- |2
                          vidualism are Max Stirner and Benjamin Tucker. InDer Einzige und sein Eigenthum (1844; trans. as
- |2
                          The Ego and his Own), Stirner, a philosopher and
- |2
                      a social and political thinker, developed the view that law and the
- |2
                      State deprived the individual of his uniqueness. As all forms of government
- |2
                      arise from the principle that all right and all authority belong to the
- |2
                      collectivity, it is indifferent who exercises the authority, for the
- |2
                      collectivity is always above the individual. The State acts with violence
- |2
                      and claims that its laws are sacred. He who affronts them is a criminal.
- |2
                      Every man's wel- fare demands that a social life
- |2
                      based solely on the welfare of the individual take the place of the
- |2
                      State. The State exists through voluntary servitude. What do laws
- |2
                      amount to if no one obeys them? What do orders amount to if nobody lets
- |2
                      himself be ordered? The State is not imaginable without rulers and
- |2
                      servitude; for the State must will to be the lord of all that it
- |2
                      embraces, and this will is called the “will of the
- |2
                      State.” The workers have the most enormous power in their
- |2
                      hands and if they once became thoroughly conscious of it and used it,
- |2
                      nothing would withstand them. The State rests on the slavery of labor. If
- |2
                      labor becomes free, the State is lost.Benjamin R. Tucker rejected any communistic solu-
- |2
                      tion of the social problem as incompatible with the
- |2
                      “sovereignty of the individual,” as postulated by theMichael Bakunin, a prolific but incoherent writer, developed his anarchist
- |2
                      ideas from 1864 on. Starting from Hegel's idealism, Bakunin's philosophical
- |2
                      ideas were molded by the humanism of Ludwig Feuerbach. Atheism became
- |2
                      an essential part of his doctrine. He regarded the idea of God as
- |2
                      fundamentally inconsistent with human freedom. With Bakunin, anarchist
- |2
                      thought became linked with anarchist organizations and working-class
- |2
                      movements, and became a political movement. His doctrine inspired socialist
- |2
                      movements in France, Italy, Switzerland, and in Spain, where its
- |2
                      influence lasted longest. Like Proudhon, Bakunin at-
- |2
                          tacked the concept of the centralized state even when it
- |2
                      appeared as the democratic representation of the people or as the
- |2
                      instrument of a hitherto exploited class. He envisaged a revolution to
- |2
                      expropriate capital and land, but not by the state, which to be able
- |2
                      to fulfil its political and economic mission (as state- socialists advocate) would
- |2
                      necessarily have to be very powerful and strongly concentrated. He foresaw
- |2
                      even greater exploitation, and in the development of the modern great
- |2
                      powers and in the growing influence of economic monopoly, the greatest
- |2
                      danger for the future of Europe.Bakunin's anarchist ideas are most fully expressed in the
- |2
                      programs—mostly drafts—which he wrote for the secret
- |2
                      societies he tried to organize. He was con-
- |2
                      vinced that a small number of individuals, acting in common with the
- |2
                      masses, could and should essentially influence the course of historic
- |2
                      events. Bakunin's social theory is a critical application of anarchism with
- |2
                      a view to changing the political and social system. He rejected
- |2
                      Proudhon's mutualism as a solution of the social prob-
- |2
                          lem, and also the belief in the possibility of eliminating
- |2
                      capitalism by peaceful means. However, Proudhon's anti-Jacobin and
- |2
                      federalist ideas influenced him, but he rejected every form of state
- |2
                      socialism:I detest communism because it is the negation of liberty and I can
- |2
                              conceive nothing human without liberty. I am no communist because
- |2
                              communism concentrates and aims at the absorption of all powers of
- |2
                              society; the radical extir
- |2
                              pation of that principle of authority and guardianship
- |2
                              of the state which under the pretext of moralizing and civi- lizing men, has hitherto
- |2
                              enslaved, oppressed, exploited and depraved them
- |2
                          (Bakunin [1873], p. 28; trans. G. D. H. Cole).
- |2
                      He stood for the organization of society arranged from below upward on the
- |2
                      basis of collective and social property, by way of free association.Bakunin, the great antagonist of Marx in the “First
- |2
                      International” (1864), not only objected to the theory of the
- |2
                      state and dictatorship but regarded the Marxian interpretation of Hegel's
- |2
                      dialectic, that socialism would be the result of an inevitable,
- |2
                      historically determined, scientific process, as a fallacy. He was very
- |2
                      critical of the prospect that science would regulate human and social
- |2
                      affairs, “the reign of scientific intelligence would be a
- |2
                      despotism, more demoralizing and worse than any previous despotism, and
- |2
                      resulting in a new class, a hierarchy of real and fictitious scientists,
- |2
                      and the world would be divided between a minority in the name of
- |2
                      science and an immense ignorant majority” (Archives Bakounine, II, 204).Peter Kropotkin, scientist, historian, and social re-
- |2
                          former, contributed perhaps more then anyone else to the
- |2
                      elaboration and propagation of anarchism. In his classic, anti-Darwinist,
- |2
                      sociological work Mutual Aid: a Factor of Evolution
- |2
                      (1902) he sets out to show that mutual aid is as important an aspect in
- |2
                      nature and in society as the struggle for survival. The dominating
- |2
                      importance of the principle of mutual aid appears also in the domain of
- |2
                      ethics. Konrad Lorenz wrote that mutual aid is the only phylogenetical
- |2
                      adapted mecha- nism of behavior. By combining
- |2
                      his scientific and social aspirations, Kropotkin tried to find a scientific
- |2
                      basis of anarchism but never found a very convincing one. The very
- |2
                      basis of his faith is a belief in cooperativeness as a natural human
- |2
                      quality. The process of individ-
- |2
                      ualization, or “individuation” as modern
- |2
                      psychologists would call it, i.e., self-realization, will not lead to
- |2
                      isolation, but to an intense and more universal col-
- |2
                          lective solidarity. He believed in the coordination of industry
- |2
                      and agriculture; small communities which would control the means of
- |2
                      production and counteract the tendency of centralized mass production. He
- |2
                          al- ways stressed the importance of the
- |2
                      institutes created by the workers themselves as cooperative societies
- |2
                      and trade unions. After the Russian Revolution he stated (1919) that
- |2
                      as long as the country was governed by a party dictatorship, the workers'
- |2
                      and peasant councils lost their entire significance.Errico Malatesta, who spent a life of incessant revo- lutionary activity spreading anarchist propaganda in
- |2
                      Europe and in America, was, like Kropotkin, an anarcho-communist. But while
- |2
                      Kropotkin stressed theThe Russian Revolution developed initially on Bakuninist lines: the state
- |2
                      and its institutions were destroyed and replaced by
- |2
                      “soviets,” i.e., councils of workers and peasants,
- |2
                      who expropriated the factories and the land. These soviets, in which the
- |2
                      constructive element of the revolution was embodied, disintegrated
- |2
                      after the Bolsheviks had succeeded in founding a “rev- olutionary state” and a
- |2
                      party dictatorship. The liqui- dation by the
- |2
                      Red Army (March 1921) of the Commune of Kronstadt, which stood for
- |2
                      “all power to the Soviets and not to the Party,”
- |2
                      marked the end of the inde- pendent soviets.The most important historical example of an attempt to put anarchist
- |2
                      principles into practice was the in- dustrial
- |2
                      and agricultural “collectivizations” during the first
- |2
                      months of the Spanish Civil War. Within forty-
- |2
                          eight hours of the uprising, on July 19, 1936, the whole
- |2
                      economic and social life of Catalonia and many other parts of Spain was
- |2
                      taken over by the syndicates. Fac- tories,
- |2
                      railways, and workshops, as well as all social services, were run by
- |2
                      workers' councils. The continu- ation of
- |2
                      the armed struggle, the government control of production and finance, the
- |2
                      counterrevolutionary policy of the communists after the Stalin
- |2
                      intervention, the compromises made in the name of “victory
- |2
                      over Franco,” e.g., the participation of the anarchists'
- |2
                       leaders in the government, were all factors tending to
- |2
                      undermine this kind of social reconstruction.In order to define the role played by anarchism in the light of the
- |2
                      experience of a rapidly changing soci- ety, two
- |2
                      different tendencies can be noticed. Since the defeat of the powerful
- |2
                      anarchist movement in the Spanish Civil War, anarchist movements
- |2
                      everywhere have declined and lost their impetus. But anarchist ideas
- |2
                      have outlived their partisans and may still be of value as doctrines of
- |2
                      social reconstruction. The state has changed its character. The
- |2
                      laissez-faire state of the nineteenth century has developed into an ever
- |2
                          in- creasing bureaucracy. In a growing
- |2
                      process powerful political institutions and industrial monopolies are in- tertwined in an excessively centralized
- |2
                      structure not dreamed of by any anarchist thinker.The anarchist criticism of the state and of authority, far from being
- |2
                      invalidated by this modern develop- ment,
- |2
                      may be more relevant than when the theory was created. This may explain the
- |2
                      growing interest in the 1960's in anarchist ideas. Kropotkin's ideal of a
- |2
                          region- ally decentralized economy could
- |2
                      be regarded at the time as rather utopian and irreconcilable with the
- |2
                      economic and political trend of society. But the new developments in an age
- |2
                      of cybernetic potentially un- limited
- |2
                      technology could easily free society of work and want, to live in a world
- |2
                      of plenty. The use of new sources of power may reduce the necessity of
- |2
                          present- day, gigantic economic units,
- |2
                      and may make the widest distribution of industry, agriculture, and culture
- |2
                          possi- ble in the political as well as in
- |2
                      the social field. This however would not guarantee automatically a de- creased authority, as new communications and
- |2
                          com- puter techniques could just as well
- |2
                      produce a greater development of authority. In other words, such a
- |2
                      trend to decentralization would only be realized if based on an
- |2
                      interregional federation, in which the region, as defined by Lewis Mumford,
- |2
                      is the basic configuration in human life, a permanent sphere of cultural

  \               ANARCHISM\n                \n                        General Principles.\n
  \                    Anarchism is a social philosophy and a political doctrine based
  on\n                    the value of individual freedom. As such it is linked up
  with liberal and\n                    all other kinds of progressive ideas. Essential
  for anarchist thought,\n                    however, is the rejection of all coercive
  au-\n                    thority exercised by men over men. The Greek wordan-archy
  must have meant absence of authority or071\n                     government. The
  word “anarchy,” describing a\n                        state- less society, was for
  the first\n                    time used by Louis Armand de Lahontan in his Nouveaux\n
  \                       voyages dans l'Amérique septentrionale (1703),\n                    describing
  the Indians living in a society without state, laws, prisons,\n                    priests,
  private property, in short, “in anarchy.”\n                    Colloquially however,
  anarchy became identical with confusion and disorder.\n                A wide diversity
  of anarchist views can be found in the works of\n                    philosophers,
  religious thinkers, writers, and poets throughout the ages;\n                    for
  example, in Diderot's “I don't wish either to give or to\n                    obey
  laws,” we have a short and perfect statement of the\n                    anarchist
  creed. Opposing Plato's “state communism,”\n                    Zeno, the founder
  of the Stoa school, advocated a society without\n                    government.
  Laws should be abolished, since virtue and morality could only\n                    be
  achieved in liberty.\n                As a general principle, anarchism advocates
  a society from which the\n                    coercive elements have been removed.
  Like anarchism, liberalism stemmed\n                    from the concern for freedom,
  and the wish to keep the activities of\n                    the state and the functions
  of government to a minimum. Anarchism,\n                    however, holds that
  liberal postulates are realizable only on the basis of\n                    the
  abolition of economic monopoly and the coercive institutions of\n                    political
  power because, while equality is quite possible without\n                    liberty,
  there can be no liberty without social and economic equality;\n                    “liberty
  without socialism is privi-\n                    lege, injustice; and socialism
  without liberty is slavery and\n                    brutality” (Bakunin). The liberal
  view of the “min- imization” of the state and\n                    its replacement
  by free federalist groups, was first expounded by Wilhelm\n                    von
  Humboldt in his treatise, Ideen zu einem Versuch,\n                        die Grenzen
  der Wirksamkeit des Staats zu bestimmen,\n                    written in 1792 and
  published in 1851 (English trans.The Sphere and Duties of Government, 1854). John\n
  \                   Stuart Mill was influenced by this work in writing On\n                        Liberty
  (1859). Both works exposed the danger in de- mocracy of the “tyranny of the\n                    majority,”
  using prin- ciples very\n                    close to anarchist doctrine.\n                Anarchism
  holds that there is no conflict or irrecon- cilability between the rights of the
  individual\n                    and society. Sociologically anarchism is based on
  the dis- tinction between state and society. As\n                    men continually
  are bound to work together for almost any purpose,\n                    their aims
  will be achieved more efficiently if the guiding principle is\n                    solidarity
  or “mutual aid.” The individual is not\n                    only a single entity,
  but his very existence presupposes also a collective\n                    relationship.
  Anarchism postulates that human potentialities, spon- taneity, individuality, and
  initiative,\n                    buried in an au- thoritarian society and\n                    in
  a network of bureaucratic institutions, can be freed by\n                    de-institutionalizing
  soci- ety. Life-enhancing\n                    processes of society will be liber-
  ated with\n                    the passing of the domination of the state,\n                     which
  is regarded as a tumor on the body politic. The state,\n                    the
  supreme authority, with its machinery (the government) which carries\n                    more
  power than is re- quired for\n                    administration—i.e., the “political
  sur- plus”—should be abolished.\n                Education has always played an
  important part in anarchist doctrines. Modern\n                    psychology and
  education, with its child-centered principle of\n                    self-education
  and self-discipline, has distinctive anarchist implications\n                    in
  this respect. In recent times new schools in criminology\n                    (especially
  in the USA, and partly in England and the Netherlands) have\n                    advocated
  a change of attitude in judging delinquents and in recognizing\n                    their
  right to some forms of deviant behavior, and to being regarded\n                    as
  equals instead of being made by authority to adapt to the actual\n                    dominant
  pattern. The abolition of the punitive element in justice as well\n                    as
  the abolition of prisons as “seminars of vice,”\n                    “where man
  comes out worse than he enters” (William\n                    Godwin), is gaining
  ground.\n                The essence of the artist as a creative individual implies
  absolute freedom\n                    to realize his aesthetic aims, and suo ipso\n
  \                   anarchistic thought, even if he is not aware of its theoretical
  basis. In\n                    our age, without abandoning its traditional aesthetic
  norms in art this\n                    need for free- dom becomes even more evident.\n
  \                   Anarchism postulates that without coercion and stringent outside\n
  \                   regulations everyone would have greater possibilities to develop
  his\n                    potential creative personality.\n                \n                        Different
  Trends.\n                     Although different trends— anarcho-communism,\n                    individualism,
  collectivism, mu- tualism, and\n                    all the intermediate programs—can
  be distinguished, all\n                    anarchist schools of thought have a fundamental
  conception in common, viz.,\n                    freedom of the individual, rejection
  of government, state, and all\n                    coercive institutions. These
  forms of anarchism are simply the ways\n                    considered best for
  achieving freedom and solidarity in economic life, the\n                    ways
  believed to correspond most closely with justice and freedom for\n                    the
  distribution of the means of production and the products of labor among\n                    men.
  It is the constant searching for a more secure guarantee of\n                    freedom
  which is the common factor amongst anarchists even when\n                    divided
  into different schools. “The achievement of the greatest\n                    measures
  of individualism is in direct ratio to the amount of communism\n                    that
  is possible; that is to say, a maximum of solidarity in order to\n                    enjoy
  a maximum of freedom” (Malatesta [1926], p. 82).\n                Bakunist anarchism
  was called in the late 1860's\n                    “collectivism.” Anarcho-communism,
  rejecting the ex- treme of individualist anarchism, as a\n                    variation
  of collectivism laid the emphasis on communist distribu- tion and local and communal\n
  \                   association. Developed mainly by Kropotkin since the end of
  the seventies,072\n                     this communal form became the dominating
  trend of anarchism in\n                    the following decades. The anarcho-\n
  \                       communists who regarded trade unions as instruments in the\n
  \                   struggle for the economic and social improve-\n                    ment
  of the working class within the framework of existing society\n                    and
  as the means to carry out revolu- tion\n                    and social reconstruction,
  called themselves anarcho-syndicalists. The\n                    ultimate goal of
  anarcho-\n                    syndicalism, identical with that of collective anarchism,
  is to\n                    raise the masses to independent management of production
  and distribution\n                    by the common action of all manual and intellectual
  working men of\n                    every branch in industry.\n                Violence
  is not an essential part of anarchism. Nei-\n                        ther is terrorism.
  Because of the spectacular attentats and outrages, connected with the names of\n
  \                   Ravachol, Auguste Vaillant, Emil Henry, Santo Caserio, mainly
  in\n                    France (1891-94), and of later syndicalist bombings, anarchism
  and\n                    terrorism became associated in the public mind. Their acts
  were usually\n                    retaliation for the persecution and repression
  by the government and\n                    they did not believe in any social organization
  by the work- ing class, or in propaganda, and acted in a state of\n                    rebellion
  against society. However, their acts of rebel- lion were isolated, and the number
  of anarchists\n                    who took part in them was always very small.
  Most of the terrorists in\n                    modern times were not anarchists.\n
  \               Some anarchist currents, like Christian and Tolstoyan anarchism,
  reject all\n                    violence. Central to Leo Tolstoy's religious anarchism,
  derived from the\n                    Scriptures, is the rejection of the state
  and of all authority exercised\n                    by men over men, the denial
  of property, and the need for moral\n                    revolution by persuasion
  and example, as well as by experiments of communal\n                    living.
  Men should destroy the state by ceasing to cooperate with it,\n                    and
  by forming new social organizations and patterns of behavior.\n                    Refusal
  to obey, an essential principle of Tolstoy's teaching, influenced\n                    Gandhi
  in his principle of nonviolent noncooperation. Gandhi was inspired\n                    also
  by Henry David Thoreau's treatise On the Duty\n                        of Civil
  Disobedience (1849). These ideas of individual\n                    resistance can
  be summarized in the words of Étienne de la\n                    Boétie: “Resolve
  no longer to serve and you will be\n                    free.” Anselme Bellegarrique
  would write (1850):\n                    “There are no tyrants, there are only slaves.”
  Non- cooperation, nonretaliation,\n                    nonviolent resistance, war
  resistance, boycott, and direct action are\n                    applications all
  derived from these principles.\n                \n                        Political
  Doctrine.\n                     Anarchist thought exercised its main influence as
  a political\n                    doctrine. As such it is part of the history of
  socialist thought, of which\n                    it represents the libertarian and
  anti-Jacobin trend. Like socialism,\n                    anarchism is a product
  of the political and industrial revolutions. As a\n                    matter of
  fact the history of modern\n                     anarchist thought and anarchist
  movement is bound up since the\n                    middle of the nineteenth century
  with the history of the labor movement. It\n                    is strongly in-
  fluenced by Marxist ideas\n                    about the class struggle and the
  emphasis of the economic side of the\n                    emancipation of the laboring
  classes.\n                Anarchism—in contrast with Marxian theory— rejects the\n
  \                   theory of the political organization of the labor class with
  a view to the\n                    conquest of the state. It rejects pressure through
  the mechanism of parlia- mentary parties as well as\n                    dictatorship
  in the period of the revolution as instruments to achieve\n                    these
  ends. It objects to representative government and to parlia- mentary democracy because
  it denies\n                    that in a political sense one man should represent
  another, unless he\n                    is a delegate to represent a group in relation
  to a definite issue or\n                    form of activity, and is always subject
  to recall.\n                Marx, and Engels too, defined anarchy as the final stage
  of socialism, i.e.,\n                    a classless and stateless society. Anarchism
  however regards the Marxian\n                    theory of the inevitability of
  the historical economic process,\n                    leading to the conquest of
  power and subsequently the\n                    “withering away of the state” as
  a fallacy and as uto- pian dialectics.\n                Anarchism recognizes only
  regional differences and demands for every group\n                    the right
  of self-deter- mination in\n                    solidarity with all other associations
  of an economic or territorial order.\n                    Federalism is an essen-
  tial part of its\n                    doctrine. In place of the present state organization,
  anarchism would\n                    establish a federation of free communities
  which would be bound to one\n                    another by their common and social
  interests, and would arrange their\n                    affairs by mutual agreement
  and free contract.\n                \n                        Theorists.\n                     The
  first systematic exposition is the po-\n                        litical treatise
  of William Godwin, An Enquiry\n                            con- cerning Political
  Justice and\n                        its Influence on General Virtue and Happiness
  (1793). The title is\n                    a good sum- mary of the content. The main
  claim\n                    of Godwin as founder of modern anarchism is that in Godwin's
  opin- ion all moral evils are caused by political\n                    institutions.
  A disciple of eighteenth-century philosophical ration- alism and belief in the perfectibility\n
  \                   of man, i.e., a continuous advance towards higher rationality,
  Godwin\n                    believed that men behaved irrationally because the conventional\n
  \                   institutions of society led them to stray from reason. Man's
  character\n                    depends on external cir- cumstances, and\n                    social
  prejudice and government should be abolished, as government\n                    constitutes
  the frequent source of crime, villainy, and injustice.\n                    Godwin
  questioned the legitimacy of every form of government and coercion,\n                    and
  envisaged a future of free enlightened cooperation of individuals,\n                    grouped
  in small communities.\n                073\n                \n                The
  importance Godwin attached to education, i.e., to the purpose of\n                    developing
  the child's autonomy, is common to most anarchist schools of\n                    thought.
  The emphasis on the influence of environment in the for- mation of character and
  in the shaping of\n                    human con- duct, was to be taken over by
  Robert\n                    Owen and de- veloped as an integral part of\n                    Owenite
  socialism. Godwin's anarchism rested on an absolute exaltation\n                    of
  the claim of individual conscience enlightened by reason, involving a\n                    repudiation
  of any duty of obedi- ence, save\n                    to the demands of reason.
  Through Shelley, who adopted his philosophy and\n                    who wrote to
  Godwin: “You are the regulator and former of my\n                    mind,” an-
  archism became a theme\n                    of world literature.\n                If
  Godwin tried to persuade, Charles Fourier empha-\n                        sized
  the example of small communities (phalanstères), free and voluntary associations
  (communes socié-\n                        taires), mainly agricultural, without
  any authority\n                    and coercion, and with a variety of types of
  work suited for every\n                    person, corresponding to the natural
  variety of human desires. He analyzed\n                    the psychological con-
  ditions of work, and\n                    believed he had discovered the law of
  “attraction,” a\n                    permanent contribution to the problem of work
  and of the incentives and\n                    their rela- tions to it. Free experiments
  are\n                    an essential part of anti-authoritarian socialism.\n                William
  Thompson, influenced by Godwin, Ben-\n                    tham, and Owen, advocated
  direct action by the pro- ducers, using trade unionism as a means for their own\n
  \                   emancipation without the help of the government. He devised
  a constructive\n                    plan for the emancipation of labor by establishing
  cooperative societies of\n                        produc- tion and thus constructing
  a new\n                    society.\n                \n                    \n                        The
  system of Co-operative Industry accomplishes this, not by the\n                            vain
  search after foreign markets throughout the globe, no sooner\n                            found
  than over-stocked and glutted by the restless competition of\n                            the
  starving producers, but by the voluntary union of the\n                            industrious
  or productive classes, in such numbers as to afford a market to each other, by working
  together\n                                for each other, for the mutual supply,\n
  \                           directly by themselves, of all their most indispensable
  wants, in\n                            the way of food, clothing, dwelling, and
  furniture\n                    \n                    \n                        (Thompson,
  p. III).\n                    \n                \n                Nineteenth-century
  anarchism first received form and content from\n                    Pierre-Joseph
  Proudhon. The use of the words\n                    “anarchy” and “anarchist” in
  the\n                    nineteenth century goes back to Proudhon, who used\n                    “anarchy”
  for the first time in the sense of absence\n                    of sovereignty (What
  is Property?, 1840). Later\n                    Proudhon spoke, in his Solution
  du problème\n                        social, of the ideal republic as a positive\n
  \                       anarchy. “It is neither liberty, subordi- nated to order,
  as in a constitutional monarchy,\n                    nor liberty in presenting
  order. It is reciprocal liberty and not\n                    limited liberty; liberty
  is not the daughter but the\n                     mother of order” (Cole, I, 202).
  Proudhon's\n                    influence on subsequent anarchist thought has been
  threefold: (1) his\n                    attack on the Jacobin principle, his denunciation
  of the State, and his\n                    rejection of representative democ- racy;
  (2)\n                    his proposal to replace the State by groups of individuals,
  united for\n                    productive purposes; (3) his theory of federalism.
  According to Proudhon,\n                    economic and social exploitation was
  correlated with political\n                    oppression. Nothing is feasible by
  spontaneous initi- ative, independent actions of individuals and collectiv- ities
  as long as they are in the\n                    presence of this colossal power
  which is given to the State by\n                    centralization. Proudhon rejected
  a state corporation as advocated by\n                    Louis Blanc. Although he
  thought mainly in terms of small-scale economic\n                    activity, he
  envisaged for the future large industry and agriculture\n                    developed
  from association. Proudhon advocated a great central Credit\n                    Bank,
  an independent institution apart from the State, making through\n                    subsidiary
  branches interest-free ad- vances of\n                    capital, to ensure means
  of labor to each producer, or workers'\n                    organizations to ensure
  to each producer the full product of his labor.\n                    Products would
  be exchanged at cost value by means of labor checks\n                    based on
  the labor-time theory of value associated with Robert Owen and the\n                    Ricardian
  socialists. Proudhon called this system\n                    “mutualism.”\n                Two
  outstanding representatives of anarchist indi-\n                        vidualism
  are Max Stirner and Benjamin Tucker. InDer Einzige und sein Eigenthum (1844; trans.
  as\n                        The Ego and his Own), Stirner, a philosopher and\n                    a
  social and political thinker, developed the view that law and the\n                    State
  deprived the individual of his uniqueness. As all forms of government\n                    arise
  from the principle that all right and all authority belong to the\n                    collectivity,
  it is indifferent who exercises the authority, for the\n                    collectivity
  is always above the individual. The State acts with violence\n                    and
  claims that its laws are sacred. He who affronts them is a criminal.\n                    Every
  man's wel- fare demands that a social life\n                    based solely on
  the welfare of the individual take the place of the\n                    State.
  The State exists through voluntary servitude. What do laws\n                    amount
  to if no one obeys them? What do orders amount to if nobody lets\n                    himself
  be ordered? The State is not imaginable without rulers and\n                    servitude;
  for the State must will to be the lord of all that it\n                    embraces,
  and this will is called the “will of the\n                    State.” The workers
  have the most enormous power in their\n                    hands and if they once
  became thoroughly conscious of it and used it,\n                    nothing would
  withstand them. The State rests on the slavery of labor. If\n                    labor
  becomes free, the State is lost.\n                Benjamin R. Tucker rejected any
  communistic solu-\n                    tion of the social problem as incompatible
  with the\n                    “sovereignty of the individual,” as postulated by
  the074\n                     first American exponents of individual anarchism such
  as Josiah\n                    Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews. Their intellectual
  development was not\n                    influenced by European libertarian or radical
  ideas, but rooted in the\n                    liberal principles of the Declaration
  of Independence. In the first half of\n                    the nineteenth century,
  American “philosophical\n                    anarchism” was a product of the social
  conditions of the\n                    country. There was a belief in the effectiveness
  of practical experiments,\n                    and their social and economic ideas
  were based on the right to full\n                    product of one's labor, an
  equitable commerce on the basis of cost as the\n                    limit of price,
  i.e., similar to what Proudhon had conceived in his\n                    “mutualist”
  ideas.\n                Michael Bakunin, a prolific but incoherent writer, developed
  his anarchist\n                    ideas from 1864 on. Starting from Hegel's idealism,
  Bakunin's philosophical\n                    ideas were molded by the humanism of
  Ludwig Feuerbach. Atheism became\n                    an essential part of his doctrine.
  He regarded the idea of God as\n                    fundamentally inconsistent with
  human freedom. With Bakunin, anarchist\n                    thought became linked
  with anarchist organizations and working-class\n                    movements, and
  became a political movement. His doctrine inspired socialist\n                    movements
  in France, Italy, Switzerland, and in Spain, where its\n                    influence
  lasted longest. Like Proudhon, Bakunin at-\n                        tacked the concept
  of the centralized state even when it\n                    appeared as the democratic
  representation of the people or as the\n                    instrument of a hitherto
  exploited class. He envisaged a revolution to\n                    expropriate capital
  and land, but not by the state, which to be able\n                    to fulfil
  its political and economic mission (as state- socialists advocate) would\n                    necessarily
  have to be very powerful and strongly concentrated. He foresaw\n                    even
  greater exploitation, and in the development of the modern great\n                    powers
  and in the growing influence of economic monopoly, the greatest\n                    danger
  for the future of Europe.\n                Bakunin's anarchist ideas are most fully
  expressed in the\n                    programs—mostly drafts—which he wrote for
  the secret\n                    societies he tried to organize. He was con-\n                    vinced
  that a small number of individuals, acting in common with the\n                    masses,
  could and should essentially influence the course of historic\n                    events.
  Bakunin's social theory is a critical application of anarchism with\n                    a
  view to changing the political and social system. He rejected\n                    Proudhon's
  mutualism as a solution of the social prob-\n                        lem, and also
  the belief in the possibility of eliminating\n                    capitalism by
  peaceful means. However, Proudhon's anti-Jacobin and\n                    federalist
  ideas influenced him, but he rejected every form of state\n                    socialism:\n

  of moralizing and civi- lizing men, has hitherto\n                            enslaved,
  oppressed, exploited and depraved them\n                    \n                    \n

  \               \n                He stood for the organization of society arranged
  from below upward on the\n                    basis of collective and social property,
  by way of free association.\n                Bakunin, the great antagonist of Marx
  in the “First\n                    International” (1864), not only objected to the
  theory of the\n                    state and dictatorship but regarded the Marxian
  interpretation of Hegel's\n                    dialectic, that socialism would be
  the result of an inevitable,\n                    historically determined, scientific
  process, as a fallacy. He was very\n                    critical of the prospect
  that science would regulate human and social\n                    affairs, “the
  reign of scientific intelligence would be a\n                    despotism, more
  demoralizing and worse than any previous despotism, and\n                    resulting
  in a new class, a hierarchy of real and fictitious scientists,\n                    and
  the world would be divided between a minority in the name of\n                    science
  and an immense ignorant majority” (Archives Bakounine, II, 204).\n                Peter
  Kropotkin, scientist, historian, and social re-\n                        former,
  contributed perhaps more then anyone else to the\n                    elaboration
  and propagation of anarchism. In his classic, anti-Darwinist,\n                    sociological
  work Mutual Aid: a Factor of Evolution\n                    (1902) he sets out to
  show that mutual aid is as important an aspect in\n                    nature and
  in society as the struggle for survival. The dominating\n                    importance
  of the principle of mutual aid appears also in the domain of\n                    ethics.
  Konrad Lorenz wrote that mutual aid is the only phylogenetical\n                    adapted
  mecha- nism of behavior. By combining\n                    his scientific and social
  aspirations, Kropotkin tried to find a scientific\n                    basis of
  anarchism but never found a very convincing one. The very\n                    basis
  of his faith is a belief in cooperativeness as a natural human\n                    quality.
  The process of individ-\n                    ualization, or “individuation” as modern\n
  \                   psychologists would call it, i.e., self-realization, will not
  lead to\n                    isolation, but to an intense and more universal col-\n
  \                       lective solidarity. He believed in the coordination of industry\n
  \                   and agriculture; small communities which would control the means
  of\n                    production and counteract the tendency of centralized mass
  production. He\n                        al- ways stressed the importance of the\n
  \                   institutes created by the workers themselves as cooperative
  societies\n                    and trade unions. After the Russian Revolution he
  stated (1919) that\n                    as long as the country was governed by a
  party dictatorship, the workers'\n                    and peasant councils lost
  their entire significance.\n                Errico Malatesta, who spent a life of
  incessant revo- lutionary activity spreading anarchist propaganda in\n                    Europe
  and in America, was, like Kropotkin, an anarcho-communist. But while\n                    Kropotkin
  stressed the075\n                     importance of free association, Malatesta
  emphasized the role\n                    of the conscious minority and of revolutionary
  actions. Malatesta started\n                    his anarchist career in the 1870's
  as a follower of Bakunin, but in later\n                    years he thought the
  economic and historical approach of Bakunin too\n                    Marxist. Although
  no opponent of syndi-\n                    calism, he did not share with the anarcho-syndicalists
  their belief\n                    that creating a mass movement through the trade
  unions was an essential,\n                    constructive element in the revolution.
  He accepted the syndicalist\n                    theory of the general strike insofar
  as it was insurrectional and\n                    expropriative, in fact, insofar
  as it was an effective means of social\n                    transformation. He did
  not share Kropotkin's optimism, or his scientific\n                    interpretation
  of anarchism. He was a pragmatic anarchist and held\n                    that the
  mean task of anarchists was to make and to help to make the\n                    revolution.
  He advanced the revolu- tion as\n                    much as possible in his constructive
  as well as destructive roles, always\n                    opposing the formation
  of any government. He also held that abolition of\n                    political
  power without the simultaneous destruction of eco- nomic privilege was not possible.
  He shared\n                    these views with Bakunin, including the rejection
  of terror. In\n                    revolution one must attack institutions; then
  it will not be necessary to\n                    destroy people, and to foster the
  inevitable reaction which is always\n                    caused by the mas- sacre
  of men.\n                    “Terror,” wrote Malatesta, “has always\n                    been
  the instrument of tyranny.”\n                The Russian Revolution developed initially
  on Bakuninist lines: the state\n                    and its institutions were destroyed
  and replaced by\n                    “soviets,” i.e., councils of workers and peasants,\n
  \                   who expropriated the factories and the land. These soviets,
  in which the\n                    constructive element of the revolution was embodied,
  disintegrated\n                    after the Bolsheviks had succeeded in founding
  a “rev- olutionary state” and a\n                    party dictatorship. The liqui-
  dation by the\n                    Red Army (March 1921) of the Commune of Kronstadt,
  which stood for\n                    “all power to the Soviets and not to the Party,”\n
  \                   marked the end of the inde- pendent soviets.\n                The
  most important historical example of an attempt to put anarchist\n                    principles
  into practice was the in- dustrial\n                    and agricultural “collectivizations”
  during the first\n                    months of the Spanish Civil War. Within forty-\n
  \                       eight hours of the uprising, on July 19, 1936, the whole\n
  \                   economic and social life of Catalonia and many other parts of
  Spain was\n                    taken over by the syndicates. Fac- tories,\n                    railways,
  and workshops, as well as all social services, were run by\n                    workers'
  councils. The continu- ation of\n                    the armed struggle, the government
  control of production and finance, the\n                    counterrevolutionary
  policy of the communists after the Stalin\n                    intervention, the
  compromises made in the name of “victory\n                    over Franco,” e.g.,
  the participation of the anarchists'\n                     leaders in the government,
  were all factors tending to\n                    undermine this kind of social reconstruction.\n
  \               In order to define the role played by anarchism in the light of
  the\n                    experience of a rapidly changing soci- ety, two\n                    different
  tendencies can be noticed. Since the defeat of the powerful\n                    anarchist
  movement in the Spanish Civil War, anarchist movements\n                    everywhere
  have declined and lost their impetus. But anarchist ideas\n                    have
  outlived their partisans and may still be of value as doctrines of\n                    social
  reconstruction. The state has changed its character. The\n                    laissez-faire
  state of the nineteenth century has developed into an ever\n                        in-
  creasing bureaucracy. In a growing\n                    process powerful political
  institutions and industrial monopolies are in- tertwined in an excessively centralized\n
  \                   structure not dreamed of by any anarchist thinker.\n                The
  anarchist criticism of the state and of authority, far from being\n                    invalidated
  by this modern develop- ment,\n                    may be more relevant than when
  the theory was created. This may explain the\n                    growing interest
  in the 1960's in anarchist ideas. Kropotkin's ideal of a\n                        region-
  ally decentralized economy could\n                    be regarded at the time as
  rather utopian and irreconcilable with the\n                    economic and political
  trend of society. But the new developments in an age\n                    of cybernetic
  potentially un- limited\n                    technology could easily free society
  of work and want, to live in a world\n                    of plenty. The use of
  new sources of power may reduce the necessity of\n                        present-
  day, gigantic economic units,\n                    and may make the widest distribution
  of industry, agriculture, and culture\n                        possi- ble in the
  political as well as in\n                    the social field. This however would
  not guarantee automatically a de- creased authority, as new communications and\n
  \                       com- puter techniques could just as well\n                    produce
  a greater development of authority. In other words, such a\n                    trend
  to decentralization would only be realized if based on an\n                    interregional
  federation, in which the region, as defined by Lewis Mumford,\n                    is
  the basic configuration in human life, a permanent sphere of cultural\n                    influence,
  and a center of economic activity.\n                \n                    \n                        BIBLIOGRAPHY\n

  Principles.\n                     Anarchism is a social philosophy and a political
  doctrine based on\n                    the value of individual freedom. As such
  it is linked up with liberal and\n                    all other kinds of progressive
  ideas. Essential for anarchist thought,\n                    however, is the rejection
  of all coercive au-\n                    thority exercised by men over men. The
  Greek wordan-archy must have meant absence of authority orA wide diversity of anarchist
  views can be found in the works of\n                    philosophers, religious
  thinkers, writers, and poets throughout the ages;\n                    for example,
  in Diderot's “I don't wish either to give or to\n                    obey laws,”
  we have a short and perfect statement of the\n                    anarchist creed.
  Opposing Plato's “state communism,”\n                    Zeno, the founder of the
  Stoa school, advocated a society without\n                    government. Laws should
  be abolished, since virtue and morality could only\n                    be achieved
  in liberty.As a general principle, anarchism advocates a society from which the\n
  \                   coercive elements have been removed. Like anarchism, liberalism
  stemmed\n                    from the concern for freedom, and the wish to keep
  the activities of\n                    the state and the functions of government
  to a minimum. Anarchism,\n                    however, holds that liberal postulates
  are realizable only on the basis of\n                    the abolition of economic
  monopoly and the coercive institutions of\n                    political power because,
  while equality is quite possible without\n                    liberty, there can
  be no liberty without social and economic equality;\n                    “liberty
  without socialism is privi-\n                    lege, injustice; and socialism
  without liberty is slavery and\n                    brutality” (Bakunin). The liberal
  view of the “min- imization” of the state and\n                    its replacement
  by free federalist groups, was first expounded by Wilhelm\n                    von
  Humboldt in his treatise, Ideen zu einem Versuch,\n                        die Grenzen
  der Wirksamkeit des Staats zu bestimmen,\n                    written in 1792 and
  published in 1851 (English trans.The Sphere and Duties of Government, 1854). John\n
  \                   Stuart Mill was influenced by this work in writing On\n                        Liberty
  (1859). Both works exposed the danger in de- mocracy of the “tyranny of the\n                    majority,”
  using prin- ciples very\n                    close to anarchist doctrine.Anarchism
  holds that there is no conflict or irrecon- cilability between the rights of the
  individual\n                    and society. Sociologically anarchism is based on
  the dis- tinction between state and society. As\n                    men continually
  are bound to work together for almost any purpose,\n                    their aims
  will be achieved more efficiently if the guiding principle is\n                    solidarity
  or “mutual aid.” The individual is not\n                    only a single entity,
  but his very existence presupposes also a collective\n                    relationship.
  Anarchism postulates that human potentialities, spon- taneity, individuality, and
  initiative,\n                    buried in an au- thoritarian society and\n                    in
  a network of bureaucratic institutions, can be freed by\n                    de-institutionalizing
  soci- ety. Life-enhancing\n                    processes of society will be liber-
  ated with\n                    the passing of the domination of the state,\n                     which
  is regarded as a tumor on the body politic. The state,\n                    the
  supreme authority, with its machinery (the government) which carries\n                    more
  power than is re- quired for\n                    administration—i.e., the “political
  sur- plus”—should be abolished.Education has always played an important part in
  anarchist doctrines. Modern\n                    psychology and education, with
  its child-centered principle of\n                    self-education and self-discipline,
  has distinctive anarchist implications\n                    in this respect. In
  recent times new schools in criminology\n                    (especially in the
  USA, and partly in England and the Netherlands) have\n                    advocated
  a change of attitude in judging delinquents and in recognizing\n                    their
  right to some forms of deviant behavior, and to being regarded\n                    as
  equals instead of being made by authority to adapt to the actual\n                    dominant
  pattern. The abolition of the punitive element in justice as well\n                    as
  the abolition of prisons as “seminars of vice,”\n                    “where man
  comes out worse than he enters” (William\n                    Godwin), is gaining
  ground.The essence of the artist as a creative individual implies absolute freedom\n
  \                   to realize his aesthetic aims, and suo ipso\n                    anarchistic
  thought, even if he is not aware of its theoretical basis. In\n                    our
  age, without abandoning its traditional aesthetic norms in art this\n                    need
  for free- dom becomes even more evident.\n                    Anarchism postulates
  that without coercion and stringent outside\n                    regulations everyone
  would have greater possibilities to develop his\n                    potential creative
  personality.\n                        Different Trends.\n                     Although
  different trends— anarcho-communism,\n                    individualism, collectivism,
  mu- tualism, and\n                    all the intermediate programs—can be distinguished,
  all\n                    anarchist schools of thought have a fundamental conception
  in common, viz.,\n                    freedom of the individual, rejection of government,
  state, and all\n                    coercive institutions. These forms of anarchism
  are simply the ways\n                    considered best for achieving freedom and
  solidarity in economic life, the\n                    ways believed to correspond
  most closely with justice and freedom for\n                    the distribution
  of the means of production and the products of labor among\n                    men.
  It is the constant searching for a more secure guarantee of\n                    freedom
  which is the common factor amongst anarchists even when\n                    divided
  into different schools. “The achievement of the greatest\n                    measures
  of individualism is in direct ratio to the amount of communism\n                    that
  is possible; that is to say, a maximum of solidarity in order to\n                    enjoy
  a maximum of freedom” (Malatesta [1926], p. 82).Bakunist anarchism was called in
  the late 1860's\n                    “collectivism.” Anarcho-communism, rejecting
  the ex- treme of individualist anarchism, as a\n                    variation of
  collectivism laid the emphasis on communist distribu- tion and local and communal\n
  \                   association. Developed mainly by Kropotkin since the end of
  the seventies,Violence is not an essential part of anarchism. Nei-\n                        ther
  is terrorism. Because of the spectacular attentats and outrages, connected with
  the names of\n                    Ravachol, Auguste Vaillant, Emil Henry, Santo
  Caserio, mainly in\n                    France (1891-94), and of later syndicalist
  bombings, anarchism and\n                    terrorism became associated in the
  public mind. Their acts were usually\n                    retaliation for the persecution
  and repression by the government and\n                    they did not believe in
  any social organization by the work- ing class, or in propaganda, and acted in a
  state of\n                    rebellion against society. However, their acts of
  rebel- lion were isolated, and the number of anarchists\n                    who
  took part in them was always very small. Most of the terrorists in\n                    modern
  times were not anarchists.Some anarchist currents, like Christian and Tolstoyan
  anarchism, reject all\n                    violence. Central to Leo Tolstoy's religious
  anarchism, derived from the\n                    Scriptures, is the rejection of
  the state and of all authority exercised\n                    by men over men, the
  denial of property, and the need for moral\n                    revolution by persuasion
  and example, as well as by experiments of communal\n                    living.
  Men should destroy the state by ceasing to cooperate with it,\n                    and
  by forming new social organizations and patterns of behavior.\n                    Refusal
  to obey, an essential principle of Tolstoy's teaching, influenced\n                    Gandhi
  in his principle of nonviolent noncooperation. Gandhi was inspired\n                    also
  by Henry David Thoreau's treatise On the Duty\n                        of Civil
  Disobedience (1849). These ideas of individual\n                    resistance can
  be summarized in the words of Étienne de la\n                    Boétie: “Resolve
  no longer to serve and you will be\n                    free.” Anselme Bellegarrique
  would write (1850):\n                    “There are no tyrants, there are only slaves.”
  Non- cooperation, nonretaliation,\n                    nonviolent resistance, war
  resistance, boycott, and direct action are\n                    applications all
  derived from these principles.\n                        Political Doctrine.\n                     Anarchist
  thought exercised its main influence as a political\n                    doctrine.
  As such it is part of the history of socialist thought, of which\n                    it
  represents the libertarian and anti-Jacobin trend. Like socialism,\n                    anarchism
  is a product of the political and industrial revolutions. As a\n                    matter
  of fact the history of modern\n                     anarchist thought and anarchist
  movement is bound up since the\n                    middle of the nineteenth century
  with the history of the labor movement. It\n                    is strongly in-
  fluenced by Marxist ideas\n                    about the class struggle and the
  emphasis of the economic side of the\n                    emancipation of the laboring
  classes.Anarchism—in contrast with Marxian theory— rejects the\n                    theory
  of the political organization of the labor class with a view to the\n                    conquest
  of the state. It rejects pressure through the mechanism of parlia- mentary parties
  as well as\n                    dictatorship in the period of the revolution as
  instruments to achieve\n                    these ends. It objects to representative
  government and to parlia- mentary democracy because it denies\n                    that
  in a political sense one man should represent another, unless he\n                    is
  a delegate to represent a group in relation to a definite issue or\n                    form
  of activity, and is always subject to recall.Marx, and Engels too, defined anarchy
  as the final stage of socialism, i.e.,\n                    a classless and stateless
  society. Anarchism however regards the Marxian\n                    theory of the
  inevitability of the historical economic process,\n                    leading to
  the conquest of power and subsequently the\n                    “withering away
  of the state” as a fallacy and as uto- pian dialectics.Anarchism recognizes only
  regional differences and demands for every group\n                    the right
  of self-deter- mination in\n                    solidarity with all other associations
  of an economic or territorial order.\n                    Federalism is an essen-
  tial part of its\n                    doctrine. In place of the present state organization,
  anarchism would\n                    establish a federation of free communities
  which would be bound to one\n                    another by their common and social
  interests, and would arrange their\n                    affairs by mutual agreement
  and free contract.\n                        Theorists.\n                     The
  first systematic exposition is the po-\n                        litical treatise
  of William Godwin, An Enquiry\n                            con- cerning Political
  Justice and\n                        its Influence on General Virtue and Happiness
  (1793). The title is\n                    a good sum- mary of the content. The main
  claim\n                    of Godwin as founder of modern anarchism is that in Godwin's
  opin- ion all moral evils are caused by political\n                    institutions.
  A disciple of eighteenth-century philosophical ration- alism and belief in the perfectibility\n
  \                   of man, i.e., a continuous advance towards higher rationality,
  Godwin\n                    believed that men behaved irrationally because the conventional\n
  \                   institutions of society led them to stray from reason. Man's
  character\n                    depends on external cir- cumstances, and\n                    social
  prejudice and government should be abolished, as government\n                    constitutes
  the frequent source of crime, villainy, and injustice.\n                    Godwin
  questioned the legitimacy of every form of government and coercion,\n                    and
  envisaged a future of free enlightened cooperation of individuals,\n                    grouped
  in small communities.The importance Godwin attached to education, i.e., to the purpose
  of\n                    developing the child's autonomy, is common to most anarchist
  schools of\n                    thought. The emphasis on the influence of environment
  in the for- mation of character and in the shaping of\n                    human
  con- duct, was to be taken over by Robert\n                    Owen and de- veloped
  as an integral part of\n                    Owenite socialism. Godwin's anarchism
  rested on an absolute exaltation\n                    of the claim of individual
  conscience enlightened by reason, involving a\n                    repudiation of
  any duty of obedi- ence, save\n                    to the demands of reason. Through
  Shelley, who adopted his philosophy and\n                    who wrote to Godwin:
  “You are the regulator and former of my\n                    mind,” an- archism
  became a theme\n                    of world literature.If Godwin tried to persuade,
  Charles Fourier empha-\n                        sized the example of small communities
  (phalanstères), free and voluntary associations (communes socié-\n                        taires),
  mainly agricultural, without any authority\n                    and coercion, and
  with a variety of types of work suited for every\n                    person, corresponding
  to the natural variety of human desires. He analyzed\n                    the psychological
  con- ditions of work, and\n                    believed he had discovered the law
  of “attraction,” a\n                    permanent contribution to the problem of
  work and of the incentives and\n                    their rela- tions to it. Free
  experiments are\n                    an essential part of anti-authoritarian socialism.William
  Thompson, influenced by Godwin, Ben-\n                    tham, and Owen, advocated
  direct action by the pro- ducers, using trade unionism as a means for their own\n
  \                   emancipation without the help of the government. He devised
  a constructive\n                    plan for the emancipation of labor by establishing
  cooperative societies of\n                        produc- tion and thus constructing
  a new\n                    society.The system of Co-operative Industry accomplishes
  this, not by the\n                            vain search after foreign markets
  throughout the globe, no sooner\n                            found than over-stocked
  and glutted by the restless competition of\n                            the starving
  producers, but by the voluntary union of the\n                            industrious
  or productive classes, in such numbers as to afford a market to each other, by working
  together\n                                for each other, for the mutual supply,\n
  \                           directly by themselves, of all their most indispensable
  wants, in\n                            the way of food, clothing, dwelling, and
  furniture\n                        (Thompson, p. III).\n                    Nineteenth-century
  anarchism first received form and content from\n                    Pierre-Joseph
  Proudhon. The use of the words\n                    “anarchy” and “anarchist” in
  the\n                    nineteenth century goes back to Proudhon, who used\n                    “anarchy”
  for the first time in the sense of absence\n                    of sovereignty (What
  is Property?, 1840). Later\n                    Proudhon spoke, in his Solution
  du problème\n                        social, of the ideal republic as a positive\n
  \                       anarchy. “It is neither liberty, subordi- nated to order,
  as in a constitutional monarchy,\n                    nor liberty in presenting
  order. It is reciprocal liberty and not\n                    limited liberty; liberty
  is not the daughter but the\n                     mother of order” (Cole, I, 202).
  Proudhon's\n                    influence on subsequent anarchist thought has been
  threefold: (1) his\n                    attack on the Jacobin principle, his denunciation
  of the State, and his\n                    rejection of representative democ- racy;
  (2)\n                    his proposal to replace the State by groups of individuals,
  united for\n                    productive purposes; (3) his theory of federalism.
  According to Proudhon,\n                    economic and social exploitation was
  correlated with political\n                    oppression. Nothing is feasible by
  spontaneous initi- ative, independent actions of individuals and collectiv- ities
  as long as they are in the\n                    presence of this colossal power
  which is given to the State by\n                    centralization. Proudhon rejected
  a state corporation as advocated by\n                    Louis Blanc. Although he
  thought mainly in terms of small-scale economic\n                    activity, he
  envisaged for the future large industry and agriculture\n                    developed
  from association. Proudhon advocated a great central Credit\n                    Bank,
  an independent institution apart from the State, making through\n                    subsidiary
  branches interest-free ad- vances of\n                    capital, to ensure means
  of labor to each producer, or workers'\n                    organizations to ensure
  to each producer the full product of his labor.\n                    Products would
  be exchanged at cost value by means of labor checks\n                    based on
  the labor-time theory of value associated with Robert Owen and the\n                    Ricardian
  socialists. Proudhon called this system\n                    “mutualism.”Two outstanding
  representatives of anarchist indi-\n                        vidualism are Max Stirner
  and Benjamin Tucker. InDer Einzige und sein Eigenthum (1844; trans. as\n                        The
  Ego and his Own), Stirner, a philosopher and\n                    a social and political
  thinker, developed the view that law and the\n                    State deprived
  the individual of his uniqueness. As all forms of government\n                    arise
  from the principle that all right and all authority belong to the\n                    collectivity,
  it is indifferent who exercises the authority, for the\n                    collectivity
  is always above the individual. The State acts with violence\n                    and
  claims that its laws are sacred. He who affronts them is a criminal.\n                    Every
  man's wel- fare demands that a social life\n                    based solely on
  the welfare of the individual take the place of the\n                    State.
  The State exists through voluntary servitude. What do laws\n                    amount
  to if no one obeys them? What do orders amount to if nobody lets\n                    himself
  be ordered? The State is not imaginable without rulers and\n                    servitude;
  for the State must will to be the lord of all that it\n                    embraces,
  and this will is called the “will of the\n                    State.” The workers
  have the most enormous power in their\n                    hands and if they once
  became thoroughly conscious of it and used it,\n                    nothing would
  withstand them. The State rests on the slavery of labor. If\n                    labor
  becomes free, the State is lost.Benjamin R. Tucker rejected any communistic solu-\n
  \                   tion of the social problem as incompatible with the\n                    “sovereignty
  of the individual,” as postulated by theMichael Bakunin, a prolific but incoherent
  writer, developed his anarchist\n                    ideas from 1864 on. Starting
  from Hegel's idealism, Bakunin's philosophical\n                    ideas were molded
  by the humanism of Ludwig Feuerbach. Atheism became\n                    an essential
  part of his doctrine. He regarded the idea of God as\n                    fundamentally
  inconsistent with human freedom. With Bakunin, anarchist\n                    thought
  became linked with anarchist organizations and working-class\n                    movements,
  and became a political movement. His doctrine inspired socialist\n                    movements
  in France, Italy, Switzerland, and in Spain, where its\n                    influence
  lasted longest. Like Proudhon, Bakunin at-\n                        tacked the concept
  of the centralized state even when it\n                    appeared as the democratic
  representation of the people or as the\n                    instrument of a hitherto
  exploited class. He envisaged a revolution to\n                    expropriate capital
  and land, but not by the state, which to be able\n                    to fulfil
  its political and economic mission (as state- socialists advocate) would\n                    necessarily
  have to be very powerful and strongly concentrated. He foresaw\n                    even
  greater exploitation, and in the development of the modern great\n                    powers
  and in the growing influence of economic monopoly, the greatest\n                    danger
  for the future of Europe.Bakunin's anarchist ideas are most fully expressed in the\n
  \                   programs—mostly drafts—which he wrote for the secret\n                    societies
  he tried to organize. He was con-\n                    vinced that a small number
  of individuals, acting in common with the\n                    masses, could and
  should essentially influence the course of historic\n                    events.
  Bakunin's social theory is a critical application of anarchism with\n                    a
  view to changing the political and social system. He rejected\n                    Proudhon's
  mutualism as a solution of the social prob-\n                        lem, and also
  the belief in the possibility of eliminating\n                    capitalism by
  peaceful means. However, Proudhon's anti-Jacobin and\n                    federalist
  ideas influenced him, but he rejected every form of state\n                    socialism:I
  detest communism because it is the negation of liberty and I can\n                            conceive
  nothing human without liberty. I am no communist because\n                            communism
  concentrates and aims at the absorption of all powers of\n                            society;
  the radical extir\n                            pation of that principle of authority
  and guardianship\n                            of the state which under the pretext
  of moralizing and civi- lizing men, has hitherto\n                            enslaved,
  oppressed, exploited and depraved them\n                        (Bakunin [1873],
  p. 28; trans. G. D. H. Cole).\n                    He stood for the organization
  of society arranged from below upward on the\n                    basis of collective
  and social property, by way of free association.Bakunin, the great antagonist of
  Marx in the “First\n                    International” (1864), not only objected
  to the theory of the\n                    state and dictatorship but regarded the
  Marxian interpretation of Hegel's\n                    dialectic, that socialism
  would be the result of an inevitable,\n                    historically determined,
  scientific process, as a fallacy. He was very\n                    critical of the
  prospect that science would regulate human and social\n                    affairs,
  “the reign of scientific intelligence would be a\n                    despotism,
  more demoralizing and worse than any previous despotism, and\n                    resulting
  in a new class, a hierarchy of real and fictitious scientists,\n                    and
  the world would be divided between a minority in the name of\n                    science
  and an immense ignorant majority” (Archives Bakounine, II, 204).Peter Kropotkin,
  scientist, historian, and social re-\n                        former, contributed
  perhaps more then anyone else to the\n                    elaboration and propagation
  of anarchism. In his classic, anti-Darwinist,\n                    sociological
  work Mutual Aid: a Factor of Evolution\n                    (1902) he sets out to
  show that mutual aid is as important an aspect in\n                    nature and
  in society as the struggle for survival. The dominating\n                    importance
  of the principle of mutual aid appears also in the domain of\n                    ethics.
  Konrad Lorenz wrote that mutual aid is the only phylogenetical\n                    adapted
  mecha- nism of behavior. By combining\n                    his scientific and social
  aspirations, Kropotkin tried to find a scientific\n                    basis of
  anarchism but never found a very convincing one. The very\n                    basis
  of his faith is a belief in cooperativeness as a natural human\n                    quality.
  The process of individ-\n                    ualization, or “individuation” as modern\n
  \                   psychologists would call it, i.e., self-realization, will not
  lead to\n                    isolation, but to an intense and more universal col-\n
  \                       lective solidarity. He believed in the coordination of industry\n
  \                   and agriculture; small communities which would control the means
  of\n                    production and counteract the tendency of centralized mass
  production. He\n                        al- ways stressed the importance of the\n
  \                   institutes created by the workers themselves as cooperative
  societies\n                    and trade unions. After the Russian Revolution he
  stated (1919) that\n                    as long as the country was governed by a
  party dictatorship, the workers'\n                    and peasant councils lost
  their entire significance.Errico Malatesta, who spent a life of incessant revo-
  lutionary activity spreading anarchist propaganda in\n                    Europe
  and in America, was, like Kropotkin, an anarcho-communist. But while\n                    Kropotkin
  stressed theThe Russian Revolution developed initially on Bakuninist lines: the
  state\n                    and its institutions were destroyed and replaced by\n
  \                   “soviets,” i.e., councils of workers and peasants,\n                    who
  expropriated the factories and the land. These soviets, in which the\n                    constructive
  element of the revolution was embodied, disintegrated\n                    after
  the Bolsheviks had succeeded in founding a “rev- olutionary state” and a\n                    party
  dictatorship. The liqui- dation by the\n                    Red Army (March 1921)
  of the Commune of Kronstadt, which stood for\n                    “all power to
  the Soviets and not to the Party,”\n                    marked the end of the inde-
  pendent soviets.The most important historical example of an attempt to put anarchist\n
  \                   principles into practice was the in- dustrial\n                    and
  agricultural “collectivizations” during the first\n                    months of
  the Spanish Civil War. Within forty-\n                        eight hours of the
  uprising, on July 19, 1936, the whole\n                    economic and social life
  of Catalonia and many other parts of Spain was\n                    taken over by
  the syndicates. Fac- tories,\n                    railways, and workshops, as well
  as all social services, were run by\n                    workers' councils. The
  continu- ation of\n                    the armed struggle, the government control
  of production and finance, the\n                    counterrevolutionary policy
  of the communists after the Stalin\n                    intervention, the compromises
  made in the name of “victory\n                    over Franco,” e.g., the participation
  of the anarchists'\n                     leaders in the government, were all factors
  tending to\n                    undermine this kind of social reconstruction.In
  order to define the role played by anarchism in the light of the\n                    experience
  of a rapidly changing soci- ety, two\n                    different tendencies can
  be noticed. Since the defeat of the powerful\n                    anarchist movement
  in the Spanish Civil War, anarchist movements\n                    everywhere have
  declined and lost their impetus. But anarchist ideas\n                    have outlived
  their partisans and may still be of value as doctrines of\n                    social
  reconstruction. The state has changed its character. The\n                    laissez-faire
  state of the nineteenth century has developed into an ever\n                        in-
  creasing bureaucracy. In a growing\n                    process powerful political
  institutions and industrial monopolies are in- tertwined in an excessively centralized\n
  \                   structure not dreamed of by any anarchist thinker.The anarchist
  criticism of the state and of authority, far from being\n                    invalidated
  by this modern develop- ment,\n                    may be more relevant than when
  the theory was created. This may explain the\n                    growing interest
  in the 1960's in anarchist ideas. Kropotkin's ideal of a\n                        region-
  ally decentralized economy could\n                    be regarded at the time as
  rather utopian and irreconcilable with the\n                    economic and political
  trend of society. But the new developments in an age\n                    of cybernetic
  potentially un- limited\n                    technology could easily free society
  of work and want, to live in a world\n                    of plenty. The use of
  new sources of power may reduce the necessity of\n                        present-
  day, gigantic economic units,\n                    and may make the widest distribution
  of industry, agriculture, and culture\n                        possi- ble in the
  political as well as in\n                    the social field. This however would
  not guarantee automatically a de- creased authority, as new communications and\n
  \                       com- puter techniques could just as well\n                    produce
  a greater development of authority. In other words, such a\n                    trend
  to decentralization would only be realized if based on an\n                    interregional
  federation, in which the region, as defined by Lewis Mumford,\n                    is
  the basic configuration in human life, a permanent sphere of cultural\n                    influence,
  and a center of economic activity.General. The standard work on the history of anarchism
