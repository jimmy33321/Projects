- "            Slava Turyshev, a scientist at JPL, and his colleagues have thought
  \n"
- "            of a way to use the International Space Station (ISS) and two mini-satellites

- "            emitted by the two mini-satellites. Gravity bends the path of light
  \n"
- "            because it warps the space through which the light is passing. The

  \n"

  or later, the reign of Einstein, \n            like the reign of Newton before him,
  will come to an end. An upheaval \n            in the world of physics that will
  overthrow our notions of basic reality \n            is inevitable, most scientists
  believe, and currently a horse race \n            is underway between a handful
  of theories competing to be the successor \n            to the throne.In \n            the
  running are such mind-bending ideas as an 11-dimensional universe, \n            universal
  \"constants\" (such as the strength of gravity) that vary \n            over space
  and time and only remain truly fixed in an unseen 5th dimension, \n            infinitesimal
  vibrating strings as the fundamental constituents of \n            reality, and
  a fabric of space and time that's not smooth and continuous, \n            as Einstein
  believed, but divided into discrete, indivisible chunks \n            of vanishingly
  small size. Experiment will ultimately determine which \n            triumphs.Right:
  \n            According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, the sun's gravity
  \n            causes starlight to bend, shifting the apparent position of stars
  \n            in the sky. \n            A new concept for an experiment to test
  the predictions of Einstein's \n            relativity more precisely than ever
  before is being developed by scientists \n            at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
  (JPL). Their mission, which effectively \n            uses our solar system as a
  giant laboratory, would help narrow the \n            field of vying theories and
  bring us one step closer to the next revolution \n            in physics.A House

  SCIENCE NEWS delivery\n          It may not weigh heavily on most people's minds,
  but a great schism \n          has long plagued our fundamental understanding of
  the universe. Two \n          ways of explaining the nature and behavior of space,
  time, matter, and \n          energy currently exist: Einstein's relativity and
  the \"standard model\" \n          of quantum mechanics. Both are extremely successful.
  The Global Positioning \n          System (GPS), for instance, wouldn't be possible
  without the theory \n          of relativity. Computers, telecommunications, and
  the Internet, meanwhile, \n          are spin-offs of quantum mechanics. \n            But
  the two theories are like different languages, and no one is yet \n            sure
  how to translate between them. Relativity explains gravity and \n            motion
  by uniting space and time into a 4-dimensional, dynamic, elastic \n            fabric
  of reality called space-time, which is bent and warped by the \n            energy
  it contains. (Mass is one form of energy, so it creates gravity \n            by
  warping space-time.) Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, assumes \n            that
  space and time form a flat, immutable \"stage\" on which the drama \n            of
  several families of particles unfolds. These particles can move \n            both
  forward and backward in time (something relativity doesn't allow), \n            and
  the interactions between these particles explain the basic forces \n            of
  nature -- with the glaring exception of gravity. \n          Left: \n            Astronomers
  use the light-bending properties of gravity to view very \n            distant galaxies--such
  as the arc shapes in this image--in a technique \n            called \"gravitational
  lensing.\" [More]The stalemate between these two theories has gone on for decades.
  \n            Most scientists assume that somehow, eventually, a unifying theory
  \n            will be developed that subsumes the two, showing how the truths they
  \n            each contain can fit neatly within a single, all-encompassing framework
  \n            of reality. Such a \"Theory of Everything\" would profoundly affect
  \n            our knowledge of the birth, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe.\n
  \           Slava Turyshev, a scientist at JPL, and his colleagues have thought
  \n            of a way to use the International Space Station (ISS) and two mini-satellites
  \n            orbiting on the far side of the sun to test the theory of relativity
  \n            with unprecedented accuracy. Their concept, developed in part through
  \n            funding from NASA's Office of Biological and Physical Research, would
  \n            be so sensitive that it could reveal flaws in Einstein's theory, thus
  \n            providing the first hard data needed to distinguish which of the competing
  \n            Theories of Everything agree with reality and which are merely fancy
  \n            chalk-work.\n            The experiment, called Laser Astrometric
  Test Of Relativity (LATOR), \n            would look at how the sun's gravity deflects
  beams of laser light \n            emitted by the two mini-satellites. Gravity bends
  the path of light \n            because it warps the space through which the light
  is passing. The \n            standard analogy for this warping of space-time by
  gravity is to imagine \n            space as a flat sheet of rubber that stretches
  under the weight of \n            objects like the sun. The depression in the sheet
  would cause an object \n            (even a no-mass particle of light) passing nearby
  the sun to turn \n            slightly as it went by.In \n            fact, it was
  by measuring the bending of starlight by the sun during \n            a solar eclipse
  in 1919 that Sir Arthur Eddington first tested Einstein's \n            theory of
  general relativity. In cosmic terms, the sun's gravity is \n            fairly weak;
  the path of a beam of light skimming the edge of the \n            sun would only
  be bent by about 1.75 arcseconds (an arcsecond is 1/3600 \n            of a degree).
  Within the limits of accuracy of his measuring equipment, \n            Eddington
  showed that starlight did indeed bend by this amount -- \n            and in doing
  so effectively impeached Newton. \n            LATOR would measure this deflection
  with a billion (109) times the precision \n            of Eddington's experiment
  and 30,000 times the precision of the current \n            record-holder: a serendipitous
  measurement using signals from the \n            Cassini spacecraft on its way to
  explore Saturn.Above: \n            The curvature of space due to the sun's mass
  caused signals from the \n            Cassini probe to curve on their way to Earth.
  [More]\"I think [LATOR] would be quite an important advance for fundamental \n            physics,\"
  says Clifford Will, a professor of physics at Washington \n            University
  who has made major contributions to post-Newtonian physics \n            and is
  not directly involved with LATOR. \"We should continue to try \n            to press
  for more accuracy in testing general relativity, simply because \n            any
  kind of deviation would mean that there's new physics that we \n            were
  not aware of before.\"Solar laboratory\n            The experiment would work like
  this: Two small satellites, each about \n            one meter wide, would be launched
  into an orbit circling the sun at \n            roughly the same distance as Earth.
  This pair of mini-satellites would \n            orbit more slowly than Earth does,
  so about 17 months after launch, \n            the mini-satellites and Earth would
  be on opposite sides of the sun. \n            Even though the two satellites would
  be about 5 million km apart, \n            the angle between them as viewed from
  Earth would be tiny, only about \n            1 degree. Together, the two satellites
  and Earth would form a skinny \n            triangle, with laser beams along its
  sides, and one of those beams \n            passing close to the sun.Above: \n            A
  schematic diagram of the proposed LATOR mission.Turyshev plans to measure the angle
  between the two \n            satellites using an interferometer mounted on the
  ISS. An interferometer \n            is a device that catches and combines beams
  of light. By measuring \n            how waves of light from the two mini-satellites
  \"interfere\" with each \n            other, the interferometer can measure the
  angle between the satellites \n            with extraordinary precision: about 10
  billionths \n            of an arcsecond, or 0.01 µas (micro-arcseconds). When the
  precision \n            of the other parts of the LATOR design are considered, this
  gives \n            an overall accuracy for measuring how much gravity bends the
  laser \n            beam of about 0.02 µas for a single measurement. \"Using the
  ISS gives us a few advantages,\" Turyshev \n            explains. \"For one, it's
  above the distortions of Earth's atmosphere, \n            and it's also large enough
  to let us place the two lenses of the interferometer \n            far apart (one
  lens on each end of the solar panel truss), which improves \n            the resolution
  and accuracy of the results.\" Left: \n            The interferometer will be mounted
  to the solar-panel truss \n            of the ISS, which automatically rotates to
  continuously face the sun. \n            Image courtesy Slava Turyshev.The 0.02
  µas accuracy of LATOR is good enough to reveal deviations \n            from Einstein's
  relativity predicted by the aspiring Theories of Everything, \n            which
  range from roughly 0.5 to 35 µas. Agreement with LATOR's \n            measurements
  would be a major boost for any of these theories. But \n            if no deviation
  from Einstein is found even by LATOR, most of the \n            current contenders--along
  with their 11 dimensions, pixellated space, \n            and inconstant constants--will
  suffer a fatal blow and \"pass on\" to \n            that great dusty library stack
  in the sky.\n            Because the mission requires only existing technologies,
  Turyshev \n            says LATOR could be ready to fly as soon as 2009 or 2010.
  So it may \n            not be too long before the stalemate in physics is broken
  and a new \n            theory of gravity, space, and time takes the throne.Web

  \n            like the reign of Newton before him, will come to an end. An upheaval
  \n            in the world of physics that will overthrow our notions of basic reality
  \n            is inevitable, most scientists believe, and currently a horse race
  \n            is underway between a handful of theories competing to be the successor
  \n            to the throne.In \n            the running are such mind-bending ideas
  as an 11-dimensional universe, \n            universal \"constants\" (such as the
  strength of gravity) that vary \n            over space and time and only remain
  truly fixed in an unseen 5th dimension, \n            infinitesimal vibrating strings
  as the fundamental constituents of \n            reality, and a fabric of space
  and time that's not smooth and continuous, \n            as Einstein believed, but
  divided into discrete, indivisible chunks \n            of vanishingly small size.
  Experiment will ultimately determine which \n            triumphs.Right: \n            According
  to Einstein's theory of general relativity, the sun's gravity \n            causes
  starlight to bend, shifting the apparent position of stars \n            in the
  sky. \n            A new concept for an experiment to test the predictions of Einstein's
  \n            relativity more precisely than ever before is being developed by scientists
  \n            at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Their mission, which effectively
  \n            uses our solar system as a giant laboratory, would help narrow the
