- "                Iraq, country of southwestern Asia.During ancient times the lands
  now comprising Iraq were known as Mesopotamia (“Land Between the Rivers”), a region
  whose extensive alluvial plains gave rise to some of the world’s earliest civilizations,
  including those of Sumer, Akkad, Babylon, and Assyria. This wealthy region, constituting
  much of what is called the Fertile Crescent, later became a valuable part of larger
  imperial polities, including sundry Persian, Greek, and Roman dynasties, and after
  the 7th century became a central and integral part of the Islamic world. Iraq’s
  capital, Baghdad, became the capital of the ʿAbbāsid Caliphate in the 8th century.
  The modern nation-state of Iraq was created following World War I (1914–18) from
  the Ottoman provinces of Baghdad, Al-Baṣrah, and Mosul and derives its name from
  the Arabic term used in the premodern period to describe a region that roughly corresponded
  to Mesopotamia (ʿIrāq ʿArabī, “Arabian Iraq”) and modern northwestern Iran (ʿIrāq
  ʿajamī, “foreign [i.e., Persian] Iraq”).Iraq gained formal independence in 1932
  but remained subject to British imperial influence during the next quarter century
  of turbulent monarchical rule. Political instability on an even greater scale followed
  the overthrow of the monarchy in 1958, but the installation of an Arab nationalist
  and socialist regime—the Baʿth Party—in a bloodless coup 10 years later brought
  new stability. With proven oil reserves second in the world only to those of Saudi
  Arabia, the regime was able to finance ambitious projects and development plans
  throughout the 1970s and to build one of the largest and best-equipped armed forces
  in the Arab world. The party’s leadership, however, was quickly assumed by Ṣaddām
  Ḥussein, a flamboyant and ruthless autocrat who led the country into disastrous
  military adventures—the Iran-Iraq War (1980–88) and the Persian Gulf War (1990–91).
  These conflicts left the country isolated from the international community and financially
  and socially drained, but through unprecedented coercion directed at major sections
  of the population—particularly the country’s disfranchised Kurdish minority and
  Shīʿite majority—Ṣaddām himself was able to maintain a firm hold on power into the
  21st century. He and his regime were toppled in 2003 during the Iraq War.LandIraq
  is one of the easternmost countries of the Arab world, located at about the same
  latitude as the southern United States. It is bordered to the north by Turkey, to
  the east by Iran, to the west by Syria and Jordan, and to the south by Saudi Arabia
  and Kuwait. Iraq has 12 miles (19 km) of coastline along the northern end of the
  Persian Gulf, giving it a tiny sliver of territorial sea. Followed by Jordan, it
  is thus the Middle Eastern state with the least access to the sea and offshore sovereignty.ReliefMiddle
  East: IraqEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Iraq’s topography can be divided into four
  physiographic regions: the alluvial plains of the central and southeastern parts
  of the country; Al-Jazīrah (Arabic: “the Island”), an upland region in the north
  between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers; deserts in the west and south; and the
  highlands in the northeast. Each of these regions extends into neighbouring countries,
  although the alluvial plains lie largely within Iraq.Alluvial plainsʿArab, Shaṭṭ
  Al-Diane Rawson/Photo ResearchersThe plains of lower Mesopotamia extend southward
  some 375 miles (600 km) from Balad on the Tigris and Al-Ramādī on the Euphrates
  to the Persian Gulf. They cover more than 51,000 square miles (132,000 square km),
  almost one-third of the country’s area, and are characterized by low elevation,
  below 300 feet (100 metres), and poor natural drainage. Large areas are subject
  to widespread seasonal flooding, and there are extensive marshlands, some of which
  dry up in the summer to become salty wastelands. Near Al-Qurnah, where the Tigris
  and Euphrates converge to form the Shatt al-Arab, there are still some inhabited
  marshes. The alluvial plains contain extensive lakes. The swampy Lake Al-Ḥammār
  (Hawr al-Ḥammār) extends 70 miles (110 km) from Al-Baṣrah (Basra) to Sūq al-Shuyūkh;
  its width varies from 8 to 15 miles (13 to 25 km).Al-JazīrahEuphrates River: Euphrates
  River, north-central Iraq© Nik WheelerNorth of the alluvial plains, between the
  Tigris and the Euphrates rivers, is the arid Al-Jazīrah plateau. Its most prominent
  hill range is the Sinjār Mountains, whose highest peak reaches an elevation of 4,448
  feet (1,356 metres). The main watercourse is the Wadi Al-Tharthār, which runs southward
  for 130 miles (210 km) from the Sinjār Mountains to the Tharthār (Salt) Depression.
  Milḥat Ashqar is the largest of several salt flats (or sabkhahs) in the region.DesertsWestern
  and southern Iraq is a vast desert region covering some 64,900 square miles (168,000
  square km), almost two-fifths of the country. The western desert, an extension of
  the Syrian Desert, rises to elevations above 1,600 feet (490 metres). The southern
  desert is known as Al-Ḥajarah in the western part and as Al-Dibdibah in the east.
  Al-Ḥajarah has a complex topography of rocky desert, wadis, ridges, and depressions.
  Al-Dibdibah is a more sandy region with a covering of scrub vegetation. Elevation
  in the southern desert averages between 300 and 1,200 feet (100 to 400 metres).
  A height of 3,119 feet (951 metres) is reached at Mount ʿUnayzah (ʿUnāzah) at the
  intersection of the borders of Jordan, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. The deep Wadi Al-Bāṭin
  runs 45 miles (75 km) in a northeast-southwest direction through Al-Dibdibah. It
  has been recognized since 1913 as the boundary between western Kuwait and Iraq.The
  northeastThe mountains, hills, and plains of northeastern Iraq occupy some 35,500
  square miles (92,000 square km), about one-fifth of the country. Of this area only
  about one-fourth is mountainous; the remainder is a complex transition zone between
  mountain and lowland. The ancient kingdom of Assyria was located in this area. North
  and northeast of the Assyrian plains and foothills is Kurdistan, a mountainous region
  that extends into Turkey and Iran.The relief of northeastern Iraq rises from the
  Tigris toward the Turkish and Iranian borders in a series of rolling plateaus, river
  basins, and hills until the high mountain ridges of Iraqi Kurdistan, associated
  with the Taurus and Zagros mountains, are reached. These mountains are aligned northwest
  to southeast and are separated by river basins where human settlement is possible.
  The mountain summits have an average elevation of about 8,000 feet (2,400 metres),
  rising to 10,000–11,000 feet (3,000–3,300 metres) in places. There, along the Iran-Iraq
  border, is the country’s highest point, Ghundah Zhur, which reaches 11,834 feet
  (3,607 metres). The region is heavily dissected by numerous tributaries of the Tigris,
  notably the Great and Little Zab rivers and the Diyālā and ʿUẓaym (Adhaim) rivers.
  These streams weave tortuously south and southwest, cutting through ridges in a
  number of gorges, notably the Rū Kuchūk gorge, northeast of Barzān, and the Bēkma
  gorge, west of Rawāndūz town. The highest mountain ridges contain the only forestland
  in Iraq.DrainageThe Tigris-Euphrates river systemTigris RiverRobert Harding Picture
  Library/SuperStockIraq is drained by the Tigris-Euphrates river system, although
  less than half of the Tigris-Euphrates basin lies in the country. Both rivers rise
  in the Armenian highlands of Turkey, where they are fed by melting winter snow.
  The Tigris flows 881 miles (1,417 km) and the Euphrates 753 miles (1,212 km) through
  Iraq before they join near Al-Qurnah to form the Shatt al-Arab, which flows another
  68 miles (109 km) into the Persian Gulf. The Tigris, all of whose tributaries are
  on its left (east) bank, runs close to the high Zagros Mountains, from which it
  receives a number of important tributaries, notably the Great Zab, the Little Zab,
  and the Diyālā. As a result, the Tigris can be subject to devastating floods, as
  evidenced by the many old channels left when the river carved out a new course.
  The period of maximum flow of the Tigris is from March to May, when more than two-fifths
  of the annual total discharge may be received. The Euphrates, whose flow is roughly
  50 percent greater than that of the Tigris, receives no large tributaries in Iraq.Irrigation
  and canalsMany dams are needed on the rivers and their tributaries to control flooding
  and permit irrigation. Iraq has giant irrigation projects at Bēkma, Bādūsh, and
  Al-Fatḥah. In the late 1970s and early ’80s, Iraq completed a large-scale project
  that connected the Tigris and Euphrates. A canal emerges from the Tigris near Sāmarrāʾ
  and continues southwest to Lake Al-Tharthār, and another extends from the lake to
  the Euphrates near Al-Ḥabbāniyyah. This connection is crucial because in years of
  drought—aggravated by more recent upstream use of Euphrates water by Turkey and
  Syria—the river level is extremely low. In 1990 Syria and Iraq reached an agreement
  to share the water on the basis of 58 percent to Iraq and 42 percent to Syria of
  the total that enters Syria. Turkey, for its part, unilaterally promised to secure
  an annual minimum flow at its border with Syria. There is no tripartite agreement.Following
  the Persian Gulf War, the Iraqi government dedicated considerable resources to digging
  two large canals in the south of the country, with the apparent goal of improving
  irrigation and agricultural drainage. There is evidence, however, that these channels
  were also used to drain large parts of Iraq’s southern marshlands, from which rebel
  forces had carried out attacks against government forces. The first was reportedly
  designed to irrigate some 580 square miles (1,500 square km) of desert. The vast
  operation to create it produced a canal roughly 70 miles (115 km) long between Dhī
  Qār and Al-Baṣrah governorates. The second, an even grander scheme, was reportedly
  designed to irrigate an area some 10 times larger than the first. This canal, completed
  in 1992, extends from Al-Yūsufiyyah, 25 miles (40 km) south of Baghdad, to Al-Baṣrah,
  a total of some 350 miles (565 km).The two projects eventually drained some nine-tenths
  of Iraq’s southern marshes, once the largest wetlands system in the Middle East.
  Much of the drained area rapidly turned to arid salt flats. Following the start
  of the Iraq War in 2003, some parts of those projects were dismantled, but experts
  estimated that rehabilitation of the marshes would be impossible without extensive
  efforts and the expenditure of great resources.SoilsThe desert regions have poorly
  developed soils of coarse texture containing many stones and unweathered rock fragments.
  Plant growth is limited because of aridity, and the humus content is low. In northwestern
  Iraq, soils vary considerably: some regions with steep slopes are badly eroded,
  while the river valleys and basins contain some light fertile soils. In northwest
  Al-Jazīrah, there is an area of potentially fertile soils similar to those found
  in much of the Fertile Crescent. Lowland Iraq is covered by heavy alluvial soils,
  with some organic content and a high proportion of clays, suitable for cultivation
  and for use as a building material.Salinity, caused in part by overirrigation, is
  a serious problem that affects about two-thirds of the land; as a result, large
  areas of agricultural land have had to be abandoned. A high water table and poor
  drainage, coupled with high rates of evaporation, cause alkaline salts to accumulate
  at or near the surface in sufficient quantities to limit agricultural productivity.
  Reversing the effect is a difficult and lengthy process.Heavy soil erosion in parts
  of Iraq, some of it induced by overgrazing and deforestation, leaves soils exposed
  to markedly seasonal rainfall. The Tigris-Euphrates river system has thus created
  a large alluvial deposit at its mouth, so that the Persian Gulf coast is much farther
  south than in Babylonian times.ClimateIraq has two climatic provinces: the hot,
  arid lowlands, including the alluvial plains and the deserts; and the damper northeast,
  where the higher elevation produces cooler temperatures. In the northeast cultivation
  fed by precipitation is possible, but elsewhere irrigation is essential.In the lowlands
  there are two seasons, summer and winter, with short transitional periods between
  them. Summer, which lasts from May to October, is characterized by clear skies,
  extremely high temperatures, and low relative humidity; no precipitation occurs
  from June through September. In Baghdad, July and August mean daily temperatures
  are about 95 °F (35 °C), and summer temperatures of 123 °F (51 °C) have been recorded.
  The diurnal temperatures range in summer is considerable.In winter the paths of
  westerly atmospheric depressions crossing the Middle East shift southward, bringing
  rain to southern Iraq. Annual totals vary considerably from year to year, but mean
  annual precipitation in the lowlands ranges from about 4 to 7 inches (100 to 180
  mm); nearly all of this occurs between November and April.Winter in the lowlands
  lasts from December to February. Temperatures are generally mild, although extremes
  of hot and cold, including frosts, can occur. Winter temperatures in Baghdad range
  from about 35 to 60 °F (2 to 15 °C).In the northeast the summer is shorter than
  in the lowlands, lasting from June to September, and the winter considerably longer.
  The summer is generally dry and hot, but average temperatures are some 5–10 °F (3–6
  °C) cooler than those of lowland Iraq. Winters can be cold because of the region’s
  high relief and the influence of northeasterly winds that bring continental air
  from Central Asia. In Mosul (Al-Mawṣil), January temperatures range between 24 and
  63 °F (−4 and 17 °C); readings as low as 12 °F (−11 °C) have been recorded.In the
  foothills of the northeast, annual precipitation of 12 to 22 inches (300 to 560
  mm), enough to sustain good seasonal pasture, is typical. Precipitation may exceed
  40 inches (1,000 mm) in the mountains, much of which falls as snow. As in the lowlands,
  little rain falls during the summer.A steady northerly and northwesterly summer
  wind, the shamāl, affects all of Iraq. It brings extremely dry air, so hardly any
  clouds form, and the land surface is thus heated intensively by the sun. Another
  wind, the sharqī (Arabic: “easterly”), blows from the south and southeast during
  early summer and early winter; it is often accompanied by dust storms. Dust storms
  occur throughout Iraq during most of the year and may rise to great height in the
  atmosphere. They are particularly frequent in summer, with five or six striking
  central Iraq in July, the peak of the season.Plant and animal lifeVegetation in
  Iraq reflects the dominant influence of drought. Some Mediterranean and alpine plant
  species thrive in the mountains of Kurdistan, but the open oak forests that formerly
  were found there have largely disappeared. Hawthorns, junipers, terebinths, and
  wild pears grow on the lower mountain slopes. A steppe region of open, treeless
  vegetation is located in the area extending north and northeast from the Ḥamrīn
  Mountains up to the foothills and lower slopes of the mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan.
  A great variety of herbs and shrubs grow in that region. Most belong to the sage
  and daisy families: mugwort (Artemisis vulgaris), goosefoot, milkweed, thyme, and
  various rhizomic plants are examples. There also are many different grasses. Toward
  the riverine lowlands many other plants appear, including storksbill and plantain.
  Willows, tamarisks, poplars, licorice plants, and bulrushes grow along the banks
  of the lower Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The juice of the licorice plant is extracted
  for commercial purposes. Dozens of varieties of date palm flourish throughout southern
  Iraq, where the date palm dominates the landscape. The lakesides and marshlands
  support many varieties of reeds, sedges, pimpernels, vetches, and geraniums. By
  contrast, vegetation in the desert regions is sparse, with tamarisk, milfoil, and
  various plants of the genera Ziziphus and Salsola being characteristic.Euphrates
  River: marshland© Nik WheelerBirds are easily the most conspicuous form of wildlife.
  There are many resident species, though the effect of large-scale drainage of the
  southern wetlands on migrants and seasonal visitors—which were once numerous—has
  not been fully determined. The lion, oryx, ostrich, and wild ass have become extinct
  in Iraq. Wolves, foxes, jackals, hyenas, wild pigs, and wildcats are found, as well
  as many small animals such as martens, badgers, otters, porcupines, and muskrats.
  The Arabian sand gazelle survives in certain remote desert locations. Rivers, streams,
  and lakes are well stocked with a variety of fish, notably carp, various species
  of Barbus, catfish, and loach. In common with other regions of the Middle East,
  Iraq is a breeding ground for the unwelcome desert locust.PeopleModern Iraq, created
  by combining three separate Ottoman provinces in the aftermath of World War I, is
  one of the most religiously and ethnically diverse societies in the Middle East.
  Although Iraq’s communities generally coexisted peacefully, fault lines between
  communities deepened in the 20th century as a succession of authoritarian regimes
  ruled by exploiting tribal, sectarian, and ethnic divisions.Ethnic groupsThe ancient
  Semitic peoples of Iraq, the Babylonians and Assyrians, and the non-Semitic Sumerians
  were long ago assimilated by successive waves of immigrants. The Arab conquests
  of the 7th century brought about the Arabization of central and southern Iraq. A
  mixed population of Kurds and Arabs inhabit a transition zone between those areas
  and Iraqi Kurdistan in the northeast. Roughly two-thirds of Iraq’s people are Arabs,
  about one-fourth are Kurds, and the remainder consists of small minority groups.ArabsIraq’s
  Arab population is divided between Sunni Muslims and the more numerous Shīʿites.
  These groups, however, are for the most part ethnically and linguistically homogenous,
  and—as is common throughout the region—both value family relations strongly. Many
  Arabs, in fact, identify more strongly with their family or tribe (an extended,
  patrilineal group) than with national or confessional affiliations, a significant
  factor contributing to ongoing difficulties in maintaining a strong central government.
  This challenge is amplified by the numerical size of many extended kin groups—tribal
  units may number thousands or tens of thousands of members—and the consequent political
  and economic clout they wield. Tribal affiliation among Arab groups has continued
  to play an important role in Iraqi politics, and even in areas where tribalism has
  eroded with time (such as major urban centres), family bonds have remained close.
  Several generations may live in a single household (although this is more common
  among rural families), and family-owned-and-operated businesses are the standard.
  Such households tend to be patriarchal, with the eldest male leading the family.KurdsKurdish
  settlementEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Although estimates of their precise numbers
  vary, the Kurds are reckoned to be the fourth largest ethnic group in the Middle
  East, following Arabs, Turks, and Persians. There are important Kurdish minorities
  in Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria, and Iraq’s Kurds are concentrated in the relatively
  inaccessible mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan, which is roughly contiguous with Kurdish
  regions in those other countries. Kurds constitute a separate and distinctive cultural
  group. They are mostly Sunni Muslims who speak one of two dialects of the Kurdish
  language, an Indo-European language closely related to Modern Persian. They have
  a strong tribal structure and distinctive costume, music, and dance.The Kurdish
  people were thwarted in their ambitions for statehood after World War I, and the
  Iraqi Kurds have since resisted inclusion in the state of Iraq. At various times
  the Kurds have been in undisputed control of large tracts of territory. Attempts
  to reach a compromise with the Kurds in their demands for autonomy, however, have
  ended in failure, owing partly to government pressure and partly to the inability
  of Kurdish factional groups to maintain a united front against successive Iraqi
  governments. From 1961 to 1975, aided by military support from Iran, they were intermittently
  in open rebellion against the Iraqi government, as they were during the Iran-Iraq
  War in the 1980s and again, supported largely by the United States, throughout the
  1990s.After its rise to power, the Baʿth regime of Ṣaddām Ḥussein consistently tried
  to extend its control into Kurdish areas through threats, coercion, violence, and,
  at times, the forced internal transfer of large numbers of Kurds. Intermittent Kurdish
  rebellions in the last quarter of the 20th century killed tens of thousands of Kurds—both
  combatants and noncombatants—at the hands of government forces and on various occasions
  forced hundreds of thousands of Kurds to flee to neighbouring Iran and Turkey. Government
  attacks were violent and ruthless and included the use of chemical weapons against
  Kurdish civilians; such incidents took place at the village of Ḥalabjah and elsewhere
  in 1988.Following a failed Kurdish uprising in the wake of the Persian Gulf War,
  the United States and other members of the coalition that it led against Iraq established
  a “safe haven” for the Kurds in an area north of latitude 36° N that was under the
  protection of the international community. Thereafter the Kurds were largely autonomous.
  Kurdish autonomy is upheld in the 2005 constitution, which designates Kurdistan
  as an autonomous federal region.Other minoritiesSmall communities of Turks, Turkmen,
  and Assyrians survive in northern Iraq. The Lur, a group speaking an Iranian language,
  live near the Iranian border. In addition, a small number of Armenians are found
  predominantly in Baghdad and in pockets throughout the north.LanguagesMore than
  three-fourths of the people speak Arabic, the official language, which has several
  major dialects; these are generally mutually intelligible, but significant variations
  do exist within the country, which makes spoken parlance between some groups (and
  with Arabic-speaking groups in adjacent countries) difficult. Modern Standard Arabic—the
  benchmark of literacy—is taught in schools, and most Arabs and many non-Arabs, even
  those who lack schooling, are able to understand it. Roughly one-fifth of the population
  speaks Kurdish, in one of its two main dialects. Kurdish is the official language
  in the Kurdish Autonomous Region in the north. A number of other languages are spoken
  by smaller ethnic groups, including Turkish, Turkmen, Azerbaijanian, and Syriac.
  Persian, once commonly spoken, is now seldom heard. Bilingualism is fairly common,
  particularly among minorities who are conversant in Arabic. English is widely used
  in commerce.ReligionIraq is predominantly a Muslim country, in which the two major
  sects of Islam are represented more equally than in any other state. Slightly more
  than half (and according to some sources as many as three-fifths) of the population
  are Shīʿite, and about two-fifths are Sunni. Largely for political reasons, the
  government has not maintained careful statistics on the relative proportion of the
  Sunni and Shīʿite populations. Shīʿites are almost exclusively Arab (with some Turkmen
  and Kurds), while Sunnis are divided mainly between Arabs and Kurds but include
  other, smaller groups, such as Azerbaijanis and Turkmen.SunnisFrom the inception
  of the Iraqi state in 1920 until the fall of the government of Ṣaddām Ḥussein in
  2003, the ruling elites consisted mainly—although not exclusively—of minority Sunni
  Arabs. Most Sunni Arabs follow the Ḥanafī school of jurisprudence and most Kurds
  the Shāfiʿī school, although this distinction has lost the meaning that it had in
  earlier times.ShīʿitesIraq’s Shīʿites, like their coreligionists in Iran, follow
  the Ithnā ʿAsharī, or Twelver, rite, and, despite the preeminence of Iran as a Shīʿite
  Islamic republic, Iraq has traditionally been the physical and spiritual centre
  of Shīʿism in the Islamic world. Shīʿism’s two most important holy cities, Al-Najaf
  and Karbalāʾ, are located in southern Iraq, as is Al-Kūfah, sanctified as the site
  of the assassination of ʿAlī, the fourth caliph, in the 7th century. Sāmarrāʾ, farther
  north, near Baghdad, is also of great cultural and religious significance to Shīʿites
  as the site of the life and disappearance of the 12th, and eponymous, imam, Muḥammad
  al-Mahdī al-Ḥujjah. In premodern times southern and eastern Iraq formed a cultural
  and religious meeting place between the Arab and Persian Shīʿite worlds, and religious
  scholars moved freely between the two regions. Even until relatively recent times,
  large numbers of notable Iranian scholars could be found studying or teaching in
  the great madrasahs (religious schools) in Al-Najaf and Karbalāʾ; the Iranian cleric
  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, for instance, spent many years lecturing at Al-Najaf
  while in exile. Although Shīʿites constituted the majority of the population, Iraq’s
  Sunnī rulers gave preferential treatment to influential Sunnī tribal networks, and
  Sunnīs dominated the military officer corps and civil service. Shīʿites remained
  politically and economically marginalized until the fall of Ṣaddām Ḥussein’s regime.
  Since the transition to elective government, Shīʿite factions have wielded significant
  political power.Religious minoritiesFollowers of other religions include Christians
  and even smaller groups of Yazīdīs, Mandaeans, Jews, and Bahāʾīs. (See Mandaeanism;
  Bahāʾī faith.) The nearly extinct Jewish community traces its origins to the Babylonian
  Exile (586–516 bc). Jews formerly constituted a small but significant minority and
  were largely concentrated in or around Baghdad, but, with the rise of Zionism, anti-Jewish
  feelings became widespread. This tension eventually led to the massive Farhūd pogrom
  of June 1941. With the establishment of Israel in 1948, most Jews emigrated there
  or elsewhere. The Christian communities are chiefly descendants of the ancient population
  that was not converted to Islam in the 7th century. They are subdivided among various
  sects, including Nestorians (Assyrians), Chaldeans—who broke with the Nestorians
  in the 16th century and are now affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church—and members
  of the Syriac Orthodox  and Eastern Orthodox churches. About one million Christians
  lived in Iraq when the Iraq War began. International organizations estimate that
  more than half have left the country since then, mostly to escape poverty and violence
  by Muslim extremists.Settlement patternsIraq has a relatively low population density
  overall, but, in the fertile lowlands and the cities, densities are nearly four
  times the national average.Rural settlementThe distribution of towns and villages
  in Iraq follows basic patterns established thousands of years ago. Although the
  proportion of urban dwellers has risen over time, about one-third of Iraqis still
  live in rural areas. Today several thousand villages and hamlets are scattered unevenly
  throughout the two-thirds of Iraq that is permanently settled. The greatest concentration
  of villages is in the valleys and lowlands around the Tigris and Euphrates. Most
  have between 100 and 2,000 houses, traditionally clustered tightly for defensive
  purposes. Their populations are engaged almost exclusively in agriculture, although
  essential services are located in the larger villages.Villages in the foothills
  and mountains of the largely Kurdish northeast tend to be smaller and more isolated
  than those of lowland Iraq, which befits a lifestyle that is based on animal husbandry
  and only rarely on agriculture. The arid and semiarid areas in the west and south
  have sparse populations. The arid regions, along with the extensive Al-Jazīrah region
  northwest of Baghdad, were traditionally inhabited by nomadic Bedouin tribes, but
  few of these people remain in Iraq. Another lifestyle under threat is that of the
  Shīʿite marsh dwellers (Madan) of southern Iraq. They traditionally have lived in
  reed dwellings built on brushwood foundations or sandspits, but the damage done
  to the marshes in the 1990s has largely undermined their way of living. Rice, fish,
  and edible rushes have been staples, supplemented by products of the water buffalo.Urban
  settlementcitadelDiane Rawson/Photo ResearchersMore than two-thirds of Iraq’s population
  are urban dwellers, and almost two-fifths of those are concentrated in the five
  largest cities: Baghdad, Al-Baṣrah, Mosul, Arbīl, and Al-Sulaymāniyyah. There are
  also a considerable number of small towns, many of which are market centres, provincial
  capitals, or the headquarters of smaller local government districts. Attempts to
  stimulate the growth of selected small towns have had only modest success, and government
  efforts to stem the tide of people departing rural areas, through agricultural reform
  and other measures, have largely failed.BaghdadKarkh, Al-Steve McCurry/Magnum PhotosFor
  a variety of reasons, rural migrants have been particularly drawn to Baghdad, the
  country’s political, economic, and communications hub. First, to minimize the danger
  of riots in the capital city, the Baʿth regime—in addition to a variety of security
  measures—made special efforts to maintain a minimal level of public services, even
  in the poorest neighbourhoods. This was especially important after the UN imposed
  an extended embargo on Iraqi trade in response to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990,
  making food rationing more necessary than ever before. Distributing rations was
  more efficient in the capital area. Second, chances for employment typically have
  been better in Baghdad than in other cities. This was true as early as the 1930s,
  when migrants began to move to the city. Since that time, Shīʿite Arabs from the
  south have been the largest migrant group in the city, a trend that was enhanced
  during the Iran-Iraq War as many refugees fled the southern war zones. Efforts to
  limit this influx, and even to reverse it, met with only limited success, and, by
  the beginning of the 21st century, Shīʿite Arabs represented a majority in the capital.
  The poor Shīʿite-Arab Al-Thawrah (“Revolution”) quarter—known informally since 2003
  as Ṣadr City after Muḥammad Ṣādiq al-Ṣadr, a murdered Shīʿite cleric—alone houses
  more than a million people. Prior to the Iraq War, many Baghdad neighbourhoods contained
  a mix of Sunnī and Shiʿīte residents. These neighbourhoods became homogeneous as
  residents moved to safer areas amid the sectarian bloodshed that peaked around 2006.
  It is estimated that one-fifth of the country’s people live in the governorate of
  Baghdad, almost all of them in the city itself.It is no coincidence that Baghdad’s
  celebrated predecessors, Babylon and the Sāsānian capital, Ctesiphon, were located
  in the same general region. Baghdad, itself a city of legend, is located at the
  heart of what has long been a rich agricultural region, and the modern city is the
  undisputed commercial, manufacturing, and service capital of Iraq. Its growth, however,
  has necessitated costly projects, including elaborate flood-prevention schemes completed
  largely in the 1950s, the rehousing of hundreds of thousands of inhabitants of squalid
  shantytowns (ṣarīfahs) in the 1960s (and, on a much smaller scale, in 1979–80),
  and the construction of major domestic water and sewerage projects. The city was
  damaged during both the Persian Gulf War and the Iraq War and required major reconstruction
  of all parts of the infrastructure.Regional centresAl-Baṣrah, on the west bank of
  the Shatt al-Arab and formerly Iraq’s main port, is the centre of its southern petroleum
  sector and the hub of the country’s date cultivation. One of the great cities of
  Islamic history and heritage, it was badly damaged and largely depopulated during
  the Iran-Iraq War and, though partially reconstructed following that conflict, again
  suffered during the Persian Gulf War and subsequent fighting between Shīʿite rebels
  and government forces. Much of the city’s infrastructure (sewerage and potable water
  and health care facilities) remained in a state of disarray, with dire results for
  public health. Al-Baṣrah’s function as a port has been taken over by Umm Qaṣr, a
  small deepwater port on the gulf.Iraq’s third city, though now its second largest
  in terms of population, is Mosul, which is situated on the Tigris near the ruins
  of the ancient Assyrian capital of Nineveh. Mosul is the centre for the upper Tigris
  basin, specializing in processing and marketing agricultural and animal products.
  It has grown rapidly, partly as a result of the influx of Kurdish refugees fleeing
  government repression in Iraqi Kurdistan. By the end of the 1990s, Mosul too had
  suffered from government neglect, and, relative to Baghdad, its infrastructure and
  health care facilities were in poor condition.Demographic trendsIraq has the fourth
  largest population in the Middle East, after Iran, Egypt, and Turkey. Yet demographic
  information since 1980 has been difficult to obtain and interpret, and outside observers
  often have been forced to use estimates. From 1990 a UN embargo on Iraq, which made
  travel to and from the country difficult, contributed considerably to the lack of
  information, but most important was the rule of more than 30 years by the Baʿthist
  regime, which was intent on controlling the flow of information about the country.
  The former Iraqi government sought to downplay unflattering demographic shifts in
  its Kurdish and Shīʿite communities while highlighting the effects of the UN embargo
  on health, nutrition, and overall mortality—particularly among the country’s children.UN
  studies indicate that general levels of health and nutrition declined markedly after
  the introduction of the embargo in 1990 and before Iraq accepted the provisions
  of a UN program in late 1996 that allowed Iraq to sell a set quantity of oil in
  order to purchase food, medicine, and other human necessities. This situation led
  to substantial declines in the rates of birth, natural increase, and fertility and
  a noticeable increase in the death rate. Overall vital statistics in Iraq during
  the 1990s, however, remained above world averages and by the 21st century had begun
  to return to their prewar levels.Because of Iraq’s relatively low population density,
  the government has long promoted a policy of population growth, and although it
  is estimated that more than two-fifths of the population is under 15 years of age,
  the total fertility rate has declined since its peak during the late 1960s. This
  decline apparently resulted from the casualties of the two major wars—reaching possibly
  as many as a half million young and early-adult men—and subsequent difficulties
  related to the UN embargo, as well as an overall sense of insecurity among Iraqis.
  For the same reasons, it is reckoned that the rate of natural increase, though still
  high by world standards, had dropped markedly by the mid-1990s before it likewise
  rebounded.The associated hardships of the early to mid-1990s persuaded a number
  of Iraqis—at least those who were wealthy enough and willing to risk the wrath of
  the regime—to either leave the country or seek haven in the northern Kurdish region,
  where, thanks to international aid and a freer market, living conditions improved
  noticeably during the 1990s. Moreover, an estimated one to two million Iraqis—many
  of them unregistered refugees—fled the country to various destinations (including
  Iran, Syria, and Jordan) out of direct fear of government reprisal. During the Iraq
  War, more than 1.6 million Iraqis fled the country and more than 1.2 million were
  displaced internally.Beyond the out-migration of a significant number of Iraqis,
  the major demographic trends in the country since the 1970s have been forced relocation—particularly
  of the Iranian population and, more recently, of the Kurds—forced ethnic homogenization,
  and urbanization. Eastern Iraq has traditionally formed part of a transition zone
  between the Arab and Persian worlds, and, until the Baʿth regime came to power in
  1968, a significant number of ethnic Persians lived in the country (in the same
  way large numbers of ethnic Arabs reside in Iran). Between 1969 and 1980, however,
  they—and many Arabs whom the regime defined as Persian—were deported to Iran.Kurds
  have traditionally populated the northeast, and Sunni Arabs have traditionally predominated
  in central Iraq. During the 1980s the Baʿth regime forcibly moved tens of thousands
  of Kurds from regions along the Iranian border, with many Kurds dying in the process,
  and subsequently relocated large numbers of Arabs to areas traditionally inhabited
  by Kurds, particularly in and around the city of Kirkūk. Kurds in those regions
  have, likewise, been expelled, and many of Iraq’s estimated half million internally
  displaced persons prior to the Iraq War were Kurds. Further, the regime systematically
  compelled large numbers of Kurds and members of smaller ethnic groups to change
  their ethnic identity, forcing them to declare themselves Arabs. Those not acquiescing
  to this pressure faced expulsion, physical abuse, and imprisonment.Iraqis have been
  slowly migrating to urban areas since the 1930s. Population mobility and urban growth
  have, to some extent, created a religious and cultural mix in several large cities,
  particularly in Baghdad. (There has been little change in the overall ethnic patterns
  of the country, however, except through instances of forced migration.) Many Kurds
  have moved either to larger towns in Kurdistan or to larger cities such as Mosul
  or Baghdad. Few Kurds have moved willingly to the south, where Arab Shīʿites have
  traditionally predominated. The latter have moved in substantial numbers to larger
  towns in the south or, particularly during the fighting in the 1980s, to largely
  Shīʿite neighbourhoods in Baghdad. Sunnis migrating from rural areas have moved
  mostly to areas of Baghdad with majorities of their ethnic and religious affinities.From
  the mid-1970s until 1990, labour shortages drew large numbers of foreign workers,
  particularly Egyptians, to Iraq; at its height the number of Egyptians may have
  exceeded two million. Virtually all foreign workers left the country prior to the
  Persian Gulf War, and few, if any, have returned.\r\n"

  Iraq were known as Mesopotamia (“Land Between the Rivers”), a region whose extensive
  alluvial plains gave rise to some of the world’s earliest civilizations, including
  those of Sumer, Akkad, Babylon, and Assyria. This wealthy region, constituting much
  of what is called the Fertile Crescent, later became a valuable part of larger imperial
  polities, including sundry Persian, Greek, and Roman dynasties, and after the 7th
  century became a central and integral part of the Islamic world. Iraq’s capital,
  Baghdad, became the capital of the ʿAbbāsid Caliphate in the 8th century. The modern
  nation-state of Iraq was created following World War I (1914–18) from the Ottoman
  provinces of Baghdad, Al-Baṣrah, and Mosul and derives its name from the Arabic
  term used in the premodern period to describe a region that roughly corresponded
  to Mesopotamia (ʿIrāq ʿArabī, “Arabian Iraq”) and modern northwestern Iran (ʿIrāq
  ʿajamī, “foreign [i.e., Persian] Iraq”).Iraq gained formal independence in 1932
  but remained subject to British imperial influence during the next quarter century
  of turbulent monarchical rule. Political instability on an even greater scale followed
  the overthrow of the monarchy in 1958, but the installation of an Arab nationalist
  and socialist regime—the Baʿth Party—in a bloodless coup 10 years later brought
  new stability. With proven oil reserves second in the world only to those of Saudi
  Arabia, the regime was able to finance ambitious projects and development plans
  throughout the 1970s and to build one of the largest and best-equipped armed forces
  in the Arab world. The party’s leadership, however, was quickly assumed by Ṣaddām
  Ḥussein, a flamboyant and ruthless autocrat who led the country into disastrous
  military adventures—the Iran-Iraq War (1980–88) and the Persian Gulf War (1990–91).
  These conflicts left the country isolated from the international community and financially
  and socially drained, but through unprecedented coercion directed at major sections
  of the population—particularly the country’s disfranchised Kurdish minority and
  Shīʿite majority—Ṣaddām himself was able to maintain a firm hold on power into the
  21st century. He and his regime were toppled in 2003 during the Iraq War.Iraq is
  one of the easternmost countries of the Arab world, located at about the same latitude
  as the southern United States. It is bordered to the north by Turkey, to the east
  by Iran, to the west by Syria and Jordan, and to the south by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
  Iraq has 12 miles (19 km) of coastline along the northern end of the Persian Gulf,
  giving it a tiny sliver of territorial sea. Followed by Jordan, it is thus the Middle
  Eastern state with the least access to the sea and offshore sovereignty.Middle East:
  IraqEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Iraq’s topography can be divided into four physiographic
  regions: the alluvial plains of the central and southeastern parts of the country;
  Al-Jazīrah (Arabic: “the Island”), an upland region in the north between the Tigris
  and Euphrates rivers; deserts in the west and south; and the highlands in the northeast.
  Each of these regions extends into neighbouring countries, although the alluvial
  plains lie largely within Iraq.ʿArab, Shaṭṭ Al-Diane Rawson/Photo ResearchersThe
  plains of lower Mesopotamia extend southward some 375 miles (600 km) from Balad
  on the Tigris and Al-Ramādī on the Euphrates to the Persian Gulf. They cover more
  than 51,000 square miles (132,000 square km), almost one-third of the country’s
  area, and are characterized by low elevation, below 300 feet (100 metres), and poor
  natural drainage. Large areas are subject to widespread seasonal flooding, and there
  are extensive marshlands, some of which dry up in the summer to become salty wastelands.
  Near Al-Qurnah, where the Tigris and Euphrates converge to form the Shatt al-Arab,
  there are still some inhabited marshes. The alluvial plains contain extensive lakes.
  The swampy Lake Al-Ḥammār (Hawr al-Ḥammār) extends 70 miles (110 km) from Al-Baṣrah
  (Basra) to Sūq al-Shuyūkh; its width varies from 8 to 15 miles (13 to 25 km).Euphrates
  River: Euphrates River, north-central Iraq© Nik WheelerNorth of the alluvial plains,
  between the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers, is the arid Al-Jazīrah plateau. Its
  most prominent hill range is the Sinjār Mountains, whose highest peak reaches an
  elevation of 4,448 feet (1,356 metres). The main watercourse is the Wadi Al-Tharthār,
  which runs southward for 130 miles (210 km) from the Sinjār Mountains to the Tharthār
  (Salt) Depression. Milḥat Ashqar is the largest of several salt flats (or sabkhahs)
  in the region.Western and southern Iraq is a vast desert region covering some 64,900
  square miles (168,000 square km), almost two-fifths of the country. The western
  desert, an extension of the Syrian Desert, rises to elevations above 1,600 feet
  (490 metres). The southern desert is known as Al-Ḥajarah in the western part and
  as Al-Dibdibah in the east. Al-Ḥajarah has a complex topography of rocky desert,
  wadis, ridges, and depressions. Al-Dibdibah is a more sandy region with a covering
  of scrub vegetation. Elevation in the southern desert averages between 300 and 1,200
  feet (100 to 400 metres). A height of 3,119 feet (951 metres) is reached at Mount
  ʿUnayzah (ʿUnāzah) at the intersection of the borders of Jordan, Iraq, and Saudi
  Arabia. The deep Wadi Al-Bāṭin runs 45 miles (75 km) in a northeast-southwest direction
  through Al-Dibdibah. It has been recognized since 1913 as the boundary between western
  Kuwait and Iraq.The mountains, hills, and plains of northeastern Iraq occupy some
  35,500 square miles (92,000 square km), about one-fifth of the country. Of this
  area only about one-fourth is mountainous; the remainder is a complex transition
  zone between mountain and lowland. The ancient kingdom of Assyria was located in
  this area. North and northeast of the Assyrian plains and foothills is Kurdistan,
  a mountainous region that extends into Turkey and Iran.The relief of northeastern
  Iraq rises from the Tigris toward the Turkish and Iranian borders in a series of
  rolling plateaus, river basins, and hills until the high mountain ridges of Iraqi
  Kurdistan, associated with the Taurus and Zagros mountains, are reached. These mountains
  are aligned northwest to southeast and are separated by river basins where human
  settlement is possible. The mountain summits have an average elevation of about
  8,000 feet (2,400 metres), rising to 10,000–11,000 feet (3,000–3,300 metres) in
  places. There, along the Iran-Iraq border, is the country’s highest point, Ghundah
  Zhur, which reaches 11,834 feet (3,607 metres). The region is heavily dissected
  by numerous tributaries of the Tigris, notably the Great and Little Zab rivers and
  the Diyālā and ʿUẓaym (Adhaim) rivers. These streams weave tortuously south and
  southwest, cutting through ridges in a number of gorges, notably the Rū Kuchūk gorge,
  northeast of Barzān, and the Bēkma gorge, west of Rawāndūz town. The highest mountain
  ridges contain the only forestland in Iraq.Tigris RiverRobert Harding Picture Library/SuperStockIraq
  is drained by the Tigris-Euphrates river system, although less than half of the
  Tigris-Euphrates basin lies in the country. Both rivers rise in the Armenian highlands
  of Turkey, where they are fed by melting winter snow. The Tigris flows 881 miles
  (1,417 km) and the Euphrates 753 miles (1,212 km) through Iraq before they join
  near Al-Qurnah to form the Shatt al-Arab, which flows another 68 miles (109 km)
  into the Persian Gulf. The Tigris, all of whose tributaries are on its left (east)
  bank, runs close to the high Zagros Mountains, from which it receives a number of
  important tributaries, notably the Great Zab, the Little Zab, and the Diyālā. As
  a result, the Tigris can be subject to devastating floods, as evidenced by the many
  old channels left when the river carved out a new course. The period of maximum
  flow of the Tigris is from March to May, when more than two-fifths of the annual
  total discharge may be received. The Euphrates, whose flow is roughly 50 percent
  greater than that of the Tigris, receives no large tributaries in Iraq.Many dams
  are needed on the rivers and their tributaries to control flooding and permit irrigation.
  Iraq has giant irrigation projects at Bēkma, Bādūsh, and Al-Fatḥah. In the late
  1970s and early ’80s, Iraq completed a large-scale project that connected the Tigris
  and Euphrates. A canal emerges from the Tigris near Sāmarrāʾ and continues southwest
  to Lake Al-Tharthār, and another extends from the lake to the Euphrates near Al-Ḥabbāniyyah.
  This connection is crucial because in years of drought—aggravated by more recent
  upstream use of Euphrates water by Turkey and Syria—the river level is extremely
  low. In 1990 Syria and Iraq reached an agreement to share the water on the basis
  of 58 percent to Iraq and 42 percent to Syria of the total that enters Syria. Turkey,
  for its part, unilaterally promised to secure an annual minimum flow at its border
  with Syria. There is no tripartite agreement.Following the Persian Gulf War, the
  Iraqi government dedicated considerable resources to digging two large canals in
  the south of the country, with the apparent goal of improving irrigation and agricultural
  drainage. There is evidence, however, that these channels were also used to drain
  large parts of Iraq’s southern marshlands, from which rebel forces had carried out
  attacks against government forces. The first was reportedly designed to irrigate
  some 580 square miles (1,500 square km) of desert. The vast operation to create
  it produced a canal roughly 70 miles (115 km) long between Dhī Qār and Al-Baṣrah
  governorates. The second, an even grander scheme, was reportedly designed to irrigate
  an area some 10 times larger than the first. This canal, completed in 1992, extends
  from Al-Yūsufiyyah, 25 miles (40 km) south of Baghdad, to Al-Baṣrah, a total of
  some 350 miles (565 km).The two projects eventually drained some nine-tenths of
  Iraq’s southern marshes, once the largest wetlands system in the Middle East. Much
  of the drained area rapidly turned to arid salt flats. Following the start of the
  Iraq War in 2003, some parts of those projects were dismantled, but experts estimated
  that rehabilitation of the marshes would be impossible without extensive efforts
  and the expenditure of great resources.The desert regions have poorly developed
  soils of coarse texture containing many stones and unweathered rock fragments. Plant
  growth is limited because of aridity, and the humus content is low. In northwestern
  Iraq, soils vary considerably: some regions with steep slopes are badly eroded,
  while the river valleys and basins contain some light fertile soils. In northwest
  Al-Jazīrah, there is an area of potentially fertile soils similar to those found
  in much of the Fertile Crescent. Lowland Iraq is covered by heavy alluvial soils,
  with some organic content and a high proportion of clays, suitable for cultivation
  and for use as a building material.Salinity, caused in part by overirrigation, is
  a serious problem that affects about two-thirds of the land; as a result, large
  areas of agricultural land have had to be abandoned. A high water table and poor
  drainage, coupled with high rates of evaporation, cause alkaline salts to accumulate
  at or near the surface in sufficient quantities to limit agricultural productivity.
  Reversing the effect is a difficult and lengthy process.Heavy soil erosion in parts
  of Iraq, some of it induced by overgrazing and deforestation, leaves soils exposed
  to markedly seasonal rainfall. The Tigris-Euphrates river system has thus created
  a large alluvial deposit at its mouth, so that the Persian Gulf coast is much farther
  south than in Babylonian times.Iraq has two climatic provinces: the hot, arid lowlands,
  including the alluvial plains and the deserts; and the damper northeast, where the
  higher elevation produces cooler temperatures. In the northeast cultivation fed
  by precipitation is possible, but elsewhere irrigation is essential.In the lowlands
  there are two seasons, summer and winter, with short transitional periods between
  them. Summer, which lasts from May to October, is characterized by clear skies,
  extremely high temperatures, and low relative humidity; no precipitation occurs
  from June through September. In Baghdad, July and August mean daily temperatures
  are about 95 °F (35 °C), and summer temperatures of 123 °F (51 °C) have been recorded.
  The diurnal temperatures range in summer is considerable.In winter the paths of
  westerly atmospheric depressions crossing the Middle East shift southward, bringing
  rain to southern Iraq. Annual totals vary considerably from year to year, but mean
  annual precipitation in the lowlands ranges from about 4 to 7 inches (100 to 180
  mm); nearly all of this occurs between November and April.Winter in the lowlands
  lasts from December to February. Temperatures are generally mild, although extremes
  of hot and cold, including frosts, can occur. Winter temperatures in Baghdad range
  from about 35 to 60 °F (2 to 15 °C).In the northeast the summer is shorter than
  in the lowlands, lasting from June to September, and the winter considerably longer.
  The summer is generally dry and hot, but average temperatures are some 5–10 °F (3–6
  °C) cooler than those of lowland Iraq. Winters can be cold because of the region’s
  high relief and the influence of northeasterly winds that bring continental air
  from Central Asia. In Mosul (Al-Mawṣil), January temperatures range between 24 and
  63 °F (−4 and 17 °C); readings as low as 12 °F (−11 °C) have been recorded.In the
  foothills of the northeast, annual precipitation of 12 to 22 inches (300 to 560
  mm), enough to sustain good seasonal pasture, is typical. Precipitation may exceed
  40 inches (1,000 mm) in the mountains, much of which falls as snow. As in the lowlands,
  little rain falls during the summer.A steady northerly and northwesterly summer
  wind, the shamāl, affects all of Iraq. It brings extremely dry air, so hardly any
  clouds form, and the land surface is thus heated intensively by the sun. Another
  wind, the sharqī (Arabic: “easterly”), blows from the south and southeast during
  early summer and early winter; it is often accompanied by dust storms. Dust storms
  occur throughout Iraq during most of the year and may rise to great height in the
  atmosphere. They are particularly frequent in summer, with five or six striking
  central Iraq in July, the peak of the season.Vegetation in Iraq reflects the dominant
  influence of drought. Some Mediterranean and alpine plant species thrive in the
  mountains of Kurdistan, but the open oak forests that formerly were found there
  have largely disappeared. Hawthorns, junipers, terebinths, and wild pears grow on
  the lower mountain slopes. A steppe region of open, treeless vegetation is located
  in the area extending north and northeast from the Ḥamrīn Mountains up to the foothills
  and lower slopes of the mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan. A great variety of herbs and
  shrubs grow in that region. Most belong to the sage and daisy families: mugwort
  (Artemisis vulgaris), goosefoot, milkweed, thyme, and various rhizomic plants are
  examples. There also are many different grasses. Toward the riverine lowlands many
  other plants appear, including storksbill and plantain. Willows, tamarisks, poplars,
  licorice plants, and bulrushes grow along the banks of the lower Tigris and Euphrates
  rivers. The juice of the licorice plant is extracted for commercial purposes. Dozens
  of varieties of date palm flourish throughout southern Iraq, where the date palm
  dominates the landscape. The lakesides and marshlands support many varieties of
  reeds, sedges, pimpernels, vetches, and geraniums. By contrast, vegetation in the
  desert regions is sparse, with tamarisk, milfoil, and various plants of the genera
  Ziziphus and Salsola being characteristic.Euphrates River: marshland© Nik WheelerBirds
  are easily the most conspicuous form of wildlife. There are many resident species,
  though the effect of large-scale drainage of the southern wetlands on migrants and
  seasonal visitors—which were once numerous—has not been fully determined. The lion,
  oryx, ostrich, and wild ass have become extinct in Iraq. Wolves, foxes, jackals,
  hyenas, wild pigs, and wildcats are found, as well as many small animals such as
  martens, badgers, otters, porcupines, and muskrats. The Arabian sand gazelle survives
  in certain remote desert locations. Rivers, streams, and lakes are well stocked
  with a variety of fish, notably carp, various species of Barbus, catfish, and loach.
  In common with other regions of the Middle East, Iraq is a breeding ground for the
  unwelcome desert locust.Modern Iraq, created by combining three separate Ottoman
  provinces in the aftermath of World War I, is one of the most religiously and ethnically
  diverse societies in the Middle East. Although Iraq’s communities generally coexisted
  peacefully, fault lines between communities deepened in the 20th century as a succession
  of authoritarian regimes ruled by exploiting tribal, sectarian, and ethnic divisions.The
  ancient Semitic peoples of Iraq, the Babylonians and Assyrians, and the non-Semitic
  Sumerians were long ago assimilated by successive waves of immigrants. The Arab
  conquests of the 7th century brought about the Arabization of central and southern
  Iraq. A mixed population of Kurds and Arabs inhabit a transition zone between those
  areas and Iraqi Kurdistan in the northeast. Roughly two-thirds of Iraq’s people
  are Arabs, about one-fourth are Kurds, and the remainder consists of small minority
  groups.Iraq’s Arab population is divided between Sunni Muslims and the more numerous
  Shīʿites. These groups, however, are for the most part ethnically and linguistically
  homogenous, and—as is common throughout the region—both value family relations strongly.
  Many Arabs, in fact, identify more strongly with their family or tribe (an extended,
  patrilineal group) than with national or confessional affiliations, a significant
  factor contributing to ongoing difficulties in maintaining a strong central government.
  This challenge is amplified by the numerical size of many extended kin groups—tribal
  units may number thousands or tens of thousands of members—and the consequent political
  and economic clout they wield. Tribal affiliation among Arab groups has continued
  to play an important role in Iraqi politics, and even in areas where tribalism has
  eroded with time (such as major urban centres), family bonds have remained close.
  Several generations may live in a single household (although this is more common
  among rural families), and family-owned-and-operated businesses are the standard.
  Such households tend to be patriarchal, with the eldest male leading the family.Kurdish
  settlementEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Although estimates of their precise numbers
  vary, the Kurds are reckoned to be the fourth largest ethnic group in the Middle
  East, following Arabs, Turks, and Persians. There are important Kurdish minorities
  in Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria, and Iraq’s Kurds are concentrated in the relatively
  inaccessible mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan, which is roughly contiguous with Kurdish
  regions in those other countries. Kurds constitute a separate and distinctive cultural
  group. They are mostly Sunni Muslims who speak one of two dialects of the Kurdish
  language, an Indo-European language closely related to Modern Persian. They have
  a strong tribal structure and distinctive costume, music, and dance.The Kurdish
  people were thwarted in their ambitions for statehood after World War I, and the
  Iraqi Kurds have since resisted inclusion in the state of Iraq. At various times
  the Kurds have been in undisputed control of large tracts of territory. Attempts
  to reach a compromise with the Kurds in their demands for autonomy, however, have
  ended in failure, owing partly to government pressure and partly to the inability
  of Kurdish factional groups to maintain a united front against successive Iraqi
  governments. From 1961 to 1975, aided by military support from Iran, they were intermittently
  in open rebellion against the Iraqi government, as they were during the Iran-Iraq
  War in the 1980s and again, supported largely by the United States, throughout the
  1990s.After its rise to power, the Baʿth regime of Ṣaddām Ḥussein consistently tried
  to extend its control into Kurdish areas through threats, coercion, violence, and,
  at times, the forced internal transfer of large numbers of Kurds. Intermittent Kurdish
  rebellions in the last quarter of the 20th century killed tens of thousands of Kurds—both
  combatants and noncombatants—at the hands of government forces and on various occasions
  forced hundreds of thousands of Kurds to flee to neighbouring Iran and Turkey. Government
  attacks were violent and ruthless and included the use of chemical weapons against
  Kurdish civilians; such incidents took place at the village of Ḥalabjah and elsewhere
  in 1988.Following a failed Kurdish uprising in the wake of the Persian Gulf War,
  the United States and other members of the coalition that it led against Iraq established
  a “safe haven” for the Kurds in an area north of latitude 36° N that was under the
  protection of the international community. Thereafter the Kurds were largely autonomous.
  Kurdish autonomy is upheld in the 2005 constitution, which designates Kurdistan
  as an autonomous federal region.Small communities of Turks, Turkmen, and Assyrians
  survive in northern Iraq. The Lur, a group speaking an Iranian language, live near
  the Iranian border. In addition, a small number of Armenians are found predominantly
  in Baghdad and in pockets throughout the north.More than three-fourths of the people
  speak Arabic, the official language, which has several major dialects; these are
  generally mutually intelligible, but significant variations do exist within the
  country, which makes spoken parlance between some groups (and with Arabic-speaking
  groups in adjacent countries) difficult. Modern Standard Arabic—the benchmark of
  literacy—is taught in schools, and most Arabs and many non-Arabs, even those who
  lack schooling, are able to understand it. Roughly one-fifth of the population speaks
  Kurdish, in one of its two main dialects. Kurdish is the official language in the
  Kurdish Autonomous Region in the north. A number of other languages are spoken by
  smaller ethnic groups, including Turkish, Turkmen, Azerbaijanian, and Syriac. Persian,
  once commonly spoken, is now seldom heard. Bilingualism is fairly common, particularly
  among minorities who are conversant in Arabic. English is widely used in commerce.Iraq
  is predominantly a Muslim country, in which the two major sects of Islam are represented
  more equally than in any other state. Slightly more than half (and according to
  some sources as many as three-fifths) of the population are Shīʿite, and about two-fifths
  are Sunni. Largely for political reasons, the government has not maintained careful
  statistics on the relative proportion of the Sunni and Shīʿite populations. Shīʿites
  are almost exclusively Arab (with some Turkmen and Kurds), while Sunnis are divided
  mainly between Arabs and Kurds but include other, smaller groups, such as Azerbaijanis
  and Turkmen.From the inception of the Iraqi state in 1920 until the fall of the
  government of Ṣaddām Ḥussein in 2003, the ruling elites consisted mainly—although
  not exclusively—of minority Sunni Arabs. Most Sunni Arabs follow the Ḥanafī school
  of jurisprudence and most Kurds the Shāfiʿī school, although this distinction has
  lost the meaning that it had in earlier times.Iraq’s Shīʿites, like their coreligionists
  in Iran, follow the Ithnā ʿAsharī, or Twelver, rite, and, despite the preeminence
  of Iran as a Shīʿite Islamic republic, Iraq has traditionally been the physical
  and spiritual centre of Shīʿism in the Islamic world. Shīʿism’s two most important
  holy cities, Al-Najaf and Karbalāʾ, are located in southern Iraq, as is Al-Kūfah,
  sanctified as the site of the assassination of ʿAlī, the fourth caliph, in the 7th
  century. Sāmarrāʾ, farther north, near Baghdad, is also of great cultural and religious
  significance to Shīʿites as the site of the life and disappearance of the 12th,
  and eponymous, imam, Muḥammad al-Mahdī al-Ḥujjah. In premodern times southern and
  eastern Iraq formed a cultural and religious meeting place between the Arab and
  Persian Shīʿite worlds, and religious scholars moved freely between the two regions.
  Even until relatively recent times, large numbers of notable Iranian scholars could
  be found studying or teaching in the great madrasahs (religious schools) in Al-Najaf
  and Karbalāʾ; the Iranian cleric Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, for instance, spent
  many years lecturing at Al-Najaf while in exile. Although Shīʿites constituted the
  majority of the population, Iraq’s Sunnī rulers gave preferential treatment to influential
  Sunnī tribal networks, and Sunnīs dominated the military officer corps and civil
  service. Shīʿites remained politically and economically marginalized until the fall
  of Ṣaddām Ḥussein’s regime. Since the transition to elective government, Shīʿite
  factions have wielded significant political power.Followers of other religions include
  Christians and even smaller groups of Yazīdīs, Mandaeans, Jews, and Bahāʾīs. (See
  Mandaeanism; Bahāʾī faith.) The nearly extinct Jewish community traces its origins
  to the Babylonian Exile (586–516 bc). Jews formerly constituted a small but significant
  minority and were largely concentrated in or around Baghdad, but, with the rise
  of Zionism, anti-Jewish feelings became widespread. This tension eventually led
  to the massive Farhūd pogrom of June 1941. With the establishment of Israel in 1948,
  most Jews emigrated there or elsewhere. The Christian communities are chiefly descendants
  of the ancient population that was not converted to Islam in the 7th century. They
  are subdivided among various sects, including Nestorians (Assyrians), Chaldeans—who
  broke with the Nestorians in the 16th century and are now affiliated with the Roman
  Catholic Church—and members of the Syriac Orthodox  and Eastern Orthodox churches.
  About one million Christians lived in Iraq when the Iraq War began. International
  organizations estimate that more than half have left the country since then, mostly
  to escape poverty and violence by Muslim extremists.Iraq has a relatively low population
  density overall, but, in the fertile lowlands and the cities, densities are nearly
  four times the national average.The distribution of towns and villages in Iraq follows
  basic patterns established thousands of years ago. Although the proportion of urban
  dwellers has risen over time, about one-third of Iraqis still live in rural areas.
  Today several thousand villages and hamlets are scattered unevenly throughout the
  two-thirds of Iraq that is permanently settled. The greatest concentration of villages
  is in the valleys and lowlands around the Tigris and Euphrates. Most have between
  100 and 2,000 houses, traditionally clustered tightly for defensive purposes. Their
  populations are engaged almost exclusively in agriculture, although essential services
  are located in the larger villages.Villages in the foothills and mountains of the
  largely Kurdish northeast tend to be smaller and more isolated than those of lowland
  Iraq, which befits a lifestyle that is based on animal husbandry and only rarely
  on agriculture. The arid and semiarid areas in the west and south have sparse populations.
  The arid regions, along with the extensive Al-Jazīrah region northwest of Baghdad,
  were traditionally inhabited by nomadic Bedouin tribes, but few of these people
  remain in Iraq. Another lifestyle under threat is that of the Shīʿite marsh dwellers
  (Madan) of southern Iraq. They traditionally have lived in reed dwellings built
  on brushwood foundations or sandspits, but the damage done to the marshes in the
  1990s has largely undermined their way of living. Rice, fish, and edible rushes
  have been staples, supplemented by products of the water buffalo.citadelDiane Rawson/Photo
  ResearchersMore than two-thirds of Iraq’s population are urban dwellers, and almost
  two-fifths of those are concentrated in the five largest cities: Baghdad, Al-Baṣrah,
  Mosul, Arbīl, and Al-Sulaymāniyyah. There are also a considerable number of small
  towns, many of which are market centres, provincial capitals, or the headquarters
  of smaller local government districts. Attempts to stimulate the growth of selected
  small towns have had only modest success, and government efforts to stem the tide
  of people departing rural areas, through agricultural reform and other measures,
  have largely failed.Karkh, Al-Steve McCurry/Magnum PhotosFor a variety of reasons,
  rural migrants have been particularly drawn to Baghdad, the country’s political,
  economic, and communications hub. First, to minimize the danger of riots in the
  capital city, the Baʿth regime—in addition to a variety of security measures—made
  special efforts to maintain a minimal level of public services, even in the poorest
  neighbourhoods. This was especially important after the UN imposed an extended embargo
  on Iraqi trade in response to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, making food rationing
  more necessary than ever before. Distributing rations was more efficient in the
  capital area. Second, chances for employment typically have been better in Baghdad
  than in other cities. This was true as early as the 1930s, when migrants began to
  move to the city. Since that time, Shīʿite Arabs from the south have been the largest
  migrant group in the city, a trend that was enhanced during the Iran-Iraq War as
  many refugees fled the southern war zones. Efforts to limit this influx, and even
  to reverse it, met with only limited success, and, by the beginning of the 21st
  century, Shīʿite Arabs represented a majority in the capital. The poor Shīʿite-Arab
  Al-Thawrah (“Revolution”) quarter—known informally since 2003 as Ṣadr City after
  Muḥammad Ṣādiq al-Ṣadr, a murdered Shīʿite cleric—alone houses more than a million
  people. Prior to the Iraq War, many Baghdad neighbourhoods contained a mix of Sunnī
  and Shiʿīte residents. These neighbourhoods became homogeneous as residents moved
  to safer areas amid the sectarian bloodshed that peaked around 2006. It is estimated
  that one-fifth of the country’s people live in the governorate of Baghdad, almost
  all of them in the city itself.It is no coincidence that Baghdad’s celebrated predecessors,
  Babylon and the Sāsānian capital, Ctesiphon, were located in the same general region.
  Baghdad, itself a city of legend, is located at the heart of what has long been
  a rich agricultural region, and the modern city is the undisputed commercial, manufacturing,
  and service capital of Iraq. Its growth, however, has necessitated costly projects,
  including elaborate flood-prevention schemes completed largely in the 1950s, the
  rehousing of hundreds of thousands of inhabitants of squalid shantytowns (ṣarīfahs)
  in the 1960s (and, on a much smaller scale, in 1979–80), and the construction of
  major domestic water and sewerage projects. The city was damaged during both the
  Persian Gulf War and the Iraq War and required major reconstruction of all parts
  of the infrastructure.Al-Baṣrah, on the west bank of the Shatt al-Arab and formerly
  Iraq’s main port, is the centre of its southern petroleum sector and the hub of
  the country’s date cultivation. One of the great cities of Islamic history and heritage,
  it was badly damaged and largely depopulated during the Iran-Iraq War and, though
  partially reconstructed following that conflict, again suffered during the Persian
  Gulf War and subsequent fighting between Shīʿite rebels and government forces. Much
  of the city’s infrastructure (sewerage and potable water and health care facilities)
  remained in a state of disarray, with dire results for public health. Al-Baṣrah’s
  function as a port has been taken over by Umm Qaṣr, a small deepwater port on the
  gulf.Iraq’s third city, though now its second largest in terms of population, is
  Mosul, which is situated on the Tigris near the ruins of the ancient Assyrian capital
  of Nineveh. Mosul is the centre for the upper Tigris basin, specializing in processing
  and marketing agricultural and animal products. It has grown rapidly, partly as
  a result of the influx of Kurdish refugees fleeing government repression in Iraqi
  Kurdistan. By the end of the 1990s, Mosul too had suffered from government neglect,
  and, relative to Baghdad, its infrastructure and health care facilities were in
  poor condition.Iraq has the fourth largest population in the Middle East, after
  Iran, Egypt, and Turkey. Yet demographic information since 1980 has been difficult
  to obtain and interpret, and outside observers often have been forced to use estimates.
  From 1990 a UN embargo on Iraq, which made travel to and from the country difficult,
  contributed considerably to the lack of information, but most important was the
  rule of more than 30 years by the Baʿthist regime, which was intent on controlling
  the flow of information about the country. The former Iraqi government sought to
  downplay unflattering demographic shifts in its Kurdish and Shīʿite communities
  while highlighting the effects of the UN embargo on health, nutrition, and overall
  mortality—particularly among the country’s children.UN studies indicate that general
  levels of health and nutrition declined markedly after the introduction of the embargo
  in 1990 and before Iraq accepted the provisions of a UN program in late 1996 that
  allowed Iraq to sell a set quantity of oil in order to purchase food, medicine,
  and other human necessities. This situation led to substantial declines in the rates
  of birth, natural increase, and fertility and a noticeable increase in the death
  rate. Overall vital statistics in Iraq during the 1990s, however, remained above
  world averages and by the 21st century had begun to return to their prewar levels.Because
  of Iraq’s relatively low population density, the government has long promoted a
  policy of population growth, and although it is estimated that more than two-fifths
  of the population is under 15 years of age, the total fertility rate has declined
  since its peak during the late 1960s. This decline apparently resulted from the
  casualties of the two major wars—reaching possibly as many as a half million young
  and early-adult men—and subsequent difficulties related to the UN embargo, as well
  as an overall sense of insecurity among Iraqis. For the same reasons, it is reckoned
  that the rate of natural increase, though still high by world standards, had dropped
  markedly by the mid-1990s before it likewise rebounded.The associated hardships
  of the early to mid-1990s persuaded a number of Iraqis—at least those who were wealthy
  enough and willing to risk the wrath of the regime—to either leave the country or
  seek haven in the northern Kurdish region, where, thanks to international aid and
  a freer market, living conditions improved noticeably during the 1990s. Moreover,
  an estimated one to two million Iraqis—many of them unregistered refugees—fled the
  country to various destinations (including Iran, Syria, and Jordan) out of direct
  fear of government reprisal. During the Iraq War, more than 1.6 million Iraqis fled
  the country and more than 1.2 million were displaced internally.Beyond the out-migration
  of a significant number of Iraqis, the major demographic trends in the country since
  the 1970s have been forced relocation—particularly of the Iranian population and,
  more recently, of the Kurds—forced ethnic homogenization, and urbanization. Eastern
  Iraq has traditionally formed part of a transition zone between the Arab and Persian
  worlds, and, until the Baʿth regime came to power in 1968, a significant number
  of ethnic Persians lived in the country (in the same way large numbers of ethnic
  Arabs reside in Iran). Between 1969 and 1980, however, they—and many Arabs whom
  the regime defined as Persian—were deported to Iran.Kurds have traditionally populated
  the northeast, and Sunni Arabs have traditionally predominated in central Iraq.
  During the 1980s the Baʿth regime forcibly moved tens of thousands of Kurds from
  regions along the Iranian border, with many Kurds dying in the process, and subsequently
  relocated large numbers of Arabs to areas traditionally inhabited by Kurds, particularly
  in and around the city of Kirkūk. Kurds in those regions have, likewise, been expelled,
  and many of Iraq’s estimated half million internally displaced persons prior to
  the Iraq War were Kurds. Further, the regime systematically compelled large numbers
  of Kurds and members of smaller ethnic groups to change their ethnic identity, forcing
  them to declare themselves Arabs. Those not acquiescing to this pressure faced expulsion,
  physical abuse, and imprisonment.Iraqis have been slowly migrating to urban areas
  since the 1930s. Population mobility and urban growth have, to some extent, created
  a religious and cultural mix in several large cities, particularly in Baghdad. (There
  has been little change in the overall ethnic patterns of the country, however, except
  through instances of forced migration.) Many Kurds have moved either to larger towns
  in Kurdistan or to larger cities such as Mosul or Baghdad. Few Kurds have moved
  willingly to the south, where Arab Shīʿites have traditionally predominated. The
  latter have moved in substantial numbers to larger towns in the south or, particularly
  during the fighting in the 1980s, to largely Shīʿite neighbourhoods in Baghdad.
  Sunnis migrating from rural areas have moved mostly to areas of Baghdad with majorities
  of their ethnic and religious affinities.From the mid-1970s until 1990, labour shortages
  drew large numbers of foreign workers, particularly Egyptians, to Iraq; at its height
  the number of Egyptians may have exceeded two million. Virtually all foreign workers
  left the country prior to the Persian Gulf War, and few, if any, have returned.1Includes
  8 seats reserved for minorities.2Includes some 2 million refugees in neighbouring

  \               Iraq, country of southwestern Asia.During ancient times the lands
  now comprising Iraq were known as Mesopotamia (“Land Between the Rivers”), a region
  whose extensive alluvial plains gave rise to some of the world’s earliest civilizations,
  including those of Sumer, Akkad, Babylon, and Assyria. This wealthy region, constituting
  much of what is called the Fertile Crescent, later became a valuable part of larger
  imperial polities, including sundry Persian, Greek, and Roman dynasties, and after
  the 7th century became a central and integral part of the Islamic world. Iraq’s
  capital, Baghdad, became the capital of the ʿAbbāsid Caliphate in the 8th century.
  The modern nation-state of Iraq was created following World War I (1914–18) from
  the Ottoman provinces of Baghdad, Al-Baṣrah, and Mosul and derives its name from
  the Arabic term used in the premodern period to describe a region that roughly corresponded
  to Mesopotamia (ʿIrāq ʿArabī, “Arabian Iraq”) and modern northwestern Iran (ʿIrāq
  ʿajamī, “foreign [i.e., Persian] Iraq”).Iraq gained formal independence in 1932
  but remained subject to British imperial influence during the next quarter century
  of turbulent monarchical rule. Political instability on an even greater scale followed
  the overthrow of the monarchy in 1958, but the installation of an Arab nationalist
  and socialist regime—the Baʿth Party—in a bloodless coup 10 years later brought
  new stability. With proven oil reserves second in the world only to those of Saudi
  Arabia, the regime was able to finance ambitious projects and development plans
  throughout the 1970s and to build one of the largest and best-equipped armed forces
  in the Arab world. The party’s leadership, however, was quickly assumed by Ṣaddām
  Ḥussein, a flamboyant and ruthless autocrat who led the country into disastrous
  military adventures—the Iran-Iraq War (1980–88) and the Persian Gulf War (1990–91).
  These conflicts left the country isolated from the international community and financially
  and socially drained, but through unprecedented coercion directed at major sections
  of the population—particularly the country’s disfranchised Kurdish minority and
  Shīʿite majority—Ṣaddām himself was able to maintain a firm hold on power into the
  21st century. He and his regime were toppled in 2003 during the Iraq War.LandIraq
  is one of the easternmost countries of the Arab world, located at about the same
  latitude as the southern United States. It is bordered to the north by Turkey, to
  the east by Iran, to the west by Syria and Jordan, and to the south by Saudi Arabia
  and Kuwait. Iraq has 12 miles (19 km) of coastline along the northern end of the
  Persian Gulf, giving it a tiny sliver of territorial sea. Followed by Jordan, it
  is thus the Middle Eastern state with the least access to the sea and offshore sovereignty.ReliefMiddle
  East: IraqEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Iraq’s topography can be divided into four
  physiographic regions: the alluvial plains of the central and southeastern parts
  of the country; Al-Jazīrah (Arabic: “the Island”), an upland region in the north
  between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers; deserts in the west and south; and the
  highlands in the northeast. Each of these regions extends into neighbouring countries,
  although the alluvial plains lie largely within Iraq.Alluvial plainsʿArab, Shaṭṭ
  Al-Diane Rawson/Photo ResearchersThe plains of lower Mesopotamia extend southward
  some 375 miles (600 km) from Balad on the Tigris and Al-Ramādī on the Euphrates
  to the Persian Gulf. They cover more than 51,000 square miles (132,000 square km),
  almost one-third of the country’s area, and are characterized by low elevation,
  below 300 feet (100 metres), and poor natural drainage. Large areas are subject
  to widespread seasonal flooding, and there are extensive marshlands, some of which
  dry up in the summer to become salty wastelands. Near Al-Qurnah, where the Tigris
  and Euphrates converge to form the Shatt al-Arab, there are still some inhabited
  marshes. The alluvial plains contain extensive lakes. The swampy Lake Al-Ḥammār
  (Hawr al-Ḥammār) extends 70 miles (110 km) from Al-Baṣrah (Basra) to Sūq al-Shuyūkh;
  its width varies from 8 to 15 miles (13 to 25 km).Al-JazīrahEuphrates River: Euphrates
  River, north-central Iraq© Nik WheelerNorth of the alluvial plains, between the
  Tigris and the Euphrates rivers, is the arid Al-Jazīrah plateau. Its most prominent
  hill range is the Sinjār Mountains, whose highest peak reaches an elevation of 4,448
  feet (1,356 metres). The main watercourse is the Wadi Al-Tharthār, which runs southward
  for 130 miles (210 km) from the Sinjār Mountains to the Tharthār (Salt) Depression.
  Milḥat Ashqar is the largest of several salt flats (or sabkhahs) in the region.DesertsWestern
  and southern Iraq is a vast desert region covering some 64,900 square miles (168,000
  square km), almost two-fifths of the country. The western desert, an extension of
  the Syrian Desert, rises to elevations above 1,600 feet (490 metres). The southern
  desert is known as Al-Ḥajarah in the western part and as Al-Dibdibah in the east.
  Al-Ḥajarah has a complex topography of rocky desert, wadis, ridges, and depressions.
  Al-Dibdibah is a more sandy region with a covering of scrub vegetation. Elevation
  in the southern desert averages between 300 and 1,200 feet (100 to 400 metres).
  A height of 3,119 feet (951 metres) is reached at Mount ʿUnayzah (ʿUnāzah) at the
  intersection of the borders of Jordan, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. The deep Wadi Al-Bāṭin
  runs 45 miles (75 km) in a northeast-southwest direction through Al-Dibdibah. It
  has been recognized since 1913 as the boundary between western Kuwait and Iraq.The
  northeastThe mountains, hills, and plains of northeastern Iraq occupy some 35,500
  square miles (92,000 square km), about one-fifth of the country. Of this area only
  about one-fourth is mountainous; the remainder is a complex transition zone between
  mountain and lowland. The ancient kingdom of Assyria was located in this area. North
  and northeast of the Assyrian plains and foothills is Kurdistan, a mountainous region
  that extends into Turkey and Iran.The relief of northeastern Iraq rises from the
  Tigris toward the Turkish and Iranian borders in a series of rolling plateaus, river
  basins, and hills until the high mountain ridges of Iraqi Kurdistan, associated
  with the Taurus and Zagros mountains, are reached. These mountains are aligned northwest
  to southeast and are separated by river basins where human settlement is possible.
  The mountain summits have an average elevation of about 8,000 feet (2,400 metres),
  rising to 10,000–11,000 feet (3,000–3,300 metres) in places. There, along the Iran-Iraq
  border, is the country’s highest point, Ghundah Zhur, which reaches 11,834 feet
  (3,607 metres). The region is heavily dissected by numerous tributaries of the Tigris,
  notably the Great and Little Zab rivers and the Diyālā and ʿUẓaym (Adhaim) rivers.
  These streams weave tortuously south and southwest, cutting through ridges in a
  number of gorges, notably the Rū Kuchūk gorge, northeast of Barzān, and the Bēkma
  gorge, west of Rawāndūz town. The highest mountain ridges contain the only forestland
  in Iraq.DrainageThe Tigris-Euphrates river systemTigris RiverRobert Harding Picture
  Library/SuperStockIraq is drained by the Tigris-Euphrates river system, although
  less than half of the Tigris-Euphrates basin lies in the country. Both rivers rise
  in the Armenian highlands of Turkey, where they are fed by melting winter snow.
  The Tigris flows 881 miles (1,417 km) and the Euphrates 753 miles (1,212 km) through
  Iraq before they join near Al-Qurnah to form the Shatt al-Arab, which flows another
  68 miles (109 km) into the Persian Gulf. The Tigris, all of whose tributaries are
  on its left (east) bank, runs close to the high Zagros Mountains, from which it
  receives a number of important tributaries, notably the Great Zab, the Little Zab,
  and the Diyālā. As a result, the Tigris can be subject to devastating floods, as
  evidenced by the many old channels left when the river carved out a new course.
  The period of maximum flow of the Tigris is from March to May, when more than two-fifths
  of the annual total discharge may be received. The Euphrates, whose flow is roughly
  50 percent greater than that of the Tigris, receives no large tributaries in Iraq.Irrigation
  and canalsMany dams are needed on the rivers and their tributaries to control flooding
  and permit irrigation. Iraq has giant irrigation projects at Bēkma, Bādūsh, and
  Al-Fatḥah. In the late 1970s and early ’80s, Iraq completed a large-scale project
  that connected the Tigris and Euphrates. A canal emerges from the Tigris near Sāmarrāʾ
  and continues southwest to Lake Al-Tharthār, and another extends from the lake to
  the Euphrates near Al-Ḥabbāniyyah. This connection is crucial because in years of
  drought—aggravated by more recent upstream use of Euphrates water by Turkey and
  Syria—the river level is extremely low. In 1990 Syria and Iraq reached an agreement
  to share the water on the basis of 58 percent to Iraq and 42 percent to Syria of
  the total that enters Syria. Turkey, for its part, unilaterally promised to secure
  an annual minimum flow at its border with Syria. There is no tripartite agreement.Following
  the Persian Gulf War, the Iraqi government dedicated considerable resources to digging
  two large canals in the south of the country, with the apparent goal of improving
  irrigation and agricultural drainage. There is evidence, however, that these channels
  were also used to drain large parts of Iraq’s southern marshlands, from which rebel
  forces had carried out attacks against government forces. The first was reportedly
  designed to irrigate some 580 square miles (1,500 square km) of desert. The vast
  operation to create it produced a canal roughly 70 miles (115 km) long between Dhī
  Qār and Al-Baṣrah governorates. The second, an even grander scheme, was reportedly
  designed to irrigate an area some 10 times larger than the first. This canal, completed
  in 1992, extends from Al-Yūsufiyyah, 25 miles (40 km) south of Baghdad, to Al-Baṣrah,
  a total of some 350 miles (565 km).The two projects eventually drained some nine-tenths
  of Iraq’s southern marshes, once the largest wetlands system in the Middle East.
  Much of the drained area rapidly turned to arid salt flats. Following the start
  of the Iraq War in 2003, some parts of those projects were dismantled, but experts
  estimated that rehabilitation of the marshes would be impossible without extensive
  efforts and the expenditure of great resources.SoilsThe desert regions have poorly
  developed soils of coarse texture containing many stones and unweathered rock fragments.
  Plant growth is limited because of aridity, and the humus content is low. In northwestern
  Iraq, soils vary considerably: some regions with steep slopes are badly eroded,
  while the river valleys and basins contain some light fertile soils. In northwest
  Al-Jazīrah, there is an area of potentially fertile soils similar to those found
  in much of the Fertile Crescent. Lowland Iraq is covered by heavy alluvial soils,
  with some organic content and a high proportion of clays, suitable for cultivation
  and for use as a building material.Salinity, caused in part by overirrigation, is
  a serious problem that affects about two-thirds of the land; as a result, large
  areas of agricultural land have had to be abandoned. A high water table and poor
  drainage, coupled with high rates of evaporation, cause alkaline salts to accumulate
  at or near the surface in sufficient quantities to limit agricultural productivity.
  Reversing the effect is a difficult and lengthy process.Heavy soil erosion in parts
  of Iraq, some of it induced by overgrazing and deforestation, leaves soils exposed
  to markedly seasonal rainfall. The Tigris-Euphrates river system has thus created
  a large alluvial deposit at its mouth, so that the Persian Gulf coast is much farther
  south than in Babylonian times.ClimateIraq has two climatic provinces: the hot,
  arid lowlands, including the alluvial plains and the deserts; and the damper northeast,
  where the higher elevation produces cooler temperatures. In the northeast cultivation
  fed by precipitation is possible, but elsewhere irrigation is essential.In the lowlands
  there are two seasons, summer and winter, with short transitional periods between
  them. Summer, which lasts from May to October, is characterized by clear skies,
  extremely high temperatures, and low relative humidity; no precipitation occurs
  from June through September. In Baghdad, July and August mean daily temperatures
  are about 95 °F (35 °C), and summer temperatures of 123 °F (51 °C) have been recorded.
  The diurnal temperatures range in summer is considerable.In winter the paths of
  westerly atmospheric depressions crossing the Middle East shift southward, bringing
  rain to southern Iraq. Annual totals vary considerably from year to year, but mean
  annual precipitation in the lowlands ranges from about 4 to 7 inches (100 to 180
  mm); nearly all of this occurs between November and April.Winter in the lowlands
  lasts from December to February. Temperatures are generally mild, although extremes
  of hot and cold, including frosts, can occur. Winter temperatures in Baghdad range
  from about 35 to 60 °F (2 to 15 °C).In the northeast the summer is shorter than
  in the lowlands, lasting from June to September, and the winter considerably longer.
  The summer is generally dry and hot, but average temperatures are some 5–10 °F (3–6
  °C) cooler than those of lowland Iraq. Winters can be cold because of the region’s
  high relief and the influence of northeasterly winds that bring continental air
  from Central Asia. In Mosul (Al-Mawṣil), January temperatures range between 24 and
  63 °F (−4 and 17 °C); readings as low as 12 °F (−11 °C) have been recorded.In the
  foothills of the northeast, annual precipitation of 12 to 22 inches (300 to 560
  mm), enough to sustain good seasonal pasture, is typical. Precipitation may exceed
  40 inches (1,000 mm) in the mountains, much of which falls as snow. As in the lowlands,
  little rain falls during the summer.A steady northerly and northwesterly summer
  wind, the shamāl, affects all of Iraq. It brings extremely dry air, so hardly any
  clouds form, and the land surface is thus heated intensively by the sun. Another
  wind, the sharqī (Arabic: “easterly”), blows from the south and southeast during
  early summer and early winter; it is often accompanied by dust storms. Dust storms
  occur throughout Iraq during most of the year and may rise to great height in the
  atmosphere. They are particularly frequent in summer, with five or six striking
  central Iraq in July, the peak of the season.Plant and animal lifeVegetation in
  Iraq reflects the dominant influence of drought. Some Mediterranean and alpine plant
  species thrive in the mountains of Kurdistan, but the open oak forests that formerly
  were found there have largely disappeared. Hawthorns, junipers, terebinths, and
  wild pears grow on the lower mountain slopes. A steppe region of open, treeless
  vegetation is located in the area extending north and northeast from the Ḥamrīn
  Mountains up to the foothills and lower slopes of the mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan.
  A great variety of herbs and shrubs grow in that region. Most belong to the sage
  and daisy families: mugwort (Artemisis vulgaris), goosefoot, milkweed, thyme, and
  various rhizomic plants are examples. There also are many different grasses. Toward
  the riverine lowlands many other plants appear, including storksbill and plantain.
  Willows, tamarisks, poplars, licorice plants, and bulrushes grow along the banks
  of the lower Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The juice of the licorice plant is extracted
  for commercial purposes. Dozens of varieties of date palm flourish throughout southern
  Iraq, where the date palm dominates the landscape. The lakesides and marshlands
  support many varieties of reeds, sedges, pimpernels, vetches, and geraniums. By
  contrast, vegetation in the desert regions is sparse, with tamarisk, milfoil, and
  various plants of the genera Ziziphus and Salsola being characteristic.Euphrates
  River: marshland© Nik WheelerBirds are easily the most conspicuous form of wildlife.
  There are many resident species, though the effect of large-scale drainage of the
  southern wetlands on migrants and seasonal visitors—which were once numerous—has
  not been fully determined. The lion, oryx, ostrich, and wild ass have become extinct
  in Iraq. Wolves, foxes, jackals, hyenas, wild pigs, and wildcats are found, as well
  as many small animals such as martens, badgers, otters, porcupines, and muskrats.
  The Arabian sand gazelle survives in certain remote desert locations. Rivers, streams,
  and lakes are well stocked with a variety of fish, notably carp, various species
  of Barbus, catfish, and loach. In common with other regions of the Middle East,
  Iraq is a breeding ground for the unwelcome desert locust.PeopleModern Iraq, created
  by combining three separate Ottoman provinces in the aftermath of World War I, is
  one of the most religiously and ethnically diverse societies in the Middle East.
  Although Iraq’s communities generally coexisted peacefully, fault lines between
  communities deepened in the 20th century as a succession of authoritarian regimes
  ruled by exploiting tribal, sectarian, and ethnic divisions.Ethnic groupsThe ancient
  Semitic peoples of Iraq, the Babylonians and Assyrians, and the non-Semitic Sumerians
  were long ago assimilated by successive waves of immigrants. The Arab conquests
  of the 7th century brought about the Arabization of central and southern Iraq. A
  mixed population of Kurds and Arabs inhabit a transition zone between those areas
  and Iraqi Kurdistan in the northeast. Roughly two-thirds of Iraq’s people are Arabs,
  about one-fourth are Kurds, and the remainder consists of small minority groups.ArabsIraq’s
  Arab population is divided between Sunni Muslims and the more numerous Shīʿites.
  These groups, however, are for the most part ethnically and linguistically homogenous,
  and—as is common throughout the region—both value family relations strongly. Many
  Arabs, in fact, identify more strongly with their family or tribe (an extended,
  patrilineal group) than with national or confessional affiliations, a significant
  factor contributing to ongoing difficulties in maintaining a strong central government.
  This challenge is amplified by the numerical size of many extended kin groups—tribal
  units may number thousands or tens of thousands of members—and the consequent political
  and economic clout they wield. Tribal affiliation among Arab groups has continued
  to play an important role in Iraqi politics, and even in areas where tribalism has
  eroded with time (such as major urban centres), family bonds have remained close.
  Several generations may live in a single household (although this is more common
  among rural families), and family-owned-and-operated businesses are the standard.
  Such households tend to be patriarchal, with the eldest male leading the family.KurdsKurdish
  settlementEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Although estimates of their precise numbers
  vary, the Kurds are reckoned to be the fourth largest ethnic group in the Middle
  East, following Arabs, Turks, and Persians. There are important Kurdish minorities
  in Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria, and Iraq’s Kurds are concentrated in the relatively
  inaccessible mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan, which is roughly contiguous with Kurdish
  regions in those other countries. Kurds constitute a separate and distinctive cultural
  group. They are mostly Sunni Muslims who speak one of two dialects of the Kurdish
  language, an Indo-European language closely related to Modern Persian. They have
  a strong tribal structure and distinctive costume, music, and dance.The Kurdish
  people were thwarted in their ambitions for statehood after World War I, and the
  Iraqi Kurds have since resisted inclusion in the state of Iraq. At various times
  the Kurds have been in undisputed control of large tracts of territory. Attempts
  to reach a compromise with the Kurds in their demands for autonomy, however, have
  ended in failure, owing partly to government pressure and partly to the inability
  of Kurdish factional groups to maintain a united front against successive Iraqi
  governments. From 1961 to 1975, aided by military support from Iran, they were intermittently
  in open rebellion against the Iraqi government, as they were during the Iran-Iraq
  War in the 1980s and again, supported largely by the United States, throughout the
  1990s.After its rise to power, the Baʿth regime of Ṣaddām Ḥussein consistently tried
  to extend its control into Kurdish areas through threats, coercion, violence, and,
  at times, the forced internal transfer of large numbers of Kurds. Intermittent Kurdish
  rebellions in the last quarter of the 20th century killed tens of thousands of Kurds—both
  combatants and noncombatants—at the hands of government forces and on various occasions
  forced hundreds of thousands of Kurds to flee to neighbouring Iran and Turkey. Government
  attacks were violent and ruthless and included the use of chemical weapons against
  Kurdish civilians; such incidents took place at the village of Ḥalabjah and elsewhere
  in 1988.Following a failed Kurdish uprising in the wake of the Persian Gulf War,
  the United States and other members of the coalition that it led against Iraq established
  a “safe haven” for the Kurds in an area north of latitude 36° N that was under the
  protection of the international community. Thereafter the Kurds were largely autonomous.
  Kurdish autonomy is upheld in the 2005 constitution, which designates Kurdistan
  as an autonomous federal region.Other minoritiesSmall communities of Turks, Turkmen,
  and Assyrians survive in northern Iraq. The Lur, a group speaking an Iranian language,
  live near the Iranian border. In addition, a small number of Armenians are found
  predominantly in Baghdad and in pockets throughout the north.LanguagesMore than
  three-fourths of the people speak Arabic, the official language, which has several
  major dialects; these are generally mutually intelligible, but significant variations
  do exist within the country, which makes spoken parlance between some groups (and
  with Arabic-speaking groups in adjacent countries) difficult. Modern Standard Arabic—the
  benchmark of literacy—is taught in schools, and most Arabs and many non-Arabs, even
  those who lack schooling, are able to understand it. Roughly one-fifth of the population
  speaks Kurdish, in one of its two main dialects. Kurdish is the official language
  in the Kurdish Autonomous Region in the north. A number of other languages are spoken
  by smaller ethnic groups, including Turkish, Turkmen, Azerbaijanian, and Syriac.
  Persian, once commonly spoken, is now seldom heard. Bilingualism is fairly common,
  particularly among minorities who are conversant in Arabic. English is widely used
  in commerce.ReligionIraq is predominantly a Muslim country, in which the two major
  sects of Islam are represented more equally than in any other state. Slightly more
  than half (and according to some sources as many as three-fifths) of the population
  are Shīʿite, and about two-fifths are Sunni. Largely for political reasons, the
  government has not maintained careful statistics on the relative proportion of the
  Sunni and Shīʿite populations. Shīʿites are almost exclusively Arab (with some Turkmen
  and Kurds), while Sunnis are divided mainly between Arabs and Kurds but include
  other, smaller groups, such as Azerbaijanis and Turkmen.SunnisFrom the inception
  of the Iraqi state in 1920 until the fall of the government of Ṣaddām Ḥussein in
  2003, the ruling elites consisted mainly—although not exclusively—of minority Sunni
  Arabs. Most Sunni Arabs follow the Ḥanafī school of jurisprudence and most Kurds
  the Shāfiʿī school, although this distinction has lost the meaning that it had in
  earlier times.ShīʿitesIraq’s Shīʿites, like their coreligionists in Iran, follow
  the Ithnā ʿAsharī, or Twelver, rite, and, despite the preeminence of Iran as a Shīʿite
  Islamic republic, Iraq has traditionally been the physical and spiritual centre
  of Shīʿism in the Islamic world. Shīʿism’s two most important holy cities, Al-Najaf
  and Karbalāʾ, are located in southern Iraq, as is Al-Kūfah, sanctified as the site
  of the assassination of ʿAlī, the fourth caliph, in the 7th century. Sāmarrāʾ, farther
  north, near Baghdad, is also of great cultural and religious significance to Shīʿites
  as the site of the life and disappearance of the 12th, and eponymous, imam, Muḥammad
  al-Mahdī al-Ḥujjah. In premodern times southern and eastern Iraq formed a cultural
  and religious meeting place between the Arab and Persian Shīʿite worlds, and religious
  scholars moved freely between the two regions. Even until relatively recent times,
  large numbers of notable Iranian scholars could be found studying or teaching in
  the great madrasahs (religious schools) in Al-Najaf and Karbalāʾ; the Iranian cleric
  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, for instance, spent many years lecturing at Al-Najaf
  while in exile. Although Shīʿites constituted the majority of the population, Iraq’s
  Sunnī rulers gave preferential treatment to influential Sunnī tribal networks, and
  Sunnīs dominated the military officer corps and civil service. Shīʿites remained
  politically and economically marginalized until the fall of Ṣaddām Ḥussein’s regime.
  Since the transition to elective government, Shīʿite factions have wielded significant
  political power.Religious minoritiesFollowers of other religions include Christians
  and even smaller groups of Yazīdīs, Mandaeans, Jews, and Bahāʾīs. (See Mandaeanism;
  Bahāʾī faith.) The nearly extinct Jewish community traces its origins to the Babylonian
  Exile (586–516 bc). Jews formerly constituted a small but significant minority and
  were largely concentrated in or around Baghdad, but, with the rise of Zionism, anti-Jewish
  feelings became widespread. This tension eventually led to the massive Farhūd pogrom
  of June 1941. With the establishment of Israel in 1948, most Jews emigrated there
  or elsewhere. The Christian communities are chiefly descendants of the ancient population
  that was not converted to Islam in the 7th century. They are subdivided among various
  sects, including Nestorians (Assyrians), Chaldeans—who broke with the Nestorians
  in the 16th century and are now affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church—and members
  of the Syriac Orthodox  and Eastern Orthodox churches. About one million Christians
  lived in Iraq when the Iraq War began. International organizations estimate that
  more than half have left the country since then, mostly to escape poverty and violence
  by Muslim extremists.Settlement patternsIraq has a relatively low population density
  overall, but, in the fertile lowlands and the cities, densities are nearly four
  times the national average.Rural settlementThe distribution of towns and villages
  in Iraq follows basic patterns established thousands of years ago. Although the
  proportion of urban dwellers has risen over time, about one-third of Iraqis still
  live in rural areas. Today several thousand villages and hamlets are scattered unevenly
  throughout the two-thirds of Iraq that is permanently settled. The greatest concentration
  of villages is in the valleys and lowlands around the Tigris and Euphrates. Most
  have between 100 and 2,000 houses, traditionally clustered tightly for defensive
  purposes. Their populations are engaged almost exclusively in agriculture, although
  essential services are located in the larger villages.Villages in the foothills
  and mountains of the largely Kurdish northeast tend to be smaller and more isolated
  than those of lowland Iraq, which befits a lifestyle that is based on animal husbandry
  and only rarely on agriculture. The arid and semiarid areas in the west and south
  have sparse populations. The arid regions, along with the extensive Al-Jazīrah region
  northwest of Baghdad, were traditionally inhabited by nomadic Bedouin tribes, but
  few of these people remain in Iraq. Another lifestyle under threat is that of the
  Shīʿite marsh dwellers (Madan) of southern Iraq. They traditionally have lived in
  reed dwellings built on brushwood foundations or sandspits, but the damage done
  to the marshes in the 1990s has largely undermined their way of living. Rice, fish,
  and edible rushes have been staples, supplemented by products of the water buffalo.Urban
  settlementcitadelDiane Rawson/Photo ResearchersMore than two-thirds of Iraq’s population
  are urban dwellers, and almost two-fifths of those are concentrated in the five
  largest cities: Baghdad, Al-Baṣrah, Mosul, Arbīl, and Al-Sulaymāniyyah. There are
  also a considerable number of small towns, many of which are market centres, provincial
  capitals, or the headquarters of smaller local government districts. Attempts to
  stimulate the growth of selected small towns have had only modest success, and government
  efforts to stem the tide of people departing rural areas, through agricultural reform
  and other measures, have largely failed.BaghdadKarkh, Al-Steve McCurry/Magnum PhotosFor
  a variety of reasons, rural migrants have been particularly drawn to Baghdad, the
  country’s political, economic, and communications hub. First, to minimize the danger
  of riots in the capital city, the Baʿth regime—in addition to a variety of security
  measures—made special efforts to maintain a minimal level of public services, even
  in the poorest neighbourhoods. This was especially important after the UN imposed
  an extended embargo on Iraqi trade in response to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990,
  making food rationing more necessary than ever before. Distributing rations was
  more efficient in the capital area. Second, chances for employment typically have
  been better in Baghdad than in other cities. This was true as early as the 1930s,
  when migrants began to move to the city. Since that time, Shīʿite Arabs from the
  south have been the largest migrant group in the city, a trend that was enhanced
  during the Iran-Iraq War as many refugees fled the southern war zones. Efforts to
  limit this influx, and even to reverse it, met with only limited success, and, by
  the beginning of the 21st century, Shīʿite Arabs represented a majority in the capital.
  The poor Shīʿite-Arab Al-Thawrah (“Revolution”) quarter—known informally since 2003
  as Ṣadr City after Muḥammad Ṣādiq al-Ṣadr, a murdered Shīʿite cleric—alone houses
  more than a million people. Prior to the Iraq War, many Baghdad neighbourhoods contained
  a mix of Sunnī and Shiʿīte residents. These neighbourhoods became homogeneous as
  residents moved to safer areas amid the sectarian bloodshed that peaked around 2006.
  It is estimated that one-fifth of the country’s people live in the governorate of
  Baghdad, almost all of them in the city itself.It is no coincidence that Baghdad’s
  celebrated predecessors, Babylon and the Sāsānian capital, Ctesiphon, were located
  in the same general region. Baghdad, itself a city of legend, is located at the
  heart of what has long been a rich agricultural region, and the modern city is the
  undisputed commercial, manufacturing, and service capital of Iraq. Its growth, however,
  has necessitated costly projects, including elaborate flood-prevention schemes completed
  largely in the 1950s, the rehousing of hundreds of thousands of inhabitants of squalid
  shantytowns (ṣarīfahs) in the 1960s (and, on a much smaller scale, in 1979–80),
  and the construction of major domestic water and sewerage projects. The city was
  damaged during both the Persian Gulf War and the Iraq War and required major reconstruction
  of all parts of the infrastructure.Regional centresAl-Baṣrah, on the west bank of
  the Shatt al-Arab and formerly Iraq’s main port, is the centre of its southern petroleum
  sector and the hub of the country’s date cultivation. One of the great cities of
  Islamic history and heritage, it was badly damaged and largely depopulated during
  the Iran-Iraq War and, though partially reconstructed following that conflict, again
  suffered during the Persian Gulf War and subsequent fighting between Shīʿite rebels
  and government forces. Much of the city’s infrastructure (sewerage and potable water
  and health care facilities) remained in a state of disarray, with dire results for
  public health. Al-Baṣrah’s function as a port has been taken over by Umm Qaṣr, a
  small deepwater port on the gulf.Iraq’s third city, though now its second largest
  in terms of population, is Mosul, which is situated on the Tigris near the ruins
  of the ancient Assyrian capital of Nineveh. Mosul is the centre for the upper Tigris
  basin, specializing in processing and marketing agricultural and animal products.
  It has grown rapidly, partly as a result of the influx of Kurdish refugees fleeing
  government repression in Iraqi Kurdistan. By the end of the 1990s, Mosul too had
  suffered from government neglect, and, relative to Baghdad, its infrastructure and
  health care facilities were in poor condition.Demographic trendsIraq has the fourth
  largest population in the Middle East, after Iran, Egypt, and Turkey. Yet demographic
  information since 1980 has been difficult to obtain and interpret, and outside observers
  often have been forced to use estimates. From 1990 a UN embargo on Iraq, which made
  travel to and from the country difficult, contributed considerably to the lack of
  information, but most important was the rule of more than 30 years by the Baʿthist
  regime, which was intent on controlling the flow of information about the country.
  The former Iraqi government sought to downplay unflattering demographic shifts in
  its Kurdish and Shīʿite communities while highlighting the effects of the UN embargo
  on health, nutrition, and overall mortality—particularly among the country’s children.UN
  studies indicate that general levels of health and nutrition declined markedly after
  the introduction of the embargo in 1990 and before Iraq accepted the provisions
  of a UN program in late 1996 that allowed Iraq to sell a set quantity of oil in
  order to purchase food, medicine, and other human necessities. This situation led
  to substantial declines in the rates of birth, natural increase, and fertility and
  a noticeable increase in the death rate. Overall vital statistics in Iraq during
  the 1990s, however, remained above world averages and by the 21st century had begun
  to return to their prewar levels.Because of Iraq’s relatively low population density,
  the government has long promoted a policy of population growth, and although it
  is estimated that more than two-fifths of the population is under 15 years of age,
  the total fertility rate has declined since its peak during the late 1960s. This
  decline apparently resulted from the casualties of the two major wars—reaching possibly
  as many as a half million young and early-adult men—and subsequent difficulties
  related to the UN embargo, as well as an overall sense of insecurity among Iraqis.
  For the same reasons, it is reckoned that the rate of natural increase, though still
  high by world standards, had dropped markedly by the mid-1990s before it likewise
  rebounded.The associated hardships of the early to mid-1990s persuaded a number
  of Iraqis—at least those who were wealthy enough and willing to risk the wrath of
  the regime—to either leave the country or seek haven in the northern Kurdish region,
  where, thanks to international aid and a freer market, living conditions improved
  noticeably during the 1990s. Moreover, an estimated one to two million Iraqis—many
  of them unregistered refugees—fled the country to various destinations (including
  Iran, Syria, and Jordan) out of direct fear of government reprisal. During the Iraq
  War, more than 1.6 million Iraqis fled the country and more than 1.2 million were
  displaced internally.Beyond the out-migration of a significant number of Iraqis,
  the major demographic trends in the country since the 1970s have been forced relocation—particularly
  of the Iranian population and, more recently, of the Kurds—forced ethnic homogenization,
  and urbanization. Eastern Iraq has traditionally formed part of a transition zone
  between the Arab and Persian worlds, and, until the Baʿth regime came to power in
  1968, a significant number of ethnic Persians lived in the country (in the same
  way large numbers of ethnic Arabs reside in Iran). Between 1969 and 1980, however,
  they—and many Arabs whom the regime defined as Persian—were deported to Iran.Kurds
  have traditionally populated the northeast, and Sunni Arabs have traditionally predominated
  in central Iraq. During the 1980s the Baʿth regime forcibly moved tens of thousands
  of Kurds from regions along the Iranian border, with many Kurds dying in the process,
  and subsequently relocated large numbers of Arabs to areas traditionally inhabited
  by Kurds, particularly in and around the city of Kirkūk. Kurds in those regions
  have, likewise, been expelled, and many of Iraq’s estimated half million internally
  displaced persons prior to the Iraq War were Kurds. Further, the regime systematically
  compelled large numbers of Kurds and members of smaller ethnic groups to change
  their ethnic identity, forcing them to declare themselves Arabs. Those not acquiescing
  to this pressure faced expulsion, physical abuse, and imprisonment.Iraqis have been
  slowly migrating to urban areas since the 1930s. Population mobility and urban growth
  have, to some extent, created a religious and cultural mix in several large cities,
  particularly in Baghdad. (There has been little change in the overall ethnic patterns
  of the country, however, except through instances of forced migration.) Many Kurds
  have moved either to larger towns in Kurdistan or to larger cities such as Mosul
  or Baghdad. Few Kurds have moved willingly to the south, where Arab Shīʿites have
  traditionally predominated. The latter have moved in substantial numbers to larger
  towns in the south or, particularly during the fighting in the 1980s, to largely
  Shīʿite neighbourhoods in Baghdad. Sunnis migrating from rural areas have moved
  mostly to areas of Baghdad with majorities of their ethnic and religious affinities.From
  the mid-1970s until 1990, labour shortages drew large numbers of foreign workers,
  particularly Egyptians, to Iraq; at its height the number of Egyptians may have
  exceeded two million. Virtually all foreign workers left the country prior to the
  Persian Gulf War, and few, if any, have returned.\r\n                \n\n        \n

  ancient times the lands now comprising Iraq were known as Mesopotamia (“Land Between
  the Rivers”), a region whose extensive alluvial plains gave rise to some of the
  world’s earliest civilizations, including those of Sumer, Akkad, Babylon, and Assyria.
  This wealthy region, constituting much of what is called the Fertile Crescent, later
  became a valuable part of larger imperial polities, including sundry Persian, Greek,
  and Roman dynasties, and after the 7th century became a central and integral part
  of the Islamic world. Iraq’s capital, Baghdad, became the capital of the ʿAbbāsid
  Caliphate in the 8th century. The modern nation-state of Iraq was created following
  World War I (1914–18) from the Ottoman provinces of Baghdad, Al-Baṣrah, and Mosul
  and derives its name from the Arabic term used in the premodern period to describe
  a region that roughly corresponded to Mesopotamia (ʿIrāq ʿArabī, “Arabian Iraq”)
  and modern northwestern Iran (ʿIrāq ʿajamī, “foreign [i.e., Persian] Iraq”).Iraq
  gained formal independence in 1932 but remained subject to British imperial influence
  during the next quarter century of turbulent monarchical rule. Political instability
  on an even greater scale followed the overthrow of the monarchy in 1958, but the
  installation of an Arab nationalist and socialist regime—the Baʿth Party—in a bloodless
  coup 10 years later brought new stability. With proven oil reserves second in the
  world only to those of Saudi Arabia, the regime was able to finance ambitious projects
  and development plans throughout the 1970s and to build one of the largest and best-equipped
  armed forces in the Arab world. The party’s leadership, however, was quickly assumed
  by Ṣaddām Ḥussein, a flamboyant and ruthless autocrat who led the country into disastrous
  military adventures—the Iran-Iraq War (1980–88) and the Persian Gulf War (1990–91).
  These conflicts left the country isolated from the international community and financially
  and socially drained, but through unprecedented coercion directed at major sections
  of the population—particularly the country’s disfranchised Kurdish minority and
  Shīʿite majority—Ṣaddām himself was able to maintain a firm hold on power into the
  21st century. He and his regime were toppled in 2003 during the Iraq War.Iraq is
  one of the easternmost countries of the Arab world, located at about the same latitude
  as the southern United States. It is bordered to the north by Turkey, to the east
  by Iran, to the west by Syria and Jordan, and to the south by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
  Iraq has 12 miles (19 km) of coastline along the northern end of the Persian Gulf,
  giving it a tiny sliver of territorial sea. Followed by Jordan, it is thus the Middle
  Eastern state with the least access to the sea and offshore sovereignty.Middle East:
  IraqEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Iraq’s topography can be divided into four physiographic
  regions: the alluvial plains of the central and southeastern parts of the country;
  Al-Jazīrah (Arabic: “the Island”), an upland region in the north between the Tigris
  and Euphrates rivers; deserts in the west and south; and the highlands in the northeast.
  Each of these regions extends into neighbouring countries, although the alluvial
  plains lie largely within Iraq.ʿArab, Shaṭṭ Al-Diane Rawson/Photo ResearchersThe
  plains of lower Mesopotamia extend southward some 375 miles (600 km) from Balad
  on the Tigris and Al-Ramādī on the Euphrates to the Persian Gulf. They cover more
  than 51,000 square miles (132,000 square km), almost one-third of the country’s
  area, and are characterized by low elevation, below 300 feet (100 metres), and poor
  natural drainage. Large areas are subject to widespread seasonal flooding, and there
  are extensive marshlands, some of which dry up in the summer to become salty wastelands.
  Near Al-Qurnah, where the Tigris and Euphrates converge to form the Shatt al-Arab,
  there are still some inhabited marshes. The alluvial plains contain extensive lakes.
  The swampy Lake Al-Ḥammār (Hawr al-Ḥammār) extends 70 miles (110 km) from Al-Baṣrah
  (Basra) to Sūq al-Shuyūkh; its width varies from 8 to 15 miles (13 to 25 km).Euphrates
  River: Euphrates River, north-central Iraq© Nik WheelerNorth of the alluvial plains,
  between the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers, is the arid Al-Jazīrah plateau. Its
  most prominent hill range is the Sinjār Mountains, whose highest peak reaches an
  elevation of 4,448 feet (1,356 metres). The main watercourse is the Wadi Al-Tharthār,
  which runs southward for 130 miles (210 km) from the Sinjār Mountains to the Tharthār
  (Salt) Depression. Milḥat Ashqar is the largest of several salt flats (or sabkhahs)
  in the region.Western and southern Iraq is a vast desert region covering some 64,900
  square miles (168,000 square km), almost two-fifths of the country. The western
  desert, an extension of the Syrian Desert, rises to elevations above 1,600 feet
  (490 metres). The southern desert is known as Al-Ḥajarah in the western part and
  as Al-Dibdibah in the east. Al-Ḥajarah has a complex topography of rocky desert,
  wadis, ridges, and depressions. Al-Dibdibah is a more sandy region with a covering
  of scrub vegetation. Elevation in the southern desert averages between 300 and 1,200
  feet (100 to 400 metres). A height of 3,119 feet (951 metres) is reached at Mount
  ʿUnayzah (ʿUnāzah) at the intersection of the borders of Jordan, Iraq, and Saudi
  Arabia. The deep Wadi Al-Bāṭin runs 45 miles (75 km) in a northeast-southwest direction
  through Al-Dibdibah. It has been recognized since 1913 as the boundary between western
  Kuwait and Iraq.The mountains, hills, and plains of northeastern Iraq occupy some
  35,500 square miles (92,000 square km), about one-fifth of the country. Of this
  area only about one-fourth is mountainous; the remainder is a complex transition
  zone between mountain and lowland. The ancient kingdom of Assyria was located in
  this area. North and northeast of the Assyrian plains and foothills is Kurdistan,
  a mountainous region that extends into Turkey and Iran.The relief of northeastern
  Iraq rises from the Tigris toward the Turkish and Iranian borders in a series of
  rolling plateaus, river basins, and hills until the high mountain ridges of Iraqi
  Kurdistan, associated with the Taurus and Zagros mountains, are reached. These mountains
  are aligned northwest to southeast and are separated by river basins where human
  settlement is possible. The mountain summits have an average elevation of about
  8,000 feet (2,400 metres), rising to 10,000–11,000 feet (3,000–3,300 metres) in
  places. There, along the Iran-Iraq border, is the country’s highest point, Ghundah
  Zhur, which reaches 11,834 feet (3,607 metres). The region is heavily dissected
  by numerous tributaries of the Tigris, notably the Great and Little Zab rivers and
  the Diyālā and ʿUẓaym (Adhaim) rivers. These streams weave tortuously south and
  southwest, cutting through ridges in a number of gorges, notably the Rū Kuchūk gorge,
  northeast of Barzān, and the Bēkma gorge, west of Rawāndūz town. The highest mountain
  ridges contain the only forestland in Iraq.Tigris RiverRobert Harding Picture Library/SuperStockIraq
  is drained by the Tigris-Euphrates river system, although less than half of the
  Tigris-Euphrates basin lies in the country. Both rivers rise in the Armenian highlands
  of Turkey, where they are fed by melting winter snow. The Tigris flows 881 miles
  (1,417 km) and the Euphrates 753 miles (1,212 km) through Iraq before they join
  near Al-Qurnah to form the Shatt al-Arab, which flows another 68 miles (109 km)
  into the Persian Gulf. The Tigris, all of whose tributaries are on its left (east)
  bank, runs close to the high Zagros Mountains, from which it receives a number of
  important tributaries, notably the Great Zab, the Little Zab, and the Diyālā. As
  a result, the Tigris can be subject to devastating floods, as evidenced by the many
  old channels left when the river carved out a new course. The period of maximum
  flow of the Tigris is from March to May, when more than two-fifths of the annual
  total discharge may be received. The Euphrates, whose flow is roughly 50 percent
  greater than that of the Tigris, receives no large tributaries in Iraq.Many dams
  are needed on the rivers and their tributaries to control flooding and permit irrigation.
  Iraq has giant irrigation projects at Bēkma, Bādūsh, and Al-Fatḥah. In the late
  1970s and early ’80s, Iraq completed a large-scale project that connected the Tigris
  and Euphrates. A canal emerges from the Tigris near Sāmarrāʾ and continues southwest
  to Lake Al-Tharthār, and another extends from the lake to the Euphrates near Al-Ḥabbāniyyah.
  This connection is crucial because in years of drought—aggravated by more recent
  upstream use of Euphrates water by Turkey and Syria—the river level is extremely
  low. In 1990 Syria and Iraq reached an agreement to share the water on the basis
  of 58 percent to Iraq and 42 percent to Syria of the total that enters Syria. Turkey,
  for its part, unilaterally promised to secure an annual minimum flow at its border
  with Syria. There is no tripartite agreement.Following the Persian Gulf War, the
  Iraqi government dedicated considerable resources to digging two large canals in
  the south of the country, with the apparent goal of improving irrigation and agricultural
  drainage. There is evidence, however, that these channels were also used to drain
  large parts of Iraq’s southern marshlands, from which rebel forces had carried out
  attacks against government forces. The first was reportedly designed to irrigate
  some 580 square miles (1,500 square km) of desert. The vast operation to create
  it produced a canal roughly 70 miles (115 km) long between Dhī Qār and Al-Baṣrah
  governorates. The second, an even grander scheme, was reportedly designed to irrigate
  an area some 10 times larger than the first. This canal, completed in 1992, extends
  from Al-Yūsufiyyah, 25 miles (40 km) south of Baghdad, to Al-Baṣrah, a total of
  some 350 miles (565 km).The two projects eventually drained some nine-tenths of
  Iraq’s southern marshes, once the largest wetlands system in the Middle East. Much
  of the drained area rapidly turned to arid salt flats. Following the start of the
  Iraq War in 2003, some parts of those projects were dismantled, but experts estimated
  that rehabilitation of the marshes would be impossible without extensive efforts
  and the expenditure of great resources.The desert regions have poorly developed
  soils of coarse texture containing many stones and unweathered rock fragments. Plant
  growth is limited because of aridity, and the humus content is low. In northwestern
  Iraq, soils vary considerably: some regions with steep slopes are badly eroded,
  while the river valleys and basins contain some light fertile soils. In northwest
  Al-Jazīrah, there is an area of potentially fertile soils similar to those found
  in much of the Fertile Crescent. Lowland Iraq is covered by heavy alluvial soils,
  with some organic content and a high proportion of clays, suitable for cultivation
  and for use as a building material.Salinity, caused in part by overirrigation, is
  a serious problem that affects about two-thirds of the land; as a result, large
  areas of agricultural land have had to be abandoned. A high water table and poor
  drainage, coupled with high rates of evaporation, cause alkaline salts to accumulate
  at or near the surface in sufficient quantities to limit agricultural productivity.
  Reversing the effect is a difficult and lengthy process.Heavy soil erosion in parts
  of Iraq, some of it induced by overgrazing and deforestation, leaves soils exposed
  to markedly seasonal rainfall. The Tigris-Euphrates river system has thus created
  a large alluvial deposit at its mouth, so that the Persian Gulf coast is much farther
  south than in Babylonian times.Iraq has two climatic provinces: the hot, arid lowlands,
  including the alluvial plains and the deserts; and the damper northeast, where the
  higher elevation produces cooler temperatures. In the northeast cultivation fed
  by precipitation is possible, but elsewhere irrigation is essential.In the lowlands
  there are two seasons, summer and winter, with short transitional periods between
  them. Summer, which lasts from May to October, is characterized by clear skies,
  extremely high temperatures, and low relative humidity; no precipitation occurs
  from June through September. In Baghdad, July and August mean daily temperatures
  are about 95 °F (35 °C), and summer temperatures of 123 °F (51 °C) have been recorded.
  The diurnal temperatures range in summer is considerable.In winter the paths of
  westerly atmospheric depressions crossing the Middle East shift southward, bringing
  rain to southern Iraq. Annual totals vary considerably from year to year, but mean
  annual precipitation in the lowlands ranges from about 4 to 7 inches (100 to 180
  mm); nearly all of this occurs between November and April.Winter in the lowlands
  lasts from December to February. Temperatures are generally mild, although extremes
  of hot and cold, including frosts, can occur. Winter temperatures in Baghdad range
  from about 35 to 60 °F (2 to 15 °C).In the northeast the summer is shorter than
  in the lowlands, lasting from June to September, and the winter considerably longer.
  The summer is generally dry and hot, but average temperatures are some 5–10 °F (3–6
  °C) cooler than those of lowland Iraq. Winters can be cold because of the region’s
  high relief and the influence of northeasterly winds that bring continental air
  from Central Asia. In Mosul (Al-Mawṣil), January temperatures range between 24 and
  63 °F (−4 and 17 °C); readings as low as 12 °F (−11 °C) have been recorded.In the
  foothills of the northeast, annual precipitation of 12 to 22 inches (300 to 560
  mm), enough to sustain good seasonal pasture, is typical. Precipitation may exceed
  40 inches (1,000 mm) in the mountains, much of which falls as snow. As in the lowlands,
  little rain falls during the summer.A steady northerly and northwesterly summer
  wind, the shamāl, affects all of Iraq. It brings extremely dry air, so hardly any
  clouds form, and the land surface is thus heated intensively by the sun. Another
  wind, the sharqī (Arabic: “easterly”), blows from the south and southeast during
  early summer and early winter; it is often accompanied by dust storms. Dust storms
  occur throughout Iraq during most of the year and may rise to great height in the
  atmosphere. They are particularly frequent in summer, with five or six striking
  central Iraq in July, the peak of the season.Vegetation in Iraq reflects the dominant
  influence of drought. Some Mediterranean and alpine plant species thrive in the
  mountains of Kurdistan, but the open oak forests that formerly were found there
  have largely disappeared. Hawthorns, junipers, terebinths, and wild pears grow on
  the lower mountain slopes. A steppe region of open, treeless vegetation is located
  in the area extending north and northeast from the Ḥamrīn Mountains up to the foothills
  and lower slopes of the mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan. A great variety of herbs and
  shrubs grow in that region. Most belong to the sage and daisy families: mugwort
  (Artemisis vulgaris), goosefoot, milkweed, thyme, and various rhizomic plants are
  examples. There also are many different grasses. Toward the riverine lowlands many
  other plants appear, including storksbill and plantain. Willows, tamarisks, poplars,
  licorice plants, and bulrushes grow along the banks of the lower Tigris and Euphrates
  rivers. The juice of the licorice plant is extracted for commercial purposes. Dozens
  of varieties of date palm flourish throughout southern Iraq, where the date palm
  dominates the landscape. The lakesides and marshlands support many varieties of
  reeds, sedges, pimpernels, vetches, and geraniums. By contrast, vegetation in the
  desert regions is sparse, with tamarisk, milfoil, and various plants of the genera
  Ziziphus and Salsola being characteristic.Euphrates River: marshland© Nik WheelerBirds
  are easily the most conspicuous form of wildlife. There are many resident species,
  though the effect of large-scale drainage of the southern wetlands on migrants and
  seasonal visitors—which were once numerous—has not been fully determined. The lion,
  oryx, ostrich, and wild ass have become extinct in Iraq. Wolves, foxes, jackals,
  hyenas, wild pigs, and wildcats are found, as well as many small animals such as
  martens, badgers, otters, porcupines, and muskrats. The Arabian sand gazelle survives
  in certain remote desert locations. Rivers, streams, and lakes are well stocked
  with a variety of fish, notably carp, various species of Barbus, catfish, and loach.
  In common with other regions of the Middle East, Iraq is a breeding ground for the
  unwelcome desert locust.Modern Iraq, created by combining three separate Ottoman
  provinces in the aftermath of World War I, is one of the most religiously and ethnically
  diverse societies in the Middle East. Although Iraq’s communities generally coexisted
  peacefully, fault lines between communities deepened in the 20th century as a succession
  of authoritarian regimes ruled by exploiting tribal, sectarian, and ethnic divisions.The
  ancient Semitic peoples of Iraq, the Babylonians and Assyrians, and the non-Semitic
  Sumerians were long ago assimilated by successive waves of immigrants. The Arab
  conquests of the 7th century brought about the Arabization of central and southern
  Iraq. A mixed population of Kurds and Arabs inhabit a transition zone between those
  areas and Iraqi Kurdistan in the northeast. Roughly two-thirds of Iraq’s people
  are Arabs, about one-fourth are Kurds, and the remainder consists of small minority
  groups.Iraq’s Arab population is divided between Sunni Muslims and the more numerous
  Shīʿites. These groups, however, are for the most part ethnically and linguistically
  homogenous, and—as is common throughout the region—both value family relations strongly.
  Many Arabs, in fact, identify more strongly with their family or tribe (an extended,
  patrilineal group) than with national or confessional affiliations, a significant
  factor contributing to ongoing difficulties in maintaining a strong central government.
  This challenge is amplified by the numerical size of many extended kin groups—tribal
  units may number thousands or tens of thousands of members—and the consequent political
  and economic clout they wield. Tribal affiliation among Arab groups has continued
  to play an important role in Iraqi politics, and even in areas where tribalism has
  eroded with time (such as major urban centres), family bonds have remained close.
  Several generations may live in a single household (although this is more common
  among rural families), and family-owned-and-operated businesses are the standard.
  Such households tend to be patriarchal, with the eldest male leading the family.Kurdish
  settlementEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Although estimates of their precise numbers
  vary, the Kurds are reckoned to be the fourth largest ethnic group in the Middle
  East, following Arabs, Turks, and Persians. There are important Kurdish minorities
  in Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria, and Iraq’s Kurds are concentrated in the relatively
  inaccessible mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan, which is roughly contiguous with Kurdish
  regions in those other countries. Kurds constitute a separate and distinctive cultural
  group. They are mostly Sunni Muslims who speak one of two dialects of the Kurdish
  language, an Indo-European language closely related to Modern Persian. They have
  a strong tribal structure and distinctive costume, music, and dance.The Kurdish
  people were thwarted in their ambitions for statehood after World War I, and the
  Iraqi Kurds have since resisted inclusion in the state of Iraq. At various times
  the Kurds have been in undisputed control of large tracts of territory. Attempts
  to reach a compromise with the Kurds in their demands for autonomy, however, have
  ended in failure, owing partly to government pressure and partly to the inability
  of Kurdish factional groups to maintain a united front against successive Iraqi
  governments. From 1961 to 1975, aided by military support from Iran, they were intermittently
  in open rebellion against the Iraqi government, as they were during the Iran-Iraq
  War in the 1980s and again, supported largely by the United States, throughout the
  1990s.After its rise to power, the Baʿth regime of Ṣaddām Ḥussein consistently tried
  to extend its control into Kurdish areas through threats, coercion, violence, and,
  at times, the forced internal transfer of large numbers of Kurds. Intermittent Kurdish
  rebellions in the last quarter of the 20th century killed tens of thousands of Kurds—both
  combatants and noncombatants—at the hands of government forces and on various occasions
  forced hundreds of thousands of Kurds to flee to neighbouring Iran and Turkey. Government
  attacks were violent and ruthless and included the use of chemical weapons against
  Kurdish civilians; such incidents took place at the village of Ḥalabjah and elsewhere
  in 1988.Following a failed Kurdish uprising in the wake of the Persian Gulf War,
  the United States and other members of the coalition that it led against Iraq established
  a “safe haven” for the Kurds in an area north of latitude 36° N that was under the
  protection of the international community. Thereafter the Kurds were largely autonomous.
  Kurdish autonomy is upheld in the 2005 constitution, which designates Kurdistan
  as an autonomous federal region.Small communities of Turks, Turkmen, and Assyrians
  survive in northern Iraq. The Lur, a group speaking an Iranian language, live near
  the Iranian border. In addition, a small number of Armenians are found predominantly
  in Baghdad and in pockets throughout the north.More than three-fourths of the people
  speak Arabic, the official language, which has several major dialects; these are
  generally mutually intelligible, but significant variations do exist within the
  country, which makes spoken parlance between some groups (and with Arabic-speaking
  groups in adjacent countries) difficult. Modern Standard Arabic—the benchmark of
  literacy—is taught in schools, and most Arabs and many non-Arabs, even those who
  lack schooling, are able to understand it. Roughly one-fifth of the population speaks
  Kurdish, in one of its two main dialects. Kurdish is the official language in the
  Kurdish Autonomous Region in the north. A number of other languages are spoken by
  smaller ethnic groups, including Turkish, Turkmen, Azerbaijanian, and Syriac. Persian,
  once commonly spoken, is now seldom heard. Bilingualism is fairly common, particularly
  among minorities who are conversant in Arabic. English is widely used in commerce.Iraq
  is predominantly a Muslim country, in which the two major sects of Islam are represented
  more equally than in any other state. Slightly more than half (and according to
  some sources as many as three-fifths) of the population are Shīʿite, and about two-fifths
  are Sunni. Largely for political reasons, the government has not maintained careful
  statistics on the relative proportion of the Sunni and Shīʿite populations. Shīʿites
  are almost exclusively Arab (with some Turkmen and Kurds), while Sunnis are divided
  mainly between Arabs and Kurds but include other, smaller groups, such as Azerbaijanis
  and Turkmen.From the inception of the Iraqi state in 1920 until the fall of the
  government of Ṣaddām Ḥussein in 2003, the ruling elites consisted mainly—although
  not exclusively—of minority Sunni Arabs. Most Sunni Arabs follow the Ḥanafī school
  of jurisprudence and most Kurds the Shāfiʿī school, although this distinction has
  lost the meaning that it had in earlier times.Iraq’s Shīʿites, like their coreligionists
  in Iran, follow the Ithnā ʿAsharī, or Twelver, rite, and, despite the preeminence
  of Iran as a Shīʿite Islamic republic, Iraq has traditionally been the physical
  and spiritual centre of Shīʿism in the Islamic world. Shīʿism’s two most important
  holy cities, Al-Najaf and Karbalāʾ, are located in southern Iraq, as is Al-Kūfah,
  sanctified as the site of the assassination of ʿAlī, the fourth caliph, in the 7th
  century. Sāmarrāʾ, farther north, near Baghdad, is also of great cultural and religious
  significance to Shīʿites as the site of the life and disappearance of the 12th,
  and eponymous, imam, Muḥammad al-Mahdī al-Ḥujjah. In premodern times southern and
  eastern Iraq formed a cultural and religious meeting place between the Arab and
  Persian Shīʿite worlds, and religious scholars moved freely between the two regions.
  Even until relatively recent times, large numbers of notable Iranian scholars could
  be found studying or teaching in the great madrasahs (religious schools) in Al-Najaf
  and Karbalāʾ; the Iranian cleric Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, for instance, spent
  many years lecturing at Al-Najaf while in exile. Although Shīʿites constituted the
  majority of the population, Iraq’s Sunnī rulers gave preferential treatment to influential
  Sunnī tribal networks, and Sunnīs dominated the military officer corps and civil
  service. Shīʿites remained politically and economically marginalized until the fall
  of Ṣaddām Ḥussein’s regime. Since the transition to elective government, Shīʿite
  factions have wielded significant political power.Followers of other religions include
  Christians and even smaller groups of Yazīdīs, Mandaeans, Jews, and Bahāʾīs. (See
  Mandaeanism; Bahāʾī faith.) The nearly extinct Jewish community traces its origins
  to the Babylonian Exile (586–516 bc). Jews formerly constituted a small but significant
  minority and were largely concentrated in or around Baghdad, but, with the rise
  of Zionism, anti-Jewish feelings became widespread. This tension eventually led
  to the massive Farhūd pogrom of June 1941. With the establishment of Israel in 1948,
  most Jews emigrated there or elsewhere. The Christian communities are chiefly descendants
  of the ancient population that was not converted to Islam in the 7th century. They
  are subdivided among various sects, including Nestorians (Assyrians), Chaldeans—who
  broke with the Nestorians in the 16th century and are now affiliated with the Roman
  Catholic Church—and members of the Syriac Orthodox  and Eastern Orthodox churches.
  About one million Christians lived in Iraq when the Iraq War began. International
  organizations estimate that more than half have left the country since then, mostly
  to escape poverty and violence by Muslim extremists.Iraq has a relatively low population
  density overall, but, in the fertile lowlands and the cities, densities are nearly
  four times the national average.The distribution of towns and villages in Iraq follows
  basic patterns established thousands of years ago. Although the proportion of urban
  dwellers has risen over time, about one-third of Iraqis still live in rural areas.
  Today several thousand villages and hamlets are scattered unevenly throughout the
  two-thirds of Iraq that is permanently settled. The greatest concentration of villages
  is in the valleys and lowlands around the Tigris and Euphrates. Most have between
  100 and 2,000 houses, traditionally clustered tightly for defensive purposes. Their
  populations are engaged almost exclusively in agriculture, although essential services
  are located in the larger villages.Villages in the foothills and mountains of the
  largely Kurdish northeast tend to be smaller and more isolated than those of lowland
  Iraq, which befits a lifestyle that is based on animal husbandry and only rarely
  on agriculture. The arid and semiarid areas in the west and south have sparse populations.
  The arid regions, along with the extensive Al-Jazīrah region northwest of Baghdad,
  were traditionally inhabited by nomadic Bedouin tribes, but few of these people
  remain in Iraq. Another lifestyle under threat is that of the Shīʿite marsh dwellers
  (Madan) of southern Iraq. They traditionally have lived in reed dwellings built
  on brushwood foundations or sandspits, but the damage done to the marshes in the
  1990s has largely undermined their way of living. Rice, fish, and edible rushes
  have been staples, supplemented by products of the water buffalo.citadelDiane Rawson/Photo
  ResearchersMore than two-thirds of Iraq’s population are urban dwellers, and almost
  two-fifths of those are concentrated in the five largest cities: Baghdad, Al-Baṣrah,
  Mosul, Arbīl, and Al-Sulaymāniyyah. There are also a considerable number of small
  towns, many of which are market centres, provincial capitals, or the headquarters
  of smaller local government districts. Attempts to stimulate the growth of selected
  small towns have had only modest success, and government efforts to stem the tide
  of people departing rural areas, through agricultural reform and other measures,
  have largely failed.Karkh, Al-Steve McCurry/Magnum PhotosFor a variety of reasons,
  rural migrants have been particularly drawn to Baghdad, the country’s political,
  economic, and communications hub. First, to minimize the danger of riots in the
  capital city, the Baʿth regime—in addition to a variety of security measures—made
  special efforts to maintain a minimal level of public services, even in the poorest
  neighbourhoods. This was especially important after the UN imposed an extended embargo
  on Iraqi trade in response to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, making food rationing
  more necessary than ever before. Distributing rations was more efficient in the
  capital area. Second, chances for employment typically have been better in Baghdad
  than in other cities. This was true as early as the 1930s, when migrants began to
  move to the city. Since that time, Shīʿite Arabs from the south have been the largest
  migrant group in the city, a trend that was enhanced during the Iran-Iraq War as
  many refugees fled the southern war zones. Efforts to limit this influx, and even
  to reverse it, met with only limited success, and, by the beginning of the 21st
  century, Shīʿite Arabs represented a majority in the capital. The poor Shīʿite-Arab
  Al-Thawrah (“Revolution”) quarter—known informally since 2003 as Ṣadr City after
  Muḥammad Ṣādiq al-Ṣadr, a murdered Shīʿite cleric—alone houses more than a million
  people. Prior to the Iraq War, many Baghdad neighbourhoods contained a mix of Sunnī
  and Shiʿīte residents. These neighbourhoods became homogeneous as residents moved
  to safer areas amid the sectarian bloodshed that peaked around 2006. It is estimated
  that one-fifth of the country’s people live in the governorate of Baghdad, almost
  all of them in the city itself.It is no coincidence that Baghdad’s celebrated predecessors,
  Babylon and the Sāsānian capital, Ctesiphon, were located in the same general region.
  Baghdad, itself a city of legend, is located at the heart of what has long been
  a rich agricultural region, and the modern city is the undisputed commercial, manufacturing,
  and service capital of Iraq. Its growth, however, has necessitated costly projects,
  including elaborate flood-prevention schemes completed largely in the 1950s, the
  rehousing of hundreds of thousands of inhabitants of squalid shantytowns (ṣarīfahs)
  in the 1960s (and, on a much smaller scale, in 1979–80), and the construction of
  major domestic water and sewerage projects. The city was damaged during both the
  Persian Gulf War and the Iraq War and required major reconstruction of all parts
  of the infrastructure.Al-Baṣrah, on the west bank of the Shatt al-Arab and formerly
  Iraq’s main port, is the centre of its southern petroleum sector and the hub of
  the country’s date cultivation. One of the great cities of Islamic history and heritage,
  it was badly damaged and largely depopulated during the Iran-Iraq War and, though
  partially reconstructed following that conflict, again suffered during the Persian
  Gulf War and subsequent fighting between Shīʿite rebels and government forces. Much
  of the city’s infrastructure (sewerage and potable water and health care facilities)
  remained in a state of disarray, with dire results for public health. Al-Baṣrah’s
  function as a port has been taken over by Umm Qaṣr, a small deepwater port on the
  gulf.Iraq’s third city, though now its second largest in terms of population, is
  Mosul, which is situated on the Tigris near the ruins of the ancient Assyrian capital
  of Nineveh. Mosul is the centre for the upper Tigris basin, specializing in processing
  and marketing agricultural and animal products. It has grown rapidly, partly as
  a result of the influx of Kurdish refugees fleeing government repression in Iraqi
  Kurdistan. By the end of the 1990s, Mosul too had suffered from government neglect,
  and, relative to Baghdad, its infrastructure and health care facilities were in
  poor condition.Iraq has the fourth largest population in the Middle East, after
  Iran, Egypt, and Turkey. Yet demographic information since 1980 has been difficult
  to obtain and interpret, and outside observers often have been forced to use estimates.
  From 1990 a UN embargo on Iraq, which made travel to and from the country difficult,
  contributed considerably to the lack of information, but most important was the
  rule of more than 30 years by the Baʿthist regime, which was intent on controlling
  the flow of information about the country. The former Iraqi government sought to
  downplay unflattering demographic shifts in its Kurdish and Shīʿite communities
  while highlighting the effects of the UN embargo on health, nutrition, and overall
  mortality—particularly among the country’s children.UN studies indicate that general
  levels of health and nutrition declined markedly after the introduction of the embargo
  in 1990 and before Iraq accepted the provisions of a UN program in late 1996 that
  allowed Iraq to sell a set quantity of oil in order to purchase food, medicine,
  and other human necessities. This situation led to substantial declines in the rates
  of birth, natural increase, and fertility and a noticeable increase in the death
  rate. Overall vital statistics in Iraq during the 1990s, however, remained above
  world averages and by the 21st century had begun to return to their prewar levels.Because
  of Iraq’s relatively low population density, the government has long promoted a
  policy of population growth, and although it is estimated that more than two-fifths
  of the population is under 15 years of age, the total fertility rate has declined
  since its peak during the late 1960s. This decline apparently resulted from the
  casualties of the two major wars—reaching possibly as many as a half million young
  and early-adult men—and subsequent difficulties related to the UN embargo, as well
  as an overall sense of insecurity among Iraqis. For the same reasons, it is reckoned
  that the rate of natural increase, though still high by world standards, had dropped
  markedly by the mid-1990s before it likewise rebounded.The associated hardships
  of the early to mid-1990s persuaded a number of Iraqis—at least those who were wealthy
  enough and willing to risk the wrath of the regime—to either leave the country or
  seek haven in the northern Kurdish region, where, thanks to international aid and
  a freer market, living conditions improved noticeably during the 1990s. Moreover,
  an estimated one to two million Iraqis—many of them unregistered refugees—fled the
  country to various destinations (including Iran, Syria, and Jordan) out of direct
  fear of government reprisal. During the Iraq War, more than 1.6 million Iraqis fled
  the country and more than 1.2 million were displaced internally.Beyond the out-migration
  of a significant number of Iraqis, the major demographic trends in the country since
  the 1970s have been forced relocation—particularly of the Iranian population and,
  more recently, of the Kurds—forced ethnic homogenization, and urbanization. Eastern
  Iraq has traditionally formed part of a transition zone between the Arab and Persian
  worlds, and, until the Baʿth regime came to power in 1968, a significant number
  of ethnic Persians lived in the country (in the same way large numbers of ethnic
  Arabs reside in Iran). Between 1969 and 1980, however, they—and many Arabs whom
  the regime defined as Persian—were deported to Iran.Kurds have traditionally populated
  the northeast, and Sunni Arabs have traditionally predominated in central Iraq.
  During the 1980s the Baʿth regime forcibly moved tens of thousands of Kurds from
  regions along the Iranian border, with many Kurds dying in the process, and subsequently
  relocated large numbers of Arabs to areas traditionally inhabited by Kurds, particularly
  in and around the city of Kirkūk. Kurds in those regions have, likewise, been expelled,
  and many of Iraq’s estimated half million internally displaced persons prior to
  the Iraq War were Kurds. Further, the regime systematically compelled large numbers
  of Kurds and members of smaller ethnic groups to change their ethnic identity, forcing
  them to declare themselves Arabs. Those not acquiescing to this pressure faced expulsion,
  physical abuse, and imprisonment.Iraqis have been slowly migrating to urban areas
  since the 1930s. Population mobility and urban growth have, to some extent, created
  a religious and cultural mix in several large cities, particularly in Baghdad. (There
  has been little change in the overall ethnic patterns of the country, however, except
  through instances of forced migration.) Many Kurds have moved either to larger towns
  in Kurdistan or to larger cities such as Mosul or Baghdad. Few Kurds have moved
  willingly to the south, where Arab Shīʿites have traditionally predominated. The
  latter have moved in substantial numbers to larger towns in the south or, particularly
  during the fighting in the 1980s, to largely Shīʿite neighbourhoods in Baghdad.
  Sunnis migrating from rural areas have moved mostly to areas of Baghdad with majorities
  of their ethnic and religious affinities.From the mid-1970s until 1990, labour shortages
  drew large numbers of foreign workers, particularly Egyptians, to Iraq; at its height
  the number of Egyptians may have exceeded two million. Virtually all foreign workers
  left the country prior to the Persian Gulf War, and few, if any, have returned.1Includes
