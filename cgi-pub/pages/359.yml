- "\t\t\t\t\t\n"
- "\t\t\t\t\tThe United States was the first modern nation to win independence through
  a successful revolution against colonial rule. It set a precedent that was followed
  in the 19th century by nations across Latin America and in the 20th century by nations
  in Asia and Africa. Like those other countries, the United States faced severe political,
  economic, and foreign policy problems after achieving independence.    \r\n"
- "In this section you will learn about how the United States addressed those problems
  and established a stable political and economic system. You will learn about the
  creation of new state governments and a new federal government based on the principles
  of popular sovereignty, rule of law, and legislation by elected representatives.
  You will also learn about the internal difficulties besetting the new republic,
  such as financing the war, the threat of a military coup, a hard-hitting economic
  depression, and popular demands for tax relief. In addition, you will read about
  efforts to expand freedom of religion, to increase women's educational opportunities,
  and to address the problem of slavery.     \r\n"
- "Other important topics include the drafting and ratification of the Constitution;
  the adoption of a bill of rights protecting the rights of the individual against
  the power of the central government; the enactment of a financial program that secured
  the government's credit and stimulated the economy; and the creation of the first
  political parties to involve the voting population in national politics.    \r\n"
- "In addition, you will learn about the purchase of Louisiana Territory from France;
  British and French interference with American shipping; the causes, fighting, and
  consequences of the War of 1812.     \r\n"
- "Summary:    \r\n"
- "The United States faced severe economic and foreign policy problems. A huge debt
  remained from the Revolution; paper money issued during and after the war was worthless;
  and Britain and Spain occupied territory claimed by the United States.    \r\n"
- "The new nation lacked the machinery of government. It consisted of nothing more
  than 75 post offices, a large debt, a small number of unpaid clerks, and an army
  consisting of just 672 soldiers. There was no federal court system, no navy, and
  no system for collecting taxes. Congress enacted a tariff to raise revenue; created
  departments of state, treasury and war; and organized a federal judicial system.
  \   \r\n"
- "To strengthen popular support for the new government, Congress approved a Bill
  of Rights in the form of ten amendments to the Constitution protecting the rights
  of the individual against the power of the central government.    \r\n"
- "The Constitution provided only a broad outline of the office and powers of the
  president, and it was up to the first president, George Washington, to establish
  many precedents. He modeled the executive branch along the lines of a general's
  staff. He asserted the power to dismiss presidential appointees without the Senate's
  permission. He negotiated treaties and then sent them to the Senate for ratification.
  \   \r\n"
- "To secure the nation's credit, the first Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton,
  had the federal government assume the entire indebtedness of the federal government
  and the states. To issue currency, collect taxes, hold government funds, regulate
  private banks, and make loans, he recommended that the federal government establish
  a Bank of the United States. His other proposals to stimulate manufacturing through
  high tariffs, bounties, encouragement of immigration, and federal aid for roads
  were defeated.    \r\n"
- "By 1796, the United States had produced the world's first modern political parties.
  Opposition to Hamiltonâ\x80\x99s plans intensified during the closing years of Washingtonâ\x80\x99s
  first term. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison feared that Hamilton wanted to model
  American society along the lines of monarchical England. Partisan divisions deepened
  in response to the French Revolution and the wars between France and Britain. The
  Jeffersonians supported the French; the Hamiltonians, the British. President Washington
  supported a policy of neutrality.    \r\n"
- "During 1793 and 1794, Washingtonâ\x80\x99s administration confronted a French effort
  to entangle America in its war with England (the Genet Affair), armed rebellion
  in western Pennsylvania (the Whiskey Rebellion), conflicts with Indians, and the
  threat of war with Britain. In 1796, Washington was able to retire gracefully. He
  had suppressed the Whiskey Rebellion, defeated an Indian confederacy in the Ohio
  country, and negotiated Britain out of its western forts. In a Farewell Address,
  he called on Americans to avoid political partisanship and entangling alliances
  with foreign nations.    \r\n"
- "Deteriorating relations with France during the presidency of John Adams resulted
  in an undeclared naval war and prompted Federalists in Congress to enact the infamous
  Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798. These acts were designed to silence dissent and
  weaken support for the Jeffersonian Republicans, prompting Jefferson and Madison
  to draft the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions that advanced the idea that states
  had the power to declare acts of Congress null and void.    \r\n"
- "Thomas Jefferson was convinced that the Federalists had threatened republican government
  by levying oppressive taxes, stretching the provisions of the Constitution, and
  subverting civil liberties. As president, he slashed army and navy expenditures
  and eliminated most federal taxes. To encourage land ownership, he persuaded Congress
  to cut the price of public lands. He also moved Congress to reduce the residence
  requirement for citizenship, and freed all people imprisoned under the Sedition
  Act and refunded their fines.    \r\n"
- "It was during Jeffersonâ\x80\x99s presidency that the Supreme Court asserted the
  power of judicial supremacy and judicial review and became a vigorous and equal
  third branch of government. The acquisition of Louisiana Territory from France in
  1803 doubled the country's size.    \r\n"
- "During Jefferson's second term the United States became embroiled in the Napoleonic
  wars, as Britain and France interfered with American shipping. To assert Americaâ\x80\x99s
  neutral rights, Congress adopted an embargo prohibiting American trade with foreign
  countries. An unpopular and costly failure, the embargo provoked widespread smuggling.
  \   \r\n"
- "By 1812, many Americans believed that only war with Britain could preserve Americans
  neutral rights and national honor. American grievances included interference with
  American trade, impressment of thousands of American sailors, and incitement of
  Indian attacks.    \r\n"
- "The War of 1812 was crucial to the future of the United States. It effectively
  destroyed Indians' ability to resist American expansion. It allowed the United States
  to solidify its control over the lower Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.
  It encouraged New England merchants to invest in textile factories. It also ended
  Americaâ\x80\x99s brief experiment with a two party political system, as the Federalists
  were branded as traitors for failing to support the war.    \r\n"
- "Following the War of 1812, a spirit of nationalism pervaded the nation, evident
  in the creation of a second Bank of the United States; enactment of a tariff to
  protect industry, and a series of Supreme Court decisions strengthening the power
  of the central government. The United States acquired Florida from Spain, convinced
  Russia and Spain to relinquish their claims to the Oregon country, and delivered
  a strong warning, in the Monroe Doctrine, that European powers were not to interfere
  in the Western Hemisphere.    \r\n"
- "A severe economic depression, the Panic of 1819, and a bitter controversy over
  slavery in Missouri in 1819 and 1820, provoked growing political divisions and a
  deepening sectional split between North and South. \n"

- "\t\t\t\t\tThe United States was the first modern nation to win independence through
  a successful revolution against colonial rule. It set a precedent that was followed
  in the 19th century by nations across Latin America and in the 20th century by nations
  in Asia and Africa. Like those other countries, the United States faced severe political,
  economic, and foreign policy problems after achieving independence.    \r\n"
- "In this section you will learn about how the United States addressed those problems
  and established a stable political and economic system. You will learn about the
  creation of new state governments and a new federal government based on the principles
  of popular sovereignty, rule of law, and legislation by elected representatives.
  You will also learn about the internal difficulties besetting the new republic,
  such as financing the war, the threat of a military coup, a hard-hitting economic
  depression, and popular demands for tax relief. In addition, you will read about
  efforts to expand freedom of religion, to increase women's educational opportunities,
  and to address the problem of slavery.     \r\n"
- "Other important topics include the drafting and ratification of the Constitution;
  the adoption of a bill of rights protecting the rights of the individual against
  the power of the central government; the enactment of a financial program that secured
  the government's credit and stimulated the economy; and the creation of the first
  political parties to involve the voting population in national politics.    \r\n"
- "In addition, you will learn about the purchase of Louisiana Territory from France;
  British and French interference with American shipping; the causes, fighting, and
  consequences of the War of 1812.     \r\n"
- "Summary:    \r\n"
- "The United States faced severe economic and foreign policy problems. A huge debt
  remained from the Revolution; paper money issued during and after the war was worthless;
  and Britain and Spain occupied territory claimed by the United States.    \r\n"
- "The new nation lacked the machinery of government. It consisted of nothing more
  than 75 post offices, a large debt, a small number of unpaid clerks, and an army
  consisting of just 672 soldiers. There was no federal court system, no navy, and
  no system for collecting taxes. Congress enacted a tariff to raise revenue; created
  departments of state, treasury and war; and organized a federal judicial system.
  \   \r\n"
- "To strengthen popular support for the new government, Congress approved a Bill
  of Rights in the form of ten amendments to the Constitution protecting the rights
  of the individual against the power of the central government.    \r\n"
- "The Constitution provided only a broad outline of the office and powers of the
  president, and it was up to the first president, George Washington, to establish
  many precedents. He modeled the executive branch along the lines of a general's
  staff. He asserted the power to dismiss presidential appointees without the Senate's
  permission. He negotiated treaties and then sent them to the Senate for ratification.
  \   \r\n"
- "To secure the nation's credit, the first Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton,

  Version\n\t\t\t\t\tOverview of the Early National Period Digital History ID 2911\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe
  United States was the first modern nation to win independence through a successful
  revolution against colonial rule. It set a precedent that was followed in the 19th
  century by nations across Latin America and in the 20th century by nations in Asia
  and Africa. Like those other countries, the United States faced severe political,
  economic, and foreign policy problems after achieving independence.    \r\nIn this
  section you will learn about how the United States addressed those problems and
  established a stable political and economic system. You will learn about the creation
  of new state governments and a new federal government based on the principles of
  popular sovereignty, rule of law, and legislation by elected representatives. You
  will also learn about the internal difficulties besetting the new republic, such
  as financing the war, the threat of a military coup, a hard-hitting economic depression,
  and popular demands for tax relief. In addition, you will read about efforts to
  expand freedom of religion, to increase women's educational opportunities, and to
  address the problem of slavery.     \r\nOther important topics include the drafting
  and ratification of the Constitution; the adoption of a bill of rights protecting
  the rights of the individual against the power of the central government; the enactment
  of a financial program that secured the government's credit and stimulated the economy;
  and the creation of the first political parties to involve the voting population
  in national politics.    \r\nIn addition, you will learn about the purchase of Louisiana
  Territory from France; British and French interference with American shipping; the
  causes, fighting, and consequences of the War of 1812.     \r\nSummary:    \r\nThe
  United States faced severe economic and foreign policy problems. A huge debt remained
  from the Revolution; paper money issued during and after the war was worthless;
  and Britain and Spain occupied territory claimed by the United States.    \r\nThe
  new nation lacked the machinery of government. It consisted of nothing more than
  75 post offices, a large debt, a small number of unpaid clerks, and an army consisting
  of just 672 soldiers. There was no federal court system, no navy, and no system
  for collecting taxes. Congress enacted a tariff to raise revenue; created departments
  of state, treasury and war; and organized a federal judicial system.    \r\nTo strengthen
  popular support for the new government, Congress approved a Bill of Rights in the
  form of ten amendments to the Constitution protecting the rights of the individual
  against the power of the central government.    \r\nThe Constitution provided only
  a broad outline of the office and powers of the president, and it was up to the
  first president, George Washington, to establish many precedents. He modeled the
  executive branch along the lines of a general's staff. He asserted the power to
  dismiss presidential appointees without the Senate's permission. He negotiated treaties
  and then sent them to the Senate for ratification.    \r\nTo secure the nation's
  credit, the first Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton, had the federal government
  assume the entire indebtedness of the federal government and the states. To issue
  currency, collect taxes, hold government funds, regulate private banks, and make
  loans, he recommended that the federal government establish a Bank of the United
  States. His other proposals to stimulate manufacturing through high tariffs, bounties,
  encouragement of immigration, and federal aid for roads were defeated.    \r\nBy
  1796, the United States had produced the world's first modern political parties.
  Opposition to Hamiltonâ\x80\x99s plans intensified during the closing years of Washingtonâ\x80\x99s
  first term. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison feared that Hamilton wanted to model
  American society along the lines of monarchical England. Partisan divisions deepened
  in response to the French Revolution and the wars between France and Britain. The
  Jeffersonians supported the French; the Hamiltonians, the British. President Washington
  supported a policy of neutrality.    \r\nDuring 1793 and 1794, Washingtonâ\x80\x99s
  administration confronted a French effort to entangle America in its war with England
  (the Genet Affair), armed rebellion in western Pennsylvania (the Whiskey Rebellion),
  conflicts with Indians, and the threat of war with Britain. In 1796, Washington
  was able to retire gracefully. He had suppressed the Whiskey Rebellion, defeated
  an Indian confederacy in the Ohio country, and negotiated Britain out of its western
  forts. In a Farewell Address, he called on Americans to avoid political partisanship
  and entangling alliances with foreign nations.    \r\nDeteriorating relations with
  France during the presidency of John Adams resulted in an undeclared naval war and
  prompted Federalists in Congress to enact the infamous Alien and Sedition Acts in
  1798. These acts were designed to silence dissent and weaken support for the Jeffersonian
  Republicans, prompting Jefferson and Madison to draft the Virginia and Kentucky
  Resolutions that advanced the idea that states had the power to declare acts of
  Congress null and void.    \r\nThomas Jefferson was convinced that the Federalists
  had threatened republican government by levying oppressive taxes, stretching the
  provisions of the Constitution, and subverting civil liberties. As president, he
  slashed army and navy expenditures and eliminated most federal taxes. To encourage
  land ownership, he persuaded Congress to cut the price of public lands. He also
  moved Congress to reduce the residence requirement for citizenship, and freed all
  people imprisoned under the Sedition Act and refunded their fines.    \r\nIt was
  during Jeffersonâ\x80\x99s presidency that the Supreme Court asserted the power
  of judicial supremacy and judicial review and became a vigorous and equal third
  branch of government. The acquisition of Louisiana Territory from France in 1803
  doubled the country's size.    \r\nDuring Jefferson's second term the United States
  became embroiled in the Napoleonic wars, as Britain and France interfered with American
  shipping. To assert Americaâ\x80\x99s neutral rights, Congress adopted an embargo
  prohibiting American trade with foreign countries. An unpopular and costly failure,
  the embargo provoked widespread smuggling.    \r\nBy 1812, many Americans believed
  that only war with Britain could preserve Americans neutral rights and national
  honor. American grievances included interference with American trade, impressment
  of thousands of American sailors, and incitement of Indian attacks.    \r\nThe War
  of 1812 was crucial to the future of the United States. It effectively destroyed
  Indians' ability to resist American expansion. It allowed the United States to solidify
  its control over the lower Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. It encouraged
  New England merchants to invest in textile factories. It also ended Americaâ\x80\x99s
  brief experiment with a two party political system, as the Federalists were branded
  as traitors for failing to support the war.    \r\nFollowing the War of 1812, a
  spirit of nationalism pervaded the nation, evident in the creation of a second Bank
  of the United States; enactment of a tariff to protect industry, and a series of
  Supreme Court decisions strengthening the power of the central government. The United
  States acquired Florida from Spain, convinced Russia and Spain to relinquish their
  claims to the Oregon country, and delivered a strong warning, in the Monroe Doctrine,
  that European powers were not to interfere in the Western Hemisphere.    \r\nA severe
  economic depression, the Panic of 1819, and a bitter controversy over slavery in
  Missouri in 1819 and 1820, provoked growing political divisions and a deepening
  sectional split between North and South. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\r\n\tvar gaJsHost
