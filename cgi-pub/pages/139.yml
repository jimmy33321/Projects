He argues that the ethical requirements logically imposed on individual action hold equally for the supportive state as a community of rights, whose chief function is to maintain and promote the universal human rights to freedom and well-being. Such social afflictions as unemployment, homelessness, and poverty are basic violations of these rights, which the supportive state is required to overcome. A critical alternative to both "liberal" and "communitarian" views, this book will command the attention of anyone engaged in the debate over social and economic justice.  if (window['_OC_autoDir']) {_OC_autoDir('search_form_input');}Preview this book » if (window['_OC_reportEvent']) { window['_OC_reportEvent']('summary'); }What people are saying - Write a reviewThe community of rightsUser Review  - Not Available - Book VerdictBeginning this sequel to Reason and Morality (LJ 2/15/78) with a brief account of his Principle of Generic Consistency (PGC), on which he based the morality of that book, Gewirth extends the PGC to ...

He argues that the ethical requirements logically imposed on individual action hold equally for the supportive state as a community of rights, whose chief function is to maintain and promote the universal human rights to freedom and well-being. Such social afflictions as unemployment, homelessness, and poverty are basic violations of these rights, which the supportive state is required to overcome. A critical alternative to both "liberal" and "communitarian" views, this book will command the attention of anyone engaged in the debate over social and economic justice.  if (window['_OC_autoDir']) {_OC_autoDir('search_form_input');}Preview this book » if (window['_OC_reportEvent']) { window['_OC_reportEvent']('summary'); }What people are saying - Write a reviewThe community of rightsUser Review  - Not Available - Book VerdictBeginning this sequel to Reason and Morality (LJ 2/15/78) with a brief account of his Principle of Generic Consistency (PGC), on which he based the morality of that book, Gewirth extends the PGC to ...
