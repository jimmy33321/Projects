                  APPEARANCE AND REALITY
- "                \n"
- |2
                  The general sense of the contrast between
- |2
                      appearance and reality would be any difference between what is the
- |2
                      case and what appears to be so. Thus, the ordinary appearance of a person
- |2
                      frequently conceals his real feelings and thoughts, the appearance of a
- |2
                      village may be one of tranquility, but the reality one of turmoil,
- |2
                      hatred, etc. The more specific sense of this contrast arose out of
- |2
                      philosophical concerns about the nature of the world. The concept of
- |2
                      “world” and of “reality” in
- |2
                      this philosophical concern is related to but different from the ordinary
- |2
                      concept. Early Greek cosmologists interpreted the perceived world in terms
- |2
                      of causal and intentional forces of the gods. Pre-Socratic philoso- phers, searching for secular
- |2
                      explanations, came to draw a sharp contrast between the perceived world and
- |2
                      the ultimate “real stuff.” Water, air, atoms,
- |2
                      abstract notions like “unlimited” or
- |2
                      “boundless,” and “mind” were
- |2
                      offered as the stuff of which the world is really made or in terms of which
- |2
                      understanding of the world must be made. Greek atomism is a prime example.
- |2
                      All observed properties and qualities of objects were explained in
- |2
                      terms of the shape and motion of insensi- ble
- |2
                      material particles. This account of reality was not only important in
- |2
                      itself, it was, at least to Lucretius later, of ethical and emotional value
- |2
                      in leading man via understanding to happiness (cf. Spinoza).
- |2
                  The atomistic way of thinking of the cause and ground of the perceived world
- |2
                      is easiest for us to accept since it fits in well with the early forms of
- |2
                      atomism in modern physics. As recent science has moved to more and
- |2
                      more abstractions, e.g., energy, force, fields, etc., the analogy of real
- |2
                      world to the perceived world has given way. Those abstract concepts in
- |2
                      Greek thought—the boundless, Parmenides' One, Plato's
- |2
                      Forms—likewise required a different mode of thought for their
- |2
                      understanding. Even though Parmenides may have thought of the One as in
- |2
                      some way physical, the geometrical concepts easily emerged from his concep- tualization of the One. The
- |2
                      contrast between what appears to be the case and what is in fact so is
- |2
                      sharp and striking. Parmenides' recommendation, again as much for
- |2
                      moral as for intellectual reasons, was to turn our backs on the way of
- |2
                      appearance and to contem- plate the way of
- |2
                      truth and reality. The contrast was so complete that sense experience was
- |2
                      contradictory to reality: what the senses report cannot be true since
- |2
                      motion is unreal. The paradoxes of Zeno simply played upon this Parmenidean
- |2
                      contrast of appearance and reality. The senses are denied, are unreal.
- |2
                  This striking Parmenidean contrast set many prob-
- |2
                      lems for Plato and subsequent philosophers. The chal- lenge of the paradoxes had to be met, one cannot carry
- |2
                       out Parmenides' radical denial of all that our senses report.
- |2
                      The most fundamental difficulty in a concept of reality such as Parmenides
- |2
                      advanced is the implied if not explicit denial to the perceived world of
- |2
                          any status in reality. Bradley was much later to
- |2
                      point out that, no matter how different our philosophy may make
- |2
                      appearances from reality, there is an important sense in which the
- |2
                      appearances must occupy some place in reality. The Bradleyan concept of
- |2
                      reality owes much to Hegel, where radical contrasts and differences
- |2
                      tend to disappear in a dialectical flow: reality becomes the totality
- |2
                      of that which is, Spinoza's facies totius
- |2
                      Universi (“the whole aspect of the
- |2
                      universe”). But quite apart from such an Hegelian transformation
- |2
                      of the concept of reality, there is an important truth in the
- |2
                      insistence that anything, appearances as well as nonappearances,are in some sense. At least the status is that they exist as appearances. Plato put the point
- |2
                      trenchantly in having Socrates ask (Republic V,
- |2
                      476D), “When you know something, do you know something that is
- |2
                      or something that is not?” The conclusion from this ques- tion has to be (as both Plato and
- |2
                      Parmenides agreed) that that which is not can neither be nor be conceived.
- |2
                  To make room for sense perception which reveals a world of change and
- |2
                      motion, of diversity and differ- ence, Plato
- |2
                      elaborated a conception of different degrees and kinds of realness. The
- |2
                      most real—his Forms—fulfill the role of reality in
- |2
                      the more simple notions of appearance and reality: the Forms play
- |2
                      causal, semantic, and moral roles. The intellectual understanding of the
- |2
                      Forms has an alternate, aesthetic mode. Both modes are sought for social,
- |2
                      political, and ethical enlightenment and guidance. Plato stresses a
- |2
                      pattern frequently repeated in the history of this idea. While it is
- |2
                      reasonable to conclude that it was the moral fervor of Socrates seeking
- |2
                      definitions of ethical con- cepts which led
- |2
                      Plato to the notions of permanent, unchanging standards, the intellectual
- |2
                      puzzles of Parmenides and Zeno influenced the later development of
- |2
                      Plato's doctrine. Ideas of Sameness, Difference, and Existence found their
- |2
                      elaboration in the later doctrine of Forms, always as a way of explaining
- |2
                      and accounting for the appearance of development and change in our
- |2
                      sensory experiences. Moral dilemmas in the earlier dialogues gave way in
- |2
                      the later ones (Parmenides, Sophist, Statesman) to
- |2
                      logical puzzles and challenges.
- |2
                  Conceiving of the reality of abstractions like Same-
- |2
                          ness and Difference, the Large and the Small, Justice and
- |2
                      Beauty, is difficult if we use the familiar world of perception as our
- |2
                      touchstone for reality. What Plato's notion of degrees of reality can do
- |2
                      for us is to lead the way to viewing the world as composed of a wide
- |2
                      variety of things. We need not go all the way with the Great Chain of
- |2
                      Being, from lowest and earliest095
- |2
                       cells to Angels and God, but it is important for a proper
- |2
                      understanding of our many-faceted world to have a way of fitting everything
- |2
                      into a coherent view of real- ity. The concept
- |2
                      of degrees or kinds of reality enables us to do just that, to see that
- |2
                      anything experienced or mentioned, observable or conceivable belongs to
- |2
                      the world in some way. We may want to make some distinctions, to place
- |2
                      some items in our scheme of things in more prominent, more basic places, to
- |2
                      order and relate the ingredients of our world in particular ways. What
- |2
                      we cannot do is to label some items “ap-
- |2
                          pearance,” if we intend thereby to exclude them from
- |2
                      the real. This is not to say that the pressures leading philosophers to
- |2
                      contrast appearance with reality are any the less forceful and demanding.
- |2
                      It is only to say that, however we view the contrast between sensing
- |2
                      and conceiving, between concrete particulars and ab-
- |2
                          stract concepts, we have to recognize that that contrast is
- |2
                      itself made within reality.
- |2
                  The Platonic doctrine of degrees of reality lends itself to religion in two
- |2
                      different ways. In the hands of Plotinus it leads to a mystical metaphysic
- |2
                      with a divine One as the culmination of the scale of being. All else
- |2
                      is conceived as emanations from this One. Spinoza gave voice later to a
- |2
                      similar metaphysic of totality—as Parmenides did
- |2
                      before—but with more intellectual and less mystical content,
- |2
                      though Spinoza's goal was also moral and religious. The doctrine of
- |2
                      degrees of reality also lends itself to the intellectual attempts to
- |2
                      articulate and justify a belief in God. Both Saint Anselm and Descartes
- |2
                      made use of this notion in their proofs for God's existence. This use of
- |2
                      the notion is, however, not central to the idea of appear- ance and reality. What is central and characteristic
- |2
                      of much seventeenth-century philosophical use of this idea is
- |2
                      Descartes' insistence that physical reality can be understood, not sensed or imagined. What the un- derstanding reveals is a world of geometrical proper- ties, extension being the essential
- |2
                      category. The famous wax example in his Meditations
- |2
                      (Part I) echoes the Greek rejection of the sense-world as real; his
- |2
                      proof for body concludes that there is body but that it may not be as
- |2
                      it seems to our senses.
- |2
                  A strong motive behind the metaphysic of Descartes was the concern to find a
- |2
                      conceptual basis for the formulation and understanding of science; he
- |2
                      sought to provide the categories and the method for seeing the world
- |2
                      in scientific terms. The category of extension, like its corresponding
- |2
                      category of thought, was a non- sensory
- |2
                      concept. Descartes did not think of sense expe-
- |2
                          rience as less real (though he exploited its possibilities for
- |2
                      deception), but he insisted that sensation will not yield a knowledge of
- |2
                      matter or mind. Importance is clearly given to the nonsensory. The basic principles
- |2
                       of science were to be found in the basic simples (the simple
- |2
                      natures) of his metaphysic.
- |2
                  The seventeenth-century philosophers were particu-
- |2
                          larly concerned with science. Leibniz is equally repre- sentative with Descartes. The
- |2
                      concept of monads— immaterial atoms, each very much like
- |2
                      Parmenides' One—was Leibniz' metaphysical way of capturing
- |2
                      some of the principles he thought science needed to explain and formulate
- |2
                      the nature of body and motion. Activity for him was a basic scientific and
- |2
                      metaphysical category. Leibniz' program is especially important in the
- |2
                      history of this idea of appearance and reality be-
- |2
                          cause of the way in which the philosophical expression of that
- |2
                      idea in his metaphysical writings was antici-
- |2
                      pated by his own attempts to deal mathematically and intellectually
- |2
                      with the science of motion. The threefold appeal of this idea in the
- |2
                      history of thought—the reli- gious,
- |2
                      the scientific, and the metaphysical—is at work in Leibniz. He
- |2
                      liked to say that the experienced phe- nomena
- |2
                      (the appearances) were well-founded: just the sort of phenomena we would
- |2
                      expect if the world was really composed of the immaterial atoms he said it
- |2
                      was. At the metaphysical level, we find in Leibniz a whole series of
- |2
                      translations from ordinary language and expe-
- |2
                      rience to the language and reality of monads. The world conceived as
- |2
                      colonies of different kinds of monads has God as a sort of super-monad.
- |2
                          Immate- riality and self-contained
- |2
                      actions are the basic features of the world at the real (i.e., monadic)
- |2
                      level.
- |2
                  Conceptualization of monads is not easy. Acceptance of tiny imperceptible
- |2
                      material monads or atoms has always proved far easier. The Corpuscular
- |2
                      Hypothesis used by seventeenth-century scientists in England, adopted
- |2
                      by Locke in his philosophy, does not make any unnecessary demands on our
- |2
                      thought, since it thinks of those corpuscular entities on analogy with
- |2
                      gross bodies. Whenever philosophers move into a metaphysic of appearance
- |2
                      and reality, where some of the items ascribed to reality put a strain on
- |2
                      our easy conceptualization rooted in the perceptual world, spe- cial problems arise about explaining what the
- |2
                      real status of those items is. In almost all cases, such tran- scendent items can be seen to work well
- |2
                      as explanatory concepts. The difficulties appear
- |2
                      when those items are given an ontological status as well. Leibniz seems
- |2
                      to have recognized something of these difficulties in hisDiscourse on Metaphysics (1686) where, at one point,
- |2
                      he suggests that talk of monads may only be a manner of speaking. To
- |2
                      conceive of almost any transcendent abstraction as having ontological
- |2
                      status, without deifying it, is indeed troublesome.
- |2
                  One interesting way around some of these problems is found in Spinoza's use
- |2
                      of the distinction of appear- ance and
- |2
                      reality. What Spinoza did was to eliminate096
- |2
                       from his metaphysic all transcendent items, including the
- |2
                      traditional God of the Judeo-Christian tradition. Instead, the totality of
- |2
                      that which is is itself deified. Traditional divine attributes are still
- |2
                      ascribed to this totality, but Spinoza is very explicit in warning us
- |2
                      not to be misled by these ascriptions. God or Substance is infinite,
- |2
                      possessed of infinite attributes, cause of all and cause of itself, but is
- |2
                      not different from all that is. What Spinoza's use of this idea requires is
- |2
                      a shift in our understanding, not an acceptance of any new or strange
- |2
                      metaphysical entities. Everything in the world, the most common and
- |2
                      ordinary as well, can be viewed and understood in two different ways.
- |2
                      From the point of view of appearance and ordinary percep- tion, this glass of water, this table, this book is
- |2
                      finite, in time, caused, subject to change, and possessed of the
- |2
                      sensory properties we sense it as having. But these same objects can be
- |2
                      placed in a different perspective where their particularity does not
- |2
                      disappear, but where it is viewed from the perspective of the totality
- |2
                      and that particularity can be seen as modifications of the totality.
- |2
                      Viewing the world (better, the totality of everything) as a whole, as a
- |2
                      unit, very general categor- ies can be used
- |2
                      to encompass everything. Of all that there is that we know (and Spinoza
- |2
                      accepted the limi- tation of human
- |2
                      knowledge), it is either extended or immaterial (i.e., thought). These
- |2
                      categories are
- |2
                      proper- ties of the whole, but only insofar
- |2
                      as there are particu- lar extended and
- |2
                      thinking things. Viewing particular objects in this way takes us outside
- |2
                      time and causation, because time and causation are features of
- |2
                      particular objects only. The totality is timeless and uncaused.
- |2
                  Parmenides is obviously reincarnated but trans-
- |2
                          formed in this Spinozistic conception. The problem of conceiving
- |2
                      of transcendent entities has disappeared, to be replaced by what may be a
- |2
                      difference in kind of predication. That is, when Spinoza says God or Sub- stance is cause of itself, is
- |2
                      “cause” being used in the same way, with the same
- |2
                      meaning, as in more ordinary causal judgments? Clearly not, in part because
- |2
                          causa sui really means
- |2
                      “uncaused,” in part because the ascription of
- |2
                      extension or thought to the totality which is Spinoza's Substance is a
- |2
                      tacit way of ascribing these predicates to particular objects. Only
- |2
                      particular mem- bers of the totality change and
- |2
                      are caused, occupy space and time. But because these individuals taken
- |2
                      together constitute the totality, the totality—not as a
- |2
                      collection but as a whole—also has these
- |2
                      properties, but not in the sense that it occupies space and time,
- |2
                      changes, and is caused.
- |2
                  One cannot be sure to what extent the borrowed meanings of his concepts from
- |2
                      traditional religious doctrine gave a religious flavor to Spinoza's demytho
- |2
                      logized metaphysic of Substance. Spinoza was an in- tense, meditative man; his attitude towards life was
- |2
                      moralist and humane rather than coolly intellectual. The concepts of his
- |2
                      metaphysic were not fashioned to deal with logical puzzles; they were to
- |2
                      deliver him and mankind from human bondage: “from his
- |2
                      intellect / And from the stillness of abstracted thought / He asked
- |2
                      repose” (Wordsworth, “The Wanderer,” lines
- |2
                      313-15). Intellectual understanding is in the service of enlightenment and
- |2
                      well-being. The Ethics of Spinoza offers us a way of
- |2
                      life, not one that requires us to forsake practice and action but one which
- |2
                      adds under- standing and peace of mind to
- |2
                      our daily lives. But of course, such a way to happiness and well-being is
- |2
                      not practicable or even feasible for many. The mental and emotional
- |2
                      state of mind requisite for finding, in this abstract concretizing of
- |2
                      appearance and reality, the peace (one could almost say beatitude) that
- |2
                      does not pass but comes through understanding is rare in man- kind.
- |2
                  While the naturalization of deity, characteristic of seventeenth-century
- |2
                      deists, easily lends itself to the kind of romantic religious attitude
- |2
                      toward nature found in Wordsworth, it would be difficult to think of
- |2
                      Spinoza's deification of nature finding a direct appli- cation in literature. One might expect to find
- |2
                      something like it in the metaphysical poets, but their conceits were
- |2
                      abstract and often contorted though not meta-
- |2
                          physical. For artists usually, for Wordsworth in partic- ular, experience of nature, not
- |2
                      abstracted thought, provides the mark of reality. Sometimes the artist
- |2
                      is content to record the appearance of things, the sensu- ous content is valuable enough. At other times, as
- |2
                      in Wordsworth's case, familiar perceptual objects are seen as having
- |2
                      an “inward meaning,” they reveal “the one
- |2
                      Presence, and the Life / Of the great whole” (The Prelude, II, lines 129-31). Unlike the academic studies
- |2
                      at Cambridge, which seemed to the poet of The
- |2
                      Prelude to take him away from the “sentiment of
- |2
                      Being,” experience of nature—the woods, mountains,
- |2
                      lakes of Windermere—enables him to converse “With
- |2
                      things that really are” (II, lines 412-13). The boundaries
- |2
                      of our perceptual world, the “cabinet of our
- |2
                      sensations,” can be transcended if we respond to “the
- |2
                      latent quali- ties / And essences of
- |2
                      things” (II, lines 223-29, 344-45). “To thee,
- |2
                      unblinded by these outward shows, / The unity of all has been
- |2
                      reveal'd” (II, lines 225-26).
- |2
                  There is Platonism, of course, in Wordsworth. The eternal Beauty of the
- |2
                      Forms reappears, with the famous “Ode—Intimations of
- |2
                      Immortality” typifying this fea- ture
- |2
                      of his thought. But the important characteristic of Wordsworth's poetry for
- |2
                      the history of the idea of appearance and reality is the deistic, natural religion097
- |2
                       of his longer poems. The intellectual tradition upon which
- |2
                      Wordsworth drew in his nature poetry is the same one to which deists and
- |2
                      Spinoza belonged. No sharp contrast between appearance and reality is
- |2
                      drawn, the totality of appearances and phenomena is
- |2
                      reality, but the perceptive person will come to view those objects in a way
- |2
                      which reveals the meanings latent in them. Deists, Wordsworth, and Spinoza,
- |2
                      in their respective ways worked within a unified, non- transcendent notion of reality but
- |2
                      drew distinctions of value within the one Being. All three did so for inspi- rational purposes. Appearances are
- |2
                      not rejected or denied a place in reality, they become reality when
- |2
                      experienced and understood in the proper way.
- |2
                  William Blake is another interesting though obscure example of a literary
- |2
                      application of metaphysical con- cepts. The
- |2
                      interpretation of Blake is difficult. Platonism and Berkeleyan idealism at
- |2
                      least seem to have com- bined to influence his
- |2
                      literary and aesthetic convictions. Northrop Frye (Fearful Symmetry...) cites those passages where Blake clearly
- |2
                      echoes Berkeley, e.g., “nothing is real beyond the imaginative
- |2
                      patterns men make of reality” (p. 19). Wordsworth's deism is
- |2
                          mis- leading for Blake, since it credits
- |2
                      to nature the realities of the imagination. The Platonism of Blake,
- |2
                      which G. M. Harper stresses in his study, The
- |2
                          Neoplatonism of William Blake, finds expression in such passages
- |2
                      as “Imagination, the real and eternal World of which this
- |2
                      Vegetable Universe is but a faint shadow”
- |2
                      (“Jerusalem,” in Blake, The
- |2
                          Complete Writings, ed. G. Keynes [1957], p. 717), and
- |2
                      “There Exist in that Eternal World the Permanent Realities of
- |2
                      Every Thing which we see reflected in this Vegetable Glass of
- |2
                      Nature” (“A Vision of the Last Judgment,”
- |2
                      ibid., pp. 605-06). Harper cites several passages which seem to show Blake
- |2
                      giving independent existence to the Forms discovered (or created) by
- |2
                      the imagination. For example, “Whatever can be Created can be
- |2
                      Annihilated: Forms cannot: / The Oak is cut down by the Ax, the Lamb falls
- |2
                      by the Knife, / But their Forms Eternal Exist For-ever”
- |2
                      (“Milton,” ibid., p. 522). While Blake also seems to
- |2
                      retain something of the doctrine of “degrees or kinds of
- |2
                      reality,” e.g., in speaking of the worlds of vision, sight, and
- |2
                      memory, Frye insists that “These are not three different
- |2
                      worlds”; they are rather three different ways of looking at the
- |2
                      one world (p. 26).
- |2
                  Whether we view Blake through the metaphysics of Berkeley or of Plato is not
- |2
                      all that important, though both ingredients seem to be there. What is
- |2
                      important to see—and Blake is an ideal case—is the
- |2
                      way in which metaphysical concepts are used but transmuted by the
- |2
                      literary mind. Blake was more interested in artistic and aesthetic
- |2
                      adaptations of Plato and Berkeley than in
- |2
                       their doctrines themselves. The concept of form as a
- |2
                      metaphysical entity is replaced by that of archetype. The artist generally
- |2
                      is one who, via vision working on particulars, captures universal and
- |2
                      archetypal forms. Metaphysical idealism supplies the artist with an intel- lectual justification of the truths he
- |2
                      learns from his own experience about the creative imagination and the
- |2
                      activity of the mind. Platonism enables him to give more than a passing
- |2
                      reality to the forms of the imagi- nation.
- |2
                      The Platonic real world becomes the world of the imagination.
- |2
                  Kant's philosophy provided many of the Romantics, especially Coleridge, with
- |2
                      an even stronger and more attractive philosophical understanding for their
- |2
                      artistic activities. Schiller's aesthetic interpretations of Kant
- |2
                      probably had a strong influence upon the conceptuali- zations of the romantic imagination. Kant provided
- |2
                      a different kind of merging of phenomenal and real from that of
- |2
                      Spinoza. Working with the same totality of things, Kant gave to the mind
- |2
                      the fundamental forma- tive and shaping powers
- |2
                      of the world of experience. The real world just is
- |2
                      the world we experience, but its structure and order are not contingent and
- |2
                      external to mind, for they are necessary products of mental activity.
- |2
                      Kant's moral philosophy might seem to retain a separation between
- |2
                      phenomenal (appearance) and real, with its appeal to an intelligible world
- |2
                      as a way of explaining how human action can break out of the causal
- |2
                      uniformities of nature, but the conceptual grounding of the Metaphysical Foundations of Morals (1797) should
- |2
                      more properly be seen as a recognition of the difference in the causality
- |2
                      of events and actions. The causality of agency in action (and by
- |2
                      extension, of creative imagination) was an important philo- sophical prop for artists, especially
- |2
                      poets, of the eighteenth century, in freeing them from what was
- |2
                      believed (albeit falsely) to be Locke's failure to recog- nize the activity of mind in his influential account
- |2
                      of the human understanding.
- |2
                  Interestingly, the philosophical recognition of men-
- |2
                      tal activity, even to the extent of giving to mind form- ative and determining functions of reality, emerged
- |2
                      out of a metaphysic which rejected the sharp separation of appearance
- |2
                      and reality. Where artists interpret their goal as capturing reality,
- |2
                      dualisms which place reality in a realm separate from direct experience of
- |2
                          phenom- ena place a barrier in front of
- |2
                      artistic activity. Platonic visionaries could claim access into the realm
- |2
                      of Forms (experience of beauty was one path to the Forms rec- ognized by Plato), Wordsworthian and
- |2
                      Spinozistic deists and pantheists could claim the ability to capture
- |2
                      the living forms in nature. But still more attractive is the notion that
- |2
                      the creative imagination takes its place098
- |2
                       alongside the other mental apparatus elaborated by Kant and
- |2
                      plays a formative role in determining the real. Since Kant, most literary
- |2
                      and artistic support in philosophy has come from the Kantian and
- |2
                      Hegelian merging of appearance and reality.
- |2
                  Hegel gave the most grandiose construction to this new metaphysics. The Phenomenology of Mind (1807) is a rich and, in its
- |2
                      own way, artistic work. The philo-
- |2
                      sophical tradition is that of Spinoza, deists, and pan- theists, with many a debt to Kant. No sharp breaks in
- |2
                      the scale of being, smooth transitions from one level or kind to the next,
- |2
                      until in Absolute Spirit we have Hegel's attempt to formulate in abstract
- |2
                      and semireli- gious concepts the unified
- |2
                      totality of all the levels and kinds of reality and appearance. Unlike the
- |2
                      aesthetic approach of Wordsworth, which revealed the most abstract
- |2
                      truth of reality by sensory exposure, Hegel's conceptual genius enables us
- |2
                      to apply the concepts of his metaphysic to sensory, social, political, and
- |2
                      religious experiences. We find in Hegel an application of meta- physical concepts to illuminate life,
- |2
                      not just art. The social tensions of master and slave, of ruler and
- |2
                      ruled, the intellectual tensions of experience and under- standing, of change and law are
- |2
                      viewed through the dialectic and structure of his metaphysic.
- |2
                  The Hegelian influence was massive, even within the English-speaking world.
- |2
                      It also was largely responsible for the decline and rejection of
- |2
                      metaphysics in twentieth-century English philosophy: those who were
- |2
                      opposed to metaphysics took Hegel as their example, even though few of the
- |2
                      positivists and scientific empir- icists had
- |2
                      any intimate understanding of Hegel. Never-
- |2
                          theless, even within these new forms of empiricism, with their
- |2
                      reliance upon logic and science, dualisms of appearance and reality emerged
- |2
                      again. Philosophers saw science as the authority on the nature of the
- |2
                      world; but, since the scientific account talked of unobservable
- |2
                      particles, the world of ordinary human experience had to be given some
- |2
                      place in reality. The sense-datum theories of Bertrand Russell, G. E.
- |2
                      Moore, C. D. Broad, and H. H. Price tried to relate appearances to
- |2
                      reality as effect to cause. Human knowledge was immediately and mainly
- |2
                      of sense qualities, indirectly and inferen-
- |2
                          tially of the scientifically designated causes. Knowledge by
- |2
                      acquaintance and knowledge by description (a dis-
- |2
                          tinction first made by William James in Principles
- |2
                          of Psychology, New York [1890], I, 221) was Russell's way of
- |2
                      formulating the epistemic access we have to ap-
- |2
                          pearances and reality. The transitions and develop- ments of dualism and phenomenalism of previous cen- turies now reappeared (almost as Hegel's
- |2
                      dialectic predicted) in the new but transformed garbs of New Realism,
- |2
                      Critical Realism, and Common Sense Direct Realism. These have been almost
- |2
                      exclusively English
- |2
                       and American formulations, debates still not com- pleted. (See R. J. Hirst's The Problems
- |2
                          of Perception for a good summary and discussion of many of
- |2
                      these issues.)
- |2
                  Continental metaphysical concerns during the twentieth century have stayed
- |2
                      strictly within the Kantian and Hegelian tradition. Edmund Husserl's
- |2
                      phenomenology became the dominant mode. Two fea-
- |2
                      tures characterize Husserl's philosophy: a method of analysis and a
- |2
                      new ontology of meaning. The meta- physical
- |2
                      dictum here is “the world is my world,” the world of
- |2
                      lived, human experience. The whole realm of experience becomes a field for
- |2
                      analysis, everything now becomes phenomena. Perhaps more stress has
- |2
                      been placed by Husserl's followers upon the method of
- |2
                      analysis—supposedly unbiased and free from all ontological
- |2
                      prejudices—than upon the ontology. Ques-
- |2
                          tions of reality are supposed to be set aside as useless,
- |2
                      attention is then free to look to the descriptions of all and any
- |2
                      phenomena. But there is a metaphysic here all the same, a metaphysic of
- |2
                      experience which is clearly Kantian and Hegelian. Since the stress is
- |2
                      upon experience as lived and interpreted by men, meaning becomes the
- |2
                      central concept, meaning for me. The union of reality in and for itself
- |2
                          (en-soi et pour-soi), upon which the
- |2
                      phenomenological metaphysic of ex- perience
- |2
                      rests, has been reformulated by Sartre inBeing and Nothingness (L'Etre et le
- |2
                          néant, 1943). That union is possible only because
- |2
                      man is the center of this world.
- |2
                  Sartre and other existentialist writers, in their liter- ary productions, seized upon the emotions of man as
- |2
                      the most significant definers of reality: anguish, dread, loneliness. The
- |2
                      reality of a life can be experienced best, they believe, in confrontations
- |2
                      with death, fear, and dread—a far cry from the tranquility and
- |2
                      peace of Wordsworth's real world. Husserl's phenomenology has had
- |2
                      widespread impact upon literature, psychology, psychoanalysis, religion,
- |2
                      and philosophy, even upon social science and education. Moreover, that
- |2
                      impact has finally been felt in the English-speaking world. But the
- |2
                      existentialist writers—and the art of the absurd in
- |2
                      general—have narrowed the scope of reality so much that some of
- |2
                      them are close to denying all reality. “Authentic”
- |2
                      experience is privileged and rare, perhaps impossible; reality as meaning
- |2
                      for a person may be slipping from our grasp: such seems to be the
- |2
                      message of much of existentialist writing. They are close to
- |2
                      presenting us with the negation of the romantic striving for and belief in
- |2
                      a new and better reality in or behind appearances. Samuel Beckett's
- |2
                      noncharacters find no meaning and very little reality in their experience.
- |2
                      It makes little difference whether Godot is given a reli- gious interpretation, or whether it is secularized and099
- |2
                       taken to signify a meaning for the world. Beckett's early
- |2
                      characters are waiting for meaning to appear out of the routine
- |2
                      concatenation of ordinary events. His later characters have given up
- |2
                      entirely on Godot, and merely live out their meaningless experiences in
- |2
                      absurd and unreal environments. Autonomy, creativity, and value have
- |2
                      been replaced by one-dimensional man living out his time in a controlled
- |2
                      but meaningless world. Parmenides' denial to appearances of any status
- |2
                      in reality has found its contemporary formulation within a metaphysic which
- |2
                      identifies reality with ap- pearances. The
- |2
                      total annihilation threatened by the bomb has found its literary and
- |2
                      philosophic counterpart in this denial of reality to the only reality left,
- |2
                      the reality of lived human experience.
- |2
                  It is difficult to predict the future of this idea of appearance and
- |2
                      reality. Its apotheosis in metaphysics and literature has had a parallel in
- |2
                      religion and theol- ogy: the transcendence of
- |2
                      God has struggled with the meaningful immanence of human life. In many
- |2
                      modern theologies, religious meaning seems to have followed the
- |2
                      direction of existentialist writers, being located in personal attitudes
- |2
                      towards man and the world. The metaphysic of transcendent entities thus
- |2
                      seems on all fronts to have given way to the phenomenological
- |2
                      categories: reality is as it is interpreted as being in human experience.
- |2
                      What there is has become a func- tion of what
- |2
                      man finds meaningful and valuable in his experience. Parmenides denied
- |2
                      reality to appearances. Our contemporaries are close to denying reality
- |2
                      to reality. Such an ultimate denial would be the complete reversal of
- |2
                      the appearance-reality distinction.

               Dictionary of the History of IdeasThe general sense of the contrast between
- |2
                      appearance and reality would be any difference between what is the
- |2
                      case and what appears to be so. Thus, the ordinary appearance of a person
- |2
                      frequently conceals his real feelings and thoughts, the appearance of a
- |2
                      village may be one of tranquility, but the reality one of turmoil,
- |2
                      hatred, etc. The more specific sense of this contrast arose out of
- |2
                      philosophical concerns about the nature of the world. The concept of
- |2
                      “world” and of “reality” in
- |2
                      this philosophical concern is related to but different from the ordinary
- |2
                      concept. Early Greek cosmologists interpreted the perceived world in terms
- |2
                      of causal and intentional forces of the gods. Pre-Socratic philoso- phers, searching for secular
- |2
                      explanations, came to draw a sharp contrast between the perceived world and
- |2
                      the ultimate “real stuff.” Water, air, atoms,
- |2
                      abstract notions like “unlimited” or
- |2
                      “boundless,” and “mind” were
- |2
                      offered as the stuff of which the world is really made or in terms of which
- |2
                      understanding of the world must be made. Greek atomism is a prime example.
- |2
                      All observed properties and qualities of objects were explained in
- |2
                      terms of the shape and motion of insensi- ble
- |2
                      material particles. This account of reality was not only important in
- |2
                      itself, it was, at least to Lucretius later, of ethical and emotional value
- |2
                      in leading man via understanding to happiness (cf. Spinoza).The atomistic way of thinking of the cause and ground of the perceived world
- |2
                      is easiest for us to accept since it fits in well with the early forms of
- |2
                      atomism in modern physics. As recent science has moved to more and
- |2
                      more abstractions, e.g., energy, force, fields, etc., the analogy of real
- |2
                      world to the perceived world has given way. Those abstract concepts in
- |2
                      Greek thought—the boundless, Parmenides' One, Plato's
- |2
                      Forms—likewise required a different mode of thought for their
- |2
                      understanding. Even though Parmenides may have thought of the One as in
- |2
                      some way physical, the geometrical concepts easily emerged from his concep- tualization of the One. The
- |2
                      contrast between what appears to be the case and what is in fact so is
- |2
                      sharp and striking. Parmenides' recommendation, again as much for
- |2
                      moral as for intellectual reasons, was to turn our backs on the way of
- |2
                      appearance and to contem- plate the way of
- |2
                      truth and reality. The contrast was so complete that sense experience was
- |2
                      contradictory to reality: what the senses report cannot be true since
- |2
                      motion is unreal. The paradoxes of Zeno simply played upon this Parmenidean
- |2
                      contrast of appearance and reality. The senses are denied, are unreal.This striking Parmenidean contrast set many prob-
- |2
                      lems for Plato and subsequent philosophers. The chal- lenge of the paradoxes had to be met, one cannot carry

                       out Parmenides' radical denial of all that our senses report.
- |2
                      The most fundamental difficulty in a concept of reality such as Parmenides
- |2
                      advanced is the implied if not explicit denial to the perceived world of
- |2
                          any status in reality. Bradley was much later to
- |2
                      point out that, no matter how different our philosophy may make
- |2
                      appearances from reality, there is an important sense in which the
- |2
                      appearances must occupy some place in reality. The Bradleyan concept of
- |2
                      reality owes much to Hegel, where radical contrasts and differences
- |2
                      tend to disappear in a dialectical flow: reality becomes the totality
- |2
                      of that which is, Spinoza's facies totius
- |2
                      Universi (“the whole aspect of the
- |2
                      universe”). But quite apart from such an Hegelian transformation
- |2
                      of the concept of reality, there is an important truth in the
- |2
                      insistence that anything, appearances as well as nonappearances,are in some sense. At least the status is that they exist as appearances. Plato put the point
- |2
                      trenchantly in having Socrates ask (Republic V,
- |2
                      476D), “When you know something, do you know something that is
- |2
                      or something that is not?” The conclusion from this ques- tion has to be (as both Plato and
- |2
                      Parmenides agreed) that that which is not can neither be nor be conceived.To make room for sense perception which reveals a world of change and
- |2
                      motion, of diversity and differ- ence, Plato
- |2
                      elaborated a conception of different degrees and kinds of realness. The
- |2
                      most real—his Forms—fulfill the role of reality in
- |2
                      the more simple notions of appearance and reality: the Forms play
- |2
                      causal, semantic, and moral roles. The intellectual understanding of the
- |2
                      Forms has an alternate, aesthetic mode. Both modes are sought for social,
- |2
                      political, and ethical enlightenment and guidance. Plato stresses a
- |2
                      pattern frequently repeated in the history of this idea. While it is
- |2
                      reasonable to conclude that it was the moral fervor of Socrates seeking
- |2
                      definitions of ethical con- cepts which led
- |2
                      Plato to the notions of permanent, unchanging standards, the intellectual
- |2
                      puzzles of Parmenides and Zeno influenced the later development of
- |2
                      Plato's doctrine. Ideas of Sameness, Difference, and Existence found their
- |2
                      elaboration in the later doctrine of Forms, always as a way of explaining
- |2
                      and accounting for the appearance of development and change in our
- |2
                      sensory experiences. Moral dilemmas in the earlier dialogues gave way in
- |2
                      the later ones (Parmenides, Sophist, Statesman) to
- |2
                      logical puzzles and challenges.Conceiving of the reality of abstractions like Same-
- |2
                          ness and Difference, the Large and the Small, Justice and
- |2
                      Beauty, is difficult if we use the familiar world of perception as our
- |2
                      touchstone for reality. What Plato's notion of degrees of reality can do
- |2
                      for us is to lead the way to viewing the world as composed of a wide
- |2
                      variety of things. We need not go all the way with the Great Chain of
- |2
                      Being, from lowest and earliestThe Platonic doctrine of degrees of reality lends itself to religion in two
- |2
                      different ways. In the hands of Plotinus it leads to a mystical metaphysic
- |2
                      with a divine One as the culmination of the scale of being. All else
- |2
                      is conceived as emanations from this One. Spinoza gave voice later to a
- |2
                      similar metaphysic of totality—as Parmenides did
- |2
                      before—but with more intellectual and less mystical content,
- |2
                      though Spinoza's goal was also moral and religious. The doctrine of
- |2
                      degrees of reality also lends itself to the intellectual attempts to
- |2
                      articulate and justify a belief in God. Both Saint Anselm and Descartes
- |2
                      made use of this notion in their proofs for God's existence. This use of
- |2
                      the notion is, however, not central to the idea of appear- ance and reality. What is central and characteristic
- |2
                      of much seventeenth-century philosophical use of this idea is
- |2
                      Descartes' insistence that physical reality can be understood, not sensed or imagined. What the un- derstanding reveals is a world of geometrical proper- ties, extension being the essential
- |2
                      category. The famous wax example in his Meditations
- |2
                      (Part I) echoes the Greek rejection of the sense-world as real; his
- |2
                      proof for body concludes that there is body but that it may not be as
- |2
                      it seems to our senses.A strong motive behind the metaphysic of Descartes was the concern to find a
- |2
                      conceptual basis for the formulation and understanding of science; he
- |2
                      sought to provide the categories and the method for seeing the world
- |2
                      in scientific terms. The category of extension, like its corresponding
- |2
                      category of thought, was a non- sensory
- |2
                      concept. Descartes did not think of sense expe-
- |2
                          rience as less real (though he exploited its possibilities for
- |2
                      deception), but he insisted that sensation will not yield a knowledge of
- |2
                      matter or mind. Importance is clearly given to the nonsensory. The basic principles
- |2
                       of science were to be found in the basic simples (the simple
- |2
                      natures) of his metaphysic.The seventeenth-century philosophers were particu-
- |2
                          larly concerned with science. Leibniz is equally repre- sentative with Descartes. The
- |2
                      concept of monads— immaterial atoms, each very much like
- |2
                      Parmenides' One—was Leibniz' metaphysical way of capturing
- |2
                      some of the principles he thought science needed to explain and formulate
- |2
                      the nature of body and motion. Activity for him was a basic scientific and
- |2
                      metaphysical category. Leibniz' program is especially important in the
- |2
                      history of this idea of appearance and reality be-
- |2
                          cause of the way in which the philosophical expression of that
- |2
                      idea in his metaphysical writings was antici-
- |2
                      pated by his own attempts to deal mathematically and intellectually
- |2
                      with the science of motion. The threefold appeal of this idea in the
- |2
                      history of thought—the reli- gious,
- |2
                      the scientific, and the metaphysical—is at work in Leibniz. He
- |2
                      liked to say that the experienced phe- nomena
- |2
                      (the appearances) were well-founded: just the sort of phenomena we would
- |2
                      expect if the world was really composed of the immaterial atoms he said it
- |2
                      was. At the metaphysical level, we find in Leibniz a whole series of
- |2
                      translations from ordinary language and expe-
- |2
                      rience to the language and reality of monads. The world conceived as
- |2
                      colonies of different kinds of monads has God as a sort of super-monad.
- |2
                          Immate- riality and self-contained
- |2
                      actions are the basic features of the world at the real (i.e., monadic)
- |2
                      level.Conceptualization of monads is not easy. Acceptance of tiny imperceptible
- |2
                      material monads or atoms has always proved far easier. The Corpuscular
- |2
                      Hypothesis used by seventeenth-century scientists in England, adopted
- |2
                      by Locke in his philosophy, does not make any unnecessary demands on our
- |2
                      thought, since it thinks of those corpuscular entities on analogy with
- |2
                      gross bodies. Whenever philosophers move into a metaphysic of appearance
- |2
                      and reality, where some of the items ascribed to reality put a strain on
- |2
                      our easy conceptualization rooted in the perceptual world, spe- cial problems arise about explaining what the
- |2
                      real status of those items is. In almost all cases, such tran- scendent items can be seen to work well
- |2
                      as explanatory concepts. The difficulties appear
- |2
                      when those items are given an ontological status as well. Leibniz seems
- |2
                      to have recognized something of these difficulties in hisDiscourse on Metaphysics (1686) where, at one point,
- |2
                      he suggests that talk of monads may only be a manner of speaking. To
- |2
                      conceive of almost any transcendent abstraction as having ontological
- |2
                      status, without deifying it, is indeed troublesome.One interesting way around some of these problems is found in Spinoza's use
- |2
                      of the distinction of appear- ance and
- |2
                      reality. What Spinoza did was to eliminateParmenides is obviously reincarnated but trans-
- |2
                          formed in this Spinozistic conception. The problem of conceiving
- |2
                      of transcendent entities has disappeared, to be replaced by what may be a
- |2
                      difference in kind of predication. That is, when Spinoza says God or Sub- stance is cause of itself, is
- |2
                      “cause” being used in the same way, with the same
- |2
                      meaning, as in more ordinary causal judgments? Clearly not, in part because
- |2
                          causa sui really means
- |2
                      “uncaused,” in part because the ascription of
- |2
                      extension or thought to the totality which is Spinoza's Substance is a
- |2
                      tacit way of ascribing these predicates to particular objects. Only
- |2
                      particular mem- bers of the totality change and
- |2
                      are caused, occupy space and time. But because these individuals taken
- |2
                      together constitute the totality, the totality—not as a
- |2
                      collection but as a whole—also has these
- |2
                      properties, but not in the sense that it occupies space and time,
- |2
                      changes, and is caused.One cannot be sure to what extent the borrowed meanings of his concepts from
- |2
                      traditional religious doctrine gave a religious flavor to Spinoza's demytho
- |2
                      logized metaphysic of Substance. Spinoza was an in- tense, meditative man; his attitude towards life was
- |2
                      moralist and humane rather than coolly intellectual. The concepts of his
- |2
                      metaphysic were not fashioned to deal with logical puzzles; they were to
- |2
                      deliver him and mankind from human bondage: “from his
- |2
                      intellect / And from the stillness of abstracted thought / He asked
- |2
                      repose” (Wordsworth, “The Wanderer,” lines
- |2
                      313-15). Intellectual understanding is in the service of enlightenment and
- |2
                      well-being. The Ethics of Spinoza offers us a way of
- |2
                      life, not one that requires us to forsake practice and action but one which
- |2
                      adds under- standing and peace of mind to
- |2
                      our daily lives. But of course, such a way to happiness and well-being is
- |2
                      not practicable or even feasible for many. The mental and emotional
- |2
                      state of mind requisite for finding, in this abstract concretizing of
- |2
                      appearance and reality, the peace (one could almost say beatitude) that
- |2
                      does not pass but comes through understanding is rare in man- kind.While the naturalization of deity, characteristic of seventeenth-century
- |2
                      deists, easily lends itself to the kind of romantic religious attitude
- |2
                      toward nature found in Wordsworth, it would be difficult to think of
- |2
                      Spinoza's deification of nature finding a direct appli- cation in literature. One might expect to find
- |2
                      something like it in the metaphysical poets, but their conceits were
- |2
                      abstract and often contorted though not meta-
- |2
                          physical. For artists usually, for Wordsworth in partic- ular, experience of nature, not
- |2
                      abstracted thought, provides the mark of reality. Sometimes the artist
- |2
                      is content to record the appearance of things, the sensu- ous content is valuable enough. At other times, as
- |2
                      in Wordsworth's case, familiar perceptual objects are seen as having
- |2
                      an “inward meaning,” they reveal “the one
- |2
                      Presence, and the Life / Of the great whole” (The Prelude, II, lines 129-31). Unlike the academic studies
- |2
                      at Cambridge, which seemed to the poet of The
- |2
                      Prelude to take him away from the “sentiment of
- |2
                      Being,” experience of nature—the woods, mountains,
- |2
                      lakes of Windermere—enables him to converse “With
- |2
                      things that really are” (II, lines 412-13). The boundaries
- |2
                      of our perceptual world, the “cabinet of our
- |2
                      sensations,” can be transcended if we respond to “the
- |2
                      latent quali- ties / And essences of
- |2
                      things” (II, lines 223-29, 344-45). “To thee,
- |2
                      unblinded by these outward shows, / The unity of all has been
- |2
                      reveal'd” (II, lines 225-26).There is Platonism, of course, in Wordsworth. The eternal Beauty of the
- |2
                      Forms reappears, with the famous “Ode—Intimations of
- |2
                      Immortality” typifying this fea- ture
- |2
                      of his thought. But the important characteristic of Wordsworth's poetry for
- |2
                      the history of the idea of appearance and reality is the deistic, natural religionWilliam Blake is another interesting though obscure example of a literary
- |2
                      application of metaphysical con- cepts. The
- |2
                      interpretation of Blake is difficult. Platonism and Berkeleyan idealism at
- |2
                      least seem to have com- bined to influence his
- |2
                      literary and aesthetic convictions. Northrop Frye (Fearful Symmetry...) cites those passages where Blake clearly
- |2
                      echoes Berkeley, e.g., “nothing is real beyond the imaginative
- |2
                      patterns men make of reality” (p. 19). Wordsworth's deism is
- |2
                          mis- leading for Blake, since it credits
- |2
                      to nature the realities of the imagination. The Platonism of Blake,
- |2
                      which G. M. Harper stresses in his study, The
- |2
                          Neoplatonism of William Blake, finds expression in such passages
- |2
                      as “Imagination, the real and eternal World of which this
- |2
                      Vegetable Universe is but a faint shadow”
- |2
                      (“Jerusalem,” in Blake, The
- |2
                          Complete Writings, ed. G. Keynes [1957], p. 717), and
- |2
                      “There Exist in that Eternal World the Permanent Realities of
- |2
                      Every Thing which we see reflected in this Vegetable Glass of
- |2
                      Nature” (“A Vision of the Last Judgment,”
- |2
                      ibid., pp. 605-06). Harper cites several passages which seem to show Blake
- |2
                      giving independent existence to the Forms discovered (or created) by
- |2
                      the imagination. For example, “Whatever can be Created can be
- |2
                      Annihilated: Forms cannot: / The Oak is cut down by the Ax, the Lamb falls
- |2
                      by the Knife, / But their Forms Eternal Exist For-ever”
- |2
                      (“Milton,” ibid., p. 522). While Blake also seems to
- |2
                      retain something of the doctrine of “degrees or kinds of
- |2
                      reality,” e.g., in speaking of the worlds of vision, sight, and
- |2
                      memory, Frye insists that “These are not three different
- |2
                      worlds”; they are rather three different ways of looking at the
- |2
                      one world (p. 26).Whether we view Blake through the metaphysics of Berkeley or of Plato is not
- |2
                      all that important, though both ingredients seem to be there. What is
- |2
                      important to see—and Blake is an ideal case—is the
- |2
                      way in which metaphysical concepts are used but transmuted by the
- |2
                      literary mind. Blake was more interested in artistic and aesthetic
- |2
                      adaptations of Plato and Berkeley than in
- |2
                       their doctrines themselves. The concept of form as a
- |2
                      metaphysical entity is replaced by that of archetype. The artist generally
- |2
                      is one who, via vision working on particulars, captures universal and
- |2
                      archetypal forms. Metaphysical idealism supplies the artist with an intel- lectual justification of the truths he
- |2
                      learns from his own experience about the creative imagination and the
- |2
                      activity of the mind. Platonism enables him to give more than a passing
- |2
                      reality to the forms of the imagi- nation.
- |2
                      The Platonic real world becomes the world of the imagination.Kant's philosophy provided many of the Romantics, especially Coleridge, with
- |2
                      an even stronger and more attractive philosophical understanding for their
- |2
                      artistic activities. Schiller's aesthetic interpretations of Kant
- |2
                      probably had a strong influence upon the conceptuali- zations of the romantic imagination. Kant provided
- |2
                      a different kind of merging of phenomenal and real from that of
- |2
                      Spinoza. Working with the same totality of things, Kant gave to the mind
- |2
                      the fundamental forma- tive and shaping powers
- |2
                      of the world of experience. The real world just is
- |2
                      the world we experience, but its structure and order are not contingent and
- |2
                      external to mind, for they are necessary products of mental activity.
- |2
                      Kant's moral philosophy might seem to retain a separation between
- |2
                      phenomenal (appearance) and real, with its appeal to an intelligible world
- |2
                      as a way of explaining how human action can break out of the causal
- |2
                      uniformities of nature, but the conceptual grounding of the Metaphysical Foundations of Morals (1797) should
- |2
                      more properly be seen as a recognition of the difference in the causality
- |2
                      of events and actions. The causality of agency in action (and by
- |2
                      extension, of creative imagination) was an important philo- sophical prop for artists, especially
- |2
                      poets, of the eighteenth century, in freeing them from what was
- |2
                      believed (albeit falsely) to be Locke's failure to recog- nize the activity of mind in his influential account
- |2
                      of the human understanding.Interestingly, the philosophical recognition of men-
- |2
                      tal activity, even to the extent of giving to mind form- ative and determining functions of reality, emerged
- |2
                      out of a metaphysic which rejected the sharp separation of appearance
- |2
                      and reality. Where artists interpret their goal as capturing reality,
- |2
                      dualisms which place reality in a realm separate from direct experience of
- |2
                          phenom- ena place a barrier in front of
- |2
                      artistic activity. Platonic visionaries could claim access into the realm
- |2
                      of Forms (experience of beauty was one path to the Forms rec- ognized by Plato), Wordsworthian and
- |2
                      Spinozistic deists and pantheists could claim the ability to capture
- |2
                      the living forms in nature. But still more attractive is the notion that
- |2
                      the creative imagination takes its placeHegel gave the most grandiose construction to this new metaphysics. The Phenomenology of Mind (1807) is a rich and, in its
- |2
                      own way, artistic work. The philo-
- |2
                      sophical tradition is that of Spinoza, deists, and pan- theists, with many a debt to Kant. No sharp breaks in
- |2
                      the scale of being, smooth transitions from one level or kind to the next,
- |2
                      until in Absolute Spirit we have Hegel's attempt to formulate in abstract
- |2
                      and semireli- gious concepts the unified
- |2
                      totality of all the levels and kinds of reality and appearance. Unlike the
- |2
                      aesthetic approach of Wordsworth, which revealed the most abstract
- |2
                      truth of reality by sensory exposure, Hegel's conceptual genius enables us
- |2
                      to apply the concepts of his metaphysic to sensory, social, political, and
- |2
                      religious experiences. We find in Hegel an application of meta- physical concepts to illuminate life,
- |2
                      not just art. The social tensions of master and slave, of ruler and
- |2
                      ruled, the intellectual tensions of experience and under- standing, of change and law are
- |2
                      viewed through the dialectic and structure of his metaphysic.The Hegelian influence was massive, even within the English-speaking world.
- |2
                      It also was largely responsible for the decline and rejection of
- |2
                      metaphysics in twentieth-century English philosophy: those who were
- |2
                      opposed to metaphysics took Hegel as their example, even though few of the
- |2
                      positivists and scientific empir- icists had
- |2
                      any intimate understanding of Hegel. Never-
- |2
                          theless, even within these new forms of empiricism, with their
- |2
                      reliance upon logic and science, dualisms of appearance and reality emerged
- |2
                      again. Philosophers saw science as the authority on the nature of the
- |2
                      world; but, since the scientific account talked of unobservable
- |2
                      particles, the world of ordinary human experience had to be given some
- |2
                      place in reality. The sense-datum theories of Bertrand Russell, G. E.
- |2
                      Moore, C. D. Broad, and H. H. Price tried to relate appearances to
- |2
                      reality as effect to cause. Human knowledge was immediately and mainly
- |2
                      of sense qualities, indirectly and inferen-
- |2
                          tially of the scientifically designated causes. Knowledge by
- |2
                      acquaintance and knowledge by description (a dis-
- |2
                          tinction first made by William James in Principles
- |2
                          of Psychology, New York [1890], I, 221) was Russell's way of
- |2
                      formulating the epistemic access we have to ap-
- |2
                          pearances and reality. The transitions and develop- ments of dualism and phenomenalism of previous cen- turies now reappeared (almost as Hegel's
- |2
                      dialectic predicted) in the new but transformed garbs of New Realism,
- |2
                      Critical Realism, and Common Sense Direct Realism. These have been almost
- |2
                      exclusively English
- |2
                       and American formulations, debates still not com- pleted. (See R. J. Hirst's The Problems
- |2
                          of Perception for a good summary and discussion of many of
- |2
                      these issues.)Continental metaphysical concerns during the twentieth century have stayed
- |2
                      strictly within the Kantian and Hegelian tradition. Edmund Husserl's
- |2
                      phenomenology became the dominant mode. Two fea-
- |2
                      tures characterize Husserl's philosophy: a method of analysis and a
- |2
                      new ontology of meaning. The meta- physical
- |2
                      dictum here is “the world is my world,” the world of
- |2
                      lived, human experience. The whole realm of experience becomes a field for
- |2
                      analysis, everything now becomes phenomena. Perhaps more stress has
- |2
                      been placed by Husserl's followers upon the method of
- |2
                      analysis—supposedly unbiased and free from all ontological
- |2
                      prejudices—than upon the ontology. Ques-
- |2
                          tions of reality are supposed to be set aside as useless,
- |2
                      attention is then free to look to the descriptions of all and any
- |2
                      phenomena. But there is a metaphysic here all the same, a metaphysic of
- |2
                      experience which is clearly Kantian and Hegelian. Since the stress is
- |2
                      upon experience as lived and interpreted by men, meaning becomes the
- |2
                      central concept, meaning for me. The union of reality in and for itself
- |2
                          (en-soi et pour-soi), upon which the
- |2
                      phenomenological metaphysic of ex- perience
- |2
                      rests, has been reformulated by Sartre inBeing and Nothingness (L'Etre et le
- |2
                          néant, 1943). That union is possible only because
- |2
                      man is the center of this world.Sartre and other existentialist writers, in their liter- ary productions, seized upon the emotions of man as
- |2
                      the most significant definers of reality: anguish, dread, loneliness. The
- |2
                      reality of a life can be experienced best, they believe, in confrontations
- |2
                      with death, fear, and dread—a far cry from the tranquility and
- |2
                      peace of Wordsworth's real world. Husserl's phenomenology has had
- |2
                      widespread impact upon literature, psychology, psychoanalysis, religion,
- |2
                      and philosophy, even upon social science and education. Moreover, that
- |2
                      impact has finally been felt in the English-speaking world. But the
- |2
                      existentialist writers—and the art of the absurd in
- |2
                      general—have narrowed the scope of reality so much that some of
- |2
                      them are close to denying all reality. “Authentic”
- |2
                      experience is privileged and rare, perhaps impossible; reality as meaning
- |2
                      for a person may be slipping from our grasp: such seems to be the
- |2
                      message of much of existentialist writing. They are close to
- |2
                      presenting us with the negation of the romantic striving for and belief in
- |2
                      a new and better reality in or behind appearances. Samuel Beckett's
- |2
                      noncharacters find no meaning and very little reality in their experience.
- |2
                      It makes little difference whether Godot is given a reli- gious interpretation, or whether it is secularized andIt is difficult to predict the future of this idea of appearance and
- |2
                      reality. Its apotheosis in metaphysics and literature has had a parallel in
- |2
                      religion and theol- ogy: the transcendence of
- |2
                      God has struggled with the meaningful immanence of human life. In many
- |2
                      modern theologies, religious meaning seems to have followed the
- |2
                      direction of existentialist writers, being located in personal attitudes
- |2
                      towards man and the world. The metaphysic of transcendent entities thus
- |2
                      seems on all fronts to have given way to the phenomenological
- |2
                      categories: reality is as it is interpreted as being in human experience.
- |2
                      What there is has become a func- tion of what
- |2
                      man finds meaningful and valuable in his experience. Parmenides denied
- |2
                      reality to appearances. Our contemporaries are close to denying reality
- |2
                      to reality. Such an ultimate denial would be the complete reversal of
- |2
                      the appearance-reality distinction.F. H. Bradley, Appearance and Reality, A Metaphysical

  \               APPEARANCE AND REALITY\n                \n                The general
  sense of the contrast between\n                    appearance and reality would
  be any difference between what is the\n                    case and what appears
  to be so. Thus, the ordinary appearance of a person\n                    frequently
  conceals his real feelings and thoughts, the appearance of a\n                    village
  may be one of tranquility, but the reality one of turmoil,\n                    hatred,
  etc. The more specific sense of this contrast arose out of\n                    philosophical
  concerns about the nature of the world. The concept of\n                    “world”
  and of “reality” in\n                    this philosophical concern is related to
  but different from the ordinary\n                    concept. Early Greek cosmologists
  interpreted the perceived world in terms\n                    of causal and intentional
  forces of the gods. Pre-Socratic philoso- phers, searching for secular\n                    explanations,
  came to draw a sharp contrast between the perceived world and\n                    the
  ultimate “real stuff.” Water, air, atoms,\n                    abstract notions
  like “unlimited” or\n                    “boundless,” and “mind” were\n                    offered
  as the stuff of which the world is really made or in terms of which\n                    understanding
  of the world must be made. Greek atomism is a prime example.\n                    All
  observed properties and qualities of objects were explained in\n                    terms
  of the shape and motion of insensi- ble\n                    material particles.
  This account of reality was not only important in\n                    itself, it
  was, at least to Lucretius later, of ethical and emotional value\n                    in
  leading man via understanding to happiness (cf. Spinoza).\n                The atomistic
  way of thinking of the cause and ground of the perceived world\n                    is
  easiest for us to accept since it fits in well with the early forms of\n                    atomism
  in modern physics. As recent science has moved to more and\n                    more
  abstractions, e.g., energy, force, fields, etc., the analogy of real\n                    world
  to the perceived world has given way. Those abstract concepts in\n                    Greek
  thought—the boundless, Parmenides' One, Plato's\n                    Forms—likewise
  required a different mode of thought for their\n                    understanding.
  Even though Parmenides may have thought of the One as in\n                    some
  way physical, the geometrical concepts easily emerged from his concep- tualization
  of the One. The\n                    contrast between what appears to be the case
  and what is in fact so is\n                    sharp and striking. Parmenides' recommendation,
  again as much for\n                    moral as for intellectual reasons, was to
  turn our backs on the way of\n                    appearance and to contem- plate
  the way of\n                    truth and reality. The contrast was so complete
  that sense experience was\n                    contradictory to reality: what the
  senses report cannot be true since\n                    motion is unreal. The paradoxes
  of Zeno simply played upon this Parmenidean\n                    contrast of appearance
  and reality. The senses are denied, are unreal.\n                This striking Parmenidean
  contrast set many prob-\n                    lems for Plato and subsequent philosophers.
  The chal- lenge of the paradoxes had to be met, one cannot carry\n                     out
  Parmenides' radical denial of all that our senses report.\n                    The
  most fundamental difficulty in a concept of reality such as Parmenides\n                    advanced
  is the implied if not explicit denial to the perceived world of\n                        any
  status in reality. Bradley was much later to\n                    point out that,
  no matter how different our philosophy may make\n                    appearances
  from reality, there is an important sense in which the\n                    appearances
  must occupy some place in reality. The Bradleyan concept of\n                    reality
  owes much to Hegel, where radical contrasts and differences\n                    tend
  to disappear in a dialectical flow: reality becomes the totality\n                    of
  that which is, Spinoza's facies totius\n                    Universi (“the whole
  aspect of the\n                    universe”). But quite apart from such an Hegelian
  transformation\n                    of the concept of reality, there is an important
  truth in the\n                    insistence that anything, appearances as well
  as nonappearances,are in some sense. At least the status is that they exist as appearances.
  Plato put the point\n                    trenchantly in having Socrates ask (Republic
  V,\n                    476D), “When you know something, do you know something that
  is\n                    or something that is not?” The conclusion from this ques-
  tion has to be (as both Plato and\n                    Parmenides agreed) that that
  which is not can neither be nor be conceived.\n                To make room for
  sense perception which reveals a world of change and\n                    motion,
  of diversity and differ- ence, Plato\n                    elaborated a conception
  of different degrees and kinds of realness. The\n                    most real—his
  Forms—fulfill the role of reality in\n                    the more simple notions
  of appearance and reality: the Forms play\n                    causal, semantic,
  and moral roles. The intellectual understanding of the\n                    Forms
  has an alternate, aesthetic mode. Both modes are sought for social,\n                    political,
  and ethical enlightenment and guidance. Plato stresses a\n                    pattern
  frequently repeated in the history of this idea. While it is\n                    reasonable
  to conclude that it was the moral fervor of Socrates seeking\n                    definitions
  of ethical con- cepts which led\n                    Plato to the notions of permanent,
  unchanging standards, the intellectual\n                    puzzles of Parmenides
  and Zeno influenced the later development of\n                    Plato's doctrine.
  Ideas of Sameness, Difference, and Existence found their\n                    elaboration
  in the later doctrine of Forms, always as a way of explaining\n                    and
  accounting for the appearance of development and change in our\n                    sensory
  experiences. Moral dilemmas in the earlier dialogues gave way in\n                    the
  later ones (Parmenides, Sophist, Statesman) to\n                    logical puzzles
  and challenges.\n                Conceiving of the reality of abstractions like
  Same-\n                        ness and Difference, the Large and the Small, Justice
  and\n                    Beauty, is difficult if we use the familiar world of perception
  as our\n                    touchstone for reality. What Plato's notion of degrees
  of reality can do\n                    for us is to lead the way to viewing the
  world as composed of a wide\n                    variety of things. We need not
  go all the way with the Great Chain of\n                    Being, from lowest and
  earliest095\n                     cells to Angels and God, but it is important for
  a proper\n                    understanding of our many-faceted world to have a
  way of fitting everything\n                    into a coherent view of real- ity.
  The concept\n                    of degrees or kinds of reality enables us to do
  just that, to see that\n                    anything experienced or mentioned, observable
  or conceivable belongs to\n                    the world in some way. We may want
  to make some distinctions, to place\n                    some items in our scheme
  of things in more prominent, more basic places, to\n                    order and
  relate the ingredients of our world in particular ways. What\n                    we
  cannot do is to label some items “ap-\n                        pearance,” if we
  intend thereby to exclude them from\n                    the real. This is not to
  say that the pressures leading philosophers to\n                    contrast appearance
  with reality are any the less forceful and demanding.\n                    It is
  only to say that, however we view the contrast between sensing\n                    and
  conceiving, between concrete particulars and ab-\n                        stract
  concepts, we have to recognize that that contrast is\n                    itself
  made within reality.\n                The Platonic doctrine of degrees of reality
  lends itself to religion in two\n                    different ways. In the hands
  of Plotinus it leads to a mystical metaphysic\n                    with a divine
  One as the culmination of the scale of being. All else\n                    is conceived
  as emanations from this One. Spinoza gave voice later to a\n                    similar
  metaphysic of totality—as Parmenides did\n                    before—but with more
  intellectual and less mystical content,\n                    though Spinoza's goal
  was also moral and religious. The doctrine of\n                    degrees of reality
  also lends itself to the intellectual attempts to\n                    articulate
  and justify a belief in God. Both Saint Anselm and Descartes\n                    made
  use of this notion in their proofs for God's existence. This use of\n                    the
  notion is, however, not central to the idea of appear- ance and reality. What is
  central and characteristic\n                    of much seventeenth-century philosophical
  use of this idea is\n                    Descartes' insistence that physical reality
  can be understood, not sensed or imagined. What the un- derstanding reveals is a
  world of geometrical proper- ties, extension being the essential\n                    category.
  The famous wax example in his Meditations\n                    (Part I) echoes the
  Greek rejection of the sense-world as real; his\n                    proof for body
  concludes that there is body but that it may not be as\n                    it seems
  to our senses.\n                A strong motive behind the metaphysic of Descartes
  was the concern to find a\n                    conceptual basis for the formulation
  and understanding of science; he\n                    sought to provide the categories
  and the method for seeing the world\n                    in scientific terms. The
  category of extension, like its corresponding\n                    category of thought,
  was a non- sensory\n                    concept. Descartes did not think of sense
  expe-\n                        rience as less real (though he exploited its possibilities
  for\n                    deception), but he insisted that sensation will not yield
  a knowledge of\n                    matter or mind. Importance is clearly given
  to the nonsensory. The basic principles\n                     of science were to
  be found in the basic simples (the simple\n                    natures) of his metaphysic.\n
  \               The seventeenth-century philosophers were particu-\n                        larly
  concerned with science. Leibniz is equally repre- sentative with Descartes. The\n
  \                   concept of monads— immaterial atoms, each very much like\n                    Parmenides'
  One—was Leibniz' metaphysical way of capturing\n                    some of the
  principles he thought science needed to explain and formulate\n                    the
  nature of body and motion. Activity for him was a basic scientific and\n                    metaphysical
  category. Leibniz' program is especially important in the\n                    history
  of this idea of appearance and reality be-\n                        cause of the
  way in which the philosophical expression of that\n                    idea in his
  metaphysical writings was antici-\n                    pated by his own attempts
  to deal mathematically and intellectually\n                    with the science
  of motion. The threefold appeal of this idea in the\n                    history
  of thought—the reli- gious,\n                    the scientific, and the metaphysical—is
  at work in Leibniz. He\n                    liked to say that the experienced phe-
  nomena\n                    (the appearances) were well-founded: just the sort of
  phenomena we would\n                    expect if the world was really composed
  of the immaterial atoms he said it\n                    was. At the metaphysical
  level, we find in Leibniz a whole series of\n                    translations from
  ordinary language and expe-\n                    rience to the language and reality
  of monads. The world conceived as\n                    colonies of different kinds
  of monads has God as a sort of super-monad.\n                        Immate- riality
  and self-contained\n                    actions are the basic features of the world
  at the real (i.e., monadic)\n                    level.\n                Conceptualization
  of monads is not easy. Acceptance of tiny imperceptible\n                    material
  monads or atoms has always proved far easier. The Corpuscular\n                    Hypothesis
  used by seventeenth-century scientists in England, adopted\n                    by
  Locke in his philosophy, does not make any unnecessary demands on our\n                    thought,
  since it thinks of those corpuscular entities on analogy with\n                    gross
  bodies. Whenever philosophers move into a metaphysic of appearance\n                    and
  reality, where some of the items ascribed to reality put a strain on\n                    our
  easy conceptualization rooted in the perceptual world, spe- cial problems arise
  about explaining what the\n                    real status of those items is. In
  almost all cases, such tran- scendent items can be seen to work well\n                    as
  explanatory concepts. The difficulties appear\n                    when those items
  are given an ontological status as well. Leibniz seems\n                    to have
  recognized something of these difficulties in hisDiscourse on Metaphysics (1686)
  where, at one point,\n                    he suggests that talk of monads may only
  be a manner of speaking. To\n                    conceive of almost any transcendent
  abstraction as having ontological\n                    status, without deifying
  it, is indeed troublesome.\n                One interesting way around some of these
  problems is found in Spinoza's use\n                    of the distinction of appear-
  ance and\n                    reality. What Spinoza did was to eliminate096\n                     from
  his metaphysic all transcendent items, including the\n                    traditional
  God of the Judeo-Christian tradition. Instead, the totality of\n                    that
  which is is itself deified. Traditional divine attributes are still\n                    ascribed
  to this totality, but Spinoza is very explicit in warning us\n                    not
  to be misled by these ascriptions. God or Substance is infinite,\n                    possessed
  of infinite attributes, cause of all and cause of itself, but is\n                    not
  different from all that is. What Spinoza's use of this idea requires is\n                    a
  shift in our understanding, not an acceptance of any new or strange\n                    metaphysical
  entities. Everything in the world, the most common and\n                    ordinary
  as well, can be viewed and understood in two different ways.\n                    From
  the point of view of appearance and ordinary percep- tion, this glass of water,
  this table, this book is\n                    finite, in time, caused, subject to
  change, and possessed of the\n                    sensory properties we sense it
  as having. But these same objects can be\n                    placed in a different
  perspective where their particularity does not\n                    disappear, but
  where it is viewed from the perspective of the totality\n                    and
  that particularity can be seen as modifications of the totality.\n                    Viewing
  the world (better, the totality of everything) as a whole, as a\n                    unit,
  very general categor- ies can be used\n                    to encompass everything.
  Of all that there is that we know (and Spinoza\n                    accepted the
  limi- tation of human\n                    knowledge), it is either extended or
  immaterial (i.e., thought). These\n                    categories are\n                    proper-
  ties of the whole, but only insofar\n                    as there are particu- lar
  extended and\n                    thinking things. Viewing particular objects in
  this way takes us outside\n                    time and causation, because time
  and causation are features of\n                    particular objects only. The
  totality is timeless and uncaused.\n                Parmenides is obviously reincarnated
  but trans-\n                        formed in this Spinozistic conception. The problem
  of conceiving\n                    of transcendent entities has disappeared, to
  be replaced by what may be a\n                    difference in kind of predication.
  That is, when Spinoza says God or Sub- stance is cause of itself, is\n                    “cause”
  being used in the same way, with the same\n                    meaning, as in more
  ordinary causal judgments? Clearly not, in part because\n                        causa
  sui really means\n                    “uncaused,” in part because the ascription
  of\n                    extension or thought to the totality which is Spinoza's
  Substance is a\n                    tacit way of ascribing these predicates to particular
  objects. Only\n                    particular mem- bers of the totality change and\n
  \                   are caused, occupy space and time. But because these individuals
  taken\n                    together constitute the totality, the totality—not as
  a\n                    collection but as a whole—also has these\n                    properties,
  but not in the sense that it occupies space and time,\n                    changes,
  and is caused.\n                One cannot be sure to what extent the borrowed meanings
  of his concepts from\n                    traditional religious doctrine gave a
  religious flavor to Spinoza's demytho\n                    logized metaphysic of
  Substance. Spinoza was an in- tense, meditative man; his attitude towards life was\n
  \                   moralist and humane rather than coolly intellectual. The concepts
  of his\n                    metaphysic were not fashioned to deal with logical puzzles;
  they were to\n                    deliver him and mankind from human bondage: “from
  his\n                    intellect / And from the stillness of abstracted thought
  / He asked\n                    repose” (Wordsworth, “The Wanderer,” lines\n                    313-15).
  Intellectual understanding is in the service of enlightenment and\n                    well-being.
  The Ethics of Spinoza offers us a way of\n                    life, not one that
  requires us to forsake practice and action but one which\n                    adds
  under- standing and peace of mind to\n                    our daily lives. But of
  course, such a way to happiness and well-being is\n                    not practicable
  or even feasible for many. The mental and emotional\n                    state of
  mind requisite for finding, in this abstract concretizing of\n                    appearance
  and reality, the peace (one could almost say beatitude) that\n                    does
  not pass but comes through understanding is rare in man- kind.\n                While
  the naturalization of deity, characteristic of seventeenth-century\n                    deists,
  easily lends itself to the kind of romantic religious attitude\n                    toward
  nature found in Wordsworth, it would be difficult to think of\n                    Spinoza's
  deification of nature finding a direct appli- cation in literature. One might expect
  to find\n                    something like it in the metaphysical poets, but their
  conceits were\n                    abstract and often contorted though not meta-\n
  \                       physical. For artists usually, for Wordsworth in partic-
  ular, experience of nature, not\n                    abstracted thought, provides
  the mark of reality. Sometimes the artist\n                    is content to record
  the appearance of things, the sensu- ous content is valuable enough. At other times,
  as\n                    in Wordsworth's case, familiar perceptual objects are seen
  as having\n                    an “inward meaning,” they reveal “the one\n                    Presence,
  and the Life / Of the great whole” (The Prelude, II, lines 129-31). Unlike the academic
  studies\n                    at Cambridge, which seemed to the poet of The\n                    Prelude
  to take him away from the “sentiment of\n                    Being,” experience
  of nature—the woods, mountains,\n                    lakes of Windermere—enables
  him to converse “With\n                    things that really are” (II, lines 412-13).
  The boundaries\n                    of our perceptual world, the “cabinet of our\n
  \                   sensations,” can be transcended if we respond to “the\n                    latent
  quali- ties / And essences of\n                    things” (II, lines 223-29, 344-45).
  “To thee,\n                    unblinded by these outward shows, / The unity of
  all has been\n                    reveal'd” (II, lines 225-26).\n                There
  is Platonism, of course, in Wordsworth. The eternal Beauty of the\n                    Forms
  reappears, with the famous “Ode—Intimations of\n                    Immortality”
  typifying this fea- ture\n                    of his thought. But the important
  characteristic of Wordsworth's poetry for\n                    the history of the
  idea of appearance and reality is the deistic, natural religion097\n                     of
  his longer poems. The intellectual tradition upon which\n                    Wordsworth
  drew in his nature poetry is the same one to which deists and\n                    Spinoza
  belonged. No sharp contrast between appearance and reality is\n                    drawn,
  the totality of appearances and phenomena is\n                    reality, but the
  perceptive person will come to view those objects in a way\n                    which
  reveals the meanings latent in them. Deists, Wordsworth, and Spinoza,\n                    in
  their respective ways worked within a unified, non- transcendent notion of reality
  but\n                    drew distinctions of value within the one Being. All three
  did so for inspi- rational purposes. Appearances are\n                    not rejected
  or denied a place in reality, they become reality when\n                    experienced
  and understood in the proper way.\n                William Blake is another interesting
  though obscure example of a literary\n                    application of metaphysical
  con- cepts. The\n                    interpretation of Blake is difficult. Platonism
  and Berkeleyan idealism at\n                    least seem to have com- bined to
  influence his\n                    literary and aesthetic convictions. Northrop
  Frye (Fearful Symmetry...) cites those passages where Blake clearly\n                    echoes
  Berkeley, e.g., “nothing is real beyond the imaginative\n                    patterns
  men make of reality” (p. 19). Wordsworth's deism is\n                        mis-
  leading for Blake, since it credits\n                    to nature the realities
  of the imagination. The Platonism of Blake,\n                    which G. M. Harper
  stresses in his study, The\n                        Neoplatonism of William Blake,
  finds expression in such passages\n                    as “Imagination, the real
  and eternal World of which this\n                    Vegetable Universe is but a
  faint shadow”\n                    (“Jerusalem,” in Blake, The\n                        Complete
  Writings, ed. G. Keynes [1957], p. 717), and\n                    “There Exist in
  that Eternal World the Permanent Realities of\n                    Every Thing which
  we see reflected in this Vegetable Glass of\n                    Nature” (“A Vision
  of the Last Judgment,”\n                    ibid., pp. 605-06). Harper cites several
  passages which seem to show Blake\n                    giving independent existence
  to the Forms discovered (or created) by\n                    the imagination. For
  example, “Whatever can be Created can be\n                    Annihilated: Forms
  cannot: / The Oak is cut down by the Ax, the Lamb falls\n                    by
  the Knife, / But their Forms Eternal Exist For-ever”\n                    (“Milton,”
  ibid., p. 522). While Blake also seems to\n                    retain something
  of the doctrine of “degrees or kinds of\n                    reality,” e.g., in
  speaking of the worlds of vision, sight, and\n                    memory, Frye insists
  that “These are not three different\n                    worlds”; they are rather
  three different ways of looking at the\n                    one world (p. 26).\n
  \               Whether we view Blake through the metaphysics of Berkeley or of
  Plato is not\n                    all that important, though both ingredients seem
  to be there. What is\n                    important to see—and Blake is an ideal
  case—is the\n                    way in which metaphysical concepts are used but
  transmuted by the\n                    literary mind. Blake was more interested
  in artistic and aesthetic\n                    adaptations of Plato and Berkeley
  than in\n                     their doctrines themselves. The concept of form as
  a\n                    metaphysical entity is replaced by that of archetype. The
  artist generally\n                    is one who, via vision working on particulars,
  captures universal and\n                    archetypal forms. Metaphysical idealism
  supplies the artist with an intel- lectual justification of the truths he\n                    learns
  from his own experience about the creative imagination and the\n                    activity
  of the mind. Platonism enables him to give more than a passing\n                    reality
  to the forms of the imagi- nation.\n                    The Platonic real world
  becomes the world of the imagination.\n                Kant's philosophy provided
  many of the Romantics, especially Coleridge, with\n                    an even stronger
  and more attractive philosophical understanding for their\n                    artistic
  activities. Schiller's aesthetic interpretations of Kant\n                    probably
  had a strong influence upon the conceptuali- zations of the romantic imagination.
  Kant provided\n                    a different kind of merging of phenomenal and
  real from that of\n                    Spinoza. Working with the same totality of
  things, Kant gave to the mind\n                    the fundamental forma- tive and
  shaping powers\n                    of the world of experience. The real world just
  is\n                    the world we experience, but its structure and order are
  not contingent and\n                    external to mind, for they are necessary
  products of mental activity.\n                    Kant's moral philosophy might
  seem to retain a separation between\n                    phenomenal (appearance)
  and real, with its appeal to an intelligible world\n                    as a way
  of explaining how human action can break out of the causal\n                    uniformities
  of nature, but the conceptual grounding of the Metaphysical Foundations of Morals
  (1797) should\n                    more properly be seen as a recognition of the
  difference in the causality\n                    of events and actions. The causality
  of agency in action (and by\n                    extension, of creative imagination)
  was an important philo- sophical prop for artists, especially\n                    poets,
  of the eighteenth century, in freeing them from what was\n                    believed
  (albeit falsely) to be Locke's failure to recog- nize the activity of mind in his
  influential account\n                    of the human understanding.\n                Interestingly,
  the philosophical recognition of men-\n                    tal activity, even to
  the extent of giving to mind form- ative and determining functions of reality, emerged\n
  \                   out of a metaphysic which rejected the sharp separation of appearance\n
  \                   and reality. Where artists interpret their goal as capturing
  reality,\n                    dualisms which place reality in a realm separate from
  direct experience of\n                        phenom- ena place a barrier in front
  of\n                    artistic activity. Platonic visionaries could claim access
  into the realm\n                    of Forms (experience of beauty was one path
  to the Forms rec- ognized by Plato), Wordsworthian and\n                    Spinozistic
  deists and pantheists could claim the ability to capture\n                    the
  living forms in nature. But still more attractive is the notion that\n                    the
  creative imagination takes its place098\n                     alongside the other
  mental apparatus elaborated by Kant and\n                    plays a formative role
  in determining the real. Since Kant, most literary\n                    and artistic
  support in philosophy has come from the Kantian and\n                    Hegelian
  merging of appearance and reality.\n                Hegel gave the most grandiose
  construction to this new metaphysics. The Phenomenology of Mind (1807) is a rich
  and, in its\n                    own way, artistic work. The philo-\n                    sophical
  tradition is that of Spinoza, deists, and pan- theists, with many a debt to Kant.
  No sharp breaks in\n                    the scale of being, smooth transitions from
  one level or kind to the next,\n                    until in Absolute Spirit we
  have Hegel's attempt to formulate in abstract\n                    and semireli-
  gious concepts the unified\n                    totality of all the levels and kinds
  of reality and appearance. Unlike the\n                    aesthetic approach of
  Wordsworth, which revealed the most abstract\n                    truth of reality
  by sensory exposure, Hegel's conceptual genius enables us\n                    to
  apply the concepts of his metaphysic to sensory, social, political, and\n                    religious
  experiences. We find in Hegel an application of meta- physical concepts to illuminate
  life,\n                    not just art. The social tensions of master and slave,
  of ruler and\n                    ruled, the intellectual tensions of experience
  and under- standing, of change and law are\n                    viewed through the
  dialectic and structure of his metaphysic.\n                The Hegelian influence
  was massive, even within the English-speaking world.\n                    It also
  was largely responsible for the decline and rejection of\n                    metaphysics
  in twentieth-century English philosophy: those who were\n                    opposed
  to metaphysics took Hegel as their example, even though few of the\n                    positivists
  and scientific empir- icists had\n                    any intimate understanding
  of Hegel. Never-\n                        theless, even within these new forms of
  empiricism, with their\n                    reliance upon logic and science, dualisms
  of appearance and reality emerged\n                    again. Philosophers saw science
  as the authority on the nature of the\n                    world; but, since the
  scientific account talked of unobservable\n                    particles, the world
  of ordinary human experience had to be given some\n                    place in
  reality. The sense-datum theories of Bertrand Russell, G. E.\n                    Moore,
  C. D. Broad, and H. H. Price tried to relate appearances to\n                    reality
  as effect to cause. Human knowledge was immediately and mainly\n                    of
  sense qualities, indirectly and inferen-\n                        tially of the
  scientifically designated causes. Knowledge by\n                    acquaintance
  and knowledge by description (a dis-\n                        tinction first made
  by William James in Principles\n                        of Psychology, New York
  [1890], I, 221) was Russell's way of\n                    formulating the epistemic
  access we have to ap-\n                        pearances and reality. The transitions
  and develop- ments of dualism and phenomenalism of previous cen- turies now reappeared
  (almost as Hegel's\n                    dialectic predicted) in the new but transformed
  garbs of New Realism,\n                    Critical Realism, and Common Sense Direct
  Realism. These have been almost\n                    exclusively English\n                     and
  American formulations, debates still not com- pleted. (See R. J. Hirst's The Problems\n
  \                       of Perception for a good summary and discussion of many
  of\n                    these issues.)\n                Continental metaphysical
  concerns during the twentieth century have stayed\n                    strictly
  within the Kantian and Hegelian tradition. Edmund Husserl's\n                    phenomenology
  became the dominant mode. Two fea-\n                    tures characterize Husserl's
  philosophy: a method of analysis and a\n                    new ontology of meaning.
  The meta- physical\n                    dictum here is “the world is my world,”
  the world of\n                    lived, human experience. The whole realm of experience
  becomes a field for\n                    analysis, everything now becomes phenomena.
  Perhaps more stress has\n                    been placed by Husserl's followers
  upon the method of\n                    analysis—supposedly unbiased and free from
  all ontological\n                    prejudices—than upon the ontology. Ques-\n
  \                       tions of reality are supposed to be set aside as useless,\n
  \                   attention is then free to look to the descriptions of all and
  any\n                    phenomena. But there is a metaphysic here all the same,
  a metaphysic of\n                    experience which is clearly Kantian and Hegelian.
  Since the stress is\n                    upon experience as lived and interpreted
  by men, meaning becomes the\n                    central concept, meaning for me.
  The union of reality in and for itself\n                        (en-soi et pour-soi),
  upon which the\n                    phenomenological metaphysic of ex- perience\n
  \                   rests, has been reformulated by Sartre inBeing and Nothingness
  (L'Etre et le\n                        néant, 1943). That union is possible only
  because\n                    man is the center of this world.\n                Sartre
  and other existentialist writers, in their liter- ary productions, seized upon the
  emotions of man as\n                    the most significant definers of reality:
  anguish, dread, loneliness. The\n                    reality of a life can be experienced
  best, they believe, in confrontations\n                    with death, fear, and
  dread—a far cry from the tranquility and\n                    peace of Wordsworth's
  real world. Husserl's phenomenology has had\n                    widespread impact
  upon literature, psychology, psychoanalysis, religion,\n                    and
  philosophy, even upon social science and education. Moreover, that\n                    impact
  has finally been felt in the English-speaking world. But the\n                    existentialist
  writers—and the art of the absurd in\n                    general—have narrowed
  the scope of reality so much that some of\n                    them are close to
  denying all reality. “Authentic”\n                    experience is privileged and
  rare, perhaps impossible; reality as meaning\n                    for a person may
  be slipping from our grasp: such seems to be the\n                    message of
  much of existentialist writing. They are close to\n                    presenting
  us with the negation of the romantic striving for and belief in\n                    a
  new and better reality in or behind appearances. Samuel Beckett's\n                    noncharacters
  find no meaning and very little reality in their experience.\n                    It
  makes little difference whether Godot is given a reli- gious interpretation, or
  whether it is secularized and099\n                     taken to signify a meaning
  for the world. Beckett's early\n                    characters are waiting for meaning
  to appear out of the routine\n                    concatenation of ordinary events.
  His later characters have given up\n                    entirely on Godot, and merely
  live out their meaningless experiences in\n                    absurd and unreal
  environments. Autonomy, creativity, and value have\n                    been replaced
  by one-dimensional man living out his time in a controlled\n                    but
  meaningless world. Parmenides' denial to appearances of any status\n                    in
  reality has found its contemporary formulation within a metaphysic which\n                    identifies
  reality with ap- pearances. The\n                    total annihilation threatened
  by the bomb has found its literary and\n                    philosophic counterpart
  in this denial of reality to the only reality left,\n                    the reality
  of lived human experience.\n                It is difficult to predict the future
  of this idea of appearance and\n                    reality. Its apotheosis in metaphysics
  and literature has had a parallel in\n                    religion and theol- ogy:
  the transcendence of\n                    God has struggled with the meaningful
  immanence of human life. In many\n                    modern theologies, religious
  meaning seems to have followed the\n                    direction of existentialist
  writers, being located in personal attitudes\n                    towards man and
  the world. The metaphysic of transcendent entities thus\n                    seems
  on all fronts to have given way to the phenomenological\n                    categories:
  reality is as it is interpreted as being in human experience.\n                    What
  there is has become a func- tion of what\n                    man finds meaningful
  and valuable in his experience. Parmenides denied\n                    reality to
  appearances. Our contemporaries are close to denying reality\n                    to
  reality. Such an ultimate denial would be the complete reversal of\n                    the
  appearance-reality distinction.\n                \n                    \n                        BIBLIOGRAPHY\n

  general sense of the contrast between\n                    appearance and reality
  would be any difference between what is the\n                    case and what appears
  to be so. Thus, the ordinary appearance of a person\n                    frequently
  conceals his real feelings and thoughts, the appearance of a\n                    village
  may be one of tranquility, but the reality one of turmoil,\n                    hatred,
  etc. The more specific sense of this contrast arose out of\n                    philosophical
  concerns about the nature of the world. The concept of\n                    “world”
  and of “reality” in\n                    this philosophical concern is related to
  but different from the ordinary\n                    concept. Early Greek cosmologists
  interpreted the perceived world in terms\n                    of causal and intentional
  forces of the gods. Pre-Socratic philoso- phers, searching for secular\n                    explanations,
  came to draw a sharp contrast between the perceived world and\n                    the
  ultimate “real stuff.” Water, air, atoms,\n                    abstract notions
  like “unlimited” or\n                    “boundless,” and “mind” were\n                    offered
  as the stuff of which the world is really made or in terms of which\n                    understanding
  of the world must be made. Greek atomism is a prime example.\n                    All
  observed properties and qualities of objects were explained in\n                    terms
  of the shape and motion of insensi- ble\n                    material particles.
  This account of reality was not only important in\n                    itself, it
  was, at least to Lucretius later, of ethical and emotional value\n                    in
  leading man via understanding to happiness (cf. Spinoza).The atomistic way of thinking
  of the cause and ground of the perceived world\n                    is easiest for
  us to accept since it fits in well with the early forms of\n                    atomism
  in modern physics. As recent science has moved to more and\n                    more
  abstractions, e.g., energy, force, fields, etc., the analogy of real\n                    world
  to the perceived world has given way. Those abstract concepts in\n                    Greek
  thought—the boundless, Parmenides' One, Plato's\n                    Forms—likewise
  required a different mode of thought for their\n                    understanding.
  Even though Parmenides may have thought of the One as in\n                    some
  way physical, the geometrical concepts easily emerged from his concep- tualization
  of the One. The\n                    contrast between what appears to be the case
  and what is in fact so is\n                    sharp and striking. Parmenides' recommendation,
  again as much for\n                    moral as for intellectual reasons, was to
  turn our backs on the way of\n                    appearance and to contem- plate
  the way of\n                    truth and reality. The contrast was so complete
  that sense experience was\n                    contradictory to reality: what the
  senses report cannot be true since\n                    motion is unreal. The paradoxes
  of Zeno simply played upon this Parmenidean\n                    contrast of appearance
  and reality. The senses are denied, are unreal.This striking Parmenidean contrast
  set many prob-\n                    lems for Plato and subsequent philosophers.
  The chal- lenge of the paradoxes had to be met, one cannot carry\n                     out
  Parmenides' radical denial of all that our senses report.\n                    The
  most fundamental difficulty in a concept of reality such as Parmenides\n                    advanced
  is the implied if not explicit denial to the perceived world of\n                        any
  status in reality. Bradley was much later to\n                    point out that,
  no matter how different our philosophy may make\n                    appearances
  from reality, there is an important sense in which the\n                    appearances
  must occupy some place in reality. The Bradleyan concept of\n                    reality
  owes much to Hegel, where radical contrasts and differences\n                    tend
  to disappear in a dialectical flow: reality becomes the totality\n                    of
  that which is, Spinoza's facies totius\n                    Universi (“the whole
  aspect of the\n                    universe”). But quite apart from such an Hegelian
  transformation\n                    of the concept of reality, there is an important
  truth in the\n                    insistence that anything, appearances as well
  as nonappearances,are in some sense. At least the status is that they exist as appearances.
  Plato put the point\n                    trenchantly in having Socrates ask (Republic
  V,\n                    476D), “When you know something, do you know something that
  is\n                    or something that is not?” The conclusion from this ques-
  tion has to be (as both Plato and\n                    Parmenides agreed) that that
  which is not can neither be nor be conceived.To make room for sense perception which
  reveals a world of change and\n                    motion, of diversity and differ-
  ence, Plato\n                    elaborated a conception of different degrees and
  kinds of realness. The\n                    most real—his Forms—fulfill the role
  of reality in\n                    the more simple notions of appearance and reality:
  the Forms play\n                    causal, semantic, and moral roles. The intellectual
  understanding of the\n                    Forms has an alternate, aesthetic mode.
  Both modes are sought for social,\n                    political, and ethical enlightenment
  and guidance. Plato stresses a\n                    pattern frequently repeated
  in the history of this idea. While it is\n                    reasonable to conclude
  that it was the moral fervor of Socrates seeking\n                    definitions
  of ethical con- cepts which led\n                    Plato to the notions of permanent,
  unchanging standards, the intellectual\n                    puzzles of Parmenides
  and Zeno influenced the later development of\n                    Plato's doctrine.
  Ideas of Sameness, Difference, and Existence found their\n                    elaboration
  in the later doctrine of Forms, always as a way of explaining\n                    and
  accounting for the appearance of development and change in our\n                    sensory
  experiences. Moral dilemmas in the earlier dialogues gave way in\n                    the
  later ones (Parmenides, Sophist, Statesman) to\n                    logical puzzles
  and challenges.Conceiving of the reality of abstractions like Same-\n                        ness
  and Difference, the Large and the Small, Justice and\n                    Beauty,
  is difficult if we use the familiar world of perception as our\n                    touchstone
  for reality. What Plato's notion of degrees of reality can do\n                    for
  us is to lead the way to viewing the world as composed of a wide\n                    variety
  of things. We need not go all the way with the Great Chain of\n                    Being,
  from lowest and earliestThe Platonic doctrine of degrees of reality lends itself
  to religion in two\n                    different ways. In the hands of Plotinus
  it leads to a mystical metaphysic\n                    with a divine One as the
  culmination of the scale of being. All else\n                    is conceived as
  emanations from this One. Spinoza gave voice later to a\n                    similar
  metaphysic of totality—as Parmenides did\n                    before—but with more
  intellectual and less mystical content,\n                    though Spinoza's goal
  was also moral and religious. The doctrine of\n                    degrees of reality
  also lends itself to the intellectual attempts to\n                    articulate
  and justify a belief in God. Both Saint Anselm and Descartes\n                    made
  use of this notion in their proofs for God's existence. This use of\n                    the
  notion is, however, not central to the idea of appear- ance and reality. What is
  central and characteristic\n                    of much seventeenth-century philosophical
  use of this idea is\n                    Descartes' insistence that physical reality
  can be understood, not sensed or imagined. What the un- derstanding reveals is a
  world of geometrical proper- ties, extension being the essential\n                    category.
  The famous wax example in his Meditations\n                    (Part I) echoes the
  Greek rejection of the sense-world as real; his\n                    proof for body
  concludes that there is body but that it may not be as\n                    it seems
  to our senses.A strong motive behind the metaphysic of Descartes was the concern
  to find a\n                    conceptual basis for the formulation and understanding
  of science; he\n                    sought to provide the categories and the method
  for seeing the world\n                    in scientific terms. The category of extension,
  like its corresponding\n                    category of thought, was a non- sensory\n
  \                   concept. Descartes did not think of sense expe-\n                        rience
  as less real (though he exploited its possibilities for\n                    deception),
  but he insisted that sensation will not yield a knowledge of\n                    matter
  or mind. Importance is clearly given to the nonsensory. The basic principles\n                     of
  science were to be found in the basic simples (the simple\n                    natures)
  of his metaphysic.The seventeenth-century philosophers were particu-\n                        larly
  concerned with science. Leibniz is equally repre- sentative with Descartes. The\n
  \                   concept of monads— immaterial atoms, each very much like\n                    Parmenides'
  One—was Leibniz' metaphysical way of capturing\n                    some of the
  principles he thought science needed to explain and formulate\n                    the
  nature of body and motion. Activity for him was a basic scientific and\n                    metaphysical
  category. Leibniz' program is especially important in the\n                    history
  of this idea of appearance and reality be-\n                        cause of the
  way in which the philosophical expression of that\n                    idea in his
  metaphysical writings was antici-\n                    pated by his own attempts
  to deal mathematically and intellectually\n                    with the science
  of motion. The threefold appeal of this idea in the\n                    history
  of thought—the reli- gious,\n                    the scientific, and the metaphysical—is
  at work in Leibniz. He\n                    liked to say that the experienced phe-
  nomena\n                    (the appearances) were well-founded: just the sort of
  phenomena we would\n                    expect if the world was really composed
  of the immaterial atoms he said it\n                    was. At the metaphysical
  level, we find in Leibniz a whole series of\n                    translations from
  ordinary language and expe-\n                    rience to the language and reality
  of monads. The world conceived as\n                    colonies of different kinds
  of monads has God as a sort of super-monad.\n                        Immate- riality
  and self-contained\n                    actions are the basic features of the world
  at the real (i.e., monadic)\n                    level.Conceptualization of monads
  is not easy. Acceptance of tiny imperceptible\n                    material monads
  or atoms has always proved far easier. The Corpuscular\n                    Hypothesis
  used by seventeenth-century scientists in England, adopted\n                    by
  Locke in his philosophy, does not make any unnecessary demands on our\n                    thought,
  since it thinks of those corpuscular entities on analogy with\n                    gross
  bodies. Whenever philosophers move into a metaphysic of appearance\n                    and
  reality, where some of the items ascribed to reality put a strain on\n                    our
  easy conceptualization rooted in the perceptual world, spe- cial problems arise
  about explaining what the\n                    real status of those items is. In
  almost all cases, such tran- scendent items can be seen to work well\n                    as
  explanatory concepts. The difficulties appear\n                    when those items
  are given an ontological status as well. Leibniz seems\n                    to have
  recognized something of these difficulties in hisDiscourse on Metaphysics (1686)
  where, at one point,\n                    he suggests that talk of monads may only
  be a manner of speaking. To\n                    conceive of almost any transcendent
  abstraction as having ontological\n                    status, without deifying
  it, is indeed troublesome.One interesting way around some of these problems is found
  in Spinoza's use\n                    of the distinction of appear- ance and\n                    reality.
  What Spinoza did was to eliminateParmenides is obviously reincarnated but trans-\n
  \                       formed in this Spinozistic conception. The problem of conceiving\n
  \                   of transcendent entities has disappeared, to be replaced by
  what may be a\n                    difference in kind of predication. That is, when
  Spinoza says God or Sub- stance is cause of itself, is\n                    “cause”
  being used in the same way, with the same\n                    meaning, as in more
  ordinary causal judgments? Clearly not, in part because\n                        causa
  sui really means\n                    “uncaused,” in part because the ascription
  of\n                    extension or thought to the totality which is Spinoza's
  Substance is a\n                    tacit way of ascribing these predicates to particular
  objects. Only\n                    particular mem- bers of the totality change and\n
  \                   are caused, occupy space and time. But because these individuals
  taken\n                    together constitute the totality, the totality—not as
  a\n                    collection but as a whole—also has these\n                    properties,
  but not in the sense that it occupies space and time,\n                    changes,
  and is caused.One cannot be sure to what extent the borrowed meanings of his concepts
  from\n                    traditional religious doctrine gave a religious flavor
  to Spinoza's demytho\n                    logized metaphysic of Substance. Spinoza
  was an in- tense, meditative man; his attitude towards life was\n                    moralist
  and humane rather than coolly intellectual. The concepts of his\n                    metaphysic
  were not fashioned to deal with logical puzzles; they were to\n                    deliver
  him and mankind from human bondage: “from his\n                    intellect / And
  from the stillness of abstracted thought / He asked\n                    repose”
  (Wordsworth, “The Wanderer,” lines\n                    313-15). Intellectual understanding
  is in the service of enlightenment and\n                    well-being. The Ethics
  of Spinoza offers us a way of\n                    life, not one that requires us
  to forsake practice and action but one which\n                    adds under- standing
  and peace of mind to\n                    our daily lives. But of course, such a
  way to happiness and well-being is\n                    not practicable or even
  feasible for many. The mental and emotional\n                    state of mind requisite
  for finding, in this abstract concretizing of\n                    appearance and
  reality, the peace (one could almost say beatitude) that\n                    does
  not pass but comes through understanding is rare in man- kind.While the naturalization
  of deity, characteristic of seventeenth-century\n                    deists, easily
  lends itself to the kind of romantic religious attitude\n                    toward
  nature found in Wordsworth, it would be difficult to think of\n                    Spinoza's
  deification of nature finding a direct appli- cation in literature. One might expect
  to find\n                    something like it in the metaphysical poets, but their
  conceits were\n                    abstract and often contorted though not meta-\n
  \                       physical. For artists usually, for Wordsworth in partic-
  ular, experience of nature, not\n                    abstracted thought, provides
  the mark of reality. Sometimes the artist\n                    is content to record
  the appearance of things, the sensu- ous content is valuable enough. At other times,
  as\n                    in Wordsworth's case, familiar perceptual objects are seen
  as having\n                    an “inward meaning,” they reveal “the one\n                    Presence,
  and the Life / Of the great whole” (The Prelude, II, lines 129-31). Unlike the academic
  studies\n                    at Cambridge, which seemed to the poet of The\n                    Prelude
  to take him away from the “sentiment of\n                    Being,” experience
  of nature—the woods, mountains,\n                    lakes of Windermere—enables
  him to converse “With\n                    things that really are” (II, lines 412-13).
  The boundaries\n                    of our perceptual world, the “cabinet of our\n
  \                   sensations,” can be transcended if we respond to “the\n                    latent
  quali- ties / And essences of\n                    things” (II, lines 223-29, 344-45).
  “To thee,\n                    unblinded by these outward shows, / The unity of
  all has been\n                    reveal'd” (II, lines 225-26).There is Platonism,
  of course, in Wordsworth. The eternal Beauty of the\n                    Forms reappears,
  with the famous “Ode—Intimations of\n                    Immortality” typifying
  this fea- ture\n                    of his thought. But the important characteristic
  of Wordsworth's poetry for\n                    the history of the idea of appearance
  and reality is the deistic, natural religionWilliam Blake is another interesting
  though obscure example of a literary\n                    application of metaphysical
  con- cepts. The\n                    interpretation of Blake is difficult. Platonism
  and Berkeleyan idealism at\n                    least seem to have com- bined to
  influence his\n                    literary and aesthetic convictions. Northrop
  Frye (Fearful Symmetry...) cites those passages where Blake clearly\n                    echoes
  Berkeley, e.g., “nothing is real beyond the imaginative\n                    patterns
  men make of reality” (p. 19). Wordsworth's deism is\n                        mis-
  leading for Blake, since it credits\n                    to nature the realities
  of the imagination. The Platonism of Blake,\n                    which G. M. Harper
  stresses in his study, The\n                        Neoplatonism of William Blake,
  finds expression in such passages\n                    as “Imagination, the real
  and eternal World of which this\n                    Vegetable Universe is but a
  faint shadow”\n                    (“Jerusalem,” in Blake, The\n                        Complete
  Writings, ed. G. Keynes [1957], p. 717), and\n                    “There Exist in
  that Eternal World the Permanent Realities of\n                    Every Thing which
  we see reflected in this Vegetable Glass of\n                    Nature” (“A Vision
  of the Last Judgment,”\n                    ibid., pp. 605-06). Harper cites several
  passages which seem to show Blake\n                    giving independent existence
  to the Forms discovered (or created) by\n                    the imagination. For
  example, “Whatever can be Created can be\n                    Annihilated: Forms
  cannot: / The Oak is cut down by the Ax, the Lamb falls\n                    by
  the Knife, / But their Forms Eternal Exist For-ever”\n                    (“Milton,”
  ibid., p. 522). While Blake also seems to\n                    retain something
  of the doctrine of “degrees or kinds of\n                    reality,” e.g., in
  speaking of the worlds of vision, sight, and\n                    memory, Frye insists
  that “These are not three different\n                    worlds”; they are rather
  three different ways of looking at the\n                    one world (p. 26).Whether
  we view Blake through the metaphysics of Berkeley or of Plato is not\n                    all
  that important, though both ingredients seem to be there. What is\n                    important
  to see—and Blake is an ideal case—is the\n                    way in which metaphysical
  concepts are used but transmuted by the\n                    literary mind. Blake
  was more interested in artistic and aesthetic\n                    adaptations of
  Plato and Berkeley than in\n                     their doctrines themselves. The
  concept of form as a\n                    metaphysical entity is replaced by that
  of archetype. The artist generally\n                    is one who, via vision working
  on particulars, captures universal and\n                    archetypal forms. Metaphysical
  idealism supplies the artist with an intel- lectual justification of the truths
  he\n                    learns from his own experience about the creative imagination
  and the\n                    activity of the mind. Platonism enables him to give
  more than a passing\n                    reality to the forms of the imagi- nation.\n
  \                   The Platonic real world becomes the world of the imagination.Kant's
  philosophy provided many of the Romantics, especially Coleridge, with\n                    an
  even stronger and more attractive philosophical understanding for their\n                    artistic
  activities. Schiller's aesthetic interpretations of Kant\n                    probably
  had a strong influence upon the conceptuali- zations of the romantic imagination.
  Kant provided\n                    a different kind of merging of phenomenal and
  real from that of\n                    Spinoza. Working with the same totality of
  things, Kant gave to the mind\n                    the fundamental forma- tive and
  shaping powers\n                    of the world of experience. The real world just
  is\n                    the world we experience, but its structure and order are
  not contingent and\n                    external to mind, for they are necessary
  products of mental activity.\n                    Kant's moral philosophy might
  seem to retain a separation between\n                    phenomenal (appearance)
  and real, with its appeal to an intelligible world\n                    as a way
  of explaining how human action can break out of the causal\n                    uniformities
  of nature, but the conceptual grounding of the Metaphysical Foundations of Morals
  (1797) should\n                    more properly be seen as a recognition of the
  difference in the causality\n                    of events and actions. The causality
  of agency in action (and by\n                    extension, of creative imagination)
  was an important philo- sophical prop for artists, especially\n                    poets,
  of the eighteenth century, in freeing them from what was\n                    believed
  (albeit falsely) to be Locke's failure to recog- nize the activity of mind in his
  influential account\n                    of the human understanding.Interestingly,
  the philosophical recognition of men-\n                    tal activity, even to
  the extent of giving to mind form- ative and determining functions of reality, emerged\n
  \                   out of a metaphysic which rejected the sharp separation of appearance\n
  \                   and reality. Where artists interpret their goal as capturing
  reality,\n                    dualisms which place reality in a realm separate from
  direct experience of\n                        phenom- ena place a barrier in front
  of\n                    artistic activity. Platonic visionaries could claim access
  into the realm\n                    of Forms (experience of beauty was one path
  to the Forms rec- ognized by Plato), Wordsworthian and\n                    Spinozistic
  deists and pantheists could claim the ability to capture\n                    the
  living forms in nature. But still more attractive is the notion that\n                    the
  creative imagination takes its placeHegel gave the most grandiose construction to
  this new metaphysics. The Phenomenology of Mind (1807) is a rich and, in its\n                    own
  way, artistic work. The philo-\n                    sophical tradition is that of
  Spinoza, deists, and pan- theists, with many a debt to Kant. No sharp breaks in\n
  \                   the scale of being, smooth transitions from one level or kind
  to the next,\n                    until in Absolute Spirit we have Hegel's attempt
  to formulate in abstract\n                    and semireli- gious concepts the unified\n
  \                   totality of all the levels and kinds of reality and appearance.
  Unlike the\n                    aesthetic approach of Wordsworth, which revealed
  the most abstract\n                    truth of reality by sensory exposure, Hegel's
  conceptual genius enables us\n                    to apply the concepts of his metaphysic
  to sensory, social, political, and\n                    religious experiences. We
  find in Hegel an application of meta- physical concepts to illuminate life,\n                    not
  just art. The social tensions of master and slave, of ruler and\n                    ruled,
  the intellectual tensions of experience and under- standing, of change and law are\n
  \                   viewed through the dialectic and structure of his metaphysic.The
  Hegelian influence was massive, even within the English-speaking world.\n                    It
  also was largely responsible for the decline and rejection of\n                    metaphysics
  in twentieth-century English philosophy: those who were\n                    opposed
  to metaphysics took Hegel as their example, even though few of the\n                    positivists
  and scientific empir- icists had\n                    any intimate understanding
  of Hegel. Never-\n                        theless, even within these new forms of
  empiricism, with their\n                    reliance upon logic and science, dualisms
  of appearance and reality emerged\n                    again. Philosophers saw science
  as the authority on the nature of the\n                    world; but, since the
  scientific account talked of unobservable\n                    particles, the world
  of ordinary human experience had to be given some\n                    place in
  reality. The sense-datum theories of Bertrand Russell, G. E.\n                    Moore,
  C. D. Broad, and H. H. Price tried to relate appearances to\n                    reality
  as effect to cause. Human knowledge was immediately and mainly\n                    of
  sense qualities, indirectly and inferen-\n                        tially of the
  scientifically designated causes. Knowledge by\n                    acquaintance
  and knowledge by description (a dis-\n                        tinction first made
  by William James in Principles\n                        of Psychology, New York
  [1890], I, 221) was Russell's way of\n                    formulating the epistemic
  access we have to ap-\n                        pearances and reality. The transitions
  and develop- ments of dualism and phenomenalism of previous cen- turies now reappeared
  (almost as Hegel's\n                    dialectic predicted) in the new but transformed
  garbs of New Realism,\n                    Critical Realism, and Common Sense Direct
  Realism. These have been almost\n                    exclusively English\n                     and
  American formulations, debates still not com- pleted. (See R. J. Hirst's The Problems\n
  \                       of Perception for a good summary and discussion of many
  of\n                    these issues.)Continental metaphysical concerns during the
  twentieth century have stayed\n                    strictly within the Kantian and
  Hegelian tradition. Edmund Husserl's\n                    phenomenology became the
  dominant mode. Two fea-\n                    tures characterize Husserl's philosophy:
  a method of analysis and a\n                    new ontology of meaning. The meta-
  physical\n                    dictum here is “the world is my world,” the world
  of\n                    lived, human experience. The whole realm of experience becomes
  a field for\n                    analysis, everything now becomes phenomena. Perhaps
  more stress has\n                    been placed by Husserl's followers upon the
  method of\n                    analysis—supposedly unbiased and free from all ontological\n
  \                   prejudices—than upon the ontology. Ques-\n                        tions
  of reality are supposed to be set aside as useless,\n                    attention
  is then free to look to the descriptions of all and any\n                    phenomena.
  But there is a metaphysic here all the same, a metaphysic of\n                    experience
  which is clearly Kantian and Hegelian. Since the stress is\n                    upon
  experience as lived and interpreted by men, meaning becomes the\n                    central
  concept, meaning for me. The union of reality in and for itself\n                        (en-soi
  et pour-soi), upon which the\n                    phenomenological metaphysic of
  ex- perience\n                    rests, has been reformulated by Sartre inBeing
  and Nothingness (L'Etre et le\n                        néant, 1943). That union
  is possible only because\n                    man is the center of this world.Sartre
  and other existentialist writers, in their liter- ary productions, seized upon the
  emotions of man as\n                    the most significant definers of reality:
  anguish, dread, loneliness. The\n                    reality of a life can be experienced
  best, they believe, in confrontations\n                    with death, fear, and
  dread—a far cry from the tranquility and\n                    peace of Wordsworth's
  real world. Husserl's phenomenology has had\n                    widespread impact
  upon literature, psychology, psychoanalysis, religion,\n                    and
  philosophy, even upon social science and education. Moreover, that\n                    impact
  has finally been felt in the English-speaking world. But the\n                    existentialist
  writers—and the art of the absurd in\n                    general—have narrowed
  the scope of reality so much that some of\n                    them are close to
  denying all reality. “Authentic”\n                    experience is privileged and
  rare, perhaps impossible; reality as meaning\n                    for a person may
  be slipping from our grasp: such seems to be the\n                    message of
  much of existentialist writing. They are close to\n                    presenting
  us with the negation of the romantic striving for and belief in\n                    a
  new and better reality in or behind appearances. Samuel Beckett's\n                    noncharacters
  find no meaning and very little reality in their experience.\n                    It
  makes little difference whether Godot is given a reli- gious interpretation, or
  whether it is secularized andIt is difficult to predict the future of this idea
  of appearance and\n                    reality. Its apotheosis in metaphysics and
  literature has had a parallel in\n                    religion and theol- ogy: the
  transcendence of\n                    God has struggled with the meaningful immanence
  of human life. In many\n                    modern theologies, religious meaning
  seems to have followed the\n                    direction of existentialist writers,
  being located in personal attitudes\n                    towards man and the world.
  The metaphysic of transcendent entities thus\n                    seems on all fronts
  to have given way to the phenomenological\n                    categories: reality
  is as it is interpreted as being in human experience.\n                    What
  there is has become a func- tion of what\n                    man finds meaningful
  and valuable in his experience. Parmenides denied\n                    reality to
  appearances. Our contemporaries are close to denying reality\n                    to
  reality. Such an ultimate denial would be the complete reversal of\n                    the
  appearance-reality distinction.F. H. Bradley, Appearance and Reality, A Metaphysical\n
