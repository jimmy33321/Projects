  tapes a segment for Miami Television News on the campus of Miami University, in
  Oxford, Ohio. (AP Photo/Gary Landers, File)\n"
- "\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"
- "\t\t\t\t\t\n"
- "\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"
- "\t\t\t\t\tCINCINNATI –  Pete Rose's application for reinstatement to baseball was
  rejected Monday by Commissioner Rob Manfred, who concluded the career hits leader
  continued to gamble even while trying to end his lifetime ban and would be a risk
  to the sport's integrity if allowed back in the game. \n"
- "Rose agreed to the ban in August 1989 after an investigation for Major League Baseball
  by lawyer John Dowd found Rose placed numerous bets on the Cincinnati Reds to win
  from 1985-87 while playing for and managing the team. \n"
- "In one of his first major actions, Manfred said in a four-page decision the career
  hits leader admitted he has kept on betting legally on horse racing and professional
  sports, including baseball. Manfred upheld the conclusions of the Dowd report and
  said MLB obtained additional evidence not available to Dowd: a notebook of betting
  records from 1986 kept by Rose associate Michael Bertolini. \n"
- "\"In short, Mr. Rose has not presented credible evidence of a reconfigured life
  either by an honest acceptance by him of his wrongdoing, so clearly established
  in the Dowd Report, or by a rigorous, self-aware and sustained program of avoidance
  by him of all the circumstances that led to his permanent in eligibility in 1989,\"
  Manfred wrote. \n"
- |
  Manfred also said Rose has never "seriously sought treatment" for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Oppositional Defiant Behavior, conditions he said in his 2004 book had afflicted him.
- " \n"
- "\"Mr. Rose's public and private comments, including his initial admission in 2004,
  provide me with little confidence that he has a mature understanding of his wrongful
  conduct, that he has accepted full responsibility for it, or that he understands
  the damage he has caused,\" Manfred wrote. \"I am also not convinced that he has
  avoided the type of conduct and associations that originally led to his placement
  on the permanently ineligible list.\" \n"
- "Rose's lawyers said he will comment on the decision at a news conference Tuesday.
  \n"
- "\"While we may have failed at our task of presenting all of the facts to the commissioner
  demonstrating how Pete has grown and changed over the past three decades, Pete has
  meaningfully reconfigured his life,\" Rose's lawyers, Ray Genco and Mark Rosenbaum,
  said in a statement. \n"
- "\"Pete's fall from grace is without parallel, but he recognizes that it was also
  of his own making,\" they said. \"As such, Pete seeks to be judged not just by the
  mistakes of his past, but also by the work he has done over the last three decades
  to take responsibility for his actions.\" \n"
- "Manfred said when he met with the 74-year-old Rose, the 17-time All-Star at first
  was not forthcoming about his current gambling. \n"
- "\"Rose initially denied betting on baseball currently and only later in the interview
  did he 'clarify' his response to admit such betting,\" Manfred wrote. \n"
- "Rose's conduct violated Major League Rule 21, which calls for a lifetime ban for
  betting on any game \"with which the bettor has a duty to perform.\" \n"
- "\"Allowing him to work in the game presents unacceptable risk of a future violation
  by him of Rule 21, and thus to the integrity of our sport,\" Manfred wrote. \n"
- "The ban prevents Rose from working for any major league team or minor league affiliate,
  but he is allowed to make ceremonial appearances with the commissioner's permission
  and may work for third parties such as Fox, which hired Rose this year as a baseball
  analyst. \n"
- "Players on the permanently ineligible list also may not appear on the Hall of Fame
  ballot, a decision taken by the Hall's board in 1991. Reds President Bob Castellini
  said he hopes the Hall will reconsider its decision. \n"
- "\"We and the fans think he deserves that opportunity,\" he said. \n"
- "At the time the ban agreement was announced, then-Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti
  said: \"The burden is entirely on Mr. Rose to reconfigure his life in a way he deems
  appropriate.\" \n"
- "Rose applied for reinstatement in September 1997 and met with Commissioner Bud
  Selig in November 2002, but Selig never ruled on Rose's application. Manfred succeeded
  Selig in January, and Rose applied again on Feb. 26 to end the ban. He met with
  Manfred on Sept. 24. \n"
- "\"It was great opinion,\" Dowd said. \"I'm proud of the commissioner for protecting
  the integrity of the game.\" \n"
- "Manfred called former Commissioner Fay Vincent on Monday to inform him of the decision.
  Vincent was Giamatti's deputy and hired Dowd, then became commissioner following
  Giamatti's death on Sept. 1, 1989. \n"
- "\"I think he is a tragic figure,\" Vincent said. \"He believed he was a great ballplayer,
  that he could do anything he wanted and that baseball would never have the guts
  to throw him out.\" \n"
- "Vincent called Rose's initial denial of current gambling \"bizarre.\" \n"
- "\"He lied about betting on baseball right in the commissioner's office,\" Dowd
  said. \n"
- "Rose repeatedly denied betting on baseball until in his 2004 autobiography, \"Pete
  Rose: My Prison Without Bars.\" He reversed his stand and acknowledged he bet on
  the Reds while managing Cincinnati. Manfred said that while Rose admitted to him
  betting on Reds' game in 1987, he didn't remember facts established by the Dowd
  report showing he bet on baseball in 1985 and 1986 as a player. \n"
- "Rose submitted two reports to Manfred, one by Dr. Timothy Fong, co-director of
  the UCLA Gambling Studies Program and director of the UCLA Addiction Psychiatry
  Fellowship. Manfred said he gave the report little weight because it was inconsistent
  with what Manfred told him. \n"
- "The second report was a polygraph test taken on Aug. 5 by a consultant retained
  by Rose's representatives. Manfred wrote the polygraph test concluded \"no opinion\"
  based on technical reasons that were not Rose's responsibility. \n"
- |
  Rose was the 1963 NL Rookie of the Year, 1973 MVP and 1975 World Series MVP. A three-time NL batting champion, he had 4,256 hits from 1963-86, topping the mark of 4,191 set by Ty Cobb from 1905-28.

- 'Sign in to comment!Sept. 21, 2015: Former Cincinnati Reds player and manager Pete
  Rose tapes a segment for Miami Television News on the campus of Miami University,
  in Oxford, Ohio. (AP Photo/Gary Landers, File)CINCINNATI –  Pete Rose''s application
  for reinstatement to baseball was rejected Monday by Commissioner Rob Manfred, who
  concluded the career hits leader continued to gamble even while trying to end his
  lifetime ban and would be a risk to the sport''s integrity if allowed back in the
  game.Rose agreed to the ban in August 1989 after an investigation for Major League
  Baseball by lawyer John Dowd found Rose placed numerous bets on the Cincinnati Reds
  to win from 1985-87 while playing for and managing the team.In one of his first
  major actions, Manfred said in a four-page decision the career hits leader admitted
  he has kept on betting legally on horse racing and professional sports, including
  baseball. Manfred upheld the conclusions of the Dowd report and said MLB obtained
  additional evidence not available to Dowd: a notebook of betting records from 1986
  kept by Rose associate Michael Bertolini."In short, Mr. Rose has not presented credible
  evidence of a reconfigured life either by an honest acceptance by him of his wrongdoing,
  so clearly established in the Dowd Report, or by a rigorous, self-aware and sustained
  program of avoidance by him of all the circumstances that led to his permanent in
  eligibility in 1989," Manfred wrote.Manfred also said Rose has never "seriously
  sought treatment" for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Oppositional
  Defiant Behavior, conditions he said in his 2004 book had afflicted him."Mr. Rose''s
  public and private comments, including his initial admission in 2004, provide me
  with little confidence that he has a mature understanding of his wrongful conduct,
  that he has accepted full responsibility for it, or that he understands the damage
  he has caused," Manfred wrote. "I am also not convinced that he has avoided the
  type of conduct and associations that originally led to his placement on the permanently
  ineligible list."Rose''s lawyers said he will comment on the decision at a news
  conference Tuesday."While we may have failed at our task of presenting all of the
  facts to the commissioner demonstrating how Pete has grown and changed over the
  past three decades, Pete has meaningfully reconfigured his life," Rose''s lawyers,
  Ray Genco and Mark Rosenbaum, said in a statement."Pete''s fall from grace is without
  parallel, but he recognizes that it was also of his own making," they said. "As
  such, Pete seeks to be judged not just by the mistakes of his past, but also by
  the work he has done over the last three decades to take responsibility for his
  actions."Manfred said when he met with the 74-year-old Rose, the 17-time All-Star
  at first was not forthcoming about his current gambling."Rose initially denied betting
  on baseball currently and only later in the interview did he ''clarify'' his response
  to admit such betting," Manfred wrote.Rose''s conduct violated Major League Rule
  21, which calls for a lifetime ban for betting on any game "with which the bettor
  has a duty to perform.""Allowing him to work in the game presents unacceptable risk
  of a future violation by him of Rule 21, and thus to the integrity of our sport,"
  Manfred wrote.The ban prevents Rose from working for any major league team or minor
  league affiliate, but he is allowed to make ceremonial appearances with the commissioner''s
  permission and may work for third parties such as Fox, which hired Rose this year
  as a baseball analyst.Players on the permanently ineligible list also may not appear
  on the Hall of Fame ballot, a decision taken by the Hall''s board in 1991. Reds
  President Bob Castellini said he hopes the Hall will reconsider its decision."We
  and the fans think he deserves that opportunity," he said.At the time the ban agreement
  was announced, then-Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti said: "The burden is entirely
  on Mr. Rose to reconfigure his life in a way he deems appropriate."Rose applied
  for reinstatement in September 1997 and met with Commissioner Bud Selig in November
  2002, but Selig never ruled on Rose''s application. Manfred succeeded Selig in January,
  and Rose applied again on Feb. 26 to end the ban. He met with Manfred on Sept. 24."It
  was great opinion," Dowd said. "I''m proud of the commissioner for protecting the
  integrity of the game."Manfred called former Commissioner Fay Vincent on Monday
  to inform him of the decision. Vincent was Giamatti''s deputy and hired Dowd, then
  became commissioner following Giamatti''s death on Sept. 1, 1989."I think he is
  a tragic figure," Vincent said. "He believed he was a great ballplayer, that he
  could do anything he wanted and that baseball would never have the guts to throw
  him out."Vincent called Rose''s initial denial of current gambling "bizarre.""He
  lied about betting on baseball right in the commissioner''s office," Dowd said.Rose
  repeatedly denied betting on baseball until in his 2004 autobiography, "Pete Rose:
  My Prison Without Bars." He reversed his stand and acknowledged he bet on the Reds
  while managing Cincinnati. Manfred said that while Rose admitted to him betting
  on Reds'' game in 1987, he didn''t remember facts established by the Dowd report
  showing he bet on baseball in 1985 and 1986 as a player.Rose submitted two reports
  to Manfred, one by Dr. Timothy Fong, co-director of the UCLA Gambling Studies Program
  and director of the UCLA Addiction Psychiatry Fellowship. Manfred said he gave the
  report little weight because it was inconsistent with what Manfred told him.The
  second report was a polygraph test taken on Aug. 5 by a consultant retained by Rose''s
  representatives. Manfred wrote the polygraph test concluded "no opinion" based on
  technical reasons that were not Rose''s responsibility.Rose was the 1963 NL Rookie
  of the Year, 1973 MVP and 1975 World Series MVP. A three-time NL batting champion,
  he had 4,256 hits from 1963-86, topping the mark of 4,191 set by Ty Cobb from 1905-28.AdvertisementAdvertisementThis

  Landers, File)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCINCINNATI –  Pete
  Rose's application for reinstatement to baseball was rejected Monday by Commissioner
  Rob Manfred, who concluded the career hits leader continued to gamble even while
  trying to end his lifetime ban and would be a risk to the sport's integrity if allowed
  back in the game. \nRose agreed to the ban in August 1989 after an investigation
  for Major League Baseball by lawyer John Dowd found Rose placed numerous bets on
  the Cincinnati Reds to win from 1985-87 while playing for and managing the team.
  \nIn one of his first major actions, Manfred said in a four-page decision the career
  hits leader admitted he has kept on betting legally on horse racing and professional
  sports, including baseball. Manfred upheld the conclusions of the Dowd report and
  said MLB obtained additional evidence not available to Dowd: a notebook of betting
  records from 1986 kept by Rose associate Michael Bertolini. \n\"In short, Mr. Rose
  has not presented credible evidence of a reconfigured life either by an honest acceptance
  by him of his wrongdoing, so clearly established in the Dowd Report, or by a rigorous,
  self-aware and sustained program of avoidance by him of all the circumstances that
  led to his permanent in eligibility in 1989,\" Manfred wrote. \nManfred also said
  Rose has never \"seriously sought treatment\" for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
  Disorder and Oppositional Defiant Behavior, conditions he said in his 2004 book
  had afflicted him.\n \n\"Mr. Rose's public and private comments, including his initial
  admission in 2004, provide me with little confidence that he has a mature understanding
  of his wrongful conduct, that he has accepted full responsibility for it, or that
  he understands the damage he has caused,\" Manfred wrote. \"I am also not convinced
  that he has avoided the type of conduct and associations that originally led to
  his placement on the permanently ineligible list.\" \nRose's lawyers said he will
  comment on the decision at a news conference Tuesday. \n\"While we may have failed
  at our task of presenting all of the facts to the commissioner demonstrating how
  Pete has grown and changed over the past three decades, Pete has meaningfully reconfigured
  his life,\" Rose's lawyers, Ray Genco and Mark Rosenbaum, said in a statement. \n\"Pete's
  fall from grace is without parallel, but he recognizes that it was also of his own
  making,\" they said. \"As such, Pete seeks to be judged not just by the mistakes
  of his past, but also by the work he has done over the last three decades to take
  responsibility for his actions.\" \nManfred said when he met with the 74-year-old
  Rose, the 17-time All-Star at first was not forthcoming about his current gambling.
  \n\"Rose initially denied betting on baseball currently and only later in the interview
  did he 'clarify' his response to admit such betting,\" Manfred wrote. \nRose's conduct
  violated Major League Rule 21, which calls for a lifetime ban for betting on any
  game \"with which the bettor has a duty to perform.\" \n\"Allowing him to work in
  the game presents unacceptable risk of a future violation by him of Rule 21, and
  thus to the integrity of our sport,\" Manfred wrote. \nThe ban prevents Rose from
  working for any major league team or minor league affiliate, but he is allowed to
  make ceremonial appearances with the commissioner's permission and may work for
  third parties such as Fox, which hired Rose this year as a baseball analyst. \nPlayers
  on the permanently ineligible list also may not appear on the Hall of Fame ballot,
  a decision taken by the Hall's board in 1991. Reds President Bob Castellini said
  he hopes the Hall will reconsider its decision. \n\"We and the fans think he deserves
  that opportunity,\" he said. \nAt the time the ban agreement was announced, then-Commissioner
  A. Bartlett Giamatti said: \"The burden is entirely on Mr. Rose to reconfigure his
  life in a way he deems appropriate.\" \nRose applied for reinstatement in September
  1997 and met with Commissioner Bud Selig in November 2002, but Selig never ruled
  on Rose's application. Manfred succeeded Selig in January, and Rose applied again
  on Feb. 26 to end the ban. He met with Manfred on Sept. 24. \n\"It was great opinion,\"
  Dowd said. \"I'm proud of the commissioner for protecting the integrity of the game.\"
  \nManfred called former Commissioner Fay Vincent on Monday to inform him of the
  decision. Vincent was Giamatti's deputy and hired Dowd, then became commissioner
  following Giamatti's death on Sept. 1, 1989. \n\"I think he is a tragic figure,\"
  Vincent said. \"He believed he was a great ballplayer, that he could do anything
  he wanted and that baseball would never have the guts to throw him out.\" \nVincent
  called Rose's initial denial of current gambling \"bizarre.\" \n\"He lied about
  betting on baseball right in the commissioner's office,\" Dowd said. \nRose repeatedly
  denied betting on baseball until in his 2004 autobiography, \"Pete Rose: My Prison
  Without Bars.\" He reversed his stand and acknowledged he bet on the Reds while
  managing Cincinnati. Manfred said that while Rose admitted to him betting on Reds'
  game in 1987, he didn't remember facts established by the Dowd report showing he
  bet on baseball in 1985 and 1986 as a player. \nRose submitted two reports to Manfred,
  one by Dr. Timothy Fong, co-director of the UCLA Gambling Studies Program and director
  of the UCLA Addiction Psychiatry Fellowship. Manfred said he gave the report little
  weight because it was inconsistent with what Manfred told him. \nThe second report
  was a polygraph test taken on Aug. 5 by a consultant retained by Rose's representatives.
  Manfred wrote the polygraph test concluded \"no opinion\" based on technical reasons
  that were not Rose's responsibility. \nRose was the 1963 NL Rookie of the Year,
  1973 MVP and 1975 World Series MVP. A three-time NL batting champion, he had 4,256
  hits from 1963-86, topping the mark of 4,191 set by Ty Cobb from 1905-28.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n

  –  Pete Rose's application for reinstatement to baseball was rejected Monday by
  Commissioner Rob Manfred, who concluded the career hits leader continued to gamble
  even while trying to end his lifetime ban and would be a risk to the sport's integrity
  if allowed back in the game.Rose agreed to the ban in August 1989 after an investigation
  for Major League Baseball by lawyer John Dowd found Rose placed numerous bets on
  the Cincinnati Reds to win from 1985-87 while playing for and managing the team.In
  one of his first major actions, Manfred said in a four-page decision the career
  hits leader admitted he has kept on betting legally on horse racing and professional
  sports, including baseball. Manfred upheld the conclusions of the Dowd report and
  said MLB obtained additional evidence not available to Dowd: a notebook of betting
  records from 1986 kept by Rose associate Michael Bertolini.\"In short, Mr. Rose
  has not presented credible evidence of a reconfigured life either by an honest acceptance
  by him of his wrongdoing, so clearly established in the Dowd Report, or by a rigorous,
  self-aware and sustained program of avoidance by him of all the circumstances that
  led to his permanent in eligibility in 1989,\" Manfred wrote.Manfred also said Rose
  has never \"seriously sought treatment\" for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
  and Oppositional Defiant Behavior, conditions he said in his 2004 book had afflicted
  him.\"Mr. Rose's public and private comments, including his initial admission in
  2004, provide me with little confidence that he has a mature understanding of his
  wrongful conduct, that he has accepted full responsibility for it, or that he understands
  the damage he has caused,\" Manfred wrote. \"I am also not convinced that he has
  avoided the type of conduct and associations that originally led to his placement
  on the permanently ineligible list.\"Rose's lawyers said he will comment on the
  decision at a news conference Tuesday.\"While we may have failed at our task of
  presenting all of the facts to the commissioner demonstrating how Pete has grown
  and changed over the past three decades, Pete has meaningfully reconfigured his
  life,\" Rose's lawyers, Ray Genco and Mark Rosenbaum, said in a statement.\"Pete's
  fall from grace is without parallel, but he recognizes that it was also of his own
  making,\" they said. \"As such, Pete seeks to be judged not just by the mistakes
  of his past, but also by the work he has done over the last three decades to take
  responsibility for his actions.\"Manfred said when he met with the 74-year-old Rose,
  the 17-time All-Star at first was not forthcoming about his current gambling.\"Rose
  initially denied betting on baseball currently and only later in the interview did
  he 'clarify' his response to admit such betting,\" Manfred wrote.Rose's conduct
  violated Major League Rule 21, which calls for a lifetime ban for betting on any
  game \"with which the bettor has a duty to perform.\"\"Allowing him to work in the
  game presents unacceptable risk of a future violation by him of Rule 21, and thus
  to the integrity of our sport,\" Manfred wrote.The ban prevents Rose from working
  for any major league team or minor league affiliate, but he is allowed to make ceremonial
  appearances with the commissioner's permission and may work for third parties such
  as Fox, which hired Rose this year as a baseball analyst.Players on the permanently
  ineligible list also may not appear on the Hall of Fame ballot, a decision taken
  by the Hall's board in 1991. Reds President Bob Castellini said he hopes the Hall
  will reconsider its decision.\"We and the fans think he deserves that opportunity,\"
  he said.At the time the ban agreement was announced, then-Commissioner A. Bartlett
  Giamatti said: \"The burden is entirely on Mr. Rose to reconfigure his life in a
  way he deems appropriate.\"Rose applied for reinstatement in September 1997 and
  met with Commissioner Bud Selig in November 2002, but Selig never ruled on Rose's
  application. Manfred succeeded Selig in January, and Rose applied again on Feb.
  26 to end the ban. He met with Manfred on Sept. 24.\"It was great opinion,\" Dowd
  said. \"I'm proud of the commissioner for protecting the integrity of the game.\"Manfred
  called former Commissioner Fay Vincent on Monday to inform him of the decision.
  Vincent was Giamatti's deputy and hired Dowd, then became commissioner following
  Giamatti's death on Sept. 1, 1989.\"I think he is a tragic figure,\" Vincent said.
  \"He believed he was a great ballplayer, that he could do anything he wanted and
  that baseball would never have the guts to throw him out.\"Vincent called Rose's
  initial denial of current gambling \"bizarre.\"\"He lied about betting on baseball
  right in the commissioner's office,\" Dowd said.Rose repeatedly denied betting on
  baseball until in his 2004 autobiography, \"Pete Rose: My Prison Without Bars.\"
  He reversed his stand and acknowledged he bet on the Reds while managing Cincinnati.
  Manfred said that while Rose admitted to him betting on Reds' game in 1987, he didn't
  remember facts established by the Dowd report showing he bet on baseball in 1985
  and 1986 as a player.Rose submitted two reports to Manfred, one by Dr. Timothy Fong,
  co-director of the UCLA Gambling Studies Program and director of the UCLA Addiction
  Psychiatry Fellowship. Manfred said he gave the report little weight because it
  was inconsistent with what Manfred told him.The second report was a polygraph test
  taken on Aug. 5 by a consultant retained by Rose's representatives. Manfred wrote
  the polygraph test concluded \"no opinion\" based on technical reasons that were
  not Rose's responsibility.Rose was the 1963 NL Rookie of the Year, 1973 MVP and
  1975 World Series MVP. A three-time NL batting champion, he had 4,256 hits from
  1963-86, topping the mark of 4,191 set by Ty Cobb from 1905-28.AdvertisementAdvertisementThis
