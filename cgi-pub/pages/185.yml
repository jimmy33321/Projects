  Mathematics illuminates the patterns and structures all around us. Our dynamic exhibits, gallery, and programs will stimulate inquiry, spark curiosity, and reveal the wonders of mathematics. MoMath has innovative exhibits that will engage folks from 105 to 5 years old (and sometimes younger), but with a special emphasis on activities for 4th through 8th graders.
- |
  The Museum is located at 11 East 26th Street in Manhattan and is open from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm, seven days a week, 364 days a year (MoMath is closed on Thanksgiving Day). Special note: MoMath closes early the first Wednesday of every month, at 2:30 PM.
