- "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEvery dollar that you save and invest is a
  dollar that’s working for your future. Well, almost a dollar.After you take into
  account commissions, management costs and cryptic sounding stuff like 12b-1 fees,
  every dollar that you save and invest is more like 98 cents working for your future.
  A couple of pennies falling through the cracks may not sound like much, but remember:
  Every penny you sacrifice in fees is a penny that’s not able to compound and grow
  over time. Let’s say you invest $25,000, earn a 7% average annual return on your
  investment, and pay a reasonable 0.5% in fees. After 35 years that pile of pennies
  will be worth $227,000.Now, what happens if instead of 0.5% in fees, you pay 1.5%
  -- a mere percentage point more? Say Sayonara to $64,000. That’s how much fees stunt
  the growth of your portfolio over time. And in this scenario paying 1.5% on your
  $25,000 investment gets you only $163,000 after 35 years. When it comes to fees,
  compounding is working against you: Instead small amounts of money growing over
  time in your favor, it’s small fees compounding into massive costs. (Just in case
  you need a little more convincing: Are You Using Compound Interest For Good or Evil?)\n"
- "\t\t\t\t\t\tKeep An Eye Out for Fee CreepIdeally, investing fees should gobble
  up no more than 1% of your overall portfolio value. These days with so many low-cost
  investing options, that’s an easy guideline to stick to -- at least you’d think
  it would be.When it comes to managing money, everyone wants a piece of the action
  -- brokerages, fund companies, retirement plan administrators, advisors, planners,
  Uncle Sam. Investors need to guard the most vulnerable areas of their portfolio
  from being attacked by a fee feeding frenzy. (How much are you paying in fees? Find
  out with a free portfolio analysis.) Make sure all of your dollars are building
  your wealth by keeping a close eye on these six costs. \n"
- "\t\t\t\t\t\t1. Workplace Retirement Plan Fees: Employer-sponsored retirement plans
  (401(k)s, 403(b)s) have a lot going for them, including tax-saving features, automated
  investing, and potentially a company match on a portion of what you invest. Of course,
  setting up and providing ongoing administrative support isn’t free. And the fund
  companies within the plan want their cut, too.On average, 401(k) fees range from
  1% to 2% [AmericanProgress.org: http://ampr.gs/1PpWRnt]. And who picks up the tab?
  In most cases those costs are passed right along to you and other participants in
  the plan. While even a mere 1% might not sound like much, when that amount is skimmed
  off the top of your ever-growing account, the financial blow packs a massive wallop
  -- especially in these accounts where the bulk of most people’s retirement money
  is saved.\n"
- "\t\t\t\t\t\t2. Trading Commissions:When it comes to taking investing into your
  own hands, basic administrative fees such as trading commissions are one of the
  easiest fees to spot before things get out of hand.If you invest in individual stocks
  or buy mutual funds through a brokerage, you can check the cost of trading (buying
  and selling) by looking at the brokerage’s fee schedule. Many brokerages charge
  a flat fee to place an order (e.g. $4 to $10 for stock trades; $20 to $50 or more
  to buy a mutual fund (unless the fund company is part of the broker’s network).
  But fees for things like options trading, broker-assisted trades, REITs and other
  types of investments can be much more. And don’t forget about other costs you may
  have to cover -- transfer fees, account closing fees, and extra costs if you want
  to have a human being make your trade. That said, even if you only have a small
  amount to invest, don’t let the cost of a few brokerage commissions thwart you.
  Get that money to work for your future ASAP. (See: Here’s Why You Should Start Investing
  Now.)\n"
- "\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Mutual Fund Management FeesThe administrative costs of investing
  in stocks via a brokerage pale in comparison to the charges generated within actual
  investment products, especially mutual funds.It’s not cheap to assemble, market,
  manage and administer a mutual fund. There are fund manager and staff salaries to
  pay, slick commercials and marketing materials to produce, and thousands of trades
  (and associated commissions) to make within the fund. The sum of these costs is
  expressed as a fund’s expense ratio. You won’t find the expense ratio itemized on
  your account statement: You have to look it up on the mutual fund’s prospectus (or
  on a site like Morningstar.com). After you find the number, you can probably guess
  who pays the tab -- yup, that investor whose mug you’re staring at in the reflection
  of your computer screen. Fund fees are deducted automatically from the mutual fund
  which, of course, reduces the fund’s overall returns -- your returns.fee study by
  mutual fund tracker Morningstar. Remember, that’s 1.19% in returns that the mutual
  fund pockets, not you. [Morningstar: http://bit.ly/1jkB051]FutureAdvisor actively
  avoids investments with excessive fees, and uses index mutual funds, ETFs or other
  financial instruments with very low expense ratios -- typically 0.025% to 0.15%
  of the amount you invest. \n"
- "\t\t\t\t\t\t4. Bid-Ask Spread: Besides commissions, investors also pay what’s called
  a “spread” when they buy or sell stocks or mutual funds. This cost is one that is
  often overlooked by investors -- but it should definitely be on your radar. When
  you look up the price of a fund or stock and you see it’s $20 per share (that’s
  the “bid”). But the price you have to pay if you want to buy the share (the “ask”)
  is always a little higher (say, $20.50, in our example). The difference between
  the two is the bid-ask spread and every buyer -- including giant mutual funds --
  must pay it.Given the size and number of the trades mutual funds make, the bid-ask
  spread may result in additional costs for mutual fund shareholders. These costs
  may be minimized by avoiding funds with a high-turnover rate (a.k.a. heavy trading
  activity) which may generate higher total trading costs. \n"
- "\t\t\t\t\t\t5. Liquidity Costs:You’ve heard of a “buyer’s market” or a “seller’s
  market” referring to real estate. The same concept is at play in the stock market,
  too. Investors can only buy or sell a stock or mutual fund if someone else is willing
  to sell or buy their shares. So when a fund has low liquidity -- also called low
  trading volume because there’s not a lot of buying and selling going on -- investors
  have a harder time fulfilling their trades in a timely and cost-effective manner.
  If a fund’s price drops and a lot of investors decide to withdraw their money at
  once, those who weren’t able to get out early are going to be left trying to sell
  shares at fire-sale prices.Typically you’ll see low liquidity in newer funds and
  ones that don’t have a lot of assets under management. It behooves investors to
  check a fund’s liquidity because it has a direct effect on the bid-ask spread and
  can make it expensive to build a portfolio. At FutureAdvisor we only select funds
  that have been around for a sufficient amount of time and have significant assets
  in the funds and good daily trading volume (high liquidity). \n"
- "\t\t\t\t\t\t6. Tax Cost Ratio: Lastly, we end with a word about taxes. Obviously,
  you want to keep tax costs down as much as possible. But in some situations you
  have little control. When a mutual fund distributes dividends (from stocks or bonds
  within the fund), and capital gains to shareholders, that counts as income and gets
  Uncle Sam’s attention. It doesn’t matter if the distributions are paid out in cash
  or reinvested to purchase additional shares: Investors are required to pay taxes
  on that income for the year in which it was received. The “tax cost ratio” can vary
  depending on how much buying and selling is done within the fund. According to Morningstar,
  fund tax cost ratios fall somewhere between 0 (the fund generated no taxable distributions)
  and 5 (indicating a less tax-efficient fund).  Each percent you pay in taxes lowers
  your return on an after-tax basis. (Note: If you hold the fund in a tax-deferred
  account (like a 401(k) or Traditional IRA), you’re off the hook for taxes until
  you start making withdrawals.) [Morningstar: http://bit.ly/1G1r5ey]It behooves investors
  who are considering buying or selling in a taxable account to beware of funds that
  have a high turnover rate (generating more frequent taxable events). Also, watch
  your timing: Avoid buying a fund right before it pays out a distribution (which
  typically occurs at the end of the year). Otherwise you’ll end up buying yourself
  a tax bill on investments that you didn’t even get the chance to profit from.  \n"

- "\tWhen it comes to managing your money, everyone wants a piece of the action --
  brokerages, fund companies, retirement plan administrators, advisors, planners,
  and, of course, Uncle Sam.AuthorAfter you take into account commissions, management
  costs and cryptic sounding stuff like 12b-1 fees, every dollar that you save and
  invest is more like 98 cents working for your future. A couple of pennies falling
  through the cracks may not sound like much, but remember: Every penny you sacrifice
  in fees is a penny that’s not able to compound and grow over time. When it comes
  to fees, compounding is working against you: Instead small amounts of money growing
  over time in your favor, it’s small fees compounding into massive costs. (Just in
  case you need a little more convincing: Are You Using Compound Interest For Good
  or Evil?)Ideally, investing fees should gobble up no more than 1% of your overall
  portfolio value. These days with so many low-cost investing options, that’s an easy
  guideline to stick to -- at least you’d think it would be.When it comes to managing
  money, everyone wants a piece of the action -- brokerages, fund companies, retirement
  plan administrators, advisors, planners, Uncle Sam. Investors need to guard the
  most vulnerable areas of their portfolio from being attacked by a fee feeding frenzy.
  (How much are you paying in fees? Find out with a free portfolio analysis.) Make
  sure all of your dollars are building your wealth by keeping a close eye on these
  six costs. Employer-sponsored retirement plans (401(k)s, 403(b)s) have a lot going
  for them, including tax-saving features, automated investing, and potentially a
  company match on a portion of what you invest. Of course, setting up and providing
  ongoing administrative support isn’t free. And the fund companies within the plan
  want their cut, too.On average, 401(k) fees range from 1% to 2% [AmericanProgress.org:
  http://ampr.gs/1PpWRnt]. And who picks up the tab? In most cases those costs are
  passed right along to you and other participants in the plan. While even a mere
  1% might not sound like much, when that amount is skimmed off the top of your ever-growing
  account, the financial blow packs a massive wallop -- especially in these accounts
  where the bulk of most people’s retirement money is saved.When it comes to taking
  investing into your own hands, basic administrative fees such as trading commissions
  are one of the easiest fees to spot before things get out of hand.If you invest
  in individual stocks or buy mutual funds through a brokerage, you can check the
  cost of trading (buying and selling) by looking at the brokerage’s fee schedule.
  Many brokerages charge a flat fee to place an order (e.g. $4 to $10 for stock trades;
  $20 to $50 or more to buy a mutual fund (unless the fund company is part of the
  broker’s network). But fees for things like options trading, broker-assisted trades,
  REITs and other types of investments can be much more. And don’t forget about other
  costs you may have to cover -- transfer fees, account closing fees, and extra costs
  if you want to have a human being make your trade. That said, even if you only have
  a small amount to invest, don’t let the cost of a few brokerage commissions thwart
  you. Get that money to work for your future ASAP. (See: Here’s Why You Should Start
  Investing Now.)The administrative costs of investing in stocks via a brokerage pale
  in comparison to the charges generated within actual investment products, especially
  mutual funds.It’s not cheap to assemble, market, manage and administer a mutual
  fund. There are fund manager and staff salaries to pay, slick commercials and marketing
  materials to produce, and thousands of trades (and associated commissions) to make
  within the fund. The sum of these costs is expressed as a fund’s expense ratio.
  You won’t find the expense ratio itemized on your account statement: You have to
  look it up on the mutual fund’s prospectus (or on a site like Morningstar.com).
  After you find the number, you can probably guess who pays the tab -- yup, that
  investor whose mug you’re staring at in the reflection of your computer screen.
  Fund fees are deducted automatically from the mutual fund which, of course, reduces
  the fund’s overall returns -- your returns.fee study by mutual fund tracker Morningstar.
  Remember, that’s 1.19% in returns that the mutual fund pockets, not you. [Morningstar:
  http://bit.ly/1jkB051]FutureAdvisor actively avoids investments with excessive fees,
  and uses index mutual funds, ETFs or other financial instruments with very low expense
  ratios -- typically 0.025% to 0.15% of the amount you invest. Besides commissions,
  investors also pay what’s called a “spread” when they buy or sell stocks or mutual
  funds. This cost is one that is often overlooked by investors -- but it should definitely
  be on your radar. When you look up the price of a fund or stock and you see it’s
  $20 per share (that’s the “bid”). But the price you have to pay if you want to buy
  the share (the “ask”) is always a little higher (say, $20.50, in our example). The
  difference between the two is the bid-ask spread and every buyer -- including giant
  mutual funds -- must pay it.Given the size and number of the trades mutual funds
  make, the bid-ask spread may result in additional costs for mutual fund shareholders.
  These costs may be minimized by avoiding funds with a high-turnover rate (a.k.a.
  heavy trading activity) which may generate higher total trading costs. You’ve heard
  of a “buyer’s market” or a “seller’s market” referring to real estate. The same
  concept is at play in the stock market, too. Investors can only buy or sell a stock
  or mutual fund if someone else is willing to sell or buy their shares. So when a
  fund has low liquidity -- also called low trading volume because there’s not a lot
  of buying and selling going on -- investors have a harder time fulfilling their
  trades in a timely and cost-effective manner. If a fund’s price drops and a lot
  of investors decide to withdraw their money at once, those who weren’t able to get
  out early are going to be left trying to sell shares at fire-sale prices.Typically
  you’ll see low liquidity in newer funds and ones that don’t have a lot of assets
  under management. It behooves investors to check a fund’s liquidity because it has
  a direct effect on the bid-ask spread and can make it expensive to build a portfolio.
  At FutureAdvisor we only select funds that have been around for a sufficient amount
  of time and have significant assets in the funds and good daily trading volume (high
  liquidity). Lastly, we end with a word about taxes. Obviously, you want to keep
  tax costs down as much as possible. But in some situations you have little control.
  When a mutual fund distributes dividends (from stocks or bonds within the fund),
  and capital gains to shareholders, that counts as income and gets Uncle Sam’s attention.
  It doesn’t matter if the distributions are paid out in cash or reinvested to purchase
  additional shares: Investors are required to pay taxes on that income for the year
  in which it was received. The “tax cost ratio” can vary depending on how much buying
  and selling is done within the fund. According to Morningstar, fund tax cost ratios
  fall somewhere between 0 (the fund generated no taxable distributions) and 5 (indicating
  a less tax-efficient fund).  Each percent you pay in taxes lowers your return on
  an after-tax basis. (Note: If you hold the fund in a tax-deferred account (like
  a 401(k) or Traditional IRA), you’re off the hook for taxes until you start making
  withdrawals.) [Morningstar: http://bit.ly/1G1r5ey]It behooves investors who are
  considering buying or selling in a taxable account to beware of funds that have
  a high turnover rate (generating more frequent taxable events). Also, watch your
  timing: Avoid buying a fund right before it pays out a distribution (which typically
  occurs at the end of the year). Otherwise you’ll end up buying yourself a tax bill
  on investments that you didn’t even get the chance to profit from.  Don’t spend
  one more dollar on unnecessary fees. Get a free detailed screen of your current
  investments (including the ones in your 401(k)). We’ll point out any fee funny business
  and recommend low-cost, tax-efficient, diversified mutual funds and ETFs to replace
  any fee-laden ones that you currently own.\n"

  dollar that you save and invest is a dollar that’s working for your future. Well,
  almost a dollar.After you take into account commissions, management costs and cryptic
  sounding stuff like 12b-1 fees, every dollar that you save and invest is more like
  98 cents working for your future. A couple of pennies falling through the cracks
  may not sound like much, but remember: Every penny you sacrifice in fees is a penny
  that’s not able to compound and grow over time. Let’s say you invest $25,000, earn
  a 7% average annual return on your investment, and pay a reasonable 0.5% in fees.
  After 35 years that pile of pennies will be worth $227,000.Now, what happens if
  instead of 0.5% in fees, you pay 1.5% -- a mere percentage point more? Say Sayonara
  to $64,000. That’s how much fees stunt the growth of your portfolio over time. And
  in this scenario paying 1.5% on your $25,000 investment gets you only $163,000 after
  35 years. When it comes to fees, compounding is working against you: Instead small
  amounts of money growing over time in your favor, it’s small fees compounding into
  massive costs. (Just in case you need a little more convincing: Are You Using Compound
  Interest For Good or Evil?)\n\t\t\t\t\t\tKeep An Eye Out for Fee CreepIdeally, investing
  fees should gobble up no more than 1% of your overall portfolio value. These days
  with so many low-cost investing options, that’s an easy guideline to stick to --
  at least you’d think it would be.When it comes to managing money, everyone wants
  a piece of the action -- brokerages, fund companies, retirement plan administrators,
  advisors, planners, Uncle Sam. Investors need to guard the most vulnerable areas
  of their portfolio from being attacked by a fee feeding frenzy. (How much are you
  paying in fees? Find out with a free portfolio analysis.) Make sure all of your
  dollars are building your wealth by keeping a close eye on these six costs. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t1.
  Workplace Retirement Plan Fees: Employer-sponsored retirement plans (401(k)s, 403(b)s)
  have a lot going for them, including tax-saving features, automated investing, and
  potentially a company match on a portion of what you invest. Of course, setting
  up and providing ongoing administrative support isn’t free. And the fund companies
  within the plan want their cut, too.On average, 401(k) fees range from 1% to 2%
  [AmericanProgress.org: http://ampr.gs/1PpWRnt]. And who picks up the tab? In most
  cases those costs are passed right along to you and other participants in the plan.
  While even a mere 1% might not sound like much, when that amount is skimmed off
  the top of your ever-growing account, the financial blow packs a massive wallop
  -- especially in these accounts where the bulk of most people’s retirement money
  is saved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2. Trading Commissions:When it comes to taking investing
  into your own hands, basic administrative fees such as trading commissions are one
  of the easiest fees to spot before things get out of hand.If you invest in individual
  stocks or buy mutual funds through a brokerage, you can check the cost of trading
  (buying and selling) by looking at the brokerage’s fee schedule. Many brokerages
  charge a flat fee to place an order (e.g. $4 to $10 for stock trades; $20 to $50
  or more to buy a mutual fund (unless the fund company is part of the broker’s network).
  But fees for things like options trading, broker-assisted trades, REITs and other
  types of investments can be much more. And don’t forget about other costs you may
  have to cover -- transfer fees, account closing fees, and extra costs if you want
  to have a human being make your trade. That said, even if you only have a small
  amount to invest, don’t let the cost of a few brokerage commissions thwart you.
  Get that money to work for your future ASAP. (See: Here’s Why You Should Start Investing
  Now.)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Mutual Fund Management FeesThe administrative costs of investing
  in stocks via a brokerage pale in comparison to the charges generated within actual
  investment products, especially mutual funds.It’s not cheap to assemble, market,
  manage and administer a mutual fund. There are fund manager and staff salaries to
  pay, slick commercials and marketing materials to produce, and thousands of trades
  (and associated commissions) to make within the fund. The sum of these costs is
  expressed as a fund’s expense ratio. You won’t find the expense ratio itemized on
  your account statement: You have to look it up on the mutual fund’s prospectus (or
  on a site like Morningstar.com). After you find the number, you can probably guess
  who pays the tab -- yup, that investor whose mug you’re staring at in the reflection
  of your computer screen. Fund fees are deducted automatically from the mutual fund
  which, of course, reduces the fund’s overall returns -- your returns.fee study by
  mutual fund tracker Morningstar. Remember, that’s 1.19% in returns that the mutual
  fund pockets, not you. [Morningstar: http://bit.ly/1jkB051]FutureAdvisor actively
  avoids investments with excessive fees, and uses index mutual funds, ETFs or other
  financial instruments with very low expense ratios -- typically 0.025% to 0.15%
  of the amount you invest. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t4. Bid-Ask Spread: Besides commissions,
  investors also pay what’s called a “spread” when they buy or sell stocks or mutual
  funds. This cost is one that is often overlooked by investors -- but it should definitely
  be on your radar. When you look up the price of a fund or stock and you see it’s
  $20 per share (that’s the “bid”). But the price you have to pay if you want to buy
  the share (the “ask”) is always a little higher (say, $20.50, in our example). The
  difference between the two is the bid-ask spread and every buyer -- including giant
  mutual funds -- must pay it.Given the size and number of the trades mutual funds
  make, the bid-ask spread may result in additional costs for mutual fund shareholders.
  These costs may be minimized by avoiding funds with a high-turnover rate (a.k.a.
  heavy trading activity) which may generate higher total trading costs. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t5.
  Liquidity Costs:You’ve heard of a “buyer’s market” or a “seller’s market” referring
  to real estate. The same concept is at play in the stock market, too. Investors
  can only buy or sell a stock or mutual fund if someone else is willing to sell or
  buy their shares. So when a fund has low liquidity -- also called low trading volume
  because there’s not a lot of buying and selling going on -- investors have a harder
  time fulfilling their trades in a timely and cost-effective manner. If a fund’s
  price drops and a lot of investors decide to withdraw their money at once, those
  who weren’t able to get out early are going to be left trying to sell shares at
  fire-sale prices.Typically you’ll see low liquidity in newer funds and ones that
  don’t have a lot of assets under management. It behooves investors to check a fund’s
  liquidity because it has a direct effect on the bid-ask spread and can make it expensive
  to build a portfolio. At FutureAdvisor we only select funds that have been around
  for a sufficient amount of time and have significant assets in the funds and good
  daily trading volume (high liquidity). \n\t\t\t\t\t\t6. Tax Cost Ratio: Lastly,
  we end with a word about taxes. Obviously, you want to keep tax costs down as much
  as possible. But in some situations you have little control. When a mutual fund
  distributes dividends (from stocks or bonds within the fund), and capital gains
  to shareholders, that counts as income and gets Uncle Sam’s attention. It doesn’t
  matter if the distributions are paid out in cash or reinvested to purchase additional
  shares: Investors are required to pay taxes on that income for the year in which
  it was received. The “tax cost ratio” can vary depending on how much buying and
  selling is done within the fund. According to Morningstar, fund tax cost ratios
  fall somewhere between 0 (the fund generated no taxable distributions) and 5 (indicating
  a less tax-efficient fund).  Each percent you pay in taxes lowers your return on
  an after-tax basis. (Note: If you hold the fund in a tax-deferred account (like
  a 401(k) or Traditional IRA), you’re off the hook for taxes until you start making
  withdrawals.) [Morningstar: http://bit.ly/1G1r5ey]It behooves investors who are
  considering buying or selling in a taxable account to beware of funds that have
  a high turnover rate (generating more frequent taxable events). Also, watch your
  timing: Avoid buying a fund right before it pays out a distribution (which typically
  occurs at the end of the year). Otherwise you’ll end up buying yourself a tax bill
  on investments that you didn’t even get the chance to profit from.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tSee

  it comes to managing your money, everyone wants a piece of the action -- brokerages,
  fund companies, retirement plan administrators, advisors, planners, and, of course,
  Uncle Sam.AuthorAfter you take into account commissions, management costs and cryptic
  sounding stuff like 12b-1 fees, every dollar that you save and invest is more like
  98 cents working for your future. A couple of pennies falling through the cracks
  may not sound like much, but remember: Every penny you sacrifice in fees is a penny
  that’s not able to compound and grow over time. When it comes to fees, compounding
  is working against you: Instead small amounts of money growing over time in your
  favor, it’s small fees compounding into massive costs. (Just in case you need a
  little more convincing: Are You Using Compound Interest For Good or Evil?)Ideally,
  investing fees should gobble up no more than 1% of your overall portfolio value.
  These days with so many low-cost investing options, that’s an easy guideline to
  stick to -- at least you’d think it would be.When it comes to managing money, everyone
  wants a piece of the action -- brokerages, fund companies, retirement plan administrators,

  a mutual fund (unless the fund company is part of the broker’s network). But fees
  for things like options trading, broker-assisted trades, REITs and other types of
  investments can be much more. And don’t forget about other costs you may have to

  called a “spread” when they buy or sell stocks or mutual funds. This cost is one
  that is often overlooked by investors -- but it should definitely be on your radar.
  When you look up the price of a fund or stock and you see it’s $20 per share (that’s
  the “bid”). But the price you have to pay if you want to buy the share (the “ask”)
  is always a little higher (say, $20.50, in our example). The difference between
  the two is the bid-ask spread and every buyer -- including giant mutual funds --
  must pay it.Given the size and number of the trades mutual funds make, the bid-ask
  spread may result in additional costs for mutual fund shareholders. These costs
  may be minimized by avoiding funds with a high-turnover rate (a.k.a. heavy trading
  activity) which may generate higher total trading costs. You’ve heard of a “buyer’s
  market” or a “seller’s market” referring to real estate. The same concept is at
  play in the stock market, too. Investors can only buy or sell a stock or mutual
  fund if someone else is willing to sell or buy their shares. So when a fund has
  low liquidity -- also called low trading volume because there’s not a lot of buying
  and selling going on -- investors have a harder time fulfilling their trades in
  a timely and cost-effective manner. If a fund’s price drops and a lot of investors
  decide to withdraw their money at once, those who weren’t able to get out early
  are going to be left trying to sell shares at fire-sale prices.Typically you’ll
  see low liquidity in newer funds and ones that don’t have a lot of assets under
  management. It behooves investors to check a fund’s liquidity because it has a direct
  effect on the bid-ask spread and can make it expensive to build a portfolio. At
  FutureAdvisor we only select funds that have been around for a sufficient amount
  of time and have significant assets in the funds and good daily trading volume (high
  liquidity). Lastly, we end with a word about taxes. Obviously, you want to keep
  tax costs down as much as possible. But in some situations you have little control.
  When a mutual fund distributes dividends (from stocks or bonds within the fund),
  and capital gains to shareholders, that counts as income and gets Uncle Sam’s attention.
  It doesn’t matter if the distributions are paid out in cash or reinvested to purchase
  additional shares: Investors are required to pay taxes on that income for the year
  in which it was received. The “tax cost ratio” can vary depending on how much buying
  and selling is done within the fund. According to Morningstar, fund tax cost ratios
  fall somewhere between 0 (the fund generated no taxable distributions) and 5 (indicating
  a less tax-efficient fund).  Each percent you pay in taxes lowers your return on
  an after-tax basis. (Note: If you hold the fund in a tax-deferred account (like
  a 401(k) or Traditional IRA), you’re off the hook for taxes until you start making
  withdrawals.) [Morningstar: http://bit.ly/1G1r5ey]It behooves investors who are
  considering buying or selling in a taxable account to beware of funds that have
  a high turnover rate (generating more frequent taxable events). Also, watch your
  timing: Avoid buying a fund right before it pays out a distribution (which typically
  occurs at the end of the year). Otherwise you’ll end up buying yourself a tax bill
  on investments that you didn’t even get the chance to profit from.  Don’t spend
  one more dollar on unnecessary fees. Get a free detailed screen of your current
  investments (including the ones in your 401(k)). We’ll point out any fee funny business
  and recommend low-cost, tax-efficient, diversified mutual funds and ETFs to replace
  any fee-laden ones that you currently own.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAuthorMillionaires have
