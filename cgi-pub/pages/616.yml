- "development to produce devices which could remove the drudgery of \r\n"
- "computation. The\r\n"
- "very first requirement was the invention of a means to record numbers. \r\n"
- "Various means\r\n"

  is quite well known that the United States Army Ordnance Corps has made\r\nmany
  significant contributions to both science and industry. Of all its\r\ncontributions
  however, few can match the importance of the Ordnance Corps' \r\npioneer efforts
  in the field of electronic computers.  In the interest of \r\nnational defense,
  the development of electronic computing systems could not wait until normal\r\neconomic
  laws brought about the supply of systems through commercial demand.\r\nTherefore,
  recognizing the urgent need for such computers, the Ordnance \r\nCorps initiated
  the development work and supplied the funds that led to the first \r\nhigh-speed,
  electronic, automatic computer. This computer, called the ENIAC \r\n(Electronic
  Numerical Integrator And Computer), was proposed in 1942 and completed in \r\n1946.\r\n\r\n\tThe
  installation of the ENIAC in 1947 in the Ballistic Research Laboratories\r\nat Aberdeen
  Proving Ground, Maryland, marked the beginning of the \r\nwidespread use of\r\nelectronic
  computing machines. Since the advent of the ENIAC, a large \r\nexpansion has\r\ntaken
  place in the computer field. Investment rates in computing equipment \r\nin the\r\nUnited
  States rose from ten million dollars per year in 1953 to one hundred \r\nmillion\r\ndollars
  per year in 1956. Present (1961) expenditures for computing \r\nequipment has\r\npassed
  the billion dollars per year mark.\r\n\r\n\tElectronic computers find wide use throughout
  the Department of Defense and\r\nmany other government agencies. Almost every commodity
  industry such as oil,\r\nsteel, and rubber is utilizing computing equipment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  Ord. Mono. 1961, INTRODUCTION , starting page 002\r\n Click here

  applications. Service industries,\r\nsuch as banking, transportation, and insurance
  have applied large scale\r\ncomputing systems toward the solution of problems in
  the fields of accounting, \r\nreservations control, and bookkeeping. Manufacturers
  have\r\nused computing systems for design engineering and scientific research.\r\nMany
  systems are being utilized for inventory and stock control. The determination \r\nof
  manufacturing plant location and stock parts storage are\r\nbeing made by linear
  programming methods. Electronic computers are used\r\nby the construction industry
  for design and location of structures and\r\nroad nets. Many digital computers form
  a part of closed loop industrial\r\nprocess control systems. Where the processing
  of large quantities of\r\ndata are necessary, computing systems are invaluable.\r\n\r\n\tIt
  must be left for the historian of the future to accurately evaluate\r\nthe effect
  of automatic computing machines on man's destiny. It is yet\r\ntoo early to make
  even a good guess. However, one thing is certain:\r\nelectronic computers have ushered
  in a change equal to that of the Industrial \r\nRevolution. By the harnessing of
  mechanical power (steam engine,\r\netc.) man was able to perform work beyond the
  capacity of his own muscles\r\n(or that of beasts of burden) and his world changed
  as a result. He\r\ncould travel at speeds undreamed of in earlier times, he could
  fabricate\r\nstructures never before possible, and he could build machinery to perform\r\nintricate
  work and produce large quantities of consumer goods at low cost.\r\nBy the development
  of machinery for handling information and thus enabling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
  \ Ord. Mono. 1961, INTRODUCTION , starting page 003\r\n Click here for TIF version
  of this page\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecisions to be made automatically by
  mechanizing the logic of mental \r\nprocess, man\r\nis now able to perform mental
  work beyond the capacity of his brain. Many \r\nproblems\r\nthat have remained unsolved
  for years because the calculations were too \r\nformidable\r\nfor a human to perform
  can now be handled by electronic computers. Aircraft \r\ndesign,\r\nballistic crystallography,
  electron optics, astronomy, pure mathematics, and\r\nweather forecasting are just
  a few of the activities in which automatic \r\ncomputing\r\nmachines are and will
  continue to play ever increasingly important roles.\r\n\r\n\tAt this point it might
  be well to consider the question; \"What is an \r\nautomatic\r\ncomputer?\" An automatic
  computer is a machine so constructed that it can \r\nperform a\r\ncomplicated sequence
  of arithmetical and logical operations at high speeds, \r\nwithout\r\nhuman intervention
  or assistance. The present-day automatic computers \r\nutilize\r\nelectronic circuits
  as the major operating components and are capable of \r\ncomputing\r\nspeeds of
  the order of a few millimicroseconds per logical decision. We can \r\nproperly\r\nrefer
  to this class of machines as high-speed electronic automatic \r\ncomputers.\r\n\r\n\tIt
  is the term \"automatic\", however, that designates the most important\r\ncharacteristic
  of the modern electronic computer. This is its ability to \r\nguide and\r\ncontrol
  itself during the course of its data processing action. The human \r\noperator\r\nis
  needed only to set up and start the machine, which can then operate \r\nwithout
  human\r\nintervention, guidance, or direction. However, the machine is \r\nself-directing
  only\r\nwithin definite prescribed limits which must be predetermined by the \r\noperator
  during\r\nthe setup of the machine and during programming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
  \ Ord. Mono. 1961, INTRODUCTION , starting page 004\r\n Click here for TIF version
  of this page\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAutomatic computers perform many operations
  which previously were\r\ndone only by human labor and this has led some writers
  to refer to\r\n automatic computers as \"giant brains\". They definitely are not
  electronic\r\nbrains and do not \"think\" in the creative sense of the word. A human
  mind\r\nmust first determine a way of solving the problem and then instruct the\r\ncomputer
  how to solve the problem when given the data. The human operation\r\nof preparing
  the instructions for the automatic computer is called \r\nprogramming, and the resulting
  set of instructions is called a program or a\r\nroutine. Without a program, an automatic
  computer cannot perform any\r\ndata processing.\r\n\r\n\tAll computers, whether
  mechanical or electronic, can be divided into\r\ntwo distinct classes, depending
  on the form in which information is handled.\r\nIf the information is handled in
  the form of letters or digits they are\r\nclassed as digital computers. If the information
  is handled in the form\r\nof an electrical equivalent of physical variables, they
  are classed as\r\nanalog computers. Analog computers may also represent numerical
  quantities \r\nby such physical variables as translation, rotation, voltage, or
  resistance. \r\nThe slide rule and the antiaircraft predictor are examples of\r\nanalog
  computers. The digital computer utilizes numbers in a given scale\r\nof notation
  to represent all the quantities that occur in a problem or a\r\ncalculation. The
  abacus and the desk calculator are examples of digital\r\ncomputers.\r\n\r\n\tIn
  a very general way it can be said that the advantages of the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

  are its greater flexibility \r\nand\r\ngreater precision, while its disadvantages
  are its higher cost and greater\r\ncomplexity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tMore and more emphasis
  is being placed on the digital computer although \r\nthere\r\nare still some applications
  where the analog computer is desirable. \r\nThroughout the\r\nOrdnance Corps the
  digital computer is the one most widely used for the \r\nvarious\r\nOrdnance applications.
  The analog computer finds use primarily in the older\r\nantiaircraft and antimissile
  fire control devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe importance of automatic computers to the
  U. S. Army Ordnance Corps is \r\nwell\r\nillustrated by the extensive use of various
  types of computers at Ordnance \r\nCorps\r\ninstallations. An inventory of computers
  within the Ordnance Corps for the \r\nFiscal\r\nYear 1961 lists a total of 112 computers
  of 36 different types in use at 26 \r\nOrdnance\r\nCorps installations.1\r\n\r\n\tAt
  Aberdeen Proving Ground, for example, the Computing Laboratory has a\r\npersonnel
  strength representing 12% of the total personnel of the \r\nBallistic, Research\r\nLaboratories.
  The Computing Laboratory employs 122 persons. These include: \r\n51\r\nMathematicians;
  15 Electronics Engineers; 4 Tabulating Equipment Operators; \r\n38\r\nMaintenance
  and Supporting personnel; and 14 military.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ord. Mono.

  I\r\n\r\nPRE-ELECTRONIC COMPUTING DEVICES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe first high-speed
  electronic automatic computer, the ENIAC, was put into\r\noperation at Aberdeen
  Proving Ground in 1947 and introduced an era of\r\npossibilities never before available
  to the field of computation. It was \r\none of\r\nthe most significant developments
  of our time because it enabled us to \r\nexpand our\r\nknowledge in almost every
  field through limitless quantities of accurate,\r\ninexpensive computation performed
  at high speeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPrior to the advent of the ENIAC, however, were thousands
  of years of\r\ndevelopment to produce devices which could remove the drudgery of
  \r\ncomputation. The\r\nvery first requirement was the invention of a means to record
  numbers. \r\nVarious means\r\nwere used in early times to do this. The Hebrews,
  Greeks and Romans, for \r\nexample,\r\nused the letters of their alphabets to represent
  numbers, but these systems \r\ndid not\r\nlend themselves to easy computation of
  mathematical problems. Anyone \r\nfamiliar, with\r\nthe Roman numeral system can
  imagine the difficulty in multiplying CCXVII \r\nby XXIX to get MMMMMMCCXC111.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn
  spite of clumsy systems of recording numbers Egyptians, Greeks and Romans\r\nwere
  nonetheless able to perform computations. A method of finger \r\ncomputation evolved\r\nand
  at some time prior to 600 B. C. an ingenious calculating device, the \r\nabacus,
  was\r\ndeveloped and used by them. This calculating device employed a place system
  \r\nand was\r\nbuilt around the base ten. Strangely enough it seems never to have
  occurred \r\nto those\r\npeople\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ord. Mono. 1961, CHAPTER I,
  starting page 007\r\n Click here for TIF version of this page\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nto
  write numerals in this same system. That idea was to come many years \r\nlater from
  India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe Roman-type abacus found its way to the Orient around the
  twelfth century\r\nA.D. and today it still remains the principal means of computing
  in China \r\nand Japan.\r\nIt is a simple device and a skilled operator can add,
  subtract, multiply \r\nand divide\r\nwith amazing speed. In fact, the champion abacus
  operator of Japan some \r\nyears ago\r\ndefeated a man using an electric calculating
  machine. The achievement of \r\nsuch speed\r\nand accuracy on the abacus, however,
  requires considerable training, which \r\nis one\r\ndisadvantage of the abacus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe
  modern abacus consists of a rectangular frame with a number of rods or\r\nwires.
  These rods are divided into two unequal portions by a transverse \r\nbar. On the\r\nupper,
  smaller portion of each rod are two beads and on the lower portion \r\nfive beads.\r\n(The
  modern Japanese abacus has one bead above and four beads below the \r\nbar.) The\r\nwhole
  acts as a numerical register, each rod representing a decimal order \r\nas in our\r\nfamiliar
  \"Arabic\" notation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe chief disadvantage of the abacus is that the
  operator must perform his\r\ncalculations mentally. The device merely stores his
  results step by step. \r\nIt does not\r\nperform the actual calculations as does
  the modern desk calculator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAs mentioned previously, in spite of the
  use of the abacus by the Greeks and\r\nRomans the Western peoples did not develop
  a convenient system of \r\nnumeration. This was\r\naccomplished by Hindu scholars
  nearly two thousand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ord. Mono. 1961, CHAPTER I, starting page

  ago. They developed the symbols and the place system which enables us \r\nto\r\nexpress
  any number, no matter how large or small it may be. This system is \r\neasy to\r\nlearn
  and simple to use. It is built around the base ten, although any \r\nnumber\r\nmight
  have been used. It is possible that the base of ten was selected \r\nbecause man\r\nhad
  always used his fingers for counting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe Hindu numerals with their
  place system were carried westward by \r\nmerchants\r\nand scholars and finally
  reached Spain in the tenth century. However it was \r\nnot until\r\nthe fifteenth
  century that they finally prevailed, in the Western World and \r\ntook their\r\npresent
  form 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. This development opened the \r\ndoor to modern\r\nmathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAround
  1600 John Napier, a Scottish mathematician, invented logarithms and \r\nalso\r\nprepared
  a convenient multiplication table on pieces of wood or bone. \r\n\"Napier's bone\",\r\nas
  they were called, had no practical value but his logarithms did. Around \r\n1632\r\nWilliam
  Oughtred in England made the first slide rule by inscribing \r\nlogarithms on wood\r\nor
  ivory. The slide rule is an analog computer which is still widely used by\r\nscientists
  and engineers throughout the entire world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tShortly after Napier's achievements,
  around 1642, Blaise Pascal in France\r\nconstructed an adding machine that resembled
  the modern desk calculator. \r\nThis machine\r\nconsisted of a series of ratchet-driven
  wheels with the numbers 0 to 9 on \r\nthem.\r\nAlthough it was a simple device and
  could only add and subtract it embodied \r\none very\r\nimportant development which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

  technique, namely a means of making \r\nthe\r\n\"carry over\" into an automatic
  process. It also indicated the possibility of\r\nmultiplying numbers by successive
  addition. For the first time a machine \r\nwas built\r\nthat approached automatic
  computing because it removed a function from the \r\noperator\r\nto the machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn
  1671 Gottfried Leibnitz, in Germany, invented the stepped-wheel, a\r\ncylindrical
  drum having nine teeth of increasing length along its surface. \r\nWhen the\r\ndrum
  was rotated, a gear sliding on an axis parallel to that of the drum \r\nengaged
  some\r\nof the teeth, thereby undergoing a corresponding number of rotation steps.
  \r\nThe\r\nLeibnitz wheel made it possible to multiply quickly by repeated additions.
  \r\nFrom then\r\nonwards a variety of improved calculating machines were devised,
  all based \r\non the\r\noriginal idea of wheels moved around in steps, and by the
  nineteenth century\r\ncommercial models began to appear. The Thomas machine (France)
  embodied this\r\nprinciple and, starting in 1822, was the first to be manufactured
  for \r\nwidespread use.\r\nIt was a dependable, crank-operated, four-process machine.
  In 1885 \r\nBurroughs, in the\r\nUnited States, produced an adding machine and in
  1902 the first machine with\r\ncompletely automatic multiplication and division
  was built by Rechnitzer, \r\nalso in the\r\nUnited States. Several machines were
  designed in various countries and by \r\n1920, with\r\nthe fully automatic Monroe
  machine, we reach the stage of desk calculators \r\nfamiliar\r\nto us in banks,
  offices and laboratories. These are the machines that do \r\nmost of the\r\nworld's
  computation, the modern ones being electrically driven and assuming \r\nmore and\r\nmore
  of the operator's functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ord. Mono. 1961, CHAPTER I,

  machines, however, are limited in scope and require the constant\r\nattention of
  a human operator to supply them with numbers and to record on \r\npaper\r\nthe result
  of each stage of the calculation before proceeding to the next \r\none. They\r\ndo
  save time and mental effort but they are not fast enough where very large\r\nquantities
  of numerical data have to\r\n--be handled. ii must also be noted that they are not
  true forerunners of \r\nthe modern\r\nelectronic computers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe principles
  of modern computers, albeit in mechanical form, were laid \r\ndown by\r\nCharles
  Babbage in England. Starting in 1812 he attempted to ' build an \r\nautomatic\r\nmechanical
  calculator. He was familiar with Mullers idea for a difference \r\nengine\r\n(1786)
  and Jaques' idea for controlling a loom by means of punched holes \r\n(1775). He\r\nincorporated
  both ideas and actually made models of a difference engine \r\nwhich was card\r\ncontrolled.
  Technical problems of construction were too great for mechanical\r\nengineering
  of that period and the computer was never finished. Later, \r\nBabbage\r\nconceived
  an even more ambitious idea. He worked on the design of an \r\nanalytical\r\nengine,
  which, had it been built, would have incorporated ideas familiar to \r\nthe modern\r\ndigital
  computer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBabbage's new idea was to extend the capabilities of the
  difference engine \r\nso\r\nthat it could not merely add and print, but also multiply,
  divide, and call \r\nfor new\r\ndata from its human operator. In order for the analytical
  engine to perform \r\nthe tasks\r\nexpected of it, it was necessary to express all
  the possible instructions \r\nto the\r\nmachine in the form of stereotyped commands.
  Such a procedure is known as \r\nthe logic or\r\nthe logical design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
  \ Ord. Mono. 1961, CHAPTER I, starting page 011\r\n Click here for TIF version of
  this page\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n of a\r\ncomputer, and Babbage's engine was
  strikingly modern in regard to its \r\nlogical design.\r\nExcept for the need of
  a human attendant to read into the machine values \r\nfrom\r\nmathematical tables,
  this engine was logically parallel to most of the \r\nrecent\r\nautomatic computers.
  Naturally the speed of computation would have been far \r\nbelow that\r\nof the
  modern calculator (it could perform one addition per second), since \r\nBabbage
  had\r\nto use the purely mechanical techniques available in his day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tA
  significant part of his design for an analytical engine was the use of a\r\n\"store\"
  for holding the partial results of arithmetic operations performed \r\nin what he\r\ncalled
  the \"mill\". To feed numbers into the machine he proposed a system \r\nusing patterns\r\nof
  holes punched in cards, while the results of calculations were to be \r\npresented
  by a\r\nmechanism which would set up the appropriate numerals in type ready for
  \r\nprinting.\r\nAnother proposal was that the engine should be capable of deciding
  on a \r\ncourse of\r\naction in the light of partial results obtained. He called
  this the \r\n\"control\". All\r\nthese ideas have become features of the modern
  digital computer, and it is \r\nmainly\r\nbecause of them that our present-day machines
  are so fast in operation and \r\nso versatile\r\nin their range of calculations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe
  next important development along this line was made by Hollerith and\r\nPowers during
  1880-1890. Working for the United States Census Bureau they \r\nrequired\r\nsome
  means of handling large masses of information. This led to the \r\ndevelopment of\r\nthe
  first key punch, the first sorter, and the first tabulator, al) using \r\nlarge\r\npunched
  cards. The patterns of round\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ord. Mono. 1961, CHAPTER I,
  starting page 012\r\n Click here for TIF version of this page\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nholes
  in the cards were formed by using a crude hand-punching device. The \r\ncards\r\ncould
  be sorted into the series or order wanted, and then tabulated to \r\nreduce the\r\ncensus
  data to manageable form. Hollerith did not use the punched cards to \r\ncontrol\r\nthe
  course of computation, but simply used the holes in the cards to carry\r\ninformation.
  Hollerith and Powers also employed the electromagnetic \r\ntechniques in\r\ntheir
  machine, that is, information on the card (hole or no hole) was \r\nconverted\r\ninto
  electric impulses, and the electric impulses actuated devices known as\r\nrelays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn
  1925, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dr. Vannevar Bush \r\nand his\r\nassociates
  began studying the problem of designing a machine to solve \r\ndifferential\r\nequations.
  In 1927, Dr. Bush started work on a mechanical differential \r\nanalyser. He\r\nexperimented
  with mechanisms that would integrate, add, multiply, etc., and \r\nmethods of\r\nconnecting
  them together in a machine. Originally he made use of electrical \r\ncurrents\r\nflowing
  through watt-hour meters, which integrate the electrical power \r\nabsorbed by\r\ncircuits
  attached to them. Later he reverted to the mechanical integrators \r\nof the\r\nwheel
  and disc type. A major part of the success of the machine depended on \r\na device\r\nwhereby
  a very small turning force would do a rather large amount of work. \r\nBy careful\r\ndesign
  of the discs and of the wheel mountings, Dr. Bush was able to make \r\nthe\r\nintegrators
  accurate, and, by introducing torque amplifiers to take the \r\nloads off the\r\nwheels
  so that they rotated very freely, he was able to reduce the slippage \r\nbetween\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

  with the integrators, which\r\ncontained movable shafts, changeable gears and couplings,
  input hand-\r\nwheels and output recording pens for producing a readable result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBy
  1930 the first differential analyser was finished. It was entirely \r\nmechanical,
  having no electrical parts except the motors. Its disadvantage \r\nwas the great
  deal of work required in changing from one problem\r\nto another. This involved
  undoing old mechanical connections between\r\nshafts and setting up new ones. For
  this reason the design of a second\r\nanalyser was begun in 1935, on which all connections
  could be made electrically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAs early as 1932 personnel of the Ballistic
  Section at Aberdeen Proving \r\nGround had investigated the possible use of the
  Differential Analyser\r\nfor ballistic computations. The machine was used to compute
  numerous\r\ntrajectories including a set sufficient for the preparation of a complete\r\nrange
  table. (t was also tested on interior ballistic problems. A careful\r\n study and
  evaluation of the results of this investigation led to the\r\nfollowing conclusions:\r\n\t
  Such a machine could be built at Aberdeen Proving Ground.\r\n\t  The machine could
  perform various kinds of ballistic computations\r\nwith the necessary accuracy.\r\n\r\n\t
  \ Operation and maintenance would require no unusual skill.\r\n\t  The speed of
  the machine was such that it would insure greatly\r\nincreased output of work by
  the Ballistic Section in any emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ord. Mono.

  \tIt could perform routine work at a smaller total expenditure of\r\nfunds.\r\n\t
  \tIts use in the preparation of range tables would replace numerous\r\ncomplicated
  and indirect methods by simple, uniform and direct process.\r\n\t \tIts use would
  permit the investigation of various problems, the\r\nsolution of which was necessary
  to any advance in ballistic theory or\r\npractice but which previously could not
  be studied because existing methods\r\nrequired a prohibitive amount of computing
  labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIt was decided to use the Bush Differential Analyser at Aberdeen
  Proving \r\nGround\r\nand its installation was completed in 1935. After final adjustment
  and \r\ntrials it\r\nwas used in the computation of two firing tables. These were
  completed with\r\ngratifying results by mid 1936.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe Bush Differential
  Analyser, an analog device, was installed under the\r\ndirection of Major James
  Guion, who was in charge of the Ballistic \r\nComputing Section\r\nat Aberdeen Proving
  Ground at that time. Major Guion had been quick to \r\nrealize the\r\nvalue of this
  continuous variable calculator to the Computational needs of \r\nthe\r\nOrdnance
  Department. The Availability   of this machine and the \r\nexperience that\r\nwas
  gained in its use were invaluable to the Ordnance Department during the \r\ncrucial\r\ntransition
  period prior to America's entry into World War 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe analyser installed
  at APG had ten integrating units and provisions for\r\ntwo input and two output
  tables. However, despite its value\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ord. Mono. 1961, CHAPTER

  important mechanical aid to computation it had certain limitations. The \r\ntorque\r\namplifier,
  for example, although simple in mechanical design, frequently \r\nfailed\r\ntoward
  the end of a long trajectory run with the loss of the preceding \r\ncomputation\r\nand
  an appreciable delay associated with its repair. This type of failure \r\nand the\r\ninterference
  that it caused with the carrying out of computations at the \r\nBallistic\r\nResearch
  Laboratory led to extensive study to overcome this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAt the
  outbreak of World War II in Europe the officer in charge of ballistic\r\ncomputations
  at APG was. Lt. P. N. Gillon. He immediately recognized the \r\nimmensity of\r\nthe
  task that would fall upon the Ordnance Department in the event of \r\nUnited States\r\nparticipation
  in the war and this prompted him to seek both marked \r\nimprovement in\r\nmechanical
  aids to computation and augmented facilities for its \r\naccomplishment. A\r\nnumber
  of very important things were undertaken to accomplish this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe
  Moore School of Electrical Engineering of the University of \r\nPennsylvania had\r\na
  Bush Differential Analyser of somewhat larger capacity than the one at \r\nAberdeen\r\nProving
  Ground. It had fourteen integrating units instead of ten. Therefore \r\nthe\r\nOrdnance
  Department awarded a contract to the University of Pennsylvania \r\nfor the\r\nutilization
  of this device. Several additional contracts were later awarded \r\nto the\r\nUniversity
  to carry out different phases of the increasingly important role \r\nwhich it\r\nwas
  to play in the computation activities of the Ordnance Department during \r\nthe
  war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ord. Mono. 1961, CHAPTER I, starting page 016\r\n

  Gillon, in his capacity as officer in charge of ballistic\r\ncomputations, conferred
  frequently with Dean Pender, Professor Brainerd, \r\nand their\r\nassociates at
  the Moore School in order to effect proper coordination of the\r\ncomputational
  work at the two localities, Philadelphia and Aberdeen. There \r\nwas a\r\nvery talented
  group at the Moore School under the direction of Professor \r\nBrainerd\r\nand as
  a result of Lt. Gillon's discussions with them Assistant Professor \r\nWeygand\r\nundertook
  to develop an electronic torque amplifier to replace the \r\nmechanical\r\ntorque
  amplifiers on the Bush Differential Analysers. This work was \r\neminently\r\nsuccessful
  and, in addition, photoelectric followers were developed by the \r\nMoore\r\nSchool
  group for both the input and output tables of the analyser. As a \r\nresult of\r\nthese
  accomplishments the productive capacity of the analysers at both the \r\nMoore\r\nSchool
  and Aberdeen Proving Ground were enhanced by at least an order of\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tDuring
  World War II the Bush Differential Analyser was used primarily to\r\ncompute trajectories
  for firing tables and to prepare trajectory charts for \r\nuse with\r\nUT fuzes.
  The machine could compute a 60-second trajectory in about 15 \r\nminutes,\r\nwhereas
  a human operator using a desk calculator required about 20 hours to \r\nperform\r\nthe
  same computation. Its value to the Ordnance Department during the war \r\nyears
  was\r\ntremendous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe next major development, prior to the advent
  of the high-speed electronic\r\nautomatic computer, came in 1944 when Howard Aiken,
  in cooperation with \r\nsome IBM\r\nengineers and some graduate students at Harvard
  University, completed the \r\nMark I\r\nRelay Computer, also called the Automatic
  \ Sequence-Controlled Calculator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ord. Mono. 1961,

  \r\n\r\n\r\n\tThis machine performed thousands of calculating steps, one after another,\r\naccording
  to a scheme fixed ahead of time. Its individual operations were\r\nautomatic, once
  the punched tape fixing the chain of operations had been \r\nput on\r\nthe machine,
  and it was sequence-controlled, since control over the \r\nsequence of\r\nits operations
  was built into the machine.\r\n\tThe principle of operation of the Mark I Relay
  Computer was \r\nelectromechanical.\r\nIt combined the two applications of the concept
  of state, that is, the \r\ninformation\r\nfor processing was represented by patterns
  of open and closed relays (like \r\nthe\r\npatterns of holes and no holes which
  Babbage used).\r\n\tAlthough the machine was efficient, fast, and capable of solving
  a variety\r\nof problems its speed could not approach that of the electronic computer,
  \r\nwhich\r\nis the next state in the development of computers and the subject of
  this\r\nmonograph. Nevertheless, it holds a permanent place in the history of \r\ndevelopment\r\nof
  calculating machines, since it was the first automatic machine to be\r\ncompleted.
  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   BRL at APG used two types of relay computers during 1947-1954.
  Two \r\nIBM Relay\r\nCalculators were used for a short time but were not successful.
  Two Bell \r\nRelay\r\nComputers were used. They were accurate, but slow and required
  expert \r\nmaintenance.\r\nOust and humidity adversely affected their operation.
  However many useful \r\nresults were\r\nobtained from the twin Bell Relay Computers
  during many years of successful \r\noperation.\r\nOne good feature of the Bell Relay
  Machines was that they would run 16 hours\r\novernight, unattended. A problem regularly
  would be placed on the computer \r\nat 4:00 PM.\r\nThe next morning, arriving operating
  personnel would find the problem \r\nsolved and the\r\nmachine waiting, or the machine
  still feverishly running the problem to a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  Ord. Mono.

  is quite well known that the United States Army Ordnance Corps has made\r\nmany
  significant contributions to both science and industry. Of all its\r\ncontributions
  however, few can match the importance of the Ordnance Corps' \r\npioneer efforts
  in the field of electronic computers.  In the interest of \r\nnational defense,
  the development of electronic computing systems could not wait until normal\r\neconomic
  laws brought about the supply of systems through commercial demand.\r\nTherefore,
  recognizing the urgent need for such computers, the Ordnance \r\nCorps initiated
  the development work and supplied the funds that led to the first \r\nhigh-speed,
  electronic, automatic computer. This computer, called the ENIAC \r\n(Electronic
  Numerical Integrator And Computer), was proposed in 1942 and completed in \r\n1946.\r\n\r\n\tThe
  installation of the ENIAC in 1947 in the Ballistic Research Laboratories\r\nat Aberdeen
  Proving Ground, Maryland, marked the beginning of the \r\nwidespread use of\r\nelectronic
  computing machines. Since the advent of the ENIAC, a large \r\nexpansion has\r\ntaken
  place in the computer field. Investment rates in computing equipment \r\nin the\r\nUnited
  States rose from ten million dollars per year in 1953 to one hundred \r\nmillion\r\ndollars
  per year in 1956. Present (1961) expenditures for computing \r\nequipment has\r\npassed
  the billion dollars per year mark.\r\n\r\n\tElectronic computers find wide use throughout
  the Department of Defense and\r\nmany other government agencies. Almost every commodity
  industry such as oil,\r\nsteel, and rubber is utilizing computing equipment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

  applications. Service industries,\r\nsuch as banking, transportation, and insurance
  have applied large scale\r\ncomputing systems toward the solution of problems in
  the fields of accounting, \r\nreservations control, and bookkeeping. Manufacturers
  have\r\nused computing systems for design engineering and scientific research.\r\nMany
  systems are being utilized for inventory and stock control. The determination \r\nof
  manufacturing plant location and stock parts storage are\r\nbeing made by linear
  programming methods. Electronic computers are used\r\nby the construction industry
  for design and location of structures and\r\nroad nets. Many digital computers form
  a part of closed loop industrial\r\nprocess control systems. Where the processing
  of large quantities of\r\ndata are necessary, computing systems are invaluable.\r\n\r\n\tIt
  must be left for the historian of the future to accurately evaluate\r\nthe effect
  of automatic computing machines on man's destiny. It is yet\r\ntoo early to make
  even a good guess. However, one thing is certain:\r\nelectronic computers have ushered
  in a change equal to that of the Industrial \r\nRevolution. By the harnessing of
  mechanical power (steam engine,\r\netc.) man was able to perform work beyond the
  capacity of his own muscles\r\n(or that of beasts of burden) and his world changed
  as a result. He\r\ncould travel at speeds undreamed of in earlier times, he could
  fabricate\r\nstructures never before possible, and he could build machinery to perform\r\nintricate
  work and produce large quantities of consumer goods at low cost.\r\nBy the development
  of machinery for handling information and thus enabling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

  work beyond the capacity of his brain. Many \r\nproblems\r\nthat have remained unsolved
  for years because the calculations were too \r\nformidable\r\nfor a human to perform
  can now be handled by electronic computers. Aircraft \r\ndesign,\r\nballistic crystallography,

  a few of the activities in which automatic \r\ncomputing\r\nmachines are and will
  continue to play ever increasingly important roles.\r\n\r\n\tAt this point it might
  be well to consider the question; \"What is an \r\nautomatic\r\ncomputer?\" An automatic
  computer is a machine so constructed that it can \r\nperform a\r\ncomplicated sequence
  of arithmetical and logical operations at high speeds, \r\nwithout\r\nhuman intervention
  or assistance. The present-day automatic computers \r\nutilize\r\nelectronic circuits
  as the major operating components and are capable of \r\ncomputing\r\nspeeds of
  the order of a few millimicroseconds per logical decision. We can \r\nproperly\r\nrefer
  to this class of machines as high-speed electronic automatic \r\ncomputers.\r\n\r\n\tIt
  is the term \"automatic\", however, that designates the most important\r\ncharacteristic
  of the modern electronic computer. This is its ability to \r\nguide and\r\ncontrol
  itself during the course of its data processing action. The human \r\noperator\r\nis
  needed only to set up and start the machine, which can then operate \r\nwithout
  human\r\nintervention, guidance, or direction. However, the machine is \r\nself-directing
  only\r\nwithin definite prescribed limits which must be predetermined by the \r\noperator
  during\r\nthe setup of the machine and during programming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

  which previously were\r\ndone only by human labor and this has led some writers
  to refer to\r\n automatic computers as \"giant brains\". They definitely are not
  electronic\r\nbrains and do not \"think\" in the creative sense of the word. A human
  mind\r\nmust first determine a way of solving the problem and then instruct the\r\ncomputer
  how to solve the problem when given the data. The human operation\r\nof preparing
  the instructions for the automatic computer is called \r\nprogramming, and the resulting
  set of instructions is called a program or a\r\nroutine. Without a program, an automatic
  computer cannot perform any\r\ndata processing.\r\n\r\n\tAll computers, whether
  mechanical or electronic, can be divided into\r\ntwo distinct classes, depending
  on the form in which information is handled.\r\nIf the information is handled in
  the form of letters or digits they are\r\nclassed as digital computers. If the information
  is handled in the form\r\nof an electrical equivalent of physical variables, they
  are classed as\r\nanalog computers. Analog computers may also represent numerical
  quantities \r\nby such physical variables as translation, rotation, voltage, or
  resistance. \r\nThe slide rule and the antiaircraft predictor are examples of\r\nanalog
  computers. The digital computer utilizes numbers in a given scale\r\nof notation
  to represent all the quantities that occur in a problem or a\r\ncalculation. The
  abacus and the desk calculator are examples of digital\r\ncomputers.\r\n\r\n\tIn

  are its higher cost and greater\r\ncomplexity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tMore and more emphasis
  is being placed on the digital computer although \r\nthere\r\nare still some applications
  where the analog computer is desirable. \r\nThroughout the\r\nOrdnance Corps the

  The analog computer finds use primarily in the older\r\nantiaircraft and antimissile
  fire control devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe importance of automatic computers to the
  U. S. Army Ordnance Corps is \r\nwell\r\nillustrated by the extensive use of various
  types of computers at Ordnance \r\nCorps\r\ninstallations. An inventory of computers
  within the Ordnance Corps for the \r\nFiscal\r\nYear 1961 lists a total of 112 computers

  I\r\n\r\nPRE-ELECTRONIC COMPUTING DEVICES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe first high-speed
  electronic automatic computer, the ENIAC, was put into\r\noperation at Aberdeen
  Proving Ground in 1947 and introduced an era of\r\npossibilities never before available
  to the field of computation. It was \r\none of\r\nthe most significant developments
  of our time because it enabled us to \r\nexpand our\r\nknowledge in almost every
  field through limitless quantities of accurate,\r\ninexpensive computation performed
  at high speeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPrior to the advent of the ENIAC, however, were thousands
  of years of\r\ndevelopment to produce devices which could remove the drudgery of
  \r\ncomputation. The\r\nvery first requirement was the invention of a means to record
  numbers. \r\nVarious means\r\nwere used in early times to do this. The Hebrews,
  Greeks and Romans, for \r\nexample,\r\nused the letters of their alphabets to represent
  numbers, but these systems \r\ndid not\r\nlend themselves to easy computation of
  mathematical problems. Anyone \r\nfamiliar, with\r\nthe Roman numeral system can
  imagine the difficulty in multiplying CCXVII \r\nby XXIX to get MMMMMMCCXC111.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn
  spite of clumsy systems of recording numbers Egyptians, Greeks and Romans\r\nwere
  nonetheless able to perform computations. A method of finger \r\ncomputation evolved\r\nand
  at some time prior to 600 B. C. an ingenious calculating device, the \r\nabacus,
  was\r\ndeveloped and used by them. This calculating device employed a place system
  \r\nand was\r\nbuilt around the base ten. Strangely enough it seems never to have
  occurred \r\nto those\r\npeople\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ord. Mono. 1961, CHAPTER I,
  starting page 007\r\n Click here for TIF version of this page\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nto
  write numerals in this same system. That idea was to come many years \r\nlater from
  India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe Roman-type abacus found its way to the Orient around the
  twelfth century\r\nA.D. and today it still remains the principal means of computing
  in China \r\nand Japan.\r\nIt is a simple device and a skilled operator can add,
  subtract, multiply \r\nand divide\r\nwith amazing speed. In fact, the champion abacus
  operator of Japan some \r\nyears ago\r\ndefeated a man using an electric calculating
  machine. The achievement of \r\nsuch speed\r\nand accuracy on the abacus, however,
  requires considerable training, which \r\nis one\r\ndisadvantage of the abacus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe
  modern abacus consists of a rectangular frame with a number of rods or\r\nwires.
  These rods are divided into two unequal portions by a transverse \r\nbar. On the\r\nupper,
  smaller portion of each rod are two beads and on the lower portion \r\nfive beads.\r\n(The
  modern Japanese abacus has one bead above and four beads below the \r\nbar.) The\r\nwhole
  acts as a numerical register, each rod representing a decimal order \r\nas in our\r\nfamiliar
  \"Arabic\" notation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe chief disadvantage of the abacus is that the
  operator must perform his\r\ncalculations mentally. The device merely stores his
  results step by step. \r\nIt does not\r\nperform the actual calculations as does
  the modern desk calculator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAs mentioned previously, in spite of the
  use of the abacus by the Greeks and\r\nRomans the Western peoples did not develop
  a convenient system of \r\nnumeration. This was\r\naccomplished by Hindu scholars
  nearly two thousand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ord. Mono. 1961, CHAPTER I, starting page

  ago. They developed the symbols and the place system which enables us \r\nto\r\nexpress
  any number, no matter how large or small it may be. This system is \r\neasy to\r\nlearn
  and simple to use. It is built around the base ten, although any \r\nnumber\r\nmight
  have been used. It is possible that the base of ten was selected \r\nbecause man\r\nhad
  always used his fingers for counting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe Hindu numerals with their
  place system were carried westward by \r\nmerchants\r\nand scholars and finally
  reached Spain in the tenth century. However it was \r\nnot until\r\nthe fifteenth
  century that they finally prevailed, in the Western World and \r\ntook their\r\npresent
  form 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. This development opened the \r\ndoor to modern\r\nmathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAround
  1600 John Napier, a Scottish mathematician, invented logarithms and \r\nalso\r\nprepared
  a convenient multiplication table on pieces of wood or bone. \r\n\"Napier's bone\",\r\nas
  they were called, had no practical value but his logarithms did. Around \r\n1632\r\nWilliam
  Oughtred in England made the first slide rule by inscribing \r\nlogarithms on wood\r\nor
  ivory. The slide rule is an analog computer which is still widely used by\r\nscientists
  and engineers throughout the entire world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tShortly after Napier's achievements,
  around 1642, Blaise Pascal in France\r\nconstructed an adding machine that resembled
  the modern desk calculator. \r\nThis machine\r\nconsisted of a series of ratchet-driven
  wheels with the numbers 0 to 9 on \r\nthem.\r\nAlthough it was a simple device and
  could only add and subtract it embodied \r\none very\r\nimportant development which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
  \ Ord. Mono. 1961, CHAPTER I, starting page 009\r\n Click here for TIF version of

  technique, namely a means of making \r\nthe\r\n\"carry over\" into an automatic
  process. It also indicated the possibility of\r\nmultiplying numbers by successive
  addition. For the first time a machine \r\nwas built\r\nthat approached automatic
  computing because it removed a function from the \r\noperator\r\nto the machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn
  1671 Gottfried Leibnitz, in Germany, invented the stepped-wheel, a\r\ncylindrical
  drum having nine teeth of increasing length along its surface. \r\nWhen the\r\ndrum
  was rotated, a gear sliding on an axis parallel to that of the drum \r\nengaged
  some\r\nof the teeth, thereby undergoing a corresponding number of rotation steps.
  \r\nThe\r\nLeibnitz wheel made it possible to multiply quickly by repeated additions.
  \r\nFrom then\r\nonwards a variety of improved calculating machines were devised,
  all based \r\non the\r\noriginal idea of wheels moved around in steps, and by the
  nineteenth century\r\ncommercial models began to appear. The Thomas machine (France)
  embodied this\r\nprinciple and, starting in 1822, was the first to be manufactured
  for \r\nwidespread use.\r\nIt was a dependable, crank-operated, four-process machine.
  In 1885 \r\nBurroughs, in the\r\nUnited States, produced an adding machine and in
  1902 the first machine with\r\ncompletely automatic multiplication and division
  was built by Rechnitzer, \r\nalso in the\r\nUnited States. Several machines were
  designed in various countries and by \r\n1920, with\r\nthe fully automatic Monroe
  machine, we reach the stage of desk calculators \r\nfamiliar\r\nto us in banks,
  offices and laboratories. These are the machines that do \r\nmost of the\r\nworld's
  computation, the modern ones being electrically driven and assuming \r\nmore and\r\nmore
  of the operator's functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ord. Mono. 1961, CHAPTER I,
  starting page 010\r\n Click here for TIF version of this page\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThese
  machines, however, are limited in scope and require the constant\r\nattention of
  a human operator to supply them with numbers and to record on \r\npaper\r\nthe result
  of each stage of the calculation before proceeding to the next \r\none. They\r\ndo
  save time and mental effort but they are not fast enough where very large\r\nquantities
  of numerical data have to\r\n--be handled. ii must also be noted that they are not
  true forerunners of \r\nthe modern\r\nelectronic computers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe principles
  of modern computers, albeit in mechanical form, were laid \r\ndown by\r\nCharles
  Babbage in England. Starting in 1812 he attempted to ' build an \r\nautomatic\r\nmechanical
  calculator. He was familiar with Mullers idea for a difference \r\nengine\r\n(1786)
  and Jaques' idea for controlling a loom by means of punched holes \r\n(1775). He\r\nincorporated
  both ideas and actually made models of a difference engine \r\nwhich was card\r\ncontrolled.
  Technical problems of construction were too great for mechanical\r\nengineering
  of that period and the computer was never finished. Later, \r\nBabbage\r\nconceived
  an even more ambitious idea. He worked on the design of an \r\nanalytical\r\nengine,
  which, had it been built, would have incorporated ideas familiar to \r\nthe modern\r\ndigital
  computer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBabbage's new idea was to extend the capabilities of the
  difference engine \r\nso\r\nthat it could not merely add and print, but also multiply,
  divide, and call \r\nfor new\r\ndata from its human operator. In order for the analytical
  engine to perform \r\nthe tasks\r\nexpected of it, it was necessary to express all
  the possible instructions \r\nto the\r\nmachine in the form of stereotyped commands.
  Such a procedure is known as \r\nthe logic or\r\nthe logical design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
  \ Ord. Mono. 1961, CHAPTER I, starting page 011\r\n Click here for TIF version of
  this page\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n of a\r\ncomputer, and Babbage's engine was
  strikingly modern in regard to its \r\nlogical design.\r\nExcept for the need of
  a human attendant to read into the machine values \r\nfrom\r\nmathematical tables,
  this engine was logically parallel to most of the \r\nrecent\r\nautomatic computers.
  Naturally the speed of computation would have been far \r\nbelow that\r\nof the
  modern calculator (it could perform one addition per second), since \r\nBabbage
  had\r\nto use the purely mechanical techniques available in his day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tA
  significant part of his design for an analytical engine was the use of a\r\n\"store\"
  for holding the partial results of arithmetic operations performed \r\nin what he\r\ncalled
  the \"mill\". To feed numbers into the machine he proposed a system \r\nusing patterns\r\nof
  holes punched in cards, while the results of calculations were to be \r\npresented
  by a\r\nmechanism which would set up the appropriate numerals in type ready for
  \r\nprinting.\r\nAnother proposal was that the engine should be capable of deciding
  on a \r\ncourse of\r\naction in the light of partial results obtained. He called
  this the \r\n\"control\". All\r\nthese ideas have become features of the modern
  digital computer, and it is \r\nmainly\r\nbecause of them that our present-day machines
  are so fast in operation and \r\nso versatile\r\nin their range of calculations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe
  next important development along this line was made by Hollerith and\r\nPowers during
  1880-1890. Working for the United States Census Bureau they \r\nrequired\r\nsome
  means of handling large masses of information. This led to the \r\ndevelopment of\r\nthe
  first key punch, the first sorter, and the first tabulator, al) using \r\nlarge\r\npunched
  cards. The patterns of round\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ord. Mono. 1961, CHAPTER I,
  starting page 012\r\n Click here for TIF version of this page\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nholes
  in the cards were formed by using a crude hand-punching device. The \r\ncards\r\ncould
  be sorted into the series or order wanted, and then tabulated to \r\nreduce the\r\ncensus
  data to manageable form. Hollerith did not use the punched cards to \r\ncontrol\r\nthe
  course of computation, but simply used the holes in the cards to carry\r\ninformation.
  Hollerith and Powers also employed the electromagnetic \r\ntechniques in\r\ntheir
  machine, that is, information on the card (hole or no hole) was \r\nconverted\r\ninto
  electric impulses, and the electric impulses actuated devices known as\r\nrelays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn
  1925, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dr. Vannevar Bush \r\nand his\r\nassociates
  began studying the problem of designing a machine to solve \r\ndifferential\r\nequations.
  In 1927, Dr. Bush started work on a mechanical differential \r\nanalyser. He\r\nexperimented
  with mechanisms that would integrate, add, multiply, etc., and \r\nmethods of\r\nconnecting
  them together in a machine. Originally he made use of electrical \r\ncurrents\r\nflowing
  through watt-hour meters, which integrate the electrical power \r\nabsorbed by\r\ncircuits
  attached to them. Later he reverted to the mechanical integrators \r\nof the\r\nwheel
  and disc type. A major part of the success of the machine depended on \r\na device\r\nwhereby
  a very small turning force would do a rather large amount of work. \r\nBy careful\r\ndesign
  of the discs and of the wheel mountings, Dr. Bush was able to make \r\nthe\r\nintegrators
  accurate, and, by introducing torque amplifiers to take the \r\nloads off the\r\nwheels
  so that they rotated very freely, he was able to reduce the slippage \r\nbetween\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

  with the integrators, which\r\ncontained movable shafts, changeable gears and couplings,
  input hand-\r\nwheels and output recording pens for producing a readable result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBy
  1930 the first differential analyser was finished. It was entirely \r\nmechanical,
  having no electrical parts except the motors. Its disadvantage \r\nwas the great
  deal of work required in changing from one problem\r\nto another. This involved
  undoing old mechanical connections between\r\nshafts and setting up new ones. For
  this reason the design of a second\r\nanalyser was begun in 1935, on which all connections
  could be made electrically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAs early as 1932 personnel of the Ballistic
  Section at Aberdeen Proving \r\nGround had investigated the possible use of the
  Differential Analyser\r\nfor ballistic computations. The machine was used to compute
  numerous\r\ntrajectories including a set sufficient for the preparation of a complete\r\nrange
  table. (t was also tested on interior ballistic problems. A careful\r\n study and
  evaluation of the results of this investigation led to the\r\nfollowing conclusions:\r\n\t
  Such a machine could be built at Aberdeen Proving Ground.\r\n\t  The machine could
  perform various kinds of ballistic computations\r\nwith the necessary accuracy.\r\n\r\n\t
  \ Operation and maintenance would require no unusual skill.\r\n\t  The speed of
  the machine was such that it would insure greatly\r\nincreased output of work by
  the Ballistic Section in any emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ord. Mono.

  \tIt could perform routine work at a smaller total expenditure of\r\nfunds.\r\n\t
  \tIts use in the preparation of range tables would replace numerous\r\ncomplicated
  and indirect methods by simple, uniform and direct process.\r\n\t \tIts use would
  permit the investigation of various problems, the\r\nsolution of which was necessary
  to any advance in ballistic theory or\r\npractice but which previously could not
  be studied because existing methods\r\nrequired a prohibitive amount of computing
  labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIt was decided to use the Bush Differential Analyser at Aberdeen
  Proving \r\nGround\r\nand its installation was completed in 1935. After final adjustment
  and \r\ntrials it\r\nwas used in the computation of two firing tables. These were
  completed with\r\ngratifying results by mid 1936.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe Bush Differential
  Analyser, an analog device, was installed under the\r\ndirection of Major James
  Guion, who was in charge of the Ballistic \r\nComputing Section\r\nat Aberdeen Proving
  Ground at that time. Major Guion had been quick to \r\nrealize the\r\nvalue of this
  continuous variable calculator to the Computational needs of \r\nthe\r\nOrdnance
  Department. The Availability   of this machine and the \r\nexperience that\r\nwas
  gained in its use were invaluable to the Ordnance Department during the \r\ncrucial\r\ntransition
  period prior to America's entry into World War 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe analyser installed
  at APG had ten integrating units and provisions for\r\ntwo input and two output
  tables. However, despite its value\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ord. Mono. 1961, CHAPTER

  important mechanical aid to computation it had certain limitations. The \r\ntorque\r\namplifier,
  for example, although simple in mechanical design, frequently \r\nfailed\r\ntoward
  the end of a long trajectory run with the loss of the preceding \r\ncomputation\r\nand
  an appreciable delay associated with its repair. This type of failure \r\nand the\r\ninterference
  that it caused with the carrying out of computations at the \r\nBallistic\r\nResearch
  Laboratory led to extensive study to overcome this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAt the
  outbreak of World War II in Europe the officer in charge of ballistic\r\ncomputations
  at APG was. Lt. P. N. Gillon. He immediately recognized the \r\nimmensity of\r\nthe
  task that would fall upon the Ordnance Department in the event of \r\nUnited States\r\nparticipation
  in the war and this prompted him to seek both marked \r\nimprovement in\r\nmechanical
  aids to computation and augmented facilities for its \r\naccomplishment. A\r\nnumber
  of very important things were undertaken to accomplish this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe
  Moore School of Electrical Engineering of the University of \r\nPennsylvania had\r\na
  Bush Differential Analyser of somewhat larger capacity than the one at \r\nAberdeen\r\nProving
  Ground. It had fourteen integrating units instead of ten. Therefore \r\nthe\r\nOrdnance
  Department awarded a contract to the University of Pennsylvania \r\nfor the\r\nutilization
  of this device. Several additional contracts were later awarded \r\nto the\r\nUniversity
  to carry out different phases of the increasingly important role \r\nwhich it\r\nwas
  to play in the computation activities of the Ordnance Department during \r\nthe
  war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ord. Mono. 1961, CHAPTER I, starting page 016\r\n

  Gillon, in his capacity as officer in charge of ballistic\r\ncomputations, conferred
  frequently with Dean Pender, Professor Brainerd, \r\nand their\r\nassociates at
  the Moore School in order to effect proper coordination of the\r\ncomputational
  work at the two localities, Philadelphia and Aberdeen. There \r\nwas a\r\nvery talented
  group at the Moore School under the direction of Professor \r\nBrainerd\r\nand as
  a result of Lt. Gillon's discussions with them Assistant Professor \r\nWeygand\r\nundertook
  to develop an electronic torque amplifier to replace the \r\nmechanical\r\ntorque
  amplifiers on the Bush Differential Analysers. This work was \r\neminently\r\nsuccessful
  and, in addition, photoelectric followers were developed by the \r\nMoore\r\nSchool
  group for both the input and output tables of the analyser. As a \r\nresult of\r\nthese
  accomplishments the productive capacity of the analysers at both the \r\nMoore\r\nSchool
  and Aberdeen Proving Ground were enhanced by at least an order of\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tDuring
  World War II the Bush Differential Analyser was used primarily to\r\ncompute trajectories
  for firing tables and to prepare trajectory charts for \r\nuse with\r\nUT fuzes.
  The machine could compute a 60-second trajectory in about 15 \r\nminutes,\r\nwhereas
  a human operator using a desk calculator required about 20 hours to \r\nperform\r\nthe
  same computation. Its value to the Ordnance Department during the war \r\nyears
  was\r\ntremendous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe next major development, prior to the advent
  of the high-speed electronic\r\nautomatic computer, came in 1944 when Howard Aiken,
  in cooperation with \r\nsome IBM\r\nengineers and some graduate students at Harvard
  University, completed the \r\nMark I\r\nRelay Computer, also called the Automatic
  \ Sequence-Controlled Calculator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ord. Mono. 1961,

  \r\n\r\n\r\n\tThis machine performed thousands of calculating steps, one after another,\r\naccording
  to a scheme fixed ahead of time. Its individual operations were\r\nautomatic, once
  the punched tape fixing the chain of operations had been \r\nput on\r\nthe machine,
  and it was sequence-controlled, since control over the \r\nsequence of\r\nits operations
  was built into the machine.\r\n\tThe principle of operation of the Mark I Relay
  Computer was \r\nelectromechanical.\r\nIt combined the two applications of the concept
  of state, that is, the \r\ninformation\r\nfor processing was represented by patterns
  of open and closed relays (like \r\nthe\r\npatterns of holes and no holes which
  Babbage used).\r\n\tAlthough the machine was efficient, fast, and capable of solving
  a variety\r\nof problems its speed could not approach that of the electronic computer,
  \r\nwhich\r\nis the next state in the development of computers and the subject of
  this\r\nmonograph. Nevertheless, it holds a permanent place in the history of \r\ndevelopment\r\nof
  calculating machines, since it was the first automatic machine to be\r\ncompleted.
  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   BRL at APG used two types of relay computers during 1947-1954.
  Two \r\nIBM Relay\r\nCalculators were used for a short time but were not successful.
  Two Bell \r\nRelay\r\nComputers were used. They were accurate, but slow and required
  expert \r\nmaintenance.\r\nOust and humidity adversely affected their operation.
  However many useful \r\nresults were\r\nobtained from the twin Bell Relay Computers
  during many years of successful \r\noperation.\r\nOne good feature of the Bell Relay
  Machines was that they would run 16 hours\r\novernight, unattended. A problem regularly
  would be placed on the computer \r\nat 4:00 PM.\r\nThe next morning, arriving operating
  personnel would find the problem \r\nsolved and the\r\nmachine waiting, or the machine
  still feverishly running the problem to a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  Ord. Mono.

  conclusion. Many times, if it was felt that the machines would \r\ncomplete\r\na
  problem during the night, a new problem was set before the machine for it \r\nto\r\ntackle
  until personnel arrived the next morning. This mode of operation \r\nincreased\r\nthe
  productivity of the computers with a minimum of personnel. Of course, \r\nonce in\r\na
  while a dirty relay would cause a stoppage, for the Bell A and the Bell B \r\nwould\r\neither
  run without error or not run at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  Go \tforward -> next
