  Grammy Award-winning cellist Yo-Yo Ma and a group of musicians gave a special presentation to students at the Indiana University School of Global and International Studies this morning about art and its connection to economics and culture. Ma gave the free talk and performance along with six other performers in a program titled “Musical Perspectives on Culture.”
- |
  Ma and his ensemble mixed live performance with a discussion of the music’s meaning for students and others who filled the auditorium of the new Global and International Studies Building. The musicians performed six musical selections from a variety of cultural influences, composers and time periods. Ma asked his audience to open themselves to hearing what is in the music, saying that the arts and humanities require a “childlike wonder.”
- |
  “Childlike wonder is essential for musicians,” Ma said. “They require the courage to be vulnerable and the capacity to wonder. That leads us to innovation and invention.”
- |

- |
  Such wonder with the arts, he said, can bring solutions to bear on the world’s most difficult problems.
- |
  “We are tempted to consider solutions in very narrow political or economic terms,” Ma said. “It is openness that brings opportunity.”
- |
  The IU Auditorium is hosting the world-premiere performance of Ma’s newest collaborative concert series, “Musical Perspectives on the Cultures of BRIC: a Silkroad Collaboration,” at 8 p.m. today. The concert itself focuses on music of the “Big Four” countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China. They are called the “BRIC” countries by economists and are considered to be in similar stages of new economic development. The BRIC concert series expands on how changing economic times can create unusual conflicts when aligning rich cultural history and tradition with modern aesthetics.
- |
  Ma and the members of his ensemble performed part of the program for IU School of Global and International Studies students and spoke about the roots of the music. Ma, Kathryn Stott, Sérgio and Odair Assad, Johnny Gandelsman, Wu Tong and Sandeep Das have been in Bloomington rehearsing for their debut show and the upcoming tour.
- |
  “Ma and the Silk Ensemble travel the world to celebrate both our differences and our commonalities as global citizens,” IU SGIS Dean Lee Feinstein told Ma in an introduction to the group. “We at SGIS and Indiana University are immensely honored to form a section of the glorious world orchestra you’ve devoted your life to assembling.”
- |

  Throughout the discussion, Ma dissected the music for his audience, discussing how slight accents on certain beats and notes comprise the sound of a particular cultural influence. He noted in the opening piece an accent common in Brazilian music. In a piece by the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky, he pointed out that moving a note by an eighth of a beat gave it a wistful, Russian sound. Other pieces, Ma explained, combined American tradition with North Indian music and African rhythms with jazz.
- |
  Such combinations illustrate the openness Ma said we should bring to listening, allowing the cultural influences to come through. He said he first discovered this when he was a child, something that calmed his fears as his family moved from France to the U.S. On a larger scale, he said such openness can have a positive effect as the world goes through change.
- |
  “Openness goes hand-in-hand with empathy,” Ma said, noting that a piece the ensemble performed was 1,800 years old but still felt contemporary. “That’s how culture helps us transcend distance both in space and time. Taken together, wonder, openness and empathy have an incredibly powerful effect on culture. They’re an antidote to fear and darkness.”

  Award-winning cellist Yo-Yo Ma and a group of musicians gave a special presentation
  to students at the Indiana University School of Global and International Studies
  this morning about art and its connection to economics and culture. Ma gave the
  free talk and performance along with six other performers in a program titled “Musical
  Perspectives on Culture.”\nMa and his ensemble mixed live performance with a discussion
  of the music’s meaning for students and others who filled the auditorium of the
  new Global and International Studies Building. The musicians performed six musical
  selections from a variety of cultural influences, composers and time periods. Ma
  asked his audience to open themselves to hearing what is in the music, saying that
  the arts and humanities require a “childlike wonder.”\n“Childlike wonder is essential
  for musicians,” Ma said. “They require the courage to be vulnerable and the capacity
  to wonder. That leads us to innovation and invention.”\nMa talks about world music

  the arts, he said, can bring solutions to bear on the world’s most difficult problems.\n“We
  are tempted to consider solutions in very narrow political or economic terms,” Ma
  said. “It is openness that brings opportunity.”\nThe IU Auditorium is hosting the
  world-premiere performance of Ma’s newest collaborative concert series, “Musical
  Perspectives on the Cultures of BRIC: a Silkroad Collaboration,” at 8 p.m. today.
  The concert itself focuses on music of the “Big Four” countries of Brazil, Russia,
  India and China. They are called the “BRIC” countries by economists and are considered
  to be in similar stages of new economic development. The BRIC concert series expands
  on how changing economic times can create unusual conflicts when aligning rich cultural
  history and tradition with modern aesthetics.\nMa and the members of his ensemble
  performed part of the program for IU School of Global and International Studies
  students and spoke about the roots of the music. Ma, Kathryn Stott, Sérgio and Odair
  Assad, Johnny Gandelsman, Wu Tong and Sandeep Das have been in Bloomington rehearsing
  for their debut show and the upcoming tour.\n“Ma and the Silk Ensemble travel the
  world to celebrate both our differences and our commonalities as global citizens,”
  IU SGIS Dean Lee Feinstein told Ma in an introduction to the group. “We at SGIS
  and Indiana University are immensely honored to form a section of the glorious world
  orchestra you’ve devoted your life to assembling.”\nMa chats with IU SGIS Dean Lee

  dissected the music for his audience, discussing how slight accents on certain beats
  and notes comprise the sound of a particular cultural influence. He noted in the
  opening piece an accent common in Brazilian music. In a piece by the Russian composer
  Igor Stravinsky, he pointed out that moving a note by an eighth of a beat gave it
  a wistful, Russian sound. Other pieces, Ma explained, combined American tradition
  with North Indian music and African rhythms with jazz.\nSuch combinations illustrate
  the openness Ma said we should bring to listening, allowing the cultural influences
  to come through. He said he first discovered this when he was a child, something
  that calmed his fears as his family moved from France to the U.S. On a larger scale,
  he said such openness can have a positive effect as the world goes through change.\n“Openness
  goes hand-in-hand with empathy,” Ma said, noting that a piece the ensemble performed
  was 1,800 years old but still felt contemporary. “That’s how culture helps us transcend
  distance both in space and time. Taken together, wonder, openness and empathy have
  an incredibly powerful effect on culture. They’re an antidote to fear and darkness.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags:
