  this provocative book, Douglas Candland shows that as we begin to understand the
  way animals and non-speaking humans \"think,\" we hold up a mirror of sorts to our
  own mental world, and gain profound insights into human nature. Weaving together
  diaries, contemporary newspaper accounts, and his own enlightening commentary, Candland
  brings to life a series of extraordinary stories. He begins with a look at past
  efforts to civilize feral children. We meet Victor, the Wild Boy of Aveyron, now
  famous as the subject of a Truffaut film; Kaspar Hauser, raised in a cell, civilized,
  and then assassinated; and the Wolf Girls of India, found early this century huddled
  among wolf pups in a forest den (they were originally believed to be ghosts by superstitious
  villagers, who nearly shot them as they were being captured). In each case, it was
  hoped that the study of these children would help clarify the age-old nature/nurture
  debate, but, as Candland shows, so much of the information \"revealed\" was really
  only a projection of beliefs previously held by the investigating scientists. Candland
  then turns to \"clever animals.\" We learn how the investigation of \"Clever Hans,\"
  the German horse who could calculate square roots, proved to be a first step in
  the direction of behaviorism (researchers found that Hans was being tipped off by
  the subtle and unwitting body language of his owner and other observers, who would
  bend almost imperceptibly at the waist with every hoof beat, and stand erect when
  the correct count was reached). And Candland discusses the many attempts to communicate
  with our closest neighbor, the apes. We read of Richard Lynch Garner''s 1892 experiment
  living with chimpanzees in Gabon (he taught one to say the French word \"feu\"),
  and of Gua, raised by W.N. and L.A. Kellogg alongside their own son Donald, and
  of the latest successes of teaching sign language to such precocious apes as Sarah,
  Sherman, Austin, and Koko. Throughout, Candland illuminates the boldest and most
  intriguing efforts yet to extend our world to that of our fellow creatures. And
  he shows that, in the end, our effort to \"make contact\" is a reflection of the
  way in which we as a species create and order our universe. Humans have long shown
  a wish to connect with the silent minds around them. In assembling and interpreting
  the compelling tales in this book, Candland offers us a new understanding not only
  of the animal kingdom, but of the very nature of humanity, and our place in the
  great chain of being.","my_library_url":"https://www.google.com/accounts/Login?service=print\u0026continue=https://books.google.com/books%3Fop%3Dlibrary%26ie%3DISO-8859-1\u0026hl=en","is_magazine":false,"is_public_domain":false},{"enableUserFeedbackUI":true,"pseudocontinuous":true,"asyncAdsEnabled":true,"currentVersion":"_a7c07564689f9256ef5d5e0a582d7d08","maxPrintablePages":20,"enableEmbedding":true,"addVol2CollectionBaseUrl":"https://books.google.com/books?op=add\u0026ie=ISO-8859-1\u0026sig=ACfU3U0o-bzqBJF_z1_LIiwNQOsoqPvqrg\u0026id=RYG_CAWZZ4sC","removeVolFromCollectionBaseUrl":"https://books.google.com/books?op=remove\u0026ie=ISO-8859-1\u0026sig=ACfU3U1Q2ctSrpWahMF6IArol9xso62Kjw\u0026id=RYG_CAWZZ4sC","enableFeedbackQuality":false,"enableP13n":true,"enablePlusOne":true,"purchaseHelpUrl":"https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/179845","is_cobrand":false,"sign_in_url":"https://www.google.com/accounts/Login?service=print\u0026continue=https://books.google.com/books%3Fid%3DRYG_CAWZZ4sC%26pg%3DPA296%26dq%3Dkoko%2Bgorilla%2Boperant%2Bconditioning%26hl%3Den\u0026hl=en"},{"page":[{"pid":"PA296","highlights":[{"X":80,"Y":63,"W":44,"H":11},{"X":128,"Y":60,"W":74,"H":14},{"X":132,"Y":92,"W":32,"H":11},{"X":158,"Y":237,"W":32,"H":10},{"X":316,"Y":238,"W":36,"H":14},{"X":206,"Y":253,"W":37,"H":14},{"X":217,"Y":318,"W":32,"H":10},{"X":273,"Y":366,"W":32,"H":10},{"X":404,"Y":398,"W":31,"H":10},{"X":423,"Y":414,"W":36,"H":14},{"X":264,"Y":798,"W":31,"H":10}],"flags":8,"order":316,"vq":"koko

  this provocative book, Douglas Candland shows that as we begin to understand the
  way animals and non-speaking humans \"think,\" we hold up a mirror of sorts to our
  own mental world, and gain profound insights into human nature. Weaving together
  diaries, contemporary newspaper accounts, and his own enlightening commentary, Candland
  brings to life a series of extraordinary stories. He begins with a look at past
  efforts to civilize feral children. We meet Victor, the Wild Boy of Aveyron, now
  famous as the subject of a Truffaut film; Kaspar Hauser, raised in a cell, civilized,
  and then assassinated; and the Wolf Girls of India, found early this century huddled
  among wolf pups in a forest den (they were originally believed to be ghosts by superstitious
  villagers, who nearly shot them as they were being captured). In each case, it was
  hoped that the study of these children would help clarify the age-old nature/nurture
  debate, but, as Candland shows, so much of the information \"revealed\" was really
  only a projection of beliefs previously held by the investigating scientists. Candland
  then turns to \"clever animals.\" We learn how the investigation of \"Clever Hans,\"
  the German horse who could calculate square roots, proved to be a first step in
  the direction of behaviorism (researchers found that Hans was being tipped off by
  the subtle and unwitting body language of his owner and other observers, who would
  bend almost imperceptibly at the waist with every hoof beat, and stand erect when
  the correct count was reached). And Candland discusses the many attempts to communicate
  with our closest neighbor, the apes. We read of Richard Lynch Garner''s 1892 experiment
  living with chimpanzees in Gabon (he taught one to say the French word \"feu\"),
  and of Gua, raised by W.N. and L.A. Kellogg alongside their own son Donald, and
  of the latest successes of teaching sign language to such precocious apes as Sarah,
  Sherman, Austin, and Koko. Throughout, Candland illuminates the boldest and most
  intriguing efforts yet to extend our world to that of our fellow creatures. And
  he shows that, in the end, our effort to \"make contact\" is a reflection of the
  way in which we as a species create and order our universe. Humans have long shown
  a wish to connect with the silent minds around them. In assembling and interpreting
  the compelling tales in this book, Candland offers us a new understanding not only
  of the animal kingdom, but of the very nature of humanity, and our place in the
