- |2
                                   the goal of the immigration protections for battered immigrants included in the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 [Pub. L. 103–322, title IV, see Tables for classification] was to remove immigration laws as a barrier that kept battered immigrant women and children locked in abusive relationships;

- |2
                              “(2)
- |2
                                   providing battered immigrant women and children who were experiencing domestic violence at home with protection against deportation allows them to obtain protection orders against their abusers and frees them to cooperate with law enforcement and prosecutors in criminal cases brought against their abusers and the abusers of their children without fearing that the abuser will retaliate by withdrawing or threatening withdrawal of access to an immigration benefit under the abuser’s control; and

- |2
                                   there are several groups of battered immigrant women and children who do not have access to the immigration protections of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 which means that their abusers are virtually immune from prosecution because their victims can be deported as a result of action by their abusers and the Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot offer them protection no matter how compelling their case under existing law.

- |2
                                       Immigrant women and children are often targeted to be victims of crimes committed against them in the United States, including rape, torture, kidnaping, trafficking, incest, domestic violence, sexual assault, female genital mutilation, forced prostitution, involuntary servitude, being held hostage or being criminally restrained.

- |2
                                       The purpose of this section [amending this section and sections 1182, 1184, 1255, and 1367 of this title] is to create a new nonimmigrant visa classification that will strengthen the ability of law enforcement agencies to detect, investigate, and prosecute cases of domestic violence, sexual assault, trafficking of aliens, and other crimes described in section 101(a)(15)(U)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii)] committed against aliens, while offering protection to victims of such offenses in keeping with the humanitarian interests of the United States. This visa will encourage law enforcement officials to better serve immigrant crime victims and to prosecute crimes committed against aliens.

- |2
                                  “(B)
- |2
                                       Creating a new nonimmigrant visa classification will facilitate the reporting of crimes to law enforcement officials by trafficked, exploited, victimized, and abused aliens who are not in lawful immigration status. It also gives law enforcement officials a means to regularize the status of cooperating individuals during investigations or prosecutions. Providing temporary legal status to aliens who have been severely victimized by criminal activity also comports with the humanitarian interests of the United States.

(a)(15)(H)(ii) of this section or as a spouse or minor child of such worker, and has resided continuously in the Virgin Islands since June 30, 1975, the Attorney General may adjust the status of such nonimmigrant alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, provided certain conditions are met, and such alien is not to be deported for failure to maintain nonimmigrant status until final action is taken on the alien’s application for adjustment, see section 2(a), (b) of Pub. L. 97–271, set out as a note under section 1255 of this title.

- |2
                  Ex. Ord. No. 12711, Apr. 11, 1990, 55 F.R. 13897, provided:
- |2
                  By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, the Attorney General and the Secretary of State are hereby ordered to exercise their authority, including that under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101–1557), as follows:
- |2
                  Section 1. The Attorney General is directed to take any steps necessary to defer until January 1, 1994, the enforced departure of all nationals of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and their dependents who were in the United States on or after June 5, 1989, up to and including the date of this order (hereinafter “such PRC nationals”).
- |2
                  Sec. 2. The Secretary of State and the Attorney General are directed to take all steps necessary with respect to such PRC nationals (a) to waive through January 1, 1994, the requirement of a valid passport and (b) to process and provide necessary documents, both within the United States and at U.S. consulates overseas, to facilitate travel across the borders of other nations and reentry into the United States in the same status such PRC nationals had upon departure.
- |2
                  Sec. 3. The Secretary of State and the Attorney General are directed to provide the following protections:
- |2
                  (a) irrevocable waiver of the 2-year home country residence requirement that may be exercised until January 1, 1994, for such PRC nationals;
- |2
                  (b) maintenance of lawful status for purposes of adjustment of status or change of nonimmigrant status for such PRC nationals who were in lawful status at any time on or after June 5, 1989, up to and including the date of this order;
- |2
                  (c) authorization for employment of such PRC nationals through January 1, 1994; and
- |2
                  (d) notice of expiration of nonimmigrant status (if applicable) rather than the institution of deportation proceedings, and explanation of options available for such PRC nationals eligible for deferral of enforced departure whose nonimmigrant status has expired.
- |2
                  Sec. 4. The Secretary of State and the Attorney General are directed to provide for enhanced consideration under the immigration laws for individuals from any country who express a fear of persecution upon return to their country related to that country’s policy of forced abortion or coerced sterilization, as implemented by the Attorney General’s regulation effective January 29, 1990.
- |2
                  Sec. 5. The Attorney General is directed to ensure that the Immigration and Naturalization Service finalizes and makes public its position on the issue of training for individuals in F–1 visa status and on the issue of reinstatement into lawful nonimmigrant status of such PRC nationals who have withdrawn their applications for asylum.
- |2
                  Sec. 6. The Departments of Justice and State are directed to consider other steps to assist such PRC nationals in their efforts to utilize the protections that I have extended pursuant to this order.
- |2
                  Sec. 7. This order shall be effective immediately.

              Deterring Illegal Immigration
- |2
                  Memorandum of President of the United States, Feb. 7, 1995, 60 F.R. 7885, provided:
- |2
                  Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
- |2
                  It is a fundamental right and duty for a nation to protect the integrity of its borders and its laws. This Administration shall stand firm against illegal immigration and the continued abuse of our immigration laws. By closing the back door to illegal immigration, we will continue to open the front door to legal immigrants.
- |2
                  My Administration has moved swiftly to reverse the course of a decade of failed immigration policies. Our initiatives have included increasing overall Border personnel by over 50 percent since 1993. We also are strengthening worksite enforcement and work authorization verification to deter employment of illegal aliens. Asylum rules have been reformed to end abuse by those falsely claiming asylum, while offering protection to those in genuine fear of persecution. We are cracking down on smugglers of illegal aliens and reforming criminal alien deportation for quicker removal. And we are the first Administration to obtain funding to reimburse States for a share of the costs of incarcerating criminal illegal aliens.
- |2
                  While we already are doing more to stem the flow of illegal immigration than has any previous Administration, more remains to be done. In conjunction with the Administration’s unprecedented budget proposal to support immigration initiatives, this directive provides a blueprint of policies and priorities for this Administration’s continuing work to curtail illegal immigration. With its focus on strong border deterrence backed up by effective worksite enforcement, removal of criminal and other deportable aliens and assistance to states, this program protects the security of our borders, our jobs and our communities for all Americans—citizens and legal immigrants alike.

              COMPREHENSIVE BORDER CONTROL STRATEGY
- |2
                  A. Deterring Illegal Immigration At Our Borders
- "                \n"
- |2
                  I have directed the Attorney General to move expeditiously toward full implementation of our comprehensive border control strategy, including efforts at the southwest border. To support sustained long-term strengthening of our deterrence capacity, the Administration shall seek funding to add new Border Patrol agents to reach the goal of at least 7,000 agents protecting our borders by the year 2000.
- |2
                    Flexible Border Response Capacity
- "                \n"
- |2
                  To further this strategy, the Department of Justice shall implement the capacity to respond to emerging situations anywhere along our national borders to deter buildups of illegal border crossers, smuggling operations, or other developing problems.
- |2
                    Strategic Use of High Technology
- "                \n"
- |2
                  Through the strategic use of sensors, night scopes, helicopters, light planes, all-terrain vehicles, fingerprinting and automated recordkeeping, we have freed many Border Patrol agents from long hours of bureaucratic tasks and increased the effectiveness of these highly-trained personnel. Because these tools are essential for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to do its job, I direct the Attorney General to accelerate to the greatest extent possible their utilization and enhancement to support implementation of our deterrence strategy.
- |2
                    Strong Enforcement Against Repeat Illegal Crossers
- "                \n"
- |2
                  The Department of Justice shall assess the effectiveness of efforts underway to deter repeat illegal crossers, such as fingerprinting and dedicating prosecution resources to enforce the new prosecution authority provided by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 [Pub. L. 103–322, see Tables for classification].
- |2
                  The Department of Justice shall determine whether accelerated expansion of these techniques to additional border sectors is warranted.
- |2
                  B. Deterring Alien Smuggling
- "                \n"
- |2
                  This Administration has had success deterring large ship-based smuggling directly to United States shores. In response, smugglers are testing new routes and tactics. Our goal: similar success in choking off these attempts by adjusting our anti-smuggling initiatives to anticipate shifting smuggling patterns.
- |2
                  To meet new and continuing challenges posed along transport routes and in foreign locations by smuggling organizations, we will augment diplomatic and enforcement resources at overseas locations to work with host governments, and increase related intelligence gathering efforts.
- |2
                  The Departments of State and Justice, in cooperation with other relevant agencies, will report to the National Security Council within 30 days on the structure of interagency coordination to achieve these objectives.
- |2
                  Congressional action will be important to provide U.S. law enforcement agencies with needed authority to deal with international smuggling operations. I will propose that the Congress pass legislation providing wiretap authority for investigation of alien smuggling cases and providing authorization to seize the assets of groups engaged in trafficking in human cargo.
- |2
                  In addition, I will propose legislation to give the Attorney General authority to implement procedures for expedited exclusion to deal with large flows of undocumented migrants, smuggling operations, and other extraordinary migration situations.
- |2
                  C. Visa Overstay Deterrence
- "                \n"
- |2
                  Nearly half of this country’s illegal immigrants come into the country legally and then stay after they are required by law to depart, often using fraudulent documentation. No Administration has ever made a serious effort to identify and deport these individuals. This Administration is committed to curtailing this form of illegal immigration.
- |2
                  Therefore, relevant departments and agencies are directed to review their policies and practices to identify necessary reforms to curtail visa overstayers and to enhance investigations and prosecution of those who fraudulently produce or misuse passports, visas, and other travel related documents. Recommendations for administrative initiatives and legislative reform shall be presented to the White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration by June 30, 1995.
- "            \n"
- |2
              REDUCING THE MAGNET OF WORK OPPORTUNITIES, WORKSITE ENFORCEMENT, AND DETERRENCE
- |2
                  Border deterrence cannot succeed if the lure of jobs in the United States remains. Therefore, a second major component of the Administration’s deterrence strategy is to toughen worksite enforcement and employer sanctions. Employers who hire illegal immigrants not only obtain unfair competitive advantage over law-abiding employers, their unlawful use of illegal immigrants suppresses wages and working conditions for our country’s legal workers. Our strategy, which targets enforcement efforts at employers and industries that historically have relied upon employment of illegal immigrants, will not only strengthen deterrence of illegal immigration, but better protect American workers and businesses that do not hire illegal immigrants.
- |2
                  Central to this effort is an effective, nondiscriminatory means of verifying the employment authorization of all new employees. The Administration fully supports the recommendation of the Commission on Legal Immigration Reform to create pilot projects to test various techniques for improving workplace verification, including a computer database test to validate a new worker’s social security number for work authorization purposes. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and Social Security Administration are directed to establish, implement, monitor, and review the pilots and provide me with an interim report on the progress of this program by March 1, 1996.
- |2
                  In addition, the INS is directed to finalize the Administration’s reduction of the number of authorized documents to support work verification for noncitizens. Concurrently, the Administration will seek further reduction legislatively in the number of documents that are acceptable for proving identity and work authorization. The Administration will improve the security of existing documents to be used for work authorization and seek increased penalties for immigration fraud, including fraudulent production and use of documents.
- |2
                  The Department of Labor shall intensify its investigations in industries with patterns of labor law violations that promote illegal immigration.
- |2
                  I also direct the Department of Labor, INS, and other relevant Federal agencies to expand their collaboration in cracking down on those who subvert fair competition by hiring illegal aliens. This may include increased Federal authority to confiscate assets that are the fruits of that unfair competition.
- |2
                  The White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration shall further examine the link between immigration and employment, including illegal immigration, and recommend to me other appropriate measures.
- "            \n"
- |2
              DETENTION AND REMOVAL OF DEPORTABLE ILLEGAL ALIENS
- |2
                  The Administration’s deterrence strategy includes strengthening the country’s detention and deportation capability. No longer will criminals and other high risk deportable aliens be released back into communities because of a shortage of detention space and ineffective deportation procedures.
- |2
                  A. Comprehensive Deportation Process Reform
- "                \n"
- |2
                  The Department of Justice, in consultation with other relevant agencies, shall develop a streamlined, fair, and effective procedure to expedite removal of deportable aliens. As necessary, additional legislative authority will be sought in this area. In addition, the Department of Justice shall increase its capacity to staff deportation and exclusion hearings to support these objectives.
- |2
                  B. National Detention and Removal Plan
- "                \n"
- |2
                  To address the shortage of local detention space for illegal aliens, the Administration shall devise a National Detention, Transportation, and Removal Policy that will permit use of detention space across the United States and improve the ability to remove individuals with orders of deportation. The Department of Justice, in consultation with other agencies as appropriate and working under the auspices of the White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration, shall finalize this plan by April 30, 1995.
- |2
                  The Administration will seek support and funding from the Congress for this plan and for our efforts to double the removal of illegal aliens with final orders of deportation.
- |2
                  C. Identification and Removal of Criminal Aliens
- "                \n"
- |2
                  The Institutional Hearing Program is successfully expediting deportation of incarcerated criminal aliens after they serve their sentences.
- |2
                  To further expedite removal of criminal aliens from this country and reduce costs to Federal and State governments, the Department of Justice is directed to develop an expanded program of verification of the immigration status of criminal aliens within our country’s prisons. In developing this program, the viability of expanding the work of the Law Enforcement Support Center should be assessed and all necessary steps taken to increase coordination and cooperative efforts with State, and local law enforcement officers in identification of criminal aliens.
- "            \n"
- |2
              TARGETED DETERRENCE AREAS
- |2
                  Many of the Administration’s illegal immigration enforcement initiatives are mutually reinforcing. For example, strong interior enforcement supports border control. While there have been efforts over the years at piecemeal cooperation, this Administration will examine, develop, and test a more comprehensive coordinated package of deterrence strategies in selected metropolitan areas by multiple Federal, State, and local agencies.
- |2
                  The White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration shall coordinate the development of this interagency and intergovernmental operation.
- "            \n"
- |2
              VERIFICATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS
- |2
                  The law denies most government benefits to illegal aliens. The government has a duty to assure that taxpayer-supported public assistance programs are not abused. As with work authorization, enforcement of eligibility requirements relies upon a credible system of verification. The INS, working with the White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration as appropriate, shall review means of improving the existing benefits verification program. In addition, we will seek new mechanisms—including increased penalties for false information used to qualify for benefits—to protect the integrity of public programs.
- "            \n"
- |2
              ANTI-DISCRIMINATION
- |2
                  Our efforts to combat illegal immigration must not violate the privacy and civil rights of legal immigrants and U.S. citizens. Therefore, I direct the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and other relevant Administration officials to vigorously protect our citizens and legal immigrants from immigration-related instances of discrimination and harassment. All illegal immigration enforcement measures shall be taken with due regard for the basic human rights of individuals and in accordance with our obligations under applicable international agreements.
- "            \n"
- |2
              ASSISTANCE TO STATES
- |2
                  States today face significant costs for services provided to illegal immigrants as a result of failed policies of the past. Deterring illegal immigration is the best long-term solution to protect States from growing costs for illegal immigration. This is the first Administration to address this primary responsibility squarely. We are targeting most of our Federal dollars to those initiatives that address the root causes that lead to increased burdens on States.
- |2
                  The Federal Government provides States with billions of dollars to provide for health care, education, and other services and benefits for immigrants. This Administration is proposing increases for immigration and immigration-related spending of 25 percent in 1996 compared to 1993 levels. In addition, this Administration is the first to obtain funding from the Congress to reimburse States for a share of the costs of incarcerated illegal aliens.
- |2
                  This Administration will continue to work with States to obtain more Federal help for certain State costs and will oppose inappropriate cost-shifting to the States.
- "            \n"
- |2
              INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
- |2
                  This Administration will continue to emphasize international cooperative efforts to address illegal immigration.
- |2
                  Pursuant to a Presidential Review Directive (PRD), the Department of State is now coordinating a study on United States policy toward international refugee and migration affairs. I hereby direct that, as part of that PRD process, this report to the National Security Council include the relationship of economic development and migration in the Western Hemisphere and, in particular, provide recommendations for further foreign economic policy measures to address causes of illegal immigration.
- |2
                  The Department of State shall coordinate an interagency effort to consider expanded arrangements with foreign governments for return of criminal and deportable aliens.
- |2
                  The Department of State also shall seek to negotiate readmission agreements for persons who could have sought asylum in the last country from which they arrived. Such agreements will take due regard of U.S. obligations under the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.
- |2
                  The Department of State further shall implement cooperative efforts with other nations receiving smuggled aliens or those used as transhipment points by smugglers. In particular, we will look to countries in our hemisphere to join us by denying their territory as bases for smuggling operations.
- |2
                  The Department of State shall initiate negotiations with foreign countries to secure authority for the United States Coast Guard to board source country vessels suspected of transporting smuggled aliens.
- |2
                  This directive shall be published in the Federal Register.

  the Attorney General and the Secretary of State are hereby ordered to exercise their
  authority, including that under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101–1557),
  as follows:Section 1. The Attorney General is directed to take any steps necessary
  to defer until January 1, 1994, the enforced departure of all nationals of the People’s
  Republic of China (PRC) and their dependents who were in the United States on or
  after June 5, 1989, up to and including the date of this order (hereinafter “such
  PRC nationals”).Sec. 2. The Secretary of State and the Attorney General are directed
  to take all steps necessary with respect to such PRC nationals (a) to waive through
  January 1, 1994, the requirement of a valid passport and (b) to process and provide
  necessary documents, both within the United States and at U.S. consulates overseas,
  to facilitate travel across the borders of other nations and reentry into the United
  States in the same status such PRC nationals had upon departure.Sec. 3. The Secretary
  of State and the Attorney General are directed to provide the following protections:(a)
  irrevocable waiver of the 2-year home country residence requirement that may be
  exercised until January 1, 1994, for such PRC nationals;(b) maintenance of lawful
  status for purposes of adjustment of status or change of nonimmigrant status for
  such PRC nationals who were in lawful status at any time on or after June 5, 1989,
  up to and including the date of this order;(c) authorization for employment of such
  PRC nationals through January 1, 1994; and(d) notice of expiration of nonimmigrant
  status (if applicable) rather than the institution of deportation proceedings, and
  explanation of options available for such PRC nationals eligible for deferral of
  enforced departure whose nonimmigrant status has expired.Sec. 4. The Secretary of
  State and the Attorney General are directed to provide for enhanced consideration
  under the immigration laws for individuals from any country who express a fear of
  persecution upon return to their country related to that country’s policy of forced
  abortion or coerced sterilization, as implemented by the Attorney General’s regulation
  effective January 29, 1990.Sec. 5. The Attorney General is directed to ensure that
  the Immigration and Naturalization Service finalizes and makes public its position
  on the issue of training for individuals in F–1 visa status and on the issue of
  reinstatement into lawful nonimmigrant status of such PRC nationals who have withdrawn
  their applications for asylum.Sec. 6. The Departments of Justice and State are directed
  to consider other steps to assist such PRC nationals in their efforts to utilize
  the protections that I have extended pursuant to this order.Sec. 7. This order shall
  be effective immediately.Memorandum of President of the United States, Feb. 7, 1995,
  60 F.R. 7885, provided:Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesIt
  is a fundamental right and duty for a nation to protect the integrity of its borders
  and its laws. This Administration shall stand firm against illegal immigration and
  the continued abuse of our immigration laws. By closing the back door to illegal
  immigration, we will continue to open the front door to legal immigrants.My Administration
  has moved swiftly to reverse the course of a decade of failed immigration policies.
  Our initiatives have included increasing overall Border personnel by over 50 percent
  since 1993. We also are strengthening worksite enforcement and work authorization
  verification to deter employment of illegal aliens. Asylum rules have been reformed
  to end abuse by those falsely claiming asylum, while offering protection to those
  in genuine fear of persecution. We are cracking down on smugglers of illegal aliens
  and reforming criminal alien deportation for quicker removal. And we are the first
  Administration to obtain funding to reimburse States for a share of the costs of
  incarcerating criminal illegal aliens.While we already are doing more to stem the
  flow of illegal immigration than has any previous Administration, more remains to
  be done. In conjunction with the Administration’s unprecedented budget proposal
  to support immigration initiatives, this directive provides a blueprint of policies
  and priorities for this Administration’s continuing work to curtail illegal immigration.
  With its focus on strong border deterrence backed up by effective worksite enforcement,
  removal of criminal and other deportable aliens and assistance to states, this program
  protects the security of our borders, our jobs and our communities for all Americans—citizens
  and legal immigrants alike.A. I have directed the Attorney General to move expeditiously
  toward full implementation of our comprehensive border control strategy, including
  efforts at the southwest border. To support sustained long-term strengthening of
  our deterrence capacity, the Administration shall seek funding to add new Border
  Patrol agents to reach the goal of at least 7,000 agents protecting our borders
  by the year 2000.  To further this strategy, the Department of Justice shall implement
  the capacity to respond to emerging situations anywhere along our national borders
  to deter buildups of illegal border crossers, smuggling operations, or other developing
  problems.  Through the strategic use of sensors, night scopes, helicopters, light
  planes, all-terrain vehicles, fingerprinting and automated recordkeeping, we have
  freed many Border Patrol agents from long hours of bureaucratic tasks and increased
  the effectiveness of these highly-trained personnel. Because these tools are essential
  for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to do its job, I direct the
  Attorney General to accelerate to the greatest extent possible their utilization
  and enhancement to support implementation of our deterrence strategy.  The Department
  of Justice shall assess the effectiveness of efforts underway to deter repeat illegal
  crossers, such as fingerprinting and dedicating prosecution resources to enforce
  the new prosecution authority provided by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement
  Act of 1994 [Pub. L. 103–322, see Tables for classification].The Department of Justice
  shall determine whether accelerated expansion of these techniques to additional
  border sectors is warranted.B. This Administration has had success deterring large
  ship-based smuggling directly to United States shores. In response, smugglers are
  testing new routes and tactics. Our goal: similar success in choking off these attempts
  by adjusting our anti-smuggling initiatives to anticipate shifting smuggling patterns.To
  meet new and continuing challenges posed along transport routes and in foreign locations
  by smuggling organizations, we will augment diplomatic and enforcement resources
  at overseas locations to work with host governments, and increase related intelligence
  gathering efforts.The Departments of State and Justice, in cooperation with other
  relevant agencies, will report to the National Security Council within 30 days on
  the structure of interagency coordination to achieve these objectives.Congressional
  action will be important to provide U.S. law enforcement agencies with needed authority
  to deal with international smuggling operations. I will propose that the Congress
  pass legislation providing wiretap authority for investigation of alien smuggling
  cases and providing authorization to seize the assets of groups engaged in trafficking
  in human cargo.In addition, I will propose legislation to give the Attorney General
  authority to implement procedures for expedited exclusion to deal with large flows
  of undocumented migrants, smuggling operations, and other extraordinary migration
  situations.C. Nearly half of this country’s illegal immigrants come into the country
  legally and then stay after they are required by law to depart, often using fraudulent
  documentation. No Administration has ever made a serious effort to identify and
  deport these individuals. This Administration is committed to curtailing this form
  of illegal immigration.Therefore, relevant departments and agencies are directed
  to review their policies and practices to identify necessary reforms to curtail
  visa overstayers and to enhance investigations and prosecution of those who fraudulently
  produce or misuse passports, visas, and other travel related documents. Recommendations
  for administrative initiatives and legislative reform shall be presented to the
  White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration by June 30, 1995.Border deterrence
  cannot succeed if the lure of jobs in the United States remains. Therefore, a second
  major component of the Administration’s deterrence strategy is to toughen worksite
  enforcement and employer sanctions. Employers who hire illegal immigrants not only
  obtain unfair competitive advantage over law-abiding employers, their unlawful use
  of illegal immigrants suppresses wages and working conditions for our country’s
  legal workers. Our strategy, which targets enforcement efforts at employers and
  industries that historically have relied upon employment of illegal immigrants,
  will not only strengthen deterrence of illegal immigration, but better protect American
  workers and businesses that do not hire illegal immigrants.Central to this effort
  is an effective, nondiscriminatory means of verifying the employment authorization
  of all new employees. The Administration fully supports the recommendation of the
  Commission on Legal Immigration Reform to create pilot projects to test various
  techniques for improving workplace verification, including a computer database test
  to validate a new worker’s social security number for work authorization purposes.
  The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and Social Security Administration
  are directed to establish, implement, monitor, and review the pilots and provide
  me with an interim report on the progress of this program by March 1, 1996.In addition,
  the INS is directed to finalize the Administration’s reduction of the number of
  authorized documents to support work verification for noncitizens. Concurrently,
  the Administration will seek further reduction legislatively in the number of documents
  that are acceptable for proving identity and work authorization. The Administration
  will improve the security of existing documents to be used for work authorization
  and seek increased penalties for immigration fraud, including fraudulent production
  and use of documents.The Department of Labor shall intensify its investigations
  in industries with patterns of labor law violations that promote illegal immigration.I
  also direct the Department of Labor, INS, and other relevant Federal agencies to
  expand their collaboration in cracking down on those who subvert fair competition
  by hiring illegal aliens. This may include increased Federal authority to confiscate
  assets that are the fruits of that unfair competition.The White House Interagency
  Working Group on Immigration shall further examine the link between immigration
  and employment, including illegal immigration, and recommend to me other appropriate
  measures.The Administration’s deterrence strategy includes strengthening the country’s
  detention and deportation capability. No longer will criminals and other high risk
  deportable aliens be released back into communities because of a shortage of detention
  space and ineffective deportation procedures.A. The Department of Justice, in consultation
  with other relevant agencies, shall develop a streamlined, fair, and effective procedure
  to expedite removal of deportable aliens. As necessary, additional legislative authority
  will be sought in this area. In addition, the Department of Justice shall increase
  its capacity to staff deportation and exclusion hearings to support these objectives.B.
  To address the shortage of local detention space for illegal aliens, the Administration
  shall devise a National Detention, Transportation, and Removal Policy that will
  permit use of detention space across the United States and improve the ability to
  remove individuals with orders of deportation. The Department of Justice, in consultation
  with other agencies as appropriate and working under the auspices of the White House
  Interagency Working Group on Immigration, shall finalize this plan by April 30,
  1995.The Administration will seek support and funding from the Congress for this
  plan and for our efforts to double the removal of illegal aliens with final orders
  of deportation.C. The Institutional Hearing Program is successfully expediting deportation
  of incarcerated criminal aliens after they serve their sentences.To further expedite
  removal of criminal aliens from this country and reduce costs to Federal and State
  governments, the Department of Justice is directed to develop an expanded program
  of verification of the immigration status of criminal aliens within our country’s
  prisons. In developing this program, the viability of expanding the work of the
  Law Enforcement Support Center should be assessed and all necessary steps taken
  to increase coordination and cooperative efforts with State, and local law enforcement
  officers in identification of criminal aliens.Many of the Administration’s illegal
  immigration enforcement initiatives are mutually reinforcing. For example, strong
  interior enforcement supports border control. While there have been efforts over
  the years at piecemeal cooperation, this Administration will examine, develop, and
  test a more comprehensive coordinated package of deterrence strategies in selected
  metropolitan areas by multiple Federal, State, and local agencies.The White House
  Interagency Working Group on Immigration shall coordinate the development of this
  interagency and intergovernmental operation.The law denies most government benefits
  to illegal aliens. The government has a duty to assure that taxpayer-supported public
  assistance programs are not abused. As with work authorization, enforcement of eligibility
  requirements relies upon a credible system of verification. The INS, working with
  the White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration as appropriate, shall review
  means of improving the existing benefits verification program. In addition, we will
  seek new mechanisms—including increased penalties for false information used to
  qualify for benefits—to protect the integrity of public programs.Our efforts to
  combat illegal immigration must not violate the privacy and civil rights of legal
  immigrants and U.S. citizens. Therefore, I direct the Attorney General, the Secretary
  of Health and Human Services, the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
  and other relevant Administration officials to vigorously protect our citizens and
  legal immigrants from immigration-related instances of discrimination and harassment.
  All illegal immigration enforcement measures shall be taken with due regard for
  the basic human rights of individuals and in accordance with our obligations under
  applicable international agreements.States today face significant costs for services
  provided to illegal immigrants as a result of failed policies of the past. Deterring
  illegal immigration is the best long-term solution to protect States from growing
  costs for illegal immigration. This is the first Administration to address this
  primary responsibility squarely. We are targeting most of our Federal dollars to
  those initiatives that address the root causes that lead to increased burdens on
  States.The Federal Government provides States with billions of dollars to provide
  for health care, education, and other services and benefits for immigrants. This
  Administration is proposing increases for immigration and immigration-related spending
  of 25 percent in 1996 compared to 1993 levels. In addition, this Administration
  is the first to obtain funding from the Congress to reimburse States for a share
  of the costs of incarcerated illegal aliens.This Administration will continue to
  work with States to obtain more Federal help for certain State costs and will oppose
  inappropriate cost-shifting to the States.This Administration will continue to emphasize
  international cooperative efforts to address illegal immigration.Pursuant to a Presidential
  Review Directive (PRD), the Department of State is now coordinating a study on United
  States policy toward international refugee and migration affairs. I hereby direct
  that, as part of that PRD process, this report to the National Security Council
  include the relationship of economic development and migration in the Western Hemisphere
  and, in particular, provide recommendations for further foreign economic policy
  measures to address causes of illegal immigration.The Department of State shall
  coordinate an interagency effort to consider expanded arrangements with foreign
  governments for return of criminal and deportable aliens.The Department of State
  also shall seek to negotiate readmission agreements for persons who could have sought
  asylum in the last country from which they arrived. Such agreements will take due
  regard of U.S. obligations under the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.The
  Department of State further shall implement cooperative efforts with other nations
  receiving smuggled aliens or those used as transhipment points by smugglers. In
  particular, we will look to countries in our hemisphere to join us by denying their
  territory as bases for smuggling operations.The Department of State shall initiate
  negotiations with foreign countries to secure authority for the United States Coast
  Guard to board source country vessels suspected of transporting smuggled aliens.This
  directive shall be published in the Federal Register.Pub. L. 104–208, div. C, § 1(c),

  period of one hundred and eighty days or more, regardless of whether the offense,
  or offenses, for which he has been confined were committed within or without such
  period;\n                    \n                    (8)\n                         one

  or claim of citizenship, or who registers to vote or votes in a Federal, State,
  or local election (including an initiative, recall, or referendum) in violation
  of a lawful restriction of such registration or voting to citizens, if each natural
  parent of the alien (or, in the case of an adopted alien, each adoptive parent of
  the alien) is or was a citizen (whether by birth or naturalization), the alien permanently
  resided in the United States prior to attaining the age of 16, and the alien reasonably
  believed at the time of such statement, claim, or violation that he or she was a
  citizen, no finding that the alien is, or was, not of good moral character may be
  made based on it.\n                \n                (g)\n                     For
  the purposes of this chapter any alien ordered deported or removed (whether before

  the source from which the expenses of his transportation were defrayed or of the
  place to which he departed.\n                \n                (h) For purposes
  of section 1182(a)(2)(E) of this title, the term “serious criminal offense” means—\n

  alien; and\n                    \n                    (2)\n                         the
  Secretary of Homeland Security shall, during the period the alien is in lawful temporary
  resident status under that subsection, grant the alien authorization to engage in
  employment in the United States and provide the alien with an “employment authorized”
  endorsement or other appropriate work permit.\n                    \n                \n

  section and sections 1182, 1184, 1255, and 1367 of this title] is to create a new
  nonimmigrant visa classification that will strengthen the ability of law enforcement
  agencies to detect, investigate, and prosecute cases of domestic violence, sexual
  assault, trafficking of aliens, and other crimes described in section 101(a)(15)(U)(iii)
  of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii)] committed
  against aliens, while offering protection to victims of such offenses in keeping
  with the humanitarian interests of the United States. This visa will encourage law
  enforcement officials to better serve immigrant crime victims and to prosecute crimes
  committed against aliens.\n                                \n                                “(B)\n

  will facilitate the reporting of crimes to law enforcement officials by trafficked,
  exploited, victimized, and abused aliens who are not in lawful immigration status.
  It also gives law enforcement officials a means to regularize the status of cooperating
  individuals during investigations or prosecutions. Providing temporary legal status
  to aliens who have been severely victimized by criminal activity also comports with
  the humanitarian interests of the United States.\n                                \n

  Respect to Nationals of People’s Republic of China\n                Ex. Ord. No.
  12711, Apr. 11, 1990, 55 F.R. 13897, provided:\n                By the authority
  vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America,
  the Attorney General and the Secretary of State are hereby ordered to exercise their
  authority, including that under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101–1557),
  as follows:\n                Section 1. The Attorney General is directed to take
  any steps necessary to defer until January 1, 1994, the enforced departure of all
  nationals of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and their dependents who were
  in the United States on or after June 5, 1989, up to and including the date of this
  order (hereinafter “such PRC nationals”).\n                Sec. 2. The Secretary
  of State and the Attorney General are directed to take all steps necessary with
  respect to such PRC nationals (a) to waive through January 1, 1994, the requirement
  of a valid passport and (b) to process and provide necessary documents, both within
  the United States and at U.S. consulates overseas, to facilitate travel across the
  borders of other nations and reentry into the United States in the same status such
  PRC nationals had upon departure.\n                Sec. 3. The Secretary of State
  and the Attorney General are directed to provide the following protections:\n                (a)
  irrevocable waiver of the 2-year home country residence requirement that may be
  exercised until January 1, 1994, for such PRC nationals;\n                (b) maintenance
  of lawful status for purposes of adjustment of status or change of nonimmigrant
  status for such PRC nationals who were in lawful status at any time on or after
  June 5, 1989, up to and including the date of this order;\n                (c) authorization
  for employment of such PRC nationals through January 1, 1994; and\n                (d)
  notice of expiration of nonimmigrant status (if applicable) rather than the institution

  eligible for deferral of enforced departure whose nonimmigrant status has expired.\n
  \               Sec. 4. The Secretary of State and the Attorney General are directed
  to provide for enhanced consideration under the immigration laws for individuals
  from any country who express a fear of persecution upon return to their country
  related to that country’s policy of forced abortion or coerced sterilization, as
  implemented by the Attorney General’s regulation effective January 29, 1990.\n                Sec.
  5. The Attorney General is directed to ensure that the Immigration and Naturalization
  Service finalizes and makes public its position on the issue of training for individuals
  in F–1 visa status and on the issue of reinstatement into lawful nonimmigrant status
  of such PRC nationals who have withdrawn their applications for asylum.\n                Sec.
  6. The Departments of Justice and State are directed to consider other steps to
  assist such PRC nationals in their efforts to utilize the protections that I have
  extended pursuant to this order.\n                Sec. 7. This order shall be effective
  immediately.\n                \n                    George Bush.\n                \n
  \           \n            Deterring Illegal Immigration\n                Memorandum
  of President of the United States, Feb. 7, 1995, 60 F.R. 7885, provided:\n                Memorandum
  for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies\n                It is a fundamental
  right and duty for a nation to protect the integrity of its borders and its laws.
  This Administration shall stand firm against illegal immigration and the continued
  abuse of our immigration laws. By closing the back door to illegal immigration,
  we will continue to open the front door to legal immigrants.\n                My
  Administration has moved swiftly to reverse the course of a decade of failed immigration
  policies. Our initiatives have included increasing overall Border personnel by over
  50 percent since 1993. We also are strengthening worksite enforcement and work authorization
  verification to deter employment of illegal aliens. Asylum rules have been reformed
  to end abuse by those falsely claiming asylum, while offering protection to those
  in genuine fear of persecution. We are cracking down on smugglers of illegal aliens
  and reforming criminal alien deportation for quicker removal. And we are the first
  Administration to obtain funding to reimburse States for a share of the costs of
  incarcerating criminal illegal aliens.\n                While we already are doing
  more to stem the flow of illegal immigration than has any previous Administration,
  more remains to be done. In conjunction with the Administration’s unprecedented
  budget proposal to support immigration initiatives, this directive provides a blueprint
  of policies and priorities for this Administration’s continuing work to curtail
  illegal immigration. With its focus on strong border deterrence backed up by effective
  worksite enforcement, removal of criminal and other deportable aliens and assistance
  to states, this program protects the security of our borders, our jobs and our communities
  for all Americans—citizens and legal immigrants alike.\n            \n            COMPREHENSIVE
  BORDER CONTROL STRATEGY\n                A. Deterring Illegal Immigration At Our
  Borders\n                \n                I have directed the Attorney General
  to move expeditiously toward full implementation of our comprehensive border control
  strategy, including efforts at the southwest border. To support sustained long-term
  strengthening of our deterrence capacity, the Administration shall seek funding
  to add new Border Patrol agents to reach the goal of at least 7,000 agents protecting
  our borders by the year 2000.\n                  Flexible Border Response Capacity\n
  \               \n                To further this strategy, the Department of Justice
  shall implement the capacity to respond to emerging situations anywhere along our
  national borders to deter buildups of illegal border crossers, smuggling operations,
  or other developing problems.\n                  Strategic Use of High Technology\n
  \               \n                Through the strategic use of sensors, night scopes,
  helicopters, light planes, all-terrain vehicles, fingerprinting and automated recordkeeping,
  we have freed many Border Patrol agents from long hours of bureaucratic tasks and
  increased the effectiveness of these highly-trained personnel. Because these tools
  are essential for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to do its job,
  I direct the Attorney General to accelerate to the greatest extent possible their
  utilization and enhancement to support implementation of our deterrence strategy.\n
  \                 Strong Enforcement Against Repeat Illegal Crossers\n                \n
  \               The Department of Justice shall assess the effectiveness of efforts
  underway to deter repeat illegal crossers, such as fingerprinting and dedicating
  prosecution resources to enforce the new prosecution authority provided by the Violent
  Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 [Pub. L. 103–322, see Tables for classification].\n
  \               The Department of Justice shall determine whether accelerated expansion
  of these techniques to additional border sectors is warranted.\n                B.
  Deterring Alien Smuggling\n                \n                This Administration
  has had success deterring large ship-based smuggling directly to United States shores.
  In response, smugglers are testing new routes and tactics. Our goal: similar success
  in choking off these attempts by adjusting our anti-smuggling initiatives to anticipate
  shifting smuggling patterns.\n                To meet new and continuing challenges
  posed along transport routes and in foreign locations by smuggling organizations,
  we will augment diplomatic and enforcement resources at overseas locations to work
  with host governments, and increase related intelligence gathering efforts.\n                The
  Departments of State and Justice, in cooperation with other relevant agencies, will
  report to the National Security Council within 30 days on the structure of interagency
  coordination to achieve these objectives.\n                Congressional action
  will be important to provide U.S. law enforcement agencies with needed authority
  to deal with international smuggling operations. I will propose that the Congress
  pass legislation providing wiretap authority for investigation of alien smuggling
  cases and providing authorization to seize the assets of groups engaged in trafficking
  in human cargo.\n                In addition, I will propose legislation to give
  the Attorney General authority to implement procedures for expedited exclusion to
  deal with large flows of undocumented migrants, smuggling operations, and other
  extraordinary migration situations.\n                C. Visa Overstay Deterrence\n
  \               \n                Nearly half of this country’s illegal immigrants
  come into the country legally and then stay after they are required by law to depart,
  often using fraudulent documentation. No Administration has ever made a serious
  effort to identify and deport these individuals. This Administration is committed
  to curtailing this form of illegal immigration.\n                Therefore, relevant
  departments and agencies are directed to review their policies and practices to
  identify necessary reforms to curtail visa overstayers and to enhance investigations
  and prosecution of those who fraudulently produce or misuse passports, visas, and
  other travel related documents. Recommendations for administrative initiatives and
  legislative reform shall be presented to the White House Interagency Working Group
  on Immigration by June 30, 1995.\n            \n            REDUCING THE MAGNET
  OF WORK OPPORTUNITIES, WORKSITE ENFORCEMENT, AND DETERRENCE\n                Border
  deterrence cannot succeed if the lure of jobs in the United States remains. Therefore,
  a second major component of the Administration’s deterrence strategy is to toughen
  worksite enforcement and employer sanctions. Employers who hire illegal immigrants
  not only obtain unfair competitive advantage over law-abiding employers, their unlawful
  use of illegal immigrants suppresses wages and working conditions for our country’s
  legal workers. Our strategy, which targets enforcement efforts at employers and
  industries that historically have relied upon employment of illegal immigrants,
  will not only strengthen deterrence of illegal immigration, but better protect American
  workers and businesses that do not hire illegal immigrants.\n                Central
  to this effort is an effective, nondiscriminatory means of verifying the employment
  authorization of all new employees. The Administration fully supports the recommendation
  of the Commission on Legal Immigration Reform to create pilot projects to test various
  techniques for improving workplace verification, including a computer database test
  to validate a new worker’s social security number for work authorization purposes.
  The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and Social Security Administration
  are directed to establish, implement, monitor, and review the pilots and provide
  me with an interim report on the progress of this program by March 1, 1996.\n                In
  addition, the INS is directed to finalize the Administration’s reduction of the
  number of authorized documents to support work verification for noncitizens. Concurrently,
  the Administration will seek further reduction legislatively in the number of documents
  that are acceptable for proving identity and work authorization. The Administration
  will improve the security of existing documents to be used for work authorization
  and seek increased penalties for immigration fraud, including fraudulent production
  and use of documents.\n                The Department of Labor shall intensify its
  investigations in industries with patterns of labor law violations that promote
  illegal immigration.\n                I also direct the Department of Labor, INS,
  and other relevant Federal agencies to expand their collaboration in cracking down
  on those who subvert fair competition by hiring illegal aliens. This may include
  increased Federal authority to confiscate assets that are the fruits of that unfair
  competition.\n                The White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration
  shall further examine the link between immigration and employment, including illegal
  immigration, and recommend to me other appropriate measures.\n            \n            DETENTION
  AND REMOVAL OF DEPORTABLE ILLEGAL ALIENS\n                The Administration’s deterrence
  strategy includes strengthening the country’s detention and deportation capability.
  No longer will criminals and other high risk deportable aliens be released back
  into communities because of a shortage of detention space and ineffective deportation
  procedures.\n                A. Comprehensive Deportation Process Reform\n                \n
  \               The Department of Justice, in consultation with other relevant agencies,
  shall develop a streamlined, fair, and effective procedure to expedite removal of
  deportable aliens. As necessary, additional legislative authority will be sought
  in this area. In addition, the Department of Justice shall increase its capacity
  to staff deportation and exclusion hearings to support these objectives.\n                B.
  National Detention and Removal Plan\n                \n                To address
  the shortage of local detention space for illegal aliens, the Administration shall
  devise a National Detention, Transportation, and Removal Policy that will permit
  use of detention space across the United States and improve the ability to remove
  individuals with orders of deportation. The Department of Justice, in consultation
  with other agencies as appropriate and working under the auspices of the White House
  Interagency Working Group on Immigration, shall finalize this plan by April 30,
  1995.\n                The Administration will seek support and funding from the
  Congress for this plan and for our efforts to double the removal of illegal aliens
  with final orders of deportation.\n                C. Identification and Removal
  of Criminal Aliens\n                \n                The Institutional Hearing
  Program is successfully expediting deportation of incarcerated criminal aliens after
  they serve their sentences.\n                To further expedite removal of criminal
  aliens from this country and reduce costs to Federal and State governments, the
  Department of Justice is directed to develop an expanded program of verification
  of the immigration status of criminal aliens within our country’s prisons. In developing
  this program, the viability of expanding the work of the Law Enforcement Support
  Center should be assessed and all necessary steps taken to increase coordination
  and cooperative efforts with State, and local law enforcement officers in identification
  of criminal aliens.\n            \n            TARGETED DETERRENCE AREAS\n                Many
  of the Administration’s illegal immigration enforcement initiatives are mutually
  reinforcing. For example, strong interior enforcement supports border control. While
  there have been efforts over the years at piecemeal cooperation, this Administration
  will examine, develop, and test a more comprehensive coordinated package of deterrence
  strategies in selected metropolitan areas by multiple Federal, State, and local
  agencies.\n                The White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration
  shall coordinate the development of this interagency and intergovernmental operation.\n
  \           \n            VERIFICATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS\n                The
  law denies most government benefits to illegal aliens. The government has a duty
  to assure that taxpayer-supported public assistance programs are not abused. As
  with work authorization, enforcement of eligibility requirements relies upon a credible
  system of verification. The INS, working with the White House Interagency Working
  Group on Immigration as appropriate, shall review means of improving the existing
  benefits verification program. In addition, we will seek new mechanisms—including
  increased penalties for false information used to qualify for benefits—to protect
  the integrity of public programs.\n            \n            ANTI-DISCRIMINATION\n
  \               Our efforts to combat illegal immigration must not violate the privacy
  and civil rights of legal immigrants and U.S. citizens. Therefore, I direct the
  Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Chair of the Equal
  Employment Opportunity Commission, and other relevant Administration officials to
  vigorously protect our citizens and legal immigrants from immigration-related instances
  of discrimination and harassment. All illegal immigration enforcement measures shall
  be taken with due regard for the basic human rights of individuals and in accordance
  with our obligations under applicable international agreements.\n            \n
  \           ASSISTANCE TO STATES\n                States today face significant
  costs for services provided to illegal immigrants as a result of failed policies
  of the past. Deterring illegal immigration is the best long-term solution to protect
  States from growing costs for illegal immigration. This is the first Administration
  to address this primary responsibility squarely. We are targeting most of our Federal
  dollars to those initiatives that address the root causes that lead to increased
  burdens on States.\n                The Federal Government provides States with
  billions of dollars to provide for health care, education, and other services and
  benefits for immigrants. This Administration is proposing increases for immigration
  and immigration-related spending of 25 percent in 1996 compared to 1993 levels.
  In addition, this Administration is the first to obtain funding from the Congress
  to reimburse States for a share of the costs of incarcerated illegal aliens.\n                This
  Administration will continue to work with States to obtain more Federal help for
  certain State costs and will oppose inappropriate cost-shifting to the States.\n
  \           \n            INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION\n                This Administration
  will continue to emphasize international cooperative efforts to address illegal
  immigration.\n                Pursuant to a Presidential Review Directive (PRD),
  the Department of State is now coordinating a study on United States policy toward
  international refugee and migration affairs. I hereby direct that, as part of that
  PRD process, this report to the National Security Council include the relationship
  of economic development and migration in the Western Hemisphere and, in particular,
  provide recommendations for further foreign economic policy measures to address
  causes of illegal immigration.\n                The Department of State shall coordinate
  an interagency effort to consider expanded arrangements with foreign governments
  for return of criminal and deportable aliens.\n                The Department of
  State also shall seek to negotiate readmission agreements for persons who could
  have sought asylum in the last country from which they arrived. Such agreements
  will take due regard of U.S. obligations under the Protocol Relating to the Status
  of Refugees.\n                The Department of State further shall implement cooperative
  efforts with other nations receiving smuggled aliens or those used as transhipment
  points by smugglers. In particular, we will look to countries in our hemisphere
  to join us by denying their territory as bases for smuggling operations.\n                The
  Department of State shall initiate negotiations with foreign countries to secure
  authority for the United States Coast Guard to board source country vessels suspected
  of transporting smuggled aliens.\n                This directive shall be published
  in the Federal Register.\n                \n                    William J. Clinton.\n

  vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America,
  the Attorney General and the Secretary of State are hereby ordered to exercise their
  authority, including that under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101–1557),
  as follows:Section 1. The Attorney General is directed to take any steps necessary
  to defer until January 1, 1994, the enforced departure of all nationals of the People’s
  Republic of China (PRC) and their dependents who were in the United States on or
  after June 5, 1989, up to and including the date of this order (hereinafter “such
  PRC nationals”).Sec. 2. The Secretary of State and the Attorney General are directed
  to take all steps necessary with respect to such PRC nationals (a) to waive through
  January 1, 1994, the requirement of a valid passport and (b) to process and provide
  necessary documents, both within the United States and at U.S. consulates overseas,
  to facilitate travel across the borders of other nations and reentry into the United
  States in the same status such PRC nationals had upon departure.Sec. 3. The Secretary
  of State and the Attorney General are directed to provide the following protections:(a)
  irrevocable waiver of the 2-year home country residence requirement that may be
  exercised until January 1, 1994, for such PRC nationals;(b) maintenance of lawful
  status for purposes of adjustment of status or change of nonimmigrant status for
  such PRC nationals who were in lawful status at any time on or after June 5, 1989,

  PRC nationals through January 1, 1994; and(d) notice of expiration of nonimmigrant
  status (if applicable) rather than the institution of deportation proceedings, and
  explanation of options available for such PRC nationals eligible for deferral of
  enforced departure whose nonimmigrant status has expired.Sec. 4. The Secretary of
  State and the Attorney General are directed to provide for enhanced consideration
  under the immigration laws for individuals from any country who express a fear of
  persecution upon return to their country related to that country’s policy of forced
  abortion or coerced sterilization, as implemented by the Attorney General’s regulation
  effective January 29, 1990.Sec. 5. The Attorney General is directed to ensure that
  the Immigration and Naturalization Service finalizes and makes public its position
  on the issue of training for individuals in F–1 visa status and on the issue of
  reinstatement into lawful nonimmigrant status of such PRC nationals who have withdrawn
  their applications for asylum.Sec. 6. The Departments of Justice and State are directed
  to consider other steps to assist such PRC nationals in their efforts to utilize
  the protections that I have extended pursuant to this order.Sec. 7. This order shall
  be effective immediately.Memorandum of President of the United States, Feb. 7, 1995,
  60 F.R. 7885, provided:Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesIt
  is a fundamental right and duty for a nation to protect the integrity of its borders
  and its laws. This Administration shall stand firm against illegal immigration and
  the continued abuse of our immigration laws. By closing the back door to illegal
  immigration, we will continue to open the front door to legal immigrants.My Administration
  has moved swiftly to reverse the course of a decade of failed immigration policies.
  Our initiatives have included increasing overall Border personnel by over 50 percent
  since 1993. We also are strengthening worksite enforcement and work authorization
  verification to deter employment of illegal aliens. Asylum rules have been reformed
  to end abuse by those falsely claiming asylum, while offering protection to those
  in genuine fear of persecution. We are cracking down on smugglers of illegal aliens
  and reforming criminal alien deportation for quicker removal. And we are the first
  Administration to obtain funding to reimburse States for a share of the costs of
  incarcerating criminal illegal aliens.While we already are doing more to stem the
  flow of illegal immigration than has any previous Administration, more remains to
  be done. In conjunction with the Administration’s unprecedented budget proposal
  to support immigration initiatives, this directive provides a blueprint of policies
  and priorities for this Administration’s continuing work to curtail illegal immigration.
  With its focus on strong border deterrence backed up by effective worksite enforcement,
  removal of criminal and other deportable aliens and assistance to states, this program
  protects the security of our borders, our jobs and our communities for all Americans—citizens
  and legal immigrants alike.A. I have directed the Attorney General to move expeditiously
  toward full implementation of our comprehensive border control strategy, including
  efforts at the southwest border. To support sustained long-term strengthening of
  our deterrence capacity, the Administration shall seek funding to add new Border
  Patrol agents to reach the goal of at least 7,000 agents protecting our borders
  by the year 2000.  To further this strategy, the Department of Justice shall implement
  the capacity to respond to emerging situations anywhere along our national borders
  to deter buildups of illegal border crossers, smuggling operations, or other developing
  problems.  Through the strategic use of sensors, night scopes, helicopters, light
  planes, all-terrain vehicles, fingerprinting and automated recordkeeping, we have
  freed many Border Patrol agents from long hours of bureaucratic tasks and increased
  the effectiveness of these highly-trained personnel. Because these tools are essential
  for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to do its job, I direct the
  Attorney General to accelerate to the greatest extent possible their utilization
  and enhancement to support implementation of our deterrence strategy.  The Department
  of Justice shall assess the effectiveness of efforts underway to deter repeat illegal
  crossers, such as fingerprinting and dedicating prosecution resources to enforce
  the new prosecution authority provided by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement
  Act of 1994 [Pub. L. 103–322, see Tables for classification].The Department of Justice
  shall determine whether accelerated expansion of these techniques to additional
  border sectors is warranted.B. This Administration has had success deterring large
  ship-based smuggling directly to United States shores. In response, smugglers are
  testing new routes and tactics. Our goal: similar success in choking off these attempts
  by adjusting our anti-smuggling initiatives to anticipate shifting smuggling patterns.To
  meet new and continuing challenges posed along transport routes and in foreign locations
  by smuggling organizations, we will augment diplomatic and enforcement resources
  at overseas locations to work with host governments, and increase related intelligence
  gathering efforts.The Departments of State and Justice, in cooperation with other
  relevant agencies, will report to the National Security Council within 30 days on
  the structure of interagency coordination to achieve these objectives.Congressional
  action will be important to provide U.S. law enforcement agencies with needed authority
  to deal with international smuggling operations. I will propose that the Congress
  pass legislation providing wiretap authority for investigation of alien smuggling
  cases and providing authorization to seize the assets of groups engaged in trafficking
  in human cargo.In addition, I will propose legislation to give the Attorney General
  authority to implement procedures for expedited exclusion to deal with large flows
  of undocumented migrants, smuggling operations, and other extraordinary migration
  situations.C. Nearly half of this country’s illegal immigrants come into the country
  legally and then stay after they are required by law to depart, often using fraudulent
  documentation. No Administration has ever made a serious effort to identify and
  deport these individuals. This Administration is committed to curtailing this form
  of illegal immigration.Therefore, relevant departments and agencies are directed
  to review their policies and practices to identify necessary reforms to curtail
  visa overstayers and to enhance investigations and prosecution of those who fraudulently
  produce or misuse passports, visas, and other travel related documents. Recommendations
  for administrative initiatives and legislative reform shall be presented to the
  White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration by June 30, 1995.Border deterrence
  cannot succeed if the lure of jobs in the United States remains. Therefore, a second
  major component of the Administration’s deterrence strategy is to toughen worksite
  enforcement and employer sanctions. Employers who hire illegal immigrants not only
  obtain unfair competitive advantage over law-abiding employers, their unlawful use
  of illegal immigrants suppresses wages and working conditions for our country’s
  legal workers. Our strategy, which targets enforcement efforts at employers and
  industries that historically have relied upon employment of illegal immigrants,
  will not only strengthen deterrence of illegal immigration, but better protect American
  workers and businesses that do not hire illegal immigrants.Central to this effort
  is an effective, nondiscriminatory means of verifying the employment authorization
  of all new employees. The Administration fully supports the recommendation of the
  Commission on Legal Immigration Reform to create pilot projects to test various
  techniques for improving workplace verification, including a computer database test
  to validate a new worker’s social security number for work authorization purposes.
  The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and Social Security Administration
  are directed to establish, implement, monitor, and review the pilots and provide
  me with an interim report on the progress of this program by March 1, 1996.In addition,
  the INS is directed to finalize the Administration’s reduction of the number of
  authorized documents to support work verification for noncitizens. Concurrently,
  the Administration will seek further reduction legislatively in the number of documents
  that are acceptable for proving identity and work authorization. The Administration
  will improve the security of existing documents to be used for work authorization
  and seek increased penalties for immigration fraud, including fraudulent production
  and use of documents.The Department of Labor shall intensify its investigations
  in industries with patterns of labor law violations that promote illegal immigration.I
  also direct the Department of Labor, INS, and other relevant Federal agencies to
  expand their collaboration in cracking down on those who subvert fair competition
  by hiring illegal aliens. This may include increased Federal authority to confiscate
  assets that are the fruits of that unfair competition.The White House Interagency
  Working Group on Immigration shall further examine the link between immigration
  and employment, including illegal immigration, and recommend to me other appropriate
  measures.The Administration’s deterrence strategy includes strengthening the country’s
  detention and deportation capability. No longer will criminals and other high risk
  deportable aliens be released back into communities because of a shortage of detention
  space and ineffective deportation procedures.A. The Department of Justice, in consultation
  with other relevant agencies, shall develop a streamlined, fair, and effective procedure
  to expedite removal of deportable aliens. As necessary, additional legislative authority
  will be sought in this area. In addition, the Department of Justice shall increase
  its capacity to staff deportation and exclusion hearings to support these objectives.B.
  To address the shortage of local detention space for illegal aliens, the Administration
  shall devise a National Detention, Transportation, and Removal Policy that will
  permit use of detention space across the United States and improve the ability to
  remove individuals with orders of deportation. The Department of Justice, in consultation
  with other agencies as appropriate and working under the auspices of the White House
  Interagency Working Group on Immigration, shall finalize this plan by April 30,
  1995.The Administration will seek support and funding from the Congress for this
  plan and for our efforts to double the removal of illegal aliens with final orders
  of deportation.C. The Institutional Hearing Program is successfully expediting deportation
  of incarcerated criminal aliens after they serve their sentences.To further expedite
  removal of criminal aliens from this country and reduce costs to Federal and State
  governments, the Department of Justice is directed to develop an expanded program
  of verification of the immigration status of criminal aliens within our country’s
  prisons. In developing this program, the viability of expanding the work of the
  Law Enforcement Support Center should be assessed and all necessary steps taken
  to increase coordination and cooperative efforts with State, and local law enforcement
  officers in identification of criminal aliens.Many of the Administration’s illegal
  immigration enforcement initiatives are mutually reinforcing. For example, strong
  interior enforcement supports border control. While there have been efforts over
  the years at piecemeal cooperation, this Administration will examine, develop, and
  test a more comprehensive coordinated package of deterrence strategies in selected
  metropolitan areas by multiple Federal, State, and local agencies.The White House
  Interagency Working Group on Immigration shall coordinate the development of this
  interagency and intergovernmental operation.The law denies most government benefits
  to illegal aliens. The government has a duty to assure that taxpayer-supported public
  assistance programs are not abused. As with work authorization, enforcement of eligibility
  requirements relies upon a credible system of verification. The INS, working with
  the White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration as appropriate, shall review
  means of improving the existing benefits verification program. In addition, we will
  seek new mechanisms—including increased penalties for false information used to
  qualify for benefits—to protect the integrity of public programs.Our efforts to
  combat illegal immigration must not violate the privacy and civil rights of legal
  immigrants and U.S. citizens. Therefore, I direct the Attorney General, the Secretary
  of Health and Human Services, the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
  and other relevant Administration officials to vigorously protect our citizens and
  legal immigrants from immigration-related instances of discrimination and harassment.
  All illegal immigration enforcement measures shall be taken with due regard for
  the basic human rights of individuals and in accordance with our obligations under
  applicable international agreements.States today face significant costs for services
  provided to illegal immigrants as a result of failed policies of the past. Deterring
  illegal immigration is the best long-term solution to protect States from growing
  costs for illegal immigration. This is the first Administration to address this
  primary responsibility squarely. We are targeting most of our Federal dollars to
  those initiatives that address the root causes that lead to increased burdens on
  States.The Federal Government provides States with billions of dollars to provide
  for health care, education, and other services and benefits for immigrants. This
  Administration is proposing increases for immigration and immigration-related spending
  of 25 percent in 1996 compared to 1993 levels. In addition, this Administration
  is the first to obtain funding from the Congress to reimburse States for a share
  of the costs of incarcerated illegal aliens.This Administration will continue to
  work with States to obtain more Federal help for certain State costs and will oppose
  inappropriate cost-shifting to the States.This Administration will continue to emphasize
  international cooperative efforts to address illegal immigration.Pursuant to a Presidential
  Review Directive (PRD), the Department of State is now coordinating a study on United
  States policy toward international refugee and migration affairs. I hereby direct
  that, as part of that PRD process, this report to the National Security Council
  include the relationship of economic development and migration in the Western Hemisphere
  and, in particular, provide recommendations for further foreign economic policy
  measures to address causes of illegal immigration.The Department of State shall
  coordinate an interagency effort to consider expanded arrangements with foreign
  governments for return of criminal and deportable aliens.The Department of State
  also shall seek to negotiate readmission agreements for persons who could have sought
  asylum in the last country from which they arrived. Such agreements will take due
  regard of U.S. obligations under the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.The
  Department of State further shall implement cooperative efforts with other nations
  receiving smuggled aliens or those used as transhipment points by smugglers. In
  particular, we will look to countries in our hemisphere to join us by denying their
  territory as bases for smuggling operations.The Department of State shall initiate
  negotiations with foreign countries to secure authority for the United States Coast
  Guard to board source country vessels suspected of transporting smuggled aliens.This
  directive shall be published in the Federal Register.Pub. L. 104–208, div. C, § 1(c),
