  Preface
- |2+

- "Charles Babbage's invention of the computer is \n"
- |
  something like the weather. Everyone working with computers
- |
  for the last two decades has been talking about it, but
- |
  nothing has been done. Every historical introduction to
- |
  a computer text contains a section on Babbage, often
- |
  extensive; but they are all based on the quite scanty
- |
  information about the Analytical Engine published during
- |
  the nineteenth century. The immense amount of manuscript
- |
  material concerning Babbage extant in England has remained
- |
  essentially untouched.
- |2+

- |
  The one hoped for exception was Maboth Moseley's
- |
  Irascible Genius (London, 1964). a full length biography
- |
  of Babbage. Moseley consulted the Babbage correspondence
- |
  at the British Museum and the unpublished biography of
- |
  Babbage written by his friend Harry Wilmot Buxton; yet
- |
  despite the fact that Moseley was the editor of a computer
- |
  journal, she did not examine Babbage's notebooks and
- |
  drawings, now in the Science Museum in South Kensington,
- |
  and her book contains virtually nothing of interest on the
- |
  Analytical Engine. On the whole, Irascible Genius is a
- |
  good deal less interesting than Babbage's own volume of
- |
  memoirs, Passages from the Life of a Philosopher (London,
- |
  1864), and it is no more balanced, and not very much
- |
  more accurate.
- |2+

- |
  Unfortunately, the publication of Buxton's biography
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  would not solve the problem, for it is basically an
- |
  unorganized collection of extensive extracts from some
- |
  of Babbage's books, papers, and letters; and while many
- |
  of these are quite interesting, they are badly in need of
- |
  more coherent treatment, and there are many gaps in their
- |
  coverage.
- |2+

- |
  Consequently, the student of Babbage's work must
- |
  return directly to the original sources. The manuscript
- |
  material is in three primary collections, on which this
- |
  study is based. Twenty volumes of Babbage's correspondence
- |
  are deposited in the British Museum; a similar quantity
- |
  of technical material is held by the Science Museum in
- |
  South Kensington; and the Museum of the History of Science
- |
  at Oxford University has Buxton's manuscript biography,
- |
  and, more important, the Babbage papers upon which it
- |
  was based.
- |2+

- "Although Babbage's life and accomplishments \n"
- |
  encompassed far more that was important than the invention
- |
  of his two calculating machines, the Difference and
- |
  Analytical Engines, it is on them that new research has
- |
  most been needed; consequently, the present study is
- |
  limited to material relevant to them. Babbage's early
- |
  mathematical work, his role in founding or reforming
- |
  several important scientific societies, and his many other
- |
  activities will scarcely be touched upon. But the first
- |
  chapter, by way of introduction, will provide a brief
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  sketch of Babbage's life, as it is the context into which
- |
  the calculating machines must be fitted. Likewise, this
- |
  study will not deal with the development of calculating
- |
  machines before or after Babbage. His work was completely
- |
  out of the mainstream of invention and construction which
- |
  led from the primitive desk calculators of the seventeenth
- |
  century to their widespread commercial success by the
- |
  beginning of the twentieth century, and later to what we
- |
  know as computers; Babbage was neither influenced by
- |
  what had gone before nor influential upon what followed
- |
  him.
- |2+

- |
  The invention, development, attempted construction,
- |
  and eventual abandonment of the first Difference Engine
- |
  will be considered in the second chapter. The third chapter
- |
  deals with the invention of the Analytical Engine and its
- |
  period of primary development, from 1834 to 1847. The
- |
  fourth chapter deals with three later concerns of Babbage:
- |
  a project to interest the government in what he called his
- |
  Difference Engine No. 2; support for the Scheutz Difference
- |
  Engine, a simplified version of his own earlier machine;
- |
  and his resumption of work on the Analytical Engine late
- |
  in life, with the intention of attempting its construction.
- |
  The final chapter will provide some observations on the
- |
  general character of Babbage's work on the Analytical
- |
  Engine.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  My own interest in Babbage was first aroused through
- |
  a research project on the history of calculating machines
- |
  and computers directed by Professor I.B. Cohen and Professor
- |
  Owen Gingerich on behalf of the International Business
- |
  Machines company for the purpose of developing an IBM
- |
  museum on computers and their history; this project still
- |
  continues. IBM has also provided generous financial and
- |
  logistical support for my own work. A trip to England to
- |
  study the manuscripts was supported by a grant from the
- |
  National Science Foundation. Assistance and access to
- "the sources has been provided by the staffs of the \n"
- |
  Manuscripts Division of the British Museum, the Museum of the
- |
  History of Science at Oxford University, and especially
- |
  the Science Museum in South Kensington, London, where Dr.
- |
  H.B. Calvert has long had a special interest in Babbage.
- |
  Professor Gingerich has read this thesis and made
- |
  valuable suggestions, as has Kenneth Manning.
- |2+

- |
  To all these and other individuals and institutions
- |
  who have helped me in ways large and small, I express
- |
  my gratitude.

  5  \n\n\n\n\nThe Little Engines that Could've:\nThe Calculating Machines of Charles

  of Science\nin partial fulfillment of the requirements\nfor the degree of\nDoctor
  of Philosophy\nin the subject of\nHistory of Science\n\nHarvard University\nCambridge,
  Massachusetts\n\nAugust, 1970\nCopyright reserved by the author.\n\n\n\nPreface\n\nCharles
  Babbage's invention of the computer is \nsomething like the weather. Everyone working
  with computers\nfor the last two decades has been talking about it, but\nnothing
  has been done. Every historical introduction to\na computer text contains a section
  on Babbage, often\nextensive; but they are all based on the quite scanty\ninformation
  about the Analytical Engine published during\nthe nineteenth century. The immense
  amount of manuscript\nmaterial concerning Babbage extant in England has remained\nessentially
  untouched.\n\nThe one hoped for exception was Maboth Moseley's\nIrascible Genius
  (London, 1964). a full length biography\nof Babbage. Moseley consulted the Babbage
  correspondence\nat the British Museum and the unpublished biography of\nBabbage
  written by his friend Harry Wilmot Buxton; yet\ndespite the fact that Moseley was
  the editor of a computer\njournal, she did not examine Babbage's notebooks and\ndrawings,
  now in the Science Museum in South Kensington,\nand her book contains virtually
  nothing of interest on the\nAnalytical Engine. On the whole, Irascible Genius is
  a\ngood deal less interesting than Babbage's own volume of\nmemoirs, Passages from
  the Life of a Philosopher (London,\n1864), and it is no more balanced, and not very
  much\nmore accurate.\n\nUnfortunately, the publication of Buxton's biography\n\n\n\nwould
  not solve the problem, for it is basically an\nunorganized collection of extensive
  extracts from some\nof Babbage's books, papers, and letters; and while many\nof
  these are quite interesting, they are badly in need of\nmore coherent treatment,
  and there are many gaps in their\ncoverage.\n\nConsequently, the student of Babbage's
  work must\nreturn directly to the original sources. The manuscript\nmaterial is
  in three primary collections, on which this\nstudy is based. Twenty volumes of Babbage's
  correspondence\nare deposited in the British Museum; a similar quantity\nof technical
  material is held by the Science Museum in\nSouth Kensington; and the Museum of the
  History of Science\nat Oxford University has Buxton's manuscript biography,\nand,
  more important, the Babbage papers upon which it\nwas based.\n\nAlthough Babbage's
  life and accomplishments \nencompassed far more that was important than the invention\nof
  his two calculating machines, the Difference and\nAnalytical Engines, it is on them
  that new research has\nmost been needed; consequently, the present study is\nlimited
  to material relevant to them. Babbage's early\nmathematical work, his role in founding
  or reforming\nseveral important scientific societies, and his many other\nactivities
  will scarcely be touched upon. But the first\nchapter, by way of introduction, will
  provide a brief\n\n\n\nsketch of Babbage's life, as it is the context into which\nthe
  calculating machines must be fitted. Likewise, this\nstudy will not deal with the
  development of calculating\nmachines before or after Babbage. His work was completely\nout
  of the mainstream of invention and construction which\nled from the primitive desk
  calculators of the seventeenth\ncentury to their widespread commercial success by
  the\nbeginning of the twentieth century, and later to what we\nknow as computers;
  Babbage was neither influenced by\nwhat had gone before nor influential upon what
  followed\nhim.\n\nThe invention, development, attempted construction,\nand eventual
  abandonment of the first Difference Engine\nwill be considered in the second chapter.
  The third chapter\ndeals with the invention of the Analytical Engine and its\nperiod
  of primary development, from 1834 to 1847. The\nfourth chapter deals with three
  later concerns of Babbage:\na project to interest the government in what he called
  his\nDifference Engine No. 2; support for the Scheutz Difference\nEngine, a simplified
  version of his own earlier machine;\nand his resumption of work on the Analytical
  Engine late\nin life, with the intention of attempting its construction.\nThe final
  chapter will provide some observations on the\ngeneral character of Babbage's work
  on the Analytical\nEngine.\n\n\n\nMy own interest in Babbage was first aroused through\na
  research project on the history of calculating machines\nand computers directed
  by Professor I.B. Cohen and Professor\nOwen Gingerich on behalf of the International
  Business\nMachines company for the purpose of developing an IBM\nmuseum on computers
  and their history; this project still\ncontinues. IBM has also provided generous
  financial and\nlogistical support for my own work. A trip to England to\nstudy the
  manuscripts was supported by a grant from the\nNational Science Foundation. Assistance
  and access to\nthe sources has been provided by the staffs of the \nManuscripts
  Division of the British Museum, the Museum of the\nHistory of Science at Oxford
  University, and especially\nthe Science Museum in South Kensington, London, where
  Dr.\nH.B. Calvert has long had a special interest in Babbage.\nProfessor Gingerich
  has read this thesis and made\nvaluable suggestions, as has Kenneth Manning.\n\nTo
  all these and other individuals and institutions\nwho have helped me in ways large
  and small, I express\nmy gratitude.\n\n\n\nNote on Sources and Quotations\n\nThe

  one hoped for exception was Maboth Moseley's\nIrascible Genius (London, 1964). a
  full length biography\nof Babbage. Moseley consulted the Babbage correspondence\nat
  the British Museum and the unpublished biography of\nBabbage written by his friend
  Harry Wilmot Buxton; yet\ndespite the fact that Moseley was the editor of a computer\njournal,
  she did not examine Babbage's notebooks and\ndrawings, now in the Science Museum
  in South Kensington,\nand her book contains virtually nothing of interest on the\nAnalytical
  Engine. On the whole, Irascible Genius is a\ngood deal less interesting than Babbage's
  own volume of\nmemoirs, Passages from the Life of a Philosopher (London,\n1864),
  and it is no more balanced, and not very much\nmore accurate.\n\nUnfortunately,
  the publication of Buxton's biography\n\n\n\nwould not solve the problem, for it
  is basically an\nunorganized collection of extensive extracts from some\nof Babbage's
  books, papers, and letters; and while many\nof these are quite interesting, they
  are badly in need of\nmore coherent treatment, and there are many gaps in their\ncoverage.\n\nConsequently,
  the student of Babbage's work must\nreturn directly to the original sources. The
  manuscript\nmaterial is in three primary collections, on which this\nstudy is based.
  Twenty volumes of Babbage's correspondence\nare deposited in the British Museum;
  a similar quantity\nof technical material is held by the Science Museum in\nSouth
  Kensington; and the Museum of the History of Science\nat Oxford University has Buxton's
  manuscript biography,\nand, more important, the Babbage papers upon which it\nwas
  based.\n\nAlthough Babbage's life and accomplishments \nencompassed far more that
  was important than the invention\nof his two calculating machines, the Difference
  and\nAnalytical Engines, it is on them that new research has\nmost been needed;
  consequently, the present study is\nlimited to material relevant to them. Babbage's
  early\nmathematical work, his role in founding or reforming\nseveral important scientific
  societies, and his many other\nactivities will scarcely be touched upon. But the
  first\nchapter, by way of introduction, will provide a brief\n\n\n\nsketch of Babbage's
  life, as it is the context into which\nthe calculating machines must be fitted.
  Likewise, this\nstudy will not deal with the development of calculating\nmachines
  before or after Babbage. His work was completely\nout of the mainstream of invention
  and construction which\nled from the primitive desk calculators of the seventeenth\ncentury
  to their widespread commercial success by the\nbeginning of the twentieth century,
  and later to what we\nknow as computers; Babbage was neither influenced by\nwhat
  had gone before nor influential upon what followed\nhim.\n\nThe invention, development,
  attempted construction,\nand eventual abandonment of the first Difference Engine\nwill
  be considered in the second chapter. The third chapter\ndeals with the invention
  of the Analytical Engine and its\nperiod of primary development, from 1834 to 1847.
  The\nfourth chapter deals with three later concerns of Babbage:\na project to interest
  the government in what he called his\nDifference Engine No. 2; support for the Scheutz
  Difference\nEngine, a simplified version of his own earlier machine;\nand his resumption
  of work on the Analytical Engine late\nin life, with the intention of attempting
  its construction.\nThe final chapter will provide some observations on the\ngeneral
  character of Babbage's work on the Analytical\nEngine.\n\n\n\nMy own interest in
  Babbage was first aroused through\na research project on the history of calculating
  machines\nand computers directed by Professor I.B. Cohen and Professor\nOwen Gingerich
  on behalf of the International Business\nMachines company for the purpose of developing
  an IBM\nmuseum on computers and their history; this project still\ncontinues. IBM
  has also provided generous financial and\nlogistical support for my own work. A
  trip to England to\nstudy the manuscripts was supported by a grant from the\nNational
  Science Foundation. Assistance and access to\nthe sources has been provided by the
  staffs of the \nManuscripts Division of the British Museum, the Museum of the\nHistory
  of Science at Oxford University, and especially\nthe Science Museum in South Kensington,
  London, where Dr.\nH.B. Calvert has long had a special interest in Babbage.\nProfessor
  Gingerich has read this thesis and made\nvaluable suggestions, as has Kenneth Manning.\n\nTo
  all these and other individuals and institutions\nwho have helped me in ways large
  and small, I express\nmy gratitude.\n\n\nThe following abbreviations are used in
  the notes for\nsources frequently cited. Further information will be\nfound in the
  Bibliography.\n\n\n\n\nMany of the quotations given in this thesis are from\nmanuscript
  sources, often from rough notes or drafts.\nFor the sake of increased intelligibility,
  punctuation has\nbeen altered to a certain extent (principally by the\naddition
  of commas), and spelling has been standardized;\n\n\n\ncapitalization and italics
  have not been altered.\nQuotations from published sources are of course left\nunchanged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvar
