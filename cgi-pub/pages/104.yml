- "       1. Introduction\r\n"
- "      Computation is now regarded as an equal and indispensable partner, along
  \r\n"
- "        with theory and experiment, in the advance of scientific knowledge and
  \r\n"
- "        engineering practice. Numerical simulation enables the study of complex
  \r\n"
- "        systems and natural phenomena that would be too expensive or dangerous,
  \r\n"
- "        or even impossible, to study by direct experimentation. The quest for \r\n"
- "        ever higher levels of detail and realism in such simulations requires \r\n"
- "        enormous computational capacity, and has provided the impetus for dramatic
  \r\n"
- "        breakthroughs in computer algorithms and architectures. Due to these advances,
  \r\n"
- "        computational scientists and engineers can now solve large-scale problems
  \r\n"
- "        that were once thought intractable. \r\n"
- "       Computational science and engineering (CSE) is a rapidly growing multidisciplinary
  \r\n"
- "        area with connections to the sciences, engineering, mathematics and computer
  \r\n"
- "        science. CSE focuses on the development of problem-solving methodologies
  \r\n"
- "        and robust tools for the solution of scientific and engineering problems.
  \r\n"
- "        We believe that CSE will play an important if not dominating role for \r\n"
- "        the future of the scientific discovery process and engineering design.
  \r\n"
- "      \r\n"
- "       It is natural that SIAM, as the society whose aim is to foster the computational
  \r\n"
- "        and applied mathematics which is at the core of CSE, should play a role
  \r\n"
- "        in the growth and development of this new discipline. The objectives of
  \r\n"
- "        this report are to attempt to define the core areas and scope of CSE, \r\n"
- "        to provide ideas, advice and information regarding curriculum and graduate
  \r\n"
- "        programs in CSE, and to give recommendations regarding the potential for
  \r\n"
- "        SIAM to contribute. \r\n"
- "      2. Definition of CSE\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "      2.1. What is it?\r\n"
- "      CSE is a broad multidisciplinary area that encompasses applications in \r\n"
- "        science/engineering, applied mathematics, numerical analysis, and computer
  \r\n"
- "        science. Computer models and computer simulations have become an important
  \r\n"
- "        part of the research repertoire, supplementing (and in some cases replacing)
  \r\n"
- "        experimentation. Going from application area to computational results \r\n"
- "        requires domain expertise, mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, \r\n"
- "        algorithm development, software implementation, program execution, analysis,
  \r\n"
- "        validation and visualization of results. CSE involves all of this. \r\n"
- "      \r\n"
- "       One point we would like to emphasize in this document is that CSE \r\n"
- "        is a legitimate and important academic enterprise, even if it has \r\n"
- "        yet to be formally recognized as such at some institutions. Although it
  \r\n"
- "        includes elements from computer science, applied mathematics, engineering
  \r\n"
- "        and science, CSE focuses on the integration of knowledge and methodologies
  \r\n"
- "        from all of these disciplines, and as such is a subject which is distinct
  \r\n"
- "        from any of them. \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "      2.2. What is it not?\r\n"
- "      CSE makes use of the techniques of applied mathematics and computer \r\n"
- "          science for the development of problem-solving methodologies and robust
  \r\n"
- "          tools which will be the building blocks for solutions to scientific \r\n"
- "          and engineering problems of ever-increasing complexity. It differs from
  \r\n"
- "          mathematics or computer science in that analysis and methodologies are
  \r\n"
- "          directed specifically at the solution of problem classes from science
  \r\n"
- "          and engineering, and will generally require a detailed knowledge or \r\n"
- "          substantial collaboration from those disciplines. The computing and \r\n"
- "          mathematical techniques used may be more domain specific, and the computer
  \r\n"
- "          science and mathematics skills needed will be broader.\r\n"
- "        It is more than a scientist or engineer using a canned code to generate
  \r\n"
- "          and visualize results (skipping all of the intermediate steps).\r\n"
- "      2.3. Research in CSE\r\n"
- "      Research in CSE involves the development of state of the art computer \r\n"
- "        science, mathematical and computational tools directed at the effective
  \r\n"
- "        solution of real-world problems from science and engineering. \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "      3. CSE as an Emerging Discipline\r\n"
- "      3.1. CSE in science and industry\r\n"
- "      Although some researchers have been doing what might now be called CSE \r\n"
- "        research for quite some time, for a number of reasons we appear to be \r\n"
- "        at a critical juncture in terms of the role being played by simulation
  \r\n"
- "        in science and industry. Historically, simulation has been used as a qualitative
  \r\n"
- "        guide for design and control, but has often not been expected to provide
  \r\n"
- "        accurate results for realistic physical systems. Increasingly, simulation
  \r\n"
- "        is being used in a more quantitative way, as an integral part of the manufacturing,
  \r\n"
- "        design and decision-making processes, and as a fundamental tool for scientific
  \r\n"
- "        research. Problems where CSE has played and is expected to continue to
  \r\n"
- "        play a pivotal role include: \r\n"
- "      Weather and climate prediction. Future energy and environmental strategies
  \r\n"
- "          will require unprecedented accuracy and resolution for understanding
  \r\n"
- "          how global changes are related to events on regional scales where the
  \r\n"
- "          impact on people and the environment is the greatest. Achieving such
  \r\n"
- "          accuracy means bringing the resolution used in weather forecasting to
  \r\n"
- "          the global predictions, which is not practical currently because of \r\n"
- "          the very large amounts of data storage and long computation times that
  \r\n"
- "          are required. A major advance in computing power will enable scientists
  \r\n"
- "          to incorporate knowledge about the interactions between the oceans, \r\n"
- "          the atmosphere and living ecosystems, such as swamps, forests, grasslands
  \r\n"
- "          and the tundra, into the models used to predict long-term change. Climate
  \r\n"
- "          modeling at the global, regional and local levels can reduce uncertainties
  \r\n"
- "          regarding long term climate change, provide input for the formulation

- "          accounts for 85% of the energy consumed annually in the U. S. and will
  \r\n"
- "          continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Achieving predictive simulation
  \r\n"
- "          of combustion processes will require terascale computing and an unprecedented
  \r\n"
- "          level of integration among disciplines including physics, chemistry,
  \r\n"
- "          engineering, mathematics and computer science. [8]\r\n"

- "          and nonnuclear test-based methods for stockpile stewardship. Rudimentary
  \r\n"
- "          versions of virtual testing and prototyping exist today. However, to
  \r\n"
- "          meet the needs of stockpile stewardship for the near future requires
  \r\n"
- "          high-performance computing far beyond our current level of performance.
  \r\n"
- "          [1] The ability to estimate and manage uncertainty in models and computations
  \r\n"
- "          is critical for this application, and increasingly important for many

- "          others.\r\n"
- "        Simulation, design and control of vehicles. It is now standard practice
  \r\n"

  \r\n"
- "          performance, but also for safety and ergonomics. Real-time simulation
  \r\n"
- "          with operator in the loop and/or hardware in the loop presents substantial

  \r\n"
- "          be 100% digitally designed, using 3D solid modeling. Throughout the \r\n"
- "          design process, the airplane was preassembled on the computer, eliminating
  \r\n"

- "      In addition to a background in mathematics and computer science, a CSE \r\n"
- "        graduate must have a thorough education in an application area (engineering
  \r\n"
- "        discipline or science). The CSE graduate's mathematical knowledge will
  \r\n"
- "        be sufficient to model technological and scientific problems. Knowledge
  \r\n"
- "        of computer science, and in particular numerical algorithms, software \r\n"
- "        design and visualization, enable the CSE graduate to make efficient use
  \r\n"
- "        of computers. A graduate knows how to find and exploit software (-packages)
  \r\n"
- "        for a certain task. A CSE student performs interdisciplinary work in mathematics,
  \r\n"
- "        computer science and an application area. A CSE graduate is trained to
  \r\n"
- "        communicate with and team with an engineer or physicist and/or a computer
  \r\n"
- "        scientist or mathematician to solve difficult practical problems. \r\n"

- "      We describe below the background that a well-prepared undergraduate will
  \r\n"
- "        have had before entering a CSE program. It is expected that many students
  \r\n"
- "        will be strong in several of the areas but may need to acquire expertise
  \r\n"
- "        in other areas during the initial stages of graduate study. \r\n"
- "      1. Mathematics and computer science \r\n"

- "        being taught in various engineering departments and mathematics. It may
  \r\n"

  \r\n"
- "        small institutions to start a CSE program. Perhaps even more importantly,
  \r\n"
- "        it gives the students a common educational foundation for the more advanced

  \r\n"
- "        Courses should include projects and presentations whenever possible. A

- "      4.3. Graduate Degree Programs and Models\r\n"
- "      There is a list of graduate degree programs \r\n"
- "        that are in place or in progress. \r\n"
- "       Two general models for the organization of CSE graduate degree programs
  \r\n"
- "        have emerged. In the first model, a graduate degree is awarded in the \r\n"
- "        new discipline of CSE. Often in this model the CSE program resides within
  \r\n"
- "        an existing department, usually mathematics or computer science. In the
  \r\n"
- "        second model, graduate degrees are awarded in the traditional disciplines
  \r\n"
- "        of mathematics, computer science, science and engineering, with an area
  \r\n"
- "        of specialization of CSE. The CSE programs residing in different departments
  \r\n"
- "        usually share a core curriculum and a basic set of standards for graduation
  \r\n"
- "        with the CSE specialization. Here we describe several existing programs
  \r\n"
- "      which illustrate the two models. \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "      4.3.1. MS/PhD in CSE\r\n"
- "      CSE at Stanford University. The Scientific Computing and Computational \r\n"
- "        Mathematics Program at Stanford University was established in 1987 and
  \r\n"
- "        is a graduate degree (M.S. and Ph.D.) awarding unit comprised of faculty
  \r\n"
- "        from a variety of departments, including Mathematics, Computer Science,
  \r\n"
- "        Operations Research, Statistics, Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering
  \r\n"
- "        and Electrical Engineering. It was established in recognition of the need
  \r\n"
- "        for graduate-level training at the intersection of the disciplines of \r\n"
- "        mathematics and computer science, which at the same time draws on applications
  \r\n"
- "        of fundamental scientific or technological importance. \r\n"
- "       The core courses, which all M.S. and Ph.D. students must complete, are \r\n"
- "        two year-long sequences, one in Numerical Analysis the other in Methods
  \r\n"
- "        of Mathematical Physics. In addition, both M.S. and Ph.D. student must
  \r\n"
- "        complete a year of courses in a focused application area, a year of courses
  \r\n"
- "        in Computer Science (Parallel Computing or Data Structures and Algorithms
  \r\n"
- "        are common choices) and further courses in Applied Mathematics and Numerical
  \r\n"
- "        Analysis. The choice outside the core sequences is very broad, allowing
  \r\n"
- "        the flexibility desirable in a Program of this scope, while the core sequences
  \r\n"
- "        ensure a sound intellectual basis for the Program and a commonality among
  \r\n"
- "        the students. \r\n"
- "       Ph.D. work falls into two broad categories: theoretical studies of computational
  \r\n"
- "        algorithms for the solution of problems in applied and computational mathematics,
  \r\n"
- "        and the development and application of novel software for the solution

- "        joint supervision of research also occurs and is encouraged. \r\n"
- "       Of the Ph.D. graduates of the Program a significant proportion (roughly
  \r\n"
- "        45%) have moved on to academic positions, typically in applied and computational

- "          \r\n"
- "        Each student is expected to demonstrate a graduate level proficiency \r\n"
- "          in three areas. Area A is Applicable Mathematics. This has traditionally
  \r\n"
- "          included functional analysis, partial differential equations, and mathematical
  \r\n"
- "          physics but could include mathematics or other areas of applicable mathematics.
  \r\n"
- "          Area B is Numerical Analysis in Scientific Computation, including a \r\n"
- "          significant block of course work in computer sciences, architecture,
  \r\n"
- "          parallel computing, etc. Area C is Mathematical Modeling and Applications.
  \r\n"
- "          This is an intellectually rich area in which course work may be selected

- "        some continue their studies at a university. Selections are done by the
  \r\n"
- "        colleges and universities themselves. \r\n"
- "       In Europe the selection of university students is often done at an earlier
  \r\n"
- "        stage. Though there are great differences in the evaluation process, in
  \r\n"
- "        principle schools of different intellectual level exist in parallel. To
  \r\n"

- "       As an example we consider Switzerland. Nine years of school are mandatory.
  \r\n"
- "        We distinguish three levels: \r\n"
- "       Level 1. Primary School: Nine school-years from age 7-16. Children \r\n"

- "        some other less intellectually challenging work. \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "       Level 2. Secondary School: The entrance exam takes place after \r\n"
- "        the first four or five years of primary school. The school also terminates
  \r\n"
- "        at the age of 16. Typically a graduate of secondary school will continue
  \r\n"
- "        with a 3-4 year apprenticeship and become a craftsman like a car mechanic,
  \r\n"
- "        an optician or a bookkeeper. \r\n"
- "       Level 3. Gymnasium: In secondary school (at the age of about \r\n"
- "        13) another exam can be taken to pass into the Gymnasium. This school \r\n"
- "        takes another six years and finishes with an exam, called Matura, \r\n"
- "        at the age of 19. Passing the Matura means being mature for an \r\n"

  \r\n"
- "        universities. When considering the creation of a new program, the model
  \r\n"

  \r\n"
- "        academic strengths and political considerations. There is much in common
  \r\n"
- "        in terms of basic academic content between the two models. \r\n"
- "       Comparing the two models directly is difficult. We offer a few observations.
  \r\n"
- "        The degree in CSE may allow a more focused and cohesive program, since
  \r\n"
- "        this program is often implemented within a single department such as mathematics
  \r\n"
- "        or computer science, or within a separate academic unit. On the other \r\n"
- "        hand it may be difficult to achieve depth within this type of program,
  \r\n"
- "        especially for the application areas, or to distinguish this program from
  \r\n"

- "\r\n"
- "       Since CSE is an emerging area, employment possibilities for students \r\n"

  \r\n"
- "        that the current climate is highly favorable toward interdisciplinary \r\n"
- "        work in science and engineering. One argument in favor of the degree in
  \r\n"
- "        traditional disciplines, with specialization in CSE, is that employers

- "Computation is now regarded as an equal and indispensable partner, along \r\n"
- "        with theory and experiment, in the advance of scientific knowledge and
  \r\n"
- "        engineering practice. Numerical simulation enables the study of complex
  \r\n"
- "        systems and natural phenomena that would be too expensive or dangerous,
  \r\n"
- "        or even impossible, to study by direct experimentation. The quest for \r\n"
- "        ever higher levels of detail and realism in such simulations requires \r\n"
- "        enormous computational capacity, and has provided the impetus for dramatic
  \r\n"
- "        breakthroughs in computer algorithms and architectures. Due to these advances,
  \r\n"
- "        computational scientists and engineers can now solve large-scale problems
  \r\n"
- "        that were once thought intractable.  Computational science and engineering
  (CSE) is a rapidly growing multidisciplinary \r\n"
- "        area with connections to the sciences, engineering, mathematics and computer
  \r\n"
- "        science. CSE focuses on the development of problem-solving methodologies
  \r\n"
- "        and robust tools for the solution of scientific and engineering problems.
  \r\n"
- "        We believe that CSE will play an important if not dominating role for \r\n"
- "        the future of the scientific discovery process and engineering design.
  \r\n"
- "       It is natural that SIAM, as the society whose aim is to foster the computational
  \r\n"
- "        and applied mathematics which is at the core of CSE, should play a role
  \r\n"
- "        in the growth and development of this new discipline. The objectives of
  \r\n"
- "        this report are to attempt to define the core areas and scope of CSE, \r\n"
- "        to provide ideas, advice and information regarding curriculum and graduate
  \r\n"
- "        programs in CSE, and to give recommendations regarding the potential for
  \r\n"
- "        SIAM to contribute. CSE is a broad multidisciplinary area that encompasses
  applications in \r\n"
- "        science/engineering, applied mathematics, numerical analysis, and computer
  \r\n"
- "        science. Computer models and computer simulations have become an important
  \r\n"
- "        part of the research repertoire, supplementing (and in some cases replacing)
  \r\n"
- "        experimentation. Going from application area to computational results \r\n"
- "        requires domain expertise, mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, \r\n"
- "        algorithm development, software implementation, program execution, analysis,
  \r\n"
- "        validation and visualization of results. CSE involves all of this.  One
  point we would like to emphasize in this document is that CSE \r\n"
- "        is a legitimate and important academic enterprise, even if it has \r\n"
- "        yet to be formally recognized as such at some institutions. Although it
  \r\n"
- "        includes elements from computer science, applied mathematics, engineering
  \r\n"
- "        and science, CSE focuses on the integration of knowledge and methodologies
  \r\n"
- "        from all of these disciplines, and as such is a subject which is distinct
  \r\n"
- "        from any of them. Research in CSE involves the development of state of
  the art computer \r\n"
- "        science, mathematical and computational tools directed at the effective
  \r\n"
- "        solution of real-world problems from science and engineering. Although
  some researchers have been doing what might now be called CSE \r\n"
- "        research for quite some time, for a number of reasons we appear to be \r\n"
- "        at a critical juncture in terms of the role being played by simulation
  \r\n"
- "        in science and industry. Historically, simulation has been used as a qualitative
  \r\n"
- "        guide for design and control, but has often not been expected to provide
  \r\n"
- "        accurate results for realistic physical systems. Increasingly, simulation
  \r\n"
- "        is being used in a more quantitative way, as an integral part of the manufacturing,
  \r\n"
- "        design and decision-making processes, and as a fundamental tool for scientific
  \r\n"
- "        research. Problems where CSE has played and is expected to continue to
  \r\n"
- "        play a pivotal role include:  CSE tools are critical in the exploration
  of scientific areas such as \r\n"
- "        astrophysics, quantum mechanics, relativity, chemistry and molecular biology,
  \r\n"
- "        where experiments are difficult and expensive if not impossible [9], and
  \r\n"
- "        in analyzing the reams of experimental data and developing models in emerging
  \r\n"
- "        areas such as: Growth in the expectations for and applications of CSE methodology
  has \r\n"
- "        been fueled by rapid and sustained advances over the past twenty years
  \r\n"
- "        of computing power and algorithm speed and reliability (see diagram below),
  \r\n"
- "        and the emergence of software tools for the development and integration
  \r\n"
- "        of complex software systems and the visualization of results. In many \r\n"
- "        areas of science and engineering, the boundary has been crossed where \r\n"
- "        simulation, or simulation in combination with experiment is more effective
  \r\n"
- "        (in some combination of time/cost/accuracy) than experiment alone for \r\n"
- "        real needs. In addition to a background in mathematics and computer science,
  a CSE \r\n"
- "        graduate must have a thorough education in an application area (engineering
  \r\n"
- "        discipline or science). The CSE graduate's mathematical knowledge will
  \r\n"
- "        be sufficient to model technological and scientific problems. Knowledge
  \r\n"
- "        of computer science, and in particular numerical algorithms, software \r\n"
- "        design and visualization, enable the CSE graduate to make efficient use
  \r\n"
- "        of computers. A graduate knows how to find and exploit software (-packages)
  \r\n"
- "        for a certain task. A CSE student performs interdisciplinary work in mathematics,
  \r\n"
- "        computer science and an application area. A CSE graduate is trained to
  \r\n"
- "        communicate with and team with an engineer or physicist and/or a computer
  \r\n"
- "        scientist or mathematician to solve difficult practical problems. We describe
  below the background that a well-prepared undergraduate will \r\n"
- "        have had before entering a CSE program. It is expected that many students
  \r\n"
- "        will be strong in several of the areas but may need to acquire expertise
  \r\n"
- "        in other areas during the initial stages of graduate study. 1. Mathematics
  and computer science 2. Application area: basic knowledge in an application area
  such as 1. Mathematics and computer science  We note that in many institutions there
  is much redundancy and overlap \r\n"
- "        between courses for example in numerical analysis or applied mathematics
  \r\n"
- "        being taught in various engineering departments and mathematics. It may
  \r\n"
- "        be advantageous to have a single core track, perhaps adding special sections
  \r\n"
- "        for discipline-specific material if that is deemed to be necessary. This
  \r\n"
- "        has the obvious advantage of cost-effectiveness, enabling even relatively
  \r\n"
- "        small institutions to start a CSE program. Perhaps even more importantly,
  \r\n"
- "        it gives the students a common educational foundation for the more advanced
  \r\n"
- "        courses, and exposes them to other students and faculty with a wide variety
  \r\n"
- "        of interests in computer science, mathematics, science and engineering.
  \r\n"
- "      2. Application areas. It is absolutely essential that interdisciplinary \r\n"
- "        collaboration be an integral part of the curriculum and the thesis research.
  \r\n"
- "        Courses should include projects and presentations whenever possible. A
  \r\n"
- "        CSE graduate should have working knowledge in an application area like
  \r\n"
- "       Interdisciplinary collaboration can be accomplished via participation \r\n"
- "        in a multidisciplinary research team and/or internship at a National Laboratory
  \r\n"
- "        or in industry. There is a list of graduate degree programs \r\n"
- "        that are in place or in progress.  Two general models for the organization
  of CSE graduate degree programs \r\n"
- "        have emerged. In the first model, a graduate degree is awarded in the \r\n"
- "        new discipline of CSE. Often in this model the CSE program resides within
  \r\n"
- "        an existing department, usually mathematics or computer science. In the
  \r\n"
- "        second model, graduate degrees are awarded in the traditional disciplines
  \r\n"
- "        of mathematics, computer science, science and engineering, with an area
  \r\n"
- "        of specialization of CSE. The CSE programs residing in different departments
  \r\n"
- "        usually share a core curriculum and a basic set of standards for graduation
  \r\n"
- "        with the CSE specialization. Here we describe several existing programs
  \r\n"
- "      which illustrate the two models. CSE at Stanford University. The Scientific
  Computing and Computational \r\n"
- "        Mathematics Program at Stanford University was established in 1987 and
  \r\n"
- "        is a graduate degree (M.S. and Ph.D.) awarding unit comprised of faculty
  \r\n"
- "        from a variety of departments, including Mathematics, Computer Science,
  \r\n"
- "        Operations Research, Statistics, Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering
  \r\n"
- "        and Electrical Engineering. It was established in recognition of the need
  \r\n"
- "        for graduate-level training at the intersection of the disciplines of \r\n"
- "        mathematics and computer science, which at the same time draws on applications
  \r\n"
- "        of fundamental scientific or technological importance.  The core courses,
  which all M.S. and Ph.D. students must complete, are \r\n"
- "        two year-long sequences, one in Numerical Analysis the other in Methods
  \r\n"
- "        of Mathematical Physics. In addition, both M.S. and Ph.D. student must
  \r\n"
- "        complete a year of courses in a focused application area, a year of courses
  \r\n"
- "        in Computer Science (Parallel Computing or Data Structures and Algorithms
  \r\n"
- "        are common choices) and further courses in Applied Mathematics and Numerical
  \r\n"
- "        Analysis. The choice outside the core sequences is very broad, allowing
  \r\n"
- "        the flexibility desirable in a Program of this scope, while the core sequences
  \r\n"
- "        ensure a sound intellectual basis for the Program and a commonality among
  \r\n"
- "        the students.  Ph.D. work falls into two broad categories: theoretical
  studies of computational \r\n"
- "        algorithms for the solution of problems in applied and computational mathematics,
  \r\n"
- "        and the development and application of novel software for the solution
  \r\n"
- "        of problems of scientific or engineering significance. Students in the
  \r\n"
- "        former category typically work with faculty from Computer Science, Mathematics,
  \r\n"
- "        Operational Rerearch or Statistics while those in the second category \r\n"
- "        work with advisors rooted in specific application domains; occasional \r\n"
- "        joint supervision of research also occurs and is encouraged.  Of the Ph.D.
  graduates of the Program a significant proportion (roughly \r\n"
- "        45%) have moved on to academic positions, typically in applied and computational
  \r\n"
- "        mathematics environments. The remainder are distributed throughout government
  \r\n"
- "        labs and industry.  CSE at University of Texas Austin. At the University
  of Texas \r\n"
- "        at Austin, CSE is known as CAM (Computational and Applied Mathematics)
  \r\n"
- "        but all six departments of the College of Engineering are strong contributors
  \r\n"
- "        to the program. There are a number of special features of the CAM program
  \r\n"
- "        at Texas that are noteworthy: CSE at University of Illinois. The purpose
  of the CSE Option at \r\n"
- "        the University of Illinois is to foster interdisciplinary, computationally
  \r\n"
- "        oriented research among all fields of science and engineering, and to \r\n"
- "        prepare students to work effectively in such an environment.  Students
  electing the CSE Option become proficient in computing technology, \r\n"
- "        including numerical computation and the practical use of advanced computer
  \r\n"
- "        architectures, as well as in one or more applied disciplines. Such proficiency
  \r\n"
- "        is gained, in part, through courses that are designed to reduce the usual
  \r\n"
- "        barriers to interdisciplinary work. Thesis research by CSE students is
  \r\n"
- "        expected to be computationally oriented and actively advised by faculty
  \r\n"
- "        members from multiple departments.  CSE is administered by a Steering Committee
  composed of one representative \r\n"
- "        from each participating department and chaired by the Director of CSE.
  \r\n"
- "        All faculty members affiliated with CSE have regular faculty appointments
  \r\n"
- "        in one of the participating departments. CSE is sponsored by the College
  \r\n"

  \r\n"
- "        Mathematics, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Nuclear Engineering,
  \r\n"
- "        Physics and Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.  CSE is a cooperative effort
  among the participating departments. Each \r\n"
- "        participating department has its own specific requirements for its CSE
  \r\n"
- "        option, but all are similar and share the common goals of the program.
  \r\n"
- "        Details are available by accessing the CSE \r\n"
- "        website. [3]  Upon satisfying the degree requirements of the student's
  graduate department \r\n"
- "        and the CSE requirements, the student is awarded a CSE Certificate signifying
  \r\n"
- "        successful completion of the CSE Option. Students must first be admitted
  \r\n"
- "        to one of the participating departments before enrolling in the CSE Option.
  \r\n"

  University \r\n"
- "        is an interdisciplinary graduate program that started in Fall 1995. It
  \r\n"
- "        offers specializations in Computational Science and Computational Engineering
  \r\n"
- "        in 17 departments across the schools of Purdue. Specializations are offered
  \r\n"
- "        at both M.S. and Ph.D levels.  The CSE Program at Purdue provides students
  with the opportunity to \r\n"
- "        study a specific science or engineering discipline along with computing
  \r\n"
- "        in a multidisciplinary environment. The aim of the program is not to produce
  \r\n"
- "        a student with parts of two degrees, but rather a student who has leaned
  \r\n"
- "        how to integrate computing with another scientific or engineering discipline
  \r\n"
- "        and is able to make original contributions in both disciplines. The expected
  \r\n"
- "        course load and examinations for students in this program are roughly \r\n"
- "        the same as for M.S. or Ph. D degrees in other disciplines at Purdue, \r\n"
- "        with approximately one third of the course load and examinations from \r\n"
- "        computing and two thirds in the student's home department. For students
  \r\n"
- "        whose home department is Computer Science or Computer Engineering, one
  \r\n"
- "        third of the course load will be from outside department application areas.
  \r\n"
- "       Specializations at the M.S. and Ph.D. level are offered by Agricultural

- "        because of the differences in structure of the educational systems, although
  \r\n"
- "        there is also much in common.  In Europe there are strong activities in
  CSE. For example, a curriculum \r\n"

  Resources\n\r\n      Graduate Education for Computational Science and Engineering\r\n\t\tSIAM
  Working Group on CSE Education\r\n       1. Introduction\r\n      Computation is
  now regarded as an equal and indispensable partner, along \r\n        with theory
  and experiment, in the advance of scientific knowledge and \r\n        engineering
  practice. Numerical simulation enables the study of complex \r\n        systems
  and natural phenomena that would be too expensive or dangerous, \r\n        or even
  impossible, to study by direct experimentation. The quest for \r\n        ever higher
  levels of detail and realism in such simulations requires \r\n        enormous computational
  capacity, and has provided the impetus for dramatic \r\n        breakthroughs in
  computer algorithms and architectures. Due to these advances, \r\n        computational
  scientists and engineers can now solve large-scale problems \r\n        that were
  once thought intractable. \r\n       Computational science and engineering (CSE)
  is a rapidly growing multidisciplinary \r\n        area with connections to the
  sciences, engineering, mathematics and computer \r\n        science. CSE focuses
  on the development of problem-solving methodologies \r\n        and robust tools
  for the solution of scientific and engineering problems. \r\n        We believe
  that CSE will play an important if not dominating role for \r\n        the future
  of the scientific discovery process and engineering design. \r\n      \r\n       It
  is natural that SIAM, as the society whose aim is to foster the computational \r\n
  \       and applied mathematics which is at the core of CSE, should play a role
  \r\n        in the growth and development of this new discipline. The objectives
  of \r\n        this report are to attempt to define the core areas and scope of
  CSE, \r\n        to provide ideas, advice and information regarding curriculum and
  graduate \r\n        programs in CSE, and to give recommendations regarding the
  potential for \r\n        SIAM to contribute. \r\n      2. Definition of CSE\r\n\r\n
  \     2.1. What is it?\r\n      CSE is a broad multidisciplinary area that encompasses
  applications in \r\n        science/engineering, applied mathematics, numerical
  analysis, and computer \r\n        science. Computer models and computer simulations
  have become an important \r\n        part of the research repertoire, supplementing
  (and in some cases replacing) \r\n        experimentation. Going from application
  area to computational results \r\n        requires domain expertise, mathematical
  modeling, numerical analysis, \r\n        algorithm development, software implementation,
  program execution, analysis, \r\n        validation and visualization of results.
  CSE involves all of this. \r\n      \r\n       One point we would like to emphasize
  in this document is that CSE \r\n        is a legitimate and important academic
  enterprise, even if it has \r\n        yet to be formally recognized as such at
  some institutions. Although it \r\n        includes elements from computer science,
  applied mathematics, engineering \r\n        and science, CSE focuses on the integration
  of knowledge and methodologies \r\n        from all of these disciplines, and as
  such is a subject which is distinct \r\n        from any of them. \r\n\r\n      2.2.
  What is it not?\r\n      CSE makes use of the techniques of applied mathematics
  and computer \r\n          science for the development of problem-solving methodologies
  and robust \r\n          tools which will be the building blocks for solutions to
  scientific \r\n          and engineering problems of ever-increasing complexity.
  It differs from \r\n          mathematics or computer science in that analysis and
  methodologies are \r\n          directed specifically at the solution of problem
  classes from science \r\n          and engineering, and will generally require a
  detailed knowledge or \r\n          substantial collaboration from those disciplines.
  The computing and \r\n          mathematical techniques used may be more domain
  specific, and the computer \r\n          science and mathematics skills needed will
  be broader.\r\n        It is more than a scientist or engineer using a canned code
  to generate \r\n          and visualize results (skipping all of the intermediate
  steps).\r\n      2.3. Research in CSE\r\n      Research in CSE involves the development
  of state of the art computer \r\n        science, mathematical and computational
  tools directed at the effective \r\n        solution of real-world problems from
  science and engineering. \r\n\r\n      3. CSE as an Emerging Discipline\r\n      3.1.
  CSE in science and industry\r\n      Although some researchers have been doing what
  might now be called CSE \r\n        research for quite some time, for a number of
  reasons we appear to be \r\n        at a critical juncture in terms of the role
  being played by simulation \r\n        in science and industry. Historically, simulation
  has been used as a qualitative \r\n        guide for design and control, but has
  often not been expected to provide \r\n        accurate results for realistic physical
  systems. Increasingly, simulation \r\n        is being used in a more quantitative
  way, as an integral part of the manufacturing, \r\n        design and decision-making
  processes, and as a fundamental tool for scientific \r\n        research. Problems
  where CSE has played and is expected to continue to \r\n        play a pivotal role
  include: \r\n      Weather and climate prediction. Future energy and environmental
  strategies \r\n          will require unprecedented accuracy and resolution for
  understanding \r\n          how global changes are related to events on regional
  scales where the \r\n          impact on people and the environment is the greatest.
  Achieving such \r\n          accuracy means bringing the resolution used in weather
  forecasting to \r\n          the global predictions, which is not practical currently
  because of \r\n          the very large amounts of data storage and long computation
  times that \r\n          are required. A major advance in computing power will enable
  scientists \r\n          to incorporate knowledge about the interactions between
  the oceans, \r\n          the atmosphere and living ecosystems, such as swamps,
  forests, grasslands \r\n          and the tundra, into the models used to predict
  long-term change. Climate \r\n          modeling at the global, regional and local
  levels can reduce uncertainties \r\n          regarding long term climate change,
  provide input for the formulation \r\n          of energy and environmental policy,
  and abate the impact of violent \r\n          storms. [8]\r\n        Combustion.
  Accurate simulation of combustion systems offers the promise \r\n          of developing
  the understanding needed to improve efficiency and reduce \r\n          emissions
  as mandated by U. S. public policy. Combustion of fossil fuels \r\n          accounts
  for 85% of the energy consumed annually in the U. S. and will \r\n          continue
  to do so for the foreseeable future. Achieving predictive simulation \r\n          of
  combustion processes will require terascale computing and an unprecedented \r\n
  \         level of integration among disciplines including physics, chemistry, \r\n
  \         engineering, mathematics and computer science. [8]\r\n        Nuclear
  stockpile stewardship. While new weapon production has ceased, \r\n          the
  ability to design nuclear weapons, analyze their performance, predict \r\n          their
  safety and reliability, and certify their functionality as they \r\n          age
  is essential for conscientious management of the enduring U. S. \r\n          nuclear
  stockpile. Dramatic advances in computer technology have made \r\n          virtual
  testing and prototyping viable alternatives to traditional nuclear \r\n          and
  nonnuclear test-based methods for stockpile stewardship. Rudimentary \r\n          versions
  of virtual testing and prototyping exist today. However, to \r\n          meet the
  needs of stockpile stewardship for the near future requires \r\n          high-performance
  computing far beyond our current level of performance. \r\n          [1] The ability
  to estimate and manage uncertainty in models and computations \r\n          is critical
  for this application, and increasingly important for many \r\n          others.\r\n
  \       Simulation, design and control of vehicles. It is now standard practice
  \r\n          in the design of mechanical systems such as vehicles, machines or
  robots \r\n          to use computer simulation to observe the dynamic response
  of the system \r\n          being designed. Computer-aided design drastically reduces
  the need to \r\n          construct and test prototypes. Simulation is used not
  only to improve \r\n          performance, but also for safety and ergonomics. Real-time
  simulation \r\n          with operator in the loop and/or hardware in the loop presents
  substantial \r\n          challenges for algorithms and software. [13]\r\n        Aircraft
  design. Since the early days of computing, computational \r\n          simulation
  has been used in the performance analysis and design of aircraft \r\n          components,
  such as the analysis of lift and drag of airfoil designs. \r\n          As computations
  become more sophisticated and computers more powerful, \r\n          computational
  simulation is used as an essential tool in the complete \r\n          design process.
  For example, the Boeing 777 was the first jetliner to \r\n          be 100% digitally
  designed, using 3D solid modeling. Throughout the \r\n          design process,
  the airplane was preassembled on the computer, eliminating \r\n          the need
  for a costly full-scale mark-up. CSE will play an increasing \r\n          important
  role in the entire design and analysis process as capabilities \r\n          improve
  for such things as numerical modeling of combustion for engine \r\n          design.\r\n
  \       Electronic design automation. Electronic design automation and CSE \r\n
  \         have long had a symbiotic relationship. Modern electronic systems (most
  \r\n          notably the microprocessors that have enabled CSE to achieve its current
  \r\n          prominence) are extraordinarily complex. The development of such systems
  \r\n          is only possible with the aid of computational tools for simulation
  \r\n          and verification of the systems as part of the design process. Computation
  \r\n          plays an important role at all levels of electronic design, from simulating
  \r\n          the processes used to fabricate semiconductor devices, to simulating
  \r\n          and verifying the logic of a microprocessor system, to laying out
  the \r\n          floor plan of VLSI circuitry.\r\n       CSE tools are critical
  in the exploration of scientific areas such as \r\n        astrophysics, quantum
  mechanics, relativity, chemistry and molecular biology, \r\n        where experiments
  are difficult and expensive if not impossible [9], and \r\n        in analyzing
  the reams of experimental data and developing models in emerging \r\n        areas
  such as: \r\n      Biology. CSE technologies are rapidly becoming indispensable
  to the \r\n          biological and medical sciences. Simulation plays a major role
  in the \r\n          conceptual development of medical devices, both those used
  in diagnostic \r\n          procedures (electromagnetic, ultrasonic, etc.) and in
  design of artificial \r\n          organs (hearts, kidneys, etc.). Biomedical optics
  depend heavily on \r\n          computational modeling in uses in detection and
  treatment in oncology, \r\n          opthalmology, cardiology, and physiology. Computational
  modeling plays \r\n          a fundamental role in the emerging efforts to combine
  mathematics and \r\n          biology in the genomic sciences (genome sequencing,
  gene expression \r\n          profiling, genotyping, etc.). In this area one needs
  large scale simulations \r\n          with complex computational models to develop
  new theoretical/conceptual \r\n          models and understanding of molecular level
  interactions.\r\n        Chemistry. Computational chemistry (CC) is widely used
  in academic \r\n          and industrial research. Computed molecular structures,
  e.g., very often \r\n          are more reliable than experimentally determined
  ones. According to \r\n          \"Chemical & Engineering News,\" the newsletter
  of the American \r\n          Chemical Society, Computational Chemistry has developed
  from a \"nice \r\n          to have\"' to a \"must-have\"' tool [2]. The main incentive
  \r\n          of CC is the prediction of chemical phenomena based on models which
  \r\n          relate either to first principles theory (\"rigorous models\"), \r\n
  \         to statistical ensembles governed by the laws of classical physics or
  \r\n          thermodynamics, or simply to empirical knowledge. In real problem
  solving \r\n          situations, these models are often combined to form \"hybrid
  models\" \r\n          where only the critical part of the problem is treated at
  the rigorous \r\n          level of theory. Rigorous theory in the molecular context
  is synonymous \r\n          with quantum mechanics, i.e., solving the Schrödinger
  equation \r\n          for a molecular complex with or without the presence of external
  perturbation \r\n          (photons, electric fields, etc.). There are a number
  of methods available \r\n          which provide approximate solutions to the Schrödinger
  equation \r\n          (Hartree-Fock and Density Functional theory, e.g.). Simulation
  is used \r\n          to predict properties of large and complex entities such as
  a liquid, \r\n          the folding of a protein in solution, or the elasticity
  of a polymer. \r\n          Finally, empirical models most often try to establish
  correlations between \r\n          the structure of a molecule and its (pharmaceutical)
  activity. Simulations \r\n          and quantum chemical calculations, on the other
  hand, very often are \r\n          extremely compute-intensive due to the number
  of degrees of freedom \r\n          and the complexity of the terms to be evaluated.
  The high accuracy required \r\n          in these calculations sets restrictions
  with regard to the method used \r\n          to solve the partial differential equations
  (PDEs) involved. Further \r\n          information is available at the website for
  the International Union \r\n          of Pure and Applied Chemistry [7].\r\n        Materials.
  The challenge in materials research is to invent new materials \r\n          and
  to perfect existing ones by fabrication and processing so that they \r\n          have
  the desired performance and environmental response [8]. For example, \r\n          there
  are many new and important applications for thin films, including \r\n          silicon-based
  microelectronics, compound semiconductors, opto-electronics \r\n          devices,
  high-temperature superconductors and photovoltaic systems. \r\n          The growth
  of such thin films, which can be accomplished via processes \r\n          such as
  chemical vapor deposition (CVD), is sensitive to many factors \r\n          in the
  manufacturing process. Simulation is an essential tool for understanding \r\n          this
  process, and requires the development of mathematical models and \r\n          computational
  techniques. Process control, which is an order of magnitude \r\n          more computationally
  complex than simulation, is emerging as an essential \r\n          tool in fabrication
  [4]. Recently, large scale complex computational \r\n          modeling has been
  used to design high pressure, high throughput CVD \r\n          reactors to be used
  as enabling devices in the production of new and \r\n          exotic materials.\r\n
  \       Bioengineering. Historically, engineers have used chemistry, thermodynamics,
  \r\n          and transport to design chemical processes. Now these fundamental
  processes \r\n          are applied to the understanding of complex biological phenomena
  that \r\n          are governed by the same physical laws. Computer models are being
  used \r\n          to understand and to develop treatments for glaucoma, to understand
  \r\n          and to fabricate bioartificial materials for example bioartificial
  arteries, \r\n          and for studying the normal and pathologic response of soft
  hydrated \r\n          tissues in the human musculoskeletal system [11, 10].\r\n
  \     3.2. Enabling technologies for CSE\r\n      Growth in the expectations for
  and applications of CSE methodology has \r\n        been fueled by rapid and sustained
  advances over the past twenty years \r\n        of computing power and algorithm
  speed and reliability (see diagram below), \r\n        and the emergence of software
  tools for the development and integration \r\n        of complex software systems
  and the visualization of results. In many \r\n        areas of science and engineering,
  the boundary has been crossed where \r\n        simulation, or simulation in combination
  with experiment is more effective \r\n        (in some combination of time/cost/accuracy)
  than experiment alone for \r\n        real needs. \r\n      \r\n      4. CSE Graduate
  Education\r\n\r\n      4.1. Educational Objectives\r\n      In addition to a background
  in mathematics and computer science, a CSE \r\n        graduate must have a thorough
  education in an application area (engineering \r\n        discipline or science).
  The CSE graduate's mathematical knowledge will \r\n        be sufficient to model
  technological and scientific problems. Knowledge \r\n        of computer science,
  and in particular numerical algorithms, software \r\n        design and visualization,
  enable the CSE graduate to make efficient use \r\n        of computers. A graduate
  knows how to find and exploit software (-packages) \r\n        for a certain task.
  A CSE student performs interdisciplinary work in mathematics, \r\n        computer
  science and an application area. A CSE graduate is trained to \r\n        communicate
  with and team with an engineer or physicist and/or a computer \r\n        scientist
  or mathematician to solve difficult practical problems. \r\n      4.2. Curriculum\r\n
  \     4.2.1. Relevant background\r\n      We describe below the background that
  a well-prepared undergraduate will \r\n        have had before entering a CSE program.
  It is expected that many students \r\n        will be strong in several of the areas
  but may need to acquire expertise \r\n        in other areas during the initial
  stages of graduate study. \r\n      1. Mathematics and computer science \r\n\r\n
  \     Calculus\r\n        Basic applied math\r\n        Linear algebra\r\n        Real/complex
  analysis\r\n        Software design, programming, and testing\r\n        Data structures
  and algorithms\r\n        Numerical analysis\r\n      2. Application area: basic
  knowledge in an application area such as \r\n      Physics\r\n        Chemistry\r\n
  \       Computer science (for example, data mining)\r\n        Fluid dynamics\r\n
  \       Thermodynamics\r\n      4.2.2. Core areas for graduate curriculum\r\n      1.
  Mathematics and computer science \r\n      Numerical analysis (linear algebra and
  optimization, ordinary and \r\n          partial differential equations)\r\n        Applied
  mathematics (ordinary differential equations, dynamical systems, \r\n          partial
  differential equations, mathematical modeling) \r\n        Computing (languauges/operating
  systems/networking; parallel/distributed)\r\n        Data Analysis (visualization,
  statistical methods) \r\n       We note that in many institutions there is much
  redundancy and overlap \r\n        between courses for example in numerical analysis
  or applied mathematics \r\n        being taught in various engineering departments
  and mathematics. It may \r\n        be advantageous to have a single core track,
  perhaps adding special sections \r\n        for discipline-specific material if
  that is deemed to be necessary. This \r\n        has the obvious advantage of cost-effectiveness,
  enabling even relatively \r\n        small institutions to start a CSE program.
  Perhaps even more importantly, \r\n        it gives the students a common educational
  foundation for the more advanced \r\n        courses, and exposes them to other
  students and faculty with a wide variety \r\n        of interests in computer science,
  mathematics, science and engineering. \r\n      \r\n\r\n      2. Application areas.
  It is absolutely essential that interdisciplinary \r\n        collaboration be an
  integral part of the curriculum and the thesis research. \r\n        Courses should
  include projects and presentations whenever possible. A \r\n        CSE graduate
  should have working knowledge in an application area like \r\n      \r\n      Computational
  physics\r\n        Physics of the atmosphere / weather forecast\r\n        Astronomy\r\n
  \       Computational chemistry\r\n        Computational fluid dynamics\r\n        Control\r\n
  \       Structural dynamics\r\n        Bioengineering\r\n        Acoustics\r\n        Reactive
  flows\r\n        Electromagnetics\r\n        Quantum mechanics\r\n        Reservoir
  engineering\r\n        Molecular biology\r\n        Electronic design automation\r\n
  \       Circuit simulation\r\n        Semiconductor simulation\r\n       Interdisciplinary
  collaboration can be accomplished via participation \r\n        in a multidisciplinary
  research team and/or internship at a National Laboratory \r\n        or in industry.
  \r\n      4.3. Graduate Degree Programs and Models\r\n      There is a list of graduate
  degree programs \r\n        that are in place or in progress. \r\n       Two general
  models for the organization of CSE graduate degree programs \r\n        have emerged.
  In the first model, a graduate degree is awarded in the \r\n        new discipline
  of CSE. Often in this model the CSE program resides within \r\n        an existing
  department, usually mathematics or computer science. In the \r\n        second model,
  graduate degrees are awarded in the traditional disciplines \r\n        of mathematics,
  computer science, science and engineering, with an area \r\n        of specialization
  of CSE. The CSE programs residing in different departments \r\n        usually share
  a core curriculum and a basic set of standards for graduation \r\n        with the
  CSE specialization. Here we describe several existing programs \r\n      which illustrate
  the two models. \r\n\r\n      4.3.1. MS/PhD in CSE\r\n      CSE at Stanford University.
  The Scientific Computing and Computational \r\n        Mathematics Program at Stanford
  University was established in 1987 and \r\n        is a graduate degree (M.S. and
  Ph.D.) awarding unit comprised of faculty \r\n        from a variety of departments,
  including Mathematics, Computer Science, \r\n        Operations Research, Statistics,
  Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering \r\n        and Electrical Engineering.
  It was established in recognition of the need \r\n        for graduate-level training
  at the intersection of the disciplines of \r\n        mathematics and computer science,
  which at the same time draws on applications \r\n        of fundamental scientific
  or technological importance. \r\n       The core courses, which all M.S. and Ph.D.
  students must complete, are \r\n        two year-long sequences, one in Numerical
  Analysis the other in Methods \r\n        of Mathematical Physics. In addition,
  both M.S. and Ph.D. student must \r\n        complete a year of courses in a focused
  application area, a year of courses \r\n        in Computer Science (Parallel Computing
  or Data Structures and Algorithms \r\n        are common choices) and further courses
  in Applied Mathematics and Numerical \r\n        Analysis. The choice outside the
  core sequences is very broad, allowing \r\n        the flexibility desirable in
  a Program of this scope, while the core sequences \r\n        ensure a sound intellectual
  basis for the Program and a commonality among \r\n        the students. \r\n       Ph.D.
  work falls into two broad categories: theoretical studies of computational \r\n
  \       algorithms for the solution of problems in applied and computational mathematics,
  \r\n        and the development and application of novel software for the solution
  \r\n        of problems of scientific or engineering significance. Students in the
  \r\n        former category typically work with faculty from Computer Science, Mathematics,
  \r\n        Operational Rerearch or Statistics while those in the second category
  \r\n        work with advisors rooted in specific application domains; occasional
  \r\n        joint supervision of research also occurs and is encouraged. \r\n       Of
  the Ph.D. graduates of the Program a significant proportion (roughly \r\n        45%)
  have moved on to academic positions, typically in applied and computational \r\n
  \       mathematics environments. The remainder are distributed throughout government
  \r\n        labs and industry. \r\n\r\n       CSE at University of Texas Austin.
  At the University of Texas \r\n        at Austin, CSE is known as CAM (Computational
  and Applied Mathematics) \r\n        but all six departments of the College of Engineering
  are strong contributors \r\n        to the program. There are a number of special
  features of the CAM program \r\n        at Texas that are noteworthy: \r\n      CSE
  is an independent academic program leading to the Ph.D. in CAM, \r\n          which
  reports directly to the Graduate School. It has its own curriculum, \r\n          although
  at present all courses are jointly listed, with some offered \r\n          by participating
  departments, each with its own oversight committee \r\n          that is involved
  in management of the program and its graduate students. \r\n        Fourteen academic
  departments participate in the CAM program, including \r\n          Mathematics,
  Computer Sciences, Aerospace Engineering and Engineering \r\n          Mechanics,
  Chemical Engineering, Petroleum and Geophysical Engineering, \r\n          Electrical
  Engineering, and Physics. Each member of the CAM Graduate \r\n          Studies
  Committee is a faculty member from one of the participating \r\n          departments.
  \r\n        There is an organized research center associated with the program \r\n
  \         called TICAM---The Texas Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics.
  \r\n          The mission of TICAM is to develop, organize, and administer programs
  \r\n          in basic and applied research in areas of applied mathematics and
  computational \r\n          sciences that deal with mathematical modeling and computer
  simulation. \r\n          \r\n        Each student is expected to demonstrate a
  graduate level proficiency \r\n          in three areas. Area A is Applicable Mathematics.
  This has traditionally \r\n          included functional analysis, partial differential
  equations, and mathematical \r\n          physics but could include mathematics
  or other areas of applicable mathematics. \r\n          Area B is Numerical Analysis
  in Scientific Computation, including a \r\n          significant block of course
  work in computer sciences, architecture, \r\n          parallel computing, etc.
  Area C is Mathematical Modeling and Applications. \r\n          This is an intellectually
  rich area in which course work may be selected \r\n          from one or more participating
  departments. Typical Area C options are \r\n          acoustics, computational fluid
  mechanics, electromagnetics, quantum \r\n          mechanics, kinetic theory, solid
  mechanics, materials science, and, \r\n          most recently, computational finance).
  Students take written exams in \r\n          all of these areas except Area B where
  traditionally an oral exam is \r\n          given. Each student's dissertation is
  expected to reflect components \r\n          of all three areas. The Ph.D. Advisory
  Committees must have representatives \r\n          from all three areas, as does
  the Graduate Studies Committee that manages \r\n          the overall program.\r\n
  \       Faculty in the program hold tenure in one of the participating departments.
  \r\n          There is a written document, signed by the Deans of the Colleges of
  \r\n          the participating departments, that guarantees that all participants
  \r\n          in the program will be judged in matters of promotion, merit raises
  \r\n          and tenure on the basis of their contribution to the CAM program independently
  \r\n          of their contributions to their individual departments.\r\n      4.3.2.
  MS/PhD in traditional area, with specialization in CSE\r\n      CSE at University
  of Illinois. The purpose of the CSE Option at \r\n        the University of Illinois
  is to foster interdisciplinary, computationally \r\n        oriented research among
  all fields of science and engineering, and to \r\n        prepare students to work
  effectively in such an environment. \r\n       Students electing the CSE Option
  become proficient in computing technology, \r\n        including numerical computation
  and the practical use of advanced computer \r\n        architectures, as well as
  in one or more applied disciplines. Such proficiency \r\n        is gained, in part,
  through courses that are designed to reduce the usual \r\n        barriers to interdisciplinary
  work. Thesis research by CSE students is \r\n        expected to be computationally
  oriented and actively advised by faculty \r\n        members from multiple departments.
  \r\n\r\n       CSE is administered by a Steering Committee composed of one representative
  \r\n        from each participating department and chaired by the Director of CSE.
  \r\n        All faculty members affiliated with CSE have regular faculty appointments
  \r\n        in one of the participating departments. CSE is sponsored by the College
  \r\n        of Engineering, but it is not limited to academic departments within
  the \r\n        College. Departments involved include Aeronautical and Astronautical
  Engineering, \r\n        Atmospheric Sciences, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering,
  Computer \r\n        Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Materials Science
  and Engineering, \r\n        Mathematics, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering,
  Nuclear Engineering, \r\n        Physics and Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.
  \r\n       CSE is a cooperative effort among the participating departments. Each
  \r\n        participating department has its own specific requirements for its CSE
  \r\n        option, but all are similar and share the common goals of the program.
  \r\n        Details are available by accessing the CSE \r\n        website. [3]
  \r\n       Upon satisfying the degree requirements of the student's graduate department
  \r\n        and the CSE requirements, the student is awarded a CSE Certificate signifying
  \r\n        successful completion of the CSE Option. Students must first be admitted
  \r\n        to one of the participating departments before enrolling in the CSE
  Option. \r\n      \r\n       All CSE courses are cross-listed with several of the
  participating departments. \r\n        CSE instruction includes both core and advanced
  courses. A sampling of \r\n        CSE courses includes numerical methods, parallel
  programming, computer \r\n        architecture, combinatorial algorithms, data structures,
  software design, \r\n        computer methods in civil engineering, computational
  solid and fluid mechanics, \r\n        finite element analysis, computational aerodynamics,
  computer simulation \r\n        of materials, parallel numerical algorithms, scientific
  visualization \r\n        and grid generation. \r\n\r\n       CSE at Purdue University.
  The CSE Program at Purdue University \r\n        is an interdisciplinary graduate
  program that started in Fall 1995. It \r\n        offers specializations in Computational
  Science and Computational Engineering \r\n        in 17 departments across the schools
  of Purdue. Specializations are offered \r\n        at both M.S. and Ph.D levels.
  \r\n       The CSE Program at Purdue provides students with the opportunity to \r\n
  \       study a specific science or engineering discipline along with computing
  \r\n        in a multidisciplinary environment. The aim of the program is not to
  produce \r\n        a student with parts of two degrees, but rather a student who
  has leaned \r\n        how to integrate computing with another scientific or engineering
  discipline \r\n        and is able to make original contributions in both disciplines.
  The expected \r\n        course load and examinations for students in this program
  are roughly \r\n        the same as for M.S. or Ph. D degrees in other disciplines
  at Purdue, \r\n        with approximately one third of the course load and examinations
  from \r\n        computing and two thirds in the student's home department. For
  students \r\n        whose home department is Computer Science or Computer Engineering,
  one \r\n        third of the course load will be from outside department application
  areas. \r\n      \r\n       Specializations at the M.S. and Ph.D. level are offered
  by Agricultural \r\n        Economics, Agronomy, Biological Sciences, Chemistry,
  Computer Sciences, \r\n        Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Electrical Engineering,
  Food Science, \r\n        Industrial and Physical Pharmacy, Mathematics, Mechanical
  Engineering, \r\n        Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacology, Nuclear Engineering,
  Pharmacy Practice, \r\n        Physics, Psychological Sciences, and Statistics.
  Students must be admitted \r\n        both to one of these departments and to the
  CSE program. The degree is \r\n        awarded in the home department with the specialization
  Computational \r\n        Engineering or Computational Science indicated on the
  transcript. \r\n        The program is administered by the CSE Graduate Committee
  with representation \r\n        from participating departments. CSE requirements
  are tailored to the home \r\n        department's requirements. Students are expected
  to have a strong interest \r\n        in computation and its application to science
  and engineering. Their undergraduate \r\n        training is expected to have given
  them a strong foundation in several \r\n        areas of science, engineering and
  computing [12]. \r\n\r\n      4.3.3. CSE programs in Europe\r\n      We discuss
  CSE programs in Europe separately from those in North America \r\n        because
  of the differences in structure of the educational systems, although \r\n        there
  is also much in common. \r\n       In Europe there are strong activities in CSE.
  For example, a curriculum \r\n        was started in 1997, at the Royal Institute
  of Technology in Stockholm, \r\n        Sweden. Interdisciplinary application oriented
  and problem solving curricula \r\n        that take into account computer simulation
  have been introduced into the \r\n        U.S. in recent years under the label Computational
  Science and Engineering \r\n        (CSE). Related curricula called \"Industrial
  Mathematics\" or \"Technical \r\n        Mathematics\" have been introduced earlier
  at various places, e.g., in \r\n        Linz and in Kaiserslautern. \r\n       Diploma
  (M.S.) in CSE at ETH. At ETH Zurich, W. Gander (Computer \r\n        Science), M.
  Gutknecht and R. Jeltsch (Mathematics) took up the discussion \r\n        on CSE
  in 1995. They were supported by the Executive Board of the ETH \r\n        Zurich
  which nominated a committee with two more members, W. van Gunsteren \r\n        (Chemistry),
  and K. Nipp (Mathematics). In April 1996 this committee worked \r\n        out a
  curriculum relying on existing courses at ETH, a cost neutral approach \r\n        without
  a need for additional personnel. The concept for the curriculum \r\n        CSE
  was accepted by the Executive Board ETH in July 1997 and the program \r\n        began
  in October 1997. Instead of the usual 4.5 years (9 semesters) of \r\n        diploma
  studies at ETH, the CSE curriculum takes only 2.5 years and builds \r\n        upon
  knowledge acquired in the first two years of a classical discipline. \r\n        Candidates
  for the CSE curriculum must take two years of basic studies \r\n        in Mechanical
  or Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Chemistry, \r\n        Mathematics,
  and Physics at ETH, or elsewhere. Depending on their first \r\n        studies the
  students have to close the \"gaps\" between those first two \r\n        years of
  studies and the model undergraduate studies for the CSE curriculum. \r\n        CSE
  graduates are able to work on interdisciplinary problem solving in \r\n        an
  application area making use of knowledge in mathematics and computer \r\n        science.

  \r\n\r\n       International Master Program in Scientific Computing at the Department
  \r\n        of Numerical Analysis and Computing Science, Royal Institute of Technology
  \r\n        (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden. KTH, founded in 1827 and the largest of \r\n
  \       Sweden's six universities of technology, has extensive international cooperation
  \r\n        both in research and education. About 30% of the regular students spend
  \r\n        one year of their studies at some university abroad and the KTH Master
  \r\n        Programs were started to strengthen internationalization. The programs
  \r\n        are given in English with tuition free of charge. A limited number of
  \r\n        grants from the Swedish Institute is available to cover living expenses.
  \r\n      \r\n       The International Master Program in Scientific Computing, hosted
  by \r\n        the Department of Numerical Analysis and Computing Science, was initiated
  \r\n        in 1996. It is open for students from all over the world with a BSc/BEng
  \r\n        or equivalent with a very good background in mathematics and knowledge
  \r\n        in numerical methods. Applicants are also required to be experienced
  in \r\n        programming and to have good overview of at least one application
  area \r\n        relevant to scientific computing, such as fluid dynamics, solid
  mechanics, \r\n        or electromagnetics. The duration of the Program is one and
  a half years, \r\n        with one year of courses and projects and half a year
  of thesis work. \r\n        The first class was enrolled in 1997 with eight students.
  The program \r\n        now attracts more than 100 applications, and 20 students
  from more than \r\n        10 countries were accepted to enroll autumn 1999. \r\n
  \      In the first week at KTH, the last before the official term starts, \r\n
  \       the students are given an intensive course in the computer environment \r\n
  \       and MATLAB and C programming. After this immersion the term proper starts
  \r\n        with lectures, labs, and project work. The regular courses are: \r\n
  \     First semester \r\n\r\n      Mathematical models, analysis and simulation\r\n
  \       Applied numerical methods\r\n        Object oriented program construction
  for scientific computing\r\n        The finite element method\r\n        Applied
  nonlinear optimization\r\n      Second Semester\r\n      Numerical treatment of
  partial differential equations\r\n        Computational fluid dynamics\r\n        Computational
  physics\r\n        Computational chemistry\r\n        Advanced numerical analysis\r\n
  \       Scientific visualization\r\n        Algorithms for parallel computation\r\n
  \     Third semester \r\n      High performance computing\r\n       The thesis work
  is started at the end of the second semester and completed \r\n        during the
  third semester. Throughout the entire program there are projects \r\n        within
  the courses and projects running through several of the courses. \r\n      \r\n
  \      Requirements for Graduation: To obtain a Master Degree in Scientific \r\n
  \       Computing at KTH the students must pass written exams on the six compulsory
  \r\n        courses and at least three eligible courses. All labs and projects shall
  \r\n        be completed and the thesis shall be presented orally in a seminar and
  \r\n        as a written technical report. \r\n       More information about the
  program can be found on \r\n        the web page [5]. \r\n\r\n       Impact of educational
  structure for CSE education in Europe vs. North \r\n        America. In North America
  every child goes to high school and graduates \r\n        at the age of 18. After
  that most continue with a college education, and \r\n        some continue their
  studies at a university. Selections are done by the \r\n        colleges and universities
  themselves. \r\n       In Europe the selection of university students is often done
  at an earlier \r\n        stage. Though there are great differences in the evaluation
  process, in \r\n        principle schools of different intellectual level exist
  in parallel. To \r\n        enter a school of higher level, an entrance exam has
  to be passed. \r\n       As an example we consider Switzerland. Nine years of school
  are mandatory. \r\n        We distinguish three levels: \r\n       Level 1. Primary
  School: Nine school-years from age 7-16. Children \r\n        who remain in this
  school will typically become factory workers or do \r\n        some other less intellectually
  challenging work. \r\n\r\n       Level 2. Secondary School: The entrance exam takes
  place after \r\n        the first four or five years of primary school. The school
  also terminates \r\n        at the age of 16. Typically a graduate of secondary
  school will continue \r\n        with a 3-4 year apprenticeship and become a craftsman
  like a car mechanic, \r\n        an optician or a bookkeeper. \r\n       Level 3.
  Gymnasium: In secondary school (at the age of about \r\n        13) another exam
  can be taken to pass into the Gymnasium. This school \r\n        takes another six
  years and finishes with an exam, called Matura, \r\n        at the age of 19. Passing
  the Matura means being mature for an \r\n        university and every university
  in Switzerland will accept the person \r\n        as a student. \r\n       The Matura
  level differs from country to country in Europe. Only \r\n        about 18% of the
  children in Switzerland pass the Matura. The European \r\n        mean is about
  30% with exceptions like France with about 50% doing the \r\n        \"Baccalaureat.\"
  \r\n\r\n       ETH Zurich offers a Diploma after 4.5 years of studies. This title
  is \r\n        roughly equivalent to a M.S. degree in North America. \r\n       Persons
  who have completed secondary school and an apprenticeship have \r\n        the possibility
  to take an entrance exam to one of the \"Fachhochschulen\" \r\n        (\"Universities
  of Applied Sciences\"). These institutions may be best compared \r\n        with
  colleges and their diploma after three years of studies is generally \r\n        accepted
  to be equivalent to a North American B. S. degree. \r\n      4.3.4. Discussion:
  structure of CSE graduate programs\r\n       It is clear that two major models for
  structuring graduate programs \r\n        in CSE have emerged, and that both have
  proven to be successful at various \r\n        universities. When considering the
  creation of a new program, the model \r\n        to be chosen and its chances for
  success will be highly dependent on local \r\n        academic strengths and political
  considerations. There is much in common \r\n        in terms of basic academic content
  between the two models. \r\n       Comparing the two models directly is difficult.
  We offer a few observations. \r\n        The degree in CSE may allow a more focused
  and cohesive program, since \r\n        this program is often implemented within
  a single department such as mathematics \r\n        or computer science, or within
  a separate academic unit. On the other \r\n        hand it may be difficult to achieve
  depth within this type of program, \r\n        especially for the application areas,
  or to distinguish this program from \r\n        applied mathematics. \r\n\r\n       Since
  CSE is an emerging area, employment possibilities for students \r\n        with
  the CSE degree are not well documented. There is a strong feeling \r\n        that
  the current climate is highly favorable toward interdisciplinary \r\n        work
  in science and engineering. One argument in favor of the degree in \r\n        traditional
  disciplines, with specialization in CSE, is that employers \r\n        and in particular
  universities and industry may be more open to this more \r\n        traditional
  degree structure. \r\n      5. Broadening the CSE Student Experience\r\n       It
  is absolutely essential that interdisciplinary collaboration \r\n        be an integral
  part of the curriculum and the thesis research. There are \r\n        a number of
  ways in which this can be achieved. \r\n      Courses should include multidisciplinary
  projects and presentations \r\n          whenever possible.\r\n        Participation
  in a multidisciplinary research team.\r\n        Internship at a National Laboratory
  or in industry.\r\n       The NSF National Partnership for Advanced Computational
  Infrastructure \r\n        (NPACIs) in the U.S. has programs in place to assist
  in CSE education. \r\n        Two excellent online news magazines provide up-to-date
  summaries of the \r\n        activities of the NPACIs: http://www.npaci.edu/npaci/online/
  \r\n        and the National Computational Science Alliance (NCSA) http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/.
  \r\n        The focused education programs are summarized through the cooperative
  \r\n        EOT-PACI (Education, Outreach and Training) Web Site for both PACIs
  http://www.eot.org/. \r\n        There are Research Experience for Undergraduates
  (REU) opportunities coordinated \r\n        through the EOT-PACI and details for
  applying are provided. \r\n      6. Role of SIAM\r\n       Recommendations regarding
  the potential role and contributions of SIAM \r\n        in CSE education and research
  include: \r\n\r\n       1. Define the core areas and scope of this field. \r\n        2.
  Outline ideas for curriculum. \r\n        3. Examine SIAM's existing journals and
  determine whether there is a place \r\n        for CSE research as we have defined
  it. \r\n        4. Hold conferences on CSE. \r\n        5. Establish a special interest
  group (SIAG) on CSE. \r\n        6. Create an electronic CSE Bulletin Board that
  would include the following: \r\n        discussion forum; pointers to graduate
  degree programs; infrastructure \r\n        for universities, government and industry
  to post internship opportunities \r\n        and for students to post resumes; infrastructure
  for universities, government \r\n        and industry to post job opportunities
  and for job seekers to post resumes \r\n        \r\n\r\n        7. Publish information
  of use for CSE education, for example articles \r\n        specifically oriented
  to teaching in CSE programs or courses. \r\n        8. Publish CSE textbooks. \r\n
  \       9. Publish CSE research books. \r\n      Acknowledgments\r\n      We would

  \              \r\n            \r\n      \r\n\r\n\nComputation is now regarded as
  an equal and indispensable partner, along \r\n        with theory and experiment,
  in the advance of scientific knowledge and \r\n        engineering practice. Numerical
  simulation enables the study of complex \r\n        systems and natural phenomena
  that would be too expensive or dangerous, \r\n        or even impossible, to study
  by direct experimentation. The quest for \r\n        ever higher levels of detail
  and realism in such simulations requires \r\n        enormous computational capacity,
  and has provided the impetus for dramatic \r\n        breakthroughs in computer
  algorithms and architectures. Due to these advances, \r\n        computational scientists
  and engineers can now solve large-scale problems \r\n        that were once thought
  intractable.  Computational science and engineering (CSE) is a rapidly growing multidisciplinary
  \r\n        area with connections to the sciences, engineering, mathematics and
  computer \r\n        science. CSE focuses on the development of problem-solving
  methodologies \r\n        and robust tools for the solution of scientific and engineering
  problems. \r\n        We believe that CSE will play an important if not dominating
  role for \r\n        the future of the scientific discovery process and engineering
  design. \r\n       It is natural that SIAM, as the society whose aim is to foster
  the computational \r\n        and applied mathematics which is at the core of CSE,
  should play a role \r\n        in the growth and development of this new discipline.
  The objectives of \r\n        this report are to attempt to define the core areas
  and scope of CSE, \r\n        to provide ideas, advice and information regarding
  curriculum and graduate \r\n        programs in CSE, and to give recommendations
  regarding the potential for \r\n        SIAM to contribute. CSE is a broad multidisciplinary
  area that encompasses applications in \r\n        science/engineering, applied mathematics,
  numerical analysis, and computer \r\n        science. Computer models and computer
  simulations have become an important \r\n        part of the research repertoire,
  supplementing (and in some cases replacing) \r\n        experimentation. Going from
  application area to computational results \r\n        requires domain expertise,
  mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, \r\n        algorithm development, software
  implementation, program execution, analysis, \r\n        validation and visualization
  of results. CSE involves all of this.  One point we would like to emphasize in this
  document is that CSE \r\n        is a legitimate and important academic enterprise,
  even if it has \r\n        yet to be formally recognized as such at some institutions.
  Although it \r\n        includes elements from computer science, applied mathematics,
  engineering \r\n        and science, CSE focuses on the integration of knowledge
  and methodologies \r\n        from all of these disciplines, and as such is a subject
  which is distinct \r\n        from any of them. Research in CSE involves the development
  of state of the art computer \r\n        science, mathematical and computational
  tools directed at the effective \r\n        solution of real-world problems from
  science and engineering. Although some researchers have been doing what might now
  be called CSE \r\n        research for quite some time, for a number of reasons
  we appear to be \r\n        at a critical juncture in terms of the role being played
  by simulation \r\n        in science and industry. Historically, simulation has
  been used as a qualitative \r\n        guide for design and control, but has often
  not been expected to provide \r\n        accurate results for realistic physical
  systems. Increasingly, simulation \r\n        is being used in a more quantitative
  way, as an integral part of the manufacturing, \r\n        design and decision-making
  processes, and as a fundamental tool for scientific \r\n        research. Problems
  where CSE has played and is expected to continue to \r\n        play a pivotal role
  include:  CSE tools are critical in the exploration of scientific areas such as
  \r\n        astrophysics, quantum mechanics, relativity, chemistry and molecular
  biology, \r\n        where experiments are difficult and expensive if not impossible
  [9], and \r\n        in analyzing the reams of experimental data and developing
  models in emerging \r\n        areas such as: Growth in the expectations for and
  applications of CSE methodology has \r\n        been fueled by rapid and sustained
  advances over the past twenty years \r\n        of computing power and algorithm
  speed and reliability (see diagram below), \r\n        and the emergence of software
  tools for the development and integration \r\n        of complex software systems
  and the visualization of results. In many \r\n        areas of science and engineering,
  the boundary has been crossed where \r\n        simulation, or simulation in combination
  with experiment is more effective \r\n        (in some combination of time/cost/accuracy)
  than experiment alone for \r\n        real needs. In addition to a background in
  mathematics and computer science, a CSE \r\n        graduate must have a thorough
  education in an application area (engineering \r\n        discipline or science).
  The CSE graduate's mathematical knowledge will \r\n        be sufficient to model
  technological and scientific problems. Knowledge \r\n        of computer science,
  and in particular numerical algorithms, software \r\n        design and visualization,
  enable the CSE graduate to make efficient use \r\n        of computers. A graduate
  knows how to find and exploit software (-packages) \r\n        for a certain task.
  A CSE student performs interdisciplinary work in mathematics, \r\n        computer
  science and an application area. A CSE graduate is trained to \r\n        communicate
  with and team with an engineer or physicist and/or a computer \r\n        scientist
  or mathematician to solve difficult practical problems. We describe below the background
  that a well-prepared undergraduate will \r\n        have had before entering a CSE
  program. It is expected that many students \r\n        will be strong in several
  of the areas but may need to acquire expertise \r\n        in other areas during
  the initial stages of graduate study. 1. Mathematics and computer science 2. Application
  area: basic knowledge in an application area such as 1. Mathematics and computer
  science  We note that in many institutions there is much redundancy and overlap
  \r\n        between courses for example in numerical analysis or applied mathematics
  \r\n        being taught in various engineering departments and mathematics. It
  may \r\n        be advantageous to have a single core track, perhaps adding special
  sections \r\n        for discipline-specific material if that is deemed to be necessary.
  This \r\n        has the obvious advantage of cost-effectiveness, enabling even
  relatively \r\n        small institutions to start a CSE program. Perhaps even more
  importantly, \r\n        it gives the students a common educational foundation for
  the more advanced \r\n        courses, and exposes them to other students and faculty
  with a wide variety \r\n        of interests in computer science, mathematics, science
  and engineering. \r\n      2. Application areas. It is absolutely essential that
  interdisciplinary \r\n        collaboration be an integral part of the curriculum
  and the thesis research. \r\n        Courses should include projects and presentations
  whenever possible. A \r\n        CSE graduate should have working knowledge in an
  application area like \r\n       Interdisciplinary collaboration can be accomplished
  via participation \r\n        in a multidisciplinary research team and/or internship
  at a National Laboratory \r\n        or in industry. There is a list of graduate
  degree programs \r\n        that are in place or in progress.  Two general models
  for the organization of CSE graduate degree programs \r\n        have emerged. In
  the first model, a graduate degree is awarded in the \r\n        new discipline
  of CSE. Often in this model the CSE program resides within \r\n        an existing
  department, usually mathematics or computer science. In the \r\n        second model,
  graduate degrees are awarded in the traditional disciplines \r\n        of mathematics,
  computer science, science and engineering, with an area \r\n        of specialization
  of CSE. The CSE programs residing in different departments \r\n        usually share
  a core curriculum and a basic set of standards for graduation \r\n        with the
  CSE specialization. Here we describe several existing programs \r\n      which illustrate
  the two models. CSE at Stanford University. The Scientific Computing and Computational
  \r\n        Mathematics Program at Stanford University was established in 1987 and
  \r\n        is a graduate degree (M.S. and Ph.D.) awarding unit comprised of faculty
  \r\n        from a variety of departments, including Mathematics, Computer Science,
  \r\n        Operations Research, Statistics, Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering
  \r\n        and Electrical Engineering. It was established in recognition of the
  need \r\n        for graduate-level training at the intersection of the disciplines
  of \r\n        mathematics and computer science, which at the same time draws on
  applications \r\n        of fundamental scientific or technological importance.
  \ The core courses, which all M.S. and Ph.D. students must complete, are \r\n        two
  year-long sequences, one in Numerical Analysis the other in Methods \r\n        of
  Mathematical Physics. In addition, both M.S. and Ph.D. student must \r\n        complete
  a year of courses in a focused application area, a year of courses \r\n        in
  Computer Science (Parallel Computing or Data Structures and Algorithms \r\n        are
  common choices) and further courses in Applied Mathematics and Numerical \r\n        Analysis.
  The choice outside the core sequences is very broad, allowing \r\n        the flexibility
  desirable in a Program of this scope, while the core sequences \r\n        ensure
  a sound intellectual basis for the Program and a commonality among \r\n        the
  students.  Ph.D. work falls into two broad categories: theoretical studies of computational
  \r\n        algorithms for the solution of problems in applied and computational
  mathematics, \r\n        and the development and application of novel software for
  the solution \r\n        of problems of scientific or engineering significance.
  Students in the \r\n        former category typically work with faculty from Computer
  Science, Mathematics, \r\n        Operational Rerearch or Statistics while those
  in the second category \r\n        work with advisors rooted in specific application
  domains; occasional \r\n        joint supervision of research also occurs and is
  encouraged.  Of the Ph.D. graduates of the Program a significant proportion (roughly
  \r\n        45%) have moved on to academic positions, typically in applied and computational
  \r\n        mathematics environments. The remainder are distributed throughout government
  \r\n        labs and industry.  CSE at University of Texas Austin. At the University
  of Texas \r\n        at Austin, CSE is known as CAM (Computational and Applied Mathematics)
  \r\n        but all six departments of the College of Engineering are strong contributors
  \r\n        to the program. There are a number of special features of the CAM program
  \r\n        at Texas that are noteworthy: CSE at University of Illinois. The purpose
  of the CSE Option at \r\n        the University of Illinois is to foster interdisciplinary,
  computationally \r\n        oriented research among all fields of science and engineering,
  and to \r\n        prepare students to work effectively in such an environment.
  \ Students electing the CSE Option become proficient in computing technology, \r\n
  \       including numerical computation and the practical use of advanced computer
  \r\n        architectures, as well as in one or more applied disciplines. Such proficiency
  \r\n        is gained, in part, through courses that are designed to reduce the
  usual \r\n        barriers to interdisciplinary work. Thesis research by CSE students
  is \r\n        expected to be computationally oriented and actively advised by faculty
  \r\n        members from multiple departments.  CSE is administered by a Steering
  Committee composed of one representative \r\n        from each participating department
  and chaired by the Director of CSE. \r\n        All faculty members affiliated with
  CSE have regular faculty appointments \r\n        in one of the participating departments.
  CSE is sponsored by the College \r\n        of Engineering, but it is not limited
  to academic departments within the \r\n        College. Departments involved include
  Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering, \r\n        Atmospheric Sciences, Chemical
  Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer \r\n        Science, Electrical and Computer
  Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, \r\n        Mathematics, Mechanical
  and Industrial Engineering, Nuclear Engineering, \r\n        Physics and Theoretical
  and Applied Mechanics.  CSE is a cooperative effort among the participating departments.
  Each \r\n        participating department has its own specific requirements for
  its CSE \r\n        option, but all are similar and share the common goals of the
  program. \r\n        Details are available by accessing the CSE \r\n        website.
  [3]  Upon satisfying the degree requirements of the student's graduate department
  \r\n        and the CSE requirements, the student is awarded a CSE Certificate signifying
  \r\n        successful completion of the CSE Option. Students must first be admitted
  \r\n        to one of the participating departments before enrolling in the CSE
  Option. \r\n       All CSE courses are cross-listed with several of the participating
  departments. \r\n        CSE instruction includes both core and advanced courses.
  A sampling of \r\n        CSE courses includes numerical methods, parallel programming,
  computer \r\n        architecture, combinatorial algorithms, data structures, software
  design, \r\n        computer methods in civil engineering, computational solid and
  fluid mechanics, \r\n        finite element analysis, computational aerodynamics,
  computer simulation \r\n        of materials, parallel numerical algorithms, scientific
  visualization \r\n        and grid generation.  CSE at Purdue University. The CSE
  Program at Purdue University \r\n        is an interdisciplinary graduate program
  that started in Fall 1995. It \r\n        offers specializations in Computational
  Science and Computational Engineering \r\n        in 17 departments across the schools
  of Purdue. Specializations are offered \r\n        at both M.S. and Ph.D levels.
  \ The CSE Program at Purdue provides students with the opportunity to \r\n        study
  a specific science or engineering discipline along with computing \r\n        in
  a multidisciplinary environment. The aim of the program is not to produce \r\n        a
  student with parts of two degrees, but rather a student who has leaned \r\n        how
  to integrate computing with another scientific or engineering discipline \r\n        and
  is able to make original contributions in both disciplines. The expected \r\n        course
  load and examinations for students in this program are roughly \r\n        the same
  as for M.S. or Ph. D degrees in other disciplines at Purdue, \r\n        with approximately
  one third of the course load and examinations from \r\n        computing and two
  thirds in the student's home department. For students \r\n        whose home department
  is Computer Science or Computer Engineering, one \r\n        third of the course
  load will be from outside department application areas. \r\n       Specializations
  at the M.S. and Ph.D. level are offered by Agricultural \r\n        Economics, Agronomy,
  Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Computer Sciences, \r\n        Earth and Atmospheric
  Sciences, Electrical Engineering, Food Science, \r\n        Industrial and Physical
  Pharmacy, Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, \r\n        Medicinal Chemistry and
  Pharmacology, Nuclear Engineering, Pharmacy Practice, \r\n        Physics, Psychological
  Sciences, and Statistics. Students must be admitted \r\n        both to one of these
  departments and to the CSE program. The degree is \r\n        awarded in the home
  department with the specialization Computational \r\n        Engineering or Computational
  Science indicated on the transcript. \r\n        The program is administered by
  the CSE Graduate Committee with representation \r\n        from participating departments.
  CSE requirements are tailored to the home \r\n        department's requirements.
  Students are expected to have a strong interest \r\n        in computation and its
  application to science and engineering. Their undergraduate \r\n        training
  is expected to have given them a strong foundation in several \r\n        areas
  of science, engineering and computing [12]. We discuss CSE programs in Europe separately
  from those in North America \r\n        because of the differences in structure
  of the educational systems, although \r\n        there is also much in common.  In
  Europe there are strong activities in CSE. For example, a curriculum \r\n        was
  started in 1997, at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, \r\n        Sweden.
  Interdisciplinary application oriented and problem solving curricula \r\n        that
  take into account computer simulation have been introduced into the \r\n        U.S.
  in recent years under the label Computational Science and Engineering \r\n        (CSE).
  Related curricula called \"Industrial Mathematics\" or \"Technical \r\n        Mathematics\"
  have been introduced earlier at various places, e.g., in \r\n        Linz and in
  Kaiserslautern.  Diploma (M.S.) in CSE at ETH. At ETH Zurich, W. Gander (Computer
  \r\n        Science), M. Gutknecht and R. Jeltsch (Mathematics) took up the discussion
  \r\n        on CSE in 1995. They were supported by the Executive Board of the ETH
  \r\n        Zurich which nominated a committee with two more members, W. van Gunsteren
  \r\n        (Chemistry), and K. Nipp (Mathematics). In April 1996 this committee
  worked \r\n        out a curriculum relying on existing courses at ETH, a cost neutral
  approach \r\n        without a need for additional personnel. The concept for the
  curriculum \r\n        CSE was accepted by the Executive Board ETH in July 1997
  and the program \r\n        began in October 1997. Instead of the usual 4.5 years
  (9 semesters) of \r\n        diploma studies at ETH, the CSE curriculum takes only
  2.5 years and builds \r\n        upon knowledge acquired in the first two years
  of a classical discipline. \r\n        Candidates for the CSE curriculum must take
  two years of basic studies \r\n        in Mechanical or Electrical Engineering,
  Computer Science, Chemistry, \r\n        Mathematics, and Physics at ETH, or elsewhere.
  Depending on their first \r\n        studies the students have to close the \"gaps\"
  between those first two \r\n        years of studies and the model undergraduate
  studies for the CSE curriculum. \r\n        CSE graduates are able to work on interdisciplinary
  problem solving in \r\n        an application area making use of knowledge in mathematics
  and computer \r\n        science. Outline of the Curriculum Hours of Work Per SemesterShort

  chosen. The core courses are: theory and numerical techniques of differential \r\n
  \       equations, optimization, parallel computing, computational quantum mechanics,
  \r\n        computational statistical mechanics, software engineering, and visualization/graphics.
  \r\n        The specialization fields are: physics of the atmosphere, computational
  \r\n        chemistry, computational fluid dynamics, control theory, robotics and
  \r\n        computational physics.  Further information is available at the ETH

  at the Department \r\n        of Numerical Analysis and Computing Science, Royal
  Institute of Technology \r\n        (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden. KTH, founded in 1827
  and the largest of \r\n        Sweden's six universities of technology, has extensive
  international cooperation \r\n        both in research and education. About 30%
  of the regular students spend \r\n        one year of their studies at some university
  abroad and the KTH Master \r\n        Programs were started to strengthen internationalization.
  The programs \r\n        are given in English with tuition free of charge. A limited
  number of \r\n        grants from the Swedish Institute is available to cover living
  expenses. \r\n       The International Master Program in Scientific Computing, hosted
  by \r\n        the Department of Numerical Analysis and Computing Science, was initiated
  \r\n        in 1996. It is open for students from all over the world with a BSc/BEng
  \r\n        or equivalent with a very good background in mathematics and knowledge
  \r\n        in numerical methods. Applicants are also required to be experienced
  in \r\n        programming and to have good overview of at least one application
  area \r\n        relevant to scientific computing, such as fluid dynamics, solid
  mechanics, \r\n        or electromagnetics. The duration of the Program is one and
  a half years, \r\n        with one year of courses and projects and half a year
  of thesis work. \r\n        The first class was enrolled in 1997 with eight students.
  The program \r\n        now attracts more than 100 applications, and 20 students
  from more than \r\n        10 countries were accepted to enroll autumn 1999.  In
  the first week at KTH, the last before the official term starts, \r\n        the
  students are given an intensive course in the computer environment \r\n        and
  MATLAB and C programming. After this immersion the term proper starts \r\n        with
  lectures, labs, and project work. The regular courses are: First semester Second
  SemesterThird semester  The thesis work is started at the end of the second semester
  and completed \r\n        during the third semester. Throughout the entire program
  there are projects \r\n        within the courses and projects running through several
  of the courses. \r\n       Requirements for Graduation: To obtain a Master Degree
  in Scientific \r\n        Computing at KTH the students must pass written exams
  on the six compulsory \r\n        courses and at least three eligible courses. All
  labs and projects shall \r\n        be completed and the thesis shall be presented
  orally in a seminar and \r\n        as a written technical report.  More information
  about the program can be found on \r\n        the web page [5].  Impact of educational
  structure for CSE education in Europe vs. North \r\n        America. In North America
  every child goes to high school and graduates \r\n        at the age of 18. After
  that most continue with a college education, and \r\n        some continue their
  studies at a university. Selections are done by the \r\n        colleges and universities
  themselves.  In Europe the selection of university students is often done at an
  earlier \r\n        stage. Though there are great differences in the evaluation
  process, in \r\n        principle schools of different intellectual level exist
  in parallel. To \r\n        enter a school of higher level, an entrance exam has
  to be passed.  As an example we consider Switzerland. Nine years of school are mandatory.
  \r\n        We distinguish three levels:  The Matura level differs from country
  to country in Europe. Only \r\n        about 18% of the children in Switzerland
  pass the Matura. The European \r\n        mean is about 30% with exceptions like
  France with about 50% doing the \r\n        \"Baccalaureat.\"  ETH Zurich offers
  a Diploma after 4.5 years of studies. This title is \r\n        roughly equivalent
  to a M.S. degree in North America.  Persons who have completed secondary school
  and an apprenticeship have \r\n        the possibility to take an entrance exam
  to one of the \"Fachhochschulen\" \r\n        (\"Universities of Applied Sciences\").
  These institutions may be best compared \r\n        with colleges and their diploma
  after three years of studies is generally \r\n        accepted to be equivalent
  to a North American B. S. degree.  It is clear that two major models for structuring
  graduate programs \r\n        in CSE have emerged, and that both have proven to
  be successful at various \r\n        universities. When considering the creation
  of a new program, the model \r\n        to be chosen and its chances for success
  will be highly dependent on local \r\n        academic strengths and political considerations.
  There is much in common \r\n        in terms of basic academic content between the
  two models.  Comparing the two models directly is difficult. We offer a few observations.
  \r\n        The degree in CSE may allow a more focused and cohesive program, since
  \r\n        this program is often implemented within a single department such as
  mathematics \r\n        or computer science, or within a separate academic unit.
  On the other \r\n        hand it may be difficult to achieve depth within this type
  of program, \r\n        especially for the application areas, or to distinguish
  this program from \r\n        applied mathematics.  Since CSE is an emerging area,
  employment possibilities for students \r\n        with the CSE degree are not well
  documented. There is a strong feeling \r\n        that the current climate is highly
  favorable toward interdisciplinary \r\n        work in science and engineering.
  One argument in favor of the degree in \r\n        traditional disciplines, with
  specialization in CSE, is that employers \r\n        and in particular universities
  and industry may be more open to this more \r\n        traditional degree structure.
  \ It is absolutely essential that interdisciplinary collaboration \r\n        be
  an integral part of the curriculum and the thesis research. There are \r\n        a
  number of ways in which this can be achieved.  The NSF National Partnership for
  Advanced Computational Infrastructure \r\n        (NPACIs) in the U.S. has programs
  in place to assist in CSE education. \r\n        Two excellent online news magazines
  provide up-to-date summaries of the \r\n        activities of the NPACIs: http://www.npaci.edu/npaci/online/
  \r\n        and the National Computational Science Alliance (NCSA) http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/.
  \r\n        The focused education programs are summarized through the cooperative
  \r\n        EOT-PACI (Education, Outreach and Training) Web Site for both PACIs
  http://www.eot.org/. \r\n        There are Research Experience for Undergraduates
  (REU) opportunities coordinated \r\n        through the EOT-PACI and details for
  applying are provided.  Recommendations regarding the potential role and contributions
