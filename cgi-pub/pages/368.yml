  United States government-backed by the overwhelming support of the American public-takes
  a hard line against international terrorism. The tenets of official U.S. counterterrorist
  policy are: make no concessions or deals with terrorists; bring them to justice
  for their crimes; isolate and apply pressure on states that sponsor terrorism; and
  bolster the counterterrorist capabilities of countries willing to work with the
  United States. While these tenets are sound principles, their application, specifically
  overseas, raises difficult questions. Does the \"no deal\" policy actually deter
  terrorists acts? Are there cases where agreements might reduce terrorism, while
  advancing other U.S. interests? Do isolation and pressure really force offending
  states to alter their support for terrorists? What factors affect the willingness,
  not just the capability, of foreign governments to help the United States in counterterrorism?
  In this critical study, a career CIA officer provides a guide to constructing and
  executing counterterrorist policy, urging that it be formulated as an integral part
  of broader U.S. foreign policy. In the first four chapters, Paul R. Pillar identifies
  the necessary elements of counterterrorist policy, he examines why the United States
  is a prime terrorist target, and he reveals why the counterterrorist policies that
  seem strongest are not always the most effective. Chapter 5 examines the widely
  varying nature of terrorist groups and the policy tools most appropriately applied
  to them. Chapter 6 focuses on states that sponsor terrorism (including Iran, Libya,
  North Korea, and Cuba), along with those that enable it to occur (particularly Greece
  and Pakistan). Pillar examines ways in which the American public''s perspective
  toward terrorism can actually constrain counterterrorist policy, and he concludes
  that terrorism cannot be \"defeated\" only reduced, attenuated, and to some degree,
  controlled. The final chapter summarizes his recommendations for amending U.S. policy.","my_library_url":"https://www.google.com/accounts/Login?service=print\u0026continue=https://books.google.com/books%3Fop%3Dlibrary%26ie%3DISO-8859-1\u0026hl=en","is_magazine":false,"is_public_domain":false},{"enableUserFeedbackUI":true,"pseudocontinuous":true,"asyncAdsEnabled":true,"currentVersion":"_a7c07564689f9256ef5d5e0a582d7d08","maxPrintablePages":20,"enableEmbedding":true,"addVol2CollectionBaseUrl":"https://books.google.com/books?op=add\u0026ie=ISO-8859-1\u0026sig=ACfU3U1yTkE3H2WKpxHvyqlDHc6w4PLg2Q\u0026id=_GYklwy6booC","removeVolFromCollectionBaseUrl":"https://books.google.com/books?op=remove\u0026ie=ISO-8859-1\u0026sig=ACfU3U2_54OlsqQSO5NYfvb3X7Qk5fWbYw\u0026id=_GYklwy6booC","enableFeedbackQuality":false,"enableP13n":true,"enablePlusOne":true,"purchaseHelpUrl":"https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/179845","is_cobrand":false,"sign_in_url":"https://www.google.com/accounts/Login?service=print\u0026continue=https://books.google.com/books%3Fid%3D_GYklwy6booC%26pg%3DPA57%26hl%3Den\u0026hl=en"},{"page":[{"pid":"PA57","flags":8,"order":74}]},null,null,{});var

  United States government-backed by the overwhelming support of the American public-takes
  a hard line against international terrorism. The tenets of official U.S. counterterrorist
  policy are: make no concessions or deals with terrorists; bring them to justice
  for their crimes; isolate and apply pressure on states that sponsor terrorism; and
  bolster the counterterrorist capabilities of countries willing to work with the
  United States. While these tenets are sound principles, their application, specifically
  overseas, raises difficult questions. Does the \"no deal\" policy actually deter
  terrorists acts? Are there cases where agreements might reduce terrorism, while
  advancing other U.S. interests? Do isolation and pressure really force offending
  states to alter their support for terrorists? What factors affect the willingness,
  not just the capability, of foreign governments to help the United States in counterterrorism?
  In this critical study, a career CIA officer provides a guide to constructing and
  executing counterterrorist policy, urging that it be formulated as an integral part
  of broader U.S. foreign policy. In the first four chapters, Paul R. Pillar identifies
  the necessary elements of counterterrorist policy, he examines why the United States
  is a prime terrorist target, and he reveals why the counterterrorist policies that
  seem strongest are not always the most effective. Chapter 5 examines the widely
  varying nature of terrorist groups and the policy tools most appropriately applied
  to them. Chapter 6 focuses on states that sponsor terrorism (including Iran, Libya,
  North Korea, and Cuba), along with those that enable it to occur (particularly Greece
  and Pakistan). Pillar examines ways in which the American public''s perspective
  toward terrorism can actually constrain counterterrorist policy, and he concludes
  that terrorism cannot be \"defeated\" only reduced, attenuated, and to some degree,
  controlled.
