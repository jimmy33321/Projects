  Terms and Concepts\r\n            Understanding the Scientific Process\r\n            Belief
  in Pseudoscience\r\n          U.S. middle and high school students may not do as
  well in math\r\n                and science as their counterparts in some other
  countries (see\r\n                chapter 1, \"Elementary and Secondary Education\").
  U.S.\r\n                adults, however, seem to be slightly or somewhat more knowledgeable\r\n
  \         about science than their counterparts in other countries.\r\n          It
  is\r\n            important to have some knowledge of basic scientific facts, concepts,\r\n
  \           and vocabulary. Those who possess such knowledge are able to\r\n            follow
  science news and participate in public discourse on science-related\r\n            issues.
  Having appreciation for the scientific process may be\r\n            even more important.
  Knowing how science works, i.e., understanding\r\n            how ideas are investigated
  and either accepted or rejected, is\r\n            valuable not only in keeping
  up with important science-related\r\n            issues and participating meaningfully
  in the political process,\r\n            but also in evaluating and assessing the
  validity of various\r\n            types of claims people encounter on a daily basis
  (including\r\n            those that are pseudoscientific) (Maienschein 1999).\r\n
  \         Surveys conducted\r\n            in the United States and other countries
  reveal that most citizens\r\n            do not have a firm grasp of basic scientific
  facts and concepts,\r\n            nor do they have an understanding of the scientific
  process. In addition,\r\n            belief in pseudoscience seems to be widespread,
  not only in the United\r\n            States but in other countries as well. This
  section explores these\r\n            three indicators of scientific literacy. (Scientific\r\n
  \           literacy is\r\n            defined here as knowing basic facts and concepts
  about science and\r\n            having an understanding of how science works.)[17]
  \r\n\t\t  Understanding Scientific Terms and Concepts\r\n          International
  Patterns and Trends\r\n          A substantial number of people throughout the world
  appear to\r\n                be unable to answer simple, science-related questions
  (figure 7-7 ; appendix table 7-10 ). Many did not know the correct answers\r\n            to
  several (mostly) true/false questions designed to test their basic\r\n          knowledge
  of science.\r\n          U.S. data do not show much change over\r\n            time
  in the public's level of knowledge about science. In contrast,\r\n            the
  most recent European data do show an increase. Belgium, Germany,\r\n            Ireland,
  Luxembourg, and the Netherlands recorded double-digit increases\r\n            in
  the percentage of correct responses between 1992 and 2005, and\r\n            most
  other European countries also recorded gains. There is considerable\r\n      variation
  in science knowledge across countries in Europe.[18]\r\n          Knowledge\r\n
  \           scores were especially low in China and Russia. For example, in China,\r\n
  \           less than half the respondents answered \"true\" to\r\n                the
  statements \"the center of the Earth is very hot\" and \"the\r\n                continents
  on which we live have been moving their location for\r\n                millions
  of years and will continue to move in the future.\"[19]            In\r\n                contrast,
  substantial majorities of the respondents in most other\r\n                countries
  answered these questions correctly (the question on\r\n                the center
  of the earth was not asked in Russia).[20]\r\n          On two\r\n            questions,
  U.S. survey participants did considerably better than\r\n            their counterparts
  in other countries:\r\n          More than 70% of Americans correctly answered \"false\"
  to\r\n                the statement \"all radioactivity is manmade.\" In the\r\n
  \               other countries, the percentage of correct responses was considerably\r\n
  \               lower.\r\n\t\t\tOnly in the United States, Europe, and South Korea
  did a majority\r\n                  correctly answer true to the statement \"it
  is the father's\r\n                  gene that decides whether the baby is a boy
  or a girl.\" The\r\n                  percentage of correct responses in other countries
  ranged from\r\n                  46% for Malaysia to 22% for Russia. In addition,
  the number of\r\n                  Europeans who answered this question correctly
  increased significantly\r\n                  between 2001 and 2005.Less than half
  the respondents in each country knew that \"lasers\r\n                    [do not]
  work by focusing sound waves.\" In contrast,\r\n                    most people
  seem to know that the Earth goes around the Sun\r\n            (and not vice versa).\r\n
  \         One question in particular shows a\r\n                    notable increase
  in the percentage of correct responses in\r\n                    both the United
  States and Europe: more people now know that\r\n                    antibiotics
  do not kill viruses. In 2001, for the first time,\r\n                    a majority
  (51%) of U.S. respondents answered this question\r\n                    correctly,
  up from 40% in 1995. In the United States, correct\r\n                    responses
  increased to 54% in 2004. In Europe, 46% of respondents\r\n              answered
  the question correctly in 2005, compared with 40% in 2001\r\n              and only
  27% in 1992.\r\n          The U.S. survey is the only one in which\r\n            at
  least half the participants answered the question about antibiotics\r\n            and
  viruses correctly. After Europe, the next highest percentage\r\n            of correct
  responses was in South Korea (30%), followed by Japan\r\n            (23%) and Malaysia
  (21%). Less than one in five Russian and Chinese\r\n        respondents (18%) knew
  that antibiotics do not kill viruses.\r\n          The promising\r\n            trend
  in knowledge about antibiotics and viruses in the United States\r\n            and
  Europe suggests that a public health campaign to educate the\r\n            public
  about the increasing resistance of bacteria to antibiotics\r\n            has been
  working. This problem has been the subject of widespread\r\n            media coverage,
  and when stories mention that the main culprit is\r\n            the overprescribing
  of antibiotics, they typically note the fact\r\n            that antibiotics are
  ineffective in killing viruses. In addition,\r\n            parents of young children,
  especially those prone to ear infections,\r\n            have been warned by their
  pediatricians about this problem. However,\r\n            the message still has
  not reached a large segment of the population\r\n  throughout the world.\r\n          Americans
  apparently are also becoming more\r\n            familiar with the terminology of
  genetics. In a 2001 NSF survey,\r\n            45% of respondents were able to define
  DNA. The percentage of correct\r\n            responses to this survey question
  increased in the late 1990s, a\r\n            trend that probably reflected heavy
  media coverage of DNA use in\r\n            forensics and medical research. More
  recently, a 2003 Harris poll\r\n            found that 60% of adults in the United
  States selected the correct\r\n            answer when asked \"what\r\n                    is
  DNA?\" (the genetic code for living cells), and two-thirds\r\n                    chose
  the right answer when asked \"what does DNA stand\r\n                    for?\"
  (deoxyribonucleic\r\n                    acid) (kSERO Corporation, Inc. 2003). As
  mentioned earlier\r\n                    in the chapter, a popular television entertainment
  show such\r\n                    as CSI increases public understanding of DNA (see
  sidebar, \"Television\r\n                    and Other Forms of Popular Culture
  Influence What Adults\r\nKnow and Think about Science.\")\r\n          In the United
  States,\r\n            knowledge about science is positively related to level of\r\n
  \           formal schooling, income level, and number of science and\r\n            math
  courses taken. In addition, younger respondents and\r\n            those without
  minor children at home were more likely than\r\n            others to have answered
  the questions correctly. Finally,\r\n            men seem to be more knowledgeable
  about science than women:\r\n            in 2004, men scored an average of 65%,
  compared with 55%\r\n            for women (appendix tables 7-11  and 7-12 ).\r\n
  \         Evolution and the \"Big Bang\"\r\n          Americans were less likely
  than residents of other countries to\r\n                answer \"true\" to the following
  scientific knowledge\r\n                questions: \"human\r\n                beings,
  as we know them today, developed from earlier species\r\n                of animals\"
  and \"the universe began with a huge explosion.\" In\r\n                the United
  States, 44% of the respondents in an NSF-sponsored\r\n                survey answered
  \"true\" to the first question in 2004,\r\n                about the same level
  recorded in every year (except one) that\r\n                the question has been
  asked. In contrast, 78% of Japanese respondents\r\n                answered \"true,\"
  as\r\n                did 70% of the Chinese and European respondents and more than\r\n
  \               60% of the South Korean and Malaysian respondents. Only in Russia\r\n
  \               did less than half (44%) of respondents answer \"true.\" Similarly,\r\n
  \               Americans were less likely than other survey respondents (except\r\n
  \           the Chinese) to answer \"true\" to the \"big bang\" question.\r\n          U.S.\r\n
  \               responses to questions about evolution and the big bang appear\r\n
  \             to reflect more than unfamiliarity with basic elements of science.\r\n
  \             The 2004 Michigan Survey of Consumer Attitudes administered two\r\n
  \             different versions of these questions to different groups of respondents.\r\n
  \             Some were asked questions that tested knowledge about the natural\r\n
  \             world (\"human beings, as we know them today, developed from\r\n                earlier
  species of animals\" and \"the universe began\r\n                with a big explosion\").
  Others were asked questions that\r\n                tested knowledge about what
  a scientific theory asserts or a\r\n                group of scientists believes
  (\"according to the theory of\r\n                evolution, human beings, as we
  know them today, developed from\r\n                earlier species of animals\"
  and \"according to astronomers,\r\n                the universe began with a big
  explosion\"). Respondents were\r\n                much more likely to answer correctly
  if the question was framed\r\n                as about scientific theories or beliefs
  rather than as about\r\n                the natural world. When the question about
  evolution was prefaced\r\n                by \"according to\r\n                the
  theory of evolution,\" 74% marked true; only 44% marked\r\n                true
  when it was not. Similarly, 62% agreed with the prefaced\r\n                question
  about the big bang, but only 35% agreed when the prefatory\r\n                phrase
  was omitted. These differences probably indicate that\r\n                many Americans
  hold religious beliefs that cause them to be skeptical\r\n                of established
  scientific ideas, even when they have some basic\r\n            familiarity with
  those ideas.\r\n          Surveys conducted by the Gallup\r\n                Organization
  provide similar evidence. An ongoing Gallup survey,\r\n                conducted
  most recently in 2004, found that only about a third\r\n                of Americans
  agreed that Darwin's theory of evolution has been\r\n                well supported
  by evidence (Newport\r\n                2004).[21] The same percentage\r\n                agreed
  with the alternative statement that Darwin's theory was\r\n                not supported
  by the evidence, and an additional 29% said they\r\n                didn't know
  enough to say. Data from 2001 were similar. Those\r\n                agreeing with
  the first statement were more likely than others\r\n                to be men, well
  educated (65% of those with postgraduate education\r\n                and 52% of
  those with a bachelor's degree), and live in the West\r\n            (47%) or East
  (42%).\r\n          In response to another group of questions\r\n            on
  evolution asked by Gallup in 2004, about half (51%) of those surveyed\r\n            agreed
  with either of two statements compatible with evolution: that\r\n              human
  beings developed over millions of years either with or\r\n              without
  God's guidance in the process. However, 45% agreed with\r\n              a third
  statement, that \"God created human beings pretty much\r\n              in their
  present form at one time within the last 10,000 years\r\n              or so.\"
  These\r\n                views on the origin of human beings have remained virtually
  unchanged\r\n                (in six surveys) since the questions were first asked
  in 1982\r\n            (Newport 2004).\r\n          During most of the 20th century,
  probably the most\r\n              contentious issue related to the teaching of
  science has been whether\r\n              and how evolution is to be taught in U.S.
  public school classrooms.[22],\r\n              [23] The\r\n              controversy
  has continued in the new millennium, erupting in quite\r\n              a few states,
  including Georgia and Pennsylvania, and making front-page\r\n              headlines
  in major newspapers.[24]            A survey conducted in 2005 revealed that Americans
  have been paying\r\n            fairly close attention to newspaper and television
  news coverage\r\n            about teaching alternatives to evolution (Nisbet\r\n
  \             and Nisbet 2005). Contention about this issue\r\n          also surfaced
  in England in 2001 and in the Netherlands in 2005.\r\n          (See sidebar, \"More
  Than a Century After Darwin, Evolution\r\n            Still Under Attack in Science
  Classrooms\")\r\nTop of page \r\n          Understanding the Scientific Process\r\n
  \         NSF has used three survey items to assess \"public understanding\r\n                of
  the nature of scientific inquiry,\" i.e., how well people\r\n                understand
  aspects of the scientific process. Understanding how\r\n                science
  works is a major indicator of scientific literacy. Based\r\n                on their
  responses to the three inquiry items, many Americans\r\n                appear not
  to have a firm grasp of the nature of the scientific\r\n            process. The
  same is true of Europeans.\r\n          In 2001, both the NSF\r\n            survey
  and the Eurobarometer asked respondents questions designed\r\n            to test
  their knowledge of two important aspects of scientific\r\n            literacy:
  how an experiment is conducted and their understanding\r\n            of probability.[25]
  Only\r\n            43% of Americans and 37% of Europeans answered the experiment
  question\r\n            correctly. Both groups did better with probability: 57%
  of Americans\r\n            and 69% of Europeans answered that question correctly.
  In 2004, 46%\r\n            of Americans answered the experiment question correctly,
  and 64%\r\n            gave a correct answer to the probability questions (appendix\r\n
  \           table 7-13 ).\r\n            NSF survey respondents were also asked
  to explain in their own words\r\n            what it means to study something scientifically.
  In 2004, only 23%\r\n            of respondents gave a response that indicated they
  knew what it meant.[26]\r\n          Although\r\n            39% of Americans surveyed
  in 2004 correctly answered all three questions\r\n            about the nature of
  scientific inquiry, 61% did not.[27] This lack\r\n            of understanding may
  explain why a substantial portion of the population\r\n            believes in various
  forms of pseudoscience. \r\nTop of page \r\n          Belief in Pseudoscience\r\n
  \         Although S&T are held in high esteem throughout the modern\r\n                world,
  pseudoscientific beliefs continue to thrive. Such beliefs\r\n                coexist
  alongside society's professed respect for science and\r\n            the scientific
  process.\r\n          A recent study of 20 years of survey data\r\n            collected
  by NSF concluded that \"many Americans accept pseudoscientific\r\n            beliefs,\"
  such\r\n                as astrology, lucky numbers, the existence of unidentified
  flying\r\n                objects (UFOs), extrasensory perception (ESP), and magnetic
  therapy\r\n                (Losh et al. 2003). Such beliefs indicate a lack of understanding\r\n
  \               of how science works and how evidence is investigated and subsequently\r\n
  \               determined to be either valid or not. Scientists, educators,\r\n
  \           and others are concerned that people have not acquired the critical\r\n
  \               thinking skills they need to distinguish fact from fiction. The\r\n
  \               science community and those whose job it is to communicate information\r\n
  \               about science to the public have been particularly concerned\r\n
  \           about the public's susceptibility to unproven claims that could adversely\r\n
  \               affect their health, safety, and pocketbooks (NIST 2002). (See\r\n
  \           sidebar, \"Sense About Science.\")\r\n          Pseudoscience has been\r\n
  \               defined as \"claims presented so that\r\n                they appear
  [to be] scientific even though they lack supporting\r\n                evidence
  and plausibility\" (Shermer\r\n                1997, p. 33).[28] In contrast,\r\n
  \               science is \"a set of methods designed to describe and interpret\r\n
  \               observed and inferred phenomena, past or present, and aimed at\r\n
  \               building a testable body of knowledge open to rejection or confirmation\"
  (Shermer\r\n            1997, p. 17).\r\n          Belief in pseudoscience increased
  significantly\r\n                during the 1990s and into the early part of this
  decade (Newport\r\n                and Strausberg 2001) and then fell somewhat between
  2001\r\n                and 2005 (figure 7-8 ).\r\n                The largest declines
  were in the number of people who believe\r\n                in ESP, clairvoyance,
  ghosts, mentally communicating with the\r\n                dead, and channeling. 
  Nevertheless, about three-fourths\r\n                of Americans hold at least
  one pseudoscientific belief; i.e.,\r\n                they believed in at least
  1 of the 10 survey items (similar to\r\n                the percentage recorded
  in 2001).[29]            In addition, 22% believed in five or more of the items,
  32% believed\r\n            in four, and 57% believed in two. However, only 1% believed
  in\r\n            all 10 (Moore 2005b).\r\n          Belief\r\n                in
  pseudoscience is widespread. For example, at least a quarter\r\n                of
  the U.S. population believes in astrology, i.e., that the\r\n                position
  of the stars and planets can affect people's lives.\r\n                Although
  two-thirds (66%) of those queried in 2004 said that\r\n                astrology
  is \"not at all scientific,\" about one-third\r\n                considered it at
  least \"sort of scientific\" (appendix\r\n            table 7-14 ).[30]\r\n          Belief
  in astrology may be more prevalent in Europe.\r\n                In 2001, 53% of
  Europeans surveyed thought astrology is \"rather\r\n                scientific\"
  and\r\n                only a minority (39%) said it is not at all scientific. In
  the\r\n                2005 survey, Europeans were asked whether or not they considered\r\n
  \               certain subjects to be scientific, using a 5-point scale (with\r\n
  \               higher values indicating that a subject is more scientific).\r\n
  \               About 4 out of 10 (41%) of those surveyed gave responses of 4\r\n
  \               or 5 for astrology, the same as the score for economics. However,\r\n
  \               when the survey used the word \"horoscopes\" instead\r\n                of
  astrology, only 13% gave a response of 4 or 5. Disciplines\r\n                most
  likely to be considered scientific by Europeans were medicine\r\n                (89%),
  physics (83%), biology (75%), mathematics (72%), astronomy\r\n                (70%),
  and psychology (53%). History (34%) and homeopathy (33%)\r\n                were
  at the bottom of the list (European Commission 2005a). Comparable\r\n            U.S.
  data on the various disciplines do not exist.\r\n          Europeans\r\n                were
  more likely than Americans to agree that \"some\r\n                numbers are particularly
  lucky for some people.\" The percentages\r\n            in Europe were 37% (2005)
  and 32% (2001).[31]\r\n          In the United States,\r\n                skepticism
  about astrology is strongly related to level of education:\r\n                in
  2004, 81% of college graduates said that astrology is \"not\r\n                at
  all scientific,\" compared with 51%\r\n                of those with less than a
  high school education and 62% of those\r\n                who had completed high
  school but not college. In Europe, however,\r\n                respondents with
  college degrees were just as likely as others\r\n            to claim that astrology
  is scientific.\r\n          In the United States, belief\r\n                in astrology
  is also related to level of income (which, in turn,\r\n                is related
  to education). Those in higher income brackets were\r\n                less likely
  than others to say that astrology is either very\r\n            or sort of scientific.\r\n
  \         Like astrology in the United States and\r\n            Europe, fortune
  telling is common in China and South Korea. However,\r\n            only 1% of Chinese
  survey respondents said fortune telling is very\r\n            scientific and 10%
  thought it is \"a bit\" scientific. In\r\n            contrast, 74% answered either
  \"not at all scientific\" or \"not\r\n                very scientific.\" A similar
  item on a South Korean survey\r\n                showed a larger percentage (37%)
  of respondents answering either \"very\r\n                scientific\" or \"sort
  of scientific\" (figure 7-9 ;\r\n                appendix table 7-15 ).\r\n          Surveys
  conducted by NSF and other organizations suggest that at\r\n            least half
  of the U.S. public believes in the existence of ESP (CBS\r\n            News 2002),
  and a sizable minority believes in UFOs and that aliens\r\n            have landed
  on Earth. In the 2001 NSF survey, 60% of respondents\r\n            agreed that
  \  \"some people possess psychic powers or ESP,\" and\r\n                  30% agreed
  that \"some of the unidentified flying objects that\r\n                  have been
  reported are really space vehicles from other civilizations.\" Similarly,\r\n                  one-third
  of the Chinese respondents (33%) believed in the existence\r\n          of aliens.
  \         Top of page \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Than a Century After Darwin, \r\nEvolution
  Still Under Attack in Science Classrooms\r\nIn 1999, the Kansas State Board of Education
  decided to delete evolution\r\n            from the state's science standards. The
  action received widespread\r\n            press coverage and sparked an outcry in
  the science community. Most\r\n            of the public also disagreed with the
  decision, which was reversed\r\n            after board members who had voted for
  the change were defeated in\r\n          the next election.\r\nThus began another
  round of attacks on the teaching\r\n  of evolution in public school classrooms.
  Similar eruptions have been occurring\r\n  since the landmark 1925 Scopes \"monkey\"
  trial. Although\r\n  Tennessee teacher John Scopes was convicted, science ended
  up being\r\n  the true victor, according to the history books and thanks to the\r\n
  \ play Inherit the Wind. The next milestone occurred in 1987 when the\r\n  Supreme
  Court struck down a Louisiana law that prohibited the teaching\r\n  of evolution
  unless equal time was given to creationism.\r\nThe National Center\r\n  for Science
  Education (NCSE) tracks attacks on the teaching of evolution in\r\n  the United
  States and around the world. In general, the recent controversies\r\n  have come
  from two directions: a push to introduce \"intelligent design\" in\r\n  science
  classrooms as a viable alternative to evolution[*] and efforts to add\r\n  evolution
  disclaimers to science textbooks. Recently, legislatures or school\r\n  boards in
  about 20 states have considered allowing the teaching of\r\n  alternatives to evolution
  in science classrooms. Controversies making\r\n  national headlines include the
  following:\r\nIn October 2004, the Dover, Pennsylvania,\r\n    school district became
  the first in the nation to require that ninth-graders\r\n    be told about intelligent
  design in biology class. The decision triggered a\r\n    lawsuit. The parents of
  several students are suing the school board; the American\r\n    Civil Liberties
  Union and Americans United for the Separation of\r\n    Church and State are representing
  them. The trial is scheduled for\r\n    September 2005.\r\n  Six years after the
  initial controversy, Kansas\r\n    is once again taking up the issue. This time,
  the state education board is\r\n    considering adding intelligent design to its
  science standards. Representatives\r\n    of the scientific community boycotted
  hearings on the subject, held\r\n    in May 2005, because \"participating in them
  would only strengthen\r\n    the idea in some minds that there was a serious debate
  in science\r\n    about the power of the theory of evolution\" (Dean\r\n    2005).
  The\r\n    final vote on the Kansas science standards is also scheduled for\r\n
  \   September 2005.\r\n  In 2002, the school board in Cobb County, Georgia, decided\r\n
  \   that every biology textbook in the state would have a sticker declaring\r\n
  \   that \"evolution is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origin\r\n    of living
  things.\" A lawsuit was filed by parents of the students,\r\n    and a trial was
  held in late 2004. In January 2005, the judge in\r\n    the case ruled the evolution
  disclaimer unconstitutional and ordered\r\n    the stickers removed. The school
  district is appealing the decision.\r\n    Currently, Alabama is the only state
  requiring evolution disclaimer\r\n  stickers on biology textbooks.\r\nIn addition
  to the way science is taught (or\r\n  not taught) in classrooms,[†] battles\r\n
  \ over other issues have erupted in other places in recent years:\r\nIn several\r\n
  \   cities, IMAX theaters have declined to screen films such as Cosmic\r\n    Voyage,\r\n
  \   Galapagos, and Volcanoes of the Deep Sea because of community opposition\r\n
  \   to the films' treatment of evolution as fact (Dean\r\n    2005).\r\n  Several
  science organizations\r\n    protested the sale of a book promoting creationism,
  Grand\r\n    Canyon: A Different View at the Grand Canyon, at the National Park
  Service bookstore. The National\r\n    Park Service is reviewing the issue. \r\n
  \ The Smithsonian Institution screened\r\n    the film The Privileged Planet in
  June 2005, but not before drawing criticism\r\n    from a variety of science organizations
  because the authors of the book on\r\n    which the film is based are affiliated
  with a pro-intelligent-design think\r\n    tank. After the protests, the museum
  withdrew its cosponsorship and\r\n    returned the organization's donation because
  it \"determined\r\n    that the content of the film is not consistent with the mission
  of\r\n    the Smithsonian Institution's scientific research.\" \r\n  In June 2005,
  the\r\n    Park and Recreation Board of Tulsa, Oklahoma, voted to approve a display\r\n
  \   depicting the Biblical account of creation at the city's zoo. The decision\r\n
  \   was reversed a month later (NCSE 2005).This kind of controversy is almost absent
  in other industrialized\r\n      nations. However, that may be changing. For example,
  since 2002,\r\n      the teaching of creationism at a small group of privately financed\r\n
  \     state schools in northeast England has triggered a considerable amount\r\n
  \     of debate in Parliament (Pincock 2005).\r\n    \r\n\t[*] The theory of intelligent
  design\r\n      holds that life is too complex to have happened by chance and that,
  therefore,\r\n      some sort of intelligent designer must be responsible. Critics
  claim that\r\n      this theory is simply a more sophisticated form of creationism
  (which the\r\n      courts have said may not be taught in public schools). They
  argue that\r\n      intelligent design theory has nothing to do with science because
  its assertions\r\n      are not falsiable: they cannot be tested or observed and
  cannot undergo\r\n      experimentation. In contrast, \"[evolution] has been directly\r\n
  \     observed in operation not only in the laboratory but also in the\r\n      field.
  Where there is still room for argument and discussion is in\r\n      the precise
  contributions of different mechanisms to evolutionary\r\n      change. In this vibrant
  debate, intelligent design offers no meaningful\r\n      contribution.\" According
  to Eugenie C. Scott, president of the\r\n      National Center for Science Education,
  \"There aren't any alternative\r\n      scientic theories to evolution.\" In October
  2002, the American\r\n      Association for the Advancement of Science Board of
  Directors passed\r\n      a resolution on intelligent design that \"calls upon its
  members\r\n      to assist those engaged in overseeing science education policy
  to\r\n      understand the nature of science, the content of contemporary evolutionary\r\n
  \     theory and the inappropriateness of 'intelligent design theory' as\r\n      a
  subject matter for science education.\"\r\n    [†] Although they are using teaching
  guides and textbooks that meet the\r\n      approval of biologists, some teachers
  avoid mentioning evolution in their\r\n      classrooms because their superintendents
  or principals discourage them\r\n      from discussing it or because of opposition
  in the communities in which they\r\n      teach. This approach can take the form
  of assigning the material on evolution\r\n      to be read, but not discussing it
  in class (Dean\r\n      2005)\r\n\t\r\n\r\nTop of page \r\n\r\n\r\nSense About Science\r\n
  \           A new group, Sense About Science, was recently formed in the United\r\n
  \             Kingdom. Its goal is to help scientists and their institutions\r\n
  \             educate the press and the public about the importance of peer review.\r\n
  \             Recent scares-such as the possibility that radiation from mobile\r\n
  \             phones poses health risks, that the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella)\r\n
  \             vaccine can cause autism, and that acrylamide in fried foods can\r\n
  \             cause cancer-could be put into perspective if the press and the\r\n
  \             public understood how the scientific process is used to distinguish\r\n
  \             between claims that are valid and those that are not. A poll commissioned\r\n
  \             in 2004 by the Science Media Centre and the journal Nature and\r\n
  \             conducted by the London-based market-research company MORI revealed\r\n
  \             that almost three-fourths of the UK public does not know what peer\r\n
  \             review is. Sense About Science plans to work with research and\r\n
  \             educational bodies to encourage teaching about peer review in schools\r\n
  \             and universities (Sense About Science 2004).\r\nTop of page \r\n          Footnotes\r\n
  \           \r\n            [17] Researchers have concluded\r\n              that
  fewer than one-fifth of Americans meet a minimal standard\r\n            of civic
  scientific literacy (Miller, Pardo, and Niwa 1997).\r\n            [18]              In
  Europe, residents of Sweden, the Czech Republic, Finland, the\r\n              Netherlands,
  Norway, Denmark, and Slovenia have the highest rates\r\n            of scientific
  knowledge, and Portugal, Malta, Latvia, Bulgaria, Cyprus\r\n            and Turkey
  the lowest. Also, in Europe, men, persons between the\r\n            ages of 15
  and 54, those with more years of formal schooling, and\r\n            those who
  do not attend religious services are more likely than others\r\n            to provide
  correct responses to questions designed to test their\r\n            knowledge of
  science (European Commission\r\n            2005a).  \r\n            [19] In China,
  only 1.4% of the population\r\n              possessed basic scientific literacy
  in 2001. The percentage was\r\n              higher among men (1.7%) and urban residents
  (3.1%) (Chinese\r\n              Ministry of Science and Technology 2002).\r\n            [20]
  In its own international comparison\r\n              of scientific literacy, Japan
  ranked itself 10th of 14 countries\r\n              included in the report (National
  Institute\r\n              of Science and Technology Policy 2002).\r\n            [21]
  A recent analysis of public\r\n              opinion concerning evolution suggests
  that \"many members of\r\n              the public underestimate the scientific
  evidence in support of\r\n              evolution and overestimate the evidence
  supporting intelligent\r\n              design\" (Nisbet and Nisbet\r\n            2005).\r\n
  \           [22] The cover of the November 2004\r\n              issue of National
  Geographic Magazine asked \"Was Darwin Wrong?\" The\r\n              33-page article
  concluded that \"[t]he evidence for evolution\r\n              is overwhelming.\"\r\n
  \           [23]              The National Science Board issued a statement on the
  subject in\r\n            August 1999 (National Science Board 1999). \r\n            [24]
  In a 2005 CBS/New\r\n              York Times poll, 57% of those surveyed favored
  teaching creationism\r\n              along with evolution in public schools, down
  from 65% 4 months\r\n              earlier. In the same 2005 poll, 35% favored teaching
  creationism\r\n              instead of evolution in public schools, down from 37%
  in the previous\r\n              survey. About half of those surveyed in both 2004
  and 2005 opposed\r\n            teaching creationism instead of evolution. \r\n
  \           [25] The\r\n              question pertaining to experimental evaluation
  was: \"Now,\r\n            please think of this situation. Two scientists want to
  know if a\r\n            certain drug is effective in treating high blood pressure.
  The first\r\n            scientist wants to give the drug to 1,000 people with high
  blood\r\n            pressure and see how many experience lower blood pressure levels.\r\n
  \           The second scientist wants to give the drug to 500 people with high\r\n
  \           blood pressure, and not give the drug to another 500 people with\r\n
  \           high blood pressure, and see how many in both groups experience lower\r\n
  \           blood pressure levels. Which is the better way to test this drug?\r\n
  \           Why is it better to test the drug this way?\"\r\n            The text
  of the\r\n            probability question in 2004 was: \"Now think\r\n            about
  this situation. A doctor tells a couple that their 'genetic\r\n            makeup'
  means that they've got one in four chances of having a child\r\n            with
  an inherited illness. Does this mean that if their first child\r\n            has
  the illness, the next three will not? Does this mean that each\r\n            of
  the couple's children will have the same risk of suffering from\r\n            the
  illness?\"\r\n            [26] Correct explanations of scientific\r\n              study
  include responses describing it as theory testing, experimentation,\r\n              or
  rigorous, systematic comparison.\r\n            [27] Similar to questions about
  scientific\r\n              facts and concepts, younger respondents, those with
  more formal\r\n              education and higher incomes, and those without minor
  children\r\n              at home were more likely than others to give correct responses\r\n
  \             to questions about the scientific process (appendix\r\n              table
  7-13).\r\n            [28]              According to one group studying such phenomena,
  pseudoscientific\r\n            topics include yogi flying, therapeutic touch, astrology,
  fire walking,\r\n            voodoo magical thinking, alternative medicine, channeling,
  Carlos\r\n            hoax, psychic hotlines and detectives, near-death experiences,
  unidentified\r\n            flying objects and alien abductions, the Bermuda Triangle,
  homeopathy,\r\n            faith healing, and reincarnation (Committee\r\n            for
  the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal 2003).\r\n            [29]
  Those 10 items were extrasensory\r\n              perception (ESP), that houses
  can be haunted, ghosts/that spirits\r\n              of dead people can come back
  in certain places/situations, telepathy/communication\r\n              between minds
  without using traditional senses, clairvoyance/the\r\n              power of the
  mind to know the past and predict the future, astrology/that\r\n              the
  position of the stars and planets can affect people's lives,\r\n              that
  people can communicate mentally with someone who has died,\r\n              witches,
  reincarnation/the rebirth of the soul in a new body after\r\n              death,
  and channeling/allowing a \"spirit-being\" to temporarily\r\n            assume
  control of a body.\r\n            [30] In the 2001 NSF survey, 56%\r\n              of
  those surveyed agreed that astrology is \"not at all scientific,\" 9%\r\n              said
  it is \"very scientific,\" and\r\n            31% thought it \"sort of scientific.\"
  The difference between\r\n            the 2001 and 2004 data may be attributable
  to differences in questionnaire\r\n            design in the 2 years. \r\n            [31]
  Countries with the highest levels\r\n              of agreement were Italy, Latvia,
  the Czech Republic, Ireland, and\r\n              Austria. The \"least\r\n            convinced\"
  were\r\n            in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Finland (European\r\n            Commission
  2005a).\r\n\t\t\t    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n      \r\n        Previous page\r\n\r\n

  Figure 7-7   Figure 7-8 Figure 7-9  Print this chapter (1.0MB)U.S. middle and high
  school students may not do as well in math\r\n                and science as their
  counterparts in some other countries (see\r\n                chapter 1, \"Elementary
  and Secondary Education\"). U.S.\r\n                adults, however, seem to be
  slightly or somewhat more knowledgeable\r\n          about science than their counterparts
  in other countries.It is\r\n            important to have some knowledge of basic
  scientific facts, concepts,\r\n            and vocabulary. Those who possess such
  knowledge are able to\r\n            follow science news and participate in public
  discourse on science-related\r\n            issues. Having appreciation for the
  scientific process may be\r\n            even more important. Knowing how science
  works, i.e., understanding\r\n            how ideas are investigated and either
  accepted or rejected, is\r\n            valuable not only in keeping up with important
  science-related\r\n            issues and participating meaningfully in the political
  process,\r\n            but also in evaluating and assessing the validity of various\r\n
  \           types of claims people encounter on a daily basis (including\r\n            those
  that are pseudoscientific) (Maienschein 1999).Surveys conducted\r\n            in
  the United States and other countries reveal that most citizens\r\n            do
  not have a firm grasp of basic scientific facts and concepts,\r\n            nor
  do they have an understanding of the scientific process. In addition,\r\n            belief
  in pseudoscience seems to be widespread, not only in the United\r\n            States
  but in other countries as well. This section explores these\r\n            three
  indicators of scientific literacy. (Scientific\r\n            literacy is\r\n            defined
  here as knowing basic facts and concepts about science and\r\n            having
  an understanding of how science works.)[17] International Patterns and TrendsA substantial
  number of people throughout the world appear to\r\n                be unable to
  answer simple, science-related questions (figure 7-7 ; appendix table 7-10 ). Many
  did not know the correct answers\r\n            to several (mostly) true/false questions
  designed to test their basic\r\n          knowledge of science.U.S. data do not
  show much change over\r\n            time in the public's level of knowledge about
  science. In contrast,\r\n            the most recent European data do show an increase.
  Belgium, Germany,\r\n            Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands recorded
  double-digit increases\r\n            in the percentage of correct responses between
  1992 and 2005, and\r\n            most other European countries also recorded gains.
  There is considerable\r\n      variation in science knowledge across countries in
  Europe.[18]Knowledge\r\n            scores were especially low in China and Russia.
  For example, in China,\r\n            less than half the respondents answered \"true\"
  to\r\n                the statements \"the center of the Earth is very hot\" and
  \"the\r\n                continents on which we live have been moving their location
  for\r\n                millions of years and will continue to move in the future.\"[19]
  \           In\r\n                contrast, substantial majorities of the respondents
  in most other\r\n                countries answered these questions correctly (the
  question on\r\n                the center of the earth was not asked in Russia).[20]On
  two\r\n            questions, U.S. survey participants did considerably better than\r\n
  \           their counterparts in other countries:Less than half the respondents
  in each country knew that \"lasers\r\n                    [do not] work by focusing
  sound waves.\" In contrast,\r\n                    most people seem to know that
  the Earth goes around the Sun\r\n            (and not vice versa).One question in
  particular shows a\r\n                    notable increase in the percentage of
  correct responses in\r\n                    both the United States and Europe: more
  people now know that\r\n                    antibiotics do not kill viruses. In
  2001, for the first time,\r\n                    a majority (51%) of U.S. respondents
  answered this question\r\n                    correctly, up from 40% in 1995. In
  the United States, correct\r\n                    responses increased to 54% in
  2004. In Europe, 46% of respondents\r\n              answered the question correctly
  in 2005, compared with 40% in 2001\r\n              and only 27% in 1992.The U.S.
  survey is the only one in which\r\n            at least half the participants answered
  the question about antibiotics\r\n            and viruses correctly. After Europe,
  the next highest percentage\r\n            of correct responses was in South Korea
  (30%), followed by Japan\r\n            (23%) and Malaysia (21%). Less than one
  in five Russian and Chinese\r\n        respondents (18%) knew that antibiotics do
  not kill viruses.The promising\r\n            trend in knowledge about antibiotics
  and viruses in the United States\r\n            and Europe suggests that a public
  health campaign to educate the\r\n            public about the increasing resistance
  of bacteria to antibiotics\r\n            has been working. This problem has been
  the subject of widespread\r\n            media coverage, and when stories mention
  that the main culprit is\r\n            the overprescribing of antibiotics, they
  typically note the fact\r\n            that antibiotics are ineffective in killing
  viruses. In addition,\r\n            parents of young children, especially those
  prone to ear infections,\r\n            have been warned by their pediatricians
  about this problem. However,\r\n            the message still has not reached a
  large segment of the population\r\n  throughout the world.Americans apparently are
  also becoming more\r\n            familiar with the terminology of genetics. In
  a 2001 NSF survey,\r\n            45% of respondents were able to define DNA. The
  percentage of correct\r\n            responses to this survey question increased
  in the late 1990s, a\r\n            trend that probably reflected heavy media coverage
  of DNA use in\r\n            forensics and medical research. More recently, a 2003
  Harris poll\r\n            found that 60% of adults in the United States selected
  the correct\r\n            answer when asked \"what\r\n                    is DNA?\"
  (the genetic code for living cells), and two-thirds\r\n                    chose
  the right answer when asked \"what does DNA stand\r\n                    for?\"
  (deoxyribonucleic\r\n                    acid) (kSERO Corporation, Inc. 2003). As
  mentioned earlier\r\n                    in the chapter, a popular television entertainment
  show such\r\n                    as CSI increases public understanding of DNA (see
  sidebar, \"Television\r\n                    and Other Forms of Popular Culture
  Influence What Adults\r\nKnow and Think about Science.\")In the United States,\r\n
  \           knowledge about science is positively related to level of\r\n            formal
  schooling, income level, and number of science and\r\n            math courses taken.
  In addition, younger respondents and\r\n            those without minor children
  at home were more likely than\r\n            others to have answered the questions
  correctly. Finally,\r\n            men seem to be more knowledgeable about science
  than women:\r\n            in 2004, men scored an average of 65%, compared with
  55%\r\n            for women (appendix tables 7-11  and 7-12 ).Evolution and the
  \"Big Bang\"Americans were less likely than residents of other countries to\r\n
  \               answer \"true\" to the following scientific knowledge\r\n                questions:
  \"human\r\n                beings, as we know them today, developed from earlier
  species\r\n                of animals\" and \"the universe began with a huge explosion.\"
  In\r\n                the United States, 44% of the respondents in an NSF-sponsored\r\n
  \               survey answered \"true\" to the first question in 2004,\r\n                about
  the same level recorded in every year (except one) that\r\n                the question
  has been asked. In contrast, 78% of Japanese respondents\r\n                answered
  \"true,\" as\r\n                did 70% of the Chinese and European respondents
  and more than\r\n                60% of the South Korean and Malaysian respondents.
  Only in Russia\r\n                did less than half (44%) of respondents answer
  \"true.\" Similarly,\r\n                Americans were less likely than other survey
  respondents (except\r\n            the Chinese) to answer \"true\" to the \"big
  bang\" question.U.S.\r\n                responses to questions about evolution and
  the big bang appear\r\n              to reflect more than unfamiliarity with basic
  elements of science.\r\n              The 2004 Michigan Survey of Consumer Attitudes
  administered two\r\n              different versions of these questions to different
  groups of respondents.\r\n              Some were asked questions that tested knowledge
  about the natural\r\n              world (\"human beings, as we know them today,
  developed from\r\n                earlier species of animals\" and \"the universe
  began\r\n                with a big explosion\"). Others were asked questions that\r\n
  \               tested knowledge about what a scientific theory asserts or a\r\n
  \               group of scientists believes (\"according to the theory of\r\n                evolution,
  human beings, as we know them today, developed from\r\n                earlier species
  of animals\" and \"according to astronomers,\r\n                the universe began
  with a big explosion\"). Respondents were\r\n                much more likely to
  answer correctly if the question was framed\r\n                as about scientific
  theories or beliefs rather than as about\r\n                the natural world. When
  the question about evolution was prefaced\r\n                by \"according to\r\n
  \               the theory of evolution,\" 74% marked true; only 44% marked\r\n
  \               true when it was not. Similarly, 62% agreed with the prefaced\r\n
  \               question about the big bang, but only 35% agreed when the prefatory\r\n
  \               phrase was omitted. These differences probably indicate that\r\n
  \               many Americans hold religious beliefs that cause them to be skeptical\r\n
  \               of established scientific ideas, even when they have some basic\r\n
  \           familiarity with those ideas.Surveys conducted by the Gallup\r\n                Organization
  provide similar evidence. An ongoing Gallup survey,\r\n                conducted
  most recently in 2004, found that only about a third\r\n                of Americans
  agreed that Darwin's theory of evolution has been\r\n                well supported
  by evidence (Newport\r\n                2004).[21] The same percentage\r\n                agreed
  with the alternative statement that Darwin's theory was\r\n                not supported
  by the evidence, and an additional 29% said they\r\n                didn't know
  enough to say. Data from 2001 were similar. Those\r\n                agreeing with
  the first statement were more likely than others\r\n                to be men, well
  educated (65% of those with postgraduate education\r\n                and 52% of
  those with a bachelor's degree), and live in the West\r\n            (47%) or East
  (42%).In response to another group of questions\r\n            on evolution asked
  by Gallup in 2004, about half (51%) of those surveyed\r\n            agreed with
  either of two statements compatible with evolution: that\r\n              human
  beings developed over millions of years either with or\r\n              without
  God's guidance in the process. However, 45% agreed with\r\n              a third
  statement, that \"God created human beings pretty much\r\n              in their
  present form at one time within the last 10,000 years\r\n              or so.\"
  These\r\n                views on the origin of human beings have remained virtually
  unchanged\r\n                (in six surveys) since the questions were first asked
  in 1982\r\n            (Newport 2004).During most of the 20th century, probably
  the most\r\n              contentious issue related to the teaching of science has
  been whether\r\n              and how evolution is to be taught in U.S. public school
  classrooms.[22],\r\n              [23] The\r\n              controversy has continued
  in the new millennium, erupting in quite\r\n              a few states, including
  Georgia and Pennsylvania, and making front-page\r\n              headlines in major
  newspapers.[24]            A survey conducted in 2005 revealed that Americans have
  been paying\r\n            fairly close attention to newspaper and television news
  coverage\r\n            about teaching alternatives to evolution (Nisbet\r\n              and
  Nisbet 2005). Contention about this issue\r\n          also surfaced in England
  in 2001 and in the Netherlands in 2005.\r\n          (See sidebar, \"More Than a
  Century After Darwin, Evolution\r\n            Still Under Attack in Science Classrooms\")Top
  of page NSF has used three survey items to assess \"public understanding\r\n                of
  the nature of scientific inquiry,\" i.e., how well people\r\n                understand
  aspects of the scientific process. Understanding how\r\n                science
  works is a major indicator of scientific literacy. Based\r\n                on their
  responses to the three inquiry items, many Americans\r\n                appear not
  to have a firm grasp of the nature of the scientific\r\n            process. The
  same is true of Europeans.In 2001, both the NSF\r\n            survey and the Eurobarometer
  asked respondents questions designed\r\n            to test their knowledge of two
  important aspects of scientific\r\n            literacy: how an experiment is conducted
  and their understanding\r\n            of probability.[25] Only\r\n            43%
  of Americans and 37% of Europeans answered the experiment question\r\n            correctly.
  Both groups did better with probability: 57% of Americans\r\n            and 69%
  of Europeans answered that question correctly. In 2004, 46%\r\n            of Americans
  answered the experiment question correctly, and 64%\r\n            gave a correct
  answer to the probability questions (appendix\r\n            table 7-13 ).\r\n            NSF
  survey respondents were also asked to explain in their own words\r\n            what
  it means to study something scientifically. In 2004, only 23%\r\n            of
  respondents gave a response that indicated they knew what it meant.[26]Although\r\n
  \           39% of Americans surveyed in 2004 correctly answered all three questions\r\n
  \           about the nature of scientific inquiry, 61% did not.[27] This lack\r\n
  \           of understanding may explain why a substantial portion of the population\r\n
  \           believes in various forms of pseudoscience. Top of page Although S&T
  are held in high esteem throughout the modern\r\n                world, pseudoscientific
  beliefs continue to thrive. Such beliefs\r\n                coexist alongside society's
  professed respect for science and\r\n            the scientific process.A recent
  study of 20 years of survey data\r\n            collected by NSF concluded that
  \"many Americans accept pseudoscientific\r\n            beliefs,\" such\r\n                as
  astrology, lucky numbers, the existence of unidentified flying\r\n                objects
  (UFOs), extrasensory perception (ESP), and magnetic therapy\r\n                (Losh
  et al. 2003). Such beliefs indicate a lack of understanding\r\n                of
  how science works and how evidence is investigated and subsequently\r\n                determined
  to be either valid or not. Scientists, educators,\r\n            and others are
  concerned that people have not acquired the critical\r\n                thinking
  skills they need to distinguish fact from fiction. The\r\n                science
  community and those whose job it is to communicate information\r\n                about
  science to the public have been particularly concerned\r\n            about the
  public's susceptibility to unproven claims that could adversely\r\n                affect
  their health, safety, and pocketbooks (NIST 2002). (See\r\n            sidebar,
  \"Sense About Science.\")Pseudoscience has been\r\n                defined as \"claims
  presented so that\r\n                they appear [to be] scientific even though
  they lack supporting\r\n                evidence and plausibility\" (Shermer\r\n
  \               1997, p. 33).[28] In contrast,\r\n                science is \"a
  set of methods designed to describe and interpret\r\n                observed and
  inferred phenomena, past or present, and aimed at\r\n                building a
  testable body of knowledge open to rejection or confirmation\" (Shermer\r\n            1997,
  p. 17).Belief in pseudoscience increased significantly\r\n                during
  the 1990s and into the early part of this decade (Newport\r\n                and
  Strausberg 2001) and then fell somewhat between 2001\r\n                and 2005
  (figure 7-8 ).\r\n                The largest declines were in the number of people
  who believe\r\n                in ESP, clairvoyance, ghosts, mentally communicating
  with the\r\n                dead, and channeling.  Nevertheless, about three-fourths\r\n
  \               of Americans hold at least one pseudoscientific belief; i.e.,\r\n
  \               they believed in at least 1 of the 10 survey items (similar to\r\n
  \               the percentage recorded in 2001).[29]            In addition, 22%
  believed in five or more of the items, 32% believed\r\n            in four, and
  57% believed in two. However, only 1% believed in\r\n            all 10 (Moore 2005b).Belief\r\n
  \               in pseudoscience is widespread. For example, at least a quarter\r\n
  \               of the U.S. population believes in astrology, i.e., that the\r\n
  \               position of the stars and planets can affect people's lives.\r\n
  \               Although two-thirds (66%) of those queried in 2004 said that\r\n
  \               astrology is \"not at all scientific,\" about one-third\r\n                considered
  it at least \"sort of scientific\" (appendix\r\n            table 7-14 ).[30]Belief
  in astrology may be more prevalent in Europe.\r\n                In 2001, 53% of
  Europeans surveyed thought astrology is \"rather\r\n                scientific\"
  and\r\n                only a minority (39%) said it is not at all scientific. In
  the\r\n                2005 survey, Europeans were asked whether or not they considered\r\n
  \               certain subjects to be scientific, using a 5-point scale (with\r\n
  \               higher values indicating that a subject is more scientific).\r\n
  \               About 4 out of 10 (41%) of those surveyed gave responses of 4\r\n
  \               or 5 for astrology, the same as the score for economics. However,\r\n
  \               when the survey used the word \"horoscopes\" instead\r\n                of
  astrology, only 13% gave a response of 4 or 5. Disciplines\r\n                most
  likely to be considered scientific by Europeans were medicine\r\n                (89%),
  physics (83%), biology (75%), mathematics (72%), astronomy\r\n                (70%),
  and psychology (53%). History (34%) and homeopathy (33%)\r\n                were
  at the bottom of the list (European Commission 2005a). Comparable\r\n            U.S.
  data on the various disciplines do not exist.Europeans\r\n                were more
  likely than Americans to agree that \"some\r\n                numbers are particularly
  lucky for some people.\" The percentages\r\n            in Europe were 37% (2005)
  and 32% (2001).[31]In the United States,\r\n                skepticism about astrology
  is strongly related to level of education:\r\n                in 2004, 81% of college
  graduates said that astrology is \"not\r\n                at all scientific,\" compared
  with 51%\r\n                of those with less than a high school education and
  62% of those\r\n                who had completed high school but not college. In
  Europe, however,\r\n                respondents with college degrees were just as
  likely as others\r\n            to claim that astrology is scientific.In the United
  States, belief\r\n                in astrology is also related to level of income
  (which, in turn,\r\n                is related to education). Those in higher income
  brackets were\r\n                less likely than others to say that astrology is
  either very\r\n            or sort of scientific.Like astrology in the United States
  and\r\n            Europe, fortune telling is common in China and South Korea. However,\r\n
  \           only 1% of Chinese survey respondents said fortune telling is very\r\n
  \           scientific and 10% thought it is \"a bit\" scientific. In\r\n            contrast,
  74% answered either \"not at all scientific\" or \"not\r\n                very scientific.\"
  A similar item on a South Korean survey\r\n                showed a larger percentage
  (37%) of respondents answering either \"very\r\n                scientific\" or
  \"sort of scientific\" (figure 7-9 ;\r\n                appendix table 7-15 ).Surveys
  conducted by NSF and other organizations suggest that at\r\n            least half
  of the U.S. public believes in the existence of ESP (CBS\r\n            News 2002),
  and a sizable minority believes in UFOs and that aliens\r\n            have landed
  on Earth. In the 2001 NSF survey, 60% of respondents\r\n            agreed that
  \  \"some people possess psychic powers or ESP,\" and\r\n                  30% agreed
  that \"some of the unidentified flying objects that\r\n                  have been
  reported are really space vehicles from other civilizations.\" Similarly,\r\n                  one-third
  of the Chinese respondents (33%) believed in the existence\r\n          of aliens.Top
  of page In 1999, the Kansas State Board of Education decided to delete evolution\r\n
  \           from the state's science standards. The action received widespread\r\n
  \           press coverage and sparked an outcry in the science community. Most\r\n
  \           of the public also disagreed with the decision, which was reversed\r\n
  \           after board members who had voted for the change were defeated in\r\n
  \         the next election.Thus began another round of attacks on the teaching\r\n
  \ of evolution in public school classrooms. Similar eruptions have been occurring\r\n
  \ since the landmark 1925 Scopes \"monkey\" trial. Although\r\n  Tennessee teacher
  John Scopes was convicted, science ended up being\r\n  the true victor, according
  to the history books and thanks to the\r\n  play Inherit the Wind. The next milestone
  occurred in 1987 when the\r\n  Supreme Court struck down a Louisiana law that prohibited
  the teaching\r\n  of evolution unless equal time was given to creationism.The National
  Center\r\n  for Science Education (NCSE) tracks attacks on the teaching of evolution
  in\r\n  the United States and around the world. In general, the recent controversies\r\n
  \ have come from two directions: a push to introduce \"intelligent design\" in\r\n
  \ science classrooms as a viable alternative to evolution[*] and efforts to add\r\n
  \ evolution disclaimers to science textbooks. Recently, legislatures or school\r\n
  \ boards in about 20 states have considered allowing the teaching of\r\n  alternatives
  to evolution in science classrooms. Controversies making\r\n  national headlines
  include the following:In addition to the way science is taught (or\r\n  not taught)
  in classrooms,[†] battles\r\n  over other issues have erupted in other places in
  recent years:This kind of controversy is almost absent in other industrialized\r\n
  \     nations. However, that may be changing. For example, since 2002,\r\n      the
  teaching of creationism at a small group of privately financed\r\n      state schools
  in northeast England has triggered a considerable amount\r\n      of debate in Parliament
  (Pincock 2005).[*] The theory of intelligent design\r\n      holds that life is
  too complex to have happened by chance and that, therefore,\r\n      some sort of
  intelligent designer must be responsible. Critics claim that\r\n      this theory
  is simply a more sophisticated form of creationism (which the\r\n      courts have
  said may not be taught in public schools). They argue that\r\n      intelligent
  design theory has nothing to do with science because its assertions\r\n      are
  not falsiable: they cannot be tested or observed and cannot undergo\r\n      experimentation.
  In contrast, \"[evolution] has been directly\r\n      observed in operation not
  only in the laboratory but also in the\r\n      field. Where there is still room
  for argument and discussion is in\r\n      the precise contributions of different
  mechanisms to evolutionary\r\n      change. In this vibrant debate, intelligent
  design offers no meaningful\r\n      contribution.\" According to Eugenie C. Scott,
  president of the\r\n      National Center for Science Education, \"There aren't
  any alternative\r\n      scientic theories to evolution.\" In October 2002, the
  American\r\n      Association for the Advancement of Science Board of Directors
  passed\r\n      a resolution on intelligent design that \"calls upon its members\r\n
  \     to assist those engaged in overseeing science education policy to\r\n      understand
  the nature of science, the content of contemporary evolutionary\r\n      theory
  and the inappropriateness of 'intelligent design theory' as\r\n      a subject matter
  for science education.\"[†] Although they are using teaching guides and textbooks
  that meet the\r\n      approval of biologists, some teachers avoid mentioning evolution
  in their\r\n      classrooms because their superintendents or principals discourage
  them\r\n      from discussing it or because of opposition in the communities in
  which they\r\n      teach. This approach can take the form of assigning the material
  on evolution\r\n      to be read, but not discussing it in class (Dean\r\n      2005)Top
  of page A new group, Sense About Science, was recently formed in the United\r\n
  \             Kingdom. Its goal is to help scientists and their institutions\r\n
  \             educate the press and the public about the importance of peer review.\r\n
  \             Recent scares-such as the possibility that radiation from mobile\r\n
  \             phones poses health risks, that the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella)\r\n
  \             vaccine can cause autism, and that acrylamide in fried foods can\r\n
  \             cause cancer-could be put into perspective if the press and the\r\n
  \             public understood how the scientific process is used to distinguish\r\n
  \             between claims that are valid and those that are not. A poll commissioned\r\n
  \             in 2004 by the Science Media Centre and the journal Nature and\r\n
  \             conducted by the London-based market-research company MORI revealed\r\n
  \             that almost three-fourths of the UK public does not know what peer\r\n
  \             review is. Sense About Science plans to work with research and\r\n
  \             educational bodies to encourage teaching about peer review in schools\r\n
  \             and universities (Sense About Science 2004).Top of page [17] Researchers
  have concluded\r\n              that fewer than one-fifth of Americans meet a minimal
  standard\r\n            of civic scientific literacy (Miller, Pardo, and Niwa 1997).[18]
  \             In Europe, residents of Sweden, the Czech Republic, Finland, the\r\n
  \             Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, and Slovenia have the highest rates\r\n
  \           of scientific knowledge, and Portugal, Malta, Latvia, Bulgaria, Cyprus\r\n
  \           and Turkey the lowest. Also, in Europe, men, persons between the\r\n
  \           ages of 15 and 54, those with more years of formal schooling, and\r\n
  \           those who do not attend religious services are more likely than others\r\n
  \           to provide correct responses to questions designed to test their\r\n
  \           knowledge of science (European Commission\r\n            2005a).  [19]
  In China, only 1.4% of the population\r\n              possessed basic scientific
  literacy in 2001. The percentage was\r\n              higher among men (1.7%) and
  urban residents (3.1%) (Chinese\r\n              Ministry of Science and Technology
  2002).[20] In its own international comparison\r\n              of scientific literacy,
  Japan ranked itself 10th of 14 countries\r\n              included in the report
  (National Institute\r\n              of Science and Technology Policy 2002).[21]
  A recent analysis of public\r\n              opinion concerning evolution suggests
  that \"many members of\r\n              the public underestimate the scientific
  evidence in support of\r\n              evolution and overestimate the evidence
  supporting intelligent\r\n              design\" (Nisbet and Nisbet\r\n            2005).[22]
  The cover of the November 2004\r\n              issue of National Geographic Magazine
  asked \"Was Darwin Wrong?\" The\r\n              33-page article concluded that
  \"[t]he evidence for evolution\r\n              is overwhelming.\"[23]              The
  National Science Board issued a statement on the subject in\r\n            August
  1999 (National Science Board 1999). [24] In a 2005 CBS/New\r\n              York
  Times poll, 57% of those surveyed favored teaching creationism\r\n              along
  with evolution in public schools, down from 65% 4 months\r\n              earlier.
  In the same 2005 poll, 35% favored teaching creationism\r\n              instead
  of evolution in public schools, down from 37% in the previous\r\n              survey.
  About half of those surveyed in both 2004 and 2005 opposed\r\n            teaching
  creationism instead of evolution. [25] The\r\n              question pertaining
  to experimental evaluation was: \"Now,\r\n            please think of this situation.
  Two scientists want to know if a\r\n            certain drug is effective in treating
  high blood pressure. The first\r\n            scientist wants to give the drug to
  1,000 people with high blood\r\n            pressure and see how many experience
  lower blood pressure levels.\r\n            The second scientist wants to give the
  drug to 500 people with high\r\n            blood pressure, and not give the drug
  to another 500 people with\r\n            high blood pressure, and see how many
  in both groups experience lower\r\n            blood pressure levels. Which is the
  better way to test this drug?\r\n            Why is it better to test the drug this
  way?\"The text of the\r\n            probability question in 2004 was: \"Now think\r\n
  \           about this situation. A doctor tells a couple that their 'genetic\r\n
  \           makeup' means that they've got one in four chances of having a child\r\n
  \           with an inherited illness. Does this mean that if their first child\r\n
  \           has the illness, the next three will not? Does this mean that each\r\n
  \           of the couple's children will have the same risk of suffering from\r\n
  \           the illness?\"[26] Correct explanations of scientific\r\n              study
  include responses describing it as theory testing, experimentation,\r\n              or
  rigorous, systematic comparison.[27] Similar to questions about scientific\r\n              facts
  and concepts, younger respondents, those with more formal\r\n              education
  and higher incomes, and those without minor children\r\n              at home were
  more likely than others to give correct responses\r\n              to questions
  about the scientific process (appendix\r\n              table 7-13).[28]              According
  to one group studying such phenomena, pseudoscientific\r\n            topics include
  yogi flying, therapeutic touch, astrology, fire walking,\r\n            voodoo magical
  thinking, alternative medicine, channeling, Carlos\r\n            hoax, psychic
  hotlines and detectives, near-death experiences, unidentified\r\n            flying
  objects and alien abductions, the Bermuda Triangle, homeopathy,\r\n            faith
  healing, and reincarnation (Committee\r\n            for the Scientific Investigation
  of Claims of the Paranormal 2003).[29] Those 10 items were extrasensory\r\n              perception
  (ESP), that houses can be haunted, ghosts/that spirits\r\n              of dead
  people can come back in certain places/situations, telepathy/communication\r\n              between
  minds without using traditional senses, clairvoyance/the\r\n              power
  of the mind to know the past and predict the future, astrology/that\r\n              the
  position of the stars and planets can affect people's lives,\r\n              that
  people can communicate mentally with someone who has died,\r\n              witches,
  reincarnation/the rebirth of the soul in a new body after\r\n              death,
  and channeling/allowing a \"spirit-being\" to temporarily\r\n            assume
  control of a body.[30] In the 2001 NSF survey, 56%\r\n              of those surveyed
  agreed that astrology is \"not at all scientific,\" 9%\r\n              said it
  is \"very scientific,\" and\r\n            31% thought it \"sort of scientific.\"
  The difference between\r\n            the 2001 and 2004 data may be attributable
  to differences in questionnaire\r\n            design in the 2 years. [31] Countries
  with the highest levels\r\n              of agreement were Italy, Latvia, the Czech
  Republic, Ireland, and\r\n              Austria. The \"least\r\n            convinced\"
  were\r\n            in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Finland (European\r\n            Commission
