  There are a lot of great options for cash back credit cards right now, offering very compelling cash back rates and lucrative intro bonuses. But the one card that comes out on top in our analysis of the average person’s spending pattern is the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express (a NextAdvisor advertiser).Â  Its 6% cash back rate on groceries is the highest we’ve found from any card in any category and its 3% back on gas and department stores is the highest year-round rate in those categories. To top it off, its $150 intro bonus is the highest of any cash back card we’ve reviewed. We decided to dive deeper into its potential earnings, benefits and detriments to see if it is a smart choice for you. In short, if you have excellent credit and fairly typical spending patterns, it’s probably your best choice. In fact, it’s so great that I have one and use it frequently, enjoying generous cash back rewards. You can learn more about Blue Cash Preferred in our detailed analysis below.
- |
  The Highlights
- |
  If you enjoy earning phenomenal cash back rewards, you’ll love this card. The Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express combines terrific cash back with a 0% intro APR and great American Express benefits. It starts off with a $150 bonus after you spend $1,000 in the first 3 months. If you use your card like a typical consumer, it should be pretty easy to meet these requirements. You can even pay for your mortgage and your utilities with the card (if these entities accept credit cards – most do) to help accrue the initial $1,000 and earn you additional cash back over time.
- |
  You’ll also earn a whopping 6% cash back at US supermarkets on your first $6K in grocery purchases each year, after that you earn 1% back. If you do a lot of food shopping, this is a huge bonus and a great way to earn extra cash as the 6% can add up to substantial cash back. You can even think of it as an effective 6% discount on your groceries when you pay with this card – a pretty great ‘coupon’!
- |
  In addition you’ll earn an unlimited 3% back at US gas stations and 3% back at select department stores like Sears, Macys, Kohl’s, Nordstrom, JC Penney and many more. The 3% back on gas can take a little of the sting out of filling up your tank, and if you shop at the select department stores the extra 3% back can make your purchase that much more enjoyable. Note that there is no limit on the amount of cash back you can earn at this 3% rate so if you’re a big spender on either gas or department stores, this card is likely a no-brainer. The rest of your card purchases will earn a very decent 1% cash back. You can redeem your earned cash back for a statement credit, gift card (including AmEx gift cards) or items in their online shopping mall.
- |
  Along with great cash back rewards, Blue Cash PreferredÂ cardholders pay no interest for the first 15 months on both purchases and balance transfers. This 0% APR period will take you into 2017 interest-free, and can help you pay down any card purchases or balance transfers without owing interest fees.
- |
  World travelers will enjoy that Blue Cash Preferred featuresÂ chip-enabled technology, making it easier to pay for purchases outside the U.S. Â International merchants, particularly in Europe, are starting to require this technology in order to accept your credit card for payment.
- |
  Having an American Express card also means you get great benefits like extended warranties on eligible purchases, purchase protection and return protection. And vacations can be easier with car rental loss/damage insurance, travel accident insurance and their roadside assistance hotline. Plus you get exclusive access to ticket presales and card member-only events.
- |
  Things To Consider
- |
  Blue Cash Preferred does charge a $75 annual fee, which may seem like a lot but is typically something you can more than make up for through the cash back rewards you’ll accrue over the course of the year. If this is something you’re not willing to compromise on, its highly-rated sister card might be more up your alley. TheÂ Blue Cash Everyday Card from American ExpressÂ doesn’t charge any annual fees, features a 15-month 0% APR, and you’ll earn 3% back at US supermarkets, 2% back as gas stations and select department stores and 1% back on everything else.
- |
  Although earning 6% on groceries and 3% at gas stations and department stores is pretty great, if you don’t typically spend much at these places then you are probably better off with a card that offers a higher flat rate back on all purchases. Our favorite in this category is the Citi Double Cash Card. It features an effective 2% cash back on all purchases as well as no annual fee and the ability to get your rewards via check or direct deposit. You should also be aware that purchases at warehouses and superstores aren’t eligible for the 6% cash back with Blue Cash Preferred. Instead you’ll earn the standard 1% cash back, which is still pretty darn good as many cards won’t give you any cash back at all for shopping at places likeÂ Costco, Target and Walmart. Superstores and warehouses also aren’t eligible for the 3% back on gas, you’ll get 1% back there too. If you’re not sure about how this might affect you, use our free Cash Back Card Calculator to estimate how much you might earn with each of the different cash back cards given your spending patterns.
- |
  If you enjoy traveling outside the U.S., be aware that Blue Cash Preferred charges a 2.7% foreign transaction fee. This charge can add up over time, particularly if you’re making all your international purchases on the card. If this isn’t something you’re willing to consider take a look at the Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards card, which doesn’t charge any foreign transaction fees and offers 1.5% cash back on all purchases.
- |
  The cash back rewards for Blue Cash Preferred are very generous, but you aren’t able to receive a check or direct deposit to your bank account with the money from your rewards. Instead you need toÂ redeem your rewards for a statement credit on your account, or for gifts cards and other merchandise. While a statement credit is just the same as cash to most people, if you prefer to get cash in your hand, check out the aforementioned Citi Double Cash Card, which offers the ability to get your rewards via check or direct deposit.
- |
  Finally, you do need to have excellent credit (often considered to be a credit score above 720 but sometimes considered a score over 750) to be approved for Blue Cash Preferred. If your credit is not quite at that level, you should consider one of these cards for less-than-perfect credit.
- |
  Should You Apply For Blue Cash Preferred from American Express?
- |
  Blue Cash Preferred is a terrific card for anyone with excellent credit who wants to get big cash back rewards on groceries, gas and purchases at select department stores. In fact, the 6% back at supermarkets is the highest rate we’ve seen offered to consumers in any category. Plus, you can take advantage of the 15-month 0% APR on balance transfers and purchases. It does have an annual fee, and if you shop at superstores and warehouse stores you’ll earn the standard 1% instead of the higher cash back rates. You also can’t get your rewards in the form of a check or direct deposit and it does charge foreign transaction fees. If these are significant factors to you, consider some of the options detailed above. Overall though, Blue Cash Preferred is our #1 rated cash back card and a great choice for a strong cash back card.

        Cards with variable rebates, such as the AMEX blue card, are gimmicks and should not be considered seriously by most.  Annual fees add to the disincentive.  Sticke with the few cards offering 1 1/2 % and in some cases 2% on almost all purchases without fees or limits. 1% airline mile cards are no better.  The Fidelity Investments card, available as AMEX or Mastercard, through FIA Card Services, is one such card at 2%.

        When it is 6% on groceries and 3% on gas… can you buy items at Kroger for 6% cash back, and then turn around and buy Kroger gas (because that gives you a discount at the pump) at 3% cash back? Or can that apply to gift cards bought at Kroger (which grants 4x reward points)?
- |
  If all of that falls in line, for every $25 you spend at Kroger, you get 6% back, ($1.50) then you get 10 cents off on your gas price, with 10 gallons ($1) and 3% back on that…
- |
  Spend $100 at Kroger (6% back is $6), get $1.00 off per gallon of gas. Ten gallons at $2.80 goes down to $1.80 (saves $10), spending $18 upon which you get 3% back, ($0.54) … you’re saving  $16.54. Do that consistently on average for a year and you save  just under $200. That excludes using the $100 gift card purchase being used for additional 6% or 3% cash back on using it.

        I have an American Express credit card. I have it because it is very generous in providing cash back. However, I do not use it for many purchases because of the problems discussed prior to this entry. I was offered a Blue Cash card and declined it. I do not wish to pay a credit card that requires me to pay a fee for using it. Amex has some good cash back features BUT make sure you pay your balance every month when due.

        ANY CREDIT CARD is only good for keeping a record of your spending, and the coinvience of NOT CARRYING CASH. And THE ONLY WAY that you can come out “ON TOP”, is IF you PAY YOUR TOTAL BALANCE OFF at the end of each month WNEN BILLED. IF you don’t pay your total balance at the end of each month, the PERCENTAGE OF PENALITY  YOU WILL BE LIABLE FOR WILL “EAT YOU ALIVE”, and CONTINUE TO EAT YOU ALIVE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING MONTHS UNTIL YOU HAVE PAID OFF YOUR BALANCE INTO THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH. YOU MUST KNOW THIS, AND IF YOU CANNOT PAY OFF YOUR BALANCE “IN FULL” AT THE END OF EACH MONTH, THEN YOU SHOULD “RUN FROM OWNING ANY CREDIT CARDS!!!!!!

        The rebate ceiling on AMEX Preferred Blue detracts from its appeal because the hefty fee targets the big spenders.  The Fidelity Amex is my go-to card for rewards, but Discover’s it Card comes in second.  Discover nominally offers an unlimited 1% rebate, but its merchant offers make it easy to get 5%, 10% or much more.  In addition, Discover will double your cumulatively  earned rebates over the initial 12 months.  One last point: Discover has, by far, the best service of any card; telephone reps are well trained, articulate, courteous and all located within the U.S.

        You would have to spend $1250 at a true grocery store (Kroger, Safeway, Albertsons) just for the 6% cash back to cover the $75 annual fee, or $2500 at stand-alone gas stations (not discount stations like Wal-Mart or Costco). Still, many grocery stores offer lower prices than the big discount chains on food so you can save money. Just be careful to “fence off” the money you would have spent out of your checking account or paycheck so you can pay the credit card bill when it arrives next month.

        I got this card for my day to day use and found it to be very disappointing.  I’m not getting much back, their website is annoying, getting the rewards is a special exception, and I never got any $150 bonus., also many places don’t take AMEX.  I think this card is just good for them.

        I was really excited about this card since I am not a traveler and was looking for a deal on gas and groceries.  I did not know about the grocery limitation until just last week.  I do shop for groceries at Walmart more and more.  So those purchases make having this card worthless.  It is also worth noting that there are restrictions on gas stations as well. Only “stand alone” stations qualify.  I called today to get a listing of the gas stations and the person with whom I spoke was not clear.  I do not think Von’s or Costco type places qualify.  So you have to pay higher prices at name brand gas stations to save.  Go figure.

        One problem that I haven’t seen discussed is that you only get the 6% rebate from “true” grocery stores/chains.  However, since I buy most of our groceries at Walmart, I wouldn’t get back the promised 6% on grocery purchases.  That’s because most credit cards use a code to designate the primary business that is transacted at each store that accepts its credit cards.  I have no idea what Walmart’s primary business code is, but I’d be surprised if it is groceries.  Therefore, instead of getting back 6% on groceries bought at Walmart, as your article espouses, you may get back only 1%, unless you buy them from a recognized grocery store/chain.  Makes the $75 annual fee a waste of money compared to Citibank’s newer Double Cash card which returns 2% on everything, and has no annual fee.

        As the former owner of a Car Stereo Shop I only put on a sale twice a year. My customers knew that when that time came then it was legitimate. I generally held one near Back to school and then at the end of January. Back to school to get the teens in to buy and end of January till the end of February to lure the Tax refund money as well as to clear out old inventory. Small businesses is where you will find “true sales”. Get to know a local shop. As for Credit Cards? I took them and added a 6 percent fee. Yes, you the customer pays for all transaction fees. So all these cards do is pay you back for what you paid us. I would not take Amex at all. Trans fees for merchants makes it not worth taking at all. Same with Discover cards.

        It is sad to see so many people falling for this scam.
- |
  You are the loser no matter how you add it , divide it or multiply it by two. (its a saying)
- |
  Merchants add the cost they have to pay to the credit card companies for you and me to swipe our debit or credit cards.
- |
  So we are really getting pennies for the dollars we lose every year by allowing the industry to move us from cash to credit and debit…because the only winner is the credit card companies…its a genius idea and we are sucking it up.
- |
  Wish I had the time to give you detailed explanation of how it all works…but my advice is stop spending…nothing is on special and nothing is half off….its all junk that is over priced and to get you to buy it…you need to see the red sticker that fools your brain…because this is how you have been trained since being a kid.

  I never though that I would buy into a credit card with a fee. However, this is by far the best credit card I ever had. I use this card with the no fee Amazon Visa (3% on Amazon purchases, 2% at restaurants and pharmacies, 1% everything else.)

        Fidelity Amex  gives you 2% on all purchases with no limit.  We do that for all we can charge and it usually allows us to buy a ticket to go wherever we want with no airline hassel. THERE IS NO ANNUAL CHARGE just have a Fidelity account.

        Ray, the first post here and guy without a PHD must be wrong on his calculations. Spending $15,000 annually there is NO WAY he can accumulate more than $3000 in cashback. That would be over 20%. He must have pushed the wrong buttons on his calculator or forgot to use the right decimal. Maybe $300, but no way $3,000.

        If you look at it that you get 3% off groc. with the free card it would take longer to recoup your $75 annual fee.  I do use the free Am Ex for all the groc. I can but my go-to store is Aldi’s for  the best price.  Aldi’s does not take any charge cards – just debit/cash etc.
- |
  I have the Sam’s card too for the 5% back on gas and 3% on travel.  I have 2 cards with the rotating catagories – Chase Freedom and Discover It. so the quarter they are giving 5% back in a catagory I use that particular card.  I like the restaurant 5% quarters and Home Improvement stores 5%.  Currently Discover is offering 5% back for amazon.com, clothing and dept. stores which is good for the Christmas buying season.  I just don’t like the idea of paying $75 to have any card when the others are all free.  I also use a AARP Chase card for restaurants which is 3% off if there is no better deal @ Discover or Chase Freedom.  I love the free reward $ and/or gift cards.

        I absolutely love this card. When you add the benefits and rewards you get, the card pays for itself. I started off with the no annual fee cash card from AMEX & soon upgraded to the AMEX preferred when I realized just how much more my rewards would be with this card. I spend over $500. monthly on groceries, even more holiday months and so the rewards have really added. Like to use the card for gas too. Right now I have over $450. in cash rewards which I will use to purchase gift cards this Xmas season. I highly recommend this card . My only advise is to do as I do, pay your bill off monthly so that it is interest free and the only one earning is you. Love my card!

        I buy most of my groceries at Costco where most items are already discounted more that the 6%.  After April you’ll need a Citibank Visa card there which will provide a 1 or 2% additional rebate, depending on your membership status.  They’ll also match the current 3% rebate at all gas stations.  This one doesn’t sound like the one for me.  Look into the Am ex solid blue card with no annual fee as a good partner to the new Costco Visa.

        You must spend $1250 on groceries or $2500 on gas (75/.06 and 75/.03)  just to break even with the $75 annual fee. $1875 and $7500 before you break even on a regular 2% back on everything card.

        I have had this card for 3 years and it is great.  Like with every other card, it gets paid off every month, so there is no interest charges.  And between me and my roommate, we easily spend right at $500 per month at the grocery store and then gas, with the strict rule, those are the only two places the card goes.  It’s like getting a 6% discount on our grocery bill.  Can’t beat it! I haven’t tried it yet, but if you throw some coupons on top of that, you could save some serious cash.

        If Walmart and BJ’s and Sam’s Club stores are not considered grocery stores it could be an issue with the Amex card. But if you spend $5000 at a regular grocery store a year around $400 a month it would still be $300 of the Amex Card rebate. Figure in $1500 for gasoline and that is another  $45 rebate. Still seems worthwhile almost like free money.

        I have this card – thought what a great deal as much groceries that I buy.  Doesn’t count as groceries at Wal-Mart or any grocery store that sells merchandise too.  Still get 1%, but not 3% or 6%.  For the most part I have only been getting 1% for everywhere that I shop  around my area.

        I use this card only at grocery stores until I hit $6,000. That’s $360. I’ll take $285 after the fee! I use my Cap One Venture card for everything else (and grocery stores after my $6,000 limit) to get 2% on all of that. You CAN use it at Kroger for the 6% cash back, so I use it to buy gift cards there for other stores. That gives me both double fuel points and the 6% cash back.

  As far as keeping track of spending, the online system automatically does that for you when you sign in to your account. I see no reason why you wouldn’t want this card, especially if you are buying groceries (and gift cards) for 2 or more people throughout the year. A single person who doesn’t do much grocery shopping likely wouldn’t benefit much, but for the right situation it’s perfect!

        Over the last 24 months I spent $4000 for groceries, $400 for gas, and $22,600 for other using my Discover card.  This Amex card would have given me a total reward of $586 at a cost of $150.  The net reward — with the strict limits on what it could be used for — would have been equal to 1.6%.  But a while back I switched to Cap One and get 1.5% on everything.  Amex may be a useful card for some people, but it’s not accepted in lots of places, so why should I switch for 0.1% and still have to use a different card much of the time.

        Be sure you understand what American Express calls a grocery store. They only give you 1% back at the grocery stores where most of us shop, like Walmart,  Kroger, and Meijers. When I called American express to ask why I only received 1% instead of 3% at Meijers, Kroger etc. they told me those stores are not true grocery stores. I cancelled my card.

        6% of $6000 is $360. I get much more on the old Blue Cash which gives an unlimited 5% on groceries after spending a total of $6500 on the card. The $6500 spend is equivalent to a annual fee because of the forgone cash back and is therefore similar to the $65 fee for the Blue Cash Preferred.
- |
  In my opinion the Blue Cash Preferred represents an attempt to reduce benefits without appearing to do so. Citi Double and Capital One are much better deals.

        This might be OK if you don’t mind keeping careful track of what you are spending and when.  My Capital One Venture card, though gives a straight 2% back on everything no matter what you spend the money on.  The only caveat is that they do it in points, and you have to go online and apply the points to remove the charges on the card.  It’s easiest for travel expenses, but since I spend more than 2% of my purchases on the card on travel-related things, erasing them is easy.

        I’ve been associated with  non-profits for a couple of years.  We look very carefully at our expenses, including credit card charges.  We noticed that the charge to the non-profit varied with the card used by the customer/client.    Charges ranged from about 1% to almost 7%, depending upon the plan chosen by the cardholder.  Simple cards have the lowest charges, cash back cards have the higher charges.   Who do you think actually pays for your “cash back”??    Have you ever noticed that non-profits and candidates for election often ask for an additional 3-5% to defray their charges on accepting your credit card payment?

        FYI: You cannot pay debt with debt.  Your line about being able to pay your mortgage with credit should removed.

        I have had an American Express that I have used for years, but never see it anywhere.  No annual fee.  It only offers 1% for the first $6500 of purchases in a “12-month period beginning on your card anniversary”.  But after that, I get 5% on “Everyday purchases” (gas, groceries) and 1% on everything else.  Almost the inverse of the card mentioned in the article…  However, definitely better than the Sallie Mae MC ($250 of CHARGES a month=$12.50 a month), as I spend that much on groceries in a week.  Depending on how much I actually spend on groceries and gas, I might be better off with 2% back on everything…

        I have been using American Express for 30 years, but will cut up my card.  I do not want any trackable chip in my wallet, and Amex is forcing all card holders to accept cards with RFID chips.
- |
  If Amex gives me no choice, then my only remaining choice is to leave Amex.  The old reliable magnetic strip cards work well and cannot be hacked by someone walking near me like the chip cards can be hacked.

  Adios American Express!

        I  own and have  owned over the years several varieties of rebate credit cards.  I see and read many comments on the drawbacks of credit cards.  Like any tool, it must be used for what it was intended.  I have American Express Blue Cash and the card is accepted everywhere I have needed to use it.  The card does exactly what they claim.  The 6% on groceries is a true rebate.  The posting claiming that credit cards are evil and are not preferred is not a completely true statement.  Misuse and improper use of credit is what is bad.  I do no use checks. This is just a tragedy waiting to happen.  Unlike a credit card.  You are not protected by issue someone a check.. Your check has everything on it for someone to commit fraud and empty your bank account.  At the bottom of your check is your entire banking routing number and bank account number.  A criminal just scans your check and begins printing counterfeit checks from your account.   A credit card limits your loss to $25.00 for unauthorized purchases.  On the issue of Cash.. To buy groceries.. fill the gas tank and pay with cash would require I have hundreds and hundreds of dollar of cash in my pocket and require constant visit to ATM or bank to replenish my wallet.  The Credit card allow to purchase online and order items. I can hold/reserve a future purchase and I am able to cancel with ease.  The fact a company gives a reward for the use of the card is good business sense.  Vendors and store owners build the cost in the use of credit card.  Sure, as an owner can offer a discount for use of cash.  I find this more popular for stores who do not wish to sales tax and income tax purpose.  With this all being said.  If you can handle a credit card.  American Express Blue is fantastic and web, mobile and customer support is superb and polished.

        As some people pointed out, this card pays 6% of $6000 spent in a year AND NOT A MONTH. So the max “reward” you get is $360 – $75 (Annual fee) = $285. Remember this is in a year and NOT A  MONTH. Check out Sallie Mae Mastercard which is IN A MONTH (I too am looking for a better card and Sallie Mae MC seems far better).

        Unfortunately it’s the business that have to cover the cost of the card’s benefits.
- |
  That’s why I do not accept American Express at my business. They are way to expensive for me. Discover card’s fees are good and Visa & MasterCard fees are fair. I prefer my customers to pay with cash or check. Enticing people to use a credit card because of a “cash back” benefit is just plain deceptive.

        In 6 months time I got $350 worth of restaurant gift cards from my Discover Card. I travel  for a living and my company pays me a per diem for food, so it’s like free money, and there’s no limit on the amount of gift cards I can get. 6% of $6000 is $360. So, no thanks. Also my Discover has no annual fee.

        In 6 months time I got $350 worth of restaurant gift cards from my Discover Card. I travel  for a living and my company pays me a per diem for food, so it’s like free money, and there’s no limit on the amount of gift cards I can get. 6% of $6000 is $360. So, no thanks. Also my Discover has no annual fee.

        Talked American Express yesterday and they offered me this card with no annual fee, only 3%on groceries, 2% on gas and restaurants and 1% elsewhere. Included $200  if $1000 is charged in 90 days, BUT required my Social Security number which they already had. They’re gasping for customers as they lose Costco in a year.

        It says it does not pay 6% at club warehouse grocery stores, but what about warehouse grocery stores that do not have membership fees, such as WinCo Food and FoodMaxx stores that are membership free located here in northern California? Has anyone had experience with these grocery stores?

        Sam’s Club Mastercard is the best cash back card…if you pay off your balance monthly.  5% on gas ANYWHERE…3% on restaurants and travel…1% everywhere else…NO annual fee.  Downsides…you do have to be a club member and you can only cash out once annually and must do so at a Sam’s Club…I guess they hope you spend some of it while you’re there lol.

        For people who do mostly warehouse or discount grocery shopping,including myself, where all the credit cards I know give a max. 1% cash-back except for special promotions, I recommend the no-annual-fee American Express Blue Cash Everyday Card (3% off groceries at standalone supermarkets, 2% off gasoline at standalone stations, 1% all-else) for it’s groceries savings.  The AmEx Blue Cash Preferred Card gives you 3% more for groceries (6%) and 1% more for gasoline (3%), but you can get 3%-5% off gas with other no-annual fee cards (5% off Jan-Mar with Discover, 5% off July-Sept with Chase Freedom Visa, 3% all-year with Bank of Am. Cash Rewards Mastercard).  If you do most of your grocery shopping at standalone supermarkets, then that extra 3% cash-back for the AmEx…Preferred Card may pay for your $75 annual fee – though note the price savings you get at the warehouses and discount stores (Costco, Walmart, Aldi, etc.) is much more than that 6% vs 0-1% difference.
- |
  As I commented previously, I got this card in Nov. when I needed some auto work done and knew I’d qualify for charging $1000 in 90 days and getting a $150 cash-back reward subtracted from my statement – so I was willing to put up with the initial $75 annual fee.
- |
  I keep VERY detailed spending records – as well as seeing the cash-back totals build.  The Preferred Card’s not adding up for me because I don’t shop for enough in standalone supermarkets.
- |
  When Nov. (and my next $75-annual-fee) approaches, I’m going to switch to the no-annual fee American Express Blue Cash Everyday Card and use it primarily for the 3% off groceries. There are also occasional extra promotions worth signing up for.  Note that Chase Freedom Visa gives 5% cash-back for groceries from Jan-Mar and Bank of Am. Cash Rewards Mastercard does 2% all-year.
- |
  Note that this comment’s conclusions ignore the typical $1500/qtr. limit on extra-cash-back from various cards since I never get that high.
- |
  As you might infer from this message, I keep 5 cash-back rewards cards (besides those mentioned, I also have the Chase Amazon.com Visa: 3% off Amazon; 2% off drugstores, restaurants, stationary stores; 1% all else), using the right one at the right time to max. my cash-back rewards which were $540.43 on an avg. income and frugal spending in 2014.  If I was going to keep one, it would be a tossup between the Chase Amazon.com Visa and the Bank of Am. Cash Rewards Mastercard.

        I only average about $100-$125/month on groceries, and get 5% cash back.  My card is limited to $250/month, but I’ve never gone over that.  If I spend $1,500/year on groceries, the Blue Cash card would save me $15/year for a $75/year fee.  The same card I use for groceries also gives me 5% cash back on gas, and I also never get close to the $250/month limit.  As far as getting 3% cash back at certain department stores, I have cards with rotating 5% categories that sometimes include department stores, but when I don’t have that offer I have another card that gives 2% cash back on everything.  I don’t spend enough at department stores for that extra 1% to help me very much.  My strategy is to have a variety of cards, and for each purchase I use the credit card that gives me the most cash back.  This would be a good card to have if they didn’t charge a fee.  If they waive the fee for the first year this would get me a little extra cash back, and especially the $150 bonus, then I’d cancel before they charge the fee.

        Whoa there! Whoever was the  unnamed poster on 3/20/15 immediately (time-wise)after the  AnnaQ post on 3/19/15 – LOOK CLOSER. The supermarket 6% caps out at $6000 of spending/per year. That means that in your case you only get half of what you thought you would get at the 6% rate when spending $1000/month  for 12 months . If you calculate the rest of this credit card’s benefits they are sort of  ” blaa..,I’m going to sleep”so what.”  The  ad. “puller is the “6% on supermarkets” “Of course, they did not emphasize the cap of $6000 spending/year!!

  The rest of this offer is typical American Express – less to you for you, more profit for them….sorry if I yawn…sssss  David T

        Whoa there! Whoever was the  unnamed poster on 3/20/15 immediately (time-wise)after the  AnnaQ post on 3/19/15 – LOOK CLOSER. The supermarket 6% caps out at $6000 of spending/per year.

        Hi @Paul,
- |
  I’m sorry you believe this article was written with false intentions. I actually believe this is a great card if you spend a decent amount on groceries and gas. In fact, I believe in it so much I have the card myself and use it all the time….getting plenty of cash back each year.

        Great ad placement masquerading as news, Tasha.  Hope that AmEx takes it in the shorts  (stock, that is) for fouling up with Costco and their fat takes from merchants.

        Amex is defefinately not interested in keeping their loyal members!  They are going the way of the dineasours after this loss of Costco’s & Jet Blue to be sure. Too many other choices to be bogged down with old maketing ploy’s & highest interest rates with my excellent credit!

        This card is awesome.  I spend $1000 at the supermarket each month so I am getting $60 back each month.  You can’t beat that!  Also 3% at gas stations can’t be beaten either.  For purchases besides supermarket purchases or gas, I use a Bank of America Cash Rewards card.  They give me 2% back on everything but if you wait until you build up over $300, they will give you 2.5% cash back.  You can’t beat these 2 cards as long as you pay your bill in full each month.  Between these 2 cards, I get about $800 in cash back each year.

        Cash is not king. Not anymore. It wld be foolhardy not to take advantage of all the reward programs offered by today’s credit cards. Just keep the utilization under 30% n pay in full ea mth.  It’s that simple. Ppl who don’t obey these 2 rules are the ones who overspend, and get into financial trouble. When u have an emergency n need to use ur cards just use 30% of ea card. It’s is best to have 3-5 cards.  Ur FICO score gets dinged if u go over  30% so that’s why it necessary to have a few cards you can take some from ea in case of emergency instead of maxing out 1 or 2 cards

        The stores pay the same fee to Amex regardless of the type of card used – meaning the standard Amex card and this one cost the same to the merchant.
- |
  If you don’t carry a balance and buy groceries at a non-warehouse store its a great card.
- |
  Even the gas rebate is pretty good as a % back but as gas prices fall so does this discount. (Right now the 10 cents/gal Cumberland Farms smart pay is probably the best.
- |
  Also I know off no companies that accept mortgage payments by credit card – that would be insane for them to do unless the merchant fee is charged to the borrower (like when you pay your taxes with a credit card) you have to make your own decision if paying 2% to use a CC is worth the 1% reward (hint:it’s not)

        Amex has some serious problems on its plate right now – the loss of the Costco account and the loss of the jetBlue account soon to follow.  The sole reason I use Amex is for my frequent purchases at those two companies.  But once Costco and jetBlue make the switch to their new credit card partners, I’ll be following suit.

        It is a great marketing ploy being that they will no longer be partnered with exclusivity @ Costco next year. AX is about to lose big time. Bank of America gives 3% for gas and 2% for Supermarket and 1 % off everything else and give $100 and there is no fee for the card. Though I have one or maybe 3 of Bank of America’s Cards….. I purchase my groceries with Cash at every Supermarket and my Debit Card @ Sam’s, BJs & Costco. Why use plastic for food other than when you are at restaurant or conducting business? And don’t ever pay interest for food that has depreciated minus 0….. talk about ludicrous.

        I was considering this card; however, I foud a two small businesses in my neighborhood posted signs stating that they do not accept American Express credit cards. When I asked them why, they stated they couldn’t afford their charges.  I assume this is attributed to LoomisWeb’s comment that vendors are paying for the cash back. I would rather have a credit card that is almost unerverslly accepted without  service fee.

        You DO know that the cash back doesn’t come from American Express, don’t you? It is simply taken directly from the merchants, more often than not small, Mom and Pop stores, who are given no choice in the matter. American Express and other card companies deduct that money from the merchant and then take the credit for generously giving it back to the purchaser. Of course they also skim a healthy amount off the top as well. So the naive consumer eagerly embraces the fairy tale idea of getting “cash back” (by paying more for his purchase), instead of realizing that the merchant would much rather discount the price to the buyer directly.

        Yes, Louie and others, the supermarkets have to raise prices to pay for card fees, but since most cards do 1% cash-back at them, the AmeX 6% (Preferred $75 annual fee) and 3% (Everyday no-annual-fee) return to you more than the prices are raised.
- |
  Additionally, if the supermarkets only accepted cash as some propose, it would reduce their sales and raise prices as well.
- |
  As it is, you’re paying 6% or 3% LESS for groceries and 3%-2% less on gas and 1% less for everything else than those who advise “always pay with cash,” and you even with an avg. salary you’re getting hundreds per year in cash-back if you pay-off your entire statement every month and keep track of spending so you don’t over-spend your budget.

        I got this American Express Blue Cash Preferred card in November 2014, but only because there was a $150 bonus if I charged $1000 with it in 90 days, which was subtracted from my card balance as soon as I achieved it.  That paid for two years worth of $75 fees and gave me time to evaluate it without cost.  It’s not looking like a keeper!
- |
  It may not be worth that $75/yr compared to the similar no-annual-fee American Express Blue Cash Everyday card – and I’m considering switching over to it before my 2nd year’s $75 annual fee comes up in November 2015: as of March 9, 2015, after nearly 4 months with the card, I’ve only built up $23.61 in cash-back (not counting that $100 one-time bonus), $10.56 is due to 1% cash-back for a $1056 charge that I would have gotten the same back with any of my no-annual-fee cards.
- |
  The big deals with the Preferred card are 6% cash-back for standalone supermarkets vs 3% for the Everyday card (both do only 1% at Walmart, Costco, etc.), 3% cash-back at standalone gas stations for Preferred vs 2% for Everyday, and special permanent or time-limited online deals for Preferred like “spend $25 at  Papa Johns and get $5 cash-back.”  Both cards give at least 1% cash-back on all purchases.
- |
  Preferred may not work well if you buy most of your groceries at places like Costco, Target, Walmart and Sam’s Club – and I’ve been averaging 6.74% off with Walmart’s “Savings Catcher” combined with their no-fee Bluebird card and all my no-annual-fee cards do 1% cash-back at Walmart on top of it.  Most of the special offers aren’t bargains and apply to above-average cost stores like Whole Foods.
- |
  Two of my cards give 5% cash-back six months of the year for standalone gas stations (though you have to sign-up for the programs on your card’s webpage): Discover Card (Jan-Mar) and Chase Freedom Visa (July-Sept) so the Preferred card is basically good for me for a minority of my groceries and 6 months of gasoline.  Since I may get the Bank of America Cash Rewards Mastercard, which does 3% cash-back for gasoline, that means the Preferred’s 6% or Everyday’s 3% off for standalone supermarkets are my main reasons for using them.  The only other no-annual-fee card besides Everyday that gives more than 1% off supermarkets is that B of A Cash Rewards Mastercard which gives 2%, so Everyday would be my card of choice in supermarkets, where I do tend to shop for small amounts of things most weeks – not enough to justify the $75 annual fee to get another 3% cash-back.

        yes Louie the cash comes from money you are forced to overpay when you use the credit card.  Oddly charges are called discount points.  imagine how much the bank is charging the merchant ever time you use that card if they can still afford to give you 6% back.  Now imagine how much less ever thing would be if “nobody” used plastic and paid only cash.  Of course the government hates this because there is no way to track cash spending.

        I’m looking for no annual fee credit cards that offer additional users on the same account but with different card numbers. I pay my cards all in their entirety every month so balance transfers and low interest rates are of no interest to me.

  16, 2015There are a lot of great options for cash back credit cards right now, offering
  very compelling cash back rates and lucrative intro bonuses. But the one card that
  comes out on top in our analysis of the average person’s spending pattern is the
  Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express (a NextAdvisor advertiser).Â  Its
  6% cash back rate on groceries is the highest we’ve found from any card in any category
  and its 3% back on gas and department stores is the highest year-round rate in those
  categories. To top it off, its $150 intro bonus is the highest of any cash back
  card we’ve reviewed. We decided to dive deeper into its potential earnings, benefits
  and detriments to see if it is a smart choice for you. In short, if you have excellent
  credit and fairly typical spending patterns, it’s probably your best choice. In
  fact, it’s so great that I have one and use it frequently, enjoying generous cash
  back rewards. You can learn more about Blue Cash Preferred in our detailed analysis
  below.If you enjoy earning phenomenal cash back rewards, you’ll love this card.
  The Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express combines terrific cash back with
  a 0% intro APR and great American Express benefits. It starts off with a $150 bonus
  after you spend $1,000 in the first 3 months. If you use your card like a typical
  consumer, it should be pretty easy to meet these requirements. You can even pay
  for your mortgage and your utilities with the card (if these entities accept credit
  cards – most do) to help accrue the initial $1,000 and earn you additional cash
  back over time.You’ll also earn a whopping 6% cash back at US supermarkets on your
  first $6K in grocery purchases each year, after that you earn 1% back. If you do
  a lot of food shopping, this is a huge bonus and a great way to earn extra cash
  as the 6% can add up to substantial cash back. You can even think of it as an effective
  6% discount on your groceries when you pay with this card – a pretty great ‘coupon’!In
  addition you’ll earn an unlimited 3% back at US gas stations and 3% back at select
  department stores like Sears, Macys, Kohl’s, Nordstrom, JC Penney and many more.
  The 3% back on gas can take a little of the sting out of filling up your tank, and
  if you shop at the select department stores the extra 3% back can make your purchase
  that much more enjoyable. Note that there is no limit on the amount of cash back
  you can earn at this 3% rate so if you’re a big spender on either gas or department
  stores, this card is likely a no-brainer. The rest of your card purchases will earn
  a very decent 1% cash back. You can redeem your earned cash back for a statement
  credit, gift card (including AmEx gift cards) or items in their online shopping
  mall.Along with great cash back rewards, Blue Cash PreferredÂ cardholders pay no
  interest for the first 15 months on both purchases and balance transfers. This 0%
  APR period will take you into 2017 interest-free, and can help you pay down any
  card purchases or balance transfers without owing interest fees.World travelers
  will enjoy that Blue Cash Preferred featuresÂ chip-enabled technology, making it
  easier to pay for purchases outside the U.S. Â International merchants, particularly
  in Europe, are starting to require this technology in order to accept your credit
  card for payment.Having an American Express card also means you get great benefits
  like extended warranties on eligible purchases, purchase protection and return protection.
  And vacations can be easier with car rental loss/damage insurance, travel accident
  insurance and their roadside assistance hotline. Plus you get exclusive access to
  ticket presales and card member-only events.Blue Cash Preferred does charge a $75
  annual fee, which may seem like a lot but is typically something you can more than
  make up for through the cash back rewards you’ll accrue over the course of the year.
  If this is something you’re not willing to compromise on, its highly-rated sister
  card might be more up your alley. TheÂ Blue Cash Everyday Card from American ExpressÂ doesn’t
  charge any annual fees, features a 15-month 0% APR, and you’ll earn 3% back at US
  supermarkets, 2% back as gas stations and select department stores and 1% back on
  everything else.Although earning 6% on groceries and 3% at gas stations and department
  stores is pretty great, if you don’t typically spend much at these places then you
  are probably better off with a card that offers a higher flat rate back on all purchases.
  Our favorite in this category is the Citi Double Cash Card. It features an effective
  2% cash back on all purchases as well as no annual fee and the ability to get your
  rewards via check or direct deposit. You should also be aware that purchases at
  warehouses and superstores aren’t eligible for the 6% cash back with Blue Cash Preferred.
  Instead you’ll earn the standard 1% cash back, which is still pretty darn good as
  many cards won’t give you any cash back at all for shopping at places likeÂ Costco,
  Target and Walmart. Superstores and warehouses also aren’t eligible for the 3% back
  on gas, you’ll get 1% back there too. If you’re not sure about how this might affect
  you, use our free Cash Back Card Calculator to estimate how much you might earn
  with each of the different cash back cards given your spending patterns.If you enjoy
  traveling outside the U.S., be aware that Blue Cash Preferred charges a 2.7% foreign
  transaction fee. This charge can add up over time, particularly if you’re making
  all your international purchases on the card. If this isn’t something you’re willing
  to consider take a look at the Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards card, which
  doesn’t charge any foreign transaction fees and offers 1.5% cash back on all purchases.The
  cash back rewards for Blue Cash Preferred are very generous, but you aren’t able
  to receive a check or direct deposit to your bank account with the money from your
  rewards. Instead you need toÂ redeem your rewards for a statement credit on your
  account, or for gifts cards and other merchandise. While a statement credit is just
  the same as cash to most people, if you prefer to get cash in your hand, check out
  the aforementioned Citi Double Cash Card, which offers the ability to get your rewards
  via check or direct deposit.Finally, you do need to have excellent credit (often
  considered to be a credit score above 720 but sometimes considered a score over
  750) to be approved for Blue Cash Preferred. If your credit is not quite at that
  level, you should consider one of these cards for less-than-perfect credit.Blue
  Cash Preferred is a terrific card for anyone with excellent credit who wants to
  get big cash back rewards on groceries, gas and purchases at select department stores.
  In fact, the 6% back at supermarkets is the highest rate we’ve seen offered to consumers
  in any category. Plus, you can take advantage of the 15-month 0% APR on balance
  transfers and purchases. It does have an annual fee, and if you shop at superstores
  and warehouse stores you’ll earn the standard 1% instead of the higher cash back
  rates. You also can’t get your rewards in the form of a check or direct deposit
  and it does charge foreign transaction fees. If these are significant factors to
  you, consider some of the options detailed above. Overall though, Blue Cash Preferred
  is our #1 rated cash back card and a great choice for a strong cash back card.Visit

  blue card, are gimmicks and should not be considered seriously by most.  Annual
  fees add to the disincentive.  Sticke with the few cards offering 1 1/2 % and in
  some cases 2% on almost all purchases without fees or limits. 1% airline mile cards
  are no better.  The Fidelity Investments card, available as AMEX or Mastercard,
  through FIA Card Services, is one such card at 2%.When it is 6% on groceries and
  3% on gas… can you buy items at Kroger for 6% cash back, and then turn around and
  buy Kroger gas (because that gives you a discount at the pump) at 3% cash back?
  Or can that apply to gift cards bought at Kroger (which grants 4x reward points)?If
  all of that falls in line, for every $25 you spend at Kroger, you get 6% back, ($1.50)
  then you get 10 cents off on your gas price, with 10 gallons ($1) and 3% back on
  that…Spend $100 at Kroger (6% back is $6), get $1.00 off per gallon of gas. Ten
  gallons at $2.80 goes down to $1.80 (saves $10), spending $18 upon which you get
  3% back, ($0.54) … you’re saving  $16.54. Do that consistently on average for a
  year and you save  just under $200. That excludes using the $100 gift card purchase
  being used for additional 6% or 3% cash back on using it.I have an American Express
  credit card. I have it because it is very generous in providing cash back. However,
  I do not use it for many purchases because of the problems discussed prior to this
  entry. I was offered a Blue Cash card and declined it. I do not wish to pay a credit
  card that requires me to pay a fee for using it. Amex has some good cash back features
  BUT make sure you pay your balance every month when due.Your fee and some of the
  fine print makes it so I will not use AE after Costco Dumps it.ANY CREDIT CARD is
  only good for keeping a record of your spending, and the coinvience of NOT CARRYING
  CASH. And THE ONLY WAY that you can come out “ON TOP”, is IF you PAY YOUR TOTAL
  BALANCE OFF at the end of each month WNEN BILLED. IF you don’t pay your total balance
  at the end of each month, the PERCENTAGE OF PENALITY  YOU WILL BE LIABLE FOR WILL
  “EAT YOU ALIVE”, and CONTINUE TO EAT YOU ALIVE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING MONTHS UNTIL
  YOU HAVE PAID OFF YOUR BALANCE INTO THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH. YOU MUST KNOW
  THIS, AND IF YOU CANNOT PAY OFF YOUR BALANCE “IN FULL” AT THE END OF EACH MONTH,
  THEN YOU SHOULD “RUN FROM OWNING ANY CREDIT CARDS!!!!!!eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!The rebate
  ceiling on AMEX Preferred Blue detracts from its appeal because the hefty fee targets
  the big spenders.  The Fidelity Amex is my go-to card for rewards, but Discover’s
  it Card comes in second.  Discover nominally offers an unlimited 1% rebate, but
  its merchant offers make it easy to get 5%, 10% or much more.  In addition, Discover
  will double your cumulatively  earned rebates over the initial 12 months.  One last
  point: Discover has, by far, the best service of any card; telephone reps are well
  trained, articulate, courteous and all located within the U.S.You would have to
  spend $1250 at a true grocery store (Kroger, Safeway, Albertsons) just for the 6%
  cash back to cover the $75 annual fee, or $2500 at stand-alone gas stations (not
  discount stations like Wal-Mart or Costco). Still, many grocery stores offer lower
  prices than the big discount chains on food so you can save money. Just be careful
  to “fence off” the money you would have spent out of your checking account or paycheck
  so you can pay the credit card bill when it arrives next month.I got this card for
  my day to day use and found it to be very disappointing.  I’m not getting much back,
  their website is annoying, getting the rewards is a special exception, and I never
  got any $150 bonus., also many places don’t take AMEX.  I think this card is just
  good for them.I was really excited about this card since I am not a traveler and
  was looking for a deal on gas and groceries.  I did not know about the grocery limitation
  until just last week.  I do shop for groceries at Walmart more and more.  So those
  purchases make having this card worthless.  It is also worth noting that there are
  restrictions on gas stations as well. Only “stand alone” stations qualify.  I called
  today to get a listing of the gas stations and the person with whom I spoke was
  not clear.  I do not think Von’s or Costco type places qualify.  So you have to
  pay higher prices at name brand gas stations to save.  Go figure.One problem that
  I haven’t seen discussed is that you only get the 6% rebate from “true” grocery
  stores/chains.  However, since I buy most of our groceries at Walmart, I wouldn’t
  get back the promised 6% on grocery purchases.  That’s because most credit cards
  use a code to designate the primary business that is transacted at each store that
  accepts its credit cards.  I have no idea what Walmart’s primary business code is,
  but I’d be surprised if it is groceries.  Therefore, instead of getting back 6%
  on groceries bought at Walmart, as your article espouses, you may get back only
  1%, unless you buy them from a recognized grocery store/chain.  Makes the $75 annual
  fee a waste of money compared to Citibank’s newer Double Cash card which returns
  2% on everything, and has no annual fee.As the former owner of a Car Stereo Shop
  I only put on a sale twice a year. My customers knew that when that time came then
  it was legitimate. I generally held one near Back to school and then at the end
  of January. Back to school to get the teens in to buy and end of January till the
  end of February to lure the Tax refund money as well as to clear out old inventory.
  Small businesses is where you will find “true sales”. Get to know a local shop.
  As for Credit Cards? I took them and added a 6 percent fee. Yes, you the customer
  pays for all transaction fees. So all these cards do is pay you back for what you
  paid us. I would not take Amex at all. Trans fees for merchants makes it not worth
  taking at all. Same with Discover cards.As the former owner of a Car Stereo Shop

  You are the loser no matter how you add it , divide it or multiply it by two. (its a saying)
- |
  Merchants add the cost they have to pay to the credit card companies for you and me to swipe our debit or credit cards.

  So we are really getting pennies for the dollars we lose every year by allowing the industry to move us from cash to credit and debit…because the only winner is the credit card companies…its a genius idea and we are sucking it up.Wish I had the time to give you detailed explanation of how it all works…but my advice is stop spending…nothing is on special and nothing is half off….its all junk that is over priced and to get you to buy it…you need to see the red sticker that fools your brain…because this is how you have been trained since being a kid.Good luck!This is one example of the rich getting richer cause this card is only offered to those with excellent credit.

  Hope you can offer this card to the middle class with not so excellent credit.If you spend over $2,500/year at a qualified grocery store, there is no reason to get the free card: Blue Card (no fee): $2,500*.03 = $75
- |
  Blue Preferred Card (w/$75 fee): $2,500*.06-$75 = $75I never though that I would buy into a credit card with a fee. However, this is by far the best credit card I ever had. I use this card with the no fee Amazon Visa (3% on Amazon purchases, 2% at restaurants and pharmacies, 1% everything else.)Fidelity Amex  gives you 2% on all purchases with no limit.  We do that for all we can charge and it usually allows us to buy a ticket to go wherever we want with no airline hassel. THERE IS NO ANNUAL CHARGE just have a Fidelity account.And as a business owner this is why I don’t take AMX  at ALL !! Guess who pays for the 6% it sure isn’t AMX !!!Ray, the first post here and guy without a PHD must be wrong on his calculations. Spending $15,000 annually there is NO WAY he can accumulate more than $3000 in cashback. That would be over 20%. He must have pushed the wrong buttons on his calculator or forgot to use the right decimal. Maybe $300, but no way $3,000.I used the calculator and for spending 15k a year it shows i would get over 3k per year cashback. While I don’t have my PHD in math I am fairly certain that there is no way the calculations on that screen are accurate. Does anyone even try this stuff out before putting it online?Thank You SO much for all of this info.  I only have a bank debit card and did not know of all these cards that offered cash back.

  One problem, my cred is not excellent only good. What card would I be eligible for, if any?

  Thanks again,

  Jane LocklearI get 7% off on groceries! I use my Citi Double Cashback card to get 2% and shop only on senior Wednesdays to get another 5% from my local Kroger and/or Publix./the rewards or cash back that you earn is actually paid for by the business owner where you used the card.  It occurs through a higher fee  charged to the business to process the cardThe Sam’s Club credit card (not the membership card) has a 5% cash back on gasoline purchases from any station.If you look at it that you get 3% off groc. with the free card it would take longer to recoup your $75 annual fee.  I do use the free Am Ex for all the groc. I can but my go-to store is Aldi’s for  the best price.  Aldi’s does not take any charge cards – just debit/cash etc.

  I have the Sam’s card too for the 5% back on gas and 3% on travel.  I have 2 cards with the rotating catagories – Chase Freedom and Discover It. so the quarter they are giving 5% back in a catagory I use that particular card.  I like the restaurant 5% quarters and Home Improvement stores 5%.  Currently Discover is offering 5% back for amazon.com, clothing and dept. stores which is good for the Christmas buying season.  I just don’t like the idea of paying $75 to have any card when the others are all free.  I also use a AARP Chase card for restaurants which is 3% off if there is no better deal @ Discover or Chase Freedom.  I love the free reward $ and/or gift cards.I just took your advice, applied online and was approved right away. I’m even doing a balance transfer to save even more money! Thanks for much for the info!!I absolutely love this card. When you add the benefits and rewards you get, the card pays for itself. I started off with the no annual fee cash card from AMEX & soon upgraded to the AMEX preferred when I realized just how much more my rewards would be with this card. I spend over $500. monthly on groceries, even more holiday months and so the rewards have really added. Like to use the card for gas too. Right now I have over $450. in cash rewards which I will use to purchase gift cards this Xmas season. I highly recommend this card . My only advise is to do as I do, pay your bill off monthly so that it is interest free and the only one earning is you. Love my card!I am about to cancel my membership and give myself  $75 back to me. Sams club MC rebates 5% on Gas, 3% on travel and restaurants and 1% on rest. Citi double rewards is 2% on all purchases. Both these cards are free of fees. Of course one needs to be Sams member.I buy most of my groceries at Costco where most items are already discounted more that the 6%.  After April you’ll need a Citibank Visa card there which will provide a 1 or 2% additional rebate, depending on your membership status.  They’ll also match the current 3% rebate at all gas stations.  This one doesn’t sound like the one for me.  Look into the Am ex solid blue card with no annual fee as a good partner to the new Costco Visa.Too bad the yearly fee is so high AND that so few places accept American Express–at least from my past experiences with AE. I refuse to pay a fee to be eligible for cash-back.You must spend $1250 on groceries or $2500 on gas (75/.06 and 75/.03)  just to break even with the $75 annual fee. $1875 and $7500 before you break even on a regular 2% back on everything card.I have had this card for 3 years and it is great.  Like with every other card, it gets paid off every month, so there is no interest charges.  And between me and my roommate, we easily spend right at $500 per month at the grocery store and then gas, with the strict rule, those are the only two places the card goes.  It’s like getting a 6% discount on our grocery bill.  Can’t beat it! I haven’t tried it yet, but if you throw some coupons on top of that, you could save some serious cash.And this is why I don’t accept Amex at my businessI really hate these cards that offer different rates. I have a Capital One that gives me 2% on everything. I don’t have to remember what works for more points. And it was great fun paying for $25,000 of my new truck on the card.debt free more moneyIf Walmart and BJ’s and Sam’s Club stores are not considered grocery stores it could be an issue with the Amex card. But if you spend $5000 at a regular grocery store a year around $400 a month it would still be $300 of the Amex Card rebate. Figure in $1500 for gasoline and that is another  $45 rebate. Still seems worthwhile almost like free money.I have never come across a mortgage that you can pay with credit carddfhSounds good but how long would it take an average person to spend enough to get the $75 fee back?I want to know more about the cute redhead.I have this card – thought what a great deal as much groceries that I buy.  Doesn’t count as groceries at Wal-Mart or any grocery store that sells merchandise too.  Still get 1%, but not 3% or 6%.  For the most part I have only been getting 1% for everywhere that I shop  around my area.I have this card – thought what a great deal as much groceries that I buy.

I use my Cap One Venture card for everything else (and grocery stores after my $6,000 limit) to get 2% on all of that. You CAN use it at Kroger for the 6% cash back, so I use it to buy gift cards there for other stores. That gives me both double fuel points and the 6% cash back.

  As far as keeping track of spending, the online system automatically does that for you when you sign in to your account. I see no reason why you wouldn’t want this card, especially if you are buying groceries (and gift cards) for 2 or more people throughout the year. A single person who doesn’t do much grocery shopping likely wouldn’t benefit much, but for the right situation it’s perfect!I use this card only at grocery stores until I hit $6,000. That’s $360.

This Amex card would have given me a total reward of $586 at a cost of $150.  The net reward — with the strict limits on what it could be used for — would have been equal to 1.6%.  But a while back I switched to Cap One and get 1.5% on everything.  Amex may be a useful card for some people, but it’s not accepted in lots of places, so why should I switch for 0.1% and still have to use a different card much of the time.Over the last 24 months I spent $4000 for groceries, $400 for gas, and $22,600 for other using my Discover card.

They only give you 1% back at the grocery stores where most of us shop, like Walmart,  Kroger, and Meijers. When I called American express to ask why I only received 1% instead of 3% at Meijers, Kroger etc. they told me those stores are not true grocery stores. I cancelled my card.Be sure you understand what American Express calls a grocery store. They only give you 1% back at the grocery stores where most of us shop, like Walmart,  Kroger, and Meijers.

I get much more on the old Blue Cash which gives an unlimited 5% on groceries after spending a total of $6500 on the card. The $6500 spend is equivalent to a annual fee because of the forgone cash back and is therefore similar to the $65 fee for the Blue Cash Preferred.In my opinion the Blue Cash Preferred represents an attempt to reduce benefits without appearing to do so. Citi Double and Capital One are much better deals.I don’t consider Ms. Lockyer’s reporting to be best in class.6% of $6000 is $360.

My Capital One Venture card, though gives a straight 2% back on everything no matter what you spend the money on.  The only caveat is that they do it in points, and you have to go online and apply the points to remove the charges on the card.  It’s easiest for travel expenses, but since I spend more than 2% of my purchases on the card on travel-related things, erasing them is easy.This might be OK if you don’t mind keeping careful track of what you are spending and when.

We look very carefully at our expenses, including credit card charges.  We noticed that the charge to the non-profit varied with the card used by the customer/client.    Charges ranged from about 1% to almost 7%, depending upon the plan chosen by the cardholder.  Simple cards have the lowest charges, cash back cards have the higher charges.

It only offers 1% for the first $6500 of purchases in a “12-month period beginning on your card anniversary”.  But after that, I get 5% on “Everyday purchases” (gas, groceries) and 1% on everything else.  Almost the inverse of the card mentioned in the article…  However, definitely better than the Sallie Mae MC ($250 of CHARGES a month=$12.50 a month), as I spend that much on groceries in a week.

I see and read many comments on the drawbacks of credit cards.  Like any tool, it must be used for what it was intended.  I have American Express Blue Cash and the card is accepted everywhere I have needed to use it.  The card does exactly what they claim.  The 6% on groceries is a true rebate.  The posting claiming that credit cards are evil and are not preferred is not a completely true statement.  Misuse and improper use of credit is what is bad.  I do no use checks. This is just a tragedy waiting to happen.  Unlike a credit card.  You are not protected by issue someone a check.. Your check has everything on it for someone to commit fraud and empty your bank account.  At the bottom of your check is your entire banking routing number and bank account number.  A criminal just scans your check and begins printing counterfeit checks from your account.   A credit card limits your loss to $25.00 for unauthorized purchases.  On the issue of Cash.. To buy groceries.. fill the gas tank and pay with cash would require I have hundreds and hundreds of dollar of cash in my pocket and require constant visit to ATM or bank to replenish my wallet.  The Credit card allow to purchase online and order items. I can hold/reserve a future purchase and I am able to cancel with ease.  The fact a company gives a reward for the use of the card is good business sense.  Vendors and store owners build the cost in the use of credit card.  Sure, as an owner can offer a discount for use of cash.  I find this more popular for stores who do not wish to sales tax and income tax purpose.  With this all being said.  If you can handle a credit card.  American Express Blue is fantastic and web, mobile and customer support is superb and polished.I  own and have  owned over the years several varieties of rebate credit cards.  I see and read many comments on the drawbacks of credit cards.  Like any tool, it must be used for what it was intended.  I have American Express Blue Cash and the card is accepted everywhere I have needed to use it.  The card does exactly what they claim.  The 6% on groceries is a true rebate.

So the max “reward” you get is $360 – $75 (Annual fee) = $285. Remember this is in a year and NOT A  MONTH. Check out Sallie Mae Mastercard which is IN A MONTH (I too am looking for a better card and Sallie Mae MC seems far better).As some people pointed out, this card pays 6% of $6000 spent in a year AND NOT A MONTH.

  That’s why I do not accept American Express at my business. They are way to expensive for me. Discover card’s fees are good and Visa & MasterCard fees are fair. I prefer my customers to pay with cash or check. Enticing people to use a credit card because of a “cash back” benefit is just plain deceptive.Unfortunately it’s the business that have to cover the cost of the card’s benefits.

The AmEx Blue Cash Preferred Card gives you 3% more for groceries (6%) and 1% more for gasoline (3%), but you can get 3%-5% off gas with other no-annual fee cards (5% off Jan-Mar with Discover, 5% off July-Sept with Chase Freedom Visa, 3% all-year with Bank of Am. Cash Rewards Mastercard).  If you do most of your grocery shopping at standalone supermarkets, then that extra 3% cash-back for the AmEx…Preferred Card may pay for your $75 annual fee – though note the price savings you get at the warehouses and discount stores (Costco, Walmart, Aldi, etc.) is much more than that 6% vs 0-1% difference.

  As I commented previously, I got this card in Nov. when I needed some auto work done and knew I’d qualify for charging $1000 in 90 days and getting a $150 cash-back reward subtracted from my statement – so I was willing to put up with the initial $75 annual fee.
- |
  I keep VERY detailed spending records – as well as seeing the cash-back totals build.  The Preferred Card’s not adding up for me because I don’t shop for enough in standalone supermarkets.
- |
  When Nov. (and my next $75-annual-fee) approaches, I’m going to switch to the no-annual fee American Express Blue Cash Everyday Card and use it primarily for the 3% off groceries. There are also occasional extra promotions worth signing up for.  Note that Chase Freedom Visa gives 5% cash-back for groceries from Jan-Mar and Bank of Am. Cash Rewards Mastercard does 2% all-year.

  Note that this comment’s conclusions ignore the typical $1500/qtr. limit on extra-cash-back from various cards since I never get that high.

If I spend $1,500/year on groceries, the Blue Cash card would save me $15/year for a $75/year fee.  The same card I use for groceries also gives me 5% cash back on gas, and I also never get close to the $250/month limit.  As far as getting 3% cash back at certain department stores, I have cards with rotating 5% categories that sometimes include department stores, but when I don’t have that offer I have another card that gives 2% cash back on everything.  I don’t spend enough at department stores for that extra 1% to help me very much.  My strategy is to have a variety of cards, and for each purchase I use the credit card that gives me the most cash back.  This would be a good card to have if they didn’t charge a fee.  If they waive the fee for the first year this would get me a little extra cash back, and especially the $150 bonus, then I’d cancel before they charge the fee.I only average about $100-$125/month on groceries, and get 5% cash back.

When I asked them why, they stated they couldn’t afford their charges.  I assume this is attributed to LoomisWeb’s comment that vendors are paying for the cash back. I would rather have a credit card that is almost unerverslly accepted without  service fee.I was considering this card; however, I foud a two small businesses in my neighborhood posted signs stating that they do not accept American Express credit cards.

It is simply taken directly from the merchants, more often than not small, Mom and Pop stores, who are given no choice in the matter. American Express and other card companies deduct that money from the merchant and then take the credit for generously giving it back to the purchaser. Of course they also skim a healthy amount off the top as well. So the naive consumer eagerly embraces the fairy tale idea of getting “cash back” (by paying more for his purchase), instead of realizing that the merchant would much rather discount the price to the buyer directly.You DO know that the cash back doesn’t come from American Express, don’t you?

  As it is, you’re paying 6% or 3% LESS for groceries and 3%-2% less on gas and 1% less for everything else than those who advise “always pay with cash,” and you even with an avg. salary you’re getting hundreds per year in cash-back if you pay-off your entire statement every month and keep track of spending so you don’t over-spend your budget.I got this American Express Blue Cash Preferred card in November 2014, but only because there was a $150 bonus if I charged $1000 with it in 90 days, which was subtracted from my card balance as soon as I achieved it.  That paid for two years worth of $75 fees and gave me time to evaluate it without cost.  It’s not looking like a keeper!

  It may not be worth that $75/yr compared to the similar no-annual-fee American Express Blue Cash Everyday card – and I’m considering switching over to it before my 2nd year’s $75 annual fee comes up in November 2015: as of March 9, 2015, after nearly 4 months with the card, I’ve only built up $23.61 in cash-back (not counting that $100 one-time bonus), $10.56 is due to 1% cash-back for a $1056 charge that I would have gotten the same back with any of my no-annual-fee cards.The big deals with the Preferred card are 6% cash-back for standalone supermarkets vs 3% for the Everyday card (both do only 1% at Walmart, Costco, etc.), 3% cash-back at standalone gas stations for Preferred vs 2% for Everyday, and special permanent or time-limited online deals for Preferred like “spend $25 at  Papa Johns and get $5 cash-back.”  Both cards give at least 1% cash-back on all purchases.Preferred may not work well if you buy most of your groceries at places like Costco, Target, Walmart and Sam’s Club – and I’ve been averaging 6.74% off with Walmart’s “Savings Catcher” combined with their no-fee Bluebird card and all my no-annual-fee cards do 1% cash-back at Walmart on top of it.  Most of the special offers aren’t bargains and apply to above-average cost stores like Whole Foods.

  Two of my cards give 5% cash-back six months of the year for standalone gas stations (though you have to sign-up for the programs on your card’s webpage): Discover Card (Jan-Mar) and Chase Freedom Visa (July-Sept) so the Preferred card is basically good for me for a minority of my groceries and 6 months of gasoline.  Since I may get the Bank of America Cash Rewards Mastercard, which does 3% cash-back for gasoline, that means the Preferred’s 6% or Everyday’s 3% off for standalone supermarkets are my main reasons for using them.  The only other no-annual-fee card besides Everyday that gives more than 1% off supermarkets is that B of A Cash Rewards Mastercard which gives 2%, so Everyday would be my card of choice in supermarkets, where I do tend to shop for small amounts of things most weeks – not enough to justify the $75 annual fee to get another 3% cash-back.I got this American Express Blue Cash Preferred card in November 2014, but only because there was a $150 bonus if I charged $1000 with it in 90 days, which was subtracted from my card balance as soon as I achieved it.

  card if they can still afford to give you 6% back.  Now imagine how much less ever
  thing would be if “nobody” used plastic and paid only cash.  Of course the government
  hates this because there is no way to track cash spending.yes Louie the cash comes

  Cash Preferred from American Express – the Right Cash Back Card for You?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby
  Tasha Lockyer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 18, 2015\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUpdated:
  October 16, 2015\nThere are a lot of great options for cash back credit cards right
  now, offering very compelling cash back rates and lucrative intro bonuses. But the
  one card that comes out on top in our analysis of the average person’s spending
  pattern is the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express (a NextAdvisor advertiser).Â 
  Its 6% cash back rate on groceries is the highest we’ve found from any card in any
  category and its 3% back on gas and department stores is the highest year-round
  rate in those categories. To top it off, its $150 intro bonus is the highest of
  any cash back card we’ve reviewed. We decided to dive deeper into its potential
  earnings, benefits and detriments to see if it is a smart choice for you. In short,
  if you have excellent credit and fairly typical spending patterns, it’s probably
  your best choice. In fact, it’s so great that I have one and use it frequently,
  enjoying generous cash back rewards. You can learn more about Blue Cash Preferred
  in our detailed analysis below.\nThe Highlights\nIf you enjoy earning phenomenal
  cash back rewards, you’ll love this card. The Blue Cash Preferred Card from American
  Express combines terrific cash back with a 0% intro APR and great American Express
  benefits. It starts off with a $150 bonus after you spend $1,000 in the first 3
  months. If you use your card like a typical consumer, it should be pretty easy to
  meet these requirements. You can even pay for your mortgage and your utilities with
  the card (if these entities accept credit cards – most do) to help accrue the initial
  $1,000 and earn you additional cash back over time.\nYou’ll also earn a whopping
  6% cash back at US supermarkets on your first $6K in grocery purchases each year,
  after that you earn 1% back. If you do a lot of food shopping, this is a huge bonus
  and a great way to earn extra cash as the 6% can add up to substantial cash back.
  You can even think of it as an effective 6% discount on your groceries when you
  pay with this card – a pretty great ‘coupon’!\nIn addition you’ll earn an unlimited
  3% back at US gas stations and 3% back at select department stores like Sears, Macys,
  Kohl’s, Nordstrom, JC Penney and many more. The 3% back on gas can take a little
  of the sting out of filling up your tank, and if you shop at the select department
  stores the extra 3% back can make your purchase that much more enjoyable. Note that
  there is no limit on the amount of cash back you can earn at this 3% rate so if
  you’re a big spender on either gas or department stores, this card is likely a no-brainer.
  The rest of your card purchases will earn a very decent 1% cash back. You can redeem
  your earned cash back for a statement credit, gift card (including AmEx gift cards)
  or items in their online shopping mall.\nAlong with great cash back rewards, Blue
  Cash PreferredÂ cardholders pay no interest for the first 15 months on both purchases
  and balance transfers. This 0% APR period will take you into 2017 interest-free,
  and can help you pay down any card purchases or balance transfers without owing
  interest fees.\nWorld travelers will enjoy that Blue Cash Preferred featuresÂ chip-enabled
  technology, making it easier to pay for purchases outside the U.S. Â International
  merchants, particularly in Europe, are starting to require this technology in order
  to accept your credit card for payment.\nHaving an American Express card also means
  you get great benefits like extended warranties on eligible purchases, purchase
  protection and return protection. And vacations can be easier with car rental loss/damage
  insurance, travel accident insurance and their roadside assistance hotline. Plus
  you get exclusive access to ticket presales and card member-only events.\nThings
  To Consider\nBlue Cash Preferred does charge a $75 annual fee, which may seem like
  a lot but is typically something you can more than make up for through the cash
  back rewards you’ll accrue over the course of the year. If this is something you’re
  not willing to compromise on, its highly-rated sister card might be more up your
  alley. TheÂ Blue Cash Everyday Card from American ExpressÂ doesn’t charge any annual
  fees, features a 15-month 0% APR, and you’ll earn 3% back at US supermarkets, 2%
  back as gas stations and select department stores and 1% back on everything else.\nAlthough
  earning 6% on groceries and 3% at gas stations and department stores is pretty great,
  if you don’t typically spend much at these places then you are probably better off
  with a card that offers a higher flat rate back on all purchases. Our favorite in
  this category is the Citi Double Cash Card. It features an effective 2% cash back
  on all purchases as well as no annual fee and the ability to get your rewards via
  check or direct deposit. You should also be aware that purchases at warehouses and
  superstores aren’t eligible for the 6% cash back with Blue Cash Preferred. Instead
  you’ll earn the standard 1% cash back, which is still pretty darn good as many cards
  won’t give you any cash back at all for shopping at places likeÂ Costco, Target
  and Walmart. Superstores and warehouses also aren’t eligible for the 3% back on
  gas, you’ll get 1% back there too. If you’re not sure about how this might affect
  you, use our free Cash Back Card Calculator to estimate how much you might earn
  with each of the different cash back cards given your spending patterns.\nIf you
  enjoy traveling outside the U.S., be aware that Blue Cash Preferred charges a 2.7%
  foreign transaction fee. This charge can add up over time, particularly if you’re
  making all your international purchases on the card. If this isn’t something you’re
  willing to consider take a look at the Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards card,
  which doesn’t charge any foreign transaction fees and offers 1.5% cash back on all
  purchases.\nThe cash back rewards for Blue Cash Preferred are very generous, but
  you aren’t able to receive a check or direct deposit to your bank account with the
  money from your rewards. Instead you need toÂ redeem your rewards for a statement
  credit on your account, or for gifts cards and other merchandise. While a statement
  credit is just the same as cash to most people, if you prefer to get cash in your
  hand, check out the aforementioned Citi Double Cash Card, which offers the ability
  to get your rewards via check or direct deposit.\nFinally, you do need to have excellent
  credit (often considered to be a credit score above 720 but sometimes considered
  a score over 750) to be approved for Blue Cash Preferred. If your credit is not
  quite at that level, you should consider one of these cards for less-than-perfect
  credit.\nShould You Apply For Blue Cash Preferred from American Express?\nBlue Cash
  Preferred is a terrific card for anyone with excellent credit who wants to get big
  cash back rewards on groceries, gas and purchases at select department stores. In
  fact, the 6% back at supermarkets is the highest rate we’ve seen offered to consumers
  in any category. Plus, you can take advantage of the 15-month 0% APR on balance
  transfers and purchases. It does have an annual fee, and if you shop at superstores
  and warehouse stores you’ll earn the standard 1% instead of the higher cash back
  rates. You also can’t get your rewards in the form of a check or direct deposit
  and it does charge foreign transaction fees. If these are significant factors to
  you, consider some of the options detailed above. Overall though, Blue Cash Preferred
  is our #1 rated cash back card and a great choice for a strong cash back card.\nVisit

  \ \n\t  \n\n      Cards with variable rebates, such as the AMEX blue card, are gimmicks
  and should not be considered seriously by most.  Annual fees add to the disincentive.
  \ Sticke with the few cards offering 1 1/2 % and in some cases 2% on almost all
  purchases without fees or limits. 1% airline mile cards are no better.  The Fidelity
  Investments card, available as AMEX or Mastercard, through FIA Card Services, is
  one such card at 2%.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n     \n      \n         \n
  \        Marcus \t  December 12, 2015\n      \n      \n\t  \n\t  \n\n      When
  it is 6% on groceries and 3% on gas… can you buy items at Kroger for 6% cash back,
  and then turn around and buy Kroger gas (because that gives you a discount at the
  pump) at 3% cash back? Or can that apply to gift cards bought at Kroger (which grants
  4x reward points)?\nIf all of that falls in line, for every $25 you spend at Kroger,
  you get 6% back, ($1.50) then you get 10 cents off on your gas price, with 10 gallons
  ($1) and 3% back on that…\nSpend $100 at Kroger (6% back is $6), get $1.00 off per
  gallon of gas. Ten gallons at $2.80 goes down to $1.80 (saves $10), spending $18
  upon which you get 3% back, ($0.54) … you’re saving  $16.54. Do that consistently
  on average for a year and you save  just under $200. That excludes using the $100
  gift card purchase being used for additional 6% or 3% cash back on using it.\n\n

  \t  December 9, 2015\n      \n      \n\t  \n\t  \n\n      I have an American Express
  credit card. I have it because it is very generous in providing cash back. However,
  I do not use it for many purchases because of the problems discussed prior to this
  entry. I was offered a Blue Cash card and declined it. I do not wish to pay a credit
  card that requires me to pay a fee for using it. Amex has some good cash back features
  BUT make sure you pay your balance every month when due.\n\n      \n               \n

  your spending, and the coinvience of NOT CARRYING CASH. And THE ONLY WAY that you
  can come out “ON TOP”, is IF you PAY YOUR TOTAL BALANCE OFF at the end of each month
  WNEN BILLED. IF you don’t pay your total balance at the end of each month, the PERCENTAGE
  OF PENALITY  YOU WILL BE LIABLE FOR WILL “EAT YOU ALIVE”, and CONTINUE TO EAT YOU
  ALIVE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING MONTHS UNTIL YOU HAVE PAID OFF YOUR BALANCE INTO THE
  SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH. YOU MUST KNOW THIS, AND IF YOU CANNOT PAY OFF YOUR BALANCE
  “IN FULL” AT THE END OF EACH MONTH, THEN YOU SHOULD “RUN FROM OWNING ANY CREDIT

  AMEX Preferred Blue detracts from its appeal because the hefty fee targets the big
  spenders.  The Fidelity Amex is my go-to card for rewards, but Discover’s it Card
  comes in second.  Discover nominally offers an unlimited 1% rebate, but its merchant
  offers make it easy to get 5%, 10% or much more.  In addition, Discover will double
  your cumulatively  earned rebates over the initial 12 months.  One last point: Discover
  has, by far, the best service of any card; telephone reps are well trained, articulate,
  courteous and all located within the U.S.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n

  (Kroger, Safeway, Albertsons) just for the 6% cash back to cover the $75 annual
  fee, or $2500 at stand-alone gas stations (not discount stations like Wal-Mart or
  Costco). Still, many grocery stores offer lower prices than the big discount chains
  on food so you can save money. Just be careful to “fence off” the money you would
  have spent out of your checking account or paycheck so you can pay the credit card
  bill when it arrives next month.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n     \n

  \ \n\n      I got this card for my day to day use and found it to be very disappointing.
  \ I’m not getting much back, their website is annoying, getting the rewards is a
  special exception, and I never got any $150 bonus., also many places don’t take
  AMEX.  I think this card is just good for them.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n

  \ \n\t  \n\n      I was really excited about this card since I am not a traveler
  and was looking for a deal on gas and groceries.  I did not know about the grocery
  limitation until just last week.  I do shop for groceries at Walmart more and more.
  \ So those purchases make having this card worthless.  It is also worth noting that
  there are restrictions on gas stations as well. Only “stand alone” stations qualify.
  \ I called today to get a listing of the gas stations and the person with whom I
  spoke was not clear.  I do not think Von’s or Costco type places qualify.  So you
  have to pay higher prices at name brand gas stations to save.  Go figure.\n\n      \n

  haven’t seen discussed is that you only get the 6% rebate from “true” grocery stores/chains.
  \ However, since I buy most of our groceries at Walmart, I wouldn’t get back the
  promised 6% on grocery purchases.  That’s because most credit cards use a code to
  designate the primary business that is transacted at each store that accepts its
  credit cards.  I have no idea what Walmart’s primary business code is, but I’d be
  surprised if it is groceries.  Therefore, instead of getting back 6% on groceries
  bought at Walmart, as your article espouses, you may get back only 1%, unless you
  buy them from a recognized grocery store/chain.  Makes the $75 annual fee a waste
  of money compared to Citibank’s newer Double Cash card which returns 2% on everything,
  and has no annual fee.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n     \n      \n

  and added a 6 percent fee. Yes, you the customer pays for all transaction fees.

  card companies for you and me to swipe our debit or credit cards.\nSo we are really
  getting pennies for the dollars we lose every year by allowing the industry to move
  us from cash to credit and debit…because the only winner is the credit card companies…its
  a genius idea and we are sucking it up.\nWish I had the time to give you detailed
  explanation of how it all works…but my advice is stop spending…nothing is on special
  and nothing is half off….its all junk that is over priced and to get you to buy
  it…you need to see the red sticker that fools your brain…because this is how you

  price.  Aldi’s does not take any charge cards – just debit/cash etc.\nI have the
  Sam’s card too for the 5% back on gas and 3% on travel.  I have 2 cards with the
  rotating catagories – Chase Freedom and Discover It. so the quarter they are giving
  5% back in a catagory I use that particular card.  I like the restaurant 5% quarters
  and Home Improvement stores 5%.  Currently Discover is offering 5% back for amazon.com,
  clothing and dept. stores which is good for the Christmas buying season.  I just
  don’t like the idea of paying $75 to have any card when the others are all free.
  \ I also use a AARP Chase card for restaurants which is 3% off if there is no better
  deal @ Discover or Chase Freedom.  I love the free reward $ and/or gift cards.\n\n

  and rewards you get, the card pays for itself. I started off with the no annual
  fee cash card from AMEX & soon upgraded to the AMEX preferred when I realized just
  how much more my rewards would be with this card. I spend over $500. monthly on
  groceries, even more holiday months and so the rewards have really added. Like to
  use the card for gas too. Right now I have over $450. in cash rewards which I will
  use to purchase gift cards this Xmas season. I highly recommend this card . My only
  advise is to do as I do, pay your bill off monthly so that it is interest free and
  the only one earning is you. Love my card!\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n

  off every month, so there is no interest charges.  And between me and my roommate,
  we easily spend right at $500 per month at the grocery store and then gas, with
  the strict rule, those are the only two places the card goes.  It’s like getting
  a 6% discount on our grocery bill.  Can’t beat it! I haven’t tried it yet, but if

  use my Cap One Venture card for everything else (and grocery stores after my $6,000

  \        Justin \t  August 18, 2015\n      \n      \n\t  \n\t  \n\n      I use this
  card only at grocery stores until I hit $6,000. That’s $360. I’ll take $285 after
  the fee! I use my Cap One Venture card for everything else (and grocery stores after
  my $6,000 limit) to get 2% on all of that. You CAN use it at Kroger for the 6% cash
  back, so I use it to buy gift cards there for other stores. That gives me both double
  fuel points and the 6% cash back.\nAs far as keeping track of spending, the online
  system automatically does that for you when you sign in to your account. I see no
  reason why you wouldn’t want this card, especially if you are buying groceries (and
  gift cards) for 2 or more people throughout the year. A single person who doesn’t
  do much grocery shopping likely wouldn’t benefit much, but for the right situation

  Cash which gives an unlimited 5% on groceries after spending a total of $6500 on
  the card. The $6500 spend is equivalent to a annual fee because of the forgone cash
  back and is therefore similar to the $65 fee for the Blue Cash Preferred.\nIn my

  the card is accepted everywhere I have needed to use it.  The card does exactly
  what they claim.  The 6% on groceries is a true rebate.  The posting claiming that
  credit cards are evil and are not preferred is not a completely true statement.
  \ Misuse and improper use of credit is what is bad.  I do no use checks. This is
  just a tragedy waiting to happen.  Unlike a credit card.  You are not protected
  by issue someone a check.. Your check has everything on it for someone to commit
  fraud and empty your bank account.  At the bottom of your check is your entire banking
  routing number and bank account number.  A criminal just scans your check and begins
  printing counterfeit checks from your account.   A credit card limits your loss
  to $25.00 for unauthorized purchases.  On the issue of Cash.. To buy groceries..
  fill the gas tank and pay with cash would require I have hundreds and hundreds of
  dollar of cash in my pocket and require constant visit to ATM or bank to replenish
  my wallet.  The Credit card allow to purchase online and order items. I can hold/reserve
  a future purchase and I am able to cancel with ease.  The fact a company gives a
  reward for the use of the card is good business sense.  Vendors and store owners
  build the cost in the use of credit card.  Sure, as an owner can offer a discount
  for use of cash.  I find this more popular for stores who do not wish to sales tax
  and income tax purpose.  With this all being said.  If you can handle a credit card.

  spent in a year AND NOT A MONTH. So the max “reward” you get is $360 – $75 (Annual
  fee) = $285. Remember this is in a year and NOT A  MONTH. Check out Sallie Mae Mastercard
  which is IN A MONTH (I too am looking for a better card and Sallie Mae MC seems
  far better).\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n     \n      \n         \n

  \t  March 22, 2015\n      \n      \n\t  \n\t  \n\n      For people who do mostly
  warehouse or discount grocery shopping,including myself, where all the credit cards
  I know give a max. 1% cash-back except for special promotions, I recommend the no-annual-fee
  American Express Blue Cash Everyday Card (3% off groceries at standalone supermarkets,
  2% off gasoline at standalone stations, 1% all-else) for it’s groceries savings.
  \ The AmEx Blue Cash Preferred Card gives you 3% more for groceries (6%) and 1%
  more for gasoline (3%), but you can get 3%-5% off gas with other no-annual fee cards
  (5% off Jan-Mar with Discover, 5% off July-Sept with Chase Freedom Visa, 3% all-year
  with Bank of Am. Cash Rewards Mastercard).  If you do most of your grocery shopping
  at standalone supermarkets, then that extra 3% cash-back for the AmEx…Preferred
  Card may pay for your $75 annual fee – though note the price savings you get at
  the warehouses and discount stores (Costco, Walmart, Aldi, etc.) is much more than
  that 6% vs 0-1% difference.\nAs I commented previously, I got this card in Nov.
  when I needed some auto work done and knew I’d qualify for charging $1000 in 90
  days and getting a $150 cash-back reward subtracted from my statement – so I was
  willing to put up with the initial $75 annual fee.\nI keep VERY detailed spending
  records – as well as seeing the cash-back totals build.  The Preferred Card’s not
  adding up for me because I don’t shop for enough in standalone supermarkets.\nWhen
  Nov. (and my next $75-annual-fee) approaches, I’m going to switch to the no-annual
  fee American Express Blue Cash Everyday Card and use it primarily for the 3% off
  groceries. There are also occasional extra promotions worth signing up for.  Note
  that Chase Freedom Visa gives 5% cash-back for groceries from Jan-Mar and Bank of
  Am. Cash Rewards Mastercard does 2% all-year.\nNote that this comment’s conclusions
  ignore the typical $1500/qtr. limit on extra-cash-back from various cards since
  I never get that high.\nAs you might infer from this message, I keep 5 cash-back
  rewards cards (besides those mentioned, I also have the Chase Amazon.com Visa: 3%
  off Amazon; 2% off drugstores, restaurants, stationary stores; 1% all else), using
  the right one at the right time to max. my cash-back rewards which were $540.43
  on an avg. income and frugal spending in 2014.  If I was going to keep one, it would
  be a tossup between the Chase Amazon.com Visa and the Bank of Am. Cash Rewards Mastercard.\n\n

  (5% off Jan-Mar with Discover, 5% off July-Sept with Chase Freedom Visa, 3% all-year
  with Bank of Am. Cash Rewards Mastercard).  If you do most of your grocery shopping
  at standalone supermarkets, then that extra 3% cash-back for the AmEx…Preferred
  Card may pay for your $75 annual fee – though note the price savings you get at
  the warehouses and discount stores (Costco, Walmart, Aldi, etc.) is much more than
  that 6% vs 0-1% difference.\nAs I commented previously, I got this card in Nov.
  when I needed some auto work done and knew I’d qualify for charging $1000 in 90
  days and getting a $150 cash-back reward subtracted from my statement – so I was
  willing to put up with the initial $75 annual fee.\nI keep VERY detailed spending
  records – as well as seeing the cash-back totals build.  The Preferred Card’s not
  adding up for me because I don’t shop for enough in standalone supermarkets.\nWhen
  Nov. (and my next $75-annual-fee) approaches, I’m going to switch to the no-annual
  fee American Express Blue Cash Everyday Card and use it primarily for the 3% off
  groceries. There are also occasional extra promotions worth signing up for.  Note
  that Chase Freedom Visa gives 5% cash-back for groceries from Jan-Mar and Bank of
  Am. Cash Rewards Mastercard does 2% all-year.\nNote that this comment’s conclusions
  ignore the typical $1500/qtr. limit on extra-cash-back from various cards since
  I never get that high.\nAs you might infer from this message, I keep 5 cash-back
  rewards cards (besides those mentioned, I also have the Chase Amazon.com Visa: 3%
  off Amazon; 2% off drugstores, restaurants, stationary stores; 1% all else), using
  the right one at the right time to max. my cash-back rewards which were $540.43
  on an avg. income and frugal spending in 2014.  If I was going to keep one, it would
  be a tossup between the Chase Amazon.com Visa and the Bank of Am. Cash Rewards Mastercard.\n\n

  on groceries, and get 5% cash back.  My card is limited to $250/month, but I’ve
  never gone over that.  If I spend $1,500/year on groceries, the Blue Cash card would
  save me $15/year for a $75/year fee.  The same card I use for groceries also gives
  me 5% cash back on gas, and I also never get close to the $250/month limit.  As
  far as getting 3% cash back at certain department stores, I have cards with rotating
  5% categories that sometimes include department stores, but when I don’t have that
  offer I have another card that gives 2% cash back on everything.  I don’t spend
  enough at department stores for that extra 1% to help me very much.  My strategy
  is to have a variety of cards, and for each purchase I use the credit card that
  gives me the most cash back.  This would be a good card to have if they didn’t charge
  a fee.  If they waive the fee for the first year this would get me a little extra
  cash back, and especially the $150 bonus, then I’d cancel before they charge the
  fee.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n     \n      \n         \n         Alan

  cards. When I asked them why, they stated they couldn’t afford their charges.  I
  assume this is attributed to LoomisWeb’s comment that vendors are paying for the
  cash back. I would rather have a credit card that is almost unerverslly accepted
  without  service fee.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n     \n      \n

  \     You DO know that the cash back doesn’t come from American Express, don’t you?
  It is simply taken directly from the merchants, more often than not small, Mom and
  Pop stores, who are given no choice in the matter. American Express and other card
  companies deduct that money from the merchant and then take the credit for generously
  giving it back to the purchaser. Of course they also skim a healthy amount off the
  top as well. So the naive consumer eagerly embraces the fairy tale idea of getting
  “cash back” (by paying more for his purchase), instead of realizing that the merchant
  would much rather discount the price to the buyer directly.\n\n      \n               \n

  \ \n\t  \n\n      Yes, Louie and others, the supermarkets have to raise prices to
  pay for card fees, but since most cards do 1% cash-back at them, the AmeX 6% (Preferred
  $75 annual fee) and 3% (Everyday no-annual-fee) return to you more than the prices
  are raised.\nAdditionally, if the supermarkets only accepted cash as some propose,
  it would reduce their sales and raise prices as well.\nAs it is, you’re paying 6%
  or 3% LESS for groceries and 3%-2% less on gas and 1% less for everything else than
  those who advise “always pay with cash,” and you even with an avg. salary you’re
  getting hundreds per year in cash-back if you pay-off your entire statement every
  month and keep track of spending so you don’t over-spend your budget.\n\n      \n

  \ \n\n      I got this American Express Blue Cash Preferred card in November 2014,
  but only because there was a $150 bonus if I charged $1000 with it in 90 days, which
  was subtracted from my card balance as soon as I achieved it.  That paid for two
  years worth of $75 fees and gave me time to evaluate it without cost.  It’s not
  looking like a keeper!\nIt may not be worth that $75/yr compared to the similar
  no-annual-fee American Express Blue Cash Everyday card – and I’m considering switching
  over to it before my 2nd year’s $75 annual fee comes up in November 2015: as of
  March 9, 2015, after nearly 4 months with the card, I’ve only built up $23.61 in
  cash-back (not counting that $100 one-time bonus), $10.56 is due to 1% cash-back
  for a $1056 charge that I would have gotten the same back with any of my no-annual-fee
  cards.\nThe big deals with the Preferred card are 6% cash-back for standalone supermarkets
  vs 3% for the Everyday card (both do only 1% at Walmart, Costco, etc.), 3% cash-back
  at standalone gas stations for Preferred vs 2% for Everyday, and special permanent
  or time-limited online deals for Preferred like “spend $25 at  Papa Johns and get
  $5 cash-back.”  Both cards give at least 1% cash-back on all purchases.\nPreferred
  may not work well if you buy most of your groceries at places like Costco, Target,
  Walmart and Sam’s Club – and I’ve been averaging 6.74% off with Walmart’s “Savings
  Catcher” combined with their no-fee Bluebird card and all my no-annual-fee cards
  do 1% cash-back at Walmart on top of it.  Most of the special offers aren’t bargains
  and apply to above-average cost stores like Whole Foods.\nTwo of my cards give 5%
  cash-back six months of the year for standalone gas stations (though you have to
  sign-up for the programs on your card’s webpage): Discover Card (Jan-Mar) and Chase
  Freedom Visa (July-Sept) so the Preferred card is basically good for me for a minority
  of my groceries and 6 months of gasoline.  Since I may get the Bank of America Cash
  Rewards Mastercard, which does 3% cash-back for gasoline, that means the Preferred’s
  6% or Everyday’s 3% off for standalone supermarkets are my main reasons for using
  them.  The only other no-annual-fee card besides Everyday that gives more than 1%
  off supermarkets is that B of A Cash Rewards Mastercard which gives 2%, so Everyday
  would be my card of choice in supermarkets, where I do tend to shop for small amounts
  of things most weeks – not enough to justify the $75 annual fee to get another 3%
  cash-back.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n     \n      \n         \n

  the cash comes from money you are forced to overpay when you use the credit card.
  \ Oddly charges are called discount points.  imagine how much the bank is charging
  the merchant ever time you use that card if they can still afford to give you 6%
  back.  Now imagine how much less ever thing would be if “nobody” used plastic and
  paid only cash.  Of course the government hates this because there is no way to
  track cash spending.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n     \n      \n         \n

  to our newsletter to get the latest deals and reviewsUpdated: October 16, 2015There
  are a lot of great options for cash back credit cards right now, offering very compelling
  cash back rates and lucrative intro bonuses. But the one card that comes out on
  top in our analysis of the average person’s spending pattern is the Blue Cash Preferred
  Card from American Express (a NextAdvisor advertiser).Â  Its 6% cash back rate on
  groceries is the highest we’ve found from any card in any category and its 3% back
  on gas and department stores is the highest year-round rate in those categories.
  To top it off, its $150 intro bonus is the highest of any cash back card we’ve reviewed.
  We decided to dive deeper into its potential earnings, benefits and detriments to
  see if it is a smart choice for you. In short, if you have excellent credit and
  fairly typical spending patterns, it’s probably your best choice. In fact, it’s
  so great that I have one and use it frequently, enjoying generous cash back rewards.
  You can learn more about Blue Cash Preferred in our detailed analysis below.If you
  enjoy earning phenomenal cash back rewards, you’ll love this card. The Blue Cash
  Preferred Card from American Express combines terrific cash back with a 0% intro
  APR and great American Express benefits. It starts off with a $150 bonus after you
  spend $1,000 in the first 3 months. If you use your card like a typical consumer,
  it should be pretty easy to meet these requirements. You can even pay for your mortgage
  and your utilities with the card (if these entities accept credit cards – most do)
  to help accrue the initial $1,000 and earn you additional cash back over time.You’ll
  also earn a whopping 6% cash back at US supermarkets on your first $6K in grocery
  purchases each year, after that you earn 1% back. If you do a lot of food shopping,
  this is a huge bonus and a great way to earn extra cash as the 6% can add up to
  substantial cash back. You can even think of it as an effective 6% discount on your
  groceries when you pay with this card – a pretty great ‘coupon’!In addition you’ll
  earn an unlimited 3% back at US gas stations and 3% back at select department stores
  like Sears, Macys, Kohl’s, Nordstrom, JC Penney and many more. The 3% back on gas
  can take a little of the sting out of filling up your tank, and if you shop at the
  select department stores the extra 3% back can make your purchase that much more
  enjoyable. Note that there is no limit on the amount of cash back you can earn at
  this 3% rate so if you’re a big spender on either gas or department stores, this
  card is likely a no-brainer. The rest of your card purchases will earn a very decent
  1% cash back. You can redeem your earned cash back for a statement credit, gift
  card (including AmEx gift cards) or items in their online shopping mall.Along with
  great cash back rewards, Blue Cash PreferredÂ cardholders pay no interest for the
  first 15 months on both purchases and balance transfers. This 0% APR period will
  take you into 2017 interest-free, and can help you pay down any card purchases or
  balance transfers without owing interest fees.World travelers will enjoy that Blue
  Cash Preferred featuresÂ chip-enabled technology, making it easier to pay for purchases
  outside the U.S. Â International merchants, particularly in Europe, are starting
  to require this technology in order to accept your credit card for payment.Having
  an American Express card also means you get great benefits like extended warranties
  on eligible purchases, purchase protection and return protection. And vacations
  can be easier with car rental loss/damage insurance, travel accident insurance and
  their roadside assistance hotline. Plus you get exclusive access to ticket presales
  and card member-only events.Blue Cash Preferred does charge a $75 annual fee, which
  may seem like a lot but is typically something you can more than make up for through
  the cash back rewards you’ll accrue over the course of the year. If this is something
  you’re not willing to compromise on, its highly-rated sister card might be more
  up your alley. TheÂ Blue Cash Everyday Card from American ExpressÂ doesn’t charge
  any annual fees, features a 15-month 0% APR, and you’ll earn 3% back at US supermarkets,
  2% back as gas stations and select department stores and 1% back on everything else.Although
  earning 6% on groceries and 3% at gas stations and department stores is pretty great,
  if you don’t typically spend much at these places then you are probably better off
  with a card that offers a higher flat rate back on all purchases. Our favorite in
  this category is the Citi Double Cash Card. It features an effective 2% cash back
  on all purchases as well as no annual fee and the ability to get your rewards via
  check or direct deposit. You should also be aware that purchases at warehouses and
  superstores aren’t eligible for the 6% cash back with Blue Cash Preferred. Instead
  you’ll earn the standard 1% cash back, which is still pretty darn good as many cards
  won’t give you any cash back at all for shopping at places likeÂ Costco, Target
  and Walmart. Superstores and warehouses also aren’t eligible for the 3% back on
  gas, you’ll get 1% back there too. If you’re not sure about how this might affect
  you, use our free Cash Back Card Calculator to estimate how much you might earn
  with each of the different cash back cards given your spending patterns.If you enjoy
  traveling outside the U.S., be aware that Blue Cash Preferred charges a 2.7% foreign
  transaction fee. This charge can add up over time, particularly if you’re making
  all your international purchases on the card. If this isn’t something you’re willing
  to consider take a look at the Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards card, which
  doesn’t charge any foreign transaction fees and offers 1.5% cash back on all purchases.The
  cash back rewards for Blue Cash Preferred are very generous, but you aren’t able
  to receive a check or direct deposit to your bank account with the money from your
  rewards. Instead you need toÂ redeem your rewards for a statement credit on your
  account, or for gifts cards and other merchandise. While a statement credit is just
  the same as cash to most people, if you prefer to get cash in your hand, check out
  the aforementioned Citi Double Cash Card, which offers the ability to get your rewards
  via check or direct deposit.Finally, you do need to have excellent credit (often
  considered to be a credit score above 720 but sometimes considered a score over
  750) to be approved for Blue Cash Preferred. If your credit is not quite at that
  level, you should consider one of these cards for less-than-perfect credit.Blue
  Cash Preferred is a terrific card for anyone with excellent credit who wants to
  get big cash back rewards on groceries, gas and purchases at select department stores.
  In fact, the 6% back at supermarkets is the highest rate we’ve seen offered to consumers
  in any category. Plus, you can take advantage of the 15-month 0% APR on balance
  transfers and purchases. It does have an annual fee, and if you shop at superstores
  and warehouse stores you’ll earn the standard 1% instead of the higher cash back
  rates. You also can’t get your rewards in the form of a check or direct deposit
  and it does charge foreign transaction fees. If these are significant factors to
  you, consider some of the options detailed above. Overall though, Blue Cash Preferred
  is our #1 rated cash back card and a great choice for a strong cash back card.Visit

  blue card, are gimmicks and should not be considered seriously by most.  Annual
  fees add to the disincentive.  Sticke with the few cards offering 1 1/2 % and in
  some cases 2% on almost all purchases without fees or limits. 1% airline mile cards
  are no better.  The Fidelity Investments card, available as AMEX or Mastercard,
  through FIA Card Services, is one such card at 2%.When it is 6% on groceries and
  3% on gas… can you buy items at Kroger for 6% cash back, and then turn around and
  buy Kroger gas (because that gives you a discount at the pump) at 3% cash back?
  Or can that apply to gift cards bought at Kroger (which grants 4x reward points)?If
  all of that falls in line, for every $25 you spend at Kroger, you get 6% back, ($1.50)
  then you get 10 cents off on your gas price, with 10 gallons ($1) and 3% back on
  that…Spend $100 at Kroger (6% back is $6), get $1.00 off per gallon of gas. Ten
  gallons at $2.80 goes down to $1.80 (saves $10), spending $18 upon which you get
  3% back, ($0.54) … you’re saving  $16.54. Do that consistently on average for a
  year and you save  just under $200. That excludes using the $100 gift card purchase
  being used for additional 6% or 3% cash back on using it.I have an American Express
  credit card. I have it because it is very generous in providing cash back. However,
  I do not use it for many purchases because of the problems discussed prior to this
  entry. I was offered a Blue Cash card and declined it. I do not wish to pay a credit
  card that requires me to pay a fee for using it. Amex has some good cash back features
  BUT make sure you pay your balance every month when due.Your fee and some of the
  fine print makes it so I will not use AE after Costco Dumps it.ANY CREDIT CARD is
  only good for keeping a record of your spending, and the coinvience of NOT CARRYING
  CASH. And THE ONLY WAY that you can come out “ON TOP”, is IF you PAY YOUR TOTAL
  BALANCE OFF at the end of each month WNEN BILLED. IF you don’t pay your total balance
  at the end of each month, the PERCENTAGE OF PENALITY  YOU WILL BE LIABLE FOR WILL
  “EAT YOU ALIVE”, and CONTINUE TO EAT YOU ALIVE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING MONTHS UNTIL
  YOU HAVE PAID OFF YOUR BALANCE INTO THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH. YOU MUST KNOW
  THIS, AND IF YOU CANNOT PAY OFF YOUR BALANCE “IN FULL” AT THE END OF EACH MONTH,
  THEN YOU SHOULD “RUN FROM OWNING ANY CREDIT CARDS!!!!!!eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!The rebate
  ceiling on AMEX Preferred Blue detracts from its appeal because the hefty fee targets
  the big spenders.  The Fidelity Amex is my go-to card for rewards, but Discover’s
  it Card comes in second.  Discover nominally offers an unlimited 1% rebate, but
  its merchant offers make it easy to get 5%, 10% or much more.  In addition, Discover
  will double your cumulatively  earned rebates over the initial 12 months.  One last
  point: Discover has, by far, the best service of any card; telephone reps are well
  trained, articulate, courteous and all located within the U.S.You would have to
  spend $1250 at a true grocery store (Kroger, Safeway, Albertsons) just for the 6%
  cash back to cover the $75 annual fee, or $2500 at stand-alone gas stations (not
  discount stations like Wal-Mart or Costco). Still, many grocery stores offer lower
  prices than the big discount chains on food so you can save money. Just be careful
  to “fence off” the money you would have spent out of your checking account or paycheck
  so you can pay the credit card bill when it arrives next month.I got this card for
  my day to day use and found it to be very disappointing.  I’m not getting much back,
  their website is annoying, getting the rewards is a special exception, and I never
  got any $150 bonus., also many places don’t take AMEX.  I think this card is just
  good for them.I was really excited about this card since I am not a traveler and
  was looking for a deal on gas and groceries.  I did not know about the grocery limitation
  until just last week.  I do shop for groceries at Walmart more and more.  So those
  purchases make having this card worthless.  It is also worth noting that there are
  restrictions on gas stations as well. Only “stand alone” stations qualify.  I called
  today to get a listing of the gas stations and the person with whom I spoke was
  not clear.  I do not think Von’s or Costco type places qualify.  So you have to
  pay higher prices at name brand gas stations to save.  Go figure.One problem that
  I haven’t seen discussed is that you only get the 6% rebate from “true” grocery
  stores/chains.  However, since I buy most of our groceries at Walmart, I wouldn’t
  get back the promised 6% on grocery purchases.  That’s because most credit cards
  use a code to designate the primary business that is transacted at each store that
  accepts its credit cards.  I have no idea what Walmart’s primary business code is,
  but I’d be surprised if it is groceries.  Therefore, instead of getting back 6%
  on groceries bought at Walmart, as your article espouses, you may get back only
  1%, unless you buy them from a recognized grocery store/chain.  Makes the $75 annual
  fee a waste of money compared to Citibank’s newer Double Cash card which returns
  2% on everything, and has no annual fee.As the former owner of a Car Stereo Shop
  I only put on a sale twice a year. My customers knew that when that time came then
  it was legitimate. I generally held one near Back to school and then at the end
  of January. Back to school to get the teens in to buy and end of January till the
  end of February to lure the Tax refund money as well as to clear out old inventory.
  Small businesses is where you will find “true sales”. Get to know a local shop.
  As for Credit Cards? I took them and added a 6 percent fee. Yes, you the customer
  pays for all transaction fees. So all these cards do is pay you back for what you
  paid us. I would not take Amex at all. Trans fees for merchants makes it not worth
  taking at all. Same with Discover cards.As the former owner of a Car Stereo Shop

  As for Credit Cards?It is sad to see so many people falling for this scam.\nYou
  are the loser no matter how you add it , divide it or multiply it by two. (its a
  saying)\nMerchants add the cost they have to pay to the credit card companies for
  you and me to swipe our debit or credit cards.\nSo we are really getting pennies
  for the dollars we lose every year by allowing the industry to move us from cash
  to credit and debit…because the only winner is the credit card companies…its a genius
  idea and we are sucking it up.Wish I had the time to give you detailed explanation
  of how it all works…but my advice is stop spending…nothing is on special and nothing
  is half off….its all junk that is over priced and to get you to buy it…you need
  to see the red sticker that fools your brain…because this is how you have been trained
  since being a kid.Good luck!This is one example of the rich getting richer cause
  this card is only offered to those with excellent credit.\nHope you can offer this
  card to the middle class with not so excellent credit.If you spend over $2,500/year
  at a qualified grocery store, there is no reason to get the free card: Blue Card
  (no fee): $2,500*.03 = $75\nBlue Preferred Card (w/$75 fee): $2,500*.06-$75 = $75I
  never though that I would buy into a credit card with a fee. However, this is by
  far the best credit card I ever had. I use this card with the no fee Amazon Visa
  (3% on Amazon purchases, 2% at restaurants and pharmacies, 1% everything else.)Fidelity
  Amex  gives you 2% on all purchases with no limit.  We do that for all we can charge
  and it usually allows us to buy a ticket to go wherever we want with no airline
  hassel. THERE IS NO ANNUAL CHARGE just have a Fidelity account.And as a business
  owner this is why I don’t take AMX  at ALL !! Guess who pays for the 6% it sure
  isn’t AMX !!!Ray, the first post here and guy without a PHD must be wrong on his
  calculations. Spending $15,000 annually there is NO WAY he can accumulate more than
  $3000 in cashback. That would be over 20%. He must have pushed the wrong buttons
  on his calculator or forgot to use the right decimal. Maybe $300, but no way $3,000.I
  used the calculator and for spending 15k a year it shows i would get over 3k per
  year cashback. While I don’t have my PHD in math I am fairly certain that there
  is no way the calculations on that screen are accurate. Does anyone even try this
  stuff out before putting it online?Thank You SO much for all of this info.  I only
  have a bank debit card and did not know of all these cards that offered cash back.\nOne
  problem, my cred is not excellent only good. What card would I be eligible for,
  if any?\nThanks again,\nJane LocklearI get 7% off on groceries! I use my Citi Double
  Cashback card to get 2% and shop only on senior Wednesdays to get another 5% from
  my local Kroger and/or Publix./the rewards or cash back that you earn is actually
  paid for by the business owner where you used the card.  It occurs through a higher
  fee  charged to the business to process the cardThe Sam’s Club credit card (not
  the membership card) has a 5% cash back on gasoline purchases from any station.If
  you look at it that you get 3% off groc. with the free card it would take longer
  to recoup your $75 annual fee.  I do use the free Am Ex for all the groc. I can
  but my go-to store is Aldi’s for  the best price.  Aldi’s does not take any charge
  cards – just debit/cash etc.\nI have the Sam’s card too for the 5% back on gas and
  3% on travel.  I have 2 cards with the rotating catagories – Chase Freedom and Discover
  It. so the quarter they are giving 5% back in a catagory I use that particular card.
  \ I like the restaurant 5% quarters and Home Improvement stores 5%.  Currently Discover
  is offering 5% back for amazon.com, clothing and dept. stores which is good for
  the Christmas buying season.  I just don’t like the idea of paying $75 to have any
  card when the others are all free.  I also use a AARP Chase card for restaurants
  which is 3% off if there is no better deal @ Discover or Chase Freedom.  I love
  the free reward $ and/or gift cards.I just took your advice, applied online and
  was approved right away. I’m even doing a balance transfer to save even more money!
  Thanks for much for the info!!I absolutely love this card. When you add the benefits
  and rewards you get, the card pays for itself. I started off with the no annual
  fee cash card from AMEX & soon upgraded to the AMEX preferred when I realized just
  how much more my rewards would be with this card. I spend over $500. monthly on
  groceries, even more holiday months and so the rewards have really added. Like to
  use the card for gas too. Right now I have over $450. in cash rewards which I will
  use to purchase gift cards this Xmas season. I highly recommend this card . My only
  advise is to do as I do, pay your bill off monthly so that it is interest free and
  the only one earning is you. Love my card!I am about to cancel my membership and
  give myself  $75 back to me. Sams club MC rebates 5% on Gas, 3% on travel and restaurants
  and 1% on rest. Citi double rewards is 2% on all purchases. Both these cards are
  free of fees. Of course one needs to be Sams member.I buy most of my groceries at
  Costco where most items are already discounted more that the 6%.  After April you’ll
  need a Citibank Visa card there which will provide a 1 or 2% additional rebate,
  depending on your membership status.  They’ll also match the current 3% rebate at
  all gas stations.  This one doesn’t sound like the one for me.  Look into the Am
  ex solid blue card with no annual fee as a good partner to the new Costco Visa.Too
  bad the yearly fee is so high AND that so few places accept American Express–at
  least from my past experiences with AE. I refuse to pay a fee to be eligible for
  cash-back.You must spend $1250 on groceries or $2500 on gas (75/.06 and 75/.03)
  \ just to break even with the $75 annual fee. $1875 and $7500 before you break even
  on a regular 2% back on everything card.I have had this card for 3 years and it
  is great.  Like with every other card, it gets paid off every month, so there is
  no interest charges.  And between me and my roommate, we easily spend right at $500
  per month at the grocery store and then gas, with the strict rule, those are the
  only two places the card goes.  It’s like getting a 6% discount on our grocery bill.
  \ Can’t beat it! I haven’t tried it yet, but if you throw some coupons on top of
  that, you could save some serious cash.And this is why I don’t accept Amex at my
  businessI really hate these cards that offer different rates. I have a Capital One
  that gives me 2% on everything. I don’t have to remember what works for more points.
  And it was great fun paying for $25,000 of my new truck on the card.debt free more
  moneyIf Walmart and BJ’s and Sam’s Club stores are not considered grocery stores
  it could be an issue with the Amex card. But if you spend $5000 at a regular grocery
  store a year around $400 a month it would still be $300 of the Amex Card rebate.
  Figure in $1500 for gasoline and that is another  $45 rebate. Still seems worthwhile
  almost like free money.I have never come across a mortgage that you can pay with
  credit carddfhSounds good but how long would it take an average person to spend
  enough to get the $75 fee back?I want to know more about the cute redhead.I have
  this card – thought what a great deal as much groceries that I buy.  Doesn’t count
  as groceries at Wal-Mart or any grocery store that sells merchandise too.  Still
  get 1%, but not 3% or 6%.  For the most part I have only been getting 1% for everywhere
  that I shop  around my area.I have this card – thought what a great deal as much

  card only at grocery stores until I hit $6,000. That’s $360. I’ll take $285 after
  the fee! I use my Cap One Venture card for everything else (and grocery stores after
  my $6,000 limit) to get 2% on all of that. You CAN use it at Kroger for the 6% cash
  back, so I use it to buy gift cards there for other stores. That gives me both double
  fuel points and the 6% cash back.\nAs far as keeping track of spending, the online
  system automatically does that for you when you sign in to your account. I see no
  reason why you wouldn’t want this card, especially if you are buying groceries (and
  gift cards) for 2 or more people throughout the year. A single person who doesn’t
  do much grocery shopping likely wouldn’t benefit much, but for the right situation

  $22,600 for other using my Discover card.  This Amex card would have given me a
  total reward of $586 at a cost of $150.  The net reward — with the strict limits
  on what it could be used for — would have been equal to 1.6%.  But a while back
  I switched to Cap One and get 1.5% on everything.  Amex may be a useful card for

  give you 1% back at the grocery stores where most of us shop, like Walmart,  Kroger,
  and Meijers. When I called American express to ask why I only received 1% instead
  of 3% at Meijers, Kroger etc. they told me those stores are not true grocery stores.

  on the old Blue Cash which gives an unlimited 5% on groceries after spending a total

  2% back on everything no matter what you spend the money on.  The only caveat is
  that they do it in points, and you have to go online and apply the points to remove

  1% cash-back except for special promotions, I recommend the no-annual-fee American

  AmEx Blue Cash Preferred Card gives you 3% more for groceries (6%) and 1% more for

  records – as well as seeing the cash-back totals build.  The Preferred Card’s not
  adding up for me because I don’t shop for enough in standalone supermarkets.\nWhen
  Nov. (and my next $75-annual-fee) approaches, I’m going to switch to the no-annual

  that Chase Freedom Visa gives 5% cash-back for groceries from Jan-Mar and Bank of

  Express, don’t you? It is simply taken directly from the merchants, more often than
  not small, Mom and Pop stores, who are given no choice in the matter. American Express
  and other card companies deduct that money from the merchant and then take the credit
  for generously giving it back to the purchaser. Of course they also skim a healthy
  amount off the top as well. So the naive consumer eagerly embraces the fairy tale
  idea of getting “cash back” (by paying more for his purchase), instead of realizing
  that the merchant would much rather discount the price to the buyer directly.You

  in November 2014, but only because there was a $150 bonus if I charged $1000 with
  it in 90 days, which was subtracted from my card balance as soon as I achieved it.
  \ That paid for two years worth of $75 fees and gave me time to evaluate it without
  cost.  It’s not looking like a keeper!\nIt may not be worth that $75/yr compared
  to the similar no-annual-fee American Express Blue Cash Everyday card – and I’m
  considering switching over to it before my 2nd year’s $75 annual fee comes up in
  November 2015: as of March 9, 2015, after nearly 4 months with the card, I’ve only
  built up $23.61 in cash-back (not counting that $100 one-time bonus), $10.56 is
  due to 1% cash-back for a $1056 charge that I would have gotten the same back with
  any of my no-annual-fee cards.The big deals with the Preferred card are 6% cash-back
  for standalone supermarkets vs 3% for the Everyday card (both do only 1% at Walmart,
  Costco, etc.), 3% cash-back at standalone gas stations for Preferred vs 2% for Everyday,
  and special permanent or time-limited online deals for Preferred like “spend $25
  at  Papa Johns and get $5 cash-back.”  Both cards give at least 1% cash-back on
  all purchases.Preferred may not work well if you buy most of your groceries at places
  like Costco, Target, Walmart and Sam’s Club – and I’ve been averaging 6.74% off
  with Walmart’s “Savings Catcher” combined with their no-fee Bluebird card and all
  my no-annual-fee cards do 1% cash-back at Walmart on top of it.  Most of the special
  offers aren’t bargains and apply to above-average cost stores like Whole Foods.\nTwo
  of my cards give 5% cash-back six months of the year for standalone gas stations
  (though you have to sign-up for the programs on your card’s webpage): Discover Card
  (Jan-Mar) and Chase Freedom Visa (July-Sept) so the Preferred card is basically
  good for me for a minority of my groceries and 6 months of gasoline.  Since I may
  get the Bank of America Cash Rewards Mastercard, which does 3% cash-back for gasoline,
  that means the Preferred’s 6% or Everyday’s 3% off for standalone supermarkets are
  my main reasons for using them.  The only other no-annual-fee card besides Everyday
  that gives more than 1% off supermarkets is that B of A Cash Rewards Mastercard
  which gives 2%, so Everyday would be my card of choice in supermarkets, where I

  Louie the cash comes from money you are forced to overpay when you use the credit
  card.  Oddly charges are called discount points.  imagine how much the bank is charging
  the merchant ever time you use that card if they can still afford to give you 6%
  back.  Now imagine how much less ever thing would be if “nobody” used plastic and
  paid only cash.  Of course the government hates this because there is no way to
  track cash spending.yes Louie the cash comes from money you are forced to overpay

  companies whose products and services we review. For credit cards, we review cards
  from all of the top 10 US issuers by purchase volume (according to Issue 1035 of
  The Nilson Report, Feb 2014) excluding issuers that require additional accounts
  to be a cardholder and private label issuers. We may also review cards from other
  issuers in select cases. We do not review all products in a given category. We are
