        The modern field of linguistics dates from the beginning of the 19th century. While ancient India and Greece had a remarkable grammatical tradition, throughout most of history linguistics had been the province of philosophy, rhetoric, and literary analysis to try to figure out how human language works. But in 1786, an amazing discovery was made: There are regular sound correspondences among many of the languages spoken in Europe, India, and Persia. For example, the English 'f' sound often corresponds to a 'p' sound in, among others, Latin and Sanskrit, an important ancient language of India:
- |
  ENGLISHLATINSANSKRITfatherpaterpitarfullplenuspurnasforperpari
- |
  Scholars realized that these correspondences—found in thousands of words—could not be due to chance or to mutual influence. The only reliable conclusion was that these languages are related to one another because they come from a common ancestor. Much of 19th century linguistics was devoted to working out the nature of this parent language, spoken about 6,000 years ago, as well as the changes by which 'Proto-Indo-European', as we now call it, developed into English, Russian, Hindi, and its other modern descendants.
- |
  This program of historical linguistics continues today. Linguists have succeeded in grouping the 5,000 or so languages of the world into a number of language families sharing a common ancestor.
- |
  The Study of Language Structure
- |
  At the beginning of the 20th century, attention shifted to the fact that not only language change, but language structure as well, is systematic and governed by regular rules and principles. The attention of the world's linguists turned more and more to the study of grammar—in the technical sense of the term the organization of the sound system of a language and the internal structure of its words and sentences. By the 1920s, the program of 'structural linguistics', inspired in large part by the ideas of the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, was developing sophisticated methods of grammatical analysis. This period also saw an intensified scholarly study of languages that had never been written down. It had by then become commonplace, for example, for an American linguist to spend several years working out the intricacies of the grammars of Chippewa, Ojibwa, Apache, Mohawk, or some other indigenous language of North America.
- |
  The last half-century has seen a deepening of understanding of these rules and principles and the growth of a widespread conviction that despite their seeming diversity, all the languages of the world are basically cut from the same cloth. As grammatical analysis has become deeper, we have found more fundamental commonalities among the languages of the world. The program initiated by the linguist Noam Chomsky in 1957 sees this fact as a consequence of the human brain being 'prewired' for particular properties of grammar, thereby drastically limiting the number of possible human languages. The claims of this program have been the basis for a great deal of recent linguistic research, and have been one of the most important centers of controversy in the field. Books and journal articles routinely present evidence for or against the idea that central properties of language are innate.
- |
  Language Use: Studies of Meaning
- |
  There is also a long tradition in the study of what it means to say that a word or sentence 'means' a particular thing and how these meanings are conveyed when we communicate with each other. Two popular ideas about what meanings are go back to the ancient Greeks: One is that meanings are mental representations of some sort; another is that the meaning of an expression is purely a function of how it is used. Both ideas have launched research programs that are active today. They have been joined by a third approach, building on work by philosophers such as Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell, which applies formal methods derived from logic and attempts to equate the meaning of an expression with reference and the conditions under which it might be judged to be true or false. Other linguists have been looking at the cognitive principles underlying the organization of meaning, including the basic metaphoric processes that some claim to see at the heart of grammar. And still others have been examining the ways that sentences are tied together to form coherent discourse.
- |
  Language Use: The Social Side of Language
- |
  In the past 50 years, there has been increasing attention to the social side of language as well as the mental. The subfield of sociolinguistics has come of age in part as a consequence of post World War II social movements. The national liberation movements active in third world countries after the war posed the question of what would be their official language(s) after independence, a pressing question, since almost all of them are multilingual. This led to scholarly study of the language situation in the countries of the world. In addition, the movements for minority rights in the United States and other Western countries has led to a close examination of social variation that complements earlier work in geographical variation. Scholars have turned the analytical tools of linguistics to the study of nonstandard varieties like African American Vernacular English and Chicano Spanish. And the women's movement has led many linguists to investigate gender differences in speech and whether our language has to perpetuate sexual inequality.

  linguistics dates from the beginning of the 19th century. While ancient India and
  Greece had a remarkable grammatical tradition, throughout most of history linguistics
  had been the province of philosophy, rhetoric, and literary analysis to try to figure
  out how human language works. But in 1786, an amazing discovery was made: There
  are regular sound correspondences among many of the languages spoken in Europe,
  India, and Persia. For example, the English 'f' sound often corresponds to a 'p'
  sound in, among others, Latin and Sanskrit, an important ancient language of India:\nENGLISHLATINSANSKRITfatherpaterpitarfullplenuspurnasforperpari\nScholars
  realized that these correspondences—found in thousands of words—could not be due
  to chance or to mutual influence. The only reliable conclusion was that these languages
  are related to one another because they come from a common ancestor. Much of 19th
  century linguistics was devoted to working out the nature of this parent language,
  spoken about 6,000 years ago, as well as the changes by which 'Proto-Indo-European',
  as we now call it, developed into English, Russian, Hindi, and its other modern
  descendants.\nThis program of historical linguistics continues today. Linguists
  have succeeded in grouping the 5,000 or so languages of the world into a number
  of language families sharing a common ancestor.\nThe Study of Language Structure\nAt
  the beginning of the 20th century, attention shifted to the fact that not only language
  change, but language structure as well, is systematic and governed by regular rules
  and principles. The attention of the world's linguists turned more and more to the
  study of grammar—in the technical sense of the term the organization of the sound
  system of a language and the internal structure of its words and sentences. By the
  1920s, the program of 'structural linguistics', inspired in large part by the ideas
  of the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, was developing sophisticated methods
  of grammatical analysis. This period also saw an intensified scholarly study of
  languages that had never been written down. It had by then become commonplace, for
  example, for an American linguist to spend several years working out the intricacies
  of the grammars of Chippewa, Ojibwa, Apache, Mohawk, or some other indigenous language
  of North America.\nThe last half-century has seen a deepening of understanding of
  these rules and principles and the growth of a widespread conviction that despite
  their seeming diversity, all the languages of the world are basically cut from the
  same cloth. As grammatical analysis has become deeper, we have found more fundamental
  commonalities among the languages of the world. The program initiated by the linguist
  Noam Chomsky in 1957 sees this fact as a consequence of the human brain being 'prewired'
  for particular properties of grammar, thereby drastically limiting the number of
  possible human languages. The claims of this program have been the basis for a great
  deal of recent linguistic research, and have been one of the most important centers
  of controversy in the field. Books and journal articles routinely present evidence
  for or against the idea that central properties of language are innate.\nLanguage
  Use: Studies of Meaning\nThere is also a long tradition in the study of what it
  means to say that a word or sentence 'means' a particular thing and how these meanings
  are conveyed when we communicate with each other. Two popular ideas about what meanings
  are go back to the ancient Greeks: One is that meanings are mental representations
  of some sort; another is that the meaning of an expression is purely a function
  of how it is used. Both ideas have launched research programs that are active today.
  They have been joined by a third approach, building on work by philosophers such
  as Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell, which applies formal methods derived from
  logic and attempts to equate the meaning of an expression with reference and the
  conditions under which it might be judged to be true or false. Other linguists have
  been looking at the cognitive principles underlying the organization of meaning,
  including the basic metaphoric processes that some claim to see at the heart of
  grammar. And still others have been examining the ways that sentences are tied together
  to form coherent discourse.\nLanguage Use: The Social Side of Language\nIn the past
  50 years, there has been increasing attention to the social side of language as
  well as the mental. The subfield of sociolinguistics has come of age in part as
  a consequence of post World War II social movements. The national liberation movements
  active in third world countries after the war posed the question of what would be
  their official language(s) after independence, a pressing question, since almost
  all of them are multilingual. This led to scholarly study of the language situation
  in the countries of the world. In addition, the movements for minority rights in
  the United States and other Western countries has led to a close examination of
  social variation that complements earlier work in geographical variation. Scholars
  have turned the analytical tools of linguistics to the study of nonstandard varieties
  like African American Vernacular English and Chicano Spanish. And the women's movement
  has led many linguists to investigate gender differences in speech and whether our
  language has to perpetuate sexual inequality.\nby Frederick J. Newmeyer\nSuggested
