   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
- |2
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
- |2+

- |
  0. PREAMBLE
- |2+

- |
  The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
- |
  functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
- |
  assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
- |
  with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
- |
  Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
- |
  to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
- |
  for modifications made by others.
- |2+

- |
  This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
- |
  works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
- |
  complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
- |
  license designed for free software.
- |2+

- |
  We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
- |
  software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
- |
  program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
- |
  software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
- |
  it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
- |
  whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
- |
  principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
- |2+

- |
  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
- |2+

- |
  This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
- |
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
- |
  distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
- |
  world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
- |
  work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
- |
  refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
- |
  licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
- |
  copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
- |
  under copyright law.
- |2+

- |
  A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
- |
  Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
- |
  modifications and/or translated into another language.
- |2+

- |
  A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
- |
  the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
- |
  publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
- |
  subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
- |
  directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
- |
  part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
- |
  any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
- |
  connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
- |
  commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
- |
  them.
- |2+

- |
  The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
- |
  are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
- |
  that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
- |
  section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
- |
  allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
- |
  Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
- |
  Sections then there are none.
- |2+

- |
  The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
- |
  as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
- |
  the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
- |
  be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
- |2+

- |
  A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
- |
  represented in a format whose specification is available to the
- |
  general public, that is suitable for revising the document
- |
  straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
- |
  pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
- |
  drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
- |
  for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
- |
  to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
- |
  format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
- |
  or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
- |
  An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
- |
  of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
- |2+

- |
  Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
- |
  ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
- |
  or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
- |
  HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
- |
  transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
- |
  include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
- |
  proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
- |
  processing tools are not generally available, and the
- |
  machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
- |
  processors for output purposes only.
- |2+

- |
  The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
- |
  plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
- |
  this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
- |
  formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
- |
  the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
- |
  preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
- |2+

- |
  The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
- |
  the Document to the public.
- |2+

- |
  A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
- |
  title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
- |
  text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
- |
  specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
- |
  "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
- |
  of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
- |
  section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
- |2+

- |
  The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
- |
  states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
- |
  Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
- |
  License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
- |
  implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
- |
  no effect on the meaning of this License.
- |2+

- |
  2. VERBATIM COPYING
- |2+

- |
  You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
- |
  commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
- |
  copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
- |
  to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
- |
  other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
- |
  technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
- |
  copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
- |
  compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
- |
  number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
- |2+

- |
  You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
- |
  you may publicly display copies.
- |2+

- |
  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
- |2+

- |
  If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
- |
  printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
- |
  Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
- |
  copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
- |
  Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
- |
  the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
- |
  you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
- |
  the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
- |
  visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
- |
  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
- |
  the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
- |
  as verbatim copying in other respects.
- |2+

- |
  If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
- |
  legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
- |
  reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
- |
  pages.
- |2+

- |
  If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
- |
  more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
- |
  copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
- |
  a computer-network location from which the general network-using
- |
  public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
- |
  a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
- |
  If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
- |
  when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
- |
  that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
- |
  location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
- |
  Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
- |
  edition to the public.
- |2+

- |
  It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
- |
  Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
- |
  give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
- |
  Document.
- |2+

- |
  4. MODIFICATIONS
- |2+

- |
  You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
- |
  the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
- |
  the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
- |
  Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
- |
  and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
- |
  of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
- |2+

- |
  A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
- |2
     from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
- |2
     (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
- |2
     of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
- |2
     if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
- |2
     responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
- |2
     Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
- |2
     Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
- |2
     unless they release you from this requirement.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
- |2
     Modified Version, as the publisher.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
- |2
     adjacent to the other copyright notices.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
- |2
     giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
- |2
     terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
- |2
     and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
- |2
     to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
- |2
     publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
- |2
     there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
- |2
     stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
- |2
     given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
- |2
     Version as stated in the previous sentence.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
- |2
     public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
- |2
     the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
- |2
     it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
- |2
     You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
- |2
     least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
- |2
     publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
- |2
     Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
- |2
     the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
- |2
     and/or dedications given therein.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
- |2
     unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
- |2
     or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
- |2
     may not be included in the Modified Version.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
- |2
     or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
- |2+

- |
  If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
- |
  appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
- |
  copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
- |
  of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
- |
  list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
- |
  These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
- |2+

- |
  You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
- |
  nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
- |
  parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
- |
  been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
- |
  standard.
- |2+

- |
  You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
- |
  passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
- |
  of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
- |
  Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
- |
  through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
- |
  includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
- |
  by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
- |
  you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
- |
  permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
- |2+

- |
  The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
- |
  give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
- |
  imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
- |2+

- |
  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
- |2+

- |
  You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
- |
  License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
- |
  versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
- |
  Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
- |
  list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
- |
  license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
- |2+

- |
  The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
- |
  multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
- |
  copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
- |
  different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
- |
  adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
- |
  author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
- |
  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
- |
  Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
- |2+

- |
  In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
- |
  in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
- |
  "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
- |
  and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
- |
  Entitled "Endorsements".
- |2+

- |
  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
- |2+

- |
  You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
- |
  documents released under this License, and replace the individual
- |
  copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
- |
  that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
- |
  of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
- |
  other respects.
- |2+

- |
  You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
- |
  distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
- |
  copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
- |
  License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
- |
  document.
- |2+

- |
  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
- |2+

- |
  A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
- |
  and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
- |
  distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
- |
  resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
- |
  of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
- |
  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
- |
  apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
- |
  derivative works of the Document.
- |2+

- |
  If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
- |
  copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
- |
  the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
- |
  covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
- |
  electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
- |
  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
- |
  aggregate.
- |2+

- |
  8. TRANSLATION
- |2+

- |
  Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
- |
  distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
- |
  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
- |
  permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
- |
  translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
- |
  original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
- |
  translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
- |
  Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
- |
  the original English version of this License and the original versions
- |
  of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
- |
  the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
- |
  or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
- |2+

- |
  If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
- |
  "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
- |
  its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
- |
  title.
- |2+

- |
  9. TERMINATION
- |2+

- |
  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
- |
  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
- |
  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
- |
  will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
- |2+

- |
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
- |
  from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
- |
  unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
- |
  terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
- |
  fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
- |
  60 days after the cessation.
- |2+

- |
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
- |
  reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
- |
  violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
- |
  received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
- |
  copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
- |
  your receipt of the notice.
- |2+

- |
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
- |
  licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
- |
  this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
- |
  reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
- |
  not give you any rights to use it.
- |2+

- |
  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
- |2+

- |
  The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
- |
  GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
- |
  will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
- |
  detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
- |
  http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
- |2+

- |
  Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
- |
  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
- |
  License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
- |
  following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
- |
  of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
- |
  Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
- |
  number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
- |
  as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
- |
  specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
- |
  License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
- |
  version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
- |
  Document.
- |2+

- |
  11. RELICENSING
- |2+

- |
  "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
- |
  World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
- |
  provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
- |
  public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
- |
  "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
- |
  means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.
- |2+

- "\"CC-BY-SA\" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 \n"
- "license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit \n"
- "corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, \n"
- "California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license \n"
- |
  published by that same organization.
- |2+

- "\"Incorporate\" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in \n"
- |
  part, as part of another Document.
- |2+

- "An MMC is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this \n"
- "License, and if all works that were first published under this License \n"
- "somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or \n"
- "in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and \n"
- |
  (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
- |2+

- |
  The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
- |
  under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
- |
  provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
- |2+

- |
  ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
- |2+

- |
  To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
- |
  the License in the document and put the following copyright and
- |
  license notices just after the title page:
- |2+

- |2
      Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
- |2
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
- |2
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
- |2
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
- |2
      with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
- |2
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
- |2
      Free Documentation License".
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
- |
  replace the "with … Texts." line with this:
- |2+

- |2
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
- |2
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
- |
  combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
- |
  situation.
- |2+

- |
  If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
- |
  recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
- |
  free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
- |
  to permit their use in free software.

   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
- |2
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
- |
  functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
- |
  assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
- |
  with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
- |
  Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
- |
  to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
- |
  for modifications made by others.This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
- |
  works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
- |
  complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
- |
  license designed for free software.We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
- |
  software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
- |
  program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
- |
  software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
- |
  it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
- |
  whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
- |
  principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
- |
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
- |
  distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
- |
  world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
- |
  work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
- |
  refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
- |
  licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
- |
  copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
- |
  under copyright law.A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
- |
  Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
- |
  modifications and/or translated into another language.A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
- |
  the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
- |
  publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
- |
  subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
- |
  directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
- |
  part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
- |
  any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
- |
  connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
- |
  commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
- |
  them.The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
- |
  are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
- |
  that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
- |
  section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
- |
  allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
- |
  Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
- |
  Sections then there are none.The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
- |
  as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
- |
  the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
- |
  be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
- |
  represented in a format whose specification is available to the
- |
  general public, that is suitable for revising the document
- |
  straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
- |
  pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
- |
  drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
- |
  for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
- |
  to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
- |
  format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
- |
  or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
- |
  An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
- |
  of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
- |
  ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
- |
  or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
- |
  HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
- |
  transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
- |
  include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
- |
  proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
- |
  processing tools are not generally available, and the
- |
  machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
- |
  processors for output purposes only.The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
- |
  plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
- |
  this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
- |
  formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
- |
  the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
- |
  preceding the beginning of the body of the text.The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
- |
  the Document to the public.A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
- |
  title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
- |
  text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
- |
  specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
- |
  "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
- |
  of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
- |
  section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
- |
  states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
- |
  Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
- |
  License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
- |
  implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
- |
  no effect on the meaning of this License.You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
- |
  commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
- |
  copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
- |
  to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
- |
  other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
- |
  technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
- |
  copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
- |
  compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
- |
  number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
- |
  you may publicly display copies.If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
- |
  printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
- |
  Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
- |
  copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
- |
  Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
- |
  the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
- |
  you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
- |
  the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
- |
  visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
- |
  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
- |
  the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
- |
  as verbatim copying in other respects.If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
- |
  legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
- |
  reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
- |
  pages.If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
- |
  more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
- |
  copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
- |
  a computer-network location from which the general network-using
- |
  public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
- |
  a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
- |
  If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
- |
  when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
- |
  that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
- |
  location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
- |
  Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
- |
  edition to the public.It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
- |
  Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
- |
  give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
- |
  Document.You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
- |
  the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
- |
  the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
- |
  Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
- |
  and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
- |
  of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
- |
  appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
- |
  copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
- |
  of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
- |
  list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
- |
  These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
- |
  nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
- |
  parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
- |
  been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
- |
  standard.You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
- |
  passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
- |
  of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
- |
  Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
- |
  through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
- |
  includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
- |
  by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
- |
  you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
- |
  permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
- |
  give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
- |
  imply endorsement of any Modified Version.You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
- |
  License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
- |
  versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
- |
  Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
- |
  list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
- |
  license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
- |
  multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
- |
  copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
- |
  different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
- |
  adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
- |
  author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
- |
  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
- |
  Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
- |
  in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
- |
  "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
- |
  and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
- |
  Entitled "Endorsements".You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
- |
  documents released under this License, and replace the individual
- |
  copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
- |
  that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
- |
  of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
- |
  other respects.You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
- |
  distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
- |
  copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
- |
  License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
- |
  document.A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
- |
  and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
- |
  distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
- |
  resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
- |
  of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
- |
  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
- |
  apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
- |
  derivative works of the Document.If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
- |
  copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
- |
  the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
- |
  covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
- |
  electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
- |
  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
- |
  aggregate.Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
- |
  distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
- |
  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
- |
  permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
- |
  translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
- |
  original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
- |
  translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
- |
  Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
- |
  the original English version of this License and the original versions
- |
  of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
- |
  the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
- |
  or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
- |
  "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
- |
  its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
- |
  title.You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
- |
  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
- |
  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
- |
  will automatically terminate your rights under this License.However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
- |
  from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
- |
  unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
- |
  terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
- |
  fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
- |
  60 days after the cessation.Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
- |
  reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
- |
  violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
- |
  received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
- |
  copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
- |
  your receipt of the notice.Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
- |
  licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
- |
  this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
- |
  reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
- |
  not give you any rights to use it.The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
- |
  GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
- |
  will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
- |
  detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
- |
  http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
- |
  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
- |
  License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
- |
  following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
- |
  of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
- |
  Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
- |
  number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
- |
  as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
- |
  specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
- |
  License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a

  3 November 2008\n\n Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation,
  Inc.\n     <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
  copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n0. PREAMBLE\n\nThe
  purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\nfunctional and
  useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to\nassure everyone the effective
  freedom to copy and redistribute it,\nwith or without modifying it, either commercially
  or noncommercially.\nSecondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher
  a way\nto get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible\nfor
  modifications made by others.\n\nThis License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means
  that derivative\nworks of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
  \ It\ncomplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\nlicense designed
  for free software.\n\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
  for free\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free\nprogram
  should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\nsoftware does.  But
  this License is not limited to software manuals;\nit can be used for any textual
  work, regardless of subject matter or\nwhether it is published as a printed book.
  \ We recommend this License\nprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction
  or reference.\n\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\nThis License applies to any
  manual or other work, in any medium, that\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright
  holder saying it can be\ndistributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
  grants a\nworld-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that\nwork
  under the conditions stated herein.  The \"Document\", below,\nrefers to any such
  manual or work.  Any member of the public is a\nlicensee, and is addressed as \"you\".
  \ You accept the license if you\ncopy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring
  permission\nunder copyright law.\n\nA \"Modified Version\" of the Document means
  any work containing the\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or
  with\nmodifications and/or translated into another language.\n\nA \"Secondary Section\"
  is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\nthe Document that deals exclusively
  with the relationship of the\npublishers or authors of the Document to the Document's
  overall\nsubject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall\ndirectly
  within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in\npart a textbook of mathematics,
  a Secondary Section may not explain\nany mathematics.)  The relationship could be
  a matter of historical\nconnection with the subject or with related matters, or
  of legal,\ncommercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\nthem.\n\nThe
  \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\nare designated,
  as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\nthat says that the Document
  is released under this License.  If a\nsection does not fit the above definition
  of Secondary then it is not\nallowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document
  may contain zero\nInvariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant\nSections
  then there are none.\n\nThe \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that
  are listed,\nas Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\nthe
  Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may\nbe at most 5 words,
  and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n\nA \"Transparent\" copy of the
  Document means a machine-readable copy,\nrepresented in a format whose specification
  is available to the\ngeneral public, that is suitable for revising the document\nstraightforwardly
  with generic text editors or (for images composed of\npixels) generic paint programs
  or (for drawings) some widely available\ndrawing editor, and that is suitable for
  input to text formatters or\nfor automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable
  for input\nto text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\nformat
  whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart\nor discourage subsequent
  modification by readers is not Transparent.\nAn image format is not Transparent
  if used for any substantial amount\nof text.  A copy that is not \"Transparent\"
  is called \"Opaque\".\n\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
  plain\nASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML\nor
  XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple\nHTML, PostScript
  or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of\ntransparent image formats
  include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats\ninclude proprietary formats that can
  be read and edited only by\nproprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the
  DTD and/or\nprocessing tools are not generally available, and the\nmachine-generated
  HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word\nprocessors for output purposes only.\n\nThe
  \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\nplus such following
  pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\nthis License requires to appear
  in the title page.  For works in\nformats which do not have any title page as such,
  \"Title Page\" means\nthe text near the most prominent appearance of the work's
  title,\npreceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n\nThe \"publisher\" means
  any person or entity that distributes copies of\nthe Document to the public.\n\nA
  section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose\ntitle either
  is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\ntext that translates
  XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a\nspecific section name mentioned
  below, such as \"Acknowledgements\",\n\"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".)
  \ To \"Preserve the Title\"\nof such a section when you modify the Document means
  that it remains a\nsection \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.\n\nThe
  Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which\nstates that
  this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty\nDisclaimers are considered
  to be included by reference in this\nLicense, but only as regards disclaiming warranties:
  any other\nimplication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has\nno
  effect on the meaning of this License.\n\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\n\nYou may copy and
  distribute the Document in any medium, either\ncommercially or noncommercially,
  provided that this License, the\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying
  this License applies\nto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
  add no\nother conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\ntechnical
  measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\ncopying of the copies you
  make or distribute.  However, you may accept\ncompensation in exchange for copies.
  \ If you distribute a large enough\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions
  in section 3.\n\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
  and\nyou may publicly display copies.\n\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n\nIf you publish
  printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have\nprinted covers) of the Document,
  numbering more than 100, and the\nDocument's license notice requires Cover Texts,
  you must enclose the\ncopies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these
  Cover\nTexts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\nthe
  back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\nyou as the publisher
  of these copies.  The front cover must present\nthe full title with all words of
  the title equally prominent and\nvisible.  You may add other material on the covers
  in addition.\nCopying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\nthe
  title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\nas verbatim
  copying in other respects.\n\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous
  to fit\nlegibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\nreasonably)
  on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\npages.\n\nIf you publish
  or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\nmore than 100, you must either
  include a machine-readable Transparent\ncopy along with each Opaque copy, or state
  in or with each Opaque copy\na computer-network location from which the general
  network-using\npublic has access to download using public-standard network protocols\na
  complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.\nIf you use the
  latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,\nwhen you begin distribution
  of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure\nthat this Transparent copy will remain
  thus accessible at the stated\nlocation until at least one year after the last time
  you distribute an\nOpaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of
  that\nedition to the public.\n\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact
  the authors of the\nDocument well before redistributing any large number of copies,
  to\ngive them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the\nDocument.\n\n4.
  MODIFICATIONS\n\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
  under\nthe conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\nthe
  Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\nVersion filling
  the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\nand modification of the Modified
  Version to whoever possesses a copy\nof it.  In addition, you must do these things
  in the Modified Version:\n\nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any)
  a title distinct\n   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\n
  \  (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\n   of the
  Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\n   if the original
  publisher of that version gives permission.\n\n\nB. List on the Title Page, as authors,
  one or more persons or entities\n   responsible for authorship of the modifications
  in the Modified\n   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors
  of the\n   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),\n
  \  unless they release you from this requirement.\n\n\nC. State on the Title page
  the name of the publisher of the\n   Modified Version, as the publisher.\n\n\nD.
  Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n\n\nE. Add an appropriate copyright
  notice for your modifications\n   adjacent to the other copyright notices.\n\n\nF.
  Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\n   giving the
  public permission to use the Modified Version under the\n   terms of this License,
  in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n\n\nG. Preserve in that license notice
  the full lists of Invariant Sections\n   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
  license notice.\n\n\nH. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\n\n\nI. Preserve
  the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add\n   to it an item
  stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\n   publisher of the Modified
  Version as given on the Title Page.  If\n   there is no section Entitled \"History\"
  in the Document, create one\n   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher
  of the Document as\n   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the
  Modified\n   Version as stated in the previous sentence.\n\n\nJ. Preserve the network
  location, if any, given in the Document for\n   public access to a Transparent copy
  of the Document, and likewise\n   the network locations given in the Document for
  previous versions\n   it was based on.  These may be placed in the \"History\" section.\n
  \  You may omit a network location for a work that was published at\n   least four
  years before the Document itself, or if the original\n   publisher of the version
  it refers to gives permission.\n\n\nK. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\"
  or \"Dedications\",\n   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
  all\n   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\n   and/or
  dedications given therein.\n\n\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\n
  \  unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\n   or the equivalent
  are not considered part of the section titles.\n\n\nM. Delete any section Entitled
  \"Endorsements\".  Such a section\n   may not be included in the Modified Version.\n\n\nN.
  Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\"\n   or to conflict
  in title with any Invariant Section.\n\n\nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nIf
  the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\nappendices that qualify
  as Secondary Sections and contain no material\ncopied from the Document, you may
  at your option designate some or all\nof these sections as invariant.  To do this,
  add their titles to the\nlist of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license
  notice.\nThese titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n\nYou may
  add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains\nnothing but endorsements
  of your Modified Version by various\nparties—for example, statements of peer review
  or that the text has\nbeen approved by an organization as the authoritative definition
  of a\nstandard.\n\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
  and a\npassage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\nof
  Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\nFront-Cover Text and
  one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\nthrough arrangements made by) any one
  entity.  If the Document already\nincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously
  added by you or\nby arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf
  of,\nyou may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\npermission
  from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n\nThe author(s) and publisher(s)
  of the Document do not by this License\ngive permission to use their names for publicity
  for or to assert or\nimply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n\n5. COMBINING
  DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\nLicense,
  under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\nversions, provided that
  you include in the combination all of the\nInvariant Sections of all of the original
  documents, unmodified, and\nlist them all as Invariant Sections of your combined
  work in its\nlicense notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nThe
  combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\nmultiple identical
  Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\ncopy.  If there are multiple Invariant
  Sections with the same name but\ndifferent contents, make the title of each such
  section unique by\nadding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\nauthor
  or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\nMake the same adjustment
  to the section titles in the list of\nInvariant Sections in the license notice of
  the combined work.\n\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
  \"History\"\nin the various original documents, forming one section Entitled\n\"History\";
  likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\nand any sections Entitled
  \"Dedications\".  You must delete all sections\nEntitled \"Endorsements\".\n\n6.
  COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document
  and other\ndocuments released under this License, and replace the individual\ncopies
  of this License in the various documents with a single copy\nthat is included in
  the collection, provided that you follow the rules\nof this License for verbatim
  copying of each of the documents in all\nother respects.\n\nYou may extract a single
  document from such a collection, and\ndistribute it individually under this License,
  provided you insert a\ncopy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
  this\nLicense in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that\ndocument.\n\n7.
  AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives
  with other separate\nand independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
  storage or\ndistribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright\nresulting
  from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights\nof the compilation's
  users beyond what the individual works permit.\nWhen the Document is included in
  an aggregate, this License does not\napply to the other works in the aggregate which
  are not themselves\nderivative works of the Document.\n\nIf the Cover Text requirement
  of section 3 is applicable to these\ncopies of the Document, then if the Document
  is less than one half of\nthe entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
  placed on\ncovers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\nelectronic
  equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\nOtherwise they must
  appear on printed covers that bracket the whole\naggregate.\n\n8. TRANSLATION\n\nTranslation
  is considered a kind of modification, so you may\ndistribute translations of the
  Document under the terms of section 4.\nReplacing Invariant Sections with translations
  requires special\npermission from their copyright holders, but you may include\ntranslations
  of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\noriginal versions of these
  Invariant Sections.  You may include a\ntranslation of this License, and all the
  license notices in the\nDocument, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you
  also include\nthe original English version of this License and the original versions\nof
  those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between\nthe translation
  and the original version of this License or a notice\nor disclaimer, the original
  version will prevail.\n\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\n\"Dedications\",
  or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve\nits Title (section 1) will
  typically require changing the actual\ntitle.\n\n9. TERMINATION\n\nYou may not copy,
  modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document\nexcept as expressly provided under
  this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute
  it is void, and\nwill automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n\nHowever,
  if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\nfrom a particular
  copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\nunless and until the copyright
  holder explicitly and finally\nterminates your license, and (b) permanently, if
  the copyright holder\nfails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
  prior to\n60 days after the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular
  copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you
  of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived
  notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder,
  and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination
  of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who
  have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have
  been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all
  of the same material does\nnot give you any rights to use it.\n\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS
  OF THIS LICENSE\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
  of the\nGNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill
  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in\ndetail to address
  new problems or concerns.  See\nhttp://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n\nEach version of
  the License is given a distinguishing version number.\nIf the Document specifies
  that a particular numbered version of this\nLicense \"or any later version\" applies
  to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that
  specified version or\nof any later version that has been published (not as a draft)
  by the\nFree Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version\nnumber
  of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not\nas a draft) by
  the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document\nspecifies that a proxy can decide
  which future versions of this\nLicense can be used, that proxy's public statement
  of acceptance of a\nversion permanently authorizes you to choose that version for
  the\nDocument.\n\n11. RELICENSING\n\n\"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\"
  (or \"MMC Site\") means any\nWorld Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable
  works and also\nprovides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A\npublic
  wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A\n\"Massive Multiauthor
  Collaboration\" (or \"MMC\") contained in the site\nmeans any set of copyrightable
  works thus published on the MMC site.\n\n\"CC-BY-SA\" means the Creative Commons
  Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 \nlicense published by Creative Commons Corporation,
  a not-for-profit \ncorporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
  \nCalifornia, as well as future copyleft versions of that license \npublished by
  that same organization.\n\n\"Incorporate\" means to publish or republish a Document,
  in whole or in \npart, as part of another Document.\n\nAn MMC is \"eligible for
  relicensing\" if it is licensed under this \nLicense, and if all works that were
  first published under this License \nsomewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
  incorporated in whole or \nin part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant
  sections, and \n(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.\n\nThe operator
  of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site\nunder CC-BY-SA on the
  same site at any time before August 1, 2009,\nprovided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.\n\nADDENDUM:
  How to use this License for your documents\n\nTo use this License in a document
  you have written, include a copy of\nthe License in the document and put the following
  copyright and\nlicense notices just after the title page:\n\n    Copyright (C)  YEAR
  \ YOUR NAME.\n    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\n
  \   under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3\n    or any
  later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\n    with no Invariant
  Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.\n    A copy of the license
  is included in the section entitled \"GNU\n    Free Documentation License\".\n\n\nIf
  you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,\nreplace the
  \"with … Texts.\" line with this:\n\n    with the Invariant Sections being LIST
  THEIR TITLES, with the\n    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover
  Texts being LIST.\n\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some
  other\ncombination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the\nsituation.\n\nIf
  your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we\nrecommend releasing
  these examples in parallel under your choice of\nfree software license, such as
  the GNU General Public License,\nto permit their use in free software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

  Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n     <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to
  copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it
  is not allowed.The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\nfunctional
  and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to\nassure everyone the effective
  freedom to copy and redistribute it,\nwith or without modifying it, either commercially
  or noncommercially.\nSecondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher
  a way\nto get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible\nfor
  modifications made by others.This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means
  that derivative\nworks of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
  \ It\ncomplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\nlicense designed
  for free software.We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
  free\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free\nprogram
  should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\nsoftware does.  But
  this License is not limited to software manuals;\nit can be used for any textual
  work, regardless of subject matter or\nwhether it is published as a printed book.
  \ We recommend this License\nprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction
  or reference.This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\ncontains
  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\ndistributed under the
  terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a\nworld-wide, royalty-free license,
  unlimited in duration, to use that\nwork under the conditions stated herein.  The
  \"Document\", below,\nrefers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public
  is a\nlicensee, and is addressed as \"you\".  You accept the license if you\ncopy,
  modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission\nunder copyright law.A
  \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the\nDocument or
  a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\nmodifications and/or translated
  into another language.A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter
  section of\nthe Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\npublishers
  or authors of the Document to the Document's overall\nsubject (or to related matters)
  and contains nothing that could fall\ndirectly within that overall subject.  (Thus,
  if the Document is in\npart a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
  explain\nany mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\nconnection
  with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\ncommercial, philosophical,
  ethical or political position regarding\nthem.The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain
  Secondary Sections whose titles\nare designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
  in the notice\nthat says that the Document is released under this License.  If a\nsection
  does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not\nallowed to be designated
  as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero\nInvariant Sections.  If the Document
  does not identify any Invariant\nSections then there are none.The \"Cover Texts\"
  are certain short passages of text that are listed,\nas Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover
  Texts, in the notice that says that\nthe Document is released under this License.
  \ A Front-Cover Text may\nbe at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most
  25 words.A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\nrepresented
  in a format whose specification is available to the\ngeneral public, that is suitable
  for revising the document\nstraightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
  composed of\npixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\ndrawing
  editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\nfor automatic translation
  to a variety of formats suitable for input\nto text formatters.  A copy made in
  an otherwise Transparent file\nformat whose markup, or absence of markup, has been
  arranged to thwart\nor discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.\nAn
  image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount\nof text.  A
  copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".Examples of suitable formats
  for Transparent copies include plain\nASCII without markup, Texinfo input format,
  LaTeX input format, SGML\nor XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
  simple\nHTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of\ntransparent
  image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats\ninclude proprietary formats
  that can be read and edited only by\nproprietary word processors, SGML or XML for
  which the DTD and/or\nprocessing tools are not generally available, and the\nmachine-generated
  HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word\nprocessors for output purposes only.The
  \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\nplus such following
  pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\nthis License requires to appear
  in the title page.  For works in\nformats which do not have any title page as such,
  \"Title Page\" means\nthe text near the most prominent appearance of the work's
  title,\npreceding the beginning of the body of the text.The \"publisher\" means
  any person or entity that distributes copies of\nthe Document to the public.A section
  \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose\ntitle either is precisely
  XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\ntext that translates XYZ in another
  language.  (Here XYZ stands for a\nspecific section name mentioned below, such as
  \"Acknowledgements\",\n\"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".)  To \"Preserve
  the Title\"\nof such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains
  a\nsection \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.The Document may include
  Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which\nstates that this License applies
  to the Document.  These Warranty\nDisclaimers are considered to be included by reference
  in this\nLicense, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other\nimplication
  that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has\nno effect on the meaning
  of this License.You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\ncommercially
  or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\ncopyright notices, and the
  license notice saying this License applies\nto the Document are reproduced in all
  copies, and that you add no\nother conditions whatsoever to those of this License.
  \ You may not use\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\ncopying
  of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\ncompensation in
  exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\nnumber of copies you must
  also follow the conditions in section 3.You may also lend copies, under the same
  conditions stated above, and\nyou may publicly display copies.If you publish printed
  copies (or copies in media that commonly have\nprinted covers) of the Document,
  numbering more than 100, and the\nDocument's license notice requires Cover Texts,
  you must enclose the\ncopies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these
  Cover\nTexts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\nthe
  back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\nyou as the publisher
  of these copies.  The front cover must present\nthe full title with all words of
  the title equally prominent and\nvisible.  You may add other material on the covers
  in addition.\nCopying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\nthe
  title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\nas verbatim
  copying in other respects.If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous
  to fit\nlegibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\nreasonably)
  on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\npages.If you publish or
  distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\nmore than 100, you must either
  include a machine-readable Transparent\ncopy along with each Opaque copy, or state
  in or with each Opaque copy\na computer-network location from which the general
  network-using\npublic has access to download using public-standard network protocols\na
  complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.\nIf you use the
  latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,\nwhen you begin distribution
  of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure\nthat this Transparent copy will remain
  thus accessible at the stated\nlocation until at least one year after the last time
  you distribute an\nOpaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of
  that\nedition to the public.It is requested, but not required, that you contact
  the authors of the\nDocument well before redistributing any large number of copies,
  to\ngive them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the\nDocument.You
  may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\nthe conditions
  of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\nthe Modified Version under
  precisely this License, with the Modified\nVersion filling the role of the Document,
  thus licensing distribution\nand modification of the Modified Version to whoever
  possesses a copy\nof it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified
  Version:If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\nappendices
  that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\ncopied from the Document,
  you may at your option designate some or all\nof these sections as invariant.  To
  do this, add their titles to the\nlist of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
  license notice.\nThese titles must be distinct from any other section titles.You
  may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains\nnothing but endorsements
  of your Modified Version by various\nparties—for example, statements of peer review
  or that the text has\nbeen approved by an organization as the authoritative definition
  of a\nstandard.You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
  and a\npassage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\nof
  Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\nFront-Cover Text and
  one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\nthrough arrangements made by) any one
  entity.  If the Document already\nincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously
  added by you or\nby arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf
  of,\nyou may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\npermission
  from the previous publisher that added the old one.The author(s) and publisher(s)
  of the Document do not by this License\ngive permission to use their names for publicity
  for or to assert or\nimply endorsement of any Modified Version.You may combine the
  Document with other documents released under this\nLicense, under the terms defined
  in section 4 above for modified\nversions, provided that you include in the combination
  all of the\nInvariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\nlist
  them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\nlicense notice, and
  that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.The combined work need only contain
  one copy of this License, and\nmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
  with a single\ncopy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
  but\ndifferent contents, make the title of each such section unique by\nadding at
  the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\nauthor or publisher of
  that section if known, or else a unique number.\nMake the same adjustment to the
  section titles in the list of\nInvariant Sections in the license notice of the combined
  work.In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\"\nin
  the various original documents, forming one section Entitled\n\"History\"; likewise
  combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\nand any sections Entitled \"Dedications\".
  \ You must delete all sections\nEntitled \"Endorsements\".You may make a collection
  consisting of the Document and other\ndocuments released under this License, and
  replace the individual\ncopies of this License in the various documents with a single
  copy\nthat is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules\nof
  this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all\nother respects.You
  may extract a single document from such a collection, and\ndistribute it individually
  under this License, provided you insert a\ncopy of this License into the extracted
  document, and follow this\nLicense in all other respects regarding verbatim copying
  of that\ndocument.A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\nand
  independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution
  medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright\nresulting from the compilation
  is not used to limit the legal rights\nof the compilation's users beyond what the
  individual works permit.\nWhen the Document is included in an aggregate, this License
  does not\napply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves\nderivative
  works of the Document.If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
  these\ncopies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of\nthe
  entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on\ncovers that bracket
  the Document within the aggregate, or the\nelectronic equivalent of covers if the
  Document is in electronic form.\nOtherwise they must appear on printed covers that
  bracket the whole\naggregate.Translation is considered a kind of modification, so
  you may\ndistribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\nReplacing
  Invariant Sections with translations requires special\npermission from their copyright
  holders, but you may include\ntranslations of some or all Invariant Sections in
  addition to the\noriginal versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include
  a\ntranslation of this License, and all the license notices in the\nDocument, and
  any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\nthe original English version
  of this License and the original versions\nof those notices and disclaimers.  In
  case of a disagreement between\nthe translation and the original version of this
  License or a notice\nor disclaimer, the original version will prevail.If a section
  in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\n\"Dedications\", or \"History\",
  the requirement (section 4) to Preserve\nits Title (section 1) will typically require
  changing the actual\ntitle.You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
  Document\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise
  to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and\nwill automatically terminate
  your rights under this License.However, if you cease all violation of this License,
  then your license\nfrom a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\nunless
  and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\nterminates your license,
  and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder\nfails to notify you of the violation
  by some reasonable means prior to\n60 days after the cessation.Moreover, your license
  from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder
  notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time
  you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright
  holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.Termination
  of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who
  have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have
  been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all
  of the same material does\nnot give you any rights to use it.The Free Software Foundation

  to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but
  may differ in\ndetail to address new problems or concerns.  See\nhttp://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.Each
  version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\nIf the Document
  specifies that a particular numbered version of this\nLicense \"or any later version\"
  applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either
  of that specified version or\nof any later version that has been published (not
  as a draft) by the\nFree Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify
  a version\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not\nas
  a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document\nspecifies that a proxy
  can decide which future versions of this\nLicense can be used, that proxy's public
  statement of acceptance of a\nversion permanently authorizes you to choose that
  version for the\nDocument.\"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\" (or \"MMC Site\")
