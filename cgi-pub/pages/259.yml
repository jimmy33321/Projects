                  ALIENATION IN HEGELAND MARX
- |2
                  Although its roots lie far back in the
- |2
                      Judeo-Christian tradition, the concept of alienation first gained promi- nence in the philosophy of Hegel, and
- |2
                      particularly in his mature writings. There are signs of the idea in
- |2
                      his earlier works, but it is not until the Phenomenology (1808), thought by many to be Hegel's most
- |2
                      important work, that alienation occupies a central place in his
- |2
                      writings.
- |2
                  In the opening sections of the Phenomenology Hegel
- |2
                      attacked the views of common sense and simplified natural science that the
- |2
                      world consisted of discrete objects independent of man's consciousness.
- |2
                      Truth, for Hegel, was not to be found in knowledge that was purified
- |2
                      of any influence from man's own desires and feelings. Ultimately Hegel
- |2
                      considered that there could be no truth that was not intimately linked with
- |2
                      the ongoing process of human beings as thinking subjects; truth was
- |2
                          their truth. The supposed objectivity of the
- |2
                      world of nature was in fact an alienation, for man's task was to discover,
- |2
                      behind these appearances, his own essential life and finally to view
- |2
                      everything as a facet of his own self-consciousness. The same principle
- |2
                          ap- plied to the world of culture in which
- |2
                      such spheres as art and religion, if viewed as independent of man,
- |2
                      constituted so many alienations to be overcome by integration into the
- |2
                      final understanding and recapitula- tion
- |2
                      which was Absolute Knowledge.
- "                \n"
- |2
                   The central actor in this process for Hegel was Spirit. Hegel thought that
- |2
                      reality was Spirit developing itself. In this process Spirit produced a
- |2
                      world that it thought at first was external; only later did it realize that
- |2
                      this world was its own production. Spirit was not something separated
- |2
                      from this productive activity; it only existed in and through this
- |2
                      activity. At the beginning of this process Spirit was not aware that it was
- |2
                      externalizing or alienating itself. Only gradually did Spirit realize
- |2
                      that the world was not external to it. It was the failure to realize this
- |2
                      that constituted, for Hegel, alienation. This alienation would cease when
- |2
                      men became fully self-conscious and understood their environment and
- |2
                      their culture to be emanations of Spirit. Freedom con- sisted in this understanding, and freedom was the aim
- |2
                      of history.
- |2
                  Hegel had created a system; and all his disciples agreed that it was the
- |2
                      final one. However, when it came to applying the system to particular
- |2
                      problems, they conceived their Master's system to be ambivalent. The
- |2
                      fact that alienation seemed to them to be a challenge, something to be
- |2
                      overcome, led them to put the em- phasis on the
- |2
                      concepts of dialectic and negativity in Hegel's system; and thus they
- |2
                      challenged, first in reli- gion and then in
- |2
                      politics, the Master's view that the problem of alienation had, at least in
- |2
                      principle, been solved. The foremost among these radical disciples of
- |2
                      Hegel, Bruno Bauer, applied the concept of alienation to the religious
- |2
                      field. Bauer, who lectured in theology and made his name as a Gospel
- |2
                      critic, considered that religious beliefs, and in particular Christianity,
- |2
                      caused a division in man's consciousness by becoming opposed to this
- |2
                      consciousness as a separate power. Thus religion was an attitude towards
- |2
                      the essence of self-conscious- ness
- |2
                      that had become estranged from itself. In this context, Bauer promoted the
- |2
                      use of the expression “self-alienation” that soon
- |2
                      became current among the Young Hegelians.
- |2
                  Like Bruno Bauer, Ludwig Feuerbach was also fas-
- |2
                          cinated by the problem of religious alienation, but his concept
- |2
                      of it was much simpler. Whereas Bauer con-
- |2
                      sidered that men's religious creations eventually adopted an inhuman
- |2
                      form, Feuerbach saw in religion simply the projection of man's essential
- |2
                      desires and capacities. Since what was ascribed to God were really
- |2
                      attributes of man, man was separated from himself, and thus alienated. This
- |2
                      idea was elaborated in Feuerbach's best known book The
- |2
                          Essence of Christianity, published in 1841. Feuerbach described
- |2
                      the “fundamental idea” of his book thus:
- |2
                      “The objective essence of religion, particularly the Christian
- |2
                      religion, is nothing but the essence of human, and particularly Christian,
- |2
                      feeling. The secret of theology is therefore anthropology.... The
- |2
                      foundation of a new science is laid here in that038
- |2
                       the philosophy of religion is conceived of and pre- sented as esoteric or secret anthropology or psychol- ogy” (McLellan [1969], p.
- |2
                      88).
- |2
                  Feuerbach made an even greater impact through hisPreliminary Theses for the Reform of Philosophy and
- |2
                      his Foundations of the Philosophy of the Future,
- |2
                      both published in 1843. Their major purpose was to point out that
- |2
                      Hegel's philosophy was just as alienating a force as religion and needed to
- |2
                      be reabsorbed in the same manner. Feuerbach began his Theses with the statement “the secret of theology is
- |2
                      anthropology, but the secret of speculative philosophy is
- |2
                      theology” (ibid., p. 98). In Feuerbach's view, the great
- |2
                      deficiency in Hegel's philosophy was its negation of theology
- |2
                      “from the standpoint of theology.” Thus
- |2
                      Hegel—the German Proclus—never managed to break out
- |2
                      of the circle of ideas and could not realize the true relationship of
- |2
                      thought to being: “being is the subject, thought the
- |2
                      predicate.” As a philosopher in his own right, Feuer- bach was only of the second rank: basically he had
- |2
                      one idea that he expounded in many different ways. As Marx said later:
- |2
                      “Compared with Hegel, Feuerbach is very poor. Nevertheless,
- |2
                      after Hegel he was epoch- making because he
- |2
                      put the emphasis on certain points, uncomfortable for the Christian
- |2
                      consciousness and im- portant for the progress
- |2
                      of criticism, which Hegel had left in a sort of mystical twilight between
- |2
                      clarity and obscurity” (ibid., p. 113).
- |2
                  It was in this atmosphere of rapid secularization that Marx evolved his own
- |2
                      concept of alienation. Bruno Bauer had talked of alienation in religion;
- |2
                      Feuerbach had carried this further by pointing out that Hegel's
- |2
                      philosophy was itself the last bastion of theology; finally Moses
- |2
                      Hess—nicknamed “the communist
- |2
                      rabbi”—had transferred Feuerbach's ideas to the realm
- |2
                      of economics, by analyzing, in his essay On the Essence
- |2
                          of Money (1844), money as the alienated essence of man. Marx
- |2
                      accepted all these accounts of alienation, considering economics to be
- |2
                      fundamental inasmuch as work was man's basic activity. In all these fields
- |2
                      Marx's common idea was that man had alienated to someone or something
- |2
                      what was essential to his nature— principally, to be in control
- |2
                      of his own activities, to be the subject and initiator of the historical
- |2
                      process. In the different forms of alienation some other entity had
- |2
                      obtained what was proper to man: in religion it was God, in politics the
- |2
                      State, in economics the market process and cash nexus. (A note is necessary
- |2
                      on the German originals of the term “alienation.”
- |2
                      Marx uses two words to express the concept of alienation:Entfremdung and Entäusserung. His distinction be-
- |2
                      tween these two words is by no means as precise as that of Hegel.
- |2
                      Often they appear to be synonymous and are used together for rhetorical
- |2
                      effect. If anything,Entfremdung conveys the sense of alienation in which
- |2
                       two people are said to be alienated from each other; while Entässerung has more the sense of
- |2
                      “making external to oneself” with legal and
- |2
                      commercial over- tones. Neither of these words
- |2
                      is to be confused withVergegenständlichung, that is,
- |2
                      “objectification,” which, in Marx as opposed to
- |2
                      Hegel, is a neutral process that can be either good or bad according to the
- |2
                          partic- ular circumstances.)
- |2
                  Marx first worked out his ideas in detail with regard to political
- |2
                      alienation in his Critique of Hegel's Philos- ophy of Right. Here Marx examined paragraph
- |2
                      by paragraph Hegel's Philosophy of Right and
- |2
                      claimed that the state, described by Hegel as productive of, and
- |2
                      superior to, its own elements, constituted an aliena- tion of man's essence. Applying to Hegel
- |2
                      Feuerbach's reversal of subject and predicate, Marx wrote:
- |2
                      “The Idea is made subjective and the true relationship of
- |2
                      the family and civil society to the state is conceived of as their
- |2
                      imaginary activity. The family and civil society are the presuppositions of
- |2
                      the state; they are its properly active elements. But in speculation
- |2
                      the relationship is inverted. When the Idea is made a subject, the
- |2
                      civil society, the family, 'circumstances, caprice' etc. become unreal
- |2
                      objective phrases of the Idea and have a completely different
- |2
                      significance” (Early Texts, p. 62).
- |2
                  The place where Marx wrote at greatst length on his concept of alienation
- |2
                      and his debt to Hegel are two passages in the Paris
- |2
                          Manuscripts. In the passage on “alienated
- |2
                      labour” (ibid., pp. 133ff.), Marx deals with the relationship of
- |2
                      the worker to his product. The fact that the worker is related to the
- |2
                      product of his labor as to an alien object means that the more the
- |2
                      worker produces the more he approaches loss of work and starvation. Marx
- |2
                      goes on to detail four types of alienated labor: the alienation of the
- |2
                      product from the producer; the alienation of the act of production;
- |2
                      the alienation of nature from men; and finally of man from his
- |2
                      species-being (a term borrowed from Feuerbach meaning the common factors
- |2
                      making up man's nature). This negative picture is complemented by the descrip- tion that Marx gives of unalienated
- |2
                      man in the notes that he made on James Mill at the same time as the
- |2
                      writing of the Manuscripts. Put rather roughly, what
- |2
                      Marx means when he talks of alienation is this: it is man's nature to be
- |2
                      his own creator; he forms and develops himself by working on and
- |2
                      transforming the world outside him in cooperation with his fellow men.
- |2
                      In this progressive interchange between man and the world, it is man's
- |2
                      nature to be in control of this process, to be the initiator, the subject
- |2
                      in which the process originates. However, this nature has become alien
- |2
                      to man; that is, it is no longer his and belongs to another person or
- |2
                      thing. In religion, for example, it is God who is the subject of the
- |2
                      historical process and man is in039
- |2
                       a state of dependence on His grace. In economics, according to
- |2
                      Marx, it is money and the processes of the market that maneuver men around
- |2
                      instead of being controlled by them. The central point is that man has
- |2
                      lost control of his own evolution and has seen this control invested in
- |2
                      other entities. What is proper to man has become the attribute of something
- |2
                      else, and thus alien to him.
- |2
                  The second passage of importance in the Paris Man- uscripts is the final section
- |2
                      entitled Critique of Hegel's Dialectic (ibid., pp.
- |2
                      157ff.). Here Marx began by de- scribing
- |2
                      Feuerbach's “great achievement” which was to have
- |2
                      demonstrated that Hegel's philosophy was merely a different form of the
- |2
                      alienation of man's nature; Feuerbach had reestablished the primacy of
- |2
                      man's social relationship to man. Marx readily ac-
- |2
                          knowledged his own debt to Hegel. “Therefore the
- |2
                      greatness of Hegel's Phenomenology,” he wrote,
- |2
                      “and its final product, the dialectic of negativity as the
- |2
                      moving and creating principle, is that Hegel conceived of the self-creation
- |2
                      of man as a process, objectification as loss of the object, as
- |2
                      externalisation and the tran- scendence of
- |2
                      this externalisation. This means, therefore, that he grasps the nature of
- |2
                      labour and understands objective man, true, because real man, as the
- |2
                      result of his own labour” (ibid., p. 164). Nevertheless,
- |2
                      Hegel's conception of labor was of abstract, mental labor and he only
- |2
                      succeeded in overcoming alienation in the realm of consciousness.
- |2
                  Although Hegel said that man suffered from eco-
- |2
                      nomic and political alienation, it was only the thought of economics
- |2
                      and politics in which Hegel was inter- ested.
- |2
                      The whole process ended in Absolute Knowl-
- |2
                      edge, with the result that it was the philosopher who judged the
- |2
                      world. In other words, Hegel had confused alienation and objectivity. Thus,
- |2
                      according to Hegel, “What is supposed to be the essence of
- |2
                      alienation that needs to be transcended is not that man's being ob- jectifies itself in an inhuman way in
- |2
                      opposition to itself, but that it objectifies itself in distinction from
- |2
                      and in opposition to, abstract thought. The appropriation of man's
- |2
                      objectified and alienated faculties is thus firstly only an appropriation
- |2
                      that occurs in the mind, in pure thought, i.e. in abstraction”
- |2
                      (ibid., pp. 162f.). Marx's central criticism of Hegel, therefore, was that
- |2
                          aliena- tion would not cease with the
- |2
                      supposed abolition of the external world. The external world, according
- |2
                      to Marx, was part of man's nature and the point was to establish the
- |2
                      right relationship between man and his environment. Marx therefore rejected
- |2
                      Hegel's notion of Spirit and replaced its supposed antithesis to the
- |2
                      external world by the antithesis between man and his social being.
- |2
                  In his early writings, therefore, Marx sketched a notion of alienation
- |2
                      which, taking the analyses in reli
- |2
                      gion and politics of his contemporary Young Hegelians as models,
- |2
                      had its roots in the socioeconomic situation of the worker in capitalist
- |2
                      society. Yet in the 1930's and '40's, alienation did not play any part in
- |2
                      the many discussions of Marx's thought. In the 1960's, however, it was
- |2
                      accepted that it is the major theme running through
- |2
                      the whole of his writings. Those who wish to maintain that there is a break
- |2
                      between the “young” and the
- |2
                      “old” Marx usually maintain that alienation is a
- |2
                      concept that was entirely restricted to Marx's early thought and later
- |2
                      abandoned. However, these state- ments can be
- |2
                      shown to be incorrect.
- |2
                  The term itself occurs much more frequently, even in Capital, than is commonly realized. In Capital
- |2
                      Marx writes, for example: “The character of independence
- |2
                      and estrangement which the capitalist modes of pro-
- |2
                          duction as a whole give to the instruments of labour and the
- |2
                      product, as against the workman, is developed by means of machinery into a
- |2
                      thorough antagonism” (I, 432). Yet it is not only a question of
- |2
                      terminology: the content, too, of Capital is a
- |2
                      continuation of Marx's early thoughts. The main discussion of Volume
- |2
                      One of Capital rests on the equation of work and
- |2
                      value that goes back to the conception of man as a being who creates
- |2
                      himself and the conditions of his life—a con- ception outlined in the Paris
- |2
                          Manuscripts. It is man's nature, according to the Marx of the Paris Manuscripts, to be constantly developing, in
- |2
                      cooperation with other men, himself and the world about him. What Marx
- |2
                      in Capital is describing is how this fundamental
- |2
                      role of man, to be the initiator and controller of the histori- cal process, has been transferred, or
- |2
                      alienated, and how it belongs to the inhuman power of Capital.
- |2
                  The counterpart of alienated man, the unalienated or
- |2
                      “total” man of the Manuscripts,
- |2
                      also appears inCapital. In the chapter of Volume One on
- |2
                      “Machinery and Modern Industry” Marx makes the same
- |2
                      contrast between the effects of alienated and unalienated modes of
- |2
                      production on the development of human poten-
- |2
                          tiality. He writes: “Modern industry, indeed, compels
- |2
                      society, under penalty of death, to replace the detail- worker of today, crippled by the life-long
- |2
                      repetition of one and the same trivial operation, and thus reduced to
- |2
                      the mere fragment of a man, by the fully developed individual, fit for a
- |2
                      variety of labours, ready to face any change of production, and to whom the
- |2
                      different social functions he performs, are but so many modes of
- |2
                      giving free scope to his own natural and acquired powers.” The
- |2
                      fact that, in Capital, the conclusion is supported
- |2
                      by a detailed analysis of the effects of ad-
- |2
                      vanced technology, should not obscure the continuity.
- |2
                  The section of Capital that most recalls the early
- |2
                      writings, is the final section of Chapter One, entitled
- |2
                      “Fetishism of Commodities.” The whole section is
- |2
                      reminiscent of the passage on alienated labor in the040
- "                    \n"
- |2
                      Paris Manuscripts and of the notes on James Mill
- |2
                      that Marx composed in 1844. Marx writes:
- "                \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          A commodity is therefore a mysterious thing, simply because in it
- |2
                              the social character of man's labour appears to them as an
- |2
                              objective character stamped upon that labour; because the relation
- |2
                              of the producers to the sum total of their labour, is presented to
- |2
                              them as a social relation, existing not be-
- |2
                                  tween themselves, but between the products of their
- |2
                          labour
- "                    \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          (I, 488).
- "                    \n"
- "                \n"
- |2
                  However, the writing that best shows the centrality of the concept of
- |2
                      alienation to Marx's thought is theGrundrisse. This manuscript is the thousand-page
- |2
                      draft that served Marx as a basis for Capital but
- |2
                      remained unpublished until 1941. The Grundrisse, of
- |2
                      which theCritique of Political Economy and Capital are only partial elaborations, is the centerpiece of
- |2
                      Marx's work. It is the basic work which permitted the generaliza- tions in the famous Preface to the Critique of
- |2
                          Political Economy. For Capital is only the
- |2
                      first of the six volumes in which Marx wished to develop his Economics, the title by which he referred to his
- |2
                          magnum opus on the alienation of man
- |2
                      through Capital and the State.
- |2
                  The scope of the Grundrisse being wider than that of
- |2
                          Capital, Marx's thought is best viewed as a con- tinuing meditation on themes begun in
- |2
                      1844, the high point in which meditation occurred in 1857-58. The
- |2
                      continuity between the Manuscripts and the Grundrisse is evident. Marx himself talked of the
- |2
                          Grundrisse as “the result of fifteen
- |2
                      years of research, thus the best period of my life.” This latter
- |2
                      was written in November 1858, exactly fifteen years after Marx's arrival in
- |2
                      Paris in November 1843. He also says, in the Preface
- |2
                      of 1859: “the total material lies before me in the form of mono- graphs, which were written at widely
- |2
                      separated pe- riods, for self-clarification, not
- |2
                      for publication, and whose coherent elaboration according to the plan indi- cated will depend on external
- |2
                      circumstances.” This can only refer to the Paris Manuscripts of 1844 and the London notebooks of 1850-52.
- |2
                      Marx constantly used, and at the same time revised, material from an
- |2
                      earlier date: for instance, he used his notebooks of 1843-45 while
- |2
                      writing Capital.
- |2
                  The content of the Grundrisse only serves to confirm
- |2
                      what is plain from the external evidence: the beginning of the chapter on
- |2
                          Capital reproduces almost word for word the
- |2
                      passages in the Manuscripts on human need, man as a
- |2
                      species-being, the individual as a social being, the idea of nature as, in
- |2
                      a sense, man's body, the paral- lels between
- |2
                      religious and economic alienation, the utopian and almost millennial
- |2
                      elements, etc. One point in particular emphasizes this continuity: the Grundrisse are as Hegelian as the Paris Manuscripts and the central concept of both of them is
- |2
                      alienation.
- |2
                  Aided by the publication of Marx's early writings,
- |2
                       the increasing complexity and anonymity of capitalist society,
- |2
                      and the gap between ideology and reality in many socialist ones, the
- |2
                      concept of alienation has be- come very topical.
- |2
                      Its very topicality, however, is in danger of rendering the concept of
- |2
                      alienation vacuous; for often it seems merely to be used to designate
- |2
                      any state of affairs that is considered unsatisfactory. How- ever, Marx's description of alienation, particularly
- |2
                      as contained in the Paris Manuscripts, is by no
- |2
                      means as vacuous as many of its contemporary interpretations. For it
- |2
                      contains both an account of the relationship between socioeconomic
- |2
                      conditions and psychological states that is, to some extent at least,
- |2
                      testable, and also a far from vague view of human nature. Because it
- |2
                      contains both of these it is also a concept in which facts and values are
- |2
                      inextricably bound together, and so one which runs counter to the
- |2
                      prevailing demand for a sharp distinction between evaluative and descrip- tive statements. Thus, although Marx
- |2
                      was always writ- ing with certain initial value
- |2
                      judgments presupposed, empirical criteria are, up to a point, applicable to
- |2
                      his hypotheses. Marx's concept can be further clarified by asking what
- |2
                      he would consider as nonalienation. This positive side of Marx's critique
- |2
                      is less well-known. But the passage on “alienated
- |2
                      labour” in the Paris Manu- scripts should be read in close conjunction with
- |2
                      his description of “production in a human manner”
- |2
                          con- tained in his notes on James Mill,
- |2
                      and with the concep- tion of the future
- |2
                      communist society outlined in theGrundrisse. The metaphysical and ethical elements of
- |2
                      the concept of alienation that originated with Hegel and Feuerbach still
- |2
                      persist to some extent in Marx, but they are given a socioeconomic context
- |2
                      that makes them all the more interesting to the modern mind.

               Dictionary of the History of IdeasAlthough its roots lie far back in the
- |2
                      Judeo-Christian tradition, the concept of alienation first gained promi- nence in the philosophy of Hegel, and
- |2
                      particularly in his mature writings. There are signs of the idea in
- |2
                      his earlier works, but it is not until the Phenomenology (1808), thought by many to be Hegel's most
- |2
                      important work, that alienation occupies a central place in his
- |2
                      writings.In the opening sections of the Phenomenology Hegel
- |2
                      attacked the views of common sense and simplified natural science that the
- |2
                      world consisted of discrete objects independent of man's consciousness.
- |2
                      Truth, for Hegel, was not to be found in knowledge that was purified
- |2
                      of any influence from man's own desires and feelings. Ultimately Hegel
- |2
                      considered that there could be no truth that was not intimately linked with
- |2
                      the ongoing process of human beings as thinking subjects; truth was
- |2
                          their truth. The supposed objectivity of the
- |2
                      world of nature was in fact an alienation, for man's task was to discover,
- |2
                      behind these appearances, his own essential life and finally to view
- |2
                      everything as a facet of his own self-consciousness. The same principle
- |2
                          ap- plied to the world of culture in which
- |2
                      such spheres as art and religion, if viewed as independent of man,
- |2
                      constituted so many alienations to be overcome by integration into the
- |2
                      final understanding and recapitula- tion
- |2
                      which was Absolute Knowledge. The central actor in this process for Hegel was Spirit. Hegel thought that
- |2
                      reality was Spirit developing itself. In this process Spirit produced a
- |2
                      world that it thought at first was external; only later did it realize that
- |2
                      this world was its own production. Spirit was not something separated
- |2
                      from this productive activity; it only existed in and through this
- |2
                      activity. At the beginning of this process Spirit was not aware that it was
- |2
                      externalizing or alienating itself. Only gradually did Spirit realize
- |2
                      that the world was not external to it. It was the failure to realize this
- |2
                      that constituted, for Hegel, alienation. This alienation would cease when
- |2
                      men became fully self-conscious and understood their environment and
- |2
                      their culture to be emanations of Spirit. Freedom con- sisted in this understanding, and freedom was the aim
- |2
                      of history.Hegel had created a system; and all his disciples agreed that it was the
- |2
                      final one. However, when it came to applying the system to particular
- |2
                      problems, they conceived their Master's system to be ambivalent. The
- |2
                      fact that alienation seemed to them to be a challenge, something to be
- |2
                      overcome, led them to put the em- phasis on the
- |2
                      concepts of dialectic and negativity in Hegel's system; and thus they
- |2
                      challenged, first in reli- gion and then in
- |2
                      politics, the Master's view that the problem of alienation had, at least in
- |2
                      principle, been solved. The foremost among these radical disciples of
- |2
                      Hegel, Bruno Bauer, applied the concept of alienation to the religious
- |2
                      field. Bauer, who lectured in theology and made his name as a Gospel
- |2
                      critic, considered that religious beliefs, and in particular Christianity,
- |2
                      caused a division in man's consciousness by becoming opposed to this
- |2
                      consciousness as a separate power. Thus religion was an attitude towards
- |2
                      the essence of self-conscious- ness
- |2
                      that had become estranged from itself. In this context, Bauer promoted the
- |2
                      use of the expression “self-alienation” that soon
- |2
                      became current among the Young Hegelians.Like Bruno Bauer, Ludwig Feuerbach was also fas-
- |2
                          cinated by the problem of religious alienation, but his concept
- |2
                      of it was much simpler. Whereas Bauer con-
- |2
                      sidered that men's religious creations eventually adopted an inhuman
- |2
                      form, Feuerbach saw in religion simply the projection of man's essential
- |2
                      desires and capacities. Since what was ascribed to God were really
- |2
                      attributes of man, man was separated from himself, and thus alienated. This
- |2
                      idea was elaborated in Feuerbach's best known book The
- |2
                          Essence of Christianity, published in 1841. Feuerbach described
- |2
                      the “fundamental idea” of his book thus:
- |2
                      “The objective essence of religion, particularly the Christian
- |2
                      religion, is nothing but the essence of human, and particularly Christian,
- |2
                      feeling. The secret of theology is therefore anthropology.... The
- |2
                      foundation of a new science is laid here in thatFeuerbach made an even greater impact through hisPreliminary Theses for the Reform of Philosophy and
- |2
                      his Foundations of the Philosophy of the Future,
- |2
                      both published in 1843. Their major purpose was to point out that
- |2
                      Hegel's philosophy was just as alienating a force as religion and needed to
- |2
                      be reabsorbed in the same manner. Feuerbach began his Theses with the statement “the secret of theology is
- |2
                      anthropology, but the secret of speculative philosophy is
- |2
                      theology” (ibid., p. 98). In Feuerbach's view, the great
- |2
                      deficiency in Hegel's philosophy was its negation of theology
- |2
                      “from the standpoint of theology.” Thus
- |2
                      Hegel—the German Proclus—never managed to break out
- |2
                      of the circle of ideas and could not realize the true relationship of
- |2
                      thought to being: “being is the subject, thought the
- |2
                      predicate.” As a philosopher in his own right, Feuer- bach was only of the second rank: basically he had
- |2
                      one idea that he expounded in many different ways. As Marx said later:
- |2
                      “Compared with Hegel, Feuerbach is very poor. Nevertheless,
- |2
                      after Hegel he was epoch- making because he
- |2
                      put the emphasis on certain points, uncomfortable for the Christian
- |2
                      consciousness and im- portant for the progress
- |2
                      of criticism, which Hegel had left in a sort of mystical twilight between
- |2
                      clarity and obscurity” (ibid., p. 113).It was in this atmosphere of rapid secularization that Marx evolved his own
- |2
                      concept of alienation. Bruno Bauer had talked of alienation in religion;
- |2
                      Feuerbach had carried this further by pointing out that Hegel's
- |2
                      philosophy was itself the last bastion of theology; finally Moses
- |2
                      Hess—nicknamed “the communist
- |2
                      rabbi”—had transferred Feuerbach's ideas to the realm
- |2
                      of economics, by analyzing, in his essay On the Essence
- |2
                          of Money (1844), money as the alienated essence of man. Marx
- |2
                      accepted all these accounts of alienation, considering economics to be
- |2
                      fundamental inasmuch as work was man's basic activity. In all these fields
- |2
                      Marx's common idea was that man had alienated to someone or something
- |2
                      what was essential to his nature— principally, to be in control
- |2
                      of his own activities, to be the subject and initiator of the historical
- |2
                      process. In the different forms of alienation some other entity had
- |2
                      obtained what was proper to man: in religion it was God, in politics the
- |2
                      State, in economics the market process and cash nexus. (A note is necessary
- |2
                      on the German originals of the term “alienation.”
- |2
                      Marx uses two words to express the concept of alienation:Entfremdung and Entäusserung. His distinction be-
- |2
                      tween these two words is by no means as precise as that of Hegel.
- |2
                      Often they appear to be synonymous and are used together for rhetorical
- |2
                      effect. If anything,Entfremdung conveys the sense of alienation in which
- |2
                       two people are said to be alienated from each other; while Entässerung has more the sense of
- |2
                      “making external to oneself” with legal and
- |2
                      commercial over- tones. Neither of these words
- |2
                      is to be confused withVergegenständlichung, that is,
- |2
                      “objectification,” which, in Marx as opposed to
- |2
                      Hegel, is a neutral process that can be either good or bad according to the
- |2
                          partic- ular circumstances.)Marx first worked out his ideas in detail with regard to political
- |2
                      alienation in his Critique of Hegel's Philos- ophy of Right. Here Marx examined paragraph
- |2
                      by paragraph Hegel's Philosophy of Right and
- |2
                      claimed that the state, described by Hegel as productive of, and
- |2
                      superior to, its own elements, constituted an aliena- tion of man's essence. Applying to Hegel
- |2
                      Feuerbach's reversal of subject and predicate, Marx wrote:
- |2
                      “The Idea is made subjective and the true relationship of
- |2
                      the family and civil society to the state is conceived of as their
- |2
                      imaginary activity. The family and civil society are the presuppositions of
- |2
                      the state; they are its properly active elements. But in speculation
- |2
                      the relationship is inverted. When the Idea is made a subject, the
- |2
                      civil society, the family, 'circumstances, caprice' etc. become unreal
- |2
                      objective phrases of the Idea and have a completely different
- |2
                      significance” (Early Texts, p. 62).The place where Marx wrote at greatst length on his concept of alienation
- |2
                      and his debt to Hegel are two passages in the Paris
- |2
                          Manuscripts. In the passage on “alienated
- |2
                      labour” (ibid., pp. 133ff.), Marx deals with the relationship of
- |2
                      the worker to his product. The fact that the worker is related to the
- |2
                      product of his labor as to an alien object means that the more the
- |2
                      worker produces the more he approaches loss of work and starvation. Marx
- |2
                      goes on to detail four types of alienated labor: the alienation of the
- |2
                      product from the producer; the alienation of the act of production;
- |2
                      the alienation of nature from men; and finally of man from his
- |2
                      species-being (a term borrowed from Feuerbach meaning the common factors
- |2
                      making up man's nature). This negative picture is complemented by the descrip- tion that Marx gives of unalienated
- |2
                      man in the notes that he made on James Mill at the same time as the
- |2
                      writing of the Manuscripts. Put rather roughly, what
- |2
                      Marx means when he talks of alienation is this: it is man's nature to be
- |2
                      his own creator; he forms and develops himself by working on and
- |2
                      transforming the world outside him in cooperation with his fellow men.
- |2
                      In this progressive interchange between man and the world, it is man's
- |2
                      nature to be in control of this process, to be the initiator, the subject
- |2
                      in which the process originates. However, this nature has become alien
- |2
                      to man; that is, it is no longer his and belongs to another person or
- |2
                      thing. In religion, for example, it is God who is the subject of the
- |2
                      historical process and man is inThe second passage of importance in the Paris Man- uscripts is the final section
- |2
                      entitled Critique of Hegel's Dialectic (ibid., pp.
- |2
                      157ff.). Here Marx began by de- scribing
- |2
                      Feuerbach's “great achievement” which was to have
- |2
                      demonstrated that Hegel's philosophy was merely a different form of the
- |2
                      alienation of man's nature; Feuerbach had reestablished the primacy of
- |2
                      man's social relationship to man. Marx readily ac-
- |2
                          knowledged his own debt to Hegel. “Therefore the
- |2
                      greatness of Hegel's Phenomenology,” he wrote,
- |2
                      “and its final product, the dialectic of negativity as the
- |2
                      moving and creating principle, is that Hegel conceived of the self-creation
- |2
                      of man as a process, objectification as loss of the object, as
- |2
                      externalisation and the tran- scendence of
- |2
                      this externalisation. This means, therefore, that he grasps the nature of
- |2
                      labour and understands objective man, true, because real man, as the
- |2
                      result of his own labour” (ibid., p. 164). Nevertheless,
- |2
                      Hegel's conception of labor was of abstract, mental labor and he only
- |2
                      succeeded in overcoming alienation in the realm of consciousness.Although Hegel said that man suffered from eco-
- |2
                      nomic and political alienation, it was only the thought of economics
- |2
                      and politics in which Hegel was inter- ested.
- |2
                      The whole process ended in Absolute Knowl-
- |2
                      edge, with the result that it was the philosopher who judged the
- |2
                      world. In other words, Hegel had confused alienation and objectivity. Thus,
- |2
                      according to Hegel, “What is supposed to be the essence of
- |2
                      alienation that needs to be transcended is not that man's being ob- jectifies itself in an inhuman way in
- |2
                      opposition to itself, but that it objectifies itself in distinction from
- |2
                      and in opposition to, abstract thought. The appropriation of man's
- |2
                      objectified and alienated faculties is thus firstly only an appropriation
- |2
                      that occurs in the mind, in pure thought, i.e. in abstraction”
- |2
                      (ibid., pp. 162f.). Marx's central criticism of Hegel, therefore, was that
- |2
                          aliena- tion would not cease with the
- |2
                      supposed abolition of the external world. The external world, according
- |2
                      to Marx, was part of man's nature and the point was to establish the
- |2
                      right relationship between man and his environment. Marx therefore rejected
- |2
                      Hegel's notion of Spirit and replaced its supposed antithesis to the
- |2
                      external world by the antithesis between man and his social being.In his early writings, therefore, Marx sketched a notion of alienation
- |2
                      which, taking the analyses in reli
- |2
                      gion and politics of his contemporary Young Hegelians as models,
- |2
                      had its roots in the socioeconomic situation of the worker in capitalist
- |2
                      society. Yet in the 1930's and '40's, alienation did not play any part in
- |2
                      the many discussions of Marx's thought. In the 1960's, however, it was
- |2
                      accepted that it is the major theme running through
- |2
                      the whole of his writings. Those who wish to maintain that there is a break
- |2
                      between the “young” and the
- |2
                      “old” Marx usually maintain that alienation is a
- |2
                      concept that was entirely restricted to Marx's early thought and later
- |2
                      abandoned. However, these state- ments can be
- |2
                      shown to be incorrect.The term itself occurs much more frequently, even in Capital, than is commonly realized. In Capital
- |2
                      Marx writes, for example: “The character of independence
- |2
                      and estrangement which the capitalist modes of pro-
- |2
                          duction as a whole give to the instruments of labour and the
- |2
                      product, as against the workman, is developed by means of machinery into a
- |2
                      thorough antagonism” (I, 432). Yet it is not only a question of
- |2
                      terminology: the content, too, of Capital is a
- |2
                      continuation of Marx's early thoughts. The main discussion of Volume
- |2
                      One of Capital rests on the equation of work and
- |2
                      value that goes back to the conception of man as a being who creates
- |2
                      himself and the conditions of his life—a con- ception outlined in the Paris
- |2
                          Manuscripts. It is man's nature, according to the Marx of the Paris Manuscripts, to be constantly developing, in
- |2
                      cooperation with other men, himself and the world about him. What Marx
- |2
                      in Capital is describing is how this fundamental
- |2
                      role of man, to be the initiator and controller of the histori- cal process, has been transferred, or
- |2
                      alienated, and how it belongs to the inhuman power of Capital.The counterpart of alienated man, the unalienated or
- |2
                      “total” man of the Manuscripts,
- |2
                      also appears inCapital. In the chapter of Volume One on
- |2
                      “Machinery and Modern Industry” Marx makes the same
- |2
                      contrast between the effects of alienated and unalienated modes of
- |2
                      production on the development of human poten-
- |2
                          tiality. He writes: “Modern industry, indeed, compels
- |2
                      society, under penalty of death, to replace the detail- worker of today, crippled by the life-long
- |2
                      repetition of one and the same trivial operation, and thus reduced to
- |2
                      the mere fragment of a man, by the fully developed individual, fit for a
- |2
                      variety of labours, ready to face any change of production, and to whom the
- |2
                      different social functions he performs, are but so many modes of
- |2
                      giving free scope to his own natural and acquired powers.” The
- |2
                      fact that, in Capital, the conclusion is supported
- |2
                      by a detailed analysis of the effects of ad-
- |2
                      vanced technology, should not obscure the continuity.The section of Capital that most recalls the early
- |2
                      writings, is the final section of Chapter One, entitled
- |2
                      “Fetishism of Commodities.” The whole section is
- |2
                      reminiscent of the passage on alienated labor in theA commodity is therefore a mysterious thing, simply because in it
- |2
                              the social character of man's labour appears to them as an
- |2
                              objective character stamped upon that labour; because the relation
- |2
                              of the producers to the sum total of their labour, is presented to
- |2
                              them as a social relation, existing not be-
- |2
                                  tween themselves, but between the products of their
- |2
                          labour
- |2
                          (I, 488).
- |2
                      However, the writing that best shows the centrality of the concept of
- |2
                      alienation to Marx's thought is theGrundrisse. This manuscript is the thousand-page
- |2
                      draft that served Marx as a basis for Capital but
- |2
                      remained unpublished until 1941. The Grundrisse, of
- |2
                      which theCritique of Political Economy and Capital are only partial elaborations, is the centerpiece of
- |2
                      Marx's work. It is the basic work which permitted the generaliza- tions in the famous Preface to the Critique of
- |2
                          Political Economy. For Capital is only the
- |2
                      first of the six volumes in which Marx wished to develop his Economics, the title by which he referred to his
- |2
                          magnum opus on the alienation of man
- |2
                      through Capital and the State.The scope of the Grundrisse being wider than that of
- |2
                          Capital, Marx's thought is best viewed as a con- tinuing meditation on themes begun in
- |2
                      1844, the high point in which meditation occurred in 1857-58. The
- |2
                      continuity between the Manuscripts and the Grundrisse is evident. Marx himself talked of the
- |2
                          Grundrisse as “the result of fifteen
- |2
                      years of research, thus the best period of my life.” This latter
- |2
                      was written in November 1858, exactly fifteen years after Marx's arrival in
- |2
                      Paris in November 1843. He also says, in the Preface
- |2
                      of 1859: “the total material lies before me in the form of mono- graphs, which were written at widely
- |2
                      separated pe- riods, for self-clarification, not
- |2
                      for publication, and whose coherent elaboration according to the plan indi- cated will depend on external
- |2
                      circumstances.” This can only refer to the Paris Manuscripts of 1844 and the London notebooks of 1850-52.
- |2
                      Marx constantly used, and at the same time revised, material from an
- |2
                      earlier date: for instance, he used his notebooks of 1843-45 while
- |2
                      writing Capital.The content of the Grundrisse only serves to confirm
- |2
                      what is plain from the external evidence: the beginning of the chapter on
- |2
                          Capital reproduces almost word for word the
- |2
                      passages in the Manuscripts on human need, man as a
- |2
                      species-being, the individual as a social being, the idea of nature as, in
- |2
                      a sense, man's body, the paral- lels between
- |2
                      religious and economic alienation, the utopian and almost millennial
- |2
                      elements, etc. One point in particular emphasizes this continuity: the Grundrisse are as Hegelian as the Paris Manuscripts and the central concept of both of them is
- |2
                      alienation.Aided by the publication of Marx's early writings,
- |2
                       the increasing complexity and anonymity of capitalist society,
- |2
                      and the gap between ideology and reality in many socialist ones, the
- |2
                      concept of alienation has be- come very topical.
- |2
                      Its very topicality, however, is in danger of rendering the concept of
- |2
                      alienation vacuous; for often it seems merely to be used to designate
- |2
                      any state of affairs that is considered unsatisfactory. How- ever, Marx's description of alienation, particularly
- |2
                      as contained in the Paris Manuscripts, is by no
- |2
                      means as vacuous as many of its contemporary interpretations. For it
- |2
                      contains both an account of the relationship between socioeconomic
- |2
                      conditions and psychological states that is, to some extent at least,
- |2
                      testable, and also a far from vague view of human nature. Because it
- |2
                      contains both of these it is also a concept in which facts and values are
- |2
                      inextricably bound together, and so one which runs counter to the
- |2
                      prevailing demand for a sharp distinction between evaluative and descrip- tive statements. Thus, although Marx
- |2
                      was always writ- ing with certain initial value
- |2
                      judgments presupposed, empirical criteria are, up to a point, applicable to
- |2
                      his hypotheses. Marx's concept can be further clarified by asking what
- |2
                      he would consider as nonalienation. This positive side of Marx's critique
- |2
                      is less well-known. But the passage on “alienated
- |2
                      labour” in the Paris Manu- scripts should be read in close conjunction with
- |2
                      his description of “production in a human manner”
- |2
                          con- tained in his notes on James Mill,
- |2
                      and with the concep- tion of the future
- |2
                      communist society outlined in theGrundrisse. The metaphysical and ethical elements of
- |2
                      the concept of alienation that originated with Hegel and Feuerbach still
- |2
                      persist to some extent in Marx, but they are given a socioeconomic context
- |2
                      that makes them all the more interesting to the modern mind.H. Arvon, Ludwig Feuerbach, ou la tranformation du

  \               ALIENATION IN HEGELAND MARX\n                Although its roots
  lie far back in the\n                    Judeo-Christian tradition, the concept
  of alienation first gained promi- nence in the philosophy of Hegel, and\n                    particularly
  in his mature writings. There are signs of the idea in\n                    his
  earlier works, but it is not until the Phenomenology (1808), thought by many to
  be Hegel's most\n                    important work, that alienation occupies a
  central place in his\n                    writings.\n                In the opening
  sections of the Phenomenology Hegel\n                    attacked the views of common
  sense and simplified natural science that the\n                    world consisted
  of discrete objects independent of man's consciousness.\n                    Truth,
  for Hegel, was not to be found in knowledge that was purified\n                    of
  any influence from man's own desires and feelings. Ultimately Hegel\n                    considered
  that there could be no truth that was not intimately linked with\n                    the
  ongoing process of human beings as thinking subjects; truth was\n                        their
  truth. The supposed objectivity of the\n                    world of nature was
  in fact an alienation, for man's task was to discover,\n                    behind
  these appearances, his own essential life and finally to view\n                    everything
  as a facet of his own self-consciousness. The same principle\n                        ap-
  plied to the world of culture in which\n                    such spheres as art
  and religion, if viewed as independent of man,\n                    constituted
  so many alienations to be overcome by integration into the\n                    final
  understanding and recapitula- tion\n                    which was Absolute Knowledge.\n
  \               \n                 The central actor in this process for Hegel was
  Spirit. Hegel thought that\n                    reality was Spirit developing itself.
  In this process Spirit produced a\n                    world that it thought at
  first was external; only later did it realize that\n                    this world
  was its own production. Spirit was not something separated\n                    from
  this productive activity; it only existed in and through this\n                    activity.
  At the beginning of this process Spirit was not aware that it was\n                    externalizing
  or alienating itself. Only gradually did Spirit realize\n                    that
  the world was not external to it. It was the failure to realize this\n                    that
  constituted, for Hegel, alienation. This alienation would cease when\n                    men
  became fully self-conscious and understood their environment and\n                    their
  culture to be emanations of Spirit. Freedom con- sisted in this understanding, and
  freedom was the aim\n                    of history.\n                Hegel had
  created a system; and all his disciples agreed that it was the\n                    final
  one. However, when it came to applying the system to particular\n                    problems,
  they conceived their Master's system to be ambivalent. The\n                    fact
  that alienation seemed to them to be a challenge, something to be\n                    overcome,
  led them to put the em- phasis on the\n                    concepts of dialectic
  and negativity in Hegel's system; and thus they\n                    challenged,
  first in reli- gion and then in\n                    politics, the Master's view
  that the problem of alienation had, at least in\n                    principle,
  been solved. The foremost among these radical disciples of\n                    Hegel,
  Bruno Bauer, applied the concept of alienation to the religious\n                    field.
  Bauer, who lectured in theology and made his name as a Gospel\n                    critic,
  considered that religious beliefs, and in particular Christianity,\n                    caused
  a division in man's consciousness by becoming opposed to this\n                    consciousness
  as a separate power. Thus religion was an attitude towards\n                    the
  essence of self-conscious- ness\n                    that had become estranged from
  itself. In this context, Bauer promoted the\n                    use of the expression
  “self-alienation” that soon\n                    became current among the Young
  Hegelians.\n                Like Bruno Bauer, Ludwig Feuerbach was also fas-\n                        cinated
  by the problem of religious alienation, but his concept\n                    of
  it was much simpler. Whereas Bauer con-\n                    sidered that men's
  religious creations eventually adopted an inhuman\n                    form, Feuerbach
  saw in religion simply the projection of man's essential\n                    desires
  and capacities. Since what was ascribed to God were really\n                    attributes
  of man, man was separated from himself, and thus alienated. This\n                    idea
  was elaborated in Feuerbach's best known book The\n                        Essence
  of Christianity, published in 1841. Feuerbach described\n                    the
  “fundamental idea” of his book thus:\n                    “The objective essence
  of religion, particularly the Christian\n                    religion, is nothing
  but the essence of human, and particularly Christian,\n                    feeling.
  The secret of theology is therefore anthropology.... The\n                    foundation
  of a new science is laid here in that038\n                     the philosophy of
  religion is conceived of and pre- sented as esoteric or secret anthropology or psychol-
  ogy” (McLellan [1969], p.\n                    88).\n                Feuerbach made
  an even greater impact through hisPreliminary Theses for the Reform of Philosophy
  and\n                    his Foundations of the Philosophy of the Future,\n                    both
  published in 1843. Their major purpose was to point out that\n                    Hegel's
  philosophy was just as alienating a force as religion and needed to\n                    be
  reabsorbed in the same manner. Feuerbach began his Theses with the statement “the
  secret of theology is\n                    anthropology, but the secret of speculative
  philosophy is\n                    theology” (ibid., p. 98). In Feuerbach's view,
  the great\n                    deficiency in Hegel's philosophy was its negation
  of theology\n                    “from the standpoint of theology.” Thus\n                    Hegel—the
  German Proclus—never managed to break out\n                    of the circle of
  ideas and could not realize the true relationship of\n                    thought
  to being: “being is the subject, thought the\n                    predicate.” As
  a philosopher in his own right, Feuer- bach was only of the second rank: basically
  he had\n                    one idea that he expounded in many different ways. As
  Marx said later:\n                    “Compared with Hegel, Feuerbach is very poor.
  Nevertheless,\n                    after Hegel he was epoch- making because he\n
  \                   put the emphasis on certain points, uncomfortable for the Christian\n
  \                   consciousness and im- portant for the progress\n                    of
  criticism, which Hegel had left in a sort of mystical twilight between\n                    clarity
  and obscurity” (ibid., p. 113).\n                It was in this atmosphere of rapid
  secularization that Marx evolved his own\n                    concept of alienation.
  Bruno Bauer had talked of alienation in religion;\n                    Feuerbach
  had carried this further by pointing out that Hegel's\n                    philosophy
  was itself the last bastion of theology; finally Moses\n                    Hess—nicknamed
  “the communist\n                    rabbi”—had transferred Feuerbach's ideas to
  the realm\n                    of economics, by analyzing, in his essay On the Essence\n
  \                       of Money (1844), money as the alienated essence of man.
  Marx\n                    accepted all these accounts of alienation, considering
  economics to be\n                    fundamental inasmuch as work was man's basic
  activity. In all these fields\n                    Marx's common idea was that man
  had alienated to someone or something\n                    what was essential to
  his nature— principally, to be in control\n                    of his own activities,
  to be the subject and initiator of the historical\n                    process.
  In the different forms of alienation some other entity had\n                    obtained
  what was proper to man: in religion it was God, in politics the\n                    State,
  in economics the market process and cash nexus. (A note is necessary\n                    on
  the German originals of the term “alienation.”\n                    Marx uses two
  words to express the concept of alienation:Entfremdung and Entäusserung. His distinction
  be-\n                    tween these two words is by no means as precise as that
  of Hegel.\n                    Often they appear to be synonymous and are used together
  for rhetorical\n                    effect. If anything,Entfremdung conveys the
  sense of alienation in which\n                     two people are said to be alienated
  from each other; while Entässerung has more the sense of\n                    “making
  external to oneself” with legal and\n                    commercial over- tones.
  Neither of these words\n                    is to be confused withVergegenständlichung,
  that is,\n                    “objectification,” which, in Marx as opposed to\n
  \                   Hegel, is a neutral process that can be either good or bad according
  to the\n                        partic- ular circumstances.)\n                Marx
  first worked out his ideas in detail with regard to political\n                    alienation
  in his Critique of Hegel's Philos- ophy of Right. Here Marx examined paragraph\n
  \                   by paragraph Hegel's Philosophy of Right and\n                    claimed
  that the state, described by Hegel as productive of, and\n                    superior
  to, its own elements, constituted an aliena- tion of man's essence. Applying to
  Hegel\n                    Feuerbach's reversal of subject and predicate, Marx wrote:\n
  \                   “The Idea is made subjective and the true relationship of\n
  \                   the family and civil society to the state is conceived of as
  their\n                    imaginary activity. The family and civil society are
  the presuppositions of\n                    the state; they are its properly active
  elements. But in speculation\n                    the relationship is inverted.
  When the Idea is made a subject, the\n                    civil society, the family,
  'circumstances, caprice' etc. become unreal\n                    objective phrases
  of the Idea and have a completely different\n                    significance” (Early
  Texts, p. 62).\n                The place where Marx wrote at greatst length on
  his concept of alienation\n                    and his debt to Hegel are two passages
  in the Paris\n                        Manuscripts. In the passage on “alienated\n
  \                   labour” (ibid., pp. 133ff.), Marx deals with the relationship
  of\n                    the worker to his product. The fact that the worker is related
  to the\n                    product of his labor as to an alien object means that
  the more the\n                    worker produces the more he approaches loss of
  work and starvation. Marx\n                    goes on to detail four types of alienated
  labor: the alienation of the\n                    product from the producer; the
  alienation of the act of production;\n                    the alienation of nature
  from men; and finally of man from his\n                    species-being (a term
  borrowed from Feuerbach meaning the common factors\n                    making up
  man's nature). This negative picture is complemented by the descrip- tion that Marx
  gives of unalienated\n                    man in the notes that he made on James
  Mill at the same time as the\n                    writing of the Manuscripts. Put
  rather roughly, what\n                    Marx means when he talks of alienation
  is this: it is man's nature to be\n                    his own creator; he forms
  and develops himself by working on and\n                    transforming the world
  outside him in cooperation with his fellow men.\n                    In this progressive
  interchange between man and the world, it is man's\n                    nature to
  be in control of this process, to be the initiator, the subject\n                    in
  which the process originates. However, this nature has become alien\n                    to
  man; that is, it is no longer his and belongs to another person or\n                    thing.
  In religion, for example, it is God who is the subject of the\n                    historical
  process and man is in039\n                     a state of dependence on His grace.
  In economics, according to\n                    Marx, it is money and the processes
  of the market that maneuver men around\n                    instead of being controlled
  by them. The central point is that man has\n                    lost control of
  his own evolution and has seen this control invested in\n                    other
  entities. What is proper to man has become the attribute of something\n                    else,
  and thus alien to him.\n                The second passage of importance in the
  Paris Man- uscripts is the final section\n                    entitled Critique
  of Hegel's Dialectic (ibid., pp.\n                    157ff.). Here Marx began by
  de- scribing\n                    Feuerbach's “great achievement” which was to have\n
  \                   demonstrated that Hegel's philosophy was merely a different
  form of the\n                    alienation of man's nature; Feuerbach had reestablished
  the primacy of\n                    man's social relationship to man. Marx readily
  ac-\n                        knowledged his own debt to Hegel. “Therefore the\n
  \                   greatness of Hegel's Phenomenology,” he wrote,\n                    “and
  its final product, the dialectic of negativity as the\n                    moving
  and creating principle, is that Hegel conceived of the self-creation\n                    of
  man as a process, objectification as loss of the object, as\n                    externalisation
  and the tran- scendence of\n                    this externalisation. This means,
  therefore, that he grasps the nature of\n                    labour and understands
  objective man, true, because real man, as the\n                    result of his
  own labour” (ibid., p. 164). Nevertheless,\n                    Hegel's conception
  of labor was of abstract, mental labor and he only\n                    succeeded
  in overcoming alienation in the realm of consciousness.\n                Although
  Hegel said that man suffered from eco-\n                    nomic and political
  alienation, it was only the thought of economics\n                    and politics
  in which Hegel was inter- ested.\n                    The whole process ended in
  Absolute Knowl-\n                    edge, with the result that it was the philosopher
  who judged the\n                    world. In other words, Hegel had confused alienation
  and objectivity. Thus,\n                    according to Hegel, “What is supposed
  to be the essence of\n                    alienation that needs to be transcended
  is not that man's being ob- jectifies itself in an inhuman way in\n                    opposition
  to itself, but that it objectifies itself in distinction from\n                    and
  in opposition to, abstract thought. The appropriation of man's\n                    objectified
  and alienated faculties is thus firstly only an appropriation\n                    that
  occurs in the mind, in pure thought, i.e. in abstraction”\n                    (ibid.,
  pp. 162f.). Marx's central criticism of Hegel, therefore, was that\n                        aliena-
  tion would not cease with the\n                    supposed abolition of the external
  world. The external world, according\n                    to Marx, was part of man's
  nature and the point was to establish the\n                    right relationship
  between man and his environment. Marx therefore rejected\n                    Hegel's
  notion of Spirit and replaced its supposed antithesis to the\n                    external
  world by the antithesis between man and his social being.\n                In his
  early writings, therefore, Marx sketched a notion of alienation\n                    which,
  taking the analyses in reli\n                    gion and politics of his contemporary
  Young Hegelians as models,\n                    had its roots in the socioeconomic
  situation of the worker in capitalist\n                    society. Yet in the 1930's
  and '40's, alienation did not play any part in\n                    the many discussions
  of Marx's thought. In the 1960's, however, it was\n                    accepted
  that it is the major theme running through\n                    the whole of his
  writings. Those who wish to maintain that there is a break\n                    between
  the “young” and the\n                    “old” Marx usually maintain that alienation
  is a\n                    concept that was entirely restricted to Marx's early thought
  and later\n                    abandoned. However, these state- ments can be\n                    shown
  to be incorrect.\n                The term itself occurs much more frequently, even
  in Capital, than is commonly realized. In Capital\n                    Marx writes,
  for example: “The character of independence\n                    and estrangement
  which the capitalist modes of pro-\n                        duction as a whole give
  to the instruments of labour and the\n                    product, as against the
  workman, is developed by means of machinery into a\n                    thorough
  antagonism” (I, 432). Yet it is not only a question of\n                    terminology:
  the content, too, of Capital is a\n                    continuation of Marx's early
  thoughts. The main discussion of Volume\n                    One of Capital rests
  on the equation of work and\n                    value that goes back to the conception
  of man as a being who creates\n                    himself and the conditions of
  his life—a con- ception outlined in the Paris\n                        Manuscripts.
  It is man's nature, according to the Marx of the Paris Manuscripts, to be constantly
  developing, in\n                    cooperation with other men, himself and the
  world about him. What Marx\n                    in Capital is describing is how
  this fundamental\n                    role of man, to be the initiator and controller
  of the histori- cal process, has been transferred, or\n                    alienated,
  and how it belongs to the inhuman power of Capital.\n                The counterpart
  of alienated man, the unalienated or\n                    “total” man of the Manuscripts,\n
  \                   also appears inCapital. In the chapter of Volume One on\n                    “Machinery
  and Modern Industry” Marx makes the same\n                    contrast between the
  effects of alienated and unalienated modes of\n                    production on
  the development of human poten-\n                        tiality. He writes: “Modern
  industry, indeed, compels\n                    society, under penalty of death,
  to replace the detail- worker of today, crippled by the life-long\n                    repetition
  of one and the same trivial operation, and thus reduced to\n                    the
  mere fragment of a man, by the fully developed individual, fit for a\n                    variety
  of labours, ready to face any change of production, and to whom the\n                    different
  social functions he performs, are but so many modes of\n                    giving
  free scope to his own natural and acquired powers.” The\n                    fact
  that, in Capital, the conclusion is supported\n                    by a detailed
  analysis of the effects of ad-\n                    vanced technology, should not
  obscure the continuity.\n                The section of Capital that most recalls
  the early\n                    writings, is the final section of Chapter One, entitled\n
  \                   “Fetishism of Commodities.” The whole section is\n                    reminiscent
  of the passage on alienated labor in the040\n                    \n                    Paris
  Manuscripts and of the notes on James Mill\n                    that Marx composed
  in 1844. Marx writes:\n                \n                    \n                        A
  commodity is therefore a mysterious thing, simply because in it\n                            the
  social character of man's labour appears to them as an\n                            objective
  character stamped upon that labour; because the relation\n                            of
  the producers to the sum total of their labour, is presented to\n                            them
  as a social relation, existing not be-\n                                tween themselves,
  but between the products of their\n                        labour\n                    \n

  \               \n                However, the writing that best shows the centrality
  of the concept of\n                    alienation to Marx's thought is theGrundrisse.
  This manuscript is the thousand-page\n                    draft that served Marx
  as a basis for Capital but\n                    remained unpublished until 1941.
  The Grundrisse, of\n                    which theCritique of Political Economy and
  Capital are only partial elaborations, is the centerpiece of\n                    Marx's
  work. It is the basic work which permitted the generaliza- tions in the famous Preface
  to the Critique of\n                        Political Economy. For Capital is only
  the\n                    first of the six volumes in which Marx wished to develop
  his Economics, the title by which he referred to his\n                        magnum
  opus on the alienation of man\n                    through Capital and the State.\n
  \               The scope of the Grundrisse being wider than that of\n                        Capital,
  Marx's thought is best viewed as a con- tinuing meditation on themes begun in\n
  \                   1844, the high point in which meditation occurred in 1857-58.
  The\n                    continuity between the Manuscripts and the Grundrisse is
  evident. Marx himself talked of the\n                        Grundrisse as “the
  result of fifteen\n                    years of research, thus the best period of
  my life.” This latter\n                    was written in November 1858, exactly
  fifteen years after Marx's arrival in\n                    Paris in November 1843.
  He also says, in the Preface\n                    of 1859: “the total material lies
  before me in the form of mono- graphs, which were written at widely\n                    separated
  pe- riods, for self-clarification, not\n                    for publication, and
  whose coherent elaboration according to the plan indi- cated will depend on external\n
  \                   circumstances.” This can only refer to the Paris Manuscripts
  of 1844 and the London notebooks of 1850-52.\n                    Marx constantly
  used, and at the same time revised, material from an\n                    earlier
  date: for instance, he used his notebooks of 1843-45 while\n                    writing
  Capital.\n                The content of the Grundrisse only serves to confirm\n
  \                   what is plain from the external evidence: the beginning of the
  chapter on\n                        Capital reproduces almost word for word the\n
  \                   passages in the Manuscripts on human need, man as a\n                    species-being,
  the individual as a social being, the idea of nature as, in\n                    a
  sense, man's body, the paral- lels between\n                    religious and economic
  alienation, the utopian and almost millennial\n                    elements, etc.
  One point in particular emphasizes this continuity: the Grundrisse are as Hegelian
  as the Paris Manuscripts and the central concept of both of them is\n                    alienation.\n
  \               Aided by the publication of Marx's early writings,\n                     the
  increasing complexity and anonymity of capitalist society,\n                    and
  the gap between ideology and reality in many socialist ones, the\n                    concept
  of alienation has be- come very topical.\n                    Its very topicality,
  however, is in danger of rendering the concept of\n                    alienation
  vacuous; for often it seems merely to be used to designate\n                    any
  state of affairs that is considered unsatisfactory. How- ever, Marx's description
  of alienation, particularly\n                    as contained in the Paris Manuscripts,
  is by no\n                    means as vacuous as many of its contemporary interpretations.
  For it\n                    contains both an account of the relationship between
  socioeconomic\n                    conditions and psychological states that is,
  to some extent at least,\n                    testable, and also a far from vague
  view of human nature. Because it\n                    contains both of these it
  is also a concept in which facts and values are\n                    inextricably
  bound together, and so one which runs counter to the\n                    prevailing
  demand for a sharp distinction between evaluative and descrip- tive statements.
  Thus, although Marx\n                    was always writ- ing with certain initial
  value\n                    judgments presupposed, empirical criteria are, up to
  a point, applicable to\n                    his hypotheses. Marx's concept can be
  further clarified by asking what\n                    he would consider as nonalienation.
  This positive side of Marx's critique\n                    is less well-known. But
  the passage on “alienated\n                    labour” in the Paris Manu- scripts
  should be read in close conjunction with\n                    his description of
  “production in a human manner”\n                        con- tained in his notes
  on James Mill,\n                    and with the concep- tion of the future\n                    communist
  society outlined in theGrundrisse. The metaphysical and ethical elements of\n                    the
  concept of alienation that originated with Hegel and Feuerbach still\n                    persist
  to some extent in Marx, but they are given a socioeconomic context\n                    that
  makes them all the more interesting to the modern mind.\n                \n                    \n

  \            Dictionary of the History of IdeasAlthough its roots lie far back in
  the\n                    Judeo-Christian tradition, the concept of alienation first
  gained promi- nence in the philosophy of Hegel, and\n                    particularly
  in his mature writings. There are signs of the idea in\n                    his
  earlier works, but it is not until the Phenomenology (1808), thought by many to
  be Hegel's most\n                    important work, that alienation occupies a
  central place in his\n                    writings.In the opening sections of the
  Phenomenology Hegel\n                    attacked the views of common sense and
  simplified natural science that the\n                    world consisted of discrete
  objects independent of man's consciousness.\n                    Truth, for Hegel,
  was not to be found in knowledge that was purified\n                    of any influence
  from man's own desires and feelings. Ultimately Hegel\n                    considered
  that there could be no truth that was not intimately linked with\n                    the
  ongoing process of human beings as thinking subjects; truth was\n                        their
  truth. The supposed objectivity of the\n                    world of nature was
  in fact an alienation, for man's task was to discover,\n                    behind
  these appearances, his own essential life and finally to view\n                    everything
  as a facet of his own self-consciousness. The same principle\n                        ap-
  plied to the world of culture in which\n                    such spheres as art
  and religion, if viewed as independent of man,\n                    constituted
  so many alienations to be overcome by integration into the\n                    final
  understanding and recapitula- tion\n                    which was Absolute Knowledge.
  The central actor in this process for Hegel was Spirit. Hegel thought that\n                    reality
  was Spirit developing itself. In this process Spirit produced a\n                    world
  that it thought at first was external; only later did it realize that\n                    this
  world was its own production. Spirit was not something separated\n                    from
  this productive activity; it only existed in and through this\n                    activity.
  At the beginning of this process Spirit was not aware that it was\n                    externalizing
  or alienating itself. Only gradually did Spirit realize\n                    that
  the world was not external to it. It was the failure to realize this\n                    that
  constituted, for Hegel, alienation. This alienation would cease when\n                    men
  became fully self-conscious and understood their environment and\n                    their
  culture to be emanations of Spirit. Freedom con- sisted in this understanding, and
  freedom was the aim\n                    of history.Hegel had created a system;
  and all his disciples agreed that it was the\n                    final one. However,
  when it came to applying the system to particular\n                    problems,
  they conceived their Master's system to be ambivalent. The\n                    fact
  that alienation seemed to them to be a challenge, something to be\n                    overcome,
  led them to put the em- phasis on the\n                    concepts of dialectic
  and negativity in Hegel's system; and thus they\n                    challenged,
  first in reli- gion and then in\n                    politics, the Master's view
  that the problem of alienation had, at least in\n                    principle,
  been solved. The foremost among these radical disciples of\n                    Hegel,
  Bruno Bauer, applied the concept of alienation to the religious\n                    field.
  Bauer, who lectured in theology and made his name as a Gospel\n                    critic,
  considered that religious beliefs, and in particular Christianity,\n                    caused
  a division in man's consciousness by becoming opposed to this\n                    consciousness
  as a separate power. Thus religion was an attitude towards\n                    the
  essence of self-conscious- ness\n                    that had become estranged from
  itself. In this context, Bauer promoted the\n                    use of the expression
  “self-alienation” that soon\n                    became current among the Young
  Hegelians.Like Bruno Bauer, Ludwig Feuerbach was also fas-\n                        cinated
  by the problem of religious alienation, but his concept\n                    of
  it was much simpler. Whereas Bauer con-\n                    sidered that men's
  religious creations eventually adopted an inhuman\n                    form, Feuerbach
  saw in religion simply the projection of man's essential\n                    desires
  and capacities. Since what was ascribed to God were really\n                    attributes
  of man, man was separated from himself, and thus alienated. This\n                    idea
  was elaborated in Feuerbach's best known book The\n                        Essence
  of Christianity, published in 1841. Feuerbach described\n                    the
  “fundamental idea” of his book thus:\n                    “The objective essence
  of religion, particularly the Christian\n                    religion, is nothing
  but the essence of human, and particularly Christian,\n                    feeling.
  The secret of theology is therefore anthropology.... The\n                    foundation
  of a new science is laid here in thatFeuerbach made an even greater impact through
  hisPreliminary Theses for the Reform of Philosophy and\n                    his
  Foundations of the Philosophy of the Future,\n                    both published
  in 1843. Their major purpose was to point out that\n                    Hegel's
  philosophy was just as alienating a force as religion and needed to\n                    be
  reabsorbed in the same manner. Feuerbach began his Theses with the statement “the
  secret of theology is\n                    anthropology, but the secret of speculative
  philosophy is\n                    theology” (ibid., p. 98). In Feuerbach's view,
  the great\n                    deficiency in Hegel's philosophy was its negation
  of theology\n                    “from the standpoint of theology.” Thus\n                    Hegel—the
  German Proclus—never managed to break out\n                    of the circle of
  ideas and could not realize the true relationship of\n                    thought
  to being: “being is the subject, thought the\n                    predicate.” As
  a philosopher in his own right, Feuer- bach was only of the second rank: basically
  he had\n                    one idea that he expounded in many different ways. As
  Marx said later:\n                    “Compared with Hegel, Feuerbach is very poor.
  Nevertheless,\n                    after Hegel he was epoch- making because he\n
  \                   put the emphasis on certain points, uncomfortable for the Christian\n
  \                   consciousness and im- portant for the progress\n                    of
  criticism, which Hegel had left in a sort of mystical twilight between\n                    clarity
  and obscurity” (ibid., p. 113).It was in this atmosphere of rapid secularization
  that Marx evolved his own\n                    concept of alienation. Bruno Bauer
  had talked of alienation in religion;\n                    Feuerbach had carried
  this further by pointing out that Hegel's\n                    philosophy was itself
  the last bastion of theology; finally Moses\n                    Hess—nicknamed
  “the communist\n                    rabbi”—had transferred Feuerbach's ideas to
  the realm\n                    of economics, by analyzing, in his essay On the Essence\n
  \                       of Money (1844), money as the alienated essence of man.
  Marx\n                    accepted all these accounts of alienation, considering
  economics to be\n                    fundamental inasmuch as work was man's basic
  activity. In all these fields\n                    Marx's common idea was that man
  had alienated to someone or something\n                    what was essential to
  his nature— principally, to be in control\n                    of his own activities,
  to be the subject and initiator of the historical\n                    process.
  In the different forms of alienation some other entity had\n                    obtained
  what was proper to man: in religion it was God, in politics the\n                    State,
  in economics the market process and cash nexus. (A note is necessary\n                    on
  the German originals of the term “alienation.”\n                    Marx uses two
  words to express the concept of alienation:Entfremdung and Entäusserung. His distinction
  be-\n                    tween these two words is by no means as precise as that
  of Hegel.\n                    Often they appear to be synonymous and are used together
  for rhetorical\n                    effect. If anything,Entfremdung conveys the
  sense of alienation in which\n                     two people are said to be alienated
  from each other; while Entässerung has more the sense of\n                    “making
  external to oneself” with legal and\n                    commercial over- tones.
  Neither of these words\n                    is to be confused withVergegenständlichung,
  that is,\n                    “objectification,” which, in Marx as opposed to\n
  \                   Hegel, is a neutral process that can be either good or bad according
  to the\n                        partic- ular circumstances.)Marx first worked out
  his ideas in detail with regard to political\n                    alienation in
  his Critique of Hegel's Philos- ophy of Right. Here Marx examined paragraph\n                    by
  paragraph Hegel's Philosophy of Right and\n                    claimed that the
  state, described by Hegel as productive of, and\n                    superior to,
  its own elements, constituted an aliena- tion of man's essence. Applying to Hegel\n
  \                   Feuerbach's reversal of subject and predicate, Marx wrote:\n
  \                   “The Idea is made subjective and the true relationship of\n
  \                   the family and civil society to the state is conceived of as
  their\n                    imaginary activity. The family and civil society are
  the presuppositions of\n                    the state; they are its properly active
  elements. But in speculation\n                    the relationship is inverted.
  When the Idea is made a subject, the\n                    civil society, the family,
  'circumstances, caprice' etc. become unreal\n                    objective phrases
  of the Idea and have a completely different\n                    significance” (Early
  Texts, p. 62).The place where Marx wrote at greatst length on his concept of alienation\n
  \                   and his debt to Hegel are two passages in the Paris\n                        Manuscripts.
  In the passage on “alienated\n                    labour” (ibid., pp. 133ff.), Marx
  deals with the relationship of\n                    the worker to his product. The
  fact that the worker is related to the\n                    product of his labor
  as to an alien object means that the more the\n                    worker produces
  the more he approaches loss of work and starvation. Marx\n                    goes
  on to detail four types of alienated labor: the alienation of the\n                    product
  from the producer; the alienation of the act of production;\n                    the
  alienation of nature from men; and finally of man from his\n                    species-being
  (a term borrowed from Feuerbach meaning the common factors\n                    making
  up man's nature). This negative picture is complemented by the descrip- tion that
  Marx gives of unalienated\n                    man in the notes that he made on
  James Mill at the same time as the\n                    writing of the Manuscripts.
  Put rather roughly, what\n                    Marx means when he talks of alienation
  is this: it is man's nature to be\n                    his own creator; he forms
  and develops himself by working on and\n                    transforming the world
  outside him in cooperation with his fellow men.\n                    In this progressive
  interchange between man and the world, it is man's\n                    nature to
  be in control of this process, to be the initiator, the subject\n                    in
  which the process originates. However, this nature has become alien\n                    to
  man; that is, it is no longer his and belongs to another person or\n                    thing.
  In religion, for example, it is God who is the subject of the\n                    historical
  process and man is inThe second passage of importance in the Paris Man- uscripts
  is the final section\n                    entitled Critique of Hegel's Dialectic
  (ibid., pp.\n                    157ff.). Here Marx began by de- scribing\n                    Feuerbach's
  “great achievement” which was to have\n                    demonstrated that Hegel's
  philosophy was merely a different form of the\n                    alienation of
  man's nature; Feuerbach had reestablished the primacy of\n                    man's
  social relationship to man. Marx readily ac-\n                        knowledged
  his own debt to Hegel. “Therefore the\n                    greatness of Hegel's
  Phenomenology,” he wrote,\n                    “and its final product, the dialectic
  of negativity as the\n                    moving and creating principle, is that
  Hegel conceived of the self-creation\n                    of man as a process, objectification
  as loss of the object, as\n                    externalisation and the tran- scendence
  of\n                    this externalisation. This means, therefore, that he grasps
  the nature of\n                    labour and understands objective man, true, because
  real man, as the\n                    result of his own labour” (ibid., p. 164).
  Nevertheless,\n                    Hegel's conception of labor was of abstract,
  mental labor and he only\n                    succeeded in overcoming alienation
  in the realm of consciousness.Although Hegel said that man suffered from eco-\n
  \                   nomic and political alienation, it was only the thought of economics\n
  \                   and politics in which Hegel was inter- ested.\n                    The
  whole process ended in Absolute Knowl-\n                    edge, with the result
  that it was the philosopher who judged the\n                    world. In other
  words, Hegel had confused alienation and objectivity. Thus,\n                    according
  to Hegel, “What is supposed to be the essence of\n                    alienation
  that needs to be transcended is not that man's being ob- jectifies itself in an
  inhuman way in\n                    opposition to itself, but that it objectifies
  itself in distinction from\n                    and in opposition to, abstract thought.
  The appropriation of man's\n                    objectified and alienated faculties
  is thus firstly only an appropriation\n                    that occurs in the mind,
  in pure thought, i.e. in abstraction”\n                    (ibid., pp. 162f.). Marx's
  central criticism of Hegel, therefore, was that\n                        aliena-
  tion would not cease with the\n                    supposed abolition of the external
  world. The external world, according\n                    to Marx, was part of man's
  nature and the point was to establish the\n                    right relationship
  between man and his environment. Marx therefore rejected\n                    Hegel's
  notion of Spirit and replaced its supposed antithesis to the\n                    external
  world by the antithesis between man and his social being.In his early writings,
  therefore, Marx sketched a notion of alienation\n                    which, taking
  the analyses in reli\n                    gion and politics of his contemporary
  Young Hegelians as models,\n                    had its roots in the socioeconomic
  situation of the worker in capitalist\n                    society. Yet in the 1930's
  and '40's, alienation did not play any part in\n                    the many discussions
  of Marx's thought. In the 1960's, however, it was\n                    accepted
  that it is the major theme running through\n                    the whole of his
  writings. Those who wish to maintain that there is a break\n                    between
  the “young” and the\n                    “old” Marx usually maintain that alienation
  is a\n                    concept that was entirely restricted to Marx's early thought
  and later\n                    abandoned. However, these state- ments can be\n                    shown
  to be incorrect.The term itself occurs much more frequently, even in Capital, than
  is commonly realized. In Capital\n                    Marx writes, for example:
  “The character of independence\n                    and estrangement which the capitalist
  modes of pro-\n                        duction as a whole give to the instruments
  of labour and the\n                    product, as against the workman, is developed
  by means of machinery into a\n                    thorough antagonism” (I, 432).
  Yet it is not only a question of\n                    terminology: the content,
  too, of Capital is a\n                    continuation of Marx's early thoughts.
  The main discussion of Volume\n                    One of Capital rests on the equation
  of work and\n                    value that goes back to the conception of man as
  a being who creates\n                    himself and the conditions of his life—a
  con- ception outlined in the Paris\n                        Manuscripts. It is man's
  nature, according to the Marx of the Paris Manuscripts, to be constantly developing,
  in\n                    cooperation with other men, himself and the world about
  him. What Marx\n                    in Capital is describing is how this fundamental\n
  \                   role of man, to be the initiator and controller of the histori-
  cal process, has been transferred, or\n                    alienated, and how it
  belongs to the inhuman power of Capital.The counterpart of alienated man, the unalienated
  or\n                    “total” man of the Manuscripts,\n                    also
  appears inCapital. In the chapter of Volume One on\n                    “Machinery
  and Modern Industry” Marx makes the same\n                    contrast between the
  effects of alienated and unalienated modes of\n                    production on
  the development of human poten-\n                        tiality. He writes: “Modern
  industry, indeed, compels\n                    society, under penalty of death,
  to replace the detail- worker of today, crippled by the life-long\n                    repetition
  of one and the same trivial operation, and thus reduced to\n                    the
  mere fragment of a man, by the fully developed individual, fit for a\n                    variety
  of labours, ready to face any change of production, and to whom the\n                    different
  social functions he performs, are but so many modes of\n                    giving
  free scope to his own natural and acquired powers.” The\n                    fact
  that, in Capital, the conclusion is supported\n                    by a detailed
  analysis of the effects of ad-\n                    vanced technology, should not
  obscure the continuity.The section of Capital that most recalls the early\n                    writings,
  is the final section of Chapter One, entitled\n                    “Fetishism of
  Commodities.” The whole section is\n                    reminiscent of the passage
  on alienated labor in theA commodity is therefore a mysterious thing, simply because
  in it\n                            the social character of man's labour appears
  to them as an\n                            objective character stamped upon that
  labour; because the relation\n                            of the producers to the
  sum total of their labour, is presented to\n                            them as
  a social relation, existing not be-\n                                tween themselves,
  but between the products of their\n                        labour\n                        (I,
  488).\n                    However, the writing that best shows the centrality of
  the concept of\n                    alienation to Marx's thought is theGrundrisse.
  This manuscript is the thousand-page\n                    draft that served Marx
  as a basis for Capital but\n                    remained unpublished until 1941.
  The Grundrisse, of\n                    which theCritique of Political Economy and
  Capital are only partial elaborations, is the centerpiece of\n                    Marx's
  work. It is the basic work which permitted the generaliza- tions in the famous Preface
  to the Critique of\n                        Political Economy. For Capital is only
  the\n                    first of the six volumes in which Marx wished to develop
  his Economics, the title by which he referred to his\n                        magnum
  opus on the alienation of man\n                    through Capital and the State.The
  scope of the Grundrisse being wider than that of\n                        Capital,
  Marx's thought is best viewed as a con- tinuing meditation on themes begun in\n
  \                   1844, the high point in which meditation occurred in 1857-58.
  The\n                    continuity between the Manuscripts and the Grundrisse is
  evident. Marx himself talked of the\n                        Grundrisse as “the
  result of fifteen\n                    years of research, thus the best period of
  my life.” This latter\n                    was written in November 1858, exactly
  fifteen years after Marx's arrival in\n                    Paris in November 1843.
  He also says, in the Preface\n                    of 1859: “the total material lies
  before me in the form of mono- graphs, which were written at widely\n                    separated
  pe- riods, for self-clarification, not\n                    for publication, and
  whose coherent elaboration according to the plan indi- cated will depend on external\n
  \                   circumstances.” This can only refer to the Paris Manuscripts
  of 1844 and the London notebooks of 1850-52.\n                    Marx constantly
  used, and at the same time revised, material from an\n                    earlier
  date: for instance, he used his notebooks of 1843-45 while\n                    writing
  Capital.The content of the Grundrisse only serves to confirm\n                    what
  is plain from the external evidence: the beginning of the chapter on\n                        Capital
  reproduces almost word for word the\n                    passages in the Manuscripts
  on human need, man as a\n                    species-being, the individual as a
  social being, the idea of nature as, in\n                    a sense, man's body,
  the paral- lels between\n                    religious and economic alienation,
  the utopian and almost millennial\n                    elements, etc. One point
  in particular emphasizes this continuity: the Grundrisse are as Hegelian as the
  Paris Manuscripts and the central concept of both of them is\n                    alienation.Aided
  by the publication of Marx's early writings,\n                     the increasing
  complexity and anonymity of capitalist society,\n                    and the gap
  between ideology and reality in many socialist ones, the\n                    concept
  of alienation has be- come very topical.\n                    Its very topicality,
  however, is in danger of rendering the concept of\n                    alienation
  vacuous; for often it seems merely to be used to designate\n                    any
  state of affairs that is considered unsatisfactory. How- ever, Marx's description
  of alienation, particularly\n                    as contained in the Paris Manuscripts,
  is by no\n                    means as vacuous as many of its contemporary interpretations.
  For it\n                    contains both an account of the relationship between
  socioeconomic\n                    conditions and psychological states that is,
  to some extent at least,\n                    testable, and also a far from vague
  view of human nature. Because it\n                    contains both of these it
  is also a concept in which facts and values are\n                    inextricably
  bound together, and so one which runs counter to the\n                    prevailing
  demand for a sharp distinction between evaluative and descrip- tive statements.
  Thus, although Marx\n                    was always writ- ing with certain initial
  value\n                    judgments presupposed, empirical criteria are, up to
  a point, applicable to\n                    his hypotheses. Marx's concept can be
  further clarified by asking what\n                    he would consider as nonalienation.
  This positive side of Marx's critique\n                    is less well-known. But
  the passage on “alienated\n                    labour” in the Paris Manu- scripts
  should be read in close conjunction with\n                    his description of
  “production in a human manner”\n                        con- tained in his notes
  on James Mill,\n                    and with the concep- tion of the future\n                    communist
  society outlined in theGrundrisse. The metaphysical and ethical elements of\n                    the
  concept of alienation that originated with Hegel and Feuerbach still\n                    persist
  to some extent in Marx, but they are given a socioeconomic context\n                    that
  makes them all the more interesting to the modern mind.H. Arvon, Ludwig Feuerbach,
