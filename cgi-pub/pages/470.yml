                  Officials are alarmed by the scale of safety risk posed by drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). A study released by Bard College Friday noted 921 incidents involving drones and manned aircraft in U.S. airspace between Dec. 17, 2013, and Sept. 12, 2015.

                  “Safety is always the FAA's top priority, and we are concerned about the increasing number of instances where pilots have reported seeing unmanned aircraft flying nearby,” said FAA Deputy Administrator Mike Whitaker, in testimony before the House Aviation Subcommittee.

                  The FAA explained that CACI’s prototype sensor-based detection system will be evaluated at airports selected by the agency. Specific details of how the system will work have not yet been released by the FAA, although it will reportedly use radio signals to detect and tackle drone threats.

                  Arlington, Va.-based CACI referred a FoxNews.com request for comment to the FAA. The company, however, recently launched its SkyTracker system, which creates an electronic boundary around sensitive locations, such as airports.

                  The system uses UAS radio links to identify and locate drones flying in banned or protected airspace, according to CACI, and can also locate the drone’s operator. “The CACI system triangulates the position of misused UAS for accurate geolocation and tracking, while differentiating them from other UAS in the same area,” explains CACI, in a statement on its website.

                  Missy Cummings, associate professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science at Duke University, warns that developing effective anti-drone technology is a difficult task. “Tracking small airborne objects that are slow moving close to the ground is notoriously difficult with significant signal-to-noise ratio problems,” she told FoxNews.com, via email. “No system will be perfect and how to guard against interlopers, even if you could track them is, of course, another issue -- you can’t jam all GPS signals, for example, in an airport area because it would affect the planes trying to land and take off.”

                  On Monday the agency also announced new regulations requiring drone registration in an effort to keep track of soaring ownership. The online registration would apply to owners of small drones weighing more than 0.55 pounds and less than 55 pounds, including payloads such as on-board cameras, according to a statement.

                  The FAA’s progress around commercial drones has been a source of frustration for many companies. Amazon, for example, has been a vocal critic of the pace of regulatory efforts for commercial drones. Last year the retail giant threatened to move more of its drone development work outside of America unless the FAA relaxed its rules.

- "\t                Faced with a growing drone threat to aircraft, the Federal Aviation
  Administration has teamed up with IT specialist CACI International in an attempt
  to protect the airspace around airports.Officials are alarmed by the scale of safety
  risk posed by drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). A study released
  by Bard College Friday noted 921 incidents involving drones and manned aircraft
  in U.S. airspace between Dec. 17, 2013, and Sept. 12, 2015.In October, as part of
  the FAA’s Pathfinder program, the agency signed an agreement to evaluate CACI’s
  technology within a 5-mile radius of airports.Related: The laser cannon that kills
  drones“Safety is always the FAA's top priority, and we are concerned about the increasing
  number of instances where pilots have reported seeing unmanned aircraft flying nearby,”
  said FAA Deputy Administrator Mike Whitaker, in testimony before the House Aviation
  Subcommittee.The FAA explained that CACI’s prototype sensor-based detection system
  will be evaluated at airports selected by the agency. Specific details of how the
  system will work have not yet been released by the FAA, although it will reportedly
  use radio signals to detect and tackle drone threats.Arlington, Va.-based CACI referred
  a FoxNews.com request for comment to the FAA. The company, however, recently launched
  its SkyTracker system, which creates an electronic boundary around sensitive locations,
  such as airports.Related: Amazon shows off drone delivery prototypesThe system uses
  UAS radio links to identify and locate drones flying in banned or protected airspace,
  according to CACI, and can also locate the drone’s operator. “The CACI system triangulates
  the position of misused UAS for accurate geolocation and tracking, while differentiating
  them from other UAS in the same area,” explains CACI, in a statement on its website.CACI
  says that SkyTracker can also “initiate countermeasures,” effectively stopping specific
  drones.The FAA is also reportedly looking at geo-fencing, a system that uses GPS
  and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to limit where unmanned aircraft
  can fly as it attempts to protect aircraft.Related: 'Bird' gadget lets you control
  a drone with your fingerMissy Cummings, associate professor in the Department of
  Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science at Duke University, warns that developing
  effective anti-drone technology is a difficult task. “Tracking small airborne objects
  that are slow moving close to the ground is notoriously difficult with significant
  signal-to-noise ratio problems,” she told FoxNews.com, via email. “No system will
  be perfect and how to guard against interlopers, even if you could track them is,
  of course, another issue -- you can’t jam all GPS signals, for example, in an airport
  area because it would affect the planes trying to land and take off.”The FAA prohibits
  the use of unmanned aircraft within 5 miles of any airport within the U.S. without
  permission from air traffic control.On Monday the agency also announced new regulations
  requiring drone registration in an effort to keep track of soaring ownership. The
  online registration would apply to owners of small drones weighing more than 0.55
  pounds and less than 55 pounds, including payloads such as on-board cameras, according
  to a statement.The FAA’s progress around commercial drones has been a source of
  frustration for many companies. Amazon, for example, has been a vocal critic of
  the pace of regulatory efforts for commercial drones. Last year the retail giant
  threatened to move more of its drone development work outside of America unless
  the FAA relaxed its rules.In May the FAA announced its Pathfinder testing program,
  which is studying drone use in a number of industries, such as newsgathering, agriculture
  and transport.Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers  + FollowFoxNewsSciTech

  drone threat to aircraft, the Federal Aviation Administration has teamed up with
  IT specialist CACI International in an attempt to protect the airspace around airports.\n
  \               \n                \r\n\n            \n                Officials
  are alarmed by the scale of safety risk posed by drones, also known as Unmanned
  Aerial Systems (UAS). A study released by Bard College Friday noted 921 incidents
  involving drones and manned aircraft in U.S. airspace between Dec. 17, 2013, and
  Sept. 12, 2015.\n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                In
  October, as part of the FAA’s Pathfinder program, the agency signed an agreement
  to evaluate CACI’s technology within a 5-mile radius of airports.\n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                Related: The laser cannon that
  kills drones\n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                “Safety
  is always the FAA's top priority, and we are concerned about the increasing number
  of instances where pilots have reported seeing unmanned aircraft flying nearby,”
  said FAA Deputy Administrator Mike Whitaker, in testimony before the House Aviation
  Subcommittee.\n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                The
  FAA explained that CACI’s prototype sensor-based detection system will be evaluated
  at airports selected by the agency. Specific details of how the system will work
  have not yet been released by the FAA, although it will reportedly use radio signals
  to detect and tackle drone threats.\n                \n                \r\n\n            \n
  \               Arlington, Va.-based CACI referred a FoxNews.com request for comment
  to the FAA. The company, however, recently launched its SkyTracker system, which
  creates an electronic boundary around sensitive locations, such as airports.\n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                Related: Amazon shows off drone
  delivery prototypes\n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                The
  system uses UAS radio links to identify and locate drones flying in banned or protected
  airspace, according to CACI, and can also locate the drone’s operator. “The CACI
  system triangulates the position of misused UAS for accurate geolocation and tracking,
  while differentiating them from other UAS in the same area,” explains CACI, in a

  \               Faced with a growing drone threat to aircraft, the Federal Aviation
  Administration has teamed up with IT specialist CACI International in an attempt
  to protect the airspace around airports.Officials are alarmed by the scale of safety
  risk posed by drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). A study released
  by Bard College Friday noted 921 incidents involving drones and manned aircraft
  in U.S. airspace between Dec. 17, 2013, and Sept. 12, 2015.In October, as part of
  the FAA’s Pathfinder program, the agency signed an agreement to evaluate CACI’s
  technology within a 5-mile radius of airports.Related: The laser cannon that kills
  drones“Safety is always the FAA's top priority, and we are concerned about the increasing
  number of instances where pilots have reported seeing unmanned aircraft flying nearby,”
  said FAA Deputy Administrator Mike Whitaker, in testimony before the House Aviation
  Subcommittee.The FAA explained that CACI’s prototype sensor-based detection system
  will be evaluated at airports selected by the agency. Specific details of how the
  system will work have not yet been released by the FAA, although it will reportedly
  use radio signals to detect and tackle drone threats.Arlington, Va.-based CACI referred
  a FoxNews.com request for comment to the FAA. The company, however, recently launched
  its SkyTracker system, which creates an electronic boundary around sensitive locations,
  such as airports.Related: Amazon shows off drone delivery prototypesThe system uses
  UAS radio links to identify and locate drones flying in banned or protected airspace,
  according to CACI, and can also locate the drone’s operator. “The CACI system triangulates
  the position of misused UAS for accurate geolocation and tracking, while differentiating
  them from other UAS in the same area,” explains CACI, in a statement on its website.CACI
  says that SkyTracker can also “initiate countermeasures,” effectively stopping specific
  drones.The FAA is also reportedly looking at geo-fencing, a system that uses GPS
  and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to limit where unmanned aircraft
  can fly as it attempts to protect aircraft.Related: 'Bird' gadget lets you control
