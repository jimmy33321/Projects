  of great games for all kinds of tastes.\r\n"

  That widening variance, and the sheer volume of games released these days, is why last year, Gamasutra started running individual staff members' top five favorite games they played during a given year.

- "I figure that by now, it's a bit disingenuous to pretend to come up with a \"definitive\"
  \"Best Games 20XX\" list when the fact is, there are so many games out there of
  all kinds that our small staff could never get around to playing all of the worthy
  titles out there, let alone agree which handful are \"The Best.\" \r\n"
- "That said, our small staff, naturally, played a whole lot of games this year, and
  we all have strong opinions about the ones we loved.\r\n"
- "- Kris Graft, editor-in-chief  \r\n"
- "80 Days by Inkle\r\n"
- "Remember when you were little, and advertisements would try to get you to read
  by showing you tomes splitting open, moonbeams and dinosaurs swelling from the pages,
  cartoon children tumbling into the open book as if it were a portal to another world?
  Animations showing the words \"coming alive\" beneath your fingertips? And of course
  you understood it was a simplistic analogy for the imagination. Books didn't really
  \"come alive\" under your hands.\r\n"
- "But when you play 80 Days, written by Meg Jayanth, you remember the dream. Vibrant,
  touchable and immersive, a readable journey with subtle game mechanics, no trip
  with Mr. Phileas Fogg the same as the last. I played it on a long train trip, the
  world speeding by out my window, the world speeding by inside the magic frame I
  held in my lap. - Leigh Alexander (@leighalexander) Leigh Alexander's Top 5 Games\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "Finally, finally, people are starting to do story right... With 80 Days, what little
  there was in way of mechanics was directly influenced by the story, and directly
  influenced right back. Managing your finances and Fogg's health, as well as the
  items in your trunk and the relationships you had with the people you met along
  the road and the road itself, all of it blended together so seamlessly that you
  never felt disconnected from any part. - Phill Cameron (@phillcameron) Phill Cameron's
  Top 5 Games\r\n"
- "1001 Spikes by Nicalis and 8bits Fanatics\r\n"
- "1001 Spikes is the most tightly-designed platformer that came out this year. There
  is little room for improvisation here, and the hand of the designer is obvious:
  \"You will get through the level this way, and if you deviate from my intention
  by one pixel, or if your movement is off by a nanosecond, YOU ARE DEAD.\" Even with
  its two-button jumping feature, the designer is telling players, \"You have two
  choices: Jump this high or this high.\" It approaches puzzle design, in that solving
  a problem requires a rather specific solution.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "Lives (1001 to start) are the currency for learning each and every stage in 1001
  Spikes, and learning this game costs a lot of that currency. Many people will be
  turned off by that, because, as anyone who's played this game knows, this game is
  very difficult. But is it sadistic? Are people who play it masochists, as reviewers
  like to say about these kinds of games?\r\n"
- "Nah, 1001 Spikes is pure joy. Just remember that when you feel like breaking your
  controller in half. - Kris Graft Kris Graft's Top 5 Games\r\n"
- "The Banner Saga by Stoic Studio\r\n"
- "Interestingly, The Banner Saga feels like an odd inverse of 80 Days. Instead of
  being simple on the mechanics and systems and restrained with the scope of the stories, The
  Banner Saga went the opposite direction, setting up a huge grand narrative with
  constant interruptions of both combat and resources to manage. Instead of a romp
  it was a slog, a slow march where you shed the people who depended on you through
  war and attrition. \r\n"
- "But what made it work was how it used its context to frame smaller stories. It
  had multiple protagonists, and that in turn allowed it to have its grand narrative
  cake and eat its tasty smaller story cupcakes. With the giant Varl you had the greater
  scope of the conflict, following the efforts to repel the mechanical Dredge, whereas
  with Rook and the humans it was more about survival and escape.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "While the turn-based combat sections weren't quite as immediately engaging, the
  mechanics of it created a weird counterpoint to the stories that you were telling.
  The effects of your choices could be felt there, putting your heroes at risk could
  save more lives, or a poor decision with your supplies could start your heroes with
  fewer hit points than normal. There are greater events with greater consequences,
  but it had the interesting effect of forcing you to behave like a leader, weighing
  the pragmatic choices against the emotional ones. These were the people who would
  win the war, even if they were occasionally unsavory, or unstable, or any other
  negative quality they might possess.\r\n"
- "The differing tones and the different scopes of those stories allowed Stoic to
  do a lot with a potentially overwhelming series of events, with the only problem
  being it ended with the story incomplete. Most importantly, the choices were varied,
  ambiguous and personal, with no black or white, clear-cut differences between them.

- "Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker by Nintendo EAD Tokyo\r\n"
- "Talk about surprising -- where did this come from? Nintendo has a reputation for
  craftsmanship, but this game lays bare all the tools in its toolbox (or is that
  all the toys in its toybox?) Playing it is like a peek behind the curtain. \r\n"
- "What started as a mini-game mode in last year's Super Mario 3D World has grown
  into a game of its own, and the result is as charming and compelling as it gets.
  If you like puzzles and toys, this game should be at the top of your want-list.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "Each level is a miniature world with its own identity, purpose, and play-style
  -- a universe of handmade challenges. It's a testament to carefully creating every
  level, and the approach of fully exploring an array of simple ideas. \r\n"
- "All this is presented with no goal other than to entertain the player. Charm is
  something our industry doesn't excel at, these days, and charm is something this
  game exudes -- charm with a purpose. [For more on Captain Toad, read my blog on
  its design.] - Christian Nutt (@ferricide) Christian Nutt's Top 5 Games\r\n"
- "Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc by Spike Chunsoft\r\n"
- "The absolute dark horse of the list and my undeniable favorite, too. The visual
  novel genre is starting to get a little respect in the West, and the two Danganronpa games
  that NIS America put out this year deserve to be a big part of why: They're fresh,
  surprising, and inventive even as they cling to the sorts of long, linear stories
  that so many game designers say the medium would be better off without.\r\n"
- "The series got its start when the developers at Spike Chunsoft considered how a
  once-popular but now moribund genre could be refreshed; turns out you can do it
  through a mixture of clever writing and unexpected gameplay ideas. \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "Putting a bunch of characters into a closed environment and watching them kill
  each other off is not at all an original way to build a mystery story. Danganronpa,
  then, is made fresh by its approach to characterization and its writer's willingness
  to go absolutely anywhere and do anything. \r\n"
- "The trick is that the game manages to stay on the rails while doing it. Kazutaka
  Kodaka, the game's scenarist, managed it by breadcrumbing revelations through the
  entire game. \r\n"
- "The fact that Danganronpa is so stylized and atypical (look at those characters,
  that setting) yet so understandable and relatable is an incredibly neat trick.

- 'Look past the conflict in 2014, and you''ll see an incredible amount of great games
  for all kinds of tastes.That widening variance, and the sheer volume of games released
  these days, is why last year, Gamasutra started running individual staff members''
  top five favorite games they played during a given year.I figure that by now, it''s
  a bit disingenuous to pretend to come up with a "definitive" "Best Games 20XX" list
  when the fact is, there are so many games out there of all kinds that our small
  staff could never get around to playing all of the worthy titles out there, let
  alone agree which handful are "The Best." That said, our small staff, naturally,
  played a whole lot of games this year, and we all have strong opinions about the
  ones we loved.- Kris Graft, editor-in-chief  Remember when you were little, and
  advertisements would try to get you to read by showing you tomes splitting open,
  moonbeams and dinosaurs swelling from the pages, cartoon children tumbling into
  the open book as if it were a portal to another world? Animations showing the words
  "coming alive" beneath your fingertips? And of course you understood it was a simplistic
  analogy for the imagination. Books didn''t really "come alive" under your hands.But
  when you play 80 Days, written by Meg Jayanth, you remember the dream. Vibrant,
  touchable and immersive, a readable journey with subtle game mechanics, no trip
  with Mr. Phileas Fogg the same as the last. I played it on a long train trip, the
  world speeding by out my window, the world speeding by inside the magic frame I
  held in my lap. - Leigh Alexander (@leighalexander) Leigh Alexander''s Top 5 GamesFinally, finally,
  people are starting to do story right... With 80 Days, what little there was in
  way of mechanics was directly influenced by the story, and directly influenced right
  back. Managing your finances and Fogg''s health, as well as the items in your trunk
  and the relationships you had with the people you met along the road and the road
  itself, all of it blended together so seamlessly that you never felt disconnected
  from any part. - Phill Cameron (@phillcameron) Phill Cameron''s Top 5 Games1001
  Spikes is the most tightly-designed platformer that came out this year. There is
  little room for improvisation here, and the hand of the designer is obvious: "You
  will get through the level this way, and if you deviate from my intention by one
  pixel, or if your movement is off by a nanosecond, YOU ARE DEAD." Even with its
  two-button jumping feature, the designer is telling players, "You have two choices:
  Jump this high or this high." It approaches puzzle design, in that solving a problem
  requires a rather specific solution.Lives (1001 to start) are the currency for learning
  each and every stage in 1001 Spikes, and learning this game costs a lot of that
  currency. Many people will be turned off by that, because, as anyone who''s played
  this game knows, this game is very difficult. But is it sadistic? Are people who
  play it masochists, as reviewers like to say about these kinds of games?Nah, 1001
  Spikes is pure joy. Just remember that when you feel like breaking your controller
  in half. - Kris Graft Kris Graft''s Top 5 GamesInterestingly, The Banner Saga feels
  like an odd inverse of 80 Days. Instead of being simple on the mechanics and systems
  and restrained with the scope of the stories, The Banner Saga went the opposite
  direction, setting up a huge grand narrative with constant interruptions of both
  combat and resources to manage. Instead of a romp it was a slog, a slow march where
  you shed the people who depended on you through war and attrition. But what made
  it work was how it used its context to frame smaller stories. It had multiple protagonists,
  and that in turn allowed it to have its grand narrative cake and eat its tasty smaller
  story cupcakes. With the giant Varl you had the greater scope of the conflict, following
  the efforts to repel the mechanical Dredge, whereas with Rook and the humans it
  was more about survival and escape.While the turn-based combat sections weren''t
  quite as immediately engaging, the mechanics of it created a weird counterpoint
  to the stories that you were telling. The effects of your choices could be felt
  there, putting your heroes at risk could save more lives, or a poor decision with
  your supplies could start your heroes with fewer hit points than normal. There are
  greater events with greater consequences, but it had the interesting effect of forcing
  you to behave like a leader, weighing the pragmatic choices against the emotional
  ones. These were the people who would win the war, even if they were occasionally
  unsavory, or unstable, or any other negative quality they might possess.The differing
  tones and the different scopes of those stories allowed Stoic to do a lot with a
  potentially overwhelming series of events, with the only problem being it ended
  with the story incomplete. Most importantly, the choices were varied, ambiguous
  and personal, with no black or white, clear-cut differences between them. - Phill
  CameronTalk about surprising -- where did this come from? Nintendo has a reputation
  for craftsmanship, but this game lays bare all the tools in its toolbox (or is that
  all the toys in its toybox?) Playing it is like a peek behind the curtain. What
  started as a mini-game mode in last year''s Super Mario 3D World has grown into
  a game of its own, and the result is as charming and compelling as it gets. If you
  like puzzles and toys, this game should be at the top of your want-list.Each level
  is a miniature world with its own identity, purpose, and play-style -- a universe
  of handmade challenges. It''s a testament to carefully creating every level, and
  the approach of fully exploring an array of simple ideas. All this is presented
  with no goal other than to entertain the player. Charm is something our industry
  doesn''t excel at, these days, and charm is something this game exudes -- charm
  with a purpose. [For more on Captain Toad, read my blog on its design.] - Christian
  Nutt (@ferricide) Christian Nutt''s Top 5 GamesThe absolute dark horse of the list
  and my undeniable favorite, too. The visual novel genre is starting to get a little
  respect in the West, and the two Danganronpa games that NIS America put out this
  year deserve to be a big part of why: They''re fresh, surprising, and inventive
  even as they cling to the sorts of long, linear stories that so many game designers
  say the medium would be better off without.The series got its start when the developers
  at Spike Chunsoft considered how a once-popular but now moribund genre could be
  refreshed; turns out you can do it through a mixture of clever writing and unexpected
  gameplay ideas. Putting a bunch of characters into a closed environment and watching
  them kill each other off is not at all an original way to build a mystery story. Danganronpa,
  then, is made fresh by its approach to characterization and its writer''s willingness
  to go absolutely anywhere and do anything. The trick is that the game manages to
  stay on the rails while doing it. Kazutaka Kodaka, the game''s scenarist, managed
  it by breadcrumbing revelations through the entire game. The fact that Danganronpa is
  so stylized and atypical (look at those characters, that setting) yet so understandable
  and relatable is an incredibly neat trick.  - Christian Nutt'

  \                \n                Look past the conflict in 2014, and you'll see
  an incredible amount of great games for all kinds of tastes.\r\nThat widening variance,
  and the sheer volume of games released these days, is why last year, Gamasutra started
  running individual staff members' top five favorite games they played during a given
  year.\n                \n                    \n                                                                                    \n\n

  \               \n                \r\nI figure that by now, it's a bit disingenuous
  to pretend to come up with a \"definitive\" \"Best Games 20XX\" list when the fact
  is, there are so many games out there of all kinds that our small staff could never
  get around to playing all of the worthy titles out there, let alone agree which
  handful are \"The Best.\" \r\nThat said, our small staff, naturally, played a whole
  lot of games this year, and we all have strong opinions about the ones we loved.\r\n-
  Kris Graft, editor-in-chief  \r\n80 Days by Inkle\r\nRemember when you were little,
  and advertisements would try to get you to read by showing you tomes splitting open,
  moonbeams and dinosaurs swelling from the pages, cartoon children tumbling into
  the open book as if it were a portal to another world? Animations showing the words
  \"coming alive\" beneath your fingertips? And of course you understood it was a
  simplistic analogy for the imagination. Books didn't really \"come alive\" under
  your hands.\r\nBut when you play 80 Days, written by Meg Jayanth, you remember the
  dream. Vibrant, touchable and immersive, a readable journey with subtle game mechanics,
  no trip with Mr. Phileas Fogg the same as the last. I played it on a long train
  trip, the world speeding by out my window, the world speeding by inside the magic
  frame I held in my lap. - Leigh Alexander (@leighalexander) Leigh Alexander's Top
  5 Games\r\n\r\nFinally, finally, people are starting to do story right... With 80
  Days, what little there was in way of mechanics was directly influenced by the story,
  and directly influenced right back. Managing your finances and Fogg's health, as
  well as the items in your trunk and the relationships you had with the people you
  met along the road and the road itself, all of it blended together so seamlessly
  that you never felt disconnected from any part. - Phill Cameron (@phillcameron)
  Phill Cameron's Top 5 Games\r\n1001 Spikes by Nicalis and 8bits Fanatics\r\n1001
  Spikes is the most tightly-designed platformer that came out this year. There is
  little room for improvisation here, and the hand of the designer is obvious: \"You
  will get through the level this way, and if you deviate from my intention by one
  pixel, or if your movement is off by a nanosecond, YOU ARE DEAD.\" Even with its
  two-button jumping feature, the designer is telling players, \"You have two choices:
  Jump this high or this high.\" It approaches puzzle design, in that solving a problem
  requires a rather specific solution.\r\n\r\nLives (1001 to start) are the currency
  for learning each and every stage in 1001 Spikes, and learning this game costs a
  lot of that currency. Many people will be turned off by that, because, as anyone
  who's played this game knows, this game is very difficult. But is it sadistic? Are
  people who play it masochists, as reviewers like to say about these kinds of games?\r\nNah, 1001
  Spikes is pure joy. Just remember that when you feel like breaking your controller
  in half. - Kris Graft Kris Graft's Top 5 Games\r\nThe Banner Saga by Stoic Studio\r\nInterestingly, The
  Banner Saga feels like an odd inverse of 80 Days. Instead of being simple on the
  mechanics and systems and restrained with the scope of the stories, The Banner Saga went
  the opposite direction, setting up a huge grand narrative with constant interruptions
  of both combat and resources to manage. Instead of a romp it was a slog, a slow
  march where you shed the people who depended on you through war and attrition. \r\nBut
  what made it work was how it used its context to frame smaller stories. It had multiple
  protagonists, and that in turn allowed it to have its grand narrative cake and eat
  its tasty smaller story cupcakes. With the giant Varl you had the greater scope
  of the conflict, following the efforts to repel the mechanical Dredge, whereas with
  Rook and the humans it was more about survival and escape.\r\n\r\nWhile the turn-based
  combat sections weren't quite as immediately engaging, the mechanics of it created
  a weird counterpoint to the stories that you were telling. The effects of your choices
  could be felt there, putting your heroes at risk could save more lives, or a poor
  decision with your supplies could start your heroes with fewer hit points than normal.
  There are greater events with greater consequences, but it had the interesting effect
  of forcing you to behave like a leader, weighing the pragmatic choices against the
  emotional ones. These were the people who would win the war, even if they were occasionally
  unsavory, or unstable, or any other negative quality they might possess.\r\nThe
  differing tones and the different scopes of those stories allowed Stoic to do a
  lot with a potentially overwhelming series of events, with the only problem being
  it ended with the story incomplete. Most importantly, the choices were varied, ambiguous
  and personal, with no black or white, clear-cut differences between them. - Phill
  Cameron\r\nCaptain Toad: Treasure Tracker by Nintendo EAD Tokyo\r\nTalk about surprising
  -- where did this come from? Nintendo has a reputation for craftsmanship, but this
  game lays bare all the tools in its toolbox (or is that all the toys in its toybox?)
  Playing it is like a peek behind the curtain. \r\nWhat started as a mini-game mode
  in last year's Super Mario 3D World has grown into a game of its own, and the result
  is as charming and compelling as it gets. If you like puzzles and toys, this game
  should be at the top of your want-list.\r\n\r\nEach level is a miniature world with
  its own identity, purpose, and play-style -- a universe of handmade challenges.
  It's a testament to carefully creating every level, and the approach of fully exploring
  an array of simple ideas. \r\nAll this is presented with no goal other than to entertain
  the player. Charm is something our industry doesn't excel at, these days, and charm
  is something this game exudes -- charm with a purpose. [For more on Captain Toad, read
  my blog on its design.] - Christian Nutt (@ferricide) Christian Nutt's Top 5 Games\r\nDanganronpa:
  Trigger Happy Havoc by Spike Chunsoft\r\nThe absolute dark horse of the list and
  my undeniable favorite, too. The visual novel genre is starting to get a little
  respect in the West, and the two Danganronpa games that NIS America put out this
  year deserve to be a big part of why: They're fresh, surprising, and inventive even
  as they cling to the sorts of long, linear stories that so many game designers say
  the medium would be better off without.\r\nThe series got its start when the developers
  at Spike Chunsoft considered how a once-popular but now moribund genre could be
  refreshed; turns out you can do it through a mixture of clever writing and unexpected
  gameplay ideas. \r\n\r\nPutting a bunch of characters into a closed environment
  and watching them kill each other off is not at all an original way to build a mystery
  story. Danganronpa, then, is made fresh by its approach to characterization and
  its writer's willingness to go absolutely anywhere and do anything. \r\nThe trick
  is that the game manages to stay on the rails while doing it. Kazutaka Kodaka, the
  game's scenarist, managed it by breadcrumbing revelations through the entire game. \r\nThe
  fact that Danganronpa is so stylized and atypical (look at those characters, that
  setting) yet so understandable and relatable is an incredibly neat trick.  - Christian

  past the conflict in 2014, and you'll see an incredible amount of great games for
  all kinds of tastes.That widening variance, and the sheer volume of games released
  these days, is why last year, Gamasutra started running individual staff members'
  top five favorite games they played during a given year.I figure that by now, it's
  a bit disingenuous to pretend to come up with a \"definitive\" \"Best Games 20XX\"
  list when the fact is, there are so many games out there of all kinds that our small
  staff could never get around to playing all of the worthy titles out there, let
  alone agree which handful are \"The Best.\" That said, our small staff, naturally,
  played a whole lot of games this year, and we all have strong opinions about the
  ones we loved.- Kris Graft, editor-in-chief  Remember when you were little, and
  advertisements would try to get you to read by showing you tomes splitting open,
  moonbeams and dinosaurs swelling from the pages, cartoon children tumbling into
  the open book as if it were a portal to another world? Animations showing the words
  \"coming alive\" beneath your fingertips? And of course you understood it was a
  simplistic analogy for the imagination. Books didn't really \"come alive\" under
  your hands.But when you play 80 Days, written by Meg Jayanth, you remember the dream.
  Vibrant, touchable and immersive, a readable journey with subtle game mechanics,
  no trip with Mr. Phileas Fogg the same as the last. I played it on a long train
  trip, the world speeding by out my window, the world speeding by inside the magic
  frame I held in my lap. - Leigh Alexander (@leighalexander) Leigh Alexander's Top
  5 GamesFinally, finally, people are starting to do story right... With 80 Days,
  what little there was in way of mechanics was directly influenced by the story,
  and directly influenced right back. Managing your finances and Fogg's health, as
  well as the items in your trunk and the relationships you had with the people you
  met along the road and the road itself, all of it blended together so seamlessly
  that you never felt disconnected from any part. - Phill Cameron (@phillcameron)
  Phill Cameron's Top 5 Games1001 Spikes is the most tightly-designed platformer that
  came out this year. There is little room for improvisation here, and the hand of
  the designer is obvious: \"You will get through the level this way, and if you deviate
  from my intention by one pixel, or if your movement is off by a nanosecond, YOU
  ARE DEAD.\" Even with its two-button jumping feature, the designer is telling players,
  \"You have two choices: Jump this high or this high.\" It approaches puzzle design,
  in that solving a problem requires a rather specific solution.Lives (1001 to start)
  are the currency for learning each and every stage in 1001 Spikes, and learning
  this game costs a lot of that currency. Many people will be turned off by that,
  because, as anyone who's played this game knows, this game is very difficult. But
  is it sadistic? Are people who play it masochists, as reviewers like to say about
  these kinds of games?Nah, 1001 Spikes is pure joy. Just remember that when you feel
  like breaking your controller in half. - Kris Graft Kris Graft's Top 5 GamesInterestingly, The
  Banner Saga feels like an odd inverse of 80 Days. Instead of being simple on the
  mechanics and systems and restrained with the scope of the stories, The Banner Saga went
  the opposite direction, setting up a huge grand narrative with constant interruptions
  of both combat and resources to manage. Instead of a romp it was a slog, a slow
  march where you shed the people who depended on you through war and attrition. But
  what made it work was how it used its context to frame smaller stories. It had multiple
  protagonists, and that in turn allowed it to have its grand narrative cake and eat
  its tasty smaller story cupcakes. With the giant Varl you had the greater scope
  of the conflict, following the efforts to repel the mechanical Dredge, whereas with
  Rook and the humans it was more about survival and escape.While the turn-based combat
  sections weren't quite as immediately engaging, the mechanics of it created a weird
  counterpoint to the stories that you were telling. The effects of your choices could
  be felt there, putting your heroes at risk could save more lives, or a poor decision
  with your supplies could start your heroes with fewer hit points than normal. There
  are greater events with greater consequences, but it had the interesting effect
  of forcing you to behave like a leader, weighing the pragmatic choices against the
  emotional ones. These were the people who would win the war, even if they were occasionally
  unsavory, or unstable, or any other negative quality they might possess.The differing
  tones and the different scopes of those stories allowed Stoic to do a lot with a
  potentially overwhelming series of events, with the only problem being it ended
  with the story incomplete. Most importantly, the choices were varied, ambiguous
  and personal, with no black or white, clear-cut differences between them. - Phill
  CameronTalk about surprising -- where did this come from? Nintendo has a reputation
  for craftsmanship, but this game lays bare all the tools in its toolbox (or is that
  all the toys in its toybox?) Playing it is like a peek behind the curtain. What
  started as a mini-game mode in last year's Super Mario 3D World has grown into a
  game of its own, and the result is as charming and compelling as it gets. If you
  like puzzles and toys, this game should be at the top of your want-list.Each level
  is a miniature world with its own identity, purpose, and play-style -- a universe
  of handmade challenges. It's a testament to carefully creating every level, and
  the approach of fully exploring an array of simple ideas. All this is presented
  with no goal other than to entertain the player. Charm is something our industry
  doesn't excel at, these days, and charm is something this game exudes -- charm with
  a purpose. [For more on Captain Toad, read my blog on its design.] - Christian Nutt
  (@ferricide) Christian Nutt's Top 5 GamesThe absolute dark horse of the list and
  my undeniable favorite, too. The visual novel genre is starting to get a little
  respect in the West, and the two Danganronpa games that NIS America put out this
  year deserve to be a big part of why: They're fresh, surprising, and inventive even
  as they cling to the sorts of long, linear stories that so many game designers say
  the medium would be better off without.The series got its start when the developers
  at Spike Chunsoft considered how a once-popular but now moribund genre could be
  refreshed; turns out you can do it through a mixture of clever writing and unexpected
  gameplay ideas. Putting a bunch of characters into a closed environment and watching
  them kill each other off is not at all an original way to build a mystery story. Danganronpa,
  then, is made fresh by its approach to characterization and its writer's willingness
  to go absolutely anywhere and do anything. The trick is that the game manages to
  stay on the rails while doing it. Kazutaka Kodaka, the game's scenarist, managed
  it by breadcrumbing revelations through the entire game. The fact that Danganronpa is
  so stylized and atypical (look at those characters, that setting) yet so understandable
  and relatable is an incredibly neat trick.  - Christian Nutt"
