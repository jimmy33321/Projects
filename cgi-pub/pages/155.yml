  Dec 11 | \r\n              linked pages may have been updated more recently\r\n
  \         The  Internet History Sourcebooks Project is a collection of public domain
  and copy-permitted historical texts presented cleanly\r\n            (without advertising
  or excessive layout) for educational use.  \r\n            1. This project is both
  very large and fairly old\r\n            in Internet terms. At the time it was instigated
  (1996), it was not clear\r\n            that web sites [and the documents made available
  there] would often turn out to be\r\n            transient. As a result there is
  a process called \"link rot\" - which means that a \"broken link\" is a result of
  someone having taken down a web page. In some cases some websites have simply reorganized
  sub-directories without creating forwarding links. Since 2000, very\r\n            few
  links to external sites have been made. An effort is under way to remove bad\r\n
  \           links.\r\n            2. All links to\r\n            documents marked
  [at this Site] should be working. [In the Internet\r\n              Medieval Sourcebook,
  but not the other associated\r\n              sourcebooks, if there is no indication
  of\r\n              the file's location then the text is hosted locally and the
  link should\r\n              be working.3. Users may attempt to locate texts not
  currently available, or where the links have changed via  The Internet Archive/Way
  Back Machine. Alternately, a search via Google may locate another site where the
  document is available. \r\n          Feedback and Help\r\n              While I
  encourage notes, comments and feedback in general, I am\r\n            unable to
  reply to all of them. I am especially not able to reply to students (or\r\n            students'
  parents!) seeking help with homework.\r\n            For guidance on homework, research,
  how people\r\n            lived/ate/dressed in the past, see the various Help! pages:
  \         \r\n          Ancient History Help\r\n    Medieval Studies Help\r\n    Modern
  History Help\r\n  I am unable to help locate details about your family, or give\r\n
  \           translations of your name or nickname into Chinese (a very common request)!\r\n
  \           If you find bad links, or typographical\r\n            errors, please
  do notify me by telling me the URL (web address) of the\r\n            specific
  page with the fault, and (in the case of bad links) the URL of the bad link.            \r\n
  \         Finding Texts and Information on this Site\r\n            Use the Search
  page to\r\n            find texts or other items located at this web site.\r\n            I
  am always happy to hear from people who wish to submit copy\r\n            permitted
  texts to the various sites below.                  \r\n          Statement on Copyright

  \         Medieval Sourcebook\r\n          This is an online source book of copy-permitted,
  although not necessarily copyright-free,\r\n          source material for Medieval
  Studies. It is the largest online resource of medieval and\r\n          Byzantine
  textual sources.  \r\n        Internet\r\n          Modern History Sourcebook \r\n
  \         Now with almost as many online texts as the Medieval Sourcebook, this
  also constitutes a\r\n          \"classroom usable\" sourcebook of copy-permitted
  material for Modern European\r\n          history and Modern Civilization courses.

  \ Traveler's accounts of their journeys and the lands they visit are\r\n          important
  sources in understanding the past.  As outsiders, travelers often note\r\n          aspects
  of a culture that are too commonplace for local commentators to mention. More than\r\n
  \         this, travelers often provide some insight into how their own society
  understood itself in\r\n          relation to other cultures.\r\n\r\n        Legal

  Modified: Dec 11 | \r\n              linked pages may have been updated more recentlyThe
  \ Internet History Sourcebooks Project is a collection of public domain and copy-permitted
  historical texts presented cleanly\r\n            (without advertising or excessive
  layout) for educational use.  \r\n            1. This project is both very large
  and fairly old\r\n            in Internet terms. At the time it was instigated (1996),
  it was not clear\r\n            that web sites [and the documents made available
  there] would often turn out to be\r\n            transient. As a result there is
  a process called \"link rot\" - which means that a \"broken link\" is a result of
  someone having taken down a web page. In some cases some websites have simply reorganized
  sub-directories without creating forwarding links. Since 2000, very\r\n            few
  links to external sites have been made. An effort is under way to remove bad\r\n
  \           links.\r\n            2. All links to\r\n            documents marked
  [at this Site] should be working. [In the Internet\r\n              Medieval Sourcebook,
  but not the other associated\r\n              sourcebooks, if there is no indication
  of\r\n              the file's location then the text is hosted locally and the
  link should\r\n              be working.3. Users may attempt to locate texts not
  currently available, or where the links have changed via  The Internet Archive/Way
  Back Machine. Alternately, a search via Google may locate another site where the
  document is available. Feedback and Help\r\n              While I encourage notes,
  comments and feedback in general, I am\r\n            unable to reply to all of
  them. I am especially not able to reply to students (or\r\n            students'
  parents!) seeking help with homework.\r\n            For guidance on homework, research,
  how people\r\n            lived/ate/dressed in the past, see the various Help! pages:

  of your name or nickname into Chinese (a very common request)!\r\n            If
  you find bad links, or typographical\r\n            errors, please do notify me
  by telling me the URL (web address) of the\r\n            specific page with the
  fault, and (in the case of bad links) the URL of the bad link.            Finding
  Texts and Information on this Site\r\n            Use the Search page to\r\n            find
