  published on 2015-10-01The following are ALL rules, proposed rules, and notices
  (chronologically) published in the Federal Register relating to 44 CFR Part 206
  after this date.FEMA proposes to revise its regulations to comply with Section 1109
  of the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 which requires FEMA, in cooperation
  with State, local, and Tribal emergency management agencies, to review, update,
  and revise through rulemaking the Individual Assistance factors FEMA uses to measure
  the severity, magnitude, and impact of a disaster.On December 19, 2014, all Federal
  award-making agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its
  component, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), published a joint interim
  final rule implementing the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)'s Uniform Administrative
  Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards. DHS and
  FEMA now adopt, with one change, the interim final rule as final. The change restores
  language in the FEMA State and Tribal mitigation planning regulations that was inadvertently
  removed by the interim final rule.All lawyers"

  Management Agency Final rule. Effective Date: November 2, 2015. 2 CFR Part 3002
  SummaryOn December 19, 2014, all Federal award-making agencies, including the Department
  of Homeland Security (DHS) and its component, the Federal Emergency Management Agency
  (FEMA), published a joint interim final rule implementing the Office of Management
  and Budget (OMB)'s Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit
  Requirements for Federal Awards. DHS and FEMA now adopt, with one change, the interim
  final rule as final. The change restores language in the FEMA State and Tribal mitigation
  planning regulations that was inadvertently removed by the interim final rule. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t

  policiesTitle 44 published on 2015-10-01The following are ALL rules, proposed rules,
  and notices (chronologically) published in the Federal Register relating to 44 CFR
  Part 206 after this date.FEMA proposes to revise its regulations to comply with
  Section 1109 of the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 which requires FEMA,
  in cooperation with State, local, and Tribal emergency management agencies, to review,
  update, and revise through rulemaking the Individual Assistance factors FEMA uses
  to measure the severity, magnitude, and impact of a disaster.On December 19, 2014,
  all Federal award-making agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security
  (DHS) and its component, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), published
  a joint interim final rule implementing the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)'s
  Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for
  Federal Awards. DHS and FEMA now adopt, with one change, the interim final rule
  as final. The change restores language in the FEMA State and Tribal mitigation planning
  regulations that was inadvertently removed by the interim final rule.All lawyers"
