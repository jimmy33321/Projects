                  Agnosticism is a philosophical and theological
- |2
                      concept which has been understood in various ways by different
- |2
                      philosophers and theologians. T. H. Huxley coined the term in 1869, and its
- |2
                      first home was in the disputes about science and religion, naturalism and
- |2
                          super- naturalism, that reached a
- |2
                      climax during the nineteenth century. To be an agnostic is to hold that
- |2
                      nothing can be known or at least that it is very unlikely that any- thing will be known or soundly believed
- |2
                      concerning whether God or any transcendent reality or state exists.
- |2
                  It is very natural for certain people conditioned in certain ways to believe
- |2
                      that there must be some power “behind,”
- |2
                      “beyond,” or “underlying” the
- |2
                      universe which is responsible for its order and all the incredible
- |2
                      features that are observed and studied by the sciences even though these
- |2
                      same people will readily grant that we do not know that there is such a
- |2
                      power or have good grounds for believing that there is such a power.
- |2
                      While the admission of ignorance concerning things divine is usually made
- |2
                      by someone outside the circle of faith, it can and indeed has been made by
- |2
                      fideistic Jews and Christians as well.
- |2
                  Some writers, e.g., Robert Flint and James Ward, so construed
- |2
                      “agnosticism” that (1) it was identified with
- |2
                      “philosophical skepticism” and (2) it allowed for
- |2
                      there being “theistic agnostics” and “Christian
- |2
                          agnos- tics.” However, the more
- |2
                      typical employment of “ag-
- |2
                      nosticism” is such that it would not be correct to count
- |2
                      as agnostics either fideistic believers or Jews and Chris- tians who claim that we can only gain knowledge of
- |2
                      God through some mystical awareness or “ineffable
- |2
                      knowledge.” It surely was this standard but more cir- cumscribed sense of
- |2
                      “agnosticism” that William James
- |2
                       had in mind when he made his famous remark in his essay
- |2
                      “The Will to Believe” that agnosticism was the worst
- |2
                      thing that “ever came out of the philosopher's
- |2
                      workshop.” Without implying or suggesting any sup- port at all for James's value judgment, we shall
- |2
                      construe agnosticism in this rather more typical manner. Given this
- |2
                      construal (1) “theistic agnosticism” is a contra- diction and thus one cannot be a Jew
- |2
                      or a Christian and be an agnostic and (2) also agnosticism is neutral vis-à-vis the claim that there can
- |2
                      be no philosophical knowledge or even scientific or common-sense knowl- edge. We shall then take agnosticism to
- |2
                      be the more limited claim that we either do not or cannot know that
- |2
                      God or any other transcendent reality or state exists and thus we should
- |2
                      suspend judgment concerning the assertion that God exists. That is to say,
- |2
                      the agnostic neither affirms nor denies it. This, as should be evident
- |2
                      from the above characterization, can take further specification and indeed
- |2
                      later such specifications will be supplied. But such a construal captures
- |2
                      in its char- acterization both what was
- |2
                      essentially at issue in the great agnostic debates in the nineteenth
- |2
                      century and the issue as it has come down to us.

- |2
                  T. H. Huxley was by training a biologist, but he had strong philosophical
- |2
                      interests and as a champion of Darwinism he became a major intellectual
- |2
                      figure in the nineteenth century. In his “Science and
- |2
                      Christian Tradition” (in Collected
- |2
                      Essays), Huxley remarks that agnosticism is a method, a stance taken
- |2
                      toward putative religious truth-claims, the core of which is to refuse
- |2
                      to assent to religious doctrines for which there is no adequate evidence,
- |2
                      but to retain an open-mindedness about the possibility of sometime
- |2
                      attaining adequate evidence. We ought never to assert that we know a
- |2
                      proposition to be true or indeed even to assent to that proposition unless
- |2
                      we have adequate evidence to sup- port it.
- |2
                  After his youthful reading of the Scottish meta-
- |2
                          physician William Hamilton's Philosophy of the
- |2
                              Un- conditioned (1829),
- |2
                      Huxley repeatedly returned to questions about the limits of our possible
- |2
                      knowledge and came, as did Leslie Stephen, to the empiricist
- |2
                      conclusion that we cannot know anything about God or any alleged states or
- |2
                      realities “beyond phenomena.” Whether there is a God,
- |2
                      a world of demons, an immor- tal soul, whether
- |2
                      indeed “the spiritual world” is other than human
- |2
                      fantasy or projection, were all taken by Huxley to be factual questions open to careful and systematic empirical
- |2
                      investigation. In short, however humanly important such questions were,
- |2
                      they were also “matters of the intellect” and in such
- |2
                      contexts the018
- |2
                       central maxim of the method of agnosticism is to “fol- low your reason as far as it will take you,
- |2
                      without regard to any other consideration. And negatively: In matters

                      of the intellect do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not
- |2
                      demonstrated or demon- strable”
- |2
                      (Huxley, pp. 245-46). Operating in accordance with such a method does not
- |2
                      justify “the denial of the existence of any Supernature; but
- |2
                      simply the denial of the validity of the evidence adduced in favour of
- |2
                      this, or that, extant form of Supernaturalism” (p. 126). Huxley
- |2
                      found that he could no more endorse materi-
- |2
                      alism, idealism, atheism, or pantheism than he could theism; they
- |2
                      all claimed too much about essentially contested matters. Huxley felt that
- |2
                      people espousing such world views were too ready to claim a solution
- |2
                      to the “problem of existence,” while he remained
- |2
                      painfully aware that he had not succeeded in coming by such a solution and
- |2
                      in addition retained “a pretty strong conviction that the
- |2
                      problem was insoluble” (pp. 237-38).
- |2
                  This conviction is at the heart of his agnosticism. Huxley was convinced
- |2
                      that Kant and Hamilton had established that reason fails us—and
- |2
                      indeed must fail us—when we try to
- |2
                      establish that the world is finite in space or time or indefinite in space
- |2
                      or time, rational or irrational, an ordered whole or simply
- |2
                      manifesting certain ordered features but not something properly to be
- |2
                      called an ordered whole. Answers to such ques-
- |2
                      tions reveal something about our attitudes but can never provide us
- |2
                      with propositions we can justifiably claim to be true or even know to be
- |2
                      false. Agnosticism is a confession of honesty here. It is “the
- |2
                      only position for people who object to say that they know what they
- |2
                      are quite aware they do not know” (p. 210).
- |2
                  Such skepticism concerning the truth-claims of reli-
- |2
                          gion and metaphysics, including, of course, meta- physical religiosity, should not be taken as a denial
- |2
                      that there can be reliable knowledge. Rather Huxley argued, as John
- |2
                      Dewey did far more systematically later, that we can and do gain
- |2
                      experimental and ex- periential knowledge
- |2
                      of nature, including human na- ture, and that
- |2
                      this, by contrast with so-called “super- natural knowledge,” becomes increasingly more
- |2
                          exten- sive and reliable. And while
- |2
                      remaining an agnostic, Huxley saw in science—basically the
- |2
                      scientific way of fixing belief—a fundamental and well grounded
- |2
                          chal- lenge to the authority of the theory
- |2
                      of the “spiritual world.”
- |2
                  Whatever may have been the case in the seventeenth century, there was in
- |2
                      Huxley's time a state of war between science and religion. Huxley took
- |2
                      science to be a challenge to claims of biblical infallibility and
- |2
                      revelation. The whole supernatural world view built on the authority of the
- |2
                      Bible and revelation must come
- |2
                       under scientific scrutiny and when this is done it be- comes gradually apparent that the use of the
- |2
                      scientific method and appeals to scientific canons of criticism give
- |2
                      us a far more reliable method of settling belief than do the scriptures and
- |2
                      revelation.
- |2
                  To commit ourselves to the Bible as an infallible authority is to commit
- |2
                      ourselves to a world view in which we must believe that devils were cast
- |2
                      out of a man and went into a herd of swine, that the deluge was
- |2
                      universal, that the world was made in six days, and the like. Yet such
- |2
                      claims are plainly and massively contravened by our actual empirical
- |2
                      knowledge such that they are quite beyond the boundaries of respon- sible belief. About such matters,
- |2
                      Huxley argues, we ought not to be at all agnostic. Moreover, we cannot
- |2
                      take them simply as myths, important for the biblical and Christian
- |2
                      understanding of the world, if we are to take seriously biblical
- |2
                      infallibility and the authority of revelation. For the Jewish-Christian
- |2
                      world view to establish its validity, it must provide us with adequate
- |2
                      grounds for believing that there are demons. But there is no good evidence
- |2
                      for such alleged realities and to believe in them is the grossest form of
- |2
                      superstition (Huxley, p. 215).
- |2
                  Even if we fall back on a severe Christology, we are still in difficulties,
- |2
                      for it is evident enough that Jesus believed in demons and if we are to
- |2
                      adopt a radical Christology and take Jesus as our infallible guide to
- |2
                      the divine, we are going to have to accept such super- stitious beliefs. Such beliefs affront not only our
- |2
                          intel- lect—our credibility
- |2
                      concerning what it is reasonable to believe—they also affront
- |2
                      our moral sense as well (p. 226). Yet once we give up the Gospel claim
- |2
                      that there are “demons who can be transferred from a man to
- |2
                      a pig,” the other stories of “demonic possession fall
- |2
                      under suspicion.” Once we start on this slide, once we challenge
- |2
                      the ultimate authority of the Bible, and follow experimental and scientific
- |2
                      procedures, the ground for the whole Judeo-Christian world view is
- |2
                      undermined.
- |2
                  Huxley obviously thinks its credibility and proba-
- |2
                          bility is of a very low order; an order which would make
- |2
                      Christian or Jewish belief quite impossible for a reasonable and tolerably
- |2
                      well informed man. Those who claim to know that there are such unseen
- |2
                      and indeed utterly unseeable realities, are very likely peo- ple who have taken “cunning phrases for
- |2
                      answers,” where real answers are “not merely actually
- |2
                          impossi- ble, but theoretically
- |2
                      inconceivable.” Yet as an agnostic one must
- |2
                      always—even for such problematical trans- cendental claims—remain open to conviction
- |2
                      where evidence can be brought to establish the truth of such
- |2
                      transcendent religious claims.
- |2
                  Leslie Stephen in his neglected An Agnostic's019
- |2
                           Apology (1893) remarks that he uses
- |2
                      “agnostic” in a sense close to that of T. H. Huxley.
- |2
                      To be an agnostic, according to Stephen, is to reject what he calls
- |2
                          “Dog- matic Atheism,”
- |2
                      i.e., “the doctrine that there is no God, whatever is meant by
- |2
                      God...”; it is, instead, (1) to affirm “what no one
- |2
                      denies,” namely “that there are limits to the sphere
- |2
                      of human intelligence” and (2) also to affirm the controversial
- |2
                      empiricist thesis “that those limits are such as to exclude at
- |2
                      least what Lewes called 'Metempirical knowledge'” (p. 1).
- |2
                      (“Metempirical knowledge” is meant to designate all
- |2
                      forms of knowl- edge of a transcendent,
- |2
                      numinal, nonempirical sort.)
- |2
                  Stephen makes apparent the empiricist commit-
- |2
                      ments of his conception of agnosticism in charac- terizing gnosticism, the view agnosticism is
- |2
                      deliberately set against. To be a gnostic is to believe that “we
- |2
                      can attain truths not capable of verification and not needing
- |2
                      verification by actual experiment or observation” (ibid., pp.
- |2
                      1-2). In gaining such a knowledge gnostics in opposition to both Hume and
- |2
                      Kant claim that by the use of our reason we can attain a knowledge
- |2
                      that transcends “the narrow limits of experience” (p.
- |2
                      1). But the agnostic, firmly in the empiricist tradition, denies that
- |2
                      there can be any knowledge of the world, includ-
- |2
                      ing anything about its origin and destiny, which tran- scends experience and comprehends “the sorry
- |2
                      scheme of things entire.” Such putative knowledge, Stephen
- |2
                      maintains, is illusory and not something “essential to the
- |2
                      highest interests of mankind,” providing us, as speculative
- |2
                      metaphysicians believe, with the solution to “the dark riddle of
- |2
                      the universe” (p. 2).
- |2
                  In a manner that anticipates the challenge to the claims of religion and
- |2
                      metaphysics made by the logical empiricists, Stephen says that in addition
- |2
                      to the prob- lem of whether they can establish
- |2
                      the truth or probable truth of “religious
- |2
                      truth-claims” there is the further
- |2
                      consideration—actually a logically prior question—of
- |2
                      whether such putative claims “have any meaning” (p.
- |2
                      3).
- |2
                  It should be noted that Stephen does not begin “An Agnostic's
- |2
                      Apology” by discussing semantical diffi- culties in putative religious truth-claims but starts
- |2
                      with problems connected with what W. K. Clifford was later to call
- |2
                      “the ethics of belief.” We indeed would all
- |2
                      want—if we could do it honestly—to accept the claim
- |2
                      that “evil is transitory... good eternal” and that
- |2
                      the “world is really an embodiment of love and wisdom,
- |2
                      however dark it may appear to us” (p. 2). But the rub is that
- |2
                      many of us cannot believe that and in a question of such inestimable human
- |2
                      value, we have “the most sacred obligations to recognize the
- |2
                      facts” and make our judgments in accordance with the facts. But
- |2
                      the facts do not give us grounds for confidence in the viability of
- |2
                      Judeo-Christian beliefs. Rather we are
- |2
                       strongly inclined when we inspect these beliefs to believe they
- |2
                      are wish fulfillments. And while it may indeed be true that for the moment
- |2
                      dreams may be pleasanter than realities, it is also true that if we
- |2
                      are bent on attaining a more permanent measure of happi- ness, it “must be won by adapting our lives
- |2
                      to the realities,” for we know from experience that
- |2
                      illusory consolations “are the bitterest of
- |2
                      mockeries” (ibid.). The religious platitudes “Pain is
- |2
                      not an evil,” “Death is not a separation,”
- |2
                      and “Sickness is but a blessing in disguise” have
- |2
                      tortured sufferers far more than “the gloomiest speculations of
- |2
                      avowed pessimists” (ibid.).
- |2
                  However, the problem of meaning cuts to a deeper
- |2
                      conceptual level than do such arguments about the ethics of belief. Where
- |2
                      Judeo-Christianity does not have a fideistic basis, it is committed to what
- |2
                      Stephen calls gnosticism. But does not such a doctrine fail
- |2
                      “to recognize the limits of possible knowledge” and
- |2
                      in trying to transcend these limits does it not in effect commit the
- |2
                      gnostic to pseudo-propositions which are devoid of literal meaning? Logical
- |2
                      empiricists later answered this question in the affirmative and while
- |2
                      it is not crystal clear that Stephen's answer is quite that definite,
- |2
                      it would appear that this is what he wants to maintain. And if that is what
- |2
                      Stephen is maintaining, there can, of course, be no knowledge of the
- |2
                      divine.
- |2
                  Stephen raises this key question concerning the intelligibility of such
- |2
                      gnostic God-talk, but he does little with it. Instead he focuses on some
- |2
                      key questions concerning attempts by theologians to undermine
- |2
                      agnosticism. He first points out that an appeal to rev- elation is no answer to the agnostic's denial that we
- |2
                      have knowledge of transcendent realities or states, for in claiming to rely
- |2
                      exclusively on revelation these theologians acknowledge that
- |2
                      “natural man can know nothing of the Divine nature.”
- |2
                      But this Stephen replies, is not only to grant but in effect to assert the
- |2
                      agnostic's fundamental principle (p. 5). He points out that H. L.
- |2
                      Mansel in effect and in substance affirms agnosticism and that Cardinal
- |2
                      Newman with his appeal to the testimony of conscience does not provide a
- |2
                      reliable argument on which to base a belief in God nor does he
- |2
                      undermine the agnostic's position, for “the voice of conscience
- |2
                      has been very differently interpreted.” Some of these
- |2
                      interpretations, secular though they be, have all the appearances of being
- |2
                      at least as valid as Newman's, for all that Newman or anyone else has
- |2
                      shown. Moreover, on any reasonable reading of a prin-
- |2
                          ciple of parsimony, they are far simpler than Newman's
- |2
                      interpretation. Thus Newman's arguments in reality prove, as do Mansel's,
- |2
                      that a man ought to be an agnostic concerning such ultimate questions
- |2
                      where reason remains his guide and where he does not make an appeal to
- |2
                      the authority of the Church. They, of020
- |2
                       course, would have us accept the authority of the Church, but
- |2
                      how can we reasonably do so when there are so many Churches, so many
- |2
                      conflicting authorities, and so many putative revelations? Where reason
- |2
                      can only lead us to agnosticism concerning religious mat- ters, we can have no ground for accepting one Church,
- |2
                      one religious authority, or one putative revelation rather than another. We
- |2
                      simply have no way of know- ing which course is
- |2
                      the better course. Agnosticism, Stephen concludes, is the only reasonable
- |2
                      and viable alternative.
- |2
                  Like Huxley, and like Hume before him, Stephen is skeptical of the a priori arguments of metaphysics and natural
- |2
                      theology. “There is not a single proof of natural
- |2
                      theology,” he asserts, “of which the negative has not
- |2
                      been maintained as vigorously as the affirmative” (p. 9). In
- |2
                      such a context, where there is no substantial agreement, but just endless
- |2
                      and irre- solvable philosophical
- |2
                      controversy, it is the duty of a reasonable man to profess ignorance (p.
- |2
                      9). In trying to escape the bounds of sense—in trying to gain
- |2
                      some metempirical knowledge—philosophers continue to
- |2
                      contradict flatly the first principles of their prede- cessors and no vantage point is attained where we
- |2
                      can objectively assess these endemic metaphysical conflicts that
- |2
                      divide philosophers. To escape utter skepticism, we must be agnostics and
- |2
                      argue that such metaphysical and theological controversies lead to
- |2
                      “transcending the limits of reason” (p. 10). But the
- |2
                      only widely accepted characterization of these limits “comes in
- |2
                      substance to an exclusion of ontology” and an adherence to
- |2
                      empirically based truth-claims as the only legitimate truth-claims.
- |2
                  It will not help, Stephen argues, to maintain that the Numinous, i.e., the
- |2
                      divine, is essentially mysterious and that religious
- |2
                      understanding—a seeing through a glass darkly—is a
- |2
                      knowledge of something which is irreducibly and inescapably mysterious. In
- |2
                      such talk in such contexts, there is linguistic legerdemain: we call
- |2
                      our doubts mysteries and what is now being ap-
- |2
                      pealed to as “the mystery of faith” is but the
- |2
                          theolog- ical phrase for agnosticism (p.
- |2
                      22).
- |2
                  Stephen argues that one could believe knowledge of the standard types was
- |2
                      quite possible and indeed actual and remain skeptical about metaphysics. It
- |2
                      is just such a position that many (perhaps most) contem- porary philosophers would take. In taking this
- |2
                      position himself, Stephen came to believe that metaphysical claims are
- |2
                      “nothing but the bare husks of meaningless words.” To
- |2
                      gain genuine knowledge, we must firmly put aside such meaningless
- |2
                      metaphysical claims and recognize the more limited extent of our
- |2
                      knowledge claims. A firm recognition here will enable us to avoid
- |2
                      utter skepticism because we come to see that within
- |2
                       the limits of the experiential “we have been able to
- |2
                      discover certain reliable truths” and with them “we
- |2
                      shall find sufficient guidance for the needs of life” (p. 26).
- |2
                      So while we remain religious skeptics and skeptical of the claims of
- |2
                      transcendental metaphysics, we are not generally skeptical about man's
- |2
                      capacity to attain reliable knowledge. Yet it remains the case that
- |2
                      nothing is known or can be known, of the alleged “ultimate
- |2
                      reality”—the Infinite and Absolute—of tra- ditional metaphysics and natural theology
- |2
                      (p. 26). And thus nothing can be known of God.

- |2
                  Before moving on to a consideration of some twen- tieth-century formulations of agnosticism and to a
- |2
                      critical examination of all forms of agnosticism, let us consider briefly a
- |2
                      question that the above charac-
- |2
                      terization of Huxley and Stephen certainly should give rise to.
- |2
                      Given the correctness of the above criticisms of Judaism and Christianity,
- |2
                      do we not have good grounds for rejecting these religions and is not this
- |2
                      in effect an espousal of atheism rather than agnosticism?
- |2
                  We should answer differently for Huxley than we do for Stephen. Huxley's
- |2
                      arguments, if correct, would give us good grounds for rejecting
- |2
                      Christianity and Judaism; but they are not sufficient by themselves
- |2
                      for jettisoning a belief in God, though they would require us to
- |2
                      suspend judgment about the putative knowledge-
- |2
                          claim that God exists and created the world. But it must be
- |2
                      remembered that agnosticism is the general claim that we do not know and
- |2
                      (more typically) cannot know or have good grounds for believing that there
- |2
                      is a God. But to accept this is not to accept the claim that there is
- |2
                      no God, unless we accept the premiss that what cannot even in principle be
- |2
                      known cannot exist. This was not a premiss to which Huxley and Stephen
- |2
                      were committed. Rather they accepted the standard agnostic view that
- |2
                      since we cannot know or have good reasons for believing that God exists we
- |2
                      should suspend judg- ment concerning his
- |2
                      existence or nonexistence. More- over, as we
- |2
                      shall see, forms of Jewish and Christian fideism when linked with modern
- |2
                      biblical scholarship could accept at least most of Huxley's arguments
- |2
                      and still defend an acceptance of the Jewish or Christian faith.
- |2
                  Stephen's key arguments are more epistemologically oriented and are more
- |2
                      definitely committed to an empiricist account of meaning and the limits of
- |2
                          con- ceivability. As we shall see in
- |2
                      examining the conten- tions of some
- |2
                      contemporary critics of religion, it is more difficult to see what, given
- |2
                      the correctness of Stephen's own account, it could mean to affirm, deny, or even doubt the existence of God. The very
- |2
                      concept of God on such an account becomes problematical. And021
- |2
                       this makes what it would be to be an agnostic, an atheist, or a
- |2
                      theist problematical.
- |2
                  The cultural context in which we speak of religion is very different in the
- |2
                      twentieth century than it was in the nineteenth (cf. MacIntyre, Ricoeur).
- |2
                      For most twentieth-century people with even a minimal amount of
- |2
                      education, the authority of science has cut much deeper than it did in
- |2
                      previous centuries. The cosmo- logical
- |2
                      claims in the biblical stories are no longer taken at face value by the
- |2
                      overwhelming majority of edu- cated people both
- |2
                      religious and non-religious. Theolo- gians
- |2
                      working from within the circle of faith have carried out an extensive
- |2
                      program of de-mythologizing such biblical claims. Thus it is evident that
- |2
                      in one quite obvious respect the nineteenth-century agnostics have
- |2
                      clearly been victorious. There is no longer any serious attempt to defend
- |2
                      the truth of the cosmological claims in the type of biblical stories that
- |2
                      Huxley discusses.
- |2
                  However, what has not received such wide accept-
- |2
                      ance is the claim that the acceptance of such a de- mythologizing undermines Judaism and
- |2
                      Christianity and drives an honest man in the direction of agnos- ticism or atheism. Many would claim
- |2
                      that such de- mythologizing only
- |2
                      purifies Judaism and Christianity of extraneous cultural material. The
- |2
                      first thing to ask is whether or not a steady recognition of the fact
- |2
                      that these biblical stories are false supports agnosticism as strongly
- |2
                      as Huxley thinks it does.
- |2
                  Here the new historical perspective on the Bible is a crucial factor. The
- |2
                      very concept of the authority of the Bible undergoes a sea change with the
- |2
                      new look in historical scholarship. It is and has been widely
- |2
                      acknowledged both now and in the nineteenth century that Judaism and
- |2
                      Christianity are both integrally linked with certain historical claims.
- |2
                      They are not sufficient to establish the truth of either of these
- |2
                      religions, but they are necessary. Yet modern historical
- |2
                      research—to put it minimally—places many of these
- |2
                      historical claims in an equivocal light and makes it quite im- possible to accept claims about the literal
- |2
                      infallibility of the Bible. Conservative evangelicalists (funda- mentalists) try to resist this tide
- |2
                      and in reality still battle with Huxley. They reject the basic findings
- |2
                      of modern biblical scholarship and in contrast to mod- ernists treat the Bible not as a fallible and
- |2
                      myth-laden account of God's self-revelation in history but as a fully
- |2
                      inspired and infallible historical record. Conservative evangelicalists
- |2
                      agree with modernists that revelation consists in God's self-disclosure to
- |2
                      man, but they further believe that the Bible is an infallible testimony of
- |2
                      God's self-unveiling. Modernists by contrast believe that we must
- |2
                      discover what the crucial historical but yet divine events and realities
- |2
                      are like by a painstaking historical investigation of the biblical
- |2
                      material. This involves all
- |2
                       the techniques of modern historical research. The vari- ous accounts in the Bible must be sifted by
- |2
                      methodical inquiry and independently acquired knowledge of the culture
- |2
                      and the times must be used whenever possible.
- |2
                  Conservative evangelicalism is still strong as a cul-
- |2
                          tural phenomenon in North America, though it is steadily losing
- |2
                      strength. However it is not a serious influence in the major seminaries and
- |2
                      modernism has thoroughly won the day in the intellectually respect- able centers of Jewish and Christian
- |2
                      learning. Huxley's arguments do come into conflict with conservative
- |2
                      evangelicalism and his arguments about the plain fal-
- |2
                          sity, utter incoherence, and sometimes questionable morality of
- |2
                      the miracle stories and stories of Jesus' actions would have to be met by
- |2
                      such conservative evangelicalists. But the modernists would be on
- |2
                      Huxley's side here. So, for a large and respectable element of the Jewish
- |2
                      and Christian community, Huxley's arguments, which lead him to reject Christi- anity and accept agnosticism, are
- |2
                      accepted but not taken as at all undermining the foundations of
- |2
                      Judaism or Christianity.
- |2
                  Huxley's sort of endeavor, like the more systematic endeavors of David
- |2
                      Strauss, simply helps Christians rid the world of the historically
- |2
                      contingent cultural trap- pings of the
- |2
                      biblical writers. Once this has been cut away, modernists argue, the true
- |2
                      import of the biblical message can be seen as something of decisive
- |2
                      relevance that transcends the vicissitudes of time.
- |2
                  However, this is not all that should be said vis-à-vis the conflict
- |2
                      between science and religion and agnos-
- |2
                      ticism. It is often said that the conflict between science and
- |2
                      religion came to a head in the nineteenth century and now has been
- |2
                      transcended. Science, it is averred, is now seen to be neutral concerning
- |2
                      materialism or any other metaphysical thesis and theology—the
- |2
                          en- terprise of attempting to provide
- |2
                      ever deeper, clearer, and more reasonable statements and explications of
- |2
                      the truths of religion—is more sophisticated and less vul- nerable to attacks by science or
- |2
                      scientifically oriented thinkers. Still it may be the case that there
- |2
                      remain some conflicts between science and religion which have not been
- |2
                      overcome even with a sophisticated analysis of religion, where that
- |2
                      analysis takes the religions of the world and Christianity and Judaism in
- |2
                      particular to be making truth-claims.
- |2
                  Let us consider how such difficulties might arise. Most Christians, for
- |2
                      example, would want to claim as something central to their religion that
- |2
                      Christ rose from the dead and that there is a life after the death of
- |2
                      our earthly bodies. These claims seem at least to run athwart our
- |2
                      scientific understanding of the world so that it is difficult to know how
- |2
                      we could both accept scientific method as the most reliable method of settling022 disputes about the facts and accept these central Christian
- |2
                      claims. Moreover, given what science teaches us about the world, these
- |2
                      things could not happen or have happened. Yet it is also true that the by
- |2
                      now widely accepted new historical perspective on the Bible recognizes
- |2
                      and indeed stresses mythical and po- etical
- |2
                      strands in the biblical stories. And surely it is in this non-literal way
- |2
                      that the stories about demons, Jonah in the whale's belly, and Noah and his
- |2
                      ark are to be taken, but how far is this to be carried with the other
- |2
                      biblical claims? Are we to extend it to such central Christian claims as
- |2
                      “Christ rose from the Dead,” “Man shall
- |2
                      survive the death of his earthly body,” “God is in
- |2
                      Christ”? If we do, it becomes com-
- |2
                          pletely unclear as to what it could mean to speak of either the
- |2
                      truth or falsity of the Christian religion. If we do not, then it would
- |2
                      seem that some central Chris- tian
- |2
                      truth-claims do clash with scientific claims and orientations so that there
- |2
                      is after all a conflict between science and religion.
- |2
                  Given such a dilemma, the agnostic or atheist could then go on to claim that
- |2
                      either these key religious utterances do not function propositionally as
- |2
                          truth- claims at all or there is indeed
- |2
                      such a clash. But if there is such a clash, the scientific claims are
- |2
                      clearly the claims to be preferred, for of all the rival ways of
- |2
                      fixing belief, the scientific way of fixing belief is clearly the most
- |2
                      reliable. Thus if there are good empir- ical,
- |2
                      scientific reasons (as there are) for thinking that people who die are not
- |2
                      resurrected, that when our earthly bodies die we die, and that there is no
- |2
                      evidence at all, and indeed not even any clear meaning to the claim
- |2
                      that there are “resurrection bodies” and a
- |2
                          “res- urrection
- |2
                      world” utterly distinct from the cosmos, we have the strongest
- |2
                      of reasons for not accepting the Christian claim that “Christ
- |2
                      rose from the Dead.” The scientific beliefs in conflict with
- |2
                      that belief are ones that it would be foolish to jettison. But it is
- |2
                      only by a sacrifice of our scientific way of conceiving of things that
- |2
                      we could assent to such a central religious claim. Thus it is fair to say
- |2
                      that our scientific under- standing drives
- |2
                      us in the direction of either atheism or agnosticism.
- |2
                  Some contemporary theologians have responded to such contentions by arguing
- |2
                      that there are good con- ceptual reasons why
- |2
                      there could not be, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, such a
- |2
                      conflict. “Christ” is not equivalent to
- |2
                      “Jesus” but to “the son of God”
- |2
                      and God is not a physical reality. Christianity centers on a belief in a
- |2
                      deity who is beyond the world, who is creator of the world. But such a
- |2
                      reality is in principle, since it is transcendent to the cosmos, not
- |2
                      capable of being investigated scientifically but must
- |2
                       be understood in some other way. God in his proper
- |2
                      non-anthropomorphic forms is beyond the reach of evidence. Only crude
- |2
                      anthropomorphic forms of Christian belief could be disproved by modern
- |2
                          scien- tific investigations.
- |2
                  To believe that Christ rose from the dead is to be committed to a belief in
- |2
                      miracles. But, it has been forcefully argued by Ninian Smart, this does not
- |2
                          com- mit us to something which is
- |2
                      anti-scientific or that can be ruled out a priori
- |2
                      (Smart [1964], Ch. II; [1966], pp. 44-45). A miracle is an event of divine
- |2
                      significance which is an exception to at least one law of nature.
- |2
                      Scientific laws are not, it is important to remember, falsified by single
- |2
                      exceptions but only by a class of experimentally repeatable events. Thus we
- |2
                      can believe in the miracle of Christ's resurrection without clashing
- |2
                      with anything sanctioned by science. It is a dogma, the critic of
- |2
                      agnosticism could continue, to think that everything that can be known can
- |2
                      be known by the method of science or by simple observation. A thor- oughly scientific mind quite devoid of
- |2
                      credulity could remain committed to Judaism or Christianity, believe
- |2
                      in God, and accept such crucial miracle stories without abandoning a
- |2
                      scientific attitude, i.e., he could accept all the findings of science and
- |2
                      accept its authority as the most efficient method for ascertaining what is
- |2
                      the case when ascertaining what is the case comes to predicting and
- |2
                      retrodicting classes of experimentally repeatable events or processes.
- |2
                  Christians as well as agnostics can and do recognize the obscurity and
- |2
                      mysteriousness of religious claims. The Christian should go on to say that
- |2
                      a nonmysterious God, a God whose reality is evident, would not be the
- |2
                      God of Judeo-Christianity—the God to be accepted on faith with
- |2
                      fear and trembling. It is only for a God who moves in mysterious ways, that
- |2
                      the characteristic Jewish and Christian attitudes of discipleship, adora- tion, and faith are appropriate. If the
- |2
                      existence of God and what it was to act in accordance with His will
- |2
                      were perfectly evident or clearly establishable by hard intellectual work,
- |2
                      faith would lose its force and ration- ale.
- |2
                      Faith involves risk, trust, and commitment. Judaism or Christianity is not
- |2
                      something one simply must be- lieve in if one
- |2
                      will only think the matter through as clearly and honestly as possible.
- |2
                  What is evident is that the agnosticism of a Huxley and a Stephen at
- |2
                      least—and a Bertrand Russell as well—rests on a
- |2
                      philosophical view not dictated by science. James Ward saw this around the
- |2
                      turn of the century and argued in his Naturalism and
- |2
                          Agnosticism that agnosticism “is an inherently unstable
- |2
                      position” unless it is supplemented by some general
- |2
                      philosophical view such as materialism or idealism (p. 21). Yet it is023
- |2
                       just such overall views that Huxley and Stephen were anxious to
- |2
                      avoid and along Humean lines viewed with a thoroughgoing skepticism.
- |2
                  In sum, the claim is that only if such an overall philosophical view is
- |2
                      justified is it the case that there may be good grounds for being an
- |2
                      agnostic rather than a Christian or a Jew. The overall position
- |2
                      necessary for such a justification is either a position of empiricism
- |2
                      or materialism and if it is the former it must be a form of empiricism
- |2
                      which in Karl Popper's terms is also a scientism. By this we mean the claim
- |2
                      that there are no facts which science cannot explore: that what can- not at least in principle be known by the
- |2
                      method of science cannot be known. Where alternatively scien- tism is part of a reductive materialist
- |2
                      metaphysics, there is a commitment to what has been called an
- |2
                      “existence-monism,” namely, the view that there is
- |2
                      only one sort of level or order of existence and that is spatiotemporal
- |2
                      existence. That is to say, such an existence-monist believes that to exist
- |2
                      is to have a place in space-time. In support of this, he may point out
- |2
                      that we can always ask about a thing that is supposed to exist where it exists. This, it is claimed, indicates how
- |2
                      we in reality operate on materialist assumptions. And note that if that
- |2
                      question is not apposite, “exists” and its
- |2
                      equivalents are not being employed in their standard
- |2
                      senses, but are being used in a secondary sense as in “Ghosts
- |2
                      and gremlins exist merely in one's mind.” Besides
- |2
                      existence-monism there is the even more per-
- |2
                      vasive and distinctively empiricist position—a position
- |2
                      shared by the logical empiricists, by Bertrand Russell, and by John
- |2
                      Dewey—referred to as “methodological- monism”: to wit “that all
- |2
                      statements of fact are such that they can be investigated scientifically,
- |2
                      i.e., that they can in principle be falsified by
- |2
                      observation” (Smart [1966], p. 8).
- |2
                  However, critics of agnosticism have responded, as has Ninian Smart, by
- |2
                      pointing out that these philo- sophical
- |2
                      positions are vulnerable to a variety of fairly obvious and long-standing
- |2
                      criticisms. Perhaps these criticisms can be and have been met, but these
- |2
                      positions are highly controversial. If agnosticism is tied to them, do
- |2
                      we not have as good grounds for being skeptical of agnosticism as the
- |2
                      agnostics have for being skeptical of the claims of religion.
- |2
                  Some samplings of the grounds for being skeptical about the philosophical
- |2
                      underpinnings for agnosticism are these. When I suddenly remember that I
- |2
                      left my key in my car, it makes sense to speak of the space-time
- |2
                      location of my car but, it is at least plausibly argued, not of the
- |2
                      space-time location of my sudden thought. Moreover numbers exist but it
- |2
                      hardly makes sense to ask where they exist. It is
- |2
                      not the case that for all
- |2
                       standard uses of “exist” that to exist is to
- |2
                      have a place in space-time. Methodological-monism is also beset with
- |2
                      difficulties. There are in science theoretically unobservable entities and
- |2
                      “from quite early times, the central concepts of religion, such
- |2
                      as God and nirvana already include the notion that what they stand for
- |2
                      cannot literally be observed” (Smart [1962], p. 8). Moreover it
- |2
                      is not evident that we could falsify state-
- |2
                      ments such as “There are some graylings in
- |2
                      Michigan” or “Every human being has some neurotic
- |2
                      traits” or “Photons really exist, they are not simply
- |2
                      scientific fictions.” Yet we do recognize them (or so at least
- |2
                      it would seem) as intelligible statements of fact. Such considerations
- |2
                      lead Ninian Smart to claim confidently in his The Teacher
- |2
                          and Christian Belief (London, 1966) that “it remains
- |2
                      merely a dogma to claim that all facts are facts about moons and flowers
- |2
                      and humans and other denizens of the cosmos. There need be no general
- |2
                      embargo upon belief in a transcendent reality, pro-
- |2
                          vided such belief is not merely based on uncontrolled
- |2
                      speculation” (p. 51). Smart goes on to conclude that
- |2
                      “the exclusion of transcendent fact rests on a mere
- |2
                      decision” (p. 52). So it would appear, from what has been said
- |2
                      above, that agnosticism has no solid rational foundation.
- |2
                  The dialectic of the argument over agnosticism is not nearly at an end and
- |2
                      it shall be the burden of the argument here to establish that agnosticism
- |2
                      still has much to be said for it. First of all, even granting, for the
- |2
                      reasons outlined above, that neither the develop-
- |2
                          ment of science nor an appeal to scientism or empiri- cism establishes agnosticism, there are other consid- erations which give it strong
- |2
                      support. David Hume'sDialogues on Natural Religion (1779) and Immanuel
- |2
                      Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781) make it quite
- |2
                      evident that none of the proofs for the existence of God work, i.e., they
- |2
                      are not sound or reliable argu- ments.
- |2
                      Furthermore it should be noted that their ar-
- |2
                      guments do not for the most part depend for their force on
- |2
                      empiricist assumptions and they most certainly do not depend on the
- |2
                      development of science.
- |2
                  The most rigorous contemporary work in the philos-
- |2
                          ophy of religion has not always supported the detailed arguments
- |2
                      of Hume and Kant but it has for the most part supported their overall
- |2
                      conclusions on this issue. Alvin Plantinga, for example, in his God and Other Minds (1967) rejects rather thoroughly
- |2
                      the principles and assumptions of both existence-monism and metho- dological-monism and he
- |2
                      subjects the particulars of Hume's and Kant's views to careful criticism,
- |2
                      yet in the very course of giving a defense of what he takes to be the
- |2
                      rationality of Christian belief, he argues that none of the attempts at a
- |2
                      demonstration of the exist-024
- "                    \n"
- |2
                      ence of God have succeeded. He is echoed in this claim by such
- |2
                      important contemporary analytical theologians as John Hick and Diogenes
- |2
                      Allen. This lack of validated knowledge of the divine or lack of such
- |2
                      warranted belief strengthens the hand of the agnostics, though it is
- |2
                      also compatible with fideism or a revelationist view such as Barth's, which
- |2
                      holds that man on his own can know nothing of God but must rely utterly on
- |2
                      God's self-disclosure.
- "                \n"
- "                    \n"

                          IV
- "                    \n"
- |2
                  In the twentieth century a distinct element comes to the fore which counts
- |2
                      in favor of agnosticism but also gives it a particular twist. This new turn
- |2
                      leads to a reformulation of agnosticism. It states agnosticism in such
- |2
                      a manner that it becomes evident how it is a relevant response to one of
- |2
                      the major elements in contemporary philosophical perplexities over
- |2
                      religion.
- |2
                  We have hitherto been talking as if God-talk is used in certain central
- |2
                      contexts to make statements of whose truth-value we are in doubt. That is,
- |2
                      there is no doubt that they have a truth-value but there is a doubt
- |2
                      which truth-value they actually have. Theists think that at least some
- |2
                      of the key Jewish or Christian claims are true, atheists think they are
- |2
                      false, and traditional agnos- tics, as H. H.
- |2
                      Price puts it in his Belief (London, 1969), suspend
- |2
                      “judgement on the ground that we do not have sufficient evidence
- |2
                      to decide the question and so far as he [the agnostic] can tell there is no
- |2
                      likelihood that we ever shall have” (p. 455). But in the
- |2
                      twentieth century with certain analytic philosophers the question has
- |2
                      come to the fore about whether these key religious utterances have any
- |2
                      truth-value at all.
- |2
                  A. J. Ayer defending the modern variety of em-
- |2
                          piricism called “logical empiricism” argued in hisLanguage, Truth and Logic (London, 1935) that such
- |2
                      key religious utterances are devoid of cognitive mean-
- |2
                          ing. Such considerations lead Ayer to deny that he or anyone
- |2
                      taking such a position could be either a theist, an atheist, or even an
- |2
                      agnostic. In a well known passage Ayer comments that it is very important
- |2
                      not to confuse his view with agnosticism or atheism, for, as he puts
- |2
                      it,
- "                \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          It is a characteristic of an agnostic to hold that the existence of
- |2
                              a god is a possibility in which there is no good reason either to
- |2
                              believe or disbelieve; and it is characteristic of an atheist to
- |2
                              hold that it is at least probable that no god exists. And our view
- |2
                              that all utterances about the nature of God are nonsensical, so far
- |2
                              from being identical with, or even lending any support to, either
- |2
                              of these familiar contentions, is actually incompatible with them.
- |2
                              For if the assertion that there is a god is nonsensical, then the
- |2
                              atheist's assertion that there is no god is equally nonsensical,
- |2
                              since it is only a significant proposition that can be significantly
- |2
                               contradicted. As for the agnostic, although he refrains
- |2
                              from saying either that there is or that there is not a god,
- |2
                              he does not deny that the question whether a transcendent god
- |2
                              exists is a genuine question. He does not deny that the two
- |2
                              sentences “There is a transcendent god” and
- |2
                              “There is no transcendent god” express
- |2
                              propositions one of which is actually true and the other false. All
- |2
                              he says is that we have no means of telling which of them is true,
- |2
                              and therefore ought not to commit ourselves to either. But we have
- |2
                              seen that the sentences in question do not express
- |2
                              propositions at all. And this means that agnosticism also is ruled
- |2
                              out
- "                    \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          (p. 219).
- "                    \n"
- "                \n"
- |2
                  Ayer goes on to remark that the theist's putative claims are neither valid
- |2
                      nor invalid; they say nothing at all and thus the theist cannot rightly be
- |2
                      “accused of saying anything false, or anything for which he has
- |2
                      insufficient grounds” (ibid., p. 219). It is only when the
- |2
                      Christian, so to speak, turns meta-theologian and claims that in
- |2
                      asserting the existence of a Transcendent God he is expressing a genuine
- |2
                      proposition “that we are entitled to disagree with
- |2
                      him” (ibid.).
- |2
                  The central point Ayer is making is that such reli-
- |2
                          gious utterances do not assert anything and thus they can be
- |2
                      neither doubted, believed, nor even asserted to be false. With such
- |2
                      considerations pushed to the front, the key question becomes whether such
- |2
                      religious utterances have any informative content at all.
- |2
                  There is something very strange here. Ayer, as we have seen, does not regard
- |2
                      his position as atheistical or agnostic, for since such key religious
- |2
                      utterances could not even be false, they could not be intelligibly
- |2
                      denied and since they make no claim to be intelligibly questioned, they
- |2
                      could not be sensibly doubted. But, as Susan Stebbing rightly observed,
- |2
                      “the plain man would not find it easy to see the difference
- |2
                      between Mr. Ayer's non-atheism and the fool's atheism” (Steb- bing, p. 264). But before we say
- |2
                      “so much the worse for the plain man,” we should
- |2
                      remember that to believe that such key religious utterances are
- |2
                      unbelievable because nonsensical is even a more basic rejection of
- |2
                      religious belief than simply asserting the falsity of the putative
- |2
                      truth-claims of Christianity, but allowing for the possibility that they might be true.
- |2
                  Because of this altered conceptualization of the situ-
- |2
                          ation, Price, Edwards, and Nielsen have characterized both
- |2
                      agnosticism and atheism in a broader and more adequate way which takes into
- |2
                      account these problems about meaning. A contemporary agnostic who is
- |2
                      alert to such questions about meaning would maintain that judgments
- |2
                      concerning putatively assertive God-talk should be suspended for either of
- |2
                      two reasons, depend- ing on the exact nature
- |2
                      of the God-talk in question: (1) the claims, though genuine truth-claims,
- |2
                      are without sufficient evidence to warrant either their belief or025
- |2
                       categorical rejection, or (2) their meaning is so problem- atical that it is doubtful whether
- |2
                      there is something there which is sufficiently intelligible or coherent
- |2
                      to be believed. Where God is conceived somewhat an- thropomorphically the first
- |2
                      condition obtains and where God is conceived non-anthropomorphically
- |2
                      the second condition obtains. The contemporary agnostic believes that
- |2
                      “God” in the most typical religious employments is so
- |2
                      indeterminate in meaning that he must simply suspend judgment about whether
- |2
                      there is anything that it stands for which can intelligibly be
- |2
                      believed. His position, as Price points out, is like the traditional
- |2
                      agnostic's in being neutral between theism and atheism (p. 454). He
- |2
                      believes that neither such positive judgment is justified, but unlike a
- |2
                          contem- porary atheist, on the one
- |2
                      hand, he is not so confident of the unintelligibility or incoherence of
- |2
                      religious ut- terances that he feels that
- |2
                      religious belief is irrational and is to be rejected, but, on the other
- |2
                      hand, he does not believe one is justified in taking these problematic
- |2
                      utterances as being obscurely revelatory of Divine Truth. Neither atheism
- |2
                      nor any of the several forms of fideism is acceptable to him.
- |2
                  The contemporary agnostic sensitive to problems about the logical status of
- |2
                      religious utterances simply stresses that the reasonable and on the whole
- |2
                      justified course of action here is simply to suspend judgment. His
- |2
                      doubts are primarily doubts about the possibility of
- |2
                          there being anything to doubt, but, second-order as they are, they
- |2
                      have an effect similar to the effect of classical agnosticism and they lead
- |2
                      to a similar attitude toward religion. There is neither the classical
- |2
                      atheistic denial that there is anything to the claims of religion nor
- |2
                      is there the fideistic avowal that in spite of all their obscurity and seeming unintelligibility that there still is
- |2
                      something there worthy of belief. Instead there is a
- |2
                      genuine suspension of judgment.
- |2
                  The thing to ask is whether the doubts leading to a suspension of judgment
- |2
                      are actually sufficient tojustify such a suspension or, everything considered,
- |2
                      (1) would a leap of faith be more justified or (2) would the
- |2
                      overcoming of doubt in the direction of atheism be more reasonable? Or is
- |2
                      it the case that there is no way of making a rational decision here or of
- |2
                      reasonably deciding what one ought to do or believe?
- |2
                  It may indeed be true, as many a sophisticated theo-
- |2
                          logian has argued, that religious commitment is per- fectly compatible with a high degree of ignorance
- |2
                      about God and the nature—whatever that may mean—of
- |2
                      “ultimate reality.” But, if this is the case and if
- |2
                      our ignorance here is as invincible as much contem- porary philosophical argumentation would have us
- |2
                      believe, natural theology seems at least to be thor- oughly undermined. In trying to establish
- |2
                      whether the
- |2
                       world is contingent or non-contingent, whether there is or can
- |2
                      be something “beyond the world” upon which the world
- |2
                      in some sense depends, or whether there is or could be an unlimited reality
- |2
                      which is still in some sense personal, theological reasonings have been
- |2
                          no- toriously unsuccessful. About the
- |2
                      best that has been done is to establish that it is not entirely evident
- |2
                      that these questions are meaningless or utterly unan- swerable.
- |2
                  Here a Barthian turn away from natural theology is equally fruitless. To say
- |2
                      that man can by his own endeavors know nothing of God but simply must
- |2
                      await an unpredictable and rationally inexplicable self- disclosure of God—the
- |2
                      core notion of God revealing himself to man—is of no help, for
- |2
                      when we look at religions in an honest anthropological light, we will
- |2
                      see, when all the world is our stage, that we have multitudes of
- |2
                      conflicting alleged revelations with no means at all of deciding, without
- |2
                      the aid of natural theology or philosophical analysis, which, if any,
- |2
                      of these putative revelations are genuine revelations. It is true
- |2
                      enough that if something is actually a divine revelation, it cannot be
- |2
                      assessed by man, but must simply be accepted. But the agnostic reminds the
- |2
                          reve- lationist that we have a
- |2
                      multitude of conflicting candi- date
- |2
                      revelations with no means of reasonably deciding which one to accept. In
- |2
                      such a context a reasonable man will remain agnostic concerning such
- |2
                      matters. To simply accept the authorative claims of a Church in such a
- |2
                      circumstance is to fly in the face of reason.
- |2
                  The most crucial problem raised by the so-called truth-claims of Judaism and
- |2
                      Christianity is that of conceivability—to borrow a term that
- |2
                      Herbert Spencer used in the nineteenth century and thereby suggesting
- |2
                      that there are more lines of continuity between the old agnosticism and the
- |2
                      new than this essay has indi- cated. The incredibility—to use Spencer's
- |2
                      contrasting term—of these central religious claims is tied, at
- |2
                      least in part, to their inconceivability.
- |2
                      “God” is not supposed to refer to a being among
- |2
                      beings; by definition God is no finite object or process in the world. But
- |2
                      then how is the referring to be done? What are we really talking about
- |2
                      when we speak of God? How do we or can we fix the reference range of
- |2
                      “God”? God surely cannot be identified in the same
- |2
                      manner we identify the sole realities compatible with
- |2
                      existence-monism. There can be no picking God out as we would a dis- crete entity in space-time. Alternatively
- |2
                      there are theo- logians who will say that
- |2
                      when we come to recognize that it is just a brute fact that there is that
- |2
                      indefinitely immense collection of finite and contingent masses or
- |2
                      conglomerations of things, we use the phrase “the
- |2
                      world” to refer to, and when we recognize it could have been the
- |2
                      case—eternally the case—that there was026
- |2
                       no world at all, we can come quite naturally to feel puzzled
- |2
                      about why there is a world at all.
- |2
                  Is there anything that would account for the exist-
- |2
                          ence of all finite reality and not itself be a reality that
- |2
                      needed to be similarly explained? In speaking of God we are speaking of
- |2
                      such a reality, if indeed there is such a reality. We are concerned with a
- |2
                      reality not simply—as the world might be—infinite in
- |2
                      space and time, but a reality such that it would not make sense to ask
- |2
                          why it exists. Such a reality could not be a
- |2
                      physical reality.
- |2
                  In sum, we have, if we reflect at all, a developing sense of the contingency
- |2
                      of the world. The word “God” in part means, in Jewish
- |2
                      and Christian discourses, whatever it is that is non-contingent upon which
- |2
                      all these contingent realities continuously depend. God is the
- |2
                      completeness that would fill in the essential incom- pleteness of the world. We have feelings of de- pendency, creatureliness, finitude and in
- |2
                      having those feelings, it is argued, we have some sense of that which
- |2
                      is without limit. “God” refers to such alleged
- |2
                      ultimate realities and to something richer as well. But surely this,
- |2
                      the critic of agnosticism will reply, sufficiently fixes the reference
- |2
                      range of “God,” such that it would be a mistake to
- |2
                      assert that “God” is a term supposedly used to refer
- |2
                      to a referent but nothing coherently specifiable counts as a possible
- |2
                      referent for “God,” where “God”
- |2
                      has a non-anthropomorphic employment.
- |2
                  Surely such a referent is not something which can be clearly conceived, but,
- |2
                      as we have seen, a non- mysterious God
- |2
                      would not be the God of Judeo-
- |2
                      Christianity. But has language gone on a holiday? We certainly,
- "                    given our religious conditioning, have a \n"
- |2
                          feel- ing
- |2
                       that we understand what we are saying here. But do we? Perhaps, as
- |2
                      Axel Hägerström thought, “contin- gent thing,” “finite
- |2
                      thing,” and “finite reality” are
- |2
                      pleonastic. For anything at all that exists, we seem to be able to ask,
- |2
                      without being linguistically or con-
- |2
                      ceptually deviant, why it exists. “The world” or
- |2
                      “the cosmos” does not stand for an entity or a class of things, but is an umbrella term for all
- |2
                      those things and their structural relations that religious people call
- |2
                      “finite things” and many others just call
- |2
                      “things.” What are we talking about when we say there
- |2
                      is something infinite and utterly different from these “finite
- |2
                      realities” and that this “utterly other
- |2
                      reality” is neither physical nor temporal nor purely conceptual
- |2
                      nor simply imagi- nary, but, while being
- |2
                      unique and radically distinct from all these things, continuously sustains
- |2
                      all these “finite things” and is a mysterious
- |2
                      something upon which they are utterly dependent? Surely this is very
- |2
                      odd talk and “sustains” and
- |2
                      “dependent” have no un-
- |2
                          problematical use in this context.
- |2
                  These difficulties and a host of difficulties like them
- |2
                       make it doubtful whether the discourse used to spell out the
- |2
                      reference range of “God” is sufficiently intelli- gible to make such God-talk
- |2
                      coherent. An agnostic of the contemporary sort is a man who suspends judg- ment, oscillating between rejecting
- |2
                      God-talk as an irrational form of discourse containing at crucial junc- tures incoherent or rationally
- |2
                      unjustifiable putative truth-claims and accepting this discourse as
- |2
                      something which, obscure as it is, makes a sufficiently intelligible
- |2
                      and humanly important reference to be worthy of belief.
- |2
                  One reading of the situation is that the network of fundamental concepts
- |2
                      constitutive of nonanthropo- morphic
- |2
                      God-talk in Judeo-Christianity is so problem-
- |2
                          atical that the most reasonable thing to do is to opt for
- |2
                      atheism, particularly when we realize that we do not need these religions
- |2
                      or any religion to make sense of our lives or to buttress morality. But
- |2
                      agnosticism, particularly of the contemporary kind specified here,
- |2
                      need not be an evasion and perhaps is the most reason- able alternative for the individual who wishes, concern- ing an appraisal of competing world
- |2
                      views and ways of life, to operate on a principle of maximum caution.

               Dictionary of the History of IdeasAgnosticism is a philosophical and theological
- |2
                      concept which has been understood in various ways by different
- |2
                      philosophers and theologians. T. H. Huxley coined the term in 1869, and its
- |2
                      first home was in the disputes about science and religion, naturalism and
- |2
                          super- naturalism, that reached a
- |2
                      climax during the nineteenth century. To be an agnostic is to hold that
- |2
                      nothing can be known or at least that it is very unlikely that any- thing will be known or soundly believed
- |2
                      concerning whether God or any transcendent reality or state exists.It is very natural for certain people conditioned in certain ways to believe
- |2
                      that there must be some power “behind,”
- |2
                      “beyond,” or “underlying” the
- |2
                      universe which is responsible for its order and all the incredible
- |2
                      features that are observed and studied by the sciences even though these
- |2
                      same people will readily grant that we do not know that there is such a
- |2
                      power or have good grounds for believing that there is such a power.
- |2
                      While the admission of ignorance concerning things divine is usually made
- |2
                      by someone outside the circle of faith, it can and indeed has been made by
- |2
                      fideistic Jews and Christians as well.Some writers, e.g., Robert Flint and James Ward, so construed
- |2
                      “agnosticism” that (1) it was identified with
- |2
                      “philosophical skepticism” and (2) it allowed for
- |2
                      there being “theistic agnostics” and “Christian
- |2
                          agnos- tics.” However, the more
- |2
                      typical employment of “ag-
- |2
                      nosticism” is such that it would not be correct to count
- |2
                      as agnostics either fideistic believers or Jews and Chris- tians who claim that we can only gain knowledge of
- |2
                      God through some mystical awareness or “ineffable
- |2
                      knowledge.” It surely was this standard but more cir- cumscribed sense of
- |2
                      “agnosticism” that William James
- |2
                       had in mind when he made his famous remark in his essay
- |2
                      “The Will to Believe” that agnosticism was the worst
- |2
                      thing that “ever came out of the philosopher's
- |2
                      workshop.” Without implying or suggesting any sup- port at all for James's value judgment, we shall
- |2
                      construe agnosticism in this rather more typical manner. Given this
- |2
                      construal (1) “theistic agnosticism” is a contra- diction and thus one cannot be a Jew
- |2
                      or a Christian and be an agnostic and (2) also agnosticism is neutral vis-à-vis the claim that there can
- |2
                      be no philosophical knowledge or even scientific or common-sense knowl- edge. We shall then take agnosticism to
- |2
                      be the more limited claim that we either do not or cannot know that
- |2
                      God or any other transcendent reality or state exists and thus we should
- |2
                      suspend judgment concerning the assertion that God exists. That is to say,
- |2
                      the agnostic neither affirms nor denies it. This, as should be evident
- |2
                      from the above characterization, can take further specification and indeed
- |2
                      later such specifications will be supplied. But such a construal captures
- |2
                      in its char- acterization both what was
- |2
                      essentially at issue in the great agnostic debates in the nineteenth
- |2
                      century and the issue as it has come down to us.T. H. Huxley was by training a biologist, but he had strong philosophical
- |2
                      interests and as a champion of Darwinism he became a major intellectual
- |2
                      figure in the nineteenth century. In his “Science and
- |2
                      Christian Tradition” (in Collected
- |2
                      Essays), Huxley remarks that agnosticism is a method, a stance taken
- |2
                      toward putative religious truth-claims, the core of which is to refuse
- |2
                      to assent to religious doctrines for which there is no adequate evidence,
- |2
                      but to retain an open-mindedness about the possibility of sometime
- |2
                      attaining adequate evidence. We ought never to assert that we know a
- |2
                      proposition to be true or indeed even to assent to that proposition unless
- |2
                      we have adequate evidence to sup- port it.After his youthful reading of the Scottish meta-
- |2
                          physician William Hamilton's Philosophy of the
- |2
                              Un- conditioned (1829),
- |2
                      Huxley repeatedly returned to questions about the limits of our possible
- |2
                      knowledge and came, as did Leslie Stephen, to the empiricist
- |2
                      conclusion that we cannot know anything about God or any alleged states or
- |2
                      realities “beyond phenomena.” Whether there is a God,
- |2
                      a world of demons, an immor- tal soul, whether
- |2
                      indeed “the spiritual world” is other than human
- |2
                      fantasy or projection, were all taken by Huxley to be factual questions open to careful and systematic empirical
- |2
                      investigation. In short, however humanly important such questions were,
- |2
                      they were also “matters of the intellect” and in such
- |2
                      contexts theThis conviction is at the heart of his agnosticism. Huxley was convinced
- |2
                      that Kant and Hamilton had established that reason fails us—and
- |2
                      indeed must fail us—when we try to
- |2
                      establish that the world is finite in space or time or indefinite in space
- |2
                      or time, rational or irrational, an ordered whole or simply
- |2
                      manifesting certain ordered features but not something properly to be
- |2
                      called an ordered whole. Answers to such ques-
- |2
                      tions reveal something about our attitudes but can never provide us
- |2
                      with propositions we can justifiably claim to be true or even know to be
- |2
                      false. Agnosticism is a confession of honesty here. It is “the
- |2
                      only position for people who object to say that they know what they
- |2
                      are quite aware they do not know” (p. 210).Such skepticism concerning the truth-claims of reli-
- |2
                          gion and metaphysics, including, of course, meta- physical religiosity, should not be taken as a denial
- |2
                      that there can be reliable knowledge. Rather Huxley argued, as John
- |2
                      Dewey did far more systematically later, that we can and do gain
- |2
                      experimental and ex- periential knowledge
- |2
                      of nature, including human na- ture, and that
- |2
                      this, by contrast with so-called “super- natural knowledge,” becomes increasingly more
- |2
                          exten- sive and reliable. And while
- |2
                      remaining an agnostic, Huxley saw in science—basically the
- |2
                      scientific way of fixing belief—a fundamental and well grounded
- |2
                          chal- lenge to the authority of the theory
- |2
                      of the “spiritual world.”Whatever may have been the case in the seventeenth century, there was in
- |2
                      Huxley's time a state of war between science and religion. Huxley took
- |2
                      science to be a challenge to claims of biblical infallibility and
- |2
                      revelation. The whole supernatural world view built on the authority of the
- |2
                      Bible and revelation must come
- |2
                       under scientific scrutiny and when this is done it be- comes gradually apparent that the use of the
- |2
                      scientific method and appeals to scientific canons of criticism give
- |2
                      us a far more reliable method of settling belief than do the scriptures and
- |2
                      revelation.To commit ourselves to the Bible as an infallible authority is to commit
- |2
                      ourselves to a world view in which we must believe that devils were cast
- |2
                      out of a man and went into a herd of swine, that the deluge was
- |2
                      universal, that the world was made in six days, and the like. Yet such
- |2
                      claims are plainly and massively contravened by our actual empirical
- |2
                      knowledge such that they are quite beyond the boundaries of respon- sible belief. About such matters,
- |2
                      Huxley argues, we ought not to be at all agnostic. Moreover, we cannot
- |2
                      take them simply as myths, important for the biblical and Christian
- |2
                      understanding of the world, if we are to take seriously biblical
- |2
                      infallibility and the authority of revelation. For the Jewish-Christian
- |2
                      world view to establish its validity, it must provide us with adequate
- |2
                      grounds for believing that there are demons. But there is no good evidence
- |2
                      for such alleged realities and to believe in them is the grossest form of
- |2
                      superstition (Huxley, p. 215).Even if we fall back on a severe Christology, we are still in difficulties,
- |2
                      for it is evident enough that Jesus believed in demons and if we are to
- |2
                      adopt a radical Christology and take Jesus as our infallible guide to
- |2
                      the divine, we are going to have to accept such super- stitious beliefs. Such beliefs affront not only our
- |2
                          intel- lect—our credibility
- |2
                      concerning what it is reasonable to believe—they also affront
- |2
                      our moral sense as well (p. 226). Yet once we give up the Gospel claim
- |2
                      that there are “demons who can be transferred from a man to
- |2
                      a pig,” the other stories of “demonic possession fall

                      under suspicion.” Once we start on this slide, once we challenge
- |2
                      the ultimate authority of the Bible, and follow experimental and scientific
- |2
                      procedures, the ground for the whole Judeo-Christian world view is
- |2
                      undermined.Huxley obviously thinks its credibility and proba-
- |2
                          bility is of a very low order; an order which would make
- |2
                      Christian or Jewish belief quite impossible for a reasonable and tolerably
- |2
                      well informed man. Those who claim to know that there are such unseen
- |2
                      and indeed utterly unseeable realities, are very likely peo- ple who have taken “cunning phrases for
- |2
                      answers,” where real answers are “not merely actually
- |2
                          impossi- ble, but theoretically
- |2
                      inconceivable.” Yet as an agnostic one must
- |2
                      always—even for such problematical trans- cendental claims—remain open to conviction
- |2
                      where evidence can be brought to establish the truth of such
- |2
                      transcendent religious claims.Leslie Stephen in his neglected An Agnostic's019
- |2
                           Apology (1893) remarks that he uses
- |2
                      “agnostic” in a sense close to that of T. H. Huxley.
- |2
                      To be an agnostic, according to Stephen, is to reject what he calls
- |2
                          “Dog- matic Atheism,”
- |2
                      i.e., “the doctrine that there is no God, whatever is meant by
- |2
                      God...”; it is, instead, (1) to affirm “what no one
- |2
                      denies,” namely “that there are limits to the sphere
- |2
                      of human intelligence” and (2) also to affirm the controversial
- |2
                      empiricist thesis “that those limits are such as to exclude at
- |2
                      least what Lewes called 'Metempirical knowledge'” (p. 1).
- |2
                      (“Metempirical knowledge” is meant to designate all
- |2
                      forms of knowl- edge of a transcendent,
- |2
                      numinal, nonempirical sort.)Stephen makes apparent the empiricist commit-
- |2
                      ments of his conception of agnosticism in charac- terizing gnosticism, the view agnosticism is
- |2
                      deliberately set against. To be a gnostic is to believe that “we
- |2
                      can attain truths not capable of verification and not needing
- |2
                      verification by actual experiment or observation” (ibid., pp.
- |2
                      1-2). In gaining such a knowledge gnostics in opposition to both Hume and
- |2
                      Kant claim that by the use of our reason we can attain a knowledge
- |2
                      that transcends “the narrow limits of experience” (p.
- |2
                      1). But the agnostic, firmly in the empiricist tradition, denies that
- |2
                      there can be any knowledge of the world, includ-
- |2
                      ing anything about its origin and destiny, which tran- scends experience and comprehends “the sorry
- |2
                      scheme of things entire.” Such putative knowledge, Stephen
- |2
                      maintains, is illusory and not something “essential to the
- |2
                      highest interests of mankind,” providing us, as speculative
- |2
                      metaphysicians believe, with the solution to “the dark riddle of
- |2
                      the universe” (p. 2).In a manner that anticipates the challenge to the claims of religion and
- |2
                      metaphysics made by the logical empiricists, Stephen says that in addition
- |2
                      to the prob- lem of whether they can establish
- |2
                      the truth or probable truth of “religious
- |2
                      truth-claims” there is the further
- |2
                      consideration—actually a logically prior question—of
- |2
                      whether such putative claims “have any meaning” (p.
- |2
                      3).It should be noted that Stephen does not begin “An Agnostic's
- |2
                      Apology” by discussing semantical diffi- culties in putative religious truth-claims but starts
- |2
                      with problems connected with what W. K. Clifford was later to call
- |2
                      “the ethics of belief.” We indeed would all
- |2
                      want—if we could do it honestly—to accept the claim
- |2
                      that “evil is transitory... good eternal” and that
- |2
                      the “world is really an embodiment of love and wisdom,
- |2
                      however dark it may appear to us” (p. 2). But the rub is that
- |2
                      many of us cannot believe that and in a question of such inestimable human
- |2
                      value, we have “the most sacred obligations to recognize the
- |2
                      facts” and make our judgments in accordance with the facts. But
- |2
                      the facts do not give us grounds for confidence in the viability of
- |2
                      Judeo-Christian beliefs. Rather we are
- |2
                       strongly inclined when we inspect these beliefs to believe they
- |2
                      are wish fulfillments. And while it may indeed be true that for the moment
- |2
                      dreams may be pleasanter than realities, it is also true that if we
- |2
                      are bent on attaining a more permanent measure of happi- ness, it “must be won by adapting our lives
- |2
                      to the realities,” for we know from experience that
- |2
                      illusory consolations “are the bitterest of
- |2
                      mockeries” (ibid.). The religious platitudes “Pain is
- |2
                      not an evil,” “Death is not a separation,”
- |2
                      and “Sickness is but a blessing in disguise” have
- |2
                      tortured sufferers far more than “the gloomiest speculations of
- |2
                      avowed pessimists” (ibid.).However, the problem of meaning cuts to a deeper
- |2
                      conceptual level than do such arguments about the ethics of belief. Where
- |2
                      Judeo-Christianity does not have a fideistic basis, it is committed to what
- |2
                      Stephen calls gnosticism. But does not such a doctrine fail
- |2
                      “to recognize the limits of possible knowledge” and
- |2
                      in trying to transcend these limits does it not in effect commit the
- |2
                      gnostic to pseudo-propositions which are devoid of literal meaning? Logical
- |2
                      empiricists later answered this question in the affirmative and while
- |2
                      it is not crystal clear that Stephen's answer is quite that definite,
- |2
                      it would appear that this is what he wants to maintain. And if that is what
- |2
                      Stephen is maintaining, there can, of course, be no knowledge of the
- |2
                      divine.Stephen raises this key question concerning the intelligibility of such
- |2
                      gnostic God-talk, but he does little with it. Instead he focuses on some
- |2
                      key questions concerning attempts by theologians to undermine
- |2
                      agnosticism. He first points out that an appeal to rev- elation is no answer to the agnostic's denial that we
- |2
                      have knowledge of transcendent realities or states, for in claiming to rely
- |2
                      exclusively on revelation these theologians acknowledge that
- |2
                      “natural man can know nothing of the Divine nature.”
- |2
                      But this Stephen replies, is not only to grant but in effect to assert the
- |2
                      agnostic's fundamental principle (p. 5). He points out that H. L.
- |2
                      Mansel in effect and in substance affirms agnosticism and that Cardinal
- |2
                      Newman with his appeal to the testimony of conscience does not provide a
- |2
                      reliable argument on which to base a belief in God nor does he
- |2
                      undermine the agnostic's position, for “the voice of conscience
- |2
                      has been very differently interpreted.” Some of these
- |2
                      interpretations, secular though they be, have all the appearances of being
- |2
                      at least as valid as Newman's, for all that Newman or anyone else has
- |2
                      shown. Moreover, on any reasonable reading of a prin-
- |2
                          ciple of parsimony, they are far simpler than Newman's
- |2
                      interpretation. Thus Newman's arguments in reality prove, as do Mansel's,
- |2
                      that a man ought to be an agnostic concerning such ultimate questions
- |2
                      where reason remains his guide and where he does not make an appeal to
- |2
                      the authority of the Church. They, ofLike Huxley, and like Hume before him, Stephen is skeptical of the a priori arguments of metaphysics and natural
- |2
                      theology. “There is not a single proof of natural
- |2
                      theology,” he asserts, “of which the negative has not
- |2
                      been maintained as vigorously as the affirmative” (p. 9). In
- |2
                      such a context, where there is no substantial agreement, but just endless
- |2
                      and irre- solvable philosophical
- |2
                      controversy, it is the duty of a reasonable man to profess ignorance (p.
- |2
                      9). In trying to escape the bounds of sense—in trying to gain
- |2
                      some metempirical knowledge—philosophers continue to
- |2
                      contradict flatly the first principles of their prede- cessors and no vantage point is attained where we
- |2
                      can objectively assess these endemic metaphysical conflicts that
- |2
                      divide philosophers. To escape utter skepticism, we must be agnostics and
- |2
                      argue that such metaphysical and theological controversies lead to
- |2
                      “transcending the limits of reason” (p. 10). But the
- |2
                      only widely accepted characterization of these limits “comes in
- |2
                      substance to an exclusion of ontology” and an adherence to
- |2
                      empirically based truth-claims as the only legitimate truth-claims.It will not help, Stephen argues, to maintain that the Numinous, i.e., the
- |2
                      divine, is essentially mysterious and that religious
- |2
                      understanding—a seeing through a glass darkly—is a
- |2
                      knowledge of something which is irreducibly and inescapably mysterious. In
- |2
                      such talk in such contexts, there is linguistic legerdemain: we call
- |2
                      our doubts mysteries and what is now being ap-
- |2
                      pealed to as “the mystery of faith” is but the
- |2
                          theolog- ical phrase for agnosticism (p.
- |2
                      22).Stephen argues that one could believe knowledge of the standard types was
- |2
                      quite possible and indeed actual and remain skeptical about metaphysics. It
- |2
                      is just such a position that many (perhaps most) contem- porary philosophers would take. In taking this
- |2
                      position himself, Stephen came to believe that metaphysical claims are
- |2
                      “nothing but the bare husks of meaningless words.” To
- |2
                      gain genuine knowledge, we must firmly put aside such meaningless
- |2
                      metaphysical claims and recognize the more limited extent of our
- |2
                      knowledge claims. A firm recognition here will enable us to avoid
- |2
                      utter skepticism because we come to see that within
- |2
                       the limits of the experiential “we have been able to
- |2
                      discover certain reliable truths” and with them “we
- |2
                      shall find sufficient guidance for the needs of life” (p. 26).
- |2
                      So while we remain religious skeptics and skeptical of the claims of
- |2
                      transcendental metaphysics, we are not generally skeptical about man's
- |2
                      capacity to attain reliable knowledge. Yet it remains the case that
- |2
                      nothing is known or can be known, of the alleged “ultimate
- |2
                      reality”—the Infinite and Absolute—of tra- ditional metaphysics and natural theology
- |2
                      (p. 26). And thus nothing can be known of God.Before moving on to a consideration of some twen- tieth-century formulations of agnosticism and to a
- |2
                      critical examination of all forms of agnosticism, let us consider briefly a
- |2
                      question that the above charac-
- |2
                      terization of Huxley and Stephen certainly should give rise to.
- |2
                      Given the correctness of the above criticisms of Judaism and Christianity,
- |2
                      do we not have good grounds for rejecting these religions and is not this
- |2
                      in effect an espousal of atheism rather than agnosticism?We should answer differently for Huxley than we do for Stephen. Huxley's
- |2
                      arguments, if correct, would give us good grounds for rejecting
- |2
                      Christianity and Judaism; but they are not sufficient by themselves
- |2
                      for jettisoning a belief in God, though they would require us to
- |2
                      suspend judgment about the putative knowledge-
- |2
                          claim that God exists and created the world. But it must be
- |2
                      remembered that agnosticism is the general claim that we do not know and
- |2
                      (more typically) cannot know or have good grounds for believing that there
- |2
                      is a God. But to accept this is not to accept the claim that there is
- |2
                      no God, unless we accept the premiss that what cannot even in principle be
- |2
                      known cannot exist. This was not a premiss to which Huxley and Stephen
- |2
                      were committed. Rather they accepted the standard agnostic view that
- |2
                      since we cannot know or have good reasons for believing that God exists we
- |2
                      should suspend judg- ment concerning his
- |2
                      existence or nonexistence. More- over, as we
- |2
                      shall see, forms of Jewish and Christian fideism when linked with modern
- |2
                      biblical scholarship could accept at least most of Huxley's arguments
- |2
                      and still defend an acceptance of the Jewish or Christian faith.Stephen's key arguments are more epistemologically oriented and are more
- |2
                      definitely committed to an empiricist account of meaning and the limits of
- |2
                          con- ceivability. As we shall see in
- |2
                      examining the conten- tions of some
- |2
                      contemporary critics of religion, it is more difficult to see what, given
- |2
                      the correctness of Stephen's own account, it could mean to affirm, deny, or even doubt the existence of God. The very
- |2
                      concept of God on such an account becomes problematical. AndThe cultural context in which we speak of religion is very different in the
- |2
                      twentieth century than it was in the nineteenth (cf. MacIntyre, Ricoeur).
- |2
                      For most twentieth-century people with even a minimal amount of
- |2
                      education, the authority of science has cut much deeper than it did in
- |2
                      previous centuries. The cosmo- logical
- |2
                      claims in the biblical stories are no longer taken at face value by the
- |2
                      overwhelming majority of edu- cated people both
- |2
                      religious and non-religious. Theolo- gians
- |2
                      working from within the circle of faith have carried out an extensive
- |2
                      program of de-mythologizing such biblical claims. Thus it is evident that
- |2
                      in one quite obvious respect the nineteenth-century agnostics have
- |2
                      clearly been victorious. There is no longer any serious attempt to defend
- |2
                      the truth of the cosmological claims in the type of biblical stories that
- |2
                      Huxley discusses.However, what has not received such wide accept-
- |2
                      ance is the claim that the acceptance of such a de- mythologizing undermines Judaism and
- |2
                      Christianity and drives an honest man in the direction of agnos- ticism or atheism. Many would claim
- |2
                      that such de- mythologizing only
- |2
                      purifies Judaism and Christianity of extraneous cultural material. The
- |2
                      first thing to ask is whether or not a steady recognition of the fact
- |2
                      that these biblical stories are false supports agnosticism as strongly
- |2
                      as Huxley thinks it does.Here the new historical perspective on the Bible is a crucial factor. The
- |2
                      very concept of the authority of the Bible undergoes a sea change with the
- |2
                      new look in historical scholarship. It is and has been widely
- |2
                      acknowledged both now and in the nineteenth century that Judaism and
- |2
                      Christianity are both integrally linked with certain historical claims.
- |2
                      They are not sufficient to establish the truth of either of these
- |2
                      religions, but they are necessary. Yet modern historical
- |2
                      research—to put it minimally—places many of these
- |2
                      historical claims in an equivocal light and makes it quite im- possible to accept claims about the literal
- |2
                      infallibility of the Bible. Conservative evangelicalists (funda- mentalists) try to resist this tide
- |2
                      and in reality still battle with Huxley. They reject the basic findings
- |2
                      of modern biblical scholarship and in contrast to mod- ernists treat the Bible not as a fallible and
- |2
                      myth-laden account of God's self-revelation in history but as a fully
- |2
                      inspired and infallible historical record. Conservative evangelicalists
- |2
                      agree with modernists that revelation consists in God's self-disclosure to
- |2
                      man, but they further believe that the Bible is an infallible testimony of
- |2
                      God's self-unveiling. Modernists by contrast believe that we must
- |2
                      discover what the crucial historical but yet divine events and realities
- |2
                      are like by a painstaking historical investigation of the biblical
- |2
                      material. This involves all
- |2
                       the techniques of modern historical research. The vari- ous accounts in the Bible must be sifted by
- |2
                      methodical inquiry and independently acquired knowledge of the culture
- |2
                      and the times must be used whenever possible.Conservative evangelicalism is still strong as a cul-
- |2
                          tural phenomenon in North America, though it is steadily losing
- |2
                      strength. However it is not a serious influence in the major seminaries and
- |2
                      modernism has thoroughly won the day in the intellectually respect- able centers of Jewish and Christian
- |2
                      learning. Huxley's arguments do come into conflict with conservative
- |2
                      evangelicalism and his arguments about the plain fal-
- |2
                          sity, utter incoherence, and sometimes questionable morality of
- |2
                      the miracle stories and stories of Jesus' actions would have to be met by
- |2
                      such conservative evangelicalists. But the modernists would be on
- |2
                      Huxley's side here. So, for a large and respectable element of the Jewish
- |2
                      and Christian community, Huxley's arguments, which lead him to reject Christi- anity and accept agnosticism, are
- |2
                      accepted but not taken as at all undermining the foundations of
- |2
                      Judaism or Christianity.Huxley's sort of endeavor, like the more systematic endeavors of David
- |2
                      Strauss, simply helps Christians rid the world of the historically
- |2
                      contingent cultural trap- pings of the
- |2
                      biblical writers. Once this has been cut away, modernists argue, the true
- |2
                      import of the biblical message can be seen as something of decisive
- |2
                      relevance that transcends the vicissitudes of time.However, this is not all that should be said vis-à-vis the conflict
- |2
                      between science and religion and agnos-
- |2
                      ticism. It is often said that the conflict between science and
- |2
                      religion came to a head in the nineteenth century and now has been
- |2
                      transcended. Science, it is averred, is now seen to be neutral concerning
- |2
                      materialism or any other metaphysical thesis and theology—the
- |2
                          en- terprise of attempting to provide
- |2
                      ever deeper, clearer, and more reasonable statements and explications of
- |2
                      the truths of religion—is more sophisticated and less vul- nerable to attacks by science or
- |2
                      scientifically oriented thinkers. Still it may be the case that there
- |2
                      remain some conflicts between science and religion which have not been
- |2
                      overcome even with a sophisticated analysis of religion, where that
- |2
                      analysis takes the religions of the world and Christianity and Judaism in
- |2
                      particular to be making truth-claims.Let us consider how such difficulties might arise. Most Christians, for
- |2
                      example, would want to claim as something central to their religion that
- |2
                      Christ rose from the dead and that there is a life after the death of
- |2
                      our earthly bodies. These claims seem at least to run athwart our
- |2
                      scientific understanding of the world so that it is difficult to know how
- |2
                      we could both accept scientific method as the most reliable method of settlingGiven such a dilemma, the agnostic or atheist could then go on to claim that
- |2
                      either these key religious utterances do not function propositionally as
- |2
                          truth- claims at all or there is indeed
- |2
                      such a clash. But if there is such a clash, the scientific claims are
- |2
                      clearly the claims to be preferred, for of all the rival ways of
- |2
                      fixing belief, the scientific way of fixing belief is clearly the most
- |2
                      reliable. Thus if there are good empir- ical,
- |2
                      scientific reasons (as there are) for thinking that people who die are not
- |2
                      resurrected, that when our earthly bodies die we die, and that there is no
- |2
                      evidence at all, and indeed not even any clear meaning to the claim
- |2
                      that there are “resurrection bodies” and a
- |2
                          “res- urrection
- |2
                      world” utterly distinct from the cosmos, we have the strongest
- |2
                      of reasons for not accepting the Christian claim that “Christ
- |2
                      rose from the Dead.” The scientific beliefs in conflict with
- |2
                      that belief are ones that it would be foolish to jettison. But it is
- |2
                      only by a sacrifice of our scientific way of conceiving of things that
- |2
                      we could assent to such a central religious claim. Thus it is fair to say
- |2
                      that our scientific under- standing drives
- |2
                      us in the direction of either atheism or agnosticism.Some contemporary theologians have responded to such contentions by arguing
- |2
                      that there are good con- ceptual reasons why
- |2
                      there could not be, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, such a
- |2
                      conflict. “Christ” is not equivalent to
- |2
                      “Jesus” but to “the son of God”
- |2
                      and God is not a physical reality. Christianity centers on a belief in a
- |2
                      deity who is beyond the world, who is creator of the world. But such a
- |2
                      reality is in principle, since it is transcendent to the cosmos, not
- |2
                      capable of being investigated scientifically but must
- |2
                       be understood in some other way. God in his proper
- |2
                      non-anthropomorphic forms is beyond the reach of evidence. Only crude
- |2
                      anthropomorphic forms of Christian belief could be disproved by modern
- |2
                          scien- tific investigations.To believe that Christ rose from the dead is to be committed to a belief in
- |2
                      miracles. But, it has been forcefully argued by Ninian Smart, this does not
- |2
                          com- mit us to something which is
- |2
                      anti-scientific or that can be ruled out a priori
- |2
                      (Smart [1964], Ch. II; [1966], pp. 44-45). A miracle is an event of divine
- |2
                      significance which is an exception to at least one law of nature.
- |2
                      Scientific laws are not, it is important to remember, falsified by single
- |2
                      exceptions but only by a class of experimentally repeatable events. Thus we
- |2
                      can believe in the miracle of Christ's resurrection without clashing
- |2
                      with anything sanctioned by science. It is a dogma, the critic of
- |2
                      agnosticism could continue, to think that everything that can be known can
- |2
                      be known by the method of science or by simple observation. A thor- oughly scientific mind quite devoid of
- |2
                      credulity could remain committed to Judaism or Christianity, believe
- |2
                      in God, and accept such crucial miracle stories without abandoning a
- |2
                      scientific attitude, i.e., he could accept all the findings of science and
- |2
                      accept its authority as the most efficient method for ascertaining what is
- |2
                      the case when ascertaining what is the case comes to predicting and
- |2
                      retrodicting classes of experimentally repeatable events or processes.Christians as well as agnostics can and do recognize the obscurity and
- |2
                      mysteriousness of religious claims. The Christian should go on to say that
- |2
                      a nonmysterious God, a God whose reality is evident, would not be the
- |2
                      God of Judeo-Christianity—the God to be accepted on faith with
- |2
                      fear and trembling. It is only for a God who moves in mysterious ways, that
- |2
                      the characteristic Jewish and Christian attitudes of discipleship, adora- tion, and faith are appropriate. If the
- |2
                      existence of God and what it was to act in accordance with His will
- |2
                      were perfectly evident or clearly establishable by hard intellectual work,
- |2
                      faith would lose its force and ration- ale.
- |2
                      Faith involves risk, trust, and commitment. Judaism or Christianity is not
- |2
                      something one simply must be- lieve in if one
- |2
                      will only think the matter through as clearly and honestly as possible.What is evident is that the agnosticism of a Huxley and a Stephen at
- |2
                      least—and a Bertrand Russell as well—rests on a
- |2
                      philosophical view not dictated by science. James Ward saw this around the
- |2
                      turn of the century and argued in his Naturalism and
- |2
                          Agnosticism that agnosticism “is an inherently unstable
- |2
                      position” unless it is supplemented by some general
- |2
                      philosophical view such as materialism or idealism (p. 21). Yet it isIn sum, the claim is that only if such an overall philosophical view is
- |2
                      justified is it the case that there may be good grounds for being an
- |2
                      agnostic rather than a Christian or a Jew. The overall position
- |2
                      necessary for such a justification is either a position of empiricism
- |2
                      or materialism and if it is the former it must be a form of empiricism
- |2
                      which in Karl Popper's terms is also a scientism. By this we mean the claim
- |2
                      that there are no facts which science cannot explore: that what can- not at least in principle be known by the
- |2
                      method of science cannot be known. Where alternatively scien- tism is part of a reductive materialist
- |2
                      metaphysics, there is a commitment to what has been called an
- |2
                      “existence-monism,” namely, the view that there is
- |2
                      only one sort of level or order of existence and that is spatiotemporal
- |2
                      existence. That is to say, such an existence-monist believes that to exist
- |2
                      is to have a place in space-time. In support of this, he may point out
- |2
                      that we can always ask about a thing that is supposed to exist where it exists. This, it is claimed, indicates how
- |2
                      we in reality operate on materialist assumptions. And note that if that
- |2
                      question is not apposite, “exists” and its
- |2
                      equivalents are not being employed in their standard
- |2
                      senses, but are being used in a secondary sense as in “Ghosts
- |2
                      and gremlins exist merely in one's mind.” Besides
- |2
                      existence-monism there is the even more per-
- |2
                      vasive and distinctively empiricist position—a position
- |2
                      shared by the logical empiricists, by Bertrand Russell, and by John
- |2
                      Dewey—referred to as “methodological- monism”: to wit “that all
- |2
                      statements of fact are such that they can be investigated scientifically,
- |2
                      i.e., that they can in principle be falsified by
- |2
                      observation” (Smart [1966], p. 8).However, critics of agnosticism have responded, as has Ninian Smart, by
- |2
                      pointing out that these philo- sophical
- |2
                      positions are vulnerable to a variety of fairly obvious and long-standing
- |2
                      criticisms. Perhaps these criticisms can be and have been met, but these
- |2
                      positions are highly controversial. If agnosticism is tied to them, do
- |2
                      we not have as good grounds for being skeptical of agnosticism as the
- |2
                      agnostics have for being skeptical of the claims of religion.Some samplings of the grounds for being skeptical about the philosophical
- |2
                      underpinnings for agnosticism are these. When I suddenly remember that I
- |2
                      left my key in my car, it makes sense to speak of the space-time
- |2
                      location of my car but, it is at least plausibly argued, not of the
- |2
                      space-time location of my sudden thought. Moreover numbers exist but it
- |2
                      hardly makes sense to ask where they exist. It is
- |2
                      not the case that for all
- |2
                       standard uses of “exist” that to exist is to
- |2
                      have a place in space-time. Methodological-monism is also beset with
- |2
                      difficulties. There are in science theoretically unobservable entities and
- |2
                      “from quite early times, the central concepts of religion, such
- |2
                      as God and nirvana already include the notion that what they stand for
- |2
                      cannot literally be observed” (Smart [1962], p. 8). Moreover it
- |2
                      is not evident that we could falsify state-
- |2
                      ments such as “There are some graylings in
- |2
                      Michigan” or “Every human being has some neurotic
- |2
                      traits” or “Photons really exist, they are not simply
- |2
                      scientific fictions.” Yet we do recognize them (or so at least
- |2
                      it would seem) as intelligible statements of fact. Such considerations
- |2
                      lead Ninian Smart to claim confidently in his The Teacher
- |2
                          and Christian Belief (London, 1966) that “it remains
- |2
                      merely a dogma to claim that all facts are facts about moons and flowers
- |2
                      and humans and other denizens of the cosmos. There need be no general
- |2
                      embargo upon belief in a transcendent reality, pro-
- |2
                          vided such belief is not merely based on uncontrolled
- |2
                      speculation” (p. 51). Smart goes on to conclude that
- |2
                      “the exclusion of transcendent fact rests on a mere
- |2
                      decision” (p. 52). So it would appear, from what has been said
- |2
                      above, that agnosticism has no solid rational foundation.The dialectic of the argument over agnosticism is not nearly at an end and
- |2
                      it shall be the burden of the argument here to establish that agnosticism
- |2
                      still has much to be said for it. First of all, even granting, for the
- |2
                      reasons outlined above, that neither the develop-
- |2
                          ment of science nor an appeal to scientism or empiri- cism establishes agnosticism, there are other consid- erations which give it strong
- |2
                      support. David Hume'sDialogues on Natural Religion (1779) and Immanuel
- |2
                      Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781) make it quite
- |2
                      evident that none of the proofs for the existence of God work, i.e., they
- |2
                      are not sound or reliable argu- ments.

                      Furthermore it should be noted that their ar-
- |2
                      guments do not for the most part depend for their force on
- |2
                      empiricist assumptions and they most certainly do not depend on the
- |2
                      development of science.The most rigorous contemporary work in the philos-
- |2
                          ophy of religion has not always supported the detailed arguments
- |2
                      of Hume and Kant but it has for the most part supported their overall
- |2
                      conclusions on this issue. Alvin Plantinga, for example, in his God and Other Minds (1967) rejects rather thoroughly
- |2
                      the principles and assumptions of both existence-monism and metho- dological-monism and he
- |2
                      subjects the particulars of Hume's and Kant's views to careful criticism,
- |2
                      yet in the very course of giving a defense of what he takes to be the
- |2
                      rationality of Christian belief, he argues that none of the attempts at a
- |2
                      demonstration of the exist-In the twentieth century a distinct element comes to the fore which counts
- |2
                      in favor of agnosticism but also gives it a particular twist. This new turn
- |2
                      leads to a reformulation of agnosticism. It states agnosticism in such
- |2
                      a manner that it becomes evident how it is a relevant response to one of
- |2
                      the major elements in contemporary philosophical perplexities over
- |2
                      religion.We have hitherto been talking as if God-talk is used in certain central
- |2
                      contexts to make statements of whose truth-value we are in doubt. That is,
- |2
                      there is no doubt that they have a truth-value but there is a doubt
- |2
                      which truth-value they actually have. Theists think that at least some
- |2
                      of the key Jewish or Christian claims are true, atheists think they are
- |2
                      false, and traditional agnos- tics, as H. H.
- |2
                      Price puts it in his Belief (London, 1969), suspend
- |2
                      “judgement on the ground that we do not have sufficient evidence
- |2
                      to decide the question and so far as he [the agnostic] can tell there is no
- |2
                      likelihood that we ever shall have” (p. 455). But in the
- |2
                      twentieth century with certain analytic philosophers the question has
- |2
                      come to the fore about whether these key religious utterances have any
- |2
                      truth-value at all.A. J. Ayer defending the modern variety of em-
- |2
                          piricism called “logical empiricism” argued in hisLanguage, Truth and Logic (London, 1935) that such
- |2
                      key religious utterances are devoid of cognitive mean-
- |2
                          ing. Such considerations lead Ayer to deny that he or anyone
- |2
                      taking such a position could be either a theist, an atheist, or even an
- |2
                      agnostic. In a well known passage Ayer comments that it is very important
- |2
                      not to confuse his view with agnosticism or atheism, for, as he puts
- |2
                      it,It is a characteristic of an agnostic to hold that the existence of
- |2
                              a god is a possibility in which there is no good reason either to
- |2
                              believe or disbelieve; and it is characteristic of an atheist to
- |2
                              hold that it is at least probable that no god exists. And our view
- |2
                              that all utterances about the nature of God are nonsensical, so far
- |2
                              from being identical with, or even lending any support to, either
- |2
                              of these familiar contentions, is actually incompatible with them.
- |2
                              For if the assertion that there is a god is nonsensical, then the
- |2
                              atheist's assertion that there is no god is equally nonsensical,
- |2
                              since it is only a significant proposition that can be significantly
- |2
                               contradicted. As for the agnostic, although he refrains
- |2
                              from saying either that there is or that there is not a god,
- |2
                              he does not deny that the question whether a transcendent god
- |2
                              exists is a genuine question. He does not deny that the two
- |2
                              sentences “There is a transcendent god” and
- |2
                              “There is no transcendent god” express
- |2
                              propositions one of which is actually true and the other false. All
- |2
                              he says is that we have no means of telling which of them is true,
- |2
                              and therefore ought not to commit ourselves to either. But we have
- |2
                              seen that the sentences in question do not express
- |2
                              propositions at all. And this means that agnosticism also is ruled
- |2
                              out
- |2
                          (p. 219).
- |2
                      Ayer goes on to remark that the theist's putative claims are neither valid
- |2
                      nor invalid; they say nothing at all and thus the theist cannot rightly be
- |2
                      “accused of saying anything false, or anything for which he has
- |2
                      insufficient grounds” (ibid., p. 219). It is only when the
- |2
                      Christian, so to speak, turns meta-theologian and claims that in
- |2
                      asserting the existence of a Transcendent God he is expressing a genuine
- |2
                      proposition “that we are entitled to disagree with
- |2
                      him” (ibid.).The central point Ayer is making is that such reli-
- |2
                          gious utterances do not assert anything and thus they can be
- |2
                      neither doubted, believed, nor even asserted to be false. With such
- |2
                      considerations pushed to the front, the key question becomes whether such
- |2
                      religious utterances have any informative content at all.There is something very strange here. Ayer, as we have seen, does not regard
- |2
                      his position as atheistical or agnostic, for since such key religious
- |2
                      utterances could not even be false, they could not be intelligibly
- |2
                      denied and since they make no claim to be intelligibly questioned, they
- |2
                      could not be sensibly doubted. But, as Susan Stebbing rightly observed,
- |2
                      “the plain man would not find it easy to see the difference
- |2
                      between Mr. Ayer's non-atheism and the fool's atheism” (Steb- bing, p. 264). But before we say
- |2
                      “so much the worse for the plain man,” we should
- |2
                      remember that to believe that such key religious utterances are
- |2
                      unbelievable because nonsensical is even a more basic rejection of
- |2
                      religious belief than simply asserting the falsity of the putative
- |2
                      truth-claims of Christianity, but allowing for the possibility that they might be true.Because of this altered conceptualization of the situ-
- |2
                          ation, Price, Edwards, and Nielsen have characterized both
- |2
                      agnosticism and atheism in a broader and more adequate way which takes into
- |2
                      account these problems about meaning. A contemporary agnostic who is
- |2
                      alert to such questions about meaning would maintain that judgments
- |2
                      concerning putatively assertive God-talk should be suspended for either of
- |2
                      two reasons, depend- ing on the exact nature
- |2
                      of the God-talk in question: (1) the claims, though genuine truth-claims,
- |2
                      are without sufficient evidence to warrant either their belief orThe contemporary agnostic sensitive to problems about the logical status of
- |2
                      religious utterances simply stresses that the reasonable and on the whole
- |2
                      justified course of action here is simply to suspend judgment. His
- |2
                      doubts are primarily doubts about the possibility of
- |2
                          there being anything to doubt, but, second-order as they are, they
- |2
                      have an effect similar to the effect of classical agnosticism and they lead
- |2
                      to a similar attitude toward religion. There is neither the classical
- |2
                      atheistic denial that there is anything to the claims of religion nor
- |2
                      is there the fideistic avowal that in spite of all their obscurity and seeming unintelligibility that there still is
- |2
                      something there worthy of belief. Instead there is a
- |2
                      genuine suspension of judgment.The thing to ask is whether the doubts leading to a suspension of judgment
- |2
                      are actually sufficient tojustify such a suspension or, everything considered,
- |2
                      (1) would a leap of faith be more justified or (2) would the
- |2
                      overcoming of doubt in the direction of atheism be more reasonable? Or is
- |2
                      it the case that there is no way of making a rational decision here or of
- |2
                      reasonably deciding what one ought to do or believe?It may indeed be true, as many a sophisticated theo-
- |2
                          logian has argued, that religious commitment is per- fectly compatible with a high degree of ignorance
- |2
                      about God and the nature—whatever that may mean—of
- |2
                      “ultimate reality.” But, if this is the case and if
- |2
                      our ignorance here is as invincible as much contem- porary philosophical argumentation would have us
- |2
                      believe, natural theology seems at least to be thor- oughly undermined. In trying to establish
- |2
                      whether the
- |2
                       world is contingent or non-contingent, whether there is or can
- |2
                      be something “beyond the world” upon which the world
- |2
                      in some sense depends, or whether there is or could be an unlimited reality
- |2
                      which is still in some sense personal, theological reasonings have been
- |2
                          no- toriously unsuccessful. About the
- |2
                      best that has been done is to establish that it is not entirely evident
- |2
                      that these questions are meaningless or utterly unan- swerable.Here a Barthian turn away from natural theology is equally fruitless. To say
- |2
                      that man can by his own endeavors know nothing of God but simply must
- |2
                      await an unpredictable and rationally inexplicable self- disclosure of God—the
- |2
                      core notion of God revealing himself to man—is of no help, for
- |2
                      when we look at religions in an honest anthropological light, we will
- |2
                      see, when all the world is our stage, that we have multitudes of
- |2
                      conflicting alleged revelations with no means at all of deciding, without
- |2
                      the aid of natural theology or philosophical analysis, which, if any,
- |2
                      of these putative revelations are genuine revelations. It is true
- |2
                      enough that if something is actually a divine revelation, it cannot be
- |2
                      assessed by man, but must simply be accepted. But the agnostic reminds the
- |2
                          reve- lationist that we have a
- |2
                      multitude of conflicting candi- date
- |2
                      revelations with no means of reasonably deciding which one to accept. In
- |2
                      such a context a reasonable man will remain agnostic concerning such
- |2
                      matters. To simply accept the authorative claims of a Church in such a
- |2
                      circumstance is to fly in the face of reason.The most crucial problem raised by the so-called truth-claims of Judaism and
- |2
                      Christianity is that of conceivability—to borrow a term that
- |2
                      Herbert Spencer used in the nineteenth century and thereby suggesting
- |2
                      that there are more lines of continuity between the old agnosticism and the
- |2
                      new than this essay has indi- cated. The incredibility—to use Spencer's
- |2
                      contrasting term—of these central religious claims is tied, at
- |2
                      least in part, to their inconceivability.
- |2
                      “God” is not supposed to refer to a being among
- |2
                      beings; by definition God is no finite object or process in the world. But
- |2
                      then how is the referring to be done? What are we really talking about
- |2
                      when we speak of God? How do we or can we fix the reference range of
- |2
                      “God”? God surely cannot be identified in the same
- |2
                      manner we identify the sole realities compatible with
- |2
                      existence-monism. There can be no picking God out as we would a dis- crete entity in space-time. Alternatively
- |2
                      there are theo- logians who will say that
- |2
                      when we come to recognize that it is just a brute fact that there is that
- |2
                      indefinitely immense collection of finite and contingent masses or
- |2
                      conglomerations of things, we use the phrase “the
- |2
                      world” to refer to, and when we recognize it could have been the
- |2
                      case—eternally the case—that there wasIs there anything that would account for the exist-
- |2
                          ence of all finite reality and not itself be a reality that
- |2
                      needed to be similarly explained? In speaking of God we are speaking of
- |2
                      such a reality, if indeed there is such a reality. We are concerned with a
- |2
                      reality not simply—as the world might be—infinite in
- |2
                      space and time, but a reality such that it would not make sense to ask
- |2
                          why it exists. Such a reality could not be a
- |2
                      physical reality.In sum, we have, if we reflect at all, a developing sense of the contingency
- |2
                      of the world. The word “God” in part means, in Jewish
- |2
                      and Christian discourses, whatever it is that is non-contingent upon which
- |2
                      all these contingent realities continuously depend. God is the
- |2
                      completeness that would fill in the essential incom- pleteness of the world. We have feelings of de- pendency, creatureliness, finitude and in
- |2
                      having those feelings, it is argued, we have some sense of that which
- |2
                      is without limit. “God” refers to such alleged
- |2
                      ultimate realities and to something richer as well. But surely this,
- |2
                      the critic of agnosticism will reply, sufficiently fixes the reference
- |2
                      range of “God,” such that it would be a mistake to
- |2
                      assert that “God” is a term supposedly used to refer
- |2
                      to a referent but nothing coherently specifiable counts as a possible
- |2
                      referent for “God,” where “God”
- |2
                      has a non-anthropomorphic employment.Surely such a referent is not something which can be clearly conceived, but,
- |2
                      as we have seen, a non- mysterious God
- |2
                      would not be the God of Judeo-
- |2
                      Christianity. But has language gone on a holiday? We certainly,
- "                    given our religious conditioning, have a \n"
- |2
                          feel- ing
- |2
                       that we understand what we are saying here. But do we? Perhaps, as
- |2
                      Axel Hägerström thought, “contin- gent thing,” “finite
- |2
                      thing,” and “finite reality” are
- |2
                      pleonastic. For anything at all that exists, we seem to be able to ask,
- |2
                      without being linguistically or con-
- |2
                      ceptually deviant, why it exists. “The world” or
- |2
                      “the cosmos” does not stand for an entity or a class of things, but is an umbrella term for all
- |2
                      those things and their structural relations that religious people call
- |2
                      “finite things” and many others just call
- |2
                      “things.” What are we talking about when we say there
- |2
                      is something infinite and utterly different from these “finite
- |2
                      realities” and that this “utterly other
- |2
                      reality” is neither physical nor temporal nor purely conceptual
- |2
                      nor simply imagi- nary, but, while being
- |2
                      unique and radically distinct from all these things, continuously sustains
- |2
                      all these “finite things” and is a mysterious
- |2
                      something upon which they are utterly dependent? Surely this is very
- |2
                      odd talk and “sustains” and
- |2
                      “dependent” have no un-
- |2
                          problematical use in this context.These difficulties and a host of difficulties like them
- |2
                       make it doubtful whether the discourse used to spell out the
- |2
                      reference range of “God” is sufficiently intelli- gible to make such God-talk
- |2
                      coherent. An agnostic of the contemporary sort is a man who suspends judg- ment, oscillating between rejecting
- |2
                      God-talk as an irrational form of discourse containing at crucial junc- tures incoherent or rationally
- |2
                      unjustifiable putative truth-claims and accepting this discourse as
- |2
                      something which, obscure as it is, makes a sufficiently intelligible
- |2
                      and humanly important reference to be worthy of belief.One reading of the situation is that the network of fundamental concepts
- |2
                      constitutive of nonanthropo- morphic
- |2
                      God-talk in Judeo-Christianity is so problem-
- |2
                          atical that the most reasonable thing to do is to opt for
- |2
                      atheism, particularly when we realize that we do not need these religions
- |2
                      or any religion to make sense of our lives or to buttress morality. But
- |2
                      agnosticism, particularly of the contemporary kind specified here,
- |2
                      need not be an evasion and perhaps is the most reason- able alternative for the individual who wishes, concern- ing an appraisal of competing world
- |2
                      views and ways of life, to operate on a principle of maximum caution.Two extensive discussions are in Robert Flint, Agnosticism (London, 1903); and in R. A. Armstrong, Agnosticism and Theism in the Nineteenth Century

  \               AGNOSTICISM\n                \n                    \n                        I\n
  \                   \n                \n                Agnosticism is a philosophical
  and theological\n                    concept which has been understood in various
  ways by different\n                    philosophers and theologians. T. H. Huxley
  coined the term in 1869, and its\n                    first home was in the disputes
  about science and religion, naturalism and\n                        super- naturalism,
  that reached a\n                    climax during the nineteenth century. To be
  an agnostic is to hold that\n                    nothing can be known or at least
  that it is very unlikely that any- thing will be known or soundly believed\n                    concerning
  whether God or any transcendent reality or state exists.\n                It is
  very natural for certain people conditioned in certain ways to believe\n                    that
  there must be some power “behind,”\n                    “beyond,” or “underlying”
  the\n                    universe which is responsible for its order and all the
  incredible\n                    features that are observed and studied by the sciences
  even though these\n                    same people will readily grant that we do
  not know that there is such a\n                    power or have good grounds for
  believing that there is such a power.\n                    While the admission of
  ignorance concerning things divine is usually made\n                    by someone
  outside the circle of faith, it can and indeed has been made by\n                    fideistic
  Jews and Christians as well.\n                Some writers, e.g., Robert Flint and
  James Ward, so construed\n                    “agnosticism” that (1) it was identified
  with\n                    “philosophical skepticism” and (2) it allowed for\n                    there
  being “theistic agnostics” and “Christian\n                        agnos- tics.”
  However, the more\n                    typical employment of “ag-\n                    nosticism”
  is such that it would not be correct to count\n                    as agnostics
  either fideistic believers or Jews and Chris- tians who claim that we can only gain
  knowledge of\n                    God through some mystical awareness or “ineffable\n
  \                   knowledge.” It surely was this standard but more cir- cumscribed
  sense of\n                    “agnosticism” that William James\n                     had
  in mind when he made his famous remark in his essay\n                    “The Will
  to Believe” that agnosticism was the worst\n                    thing that “ever
  came out of the philosopher's\n                    workshop.” Without implying or
  suggesting any sup- port at all for James's value judgment, we shall\n                    construe
  agnosticism in this rather more typical manner. Given this\n                    construal
  (1) “theistic agnosticism” is a contra- diction and thus one cannot be a Jew\n                    or
  a Christian and be an agnostic and (2) also agnosticism is neutral vis-à-vis the
  claim that there can\n                    be no philosophical knowledge or even
  scientific or common-sense knowl- edge. We shall then take agnosticism to\n                    be
  the more limited claim that we either do not or cannot know that\n                    God
  or any other transcendent reality or state exists and thus we should\n                    suspend
  judgment concerning the assertion that God exists. That is to say,\n                    the
  agnostic neither affirms nor denies it. This, as should be evident\n                    from
  the above characterization, can take further specification and indeed\n                    later
  such specifications will be supplied. But such a construal captures\n                    in
  its char- acterization both what was\n                    essentially at issue in
  the great agnostic debates in the nineteenth\n                    century and the
  issue as it has come down to us.\n                II\n                  \n                T.
  H. Huxley was by training a biologist, but he had strong philosophical\n                    interests
  and as a champion of Darwinism he became a major intellectual\n                    figure
  in the nineteenth century. In his “Science and\n                    Christian Tradition”
  (in Collected\n                    Essays), Huxley remarks that agnosticism is a
  method, a stance taken\n                    toward putative religious truth-claims,
  the core of which is to refuse\n                    to assent to religious doctrines
  for which there is no adequate evidence,\n                    but to retain an open-mindedness
  about the possibility of sometime\n                    attaining adequate evidence.
  We ought never to assert that we know a\n                    proposition to be true
  or indeed even to assent to that proposition unless\n                    we have
  adequate evidence to sup- port it.\n                After his youthful reading of
  the Scottish meta-\n                        physician William Hamilton's Philosophy
  of the\n                            Un- conditioned (1829),\n                    Huxley
  repeatedly returned to questions about the limits of our possible\n                    knowledge
  and came, as did Leslie Stephen, to the empiricist\n                    conclusion
  that we cannot know anything about God or any alleged states or\n                    realities
  “beyond phenomena.” Whether there is a God,\n                    a world of demons,
  an immor- tal soul, whether\n                    indeed “the spiritual world” is
  other than human\n                    fantasy or projection, were all taken by Huxley
  to be factual questions open to careful and systematic empirical\n                    investigation.
  In short, however humanly important such questions were,\n                    they
  were also “matters of the intellect” and in such\n                    contexts the018\n
  \                    central maxim of the method of agnosticism is to “fol- low
  your reason as far as it will take you,\n                    without regard to any
  other consideration. And negatively: In matters\n                    of the intellect
  do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not\n                    demonstrated
  or demon- strable”\n                    (Huxley, pp. 245-46). Operating in accordance
  with such a method does not\n                    justify “the denial of the existence
  of any Supernature; but\n                    simply the denial of the validity of
  the evidence adduced in favour of\n                    this, or that, extant form
  of Supernaturalism” (p. 126). Huxley\n                    found that he could no
  more endorse materi-\n                    alism, idealism, atheism, or pantheism
  than he could theism; they\n                    all claimed too much about essentially
  contested matters. Huxley felt that\n                    people espousing such world
  views were too ready to claim a solution\n                    to the “problem of
  existence,” while he remained\n                    painfully aware that he had not
  succeeded in coming by such a solution and\n                    in addition retained
  “a pretty strong conviction that the\n                    problem was insoluble”
  (pp. 237-38).\n                This conviction is at the heart of his agnosticism.
  Huxley was convinced\n                    that Kant and Hamilton had established
  that reason fails us—and\n                    indeed must fail us—when we try to\n
  \                   establish that the world is finite in space or time or indefinite
  in space\n                    or time, rational or irrational, an ordered whole
  or simply\n                    manifesting certain ordered features but not something
  properly to be\n                    called an ordered whole. Answers to such ques-\n
  \                   tions reveal something about our attitudes but can never provide
  us\n                    with propositions we can justifiably claim to be true or
  even know to be\n                    false. Agnosticism is a confession of honesty
  here. It is “the\n                    only position for people who object to say
  that they know what they\n                    are quite aware they do not know”
  (p. 210).\n                Such skepticism concerning the truth-claims of reli-\n
  \                       gion and metaphysics, including, of course, meta- physical
  religiosity, should not be taken as a denial\n                    that there can
  be reliable knowledge. Rather Huxley argued, as John\n                    Dewey
  did far more systematically later, that we can and do gain\n                    experimental
  and ex- periential knowledge\n                    of nature, including human na-
  ture, and that\n                    this, by contrast with so-called “super- natural
  knowledge,” becomes increasingly more\n                        exten- sive and reliable.
  And while\n                    remaining an agnostic, Huxley saw in science—basically
  the\n                    scientific way of fixing belief—a fundamental and well
  grounded\n                        chal- lenge to the authority of the theory\n                    of
  the “spiritual world.”\n                Whatever may have been the case in the seventeenth
  century, there was in\n                    Huxley's time a state of war between
  science and religion. Huxley took\n                    science to be a challenge
  to claims of biblical infallibility and\n                    revelation. The whole
  supernatural world view built on the authority of the\n                    Bible
  and revelation must come\n                     under scientific scrutiny and when
  this is done it be- comes gradually apparent that the use of the\n                    scientific
  method and appeals to scientific canons of criticism give\n                    us
  a far more reliable method of settling belief than do the scriptures and\n                    revelation.\n
  \               To commit ourselves to the Bible as an infallible authority is to
  commit\n                    ourselves to a world view in which we must believe that
  devils were cast\n                    out of a man and went into a herd of swine,
  that the deluge was\n                    universal, that the world was made in six
  days, and the like. Yet such\n                    claims are plainly and massively
  contravened by our actual empirical\n                    knowledge such that they
  are quite beyond the boundaries of respon- sible belief. About such matters,\n                    Huxley
  argues, we ought not to be at all agnostic. Moreover, we cannot\n                    take
  them simply as myths, important for the biblical and Christian\n                    understanding
  of the world, if we are to take seriously biblical\n                    infallibility
  and the authority of revelation. For the Jewish-Christian\n                    world
  view to establish its validity, it must provide us with adequate\n                    grounds
  for believing that there are demons. But there is no good evidence\n                    for
  such alleged realities and to believe in them is the grossest form of\n                    superstition
  (Huxley, p. 215).\n                Even if we fall back on a severe Christology,
  we are still in difficulties,\n                    for it is evident enough that
  Jesus believed in demons and if we are to\n                    adopt a radical Christology
  and take Jesus as our infallible guide to\n                    the divine, we are
  going to have to accept such super- stitious beliefs. Such beliefs affront not only
  our\n                        intel- lect—our credibility\n                    concerning
  what it is reasonable to believe—they also affront\n                    our moral
  sense as well (p. 226). Yet once we give up the Gospel claim\n                    that
  there are “demons who can be transferred from a man to\n                    a pig,”
  the other stories of “demonic possession fall\n                    under suspicion.”
  Once we start on this slide, once we challenge\n                    the ultimate
  authority of the Bible, and follow experimental and scientific\n                    procedures,
  the ground for the whole Judeo-Christian world view is\n                    undermined.\n
  \               Huxley obviously thinks its credibility and proba-\n                        bility
  is of a very low order; an order which would make\n                    Christian
  or Jewish belief quite impossible for a reasonable and tolerably\n                    well
  informed man. Those who claim to know that there are such unseen\n                    and
  indeed utterly unseeable realities, are very likely peo- ple who have taken “cunning
  phrases for\n                    answers,” where real answers are “not merely actually\n
  \                       impossi- ble, but theoretically\n                    inconceivable.”
  Yet as an agnostic one must\n                    always—even for such problematical
  trans- cendental claims—remain open to conviction\n                    where evidence
  can be brought to establish the truth of such\n                    transcendent
  religious claims.\n                Leslie Stephen in his neglected An Agnostic's019\n
  \                        Apology (1893) remarks that he uses\n                    “agnostic”
  in a sense close to that of T. H. Huxley.\n                    To be an agnostic,
  according to Stephen, is to reject what he calls\n                        “Dog-
  matic Atheism,”\n                    i.e., “the doctrine that there is no God, whatever
  is meant by\n                    God...”; it is, instead, (1) to affirm “what no
  one\n                    denies,” namely “that there are limits to the sphere\n
  \                   of human intelligence” and (2) also to affirm the controversial\n
  \                   empiricist thesis “that those limits are such as to exclude
  at\n                    least what Lewes called 'Metempirical knowledge'” (p. 1).\n
  \                   (“Metempirical knowledge” is meant to designate all\n                    forms
  of knowl- edge of a transcendent,\n                    numinal, nonempirical sort.)\n
  \               Stephen makes apparent the empiricist commit-\n                    ments
  of his conception of agnosticism in charac- terizing gnosticism, the view agnosticism
  is\n                    deliberately set against. To be a gnostic is to believe
  that “we\n                    can attain truths not capable of verification and
  not needing\n                    verification by actual experiment or observation”
  (ibid., pp.\n                    1-2). In gaining such a knowledge gnostics in opposition
  to both Hume and\n                    Kant claim that by the use of our reason we
  can attain a knowledge\n                    that transcends “the narrow limits of
  experience” (p.\n                    1). But the agnostic, firmly in the empiricist
  tradition, denies that\n                    there can be any knowledge of the world,
  includ-\n                    ing anything about its origin and destiny, which tran-
  scends experience and comprehends “the sorry\n                    scheme of things
  entire.” Such putative knowledge, Stephen\n                    maintains, is illusory
  and not something “essential to the\n                    highest interests of mankind,”
  providing us, as speculative\n                    metaphysicians believe, with the
  solution to “the dark riddle of\n                    the universe” (p. 2).\n                In
  a manner that anticipates the challenge to the claims of religion and\n                    metaphysics
  made by the logical empiricists, Stephen says that in addition\n                    to
  the prob- lem of whether they can establish\n                    the truth or probable
  truth of “religious\n                    truth-claims” there is the further\n                    consideration—actually
  a logically prior question—of\n                    whether such putative claims
  “have any meaning” (p.\n                    3).\n                It should be noted
  that Stephen does not begin “An Agnostic's\n                    Apology” by discussing
  semantical diffi- culties in putative religious truth-claims but starts\n                    with
  problems connected with what W. K. Clifford was later to call\n                    “the
  ethics of belief.” We indeed would all\n                    want—if we could do
  it honestly—to accept the claim\n                    that “evil is transitory...
  good eternal” and that\n                    the “world is really an embodiment of
  love and wisdom,\n                    however dark it may appear to us” (p. 2).
  But the rub is that\n                    many of us cannot believe that and in a
  question of such inestimable human\n                    value, we have “the most
  sacred obligations to recognize the\n                    facts” and make our judgments
  in accordance with the facts. But\n                    the facts do not give us
  grounds for confidence in the viability of\n                    Judeo-Christian
  beliefs. Rather we are\n                     strongly inclined when we inspect these
  beliefs to believe they\n                    are wish fulfillments. And while it
  may indeed be true that for the moment\n                    dreams may be pleasanter
  than realities, it is also true that if we\n                    are bent on attaining
  a more permanent measure of happi- ness, it “must be won by adapting our lives\n
  \                   to the realities,” for we know from experience that\n                    illusory
  consolations “are the bitterest of\n                    mockeries” (ibid.). The
  religious platitudes “Pain is\n                    not an evil,” “Death is not a
  separation,”\n                    and “Sickness is but a blessing in disguise” have\n
  \                   tortured sufferers far more than “the gloomiest speculations
  of\n                    avowed pessimists” (ibid.).\n                However, the
  problem of meaning cuts to a deeper\n                    conceptual level than do
  such arguments about the ethics of belief. Where\n                    Judeo-Christianity
  does not have a fideistic basis, it is committed to what\n                    Stephen
  calls gnosticism. But does not such a doctrine fail\n                    “to recognize
  the limits of possible knowledge” and\n                    in trying to transcend
  these limits does it not in effect commit the\n                    gnostic to pseudo-propositions
  which are devoid of literal meaning? Logical\n                    empiricists later
  answered this question in the affirmative and while\n                    it is not
  crystal clear that Stephen's answer is quite that definite,\n                    it
  would appear that this is what he wants to maintain. And if that is what\n                    Stephen
  is maintaining, there can, of course, be no knowledge of the\n                    divine.\n
  \               Stephen raises this key question concerning the intelligibility
  of such\n                    gnostic God-talk, but he does little with it. Instead
  he focuses on some\n                    key questions concerning attempts by theologians
  to undermine\n                    agnosticism. He first points out that an appeal
  to rev- elation is no answer to the agnostic's denial that we\n                    have
  knowledge of transcendent realities or states, for in claiming to rely\n                    exclusively
  on revelation these theologians acknowledge that\n                    “natural man
  can know nothing of the Divine nature.”\n                    But this Stephen replies,
  is not only to grant but in effect to assert the\n                    agnostic's
  fundamental principle (p. 5). He points out that H. L.\n                    Mansel
  in effect and in substance affirms agnosticism and that Cardinal\n                    Newman
  with his appeal to the testimony of conscience does not provide a\n                    reliable
  argument on which to base a belief in God nor does he\n                    undermine
  the agnostic's position, for “the voice of conscience\n                    has been
  very differently interpreted.” Some of these\n                    interpretations,
  secular though they be, have all the appearances of being\n                    at
  least as valid as Newman's, for all that Newman or anyone else has\n                    shown.
  Moreover, on any reasonable reading of a prin-\n                        ciple of
  parsimony, they are far simpler than Newman's\n                    interpretation.
  Thus Newman's arguments in reality prove, as do Mansel's,\n                    that
  a man ought to be an agnostic concerning such ultimate questions\n                    where
  reason remains his guide and where he does not make an appeal to\n                    the
  authority of the Church. They, of020\n                     course, would have us
  accept the authority of the Church, but\n                    how can we reasonably
  do so when there are so many Churches, so many\n                    conflicting
  authorities, and so many putative revelations? Where reason\n                    can
  only lead us to agnosticism concerning religious mat- ters, we can have no ground
  for accepting one Church,\n                    one religious authority, or one putative
  revelation rather than another. We\n                    simply have no way of know-
  ing which course is\n                    the better course. Agnosticism, Stephen
  concludes, is the only reasonable\n                    and viable alternative.\n
  \               Like Huxley, and like Hume before him, Stephen is skeptical of the
  a priori arguments of metaphysics and natural\n                    theology. “There
  is not a single proof of natural\n                    theology,” he asserts, “of
  which the negative has not\n                    been maintained as vigorously as
  the affirmative” (p. 9). In\n                    such a context, where there is
  no substantial agreement, but just endless\n                    and irre- solvable
  philosophical\n                    controversy, it is the duty of a reasonable man
  to profess ignorance (p.\n                    9). In trying to escape the bounds
  of sense—in trying to gain\n                    some metempirical knowledge—philosophers
  continue to\n                    contradict flatly the first principles of their
  prede- cessors and no vantage point is attained where we\n                    can
  objectively assess these endemic metaphysical conflicts that\n                    divide
  philosophers. To escape utter skepticism, we must be agnostics and\n                    argue
  that such metaphysical and theological controversies lead to\n                    “transcending
  the limits of reason” (p. 10). But the\n                    only widely accepted
  characterization of these limits “comes in\n                    substance to an
  exclusion of ontology” and an adherence to\n                    empirically based
  truth-claims as the only legitimate truth-claims.\n                It will not help,
  Stephen argues, to maintain that the Numinous, i.e., the\n                    divine,
  is essentially mysterious and that religious\n                    understanding—a
  seeing through a glass darkly—is a\n                    knowledge of something which
  is irreducibly and inescapably mysterious. In\n                    such talk in
  such contexts, there is linguistic legerdemain: we call\n                    our
  doubts mysteries and what is now being ap-\n                    pealed to as “the
  mystery of faith” is but the\n                        theolog- ical phrase for agnosticism
  (p.\n                    22).\n                Stephen argues that one could believe
  knowledge of the standard types was\n                    quite possible and indeed
  actual and remain skeptical about metaphysics. It\n                    is just such
  a position that many (perhaps most) contem- porary philosophers would take. In taking
  this\n                    position himself, Stephen came to believe that metaphysical
  claims are\n                    “nothing but the bare husks of meaningless words.”
  To\n                    gain genuine knowledge, we must firmly put aside such meaningless\n
  \                   metaphysical claims and recognize the more limited extent of
  our\n                    knowledge claims. A firm recognition here will enable us
  to avoid\n                    utter skepticism because we come to see that within\n
  \                    the limits of the experiential “we have been able to\n                    discover
  certain reliable truths” and with them “we\n                    shall find sufficient
  guidance for the needs of life” (p. 26).\n                    So while we remain
  religious skeptics and skeptical of the claims of\n                    transcendental
  metaphysics, we are not generally skeptical about man's\n                    capacity
  to attain reliable knowledge. Yet it remains the case that\n                    nothing
  is known or can be known, of the alleged “ultimate\n                    reality”—the
  Infinite and Absolute—of tra- ditional metaphysics and natural theology\n                    (p.
  26). And thus nothing can be known of God.\n                \n                    III\n
  \               \n                Before moving on to a consideration of some twen-
  tieth-century formulations of agnosticism and to a\n                    critical
  examination of all forms of agnosticism, let us consider briefly a\n                    question
  that the above charac-\n                    terization of Huxley and Stephen certainly
  should give rise to.\n                    Given the correctness of the above criticisms
  of Judaism and Christianity,\n                    do we not have good grounds for
  rejecting these religions and is not this\n                    in effect an espousal
  of atheism rather than agnosticism?\n                We should answer differently
  for Huxley than we do for Stephen. Huxley's\n                    arguments, if correct,
  would give us good grounds for rejecting\n                    Christianity and Judaism;
  but they are not sufficient by themselves\n                    for jettisoning a
  belief in God, though they would require us to\n                    suspend judgment
  about the putative knowledge-\n                        claim that God exists and
  created the world. But it must be\n                    remembered that agnosticism
  is the general claim that we do not know and\n                    (more typically)
  cannot know or have good grounds for believing that there\n                    is
  a God. But to accept this is not to accept the claim that there is\n                    no
  God, unless we accept the premiss that what cannot even in principle be\n                    known
  cannot exist. This was not a premiss to which Huxley and Stephen\n                    were
  committed. Rather they accepted the standard agnostic view that\n                    since
  we cannot know or have good reasons for believing that God exists we\n                    should
  suspend judg- ment concerning his\n                    existence or nonexistence.
  More- over, as we\n                    shall see, forms of Jewish and Christian
  fideism when linked with modern\n                    biblical scholarship could
  accept at least most of Huxley's arguments\n                    and still defend
  an acceptance of the Jewish or Christian faith.\n                Stephen's key arguments
  are more epistemologically oriented and are more\n                    definitely
  committed to an empiricist account of meaning and the limits of\n                        con-
  ceivability. As we shall see in\n                    examining the conten- tions
  of some\n                    contemporary critics of religion, it is more difficult
  to see what, given\n                    the correctness of Stephen's own account,
  it could mean to affirm, deny, or even doubt the existence of God. The very\n                    concept
  of God on such an account becomes problematical. And021\n                     this
  makes what it would be to be an agnostic, an atheist, or a\n                    theist
  problematical.\n                The cultural context in which we speak of religion
  is very different in the\n                    twentieth century than it was in the
  nineteenth (cf. MacIntyre, Ricoeur).\n                    For most twentieth-century
  people with even a minimal amount of\n                    education, the authority
  of science has cut much deeper than it did in\n                    previous centuries.
  The cosmo- logical\n                    claims in the biblical stories are no longer
  taken at face value by the\n                    overwhelming majority of edu- cated
  people both\n                    religious and non-religious. Theolo- gians\n                    working
  from within the circle of faith have carried out an extensive\n                    program
  of de-mythologizing such biblical claims. Thus it is evident that\n                    in
  one quite obvious respect the nineteenth-century agnostics have\n                    clearly
  been victorious. There is no longer any serious attempt to defend\n                    the
  truth of the cosmological claims in the type of biblical stories that\n                    Huxley
  discusses.\n                However, what has not received such wide accept-\n                    ance
  is the claim that the acceptance of such a de- mythologizing undermines Judaism
  and\n                    Christianity and drives an honest man in the direction
  of agnos- ticism or atheism. Many would claim\n                    that such de-
  mythologizing only\n                    purifies Judaism and Christianity of extraneous
  cultural material. The\n                    first thing to ask is whether or not
  a steady recognition of the fact\n                    that these biblical stories
  are false supports agnosticism as strongly\n                    as Huxley thinks
  it does.\n                Here the new historical perspective on the Bible is a
  crucial factor. The\n                    very concept of the authority of the Bible
  undergoes a sea change with the\n                    new look in historical scholarship.
  It is and has been widely\n                    acknowledged both now and in the
  nineteenth century that Judaism and\n                    Christianity are both integrally
  linked with certain historical claims.\n                    They are not sufficient
  to establish the truth of either of these\n                    religions, but they
  are necessary. Yet modern historical\n                    research—to put it minimally—places
  many of these\n                    historical claims in an equivocal light and makes
  it quite im- possible to accept claims about the literal\n                    infallibility
  of the Bible. Conservative evangelicalists (funda- mentalists) try to resist this
  tide\n                    and in reality still battle with Huxley. They reject the
  basic findings\n                    of modern biblical scholarship and in contrast
  to mod- ernists treat the Bible not as a fallible and\n                    myth-laden
  account of God's self-revelation in history but as a fully\n                    inspired
  and infallible historical record. Conservative evangelicalists\n                    agree
  with modernists that revelation consists in God's self-disclosure to\n                    man,
  but they further believe that the Bible is an infallible testimony of\n                    God's
  self-unveiling. Modernists by contrast believe that we must\n                    discover
  what the crucial historical but yet divine events and realities\n                    are
  like by a painstaking historical investigation of the biblical\n                    material.
  This involves all\n                     the techniques of modern historical research.
  The vari- ous accounts in the Bible must be sifted by\n                    methodical
  inquiry and independently acquired knowledge of the culture\n                    and
  the times must be used whenever possible.\n                Conservative evangelicalism
  is still strong as a cul-\n                        tural phenomenon in North America,
  though it is steadily losing\n                    strength. However it is not a
  serious influence in the major seminaries and\n                    modernism has
  thoroughly won the day in the intellectually respect- able centers of Jewish and
  Christian\n                    learning. Huxley's arguments do come into conflict
  with conservative\n                    evangelicalism and his arguments about the
  plain fal-\n                        sity, utter incoherence, and sometimes questionable
  morality of\n                    the miracle stories and stories of Jesus' actions
  would have to be met by\n                    such conservative evangelicalists.
  But the modernists would be on\n                    Huxley's side here. So, for
  a large and respectable element of the Jewish\n                    and Christian
  community, Huxley's arguments, which lead him to reject Christi- anity and accept
  agnosticism, are\n                    accepted but not taken as at all undermining
  the foundations of\n                    Judaism or Christianity.\n                Huxley's
  sort of endeavor, like the more systematic endeavors of David\n                    Strauss,
  simply helps Christians rid the world of the historically\n                    contingent
  cultural trap- pings of the\n                    biblical writers. Once this has
  been cut away, modernists argue, the true\n                    import of the biblical
  message can be seen as something of decisive\n                    relevance that
  transcends the vicissitudes of time.\n                However, this is not all that
  should be said vis-à-vis the conflict\n                    between science and religion
  and agnos-\n                    ticism. It is often said that the conflict between
  science and\n                    religion came to a head in the nineteenth century
  and now has been\n                    transcended. Science, it is averred, is now
  seen to be neutral concerning\n                    materialism or any other metaphysical
  thesis and theology—the\n                        en- terprise of attempting to provide\n
  \                   ever deeper, clearer, and more reasonable statements and explications
  of\n                    the truths of religion—is more sophisticated and less vul-
  nerable to attacks by science or\n                    scientifically oriented thinkers.
  Still it may be the case that there\n                    remain some conflicts between
  science and religion which have not been\n                    overcome even with
  a sophisticated analysis of religion, where that\n                    analysis takes
  the religions of the world and Christianity and Judaism in\n                    particular
  to be making truth-claims.\n                Let us consider how such difficulties
  might arise. Most Christians, for\n                    example, would want to claim
  as something central to their religion that\n                    Christ rose from
  the dead and that there is a life after the death of\n                    our earthly
  bodies. These claims seem at least to run athwart our\n                    scientific
  understanding of the world so that it is difficult to know how\n                    we
  could both accept scientific method as the most reliable method of settling022 disputes
  about the facts and accept these central Christian\n                    claims.
  Moreover, given what science teaches us about the world, these\n                    things
  could not happen or have happened. Yet it is also true that the by\n                    now
  widely accepted new historical perspective on the Bible recognizes\n                    and
  indeed stresses mythical and po- etical\n                    strands in the biblical
  stories. And surely it is in this non-literal way\n                    that the
  stories about demons, Jonah in the whale's belly, and Noah and his\n                    ark
  are to be taken, but how far is this to be carried with the other\n                    biblical
  claims? Are we to extend it to such central Christian claims as\n                    “Christ
  rose from the Dead,” “Man shall\n                    survive the death of his earthly
  body,” “God is in\n                    Christ”? If we do, it becomes com-\n                        pletely
  unclear as to what it could mean to speak of either the\n                    truth
  or falsity of the Christian religion. If we do not, then it would\n                    seem
  that some central Chris- tian\n                    truth-claims do clash with scientific
  claims and orientations so that there\n                    is after all a conflict
  between science and religion.\n                Given such a dilemma, the agnostic
  or atheist could then go on to claim that\n                    either these key
  religious utterances do not function propositionally as\n                        truth-
  claims at all or there is indeed\n                    such a clash. But if there
  is such a clash, the scientific claims are\n                    clearly the claims
  to be preferred, for of all the rival ways of\n                    fixing belief,
  the scientific way of fixing belief is clearly the most\n                    reliable.
  Thus if there are good empir- ical,\n                    scientific reasons (as
  there are) for thinking that people who die are not\n                    resurrected,
  that when our earthly bodies die we die, and that there is no\n                    evidence
  at all, and indeed not even any clear meaning to the claim\n                    that
  there are “resurrection bodies” and a\n                        “res- urrection\n
  \                   world” utterly distinct from the cosmos, we have the strongest\n
  \                   of reasons for not accepting the Christian claim that “Christ\n
  \                   rose from the Dead.” The scientific beliefs in conflict with\n
  \                   that belief are ones that it would be foolish to jettison. But
  it is\n                    only by a sacrifice of our scientific way of conceiving
  of things that\n                    we could assent to such a central religious
  claim. Thus it is fair to say\n                    that our scientific under- standing
  drives\n                    us in the direction of either atheism or agnosticism.\n
  \               Some contemporary theologians have responded to such contentions
  by arguing\n                    that there are good con- ceptual reasons why\n                    there
  could not be, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, such a\n                    conflict.
  “Christ” is not equivalent to\n                    “Jesus” but to “the son of God”\n
  \                   and God is not a physical reality. Christianity centers on a
  belief in a\n                    deity who is beyond the world, who is creator of
  the world. But such a\n                    reality is in principle, since it is
  transcendent to the cosmos, not\n                    capable of being investigated
  scientifically but must\n                     be understood in some other way. God
  in his proper\n                    non-anthropomorphic forms is beyond the reach
  of evidence. Only crude\n                    anthropomorphic forms of Christian
  belief could be disproved by modern\n                        scien- tific investigations.\n
  \               To believe that Christ rose from the dead is to be committed to
  a belief in\n                    miracles. But, it has been forcefully argued by
  Ninian Smart, this does not\n                        com- mit us to something which
  is\n                    anti-scientific or that can be ruled out a priori\n                    (Smart
  [1964], Ch. II; [1966], pp. 44-45). A miracle is an event of divine\n                    significance
  which is an exception to at least one law of nature.\n                    Scientific
  laws are not, it is important to remember, falsified by single\n                    exceptions
  but only by a class of experimentally repeatable events. Thus we\n                    can
  believe in the miracle of Christ's resurrection without clashing\n                    with
  anything sanctioned by science. It is a dogma, the critic of\n                    agnosticism
  could continue, to think that everything that can be known can\n                    be
  known by the method of science or by simple observation. A thor- oughly scientific
  mind quite devoid of\n                    credulity could remain committed to Judaism
  or Christianity, believe\n                    in God, and accept such crucial miracle
  stories without abandoning a\n                    scientific attitude, i.e., he
  could accept all the findings of science and\n                    accept its authority
  as the most efficient method for ascertaining what is\n                    the case
  when ascertaining what is the case comes to predicting and\n                    retrodicting
  classes of experimentally repeatable events or processes.\n                Christians
  as well as agnostics can and do recognize the obscurity and\n                    mysteriousness
  of religious claims. The Christian should go on to say that\n                    a
  nonmysterious God, a God whose reality is evident, would not be the\n                    God
  of Judeo-Christianity—the God to be accepted on faith with\n                    fear
  and trembling. It is only for a God who moves in mysterious ways, that\n                    the
  characteristic Jewish and Christian attitudes of discipleship, adora- tion, and
  faith are appropriate. If the\n                    existence of God and what it
  was to act in accordance with His will\n                    were perfectly evident
  or clearly establishable by hard intellectual work,\n                    faith would
  lose its force and ration- ale.\n                    Faith involves risk, trust,
  and commitment. Judaism or Christianity is not\n                    something one
  simply must be- lieve in if one\n                    will only think the matter
  through as clearly and honestly as possible.\n                What is evident is
  that the agnosticism of a Huxley and a Stephen at\n                    least—and
  a Bertrand Russell as well—rests on a\n                    philosophical view not
  dictated by science. James Ward saw this around the\n                    turn of
  the century and argued in his Naturalism and\n                        Agnosticism
  that agnosticism “is an inherently unstable\n                    position” unless
  it is supplemented by some general\n                    philosophical view such
  as materialism or idealism (p. 21). Yet it is023\n                     just such
  overall views that Huxley and Stephen were anxious to\n                    avoid
  and along Humean lines viewed with a thoroughgoing skepticism.\n                In
  sum, the claim is that only if such an overall philosophical view is\n                    justified
  is it the case that there may be good grounds for being an\n                    agnostic
  rather than a Christian or a Jew. The overall position\n                    necessary
  for such a justification is either a position of empiricism\n                    or
  materialism and if it is the former it must be a form of empiricism\n                    which
  in Karl Popper's terms is also a scientism. By this we mean the claim\n                    that
  there are no facts which science cannot explore: that what can- not at least in
  principle be known by the\n                    method of science cannot be known.
  Where alternatively scien- tism is part of a reductive materialist\n                    metaphysics,
  there is a commitment to what has been called an\n                    “existence-monism,”
  namely, the view that there is\n                    only one sort of level or order
  of existence and that is spatiotemporal\n                    existence. That is
  to say, such an existence-monist believes that to exist\n                    is
  to have a place in space-time. In support of this, he may point out\n                    that
  we can always ask about a thing that is supposed to exist where it exists. This,
  it is claimed, indicates how\n                    we in reality operate on materialist
  assumptions. And note that if that\n                    question is not apposite,
  “exists” and its\n                    equivalents are not being employed in their
  standard\n                    senses, but are being used in a secondary sense as
  in “Ghosts\n                    and gremlins exist merely in one's mind.” Besides\n
  \                   existence-monism there is the even more per-\n                    vasive
  and distinctively empiricist position—a position\n                    shared by
  the logical empiricists, by Bertrand Russell, and by John\n                    Dewey—referred
  to as “methodological- monism”: to wit “that all\n                    statements
  of fact are such that they can be investigated scientifically,\n                    i.e.,
  that they can in principle be falsified by\n                    observation” (Smart
  [1966], p. 8).\n                However, critics of agnosticism have responded,
  as has Ninian Smart, by\n                    pointing out that these philo- sophical\n
  \                   positions are vulnerable to a variety of fairly obvious and
  long-standing\n                    criticisms. Perhaps these criticisms can be and
  have been met, but these\n                    positions are highly controversial.
  If agnosticism is tied to them, do\n                    we not have as good grounds
  for being skeptical of agnosticism as the\n                    agnostics have for
  being skeptical of the claims of religion.\n                Some samplings of the
  grounds for being skeptical about the philosophical\n                    underpinnings
  for agnosticism are these. When I suddenly remember that I\n                    left
  my key in my car, it makes sense to speak of the space-time\n                    location
  of my car but, it is at least plausibly argued, not of the\n                    space-time
  location of my sudden thought. Moreover numbers exist but it\n                    hardly
  makes sense to ask where they exist. It is\n                    not the case that
  for all\n                     standard uses of “exist” that to exist is to\n                    have
  a place in space-time. Methodological-monism is also beset with\n                    difficulties.
  There are in science theoretically unobservable entities and\n                    “from
  quite early times, the central concepts of religion, such\n                    as
  God and nirvana already include the notion that what they stand for\n                    cannot
  literally be observed” (Smart [1962], p. 8). Moreover it\n                    is
  not evident that we could falsify state-\n                    ments such as “There
  are some graylings in\n                    Michigan” or “Every human being has some
  neurotic\n                    traits” or “Photons really exist, they are not simply\n
  \                   scientific fictions.” Yet we do recognize them (or so at least\n
  \                   it would seem) as intelligible statements of fact. Such considerations\n
  \                   lead Ninian Smart to claim confidently in his The Teacher\n
  \                       and Christian Belief (London, 1966) that “it remains\n                    merely
  a dogma to claim that all facts are facts about moons and flowers\n                    and
  humans and other denizens of the cosmos. There need be no general\n                    embargo
  upon belief in a transcendent reality, pro-\n                        vided such
  belief is not merely based on uncontrolled\n                    speculation” (p.
  51). Smart goes on to conclude that\n                    “the exclusion of transcendent
  fact rests on a mere\n                    decision” (p. 52). So it would appear,
  from what has been said\n                    above, that agnosticism has no solid
  rational foundation.\n                The dialectic of the argument over agnosticism
  is not nearly at an end and\n                    it shall be the burden of the argument
  here to establish that agnosticism\n                    still has much to be said
  for it. First of all, even granting, for the\n                    reasons outlined
  above, that neither the develop-\n                        ment of science nor an
  appeal to scientism or empiri- cism establishes agnosticism, there are other consid-
  erations which give it strong\n                    support. David Hume'sDialogues
  on Natural Religion (1779) and Immanuel\n                    Kant's Critique of
  Pure Reason (1781) make it quite\n                    evident that none of the proofs
  for the existence of God work, i.e., they\n                    are not sound or
  reliable argu- ments.\n                    Furthermore it should be noted that their
  ar-\n                    guments do not for the most part depend for their force
  on\n                    empiricist assumptions and they most certainly do not depend
  on the\n                    development of science.\n                The most rigorous
  contemporary work in the philos-\n                        ophy of religion has not
  always supported the detailed arguments\n                    of Hume and Kant but
  it has for the most part supported their overall\n                    conclusions
  on this issue. Alvin Plantinga, for example, in his God and Other Minds (1967) rejects
  rather thoroughly\n                    the principles and assumptions of both existence-monism
  and metho- dological-monism and he\n                    subjects the particulars
  of Hume's and Kant's views to careful criticism,\n                    yet in the
  very course of giving a defense of what he takes to be the\n                    rationality
  of Christian belief, he argues that none of the attempts at a\n                    demonstration
  of the exist-024\n                    \n                    ence of God have succeeded.
  He is echoed in this claim by such\n                    important contemporary analytical
  theologians as John Hick and Diogenes\n                    Allen. This lack of validated
  knowledge of the divine or lack of such\n                    warranted belief strengthens
  the hand of the agnostics, though it is\n                    also compatible with
  fideism or a revelationist view such as Barth's, which\n                    holds
  that man on his own can know nothing of God but must rely utterly on\n                    God's
  self-disclosure.\n                \n                    \n                        IV\n
  \                   \n                In the twentieth century a distinct element
  comes to the fore which counts\n                    in favor of agnosticism but
  also gives it a particular twist. This new turn\n                    leads to a
  reformulation of agnosticism. It states agnosticism in such\n                    a
  manner that it becomes evident how it is a relevant response to one of\n                    the
  major elements in contemporary philosophical perplexities over\n                    religion.\n
  \               We have hitherto been talking as if God-talk is used in certain
  central\n                    contexts to make statements of whose truth-value we
  are in doubt. That is,\n                    there is no doubt that they have a truth-value
  but there is a doubt\n                    which truth-value they actually have.
  Theists think that at least some\n                    of the key Jewish or Christian
  claims are true, atheists think they are\n                    false, and traditional
  agnos- tics, as H. H.\n                    Price puts it in his Belief (London,
  1969), suspend\n                    “judgement on the ground that we do not have
  sufficient evidence\n                    to decide the question and so far as he
  [the agnostic] can tell there is no\n                    likelihood that we ever
  shall have” (p. 455). But in the\n                    twentieth century with certain
  analytic philosophers the question has\n                    come to the fore about
  whether these key religious utterances have any\n                    truth-value
  at all.\n                A. J. Ayer defending the modern variety of em-\n                        piricism
  called “logical empiricism” argued in hisLanguage, Truth and Logic (London, 1935)
  that such\n                    key religious utterances are devoid of cognitive
  mean-\n                        ing. Such considerations lead Ayer to deny that he
  or anyone\n                    taking such a position could be either a theist,
  an atheist, or even an\n                    agnostic. In a well known passage Ayer
  comments that it is very important\n                    not to confuse his view
  with agnosticism or atheism, for, as he puts\n                    it,\n                \n
  \                   \n                        It is a characteristic of an agnostic
  to hold that the existence of\n                            a god is a possibility
  in which there is no good reason either to\n                            believe
  or disbelieve; and it is characteristic of an atheist to\n                            hold
  that it is at least probable that no god exists. And our view\n                            that
  all utterances about the nature of God are nonsensical, so far\n                            from
  being identical with, or even lending any support to, either\n                            of
  these familiar contentions, is actually incompatible with them.\n                            For
  if the assertion that there is a god is nonsensical, then the\n                            atheist's
  assertion that there is no god is equally nonsensical,\n                            since
  it is only a significant proposition that can be significantly\n                             contradicted.
  As for the agnostic, although he refrains\n                            from saying
  either that there is or that there is not a god,\n                            he
  does not deny that the question whether a transcendent god\n                            exists
  is a genuine question. He does not deny that the two\n                            sentences
  “There is a transcendent god” and\n                            “There is no transcendent
  god” express\n                            propositions one of which is actually
  true and the other false. All\n                            he says is that we have
  no means of telling which of them is true,\n                            and therefore
  ought not to commit ourselves to either. But we have\n                            seen
  that the sentences in question do not express\n                            propositions
  at all. And this means that agnosticism also is ruled\n                            out\n
  \                   \n                    \n                        (p. 219).\n
  \                   \n                \n                Ayer goes on to remark that
  the theist's putative claims are neither valid\n                    nor invalid;
  they say nothing at all and thus the theist cannot rightly be\n                    “accused
  of saying anything false, or anything for which he has\n                    insufficient
  grounds” (ibid., p. 219). It is only when the\n                    Christian, so
  to speak, turns meta-theologian and claims that in\n                    asserting
  the existence of a Transcendent God he is expressing a genuine\n                    proposition
  “that we are entitled to disagree with\n                    him” (ibid.).\n                The
  central point Ayer is making is that such reli-\n                        gious utterances
  do not assert anything and thus they can be\n                    neither doubted,
  believed, nor even asserted to be false. With such\n                    considerations
  pushed to the front, the key question becomes whether such\n                    religious
  utterances have any informative content at all.\n                There is something
  very strange here. Ayer, as we have seen, does not regard\n                    his
  position as atheistical or agnostic, for since such key religious\n                    utterances
  could not even be false, they could not be intelligibly\n                    denied
  and since they make no claim to be intelligibly questioned, they\n                    could
  not be sensibly doubted. But, as Susan Stebbing rightly observed,\n                    “the
  plain man would not find it easy to see the difference\n                    between
  Mr. Ayer's non-atheism and the fool's atheism” (Steb- bing, p. 264). But before
  we say\n                    “so much the worse for the plain man,” we should\n                    remember
  that to believe that such key religious utterances are\n                    unbelievable
  because nonsensical is even a more basic rejection of\n                    religious
  belief than simply asserting the falsity of the putative\n                    truth-claims
  of Christianity, but allowing for the possibility that they might be true.\n                Because
  of this altered conceptualization of the situ-\n                        ation, Price,
  Edwards, and Nielsen have characterized both\n                    agnosticism and
  atheism in a broader and more adequate way which takes into\n                    account
  these problems about meaning. A contemporary agnostic who is\n                    alert
  to such questions about meaning would maintain that judgments\n                    concerning
  putatively assertive God-talk should be suspended for either of\n                    two
  reasons, depend- ing on the exact nature\n                    of the God-talk in
  question: (1) the claims, though genuine truth-claims,\n                    are
  without sufficient evidence to warrant either their belief or025\n                     categorical
  rejection, or (2) their meaning is so problem- atical that it is doubtful whether\n
  \                   there is something there which is sufficiently intelligible
  or coherent\n                    to be believed. Where God is conceived somewhat
  an- thropomorphically the first\n                    condition obtains and where
  God is conceived non-anthropomorphically\n                    the second condition
  obtains. The contemporary agnostic believes that\n                    “God” in the
  most typical religious employments is so\n                    indeterminate in meaning
  that he must simply suspend judgment about whether\n                    there is
  anything that it stands for which can intelligibly be\n                    believed.
  His position, as Price points out, is like the traditional\n                    agnostic's
  in being neutral between theism and atheism (p. 454). He\n                    believes
  that neither such positive judgment is justified, but unlike a\n                        contem-
  porary atheist, on the one\n                    hand, he is not so confident of
  the unintelligibility or incoherence of\n                    religious ut- terances
  that he feels that\n                    religious belief is irrational and is to
  be rejected, but, on the other\n                    hand, he does not believe one
  is justified in taking these problematic\n                    utterances as being
  obscurely revelatory of Divine Truth. Neither atheism\n                    nor any
  of the several forms of fideism is acceptable to him.\n                The contemporary
  agnostic sensitive to problems about the logical status of\n                    religious
  utterances simply stresses that the reasonable and on the whole\n                    justified
  course of action here is simply to suspend judgment. His\n                    doubts
  are primarily doubts about the possibility of\n                        there being
  anything to doubt, but, second-order as they are, they\n                    have
  an effect similar to the effect of classical agnosticism and they lead\n                    to
  a similar attitude toward religion. There is neither the classical\n                    atheistic
  denial that there is anything to the claims of religion nor\n                    is
  there the fideistic avowal that in spite of all their obscurity and seeming unintelligibility
  that there still is\n                    something there worthy of belief. Instead
  there is a\n                    genuine suspension of judgment.\n                The
  thing to ask is whether the doubts leading to a suspension of judgment\n                    are
  actually sufficient tojustify such a suspension or, everything considered,\n                    (1)
  would a leap of faith be more justified or (2) would the\n                    overcoming
  of doubt in the direction of atheism be more reasonable? Or is\n                    it
  the case that there is no way of making a rational decision here or of\n                    reasonably
  deciding what one ought to do or believe?\n                It may indeed be true,
  as many a sophisticated theo-\n                        logian has argued, that religious
  commitment is per- fectly compatible with a high degree of ignorance\n                    about
  God and the nature—whatever that may mean—of\n                    “ultimate reality.”
  But, if this is the case and if\n                    our ignorance here is as invincible
  as much contem- porary philosophical argumentation would have us\n                    believe,
  natural theology seems at least to be thor- oughly undermined. In trying to establish\n
  \                   whether the\n                     world is contingent or non-contingent,
  whether there is or can\n                    be something “beyond the world” upon
  which the world\n                    in some sense depends, or whether there is
  or could be an unlimited reality\n                    which is still in some sense
  personal, theological reasonings have been\n                        no- toriously
  unsuccessful. About the\n                    best that has been done is to establish
  that it is not entirely evident\n                    that these questions are meaningless
  or utterly unan- swerable.\n                Here a Barthian turn away from natural
  theology is equally fruitless. To say\n                    that man can by his own
  endeavors know nothing of God but simply must\n                    await an unpredictable
  and rationally inexplicable self- disclosure of God—the\n                    core
  notion of God revealing himself to man—is of no help, for\n                    when
  we look at religions in an honest anthropological light, we will\n                    see,
  when all the world is our stage, that we have multitudes of\n                    conflicting
  alleged revelations with no means at all of deciding, without\n                    the
  aid of natural theology or philosophical analysis, which, if any,\n                    of
  these putative revelations are genuine revelations. It is true\n                    enough
  that if something is actually a divine revelation, it cannot be\n                    assessed
  by man, but must simply be accepted. But the agnostic reminds the\n                        reve-
  lationist that we have a\n                    multitude of conflicting candi- date\n
  \                   revelations with no means of reasonably deciding which one to
  accept. In\n                    such a context a reasonable man will remain agnostic
  concerning such\n                    matters. To simply accept the authorative claims
  of a Church in such a\n                    circumstance is to fly in the face of
  reason.\n                The most crucial problem raised by the so-called truth-claims
  of Judaism and\n                    Christianity is that of conceivability—to borrow
  a term that\n                    Herbert Spencer used in the nineteenth century
  and thereby suggesting\n                    that there are more lines of continuity
  between the old agnosticism and the\n                    new than this essay has
  indi- cated. The incredibility—to use Spencer's\n                    contrasting
  term—of these central religious claims is tied, at\n                    least in
  part, to their inconceivability.\n                    “God” is not supposed to refer
  to a being among\n                    beings; by definition God is no finite object
  or process in the world. But\n                    then how is the referring to be
  done? What are we really talking about\n                    when we speak of God?
  How do we or can we fix the reference range of\n                    “God”? God surely
  cannot be identified in the same\n                    manner we identify the sole
  realities compatible with\n                    existence-monism. There can be no
  picking God out as we would a dis- crete entity in space-time. Alternatively\n                    there
  are theo- logians who will say that\n                    when we come to recognize
  that it is just a brute fact that there is that\n                    indefinitely
  immense collection of finite and contingent masses or\n                    conglomerations
  of things, we use the phrase “the\n                    world” to refer to, and when
  we recognize it could have been the\n                    case—eternally the case—that
  there was026\n                     no world at all, we can come quite naturally
  to feel puzzled\n                    about why there is a world at all.\n                Is
  there anything that would account for the exist-\n                        ence of
  all finite reality and not itself be a reality that\n                    needed
  to be similarly explained? In speaking of God we are speaking of\n                    such
  a reality, if indeed there is such a reality. We are concerned with a\n                    reality
  not simply—as the world might be—infinite in\n                    space and time,
  but a reality such that it would not make sense to ask\n                        why
  it exists. Such a reality could not be a\n                    physical reality.\n
  \               In sum, we have, if we reflect at all, a developing sense of the
  contingency\n                    of the world. The word “God” in part means, in
  Jewish\n                    and Christian discourses, whatever it is that is non-contingent
  upon which\n                    all these contingent realities continuously depend.
  God is the\n                    completeness that would fill in the essential incom-
  pleteness of the world. We have feelings of de- pendency, creatureliness, finitude
  and in\n                    having those feelings, it is argued, we have some sense
  of that which\n                    is without limit. “God” refers to such alleged\n
  \                   ultimate realities and to something richer as well. But surely
  this,\n                    the critic of agnosticism will reply, sufficiently fixes
  the reference\n                    range of “God,” such that it would be a mistake
  to\n                    assert that “God” is a term supposedly used to refer\n                    to
  a referent but nothing coherently specifiable counts as a possible\n                    referent
  for “God,” where “God”\n                    has a non-anthropomorphic employment.\n
  \               Surely such a referent is not something which can be clearly conceived,
  but,\n                    as we have seen, a non- mysterious God\n                    would
  not be the God of Judeo-\n                    Christianity. But has language gone
  on a holiday? We certainly,\n                    given our religious conditioning,
  have a \n                        feel- ing\n                     that we understand
  what we are saying here. But do we? Perhaps, as\n                    Axel Hägerström
  thought, “contin- gent thing,” “finite\n                    thing,” and “finite
  reality” are\n                    pleonastic. For anything at all that exists, we
  seem to be able to ask,\n                    without being linguistically or con-\n
  \                   ceptually deviant, why it exists. “The world” or\n                    “the
  cosmos” does not stand for an entity or a class of things, but is an umbrella term
  for all\n                    those things and their structural relations that religious
  people call\n                    “finite things” and many others just call\n                    “things.”
  What are we talking about when we say there\n                    is something infinite
  and utterly different from these “finite\n                    realities” and that
  this “utterly other\n                    reality” is neither physical nor temporal
  nor purely conceptual\n                    nor simply imagi- nary, but, while being\n
  \                   unique and radically distinct from all these things, continuously
  sustains\n                    all these “finite things” and is a mysterious\n                    something
  upon which they are utterly dependent? Surely this is very\n                    odd
  talk and “sustains” and\n                    “dependent” have no un-\n                        problematical
  use in this context.\n                These difficulties and a host of difficulties
  like them\n                     make it doubtful whether the discourse used to spell
  out the\n                    reference range of “God” is sufficiently intelli- gible
  to make such God-talk\n                    coherent. An agnostic of the contemporary
  sort is a man who suspends judg- ment, oscillating between rejecting\n                    God-talk
  as an irrational form of discourse containing at crucial junc- tures incoherent
  or rationally\n                    unjustifiable putative truth-claims and accepting
  this discourse as\n                    something which, obscure as it is, makes
  a sufficiently intelligible\n                    and humanly important reference
  to be worthy of belief.\n                One reading of the situation is that the
  network of fundamental concepts\n                    constitutive of nonanthropo-
  morphic\n                    God-talk in Judeo-Christianity is so problem-\n                        atical
  that the most reasonable thing to do is to opt for\n                    atheism,
  particularly when we realize that we do not need these religions\n                    or
  any religion to make sense of our lives or to buttress morality. But\n                    agnosticism,
  particularly of the contemporary kind specified here,\n                    need
  not be an evasion and perhaps is the most reason- able alternative for the individual
  who wishes, concern- ing an appraisal of competing world\n                    views
  and ways of life, to operate on a principle of maximum caution.\n                \n

  of the History of IdeasAgnosticism is a philosophical and theological\n                    concept
  which has been understood in various ways by different\n                    philosophers
  and theologians. T. H. Huxley coined the term in 1869, and its\n                    first
  home was in the disputes about science and religion, naturalism and\n                        super-
  naturalism, that reached a\n                    climax during the nineteenth century.
  To be an agnostic is to hold that\n                    nothing can be known or at
  least that it is very unlikely that any- thing will be known or soundly believed\n
  \                   concerning whether God or any transcendent reality or state
  exists.It is very natural for certain people conditioned in certain ways to believe\n
  \                   that there must be some power “behind,”\n                    “beyond,”
  or “underlying” the\n                    universe which is responsible for its order
  and all the incredible\n                    features that are observed and studied
  by the sciences even though these\n                    same people will readily
  grant that we do not know that there is such a\n                    power or have
  good grounds for believing that there is such a power.\n                    While
  the admission of ignorance concerning things divine is usually made\n                    by
  someone outside the circle of faith, it can and indeed has been made by\n                    fideistic
  Jews and Christians as well.Some writers, e.g., Robert Flint and James Ward, so
  construed\n                    “agnosticism” that (1) it was identified with\n                    “philosophical
  skepticism” and (2) it allowed for\n                    there being “theistic agnostics”
  and “Christian\n                        agnos- tics.” However, the more\n                    typical
  employment of “ag-\n                    nosticism” is such that it would not be
  correct to count\n                    as agnostics either fideistic believers or
  Jews and Chris- tians who claim that we can only gain knowledge of\n                    God
  through some mystical awareness or “ineffable\n                    knowledge.” It
  surely was this standard but more cir- cumscribed sense of\n                    “agnosticism”
  that William James\n                     had in mind when he made his famous remark
  in his essay\n                    “The Will to Believe” that agnosticism was the
  worst\n                    thing that “ever came out of the philosopher's\n                    workshop.”
  Without implying or suggesting any sup- port at all for James's value judgment,
  we shall\n                    construe agnosticism in this rather more typical manner.
  Given this\n                    construal (1) “theistic agnosticism” is a contra-
  diction and thus one cannot be a Jew\n                    or a Christian and be
  an agnostic and (2) also agnosticism is neutral vis-à-vis the claim that there can\n
  \                   be no philosophical knowledge or even scientific or common-sense
  knowl- edge. We shall then take agnosticism to\n                    be the more
  limited claim that we either do not or cannot know that\n                    God
  or any other transcendent reality or state exists and thus we should\n                    suspend
  judgment concerning the assertion that God exists. That is to say,\n                    the
  agnostic neither affirms nor denies it. This, as should be evident\n                    from
  the above characterization, can take further specification and indeed\n                    later
  such specifications will be supplied. But such a construal captures\n                    in
  its char- acterization both what was\n                    essentially at issue in
  the great agnostic debates in the nineteenth\n                    century and the
  issue as it has come down to us.T. H. Huxley was by training a biologist, but he
  had strong philosophical\n                    interests and as a champion of Darwinism
  he became a major intellectual\n                    figure in the nineteenth century.
  In his “Science and\n                    Christian Tradition” (in Collected\n                    Essays),
  Huxley remarks that agnosticism is a method, a stance taken\n                    toward
  putative religious truth-claims, the core of which is to refuse\n                    to
  assent to religious doctrines for which there is no adequate evidence,\n                    but
  to retain an open-mindedness about the possibility of sometime\n                    attaining
  adequate evidence. We ought never to assert that we know a\n                    proposition
  to be true or indeed even to assent to that proposition unless\n                    we
  have adequate evidence to sup- port it.After his youthful reading of the Scottish
  meta-\n                        physician William Hamilton's Philosophy of the\n
  \                           Un- conditioned (1829),\n                    Huxley
  repeatedly returned to questions about the limits of our possible\n                    knowledge
  and came, as did Leslie Stephen, to the empiricist\n                    conclusion
  that we cannot know anything about God or any alleged states or\n                    realities
  “beyond phenomena.” Whether there is a God,\n                    a world of demons,
  an immor- tal soul, whether\n                    indeed “the spiritual world” is
  other than human\n                    fantasy or projection, were all taken by Huxley
  to be factual questions open to careful and systematic empirical\n                    investigation.
  In short, however humanly important such questions were,\n                    they
  were also “matters of the intellect” and in such\n                    contexts theThis
  conviction is at the heart of his agnosticism. Huxley was convinced\n                    that
  Kant and Hamilton had established that reason fails us—and\n                    indeed
  must fail us—when we try to\n                    establish that the world is finite
  in space or time or indefinite in space\n                    or time, rational or
  irrational, an ordered whole or simply\n                    manifesting certain
  ordered features but not something properly to be\n                    called an
  ordered whole. Answers to such ques-\n                    tions reveal something
  about our attitudes but can never provide us\n                    with propositions
  we can justifiably claim to be true or even know to be\n                    false.
  Agnosticism is a confession of honesty here. It is “the\n                    only
  position for people who object to say that they know what they\n                    are
  quite aware they do not know” (p. 210).Such skepticism concerning the truth-claims
  of reli-\n                        gion and metaphysics, including, of course, meta-
  physical religiosity, should not be taken as a denial\n                    that
  there can be reliable knowledge. Rather Huxley argued, as John\n                    Dewey
  did far more systematically later, that we can and do gain\n                    experimental
  and ex- periential knowledge\n                    of nature, including human na-
  ture, and that\n                    this, by contrast with so-called “super- natural
  knowledge,” becomes increasingly more\n                        exten- sive and reliable.
  And while\n                    remaining an agnostic, Huxley saw in science—basically
  the\n                    scientific way of fixing belief—a fundamental and well
  grounded\n                        chal- lenge to the authority of the theory\n                    of
  the “spiritual world.”Whatever may have been the case in the seventeenth century,
  there was in\n                    Huxley's time a state of war between science and
  religion. Huxley took\n                    science to be a challenge to claims of
  biblical infallibility and\n                    revelation. The whole supernatural
  world view built on the authority of the\n                    Bible and revelation
  must come\n                     under scientific scrutiny and when this is done
  it be- comes gradually apparent that the use of the\n                    scientific
  method and appeals to scientific canons of criticism give\n                    us
  a far more reliable method of settling belief than do the scriptures and\n                    revelation.To
  commit ourselves to the Bible as an infallible authority is to commit\n                    ourselves
  to a world view in which we must believe that devils were cast\n                    out
  of a man and went into a herd of swine, that the deluge was\n                    universal,
  that the world was made in six days, and the like. Yet such\n                    claims
  are plainly and massively contravened by our actual empirical\n                    knowledge
  such that they are quite beyond the boundaries of respon- sible belief. About such
  matters,\n                    Huxley argues, we ought not to be at all agnostic.
  Moreover, we cannot\n                    take them simply as myths, important for
  the biblical and Christian\n                    understanding of the world, if we
  are to take seriously biblical\n                    infallibility and the authority
  of revelation. For the Jewish-Christian\n                    world view to establish
  its validity, it must provide us with adequate\n                    grounds for
  believing that there are demons. But there is no good evidence\n                    for
  such alleged realities and to believe in them is the grossest form of\n                    superstition
  (Huxley, p. 215).Even if we fall back on a severe Christology, we are still in difficulties,\n
  \                   for it is evident enough that Jesus believed in demons and if
  we are to\n                    adopt a radical Christology and take Jesus as our
  infallible guide to\n                    the divine, we are going to have to accept
  such super- stitious beliefs. Such beliefs affront not only our\n                        intel-
  lect—our credibility\n                    concerning what it is reasonable to believe—they
  also affront\n                    our moral sense as well (p. 226). Yet once we
  give up the Gospel claim\n                    that there are “demons who can be
  transferred from a man to\n                    a pig,” the other stories of “demonic
  possession fall\n                    under suspicion.” Once we start on this slide,
  once we challenge\n                    the ultimate authority of the Bible, and
  follow experimental and scientific\n                    procedures, the ground for
  the whole Judeo-Christian world view is\n                    undermined.Huxley obviously
  thinks its credibility and proba-\n                        bility is of a very low
  order; an order which would make\n                    Christian or Jewish belief
  quite impossible for a reasonable and tolerably\n                    well informed
  man. Those who claim to know that there are such unseen\n                    and
  indeed utterly unseeable realities, are very likely peo- ple who have taken “cunning
  phrases for\n                    answers,” where real answers are “not merely actually\n
  \                       impossi- ble, but theoretically\n                    inconceivable.”
  Yet as an agnostic one must\n                    always—even for such problematical
  trans- cendental claims—remain open to conviction\n                    where evidence
  can be brought to establish the truth of such\n                    transcendent
  religious claims.Leslie Stephen in his neglected An Agnostic's019\n                         Apology
  (1893) remarks that he uses\n                    “agnostic” in a sense close to
  that of T. H. Huxley.\n                    To be an agnostic, according to Stephen,
  is to reject what he calls\n                        “Dog- matic Atheism,”\n                    i.e.,
  “the doctrine that there is no God, whatever is meant by\n                    God...”;
  it is, instead, (1) to affirm “what no one\n                    denies,” namely
  “that there are limits to the sphere\n                    of human intelligence”
  and (2) also to affirm the controversial\n                    empiricist thesis
  “that those limits are such as to exclude at\n                    least what Lewes
  called 'Metempirical knowledge'” (p. 1).\n                    (“Metempirical knowledge”
  is meant to designate all\n                    forms of knowl- edge of a transcendent,\n
  \                   numinal, nonempirical sort.)Stephen makes apparent the empiricist
  commit-\n                    ments of his conception of agnosticism in charac- terizing
  gnosticism, the view agnosticism is\n                    deliberately set against.
  To be a gnostic is to believe that “we\n                    can attain truths not
  capable of verification and not needing\n                    verification by actual
  experiment or observation” (ibid., pp.\n                    1-2). In gaining such
  a knowledge gnostics in opposition to both Hume and\n                    Kant claim
  that by the use of our reason we can attain a knowledge\n                    that
  transcends “the narrow limits of experience” (p.\n                    1). But the
  agnostic, firmly in the empiricist tradition, denies that\n                    there
  can be any knowledge of the world, includ-\n                    ing anything about
  its origin and destiny, which tran- scends experience and comprehends “the sorry\n
  \                   scheme of things entire.” Such putative knowledge, Stephen\n
  \                   maintains, is illusory and not something “essential to the\n
  \                   highest interests of mankind,” providing us, as speculative\n
  \                   metaphysicians believe, with the solution to “the dark riddle
  of\n                    the universe” (p. 2).In a manner that anticipates the challenge
  to the claims of religion and\n                    metaphysics made by the logical
  empiricists, Stephen says that in addition\n                    to the prob- lem
  of whether they can establish\n                    the truth or probable truth of
  “religious\n                    truth-claims” there is the further\n                    consideration—actually
  a logically prior question—of\n                    whether such putative claims
  “have any meaning” (p.\n                    3).It should be noted that Stephen does
  not begin “An Agnostic's\n                    Apology” by discussing semantical
  diffi- culties in putative religious truth-claims but starts\n                    with
  problems connected with what W. K. Clifford was later to call\n                    “the
  ethics of belief.” We indeed would all\n                    want—if we could do
  it honestly—to accept the claim\n                    that “evil is transitory...
  good eternal” and that\n                    the “world is really an embodiment of
  love and wisdom,\n                    however dark it may appear to us” (p. 2).
  But the rub is that\n                    many of us cannot believe that and in a
  question of such inestimable human\n                    value, we have “the most
  sacred obligations to recognize the\n                    facts” and make our judgments
  in accordance with the facts. But\n                    the facts do not give us
  grounds for confidence in the viability of\n                    Judeo-Christian
  beliefs. Rather we are\n                     strongly inclined when we inspect these
  beliefs to believe they\n                    are wish fulfillments. And while it
  may indeed be true that for the moment\n                    dreams may be pleasanter
  than realities, it is also true that if we\n                    are bent on attaining
  a more permanent measure of happi- ness, it “must be won by adapting our lives\n
  \                   to the realities,” for we know from experience that\n                    illusory
  consolations “are the bitterest of\n                    mockeries” (ibid.). The
  religious platitudes “Pain is\n                    not an evil,” “Death is not a
  separation,”\n                    and “Sickness is but a blessing in disguise” have\n
  \                   tortured sufferers far more than “the gloomiest speculations
  of\n                    avowed pessimists” (ibid.).However, the problem of meaning
  cuts to a deeper\n                    conceptual level than do such arguments about
  the ethics of belief. Where\n                    Judeo-Christianity does not have
  a fideistic basis, it is committed to what\n                    Stephen calls gnosticism.
  But does not such a doctrine fail\n                    “to recognize the limits
  of possible knowledge” and\n                    in trying to transcend these limits
  does it not in effect commit the\n                    gnostic to pseudo-propositions
  which are devoid of literal meaning? Logical\n                    empiricists later
  answered this question in the affirmative and while\n                    it is not
  crystal clear that Stephen's answer is quite that definite,\n                    it
  would appear that this is what he wants to maintain. And if that is what\n                    Stephen
  is maintaining, there can, of course, be no knowledge of the\n                    divine.Stephen
  raises this key question concerning the intelligibility of such\n                    gnostic
  God-talk, but he does little with it. Instead he focuses on some\n                    key
  questions concerning attempts by theologians to undermine\n                    agnosticism.
  He first points out that an appeal to rev- elation is no answer to the agnostic's
  denial that we\n                    have knowledge of transcendent realities or
  states, for in claiming to rely\n                    exclusively on revelation these
  theologians acknowledge that\n                    “natural man can know nothing
  of the Divine nature.”\n                    But this Stephen replies, is not only
  to grant but in effect to assert the\n                    agnostic's fundamental
  principle (p. 5). He points out that H. L.\n                    Mansel in effect
  and in substance affirms agnosticism and that Cardinal\n                    Newman
  with his appeal to the testimony of conscience does not provide a\n                    reliable
  argument on which to base a belief in God nor does he\n                    undermine
  the agnostic's position, for “the voice of conscience\n                    has been
  very differently interpreted.” Some of these\n                    interpretations,
  secular though they be, have all the appearances of being\n                    at
  least as valid as Newman's, for all that Newman or anyone else has\n                    shown.
  Moreover, on any reasonable reading of a prin-\n                        ciple of
  parsimony, they are far simpler than Newman's\n                    interpretation.
  Thus Newman's arguments in reality prove, as do Mansel's,\n                    that
  a man ought to be an agnostic concerning such ultimate questions\n                    where
  reason remains his guide and where he does not make an appeal to\n                    the
  authority of the Church. They, ofLike Huxley, and like Hume before him, Stephen
  is skeptical of the a priori arguments of metaphysics and natural\n                    theology.
  “There is not a single proof of natural\n                    theology,” he asserts,
  “of which the negative has not\n                    been maintained as vigorously
  as the affirmative” (p. 9). In\n                    such a context, where there
  is no substantial agreement, but just endless\n                    and irre- solvable
  philosophical\n                    controversy, it is the duty of a reasonable man
  to profess ignorance (p.\n                    9). In trying to escape the bounds
  of sense—in trying to gain\n                    some metempirical knowledge—philosophers
  continue to\n                    contradict flatly the first principles of their
  prede- cessors and no vantage point is attained where we\n                    can
  objectively assess these endemic metaphysical conflicts that\n                    divide
  philosophers. To escape utter skepticism, we must be agnostics and\n                    argue
  that such metaphysical and theological controversies lead to\n                    “transcending
  the limits of reason” (p. 10). But the\n                    only widely accepted
  characterization of these limits “comes in\n                    substance to an
  exclusion of ontology” and an adherence to\n                    empirically based
  truth-claims as the only legitimate truth-claims.It will not help, Stephen argues,
  to maintain that the Numinous, i.e., the\n                    divine, is essentially
  mysterious and that religious\n                    understanding—a seeing through
  a glass darkly—is a\n                    knowledge of something which is irreducibly
  and inescapably mysterious. In\n                    such talk in such contexts,
  there is linguistic legerdemain: we call\n                    our doubts mysteries
  and what is now being ap-\n                    pealed to as “the mystery of faith”
  is but the\n                        theolog- ical phrase for agnosticism (p.\n                    22).Stephen
  argues that one could believe knowledge of the standard types was\n                    quite
  possible and indeed actual and remain skeptical about metaphysics. It\n                    is
  just such a position that many (perhaps most) contem- porary philosophers would
  take. In taking this\n                    position himself, Stephen came to believe
  that metaphysical claims are\n                    “nothing but the bare husks of
  meaningless words.” To\n                    gain genuine knowledge, we must firmly
  put aside such meaningless\n                    metaphysical claims and recognize
  the more limited extent of our\n                    knowledge claims. A firm recognition
  here will enable us to avoid\n                    utter skepticism because we come
  to see that within\n                     the limits of the experiential “we have
  been able to\n                    discover certain reliable truths” and with them
  “we\n                    shall find sufficient guidance for the needs of life” (p.
  26).\n                    So while we remain religious skeptics and skeptical of
  the claims of\n                    transcendental metaphysics, we are not generally
  skeptical about man's\n                    capacity to attain reliable knowledge.
  Yet it remains the case that\n                    nothing is known or can be known,
  of the alleged “ultimate\n                    reality”—the Infinite and Absolute—of
  tra- ditional metaphysics and natural theology\n                    (p. 26). And
  thus nothing can be known of God.Before moving on to a consideration of some twen-
  tieth-century formulations of agnosticism and to a\n                    critical
  examination of all forms of agnosticism, let us consider briefly a\n                    question
  that the above charac-\n                    terization of Huxley and Stephen certainly
  should give rise to.\n                    Given the correctness of the above criticisms
  of Judaism and Christianity,\n                    do we not have good grounds for
  rejecting these religions and is not this\n                    in effect an espousal
  of atheism rather than agnosticism?We should answer differently for Huxley than
  we do for Stephen. Huxley's\n                    arguments, if correct, would give
  us good grounds for rejecting\n                    Christianity and Judaism; but
  they are not sufficient by themselves\n                    for jettisoning a belief
  in God, though they would require us to\n                    suspend judgment about
  the putative knowledge-\n                        claim that God exists and created
  the world. But it must be\n                    remembered that agnosticism is the
  general claim that we do not know and\n                    (more typically) cannot
  know or have good grounds for believing that there\n                    is a God.
  But to accept this is not to accept the claim that there is\n                    no
  God, unless we accept the premiss that what cannot even in principle be\n                    known
  cannot exist. This was not a premiss to which Huxley and Stephen\n                    were
  committed. Rather they accepted the standard agnostic view that\n                    since
  we cannot know or have good reasons for believing that God exists we\n                    should
  suspend judg- ment concerning his\n                    existence or nonexistence.
  More- over, as we\n                    shall see, forms of Jewish and Christian
  fideism when linked with modern\n                    biblical scholarship could
  accept at least most of Huxley's arguments\n                    and still defend
  an acceptance of the Jewish or Christian faith.Stephen's key arguments are more
  epistemologically oriented and are more\n                    definitely committed
  to an empiricist account of meaning and the limits of\n                        con-
  ceivability. As we shall see in\n                    examining the conten- tions
  of some\n                    contemporary critics of religion, it is more difficult
  to see what, given\n                    the correctness of Stephen's own account,
  it could mean to affirm, deny, or even doubt the existence of God. The very\n                    concept
  of God on such an account becomes problematical. AndThe cultural context in which
  we speak of religion is very different in the\n                    twentieth century
  than it was in the nineteenth (cf. MacIntyre, Ricoeur).\n                    For
  most twentieth-century people with even a minimal amount of\n                    education,
  the authority of science has cut much deeper than it did in\n                    previous
  centuries. The cosmo- logical\n                    claims in the biblical stories
  are no longer taken at face value by the\n                    overwhelming majority
  of edu- cated people both\n                    religious and non-religious. Theolo-
  gians\n                    working from within the circle of faith have carried
  out an extensive\n                    program of de-mythologizing such biblical
  claims. Thus it is evident that\n                    in one quite obvious respect
  the nineteenth-century agnostics have\n                    clearly been victorious.
  There is no longer any serious attempt to defend\n                    the truth
  of the cosmological claims in the type of biblical stories that\n                    Huxley
  discusses.However, what has not received such wide accept-\n                    ance
  is the claim that the acceptance of such a de- mythologizing undermines Judaism
  and\n                    Christianity and drives an honest man in the direction
  of agnos- ticism or atheism. Many would claim\n                    that such de-
  mythologizing only\n                    purifies Judaism and Christianity of extraneous
  cultural material. The\n                    first thing to ask is whether or not
  a steady recognition of the fact\n                    that these biblical stories
  are false supports agnosticism as strongly\n                    as Huxley thinks
  it does.Here the new historical perspective on the Bible is a crucial factor. The\n
  \                   very concept of the authority of the Bible undergoes a sea change
  with the\n                    new look in historical scholarship. It is and has
  been widely\n                    acknowledged both now and in the nineteenth century
  that Judaism and\n                    Christianity are both integrally linked with
  certain historical claims.\n                    They are not sufficient to establish
  the truth of either of these\n                    religions, but they are necessary.
  Yet modern historical\n                    research—to put it minimally—places many
  of these\n                    historical claims in an equivocal light and makes
  it quite im- possible to accept claims about the literal\n                    infallibility
  of the Bible. Conservative evangelicalists (funda- mentalists) try to resist this
  tide\n                    and in reality still battle with Huxley. They reject the
  basic findings\n                    of modern biblical scholarship and in contrast
  to mod- ernists treat the Bible not as a fallible and\n                    myth-laden
  account of God's self-revelation in history but as a fully\n                    inspired
  and infallible historical record. Conservative evangelicalists\n                    agree
  with modernists that revelation consists in God's self-disclosure to\n                    man,
  but they further believe that the Bible is an infallible testimony of\n                    God's
  self-unveiling. Modernists by contrast believe that we must\n                    discover
  what the crucial historical but yet divine events and realities\n                    are
  like by a painstaking historical investigation of the biblical\n                    material.
  This involves all\n                     the techniques of modern historical research.
  The vari- ous accounts in the Bible must be sifted by\n                    methodical
  inquiry and independently acquired knowledge of the culture\n                    and
  the times must be used whenever possible.Conservative evangelicalism is still strong
  as a cul-\n                        tural phenomenon in North America, though it
  is steadily losing\n                    strength. However it is not a serious influence
  in the major seminaries and\n                    modernism has thoroughly won the
  day in the intellectually respect- able centers of Jewish and Christian\n                    learning.
  Huxley's arguments do come into conflict with conservative\n                    evangelicalism
  and his arguments about the plain fal-\n                        sity, utter incoherence,
  and sometimes questionable morality of\n                    the miracle stories
  and stories of Jesus' actions would have to be met by\n                    such
  conservative evangelicalists. But the modernists would be on\n                    Huxley's
  side here. So, for a large and respectable element of the Jewish\n                    and
  Christian community, Huxley's arguments, which lead him to reject Christi- anity
  and accept agnosticism, are\n                    accepted but not taken as at all
  undermining the foundations of\n                    Judaism or Christianity.Huxley's
  sort of endeavor, like the more systematic endeavors of David\n                    Strauss,
  simply helps Christians rid the world of the historically\n                    contingent
  cultural trap- pings of the\n                    biblical writers. Once this has
  been cut away, modernists argue, the true\n                    import of the biblical
  message can be seen as something of decisive\n                    relevance that
  transcends the vicissitudes of time.However, this is not all that should be said
  vis-à-vis the conflict\n                    between science and religion and agnos-\n
  \                   ticism. It is often said that the conflict between science and\n
  \                   religion came to a head in the nineteenth century and now has
  been\n                    transcended. Science, it is averred, is now seen to be
  neutral concerning\n                    materialism or any other metaphysical thesis
  and theology—the\n                        en- terprise of attempting to provide\n
  \                   ever deeper, clearer, and more reasonable statements and explications
  of\n                    the truths of religion—is more sophisticated and less vul-
  nerable to attacks by science or\n                    scientifically oriented thinkers.
  Still it may be the case that there\n                    remain some conflicts between
  science and religion which have not been\n                    overcome even with
  a sophisticated analysis of religion, where that\n                    analysis takes
  the religions of the world and Christianity and Judaism in\n                    particular
  to be making truth-claims.Let us consider how such difficulties might arise. Most
  Christians, for\n                    example, would want to claim as something central
  to their religion that\n                    Christ rose from the dead and that there
  is a life after the death of\n                    our earthly bodies. These claims
  seem at least to run athwart our\n                    scientific understanding of
  the world so that it is difficult to know how\n                    we could both
  accept scientific method as the most reliable method of settlingGiven such a dilemma,
  the agnostic or atheist could then go on to claim that\n                    either
  these key religious utterances do not function propositionally as\n                        truth-
  claims at all or there is indeed\n                    such a clash. But if there
  is such a clash, the scientific claims are\n                    clearly the claims
  to be preferred, for of all the rival ways of\n                    fixing belief,
  the scientific way of fixing belief is clearly the most\n                    reliable.
  Thus if there are good empir- ical,\n                    scientific reasons (as
  there are) for thinking that people who die are not\n                    resurrected,
  that when our earthly bodies die we die, and that there is no\n                    evidence
  at all, and indeed not even any clear meaning to the claim\n                    that
  there are “resurrection bodies” and a\n                        “res- urrection\n
  \                   world” utterly distinct from the cosmos, we have the strongest\n
  \                   of reasons for not accepting the Christian claim that “Christ\n
  \                   rose from the Dead.” The scientific beliefs in conflict with\n
  \                   that belief are ones that it would be foolish to jettison. But
  it is\n                    only by a sacrifice of our scientific way of conceiving
  of things that\n                    we could assent to such a central religious
  claim. Thus it is fair to say\n                    that our scientific under- standing
  drives\n                    us in the direction of either atheism or agnosticism.Some
  contemporary theologians have responded to such contentions by arguing\n                    that
  there are good con- ceptual reasons why\n                    there could not be,
  appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, such a\n                    conflict.
  “Christ” is not equivalent to\n                    “Jesus” but to “the son of God”\n
  \                   and God is not a physical reality. Christianity centers on a
  belief in a\n                    deity who is beyond the world, who is creator of
  the world. But such a\n                    reality is in principle, since it is
  transcendent to the cosmos, not\n                    capable of being investigated
  scientifically but must\n                     be understood in some other way. God
  in his proper\n                    non-anthropomorphic forms is beyond the reach
  of evidence. Only crude\n                    anthropomorphic forms of Christian
  belief could be disproved by modern\n                        scien- tific investigations.To
  believe that Christ rose from the dead is to be committed to a belief in\n                    miracles.
  But, it has been forcefully argued by Ninian Smart, this does not\n                        com-
  mit us to something which is\n                    anti-scientific or that can be
  ruled out a priori\n                    (Smart [1964], Ch. II; [1966], pp. 44-45).
  A miracle is an event of divine\n                    significance which is an exception
  to at least one law of nature.\n                    Scientific laws are not, it
  is important to remember, falsified by single\n                    exceptions but
  only by a class of experimentally repeatable events. Thus we\n                    can
  believe in the miracle of Christ's resurrection without clashing\n                    with
  anything sanctioned by science. It is a dogma, the critic of\n                    agnosticism
  could continue, to think that everything that can be known can\n                    be
  known by the method of science or by simple observation. A thor- oughly scientific
  mind quite devoid of\n                    credulity could remain committed to Judaism
  or Christianity, believe\n                    in God, and accept such crucial miracle
  stories without abandoning a\n                    scientific attitude, i.e., he
  could accept all the findings of science and\n                    accept its authority
  as the most efficient method for ascertaining what is\n                    the case
  when ascertaining what is the case comes to predicting and\n                    retrodicting
  classes of experimentally repeatable events or processes.Christians as well as agnostics
  can and do recognize the obscurity and\n                    mysteriousness of religious
  claims. The Christian should go on to say that\n                    a nonmysterious
  God, a God whose reality is evident, would not be the\n                    God of
  Judeo-Christianity—the God to be accepted on faith with\n                    fear
  and trembling. It is only for a God who moves in mysterious ways, that\n                    the
  characteristic Jewish and Christian attitudes of discipleship, adora- tion, and
  faith are appropriate. If the\n                    existence of God and what it
  was to act in accordance with His will\n                    were perfectly evident
  or clearly establishable by hard intellectual work,\n                    faith would
  lose its force and ration- ale.\n                    Faith involves risk, trust,
  and commitment. Judaism or Christianity is not\n                    something one
  simply must be- lieve in if one\n                    will only think the matter
  through as clearly and honestly as possible.What is evident is that the agnosticism
  of a Huxley and a Stephen at\n                    least—and a Bertrand Russell as
  well—rests on a\n                    philosophical view not dictated by science.
  James Ward saw this around the\n                    turn of the century and argued
  in his Naturalism and\n                        Agnosticism that agnosticism “is
  an inherently unstable\n                    position” unless it is supplemented
  by some general\n                    philosophical view such as materialism or idealism
  (p. 21). Yet it isIn sum, the claim is that only if such an overall philosophical
  view is\n                    justified is it the case that there may be good grounds
  for being an\n                    agnostic rather than a Christian or a Jew. The
  overall position\n                    necessary for such a justification is either
  a position of empiricism\n                    or materialism and if it is the former
  it must be a form of empiricism\n                    which in Karl Popper's terms
  is also a scientism. By this we mean the claim\n                    that there are
  no facts which science cannot explore: that what can- not at least in principle
  be known by the\n                    method of science cannot be known. Where alternatively
  scien- tism is part of a reductive materialist\n                    metaphysics,
  there is a commitment to what has been called an\n                    “existence-monism,”
  namely, the view that there is\n                    only one sort of level or order
  of existence and that is spatiotemporal\n                    existence. That is
  to say, such an existence-monist believes that to exist\n                    is
  to have a place in space-time. In support of this, he may point out\n                    that
  we can always ask about a thing that is supposed to exist where it exists. This,
  it is claimed, indicates how\n                    we in reality operate on materialist
  assumptions. And note that if that\n                    question is not apposite,
  “exists” and its\n                    equivalents are not being employed in their
  standard\n                    senses, but are being used in a secondary sense as
  in “Ghosts\n                    and gremlins exist merely in one's mind.” Besides\n
  \                   existence-monism there is the even more per-\n                    vasive
  and distinctively empiricist position—a position\n                    shared by
  the logical empiricists, by Bertrand Russell, and by John\n                    Dewey—referred
  to as “methodological- monism”: to wit “that all\n                    statements
  of fact are such that they can be investigated scientifically,\n                    i.e.,
  that they can in principle be falsified by\n                    observation” (Smart
  [1966], p. 8).However, critics of agnosticism have responded, as has Ninian Smart,
  by\n                    pointing out that these philo- sophical\n                    positions
  are vulnerable to a variety of fairly obvious and long-standing\n                    criticisms.
  Perhaps these criticisms can be and have been met, but these\n                    positions
  are highly controversial. If agnosticism is tied to them, do\n                    we
  not have as good grounds for being skeptical of agnosticism as the\n                    agnostics
  have for being skeptical of the claims of religion.Some samplings of the grounds
  for being skeptical about the philosophical\n                    underpinnings for
  agnosticism are these. When I suddenly remember that I\n                    left
  my key in my car, it makes sense to speak of the space-time\n                    location
  of my car but, it is at least plausibly argued, not of the\n                    space-time
  location of my sudden thought. Moreover numbers exist but it\n                    hardly
  makes sense to ask where they exist. It is\n                    not the case that
  for all\n                     standard uses of “exist” that to exist is to\n                    have
  a place in space-time. Methodological-monism is also beset with\n                    difficulties.
  There are in science theoretically unobservable entities and\n                    “from
  quite early times, the central concepts of religion, such\n                    as
  God and nirvana already include the notion that what they stand for\n                    cannot
  literally be observed” (Smart [1962], p. 8). Moreover it\n                    is
  not evident that we could falsify state-\n                    ments such as “There
  are some graylings in\n                    Michigan” or “Every human being has some
  neurotic\n                    traits” or “Photons really exist, they are not simply\n
  \                   scientific fictions.” Yet we do recognize them (or so at least\n
  \                   it would seem) as intelligible statements of fact. Such considerations\n
  \                   lead Ninian Smart to claim confidently in his The Teacher\n
  \                       and Christian Belief (London, 1966) that “it remains\n                    merely
  a dogma to claim that all facts are facts about moons and flowers\n                    and
  humans and other denizens of the cosmos. There need be no general\n                    embargo
  upon belief in a transcendent reality, pro-\n                        vided such
  belief is not merely based on uncontrolled\n                    speculation” (p.
  51). Smart goes on to conclude that\n                    “the exclusion of transcendent
  fact rests on a mere\n                    decision” (p. 52). So it would appear,
  from what has been said\n                    above, that agnosticism has no solid
  rational foundation.The dialectic of the argument over agnosticism is not nearly
  at an end and\n                    it shall be the burden of the argument here to
  establish that agnosticism\n                    still has much to be said for it.
  First of all, even granting, for the\n                    reasons outlined above,
  that neither the develop-\n                        ment of science nor an appeal
  to scientism or empiri- cism establishes agnosticism, there are other consid- erations
  which give it strong\n                    support. David Hume'sDialogues on Natural
  Religion (1779) and Immanuel\n                    Kant's Critique of Pure Reason
  (1781) make it quite\n                    evident that none of the proofs for the
  existence of God work, i.e., they\n                    are not sound or reliable
  argu- ments.\n                    Furthermore it should be noted that their ar-\n
  \                   guments do not for the most part depend for their force on\n
  \                   empiricist assumptions and they most certainly do not depend
  on the\n                    development of science.The most rigorous contemporary
  work in the philos-\n                        ophy of religion has not always supported
  the detailed arguments\n                    of Hume and Kant but it has for the
  most part supported their overall\n                    conclusions on this issue.
  Alvin Plantinga, for example, in his God and Other Minds (1967) rejects rather thoroughly\n
  \                   the principles and assumptions of both existence-monism and
  metho- dological-monism and he\n                    subjects the particulars of
  Hume's and Kant's views to careful criticism,\n                    yet in the very
  course of giving a defense of what he takes to be the\n                    rationality
  of Christian belief, he argues that none of the attempts at a\n                    demonstration
  of the exist-In the twentieth century a distinct element comes to the fore which
  counts\n                    in favor of agnosticism but also gives it a particular
  twist. This new turn\n                    leads to a reformulation of agnosticism.
  It states agnosticism in such\n                    a manner that it becomes evident
  how it is a relevant response to one of\n                    the major elements
  in contemporary philosophical perplexities over\n                    religion.We
  have hitherto been talking as if God-talk is used in certain central\n                    contexts
  to make statements of whose truth-value we are in doubt. That is,\n                    there
  is no doubt that they have a truth-value but there is a doubt\n                    which
  truth-value they actually have. Theists think that at least some\n                    of
  the key Jewish or Christian claims are true, atheists think they are\n                    false,
  and traditional agnos- tics, as H. H.\n                    Price puts it in his
  Belief (London, 1969), suspend\n                    “judgement on the ground that
  we do not have sufficient evidence\n                    to decide the question and
  so far as he [the agnostic] can tell there is no\n                    likelihood
  that we ever shall have” (p. 455). But in the\n                    twentieth century
  with certain analytic philosophers the question has\n                    come to
  the fore about whether these key religious utterances have any\n                    truth-value
  at all.A. J. Ayer defending the modern variety of em-\n                        piricism
  called “logical empiricism” argued in hisLanguage, Truth and Logic (London, 1935)
  that such\n                    key religious utterances are devoid of cognitive
  mean-\n                        ing. Such considerations lead Ayer to deny that he
  or anyone\n                    taking such a position could be either a theist,
  an atheist, or even an\n                    agnostic. In a well known passage Ayer
  comments that it is very important\n                    not to confuse his view
  with agnosticism or atheism, for, as he puts\n                    it,It is a characteristic
  of an agnostic to hold that the existence of\n                            a god
  is a possibility in which there is no good reason either to\n                            believe
  or disbelieve; and it is characteristic of an atheist to\n                            hold
  that it is at least probable that no god exists. And our view\n                            that
  all utterances about the nature of God are nonsensical, so far\n                            from
  being identical with, or even lending any support to, either\n                            of
  these familiar contentions, is actually incompatible with them.\n                            For
  if the assertion that there is a god is nonsensical, then the\n                            atheist's
  assertion that there is no god is equally nonsensical,\n                            since
  it is only a significant proposition that can be significantly\n                             contradicted.
  As for the agnostic, although he refrains\n                            from saying
  either that there is or that there is not a god,\n                            he
  does not deny that the question whether a transcendent god\n                            exists
  is a genuine question. He does not deny that the two\n                            sentences
  “There is a transcendent god” and\n                            “There is no transcendent
  god” express\n                            propositions one of which is actually
  true and the other false. All\n                            he says is that we have
  no means of telling which of them is true,\n                            and therefore
  ought not to commit ourselves to either. But we have\n                            seen
  that the sentences in question do not express\n                            propositions
  at all. And this means that agnosticism also is ruled\n                            out\n
  \                       (p. 219).\n                    Ayer goes on to remark that
  the theist's putative claims are neither valid\n                    nor invalid;
  they say nothing at all and thus the theist cannot rightly be\n                    “accused
  of saying anything false, or anything for which he has\n                    insufficient
  grounds” (ibid., p. 219). It is only when the\n                    Christian, so
  to speak, turns meta-theologian and claims that in\n                    asserting
  the existence of a Transcendent God he is expressing a genuine\n                    proposition
  “that we are entitled to disagree with\n                    him” (ibid.).The central
  point Ayer is making is that such reli-\n                        gious utterances
  do not assert anything and thus they can be\n                    neither doubted,
  believed, nor even asserted to be false. With such\n                    considerations
  pushed to the front, the key question becomes whether such\n                    religious
  utterances have any informative content at all.There is something very strange here.
  Ayer, as we have seen, does not regard\n                    his position as atheistical
  or agnostic, for since such key religious\n                    utterances could
  not even be false, they could not be intelligibly\n                    denied and
  since they make no claim to be intelligibly questioned, they\n                    could
  not be sensibly doubted. But, as Susan Stebbing rightly observed,\n                    “the
  plain man would not find it easy to see the difference\n                    between
  Mr. Ayer's non-atheism and the fool's atheism” (Steb- bing, p. 264). But before
  we say\n                    “so much the worse for the plain man,” we should\n                    remember
  that to believe that such key religious utterances are\n                    unbelievable
  because nonsensical is even a more basic rejection of\n                    religious
  belief than simply asserting the falsity of the putative\n                    truth-claims
  of Christianity, but allowing for the possibility that they might be true.Because
  of this altered conceptualization of the situ-\n                        ation, Price,
  Edwards, and Nielsen have characterized both\n                    agnosticism and
  atheism in a broader and more adequate way which takes into\n                    account
  these problems about meaning. A contemporary agnostic who is\n                    alert
  to such questions about meaning would maintain that judgments\n                    concerning
  putatively assertive God-talk should be suspended for either of\n                    two
  reasons, depend- ing on the exact nature\n                    of the God-talk in
  question: (1) the claims, though genuine truth-claims,\n                    are
  without sufficient evidence to warrant either their belief orThe contemporary agnostic
  sensitive to problems about the logical status of\n                    religious
  utterances simply stresses that the reasonable and on the whole\n                    justified
  course of action here is simply to suspend judgment. His\n                    doubts
  are primarily doubts about the possibility of\n                        there being
  anything to doubt, but, second-order as they are, they\n                    have
  an effect similar to the effect of classical agnosticism and they lead\n                    to
  a similar attitude toward religion. There is neither the classical\n                    atheistic
  denial that there is anything to the claims of religion nor\n                    is
  there the fideistic avowal that in spite of all their obscurity and seeming unintelligibility
  that there still is\n                    something there worthy of belief. Instead
  there is a\n                    genuine suspension of judgment.The thing to ask
  is whether the doubts leading to a suspension of judgment\n                    are
  actually sufficient tojustify such a suspension or, everything considered,\n                    (1)
  would a leap of faith be more justified or (2) would the\n                    overcoming
  of doubt in the direction of atheism be more reasonable? Or is\n                    it
  the case that there is no way of making a rational decision here or of\n                    reasonably
  deciding what one ought to do or believe?It may indeed be true, as many a sophisticated
  theo-\n                        logian has argued, that religious commitment is per-
  fectly compatible with a high degree of ignorance\n                    about God
  and the nature—whatever that may mean—of\n                    “ultimate reality.”
  But, if this is the case and if\n                    our ignorance here is as invincible
  as much contem- porary philosophical argumentation would have us\n                    believe,
  natural theology seems at least to be thor- oughly undermined. In trying to establish\n
  \                   whether the\n                     world is contingent or non-contingent,
  whether there is or can\n                    be something “beyond the world” upon
  which the world\n                    in some sense depends, or whether there is
  or could be an unlimited reality\n                    which is still in some sense
  personal, theological reasonings have been\n                        no- toriously
  unsuccessful. About the\n                    best that has been done is to establish
  that it is not entirely evident\n                    that these questions are meaningless
  or utterly unan- swerable.Here a Barthian turn away from natural theology is equally
  fruitless. To say\n                    that man can by his own endeavors know nothing
  of God but simply must\n                    await an unpredictable and rationally
  inexplicable self- disclosure of God—the\n                    core notion of God
  revealing himself to man—is of no help, for\n                    when we look at
  religions in an honest anthropological light, we will\n                    see,
  when all the world is our stage, that we have multitudes of\n                    conflicting
  alleged revelations with no means at all of deciding, without\n                    the
  aid of natural theology or philosophical analysis, which, if any,\n                    of
  these putative revelations are genuine revelations. It is true\n                    enough
  that if something is actually a divine revelation, it cannot be\n                    assessed
  by man, but must simply be accepted. But the agnostic reminds the\n                        reve-
  lationist that we have a\n                    multitude of conflicting candi- date\n
  \                   revelations with no means of reasonably deciding which one to
  accept. In\n                    such a context a reasonable man will remain agnostic
  concerning such\n                    matters. To simply accept the authorative claims
  of a Church in such a\n                    circumstance is to fly in the face of
  reason.The most crucial problem raised by the so-called truth-claims of Judaism
  and\n                    Christianity is that of conceivability—to borrow a term
  that\n                    Herbert Spencer used in the nineteenth century and thereby
  suggesting\n                    that there are more lines of continuity between
  the old agnosticism and the\n                    new than this essay has indi- cated.
  The incredibility—to use Spencer's\n                    contrasting term—of these
  central religious claims is tied, at\n                    least in part, to their
  inconceivability.\n                    “God” is not supposed to refer to a being
  among\n                    beings; by definition God is no finite object or process
  in the world. But\n                    then how is the referring to be done? What
  are we really talking about\n                    when we speak of God? How do we
  or can we fix the reference range of\n                    “God”? God surely cannot
  be identified in the same\n                    manner we identify the sole realities
  compatible with\n                    existence-monism. There can be no picking God
  out as we would a dis- crete entity in space-time. Alternatively\n                    there
  are theo- logians who will say that\n                    when we come to recognize
  that it is just a brute fact that there is that\n                    indefinitely
  immense collection of finite and contingent masses or\n                    conglomerations
  of things, we use the phrase “the\n                    world” to refer to, and when
  we recognize it could have been the\n                    case—eternally the case—that
  there wasIs there anything that would account for the exist-\n                        ence
  of all finite reality and not itself be a reality that\n                    needed
  to be similarly explained? In speaking of God we are speaking of\n                    such
  a reality, if indeed there is such a reality. We are concerned with a\n                    reality
  not simply—as the world might be—infinite in\n                    space and time,
  but a reality such that it would not make sense to ask\n                        why
  it exists. Such a reality could not be a\n                    physical reality.In
  sum, we have, if we reflect at all, a developing sense of the contingency\n                    of
  the world. The word “God” in part means, in Jewish\n                    and Christian
  discourses, whatever it is that is non-contingent upon which\n                    all
  these contingent realities continuously depend. God is the\n                    completeness
  that would fill in the essential incom- pleteness of the world. We have feelings
  of de- pendency, creatureliness, finitude and in\n                    having those
  feelings, it is argued, we have some sense of that which\n                    is
  without limit. “God” refers to such alleged\n                    ultimate realities
  and to something richer as well. But surely this,\n                    the critic
  of agnosticism will reply, sufficiently fixes the reference\n                    range
  of “God,” such that it would be a mistake to\n                    assert that “God”
  is a term supposedly used to refer\n                    to a referent but nothing
  coherently specifiable counts as a possible\n                    referent for “God,”
  where “God”\n                    has a non-anthropomorphic employment.Surely such
  a referent is not something which can be clearly conceived, but,\n                    as
  we have seen, a non- mysterious God\n                    would not be the God of
  Judeo-\n                    Christianity. But has language gone on a holiday? We
  certainly,\n                    given our religious conditioning, have a \n                        feel-
  ing\n                     that we understand what we are saying here. But do we?
  Perhaps, as\n                    Axel Hägerström thought, “contin- gent thing,”
  “finite\n                    thing,” and “finite reality” are\n                    pleonastic.
  For anything at all that exists, we seem to be able to ask,\n                    without
  being linguistically or con-\n                    ceptually deviant, why it exists.
  “The world” or\n                    “the cosmos” does not stand for an entity or
  a class of things, but is an umbrella term for all\n                    those things
  and their structural relations that religious people call\n                    “finite
  things” and many others just call\n                    “things.” What are we talking
  about when we say there\n                    is something infinite and utterly different
  from these “finite\n                    realities” and that this “utterly other\n
  \                   reality” is neither physical nor temporal nor purely conceptual\n
  \                   nor simply imagi- nary, but, while being\n                    unique
  and radically distinct from all these things, continuously sustains\n                    all
  these “finite things” and is a mysterious\n                    something upon which
  they are utterly dependent? Surely this is very\n                    odd talk and
  “sustains” and\n                    “dependent” have no un-\n                        problematical
  use in this context.These difficulties and a host of difficulties like them\n                     make
  it doubtful whether the discourse used to spell out the\n                    reference
  range of “God” is sufficiently intelli- gible to make such God-talk\n                    coherent.
  An agnostic of the contemporary sort is a man who suspends judg- ment, oscillating
  between rejecting\n                    God-talk as an irrational form of discourse
  containing at crucial junc- tures incoherent or rationally\n                    unjustifiable
  putative truth-claims and accepting this discourse as\n                    something
  which, obscure as it is, makes a sufficiently intelligible\n                    and
  humanly important reference to be worthy of belief.One reading of the situation
  is that the network of fundamental concepts\n                    constitutive of
  nonanthropo- morphic\n                    God-talk in Judeo-Christianity is so problem-\n
  \                       atical that the most reasonable thing to do is to opt for\n
  \                   atheism, particularly when we realize that we do not need these
  religions\n                    or any religion to make sense of our lives or to
  buttress morality. But\n                    agnosticism, particularly of the contemporary
  kind specified here,\n                    need not be an evasion and perhaps is
  the most reason- able alternative for the individual who wishes, concern- ing an
  appraisal of competing world\n                    views and ways of life, to operate
  on a principle of maximum caution.Two extensive discussions are in Robert Flint,
  Agnosticism (London, 1903); and in R. A. Armstrong, Agnosticism and Theism in the
  Nineteenth Century\n                        (London, 1905). See also James Ward,
  Naturalism and\n                            Agnosticism (London, 1899). The central
  works from Hume and\n                        Kant relevant here are David Hume,
