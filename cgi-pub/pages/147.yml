  The Politics of History Teaching in England and France during the 1980s

        Many British historians and educationists have examined the rise of the ‘new’ history in English schools in the 1960s and 1970s, and the debates and criticisms this provoked in the 1980s.1  The introduction of the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) in 1986, and the moves towards the National Curriculum at the end of the decade, spurred the thorough politicization of the aims, content and methodology of school history. Yet British historians have thus far neglected to remark upon a near-identical, near-simultaneous debate in France, where politicians and the press were equally concerned that school history was no longer passing on a unifying sense of national identity to pupils. I therefore intend in this article to go beyond strictly insular descriptions of the school history debates in England. Instead, I shall juxtapose the processes of reform in 1980s England and France to explain why the ‘traditionalist’ reaction in France, carried out by the Ministère de l’Education nationale (MEN) under Education Ministers Alain Savary, Jean-Pierre Chevènement, René Monory and Lionel Jospin, was so successful, while reform in England was accompanied by profound conflict and difficult negotiations. In doing so I shall use the school history debates as a means of treating wider themes in the recent history of England and France: the perceived relationship between school history and national identity, and the respective roles of government, bureaucracy, academic historians and the teaching profession in maintaining or challenging this perception.

- "      I have chosen to compare England, rather than Great Britain, with France,
  despite the fact that ‘British’ identity was more often the object of Conservative
  rhetoric in the 1980s. The National Curriculum, promulgated by the 1988 Education
  Reform Act to come into force in 1991, applied only to England and Wales. Furthermore,
  in an official recognition of the historical and cultural differences between England
  and Wales, separate committees – the History Working Group (HWG) in England, and
  the National Curriculum History Committee for Wales (HCW) – were appointed to devise
  distinct history curricula. Any unitary treatment of school history in Great Britain
  in this period would therefore be misleading and inaccurate. Though Wales had its
  own healthy debate in the run-up to its first official history curriculum of the
  twentieth century, only the English ‘great history debate’, by its intensity and
  publicity, was comparable to that which took place in 1980s France.2  [End Page

  England: the Party Politics of History Teaching?
- |2+

- "\tThe 1980s school history debates in England were inspired by fears that ‘new’
  history had in the two preceding decades superseded ‘traditional’ history in schools,
  thereby threatening the transmission of a strong sense of national identity to children.
  The fact that these fears were widely associated with the Conservative Party, and
  in particular the Thatcherite ‘new right’, meant that the school history debates
  became inextricably linked with the two dominant political parties.\n"
- "      \n"
- |2+

- "\t‘New’ history, which from the 1960s gained widespread support among teachers
  and within the Department for Education and Science (DES), including Her Majesty’s
  Inspectorate (HMI), was based on teachers’ and educationists’ concerns that ‘traditional’
  history – chronological, anglocentric and narrative-based – merely taught pupils
  to memorize rather than to think. ‘New’ history involved a range of fresh approaches;
  more recent history, more non-British history, and ‘history from below’ replaced
  the emphasis on national high politics and battles. Research into children’s learning
  methods, notably that of Jean Piaget, had translated into history teaching as claims
  that that children and even adolescents had only a ‘patchy’ grasp of temporal continuity,
  rendering it ‘entirely unrealistic’ to teach history chronologically.3  In-depth
  studies of particular historical moments were considered more appropriate. The centrality
  of rote learning was replaced by an emphasis on the skills of using and interpreting
  historical sources. Finally, the viewpoint of the elite male Englishman no longer
  dominated. A high value was placed on the ability to view historical events from
  the perspectives of their various participants or contemporary observers – the ‘empathy’
  that would become so controversial in the 1980s.\n"
- "      \n"
- |2+

- "\tThe evidence indicates that many history teachers were receptive to this renovation
  of their subject. According to Raphael Samuel the Institutes of Education, founded
  in the 1960s, constituted a key site for the transmission to up-and-coming teachers
  of ‘new’ history’s aims and methods.4  As early as 1967 the Central Advisory Council
  for Education reported that while content and quality of teaching varied enormously
  in English schools, ‘child-centred’ methods had become widespread:\n"
- "      \n"
- |2+

- "\t  the dreary notes copied from the blackboard have largely disappeared and children
  are at least given the opportunity to make their own summaries in which emphasis
  may quite rightly be very different from that of adult historians. . . . History
  frequently provides a successful starting point for spontaneous drama, for narrative
  of the ‘I was there’ kind and for lively art and craft.5 \n"

- "\t‘New’ history also made inroads in secondary teaching. By the end of the 1980s,
  over one-third of secondary schools were using the Schools  [End Page 201] \n"

- "\tHistory Project (SHP) syllabus, which constituted ‘new’ history’s most innovative
  – and to traditionalists its most ignominious – incarnation.6  Created in 1972 by
  the Schools Council, the Project contained units on ‘What is History?’ and ‘History
  Around Us’, and, as the Project’s official evaluator Denis Shemilt wrote, encouraged
  pupils to consider ‘the reality of different sorts of evidence’ and ‘the problems
  of reconstruction in the face of biased, incomplete and contradictory evidence’
  (Shemilt’s emphasis). The in-depth ‘patch’ study of one historical moment was the
  dominant method; the only concession to a long-span chronological approach was the
  ‘Study in Development’, for which History of Medicine was the only course on offer
  in 1980, although the option of ‘Energy through Time’ was later added. ‘Although
  frequently erroneous’, wrote Shemilt, ‘the ideas of History 13–16 students tend
  to be lively and colourful. If not always valid and consistent, their reasoning
  is usually elaborate and ingenious.’7  Educationists’ enthusiasm is well conveyed
  in the 1986 claim by Batho, Booth and Brown that the Project\n"

- |2+

- "\t  has done more than any other single agency to promote historical learning among
  secondary school pupils . . . more emphasis has been placed on the encouragement
  of the development of historical skills such as the understanding of concepts, the
  detection of bias and the exercise of imaginative insights.8 \n"
- |2+

- "\tIf the SHP course remained confined to a significant minority of secondary schools,
  the broader influence of ‘new’ history was palpable in the new GCSE history courses
  introduced in 1986. SHP was the only syllabus accepted unaltered at GCSE level,
  while its philosophy was inherent in the other syllabuses on offer. No common body
  of knowledge was prescribed for GCSE pupils; rather, the authors of the GCSE National
  Criteria for History wrote that ‘coherence is provided by the emphasis in all parts
  of the syllabus on the nature and use of evidence’.9 \n"

- "\tHow did politicians react to the apparent death of traditional, chronological,
  anglocentric school history? The Labour opposition, as might be expected, welcomed
  the eradication of tired jingoism, the reduced concentration on England, and the
  penetration of ‘history from below’ into classrooms. ‘New’ history seemed to indicate
  a certain harmonization between school history and the work of dominant left-wing
  historians like Eric Hobsbawm and Christopher Hill. Conservative opinions, however,
  ranged from caution to disgust. Keith Joseph, Education Minister from 1981 to 1986,
  was sympathetic to methodological innovation and supported children’s use of primary
  source material, their appreciation of history’s selective nature and the use of
  ‘their reason as well as their memories’. Yet he remained attached to the ‘traditional’
  story of the growth of British liberty, believing that history should contribute
  to pupils’  [End Page 203] national pride. In 1984 he told the Historical Association

- "\tFears of teachers and of political indoctrination of pupils were prominent in
  the new right’s condemnation of ‘new’ history. Surely one had only to look at the
  William Tyndale ‘affair’ of 1974–6 to see the nefarious effects of a radicalized
  teaching corps on England’s children; in this north London primary school experiments
  with progressive methods had led to what the Inspectorate called an ‘atmosphere
  of chaotic violence’.12  To Thatcher, then, teachers had become little more than
  the ‘Friendly Red Army’ teaching the ‘Shop Steward Syllabus’.13  At the beginning
  of the 1980s, however, the Tories were in no position to act on this belief. England’s
  long tradition of decentralization left the government with very limited influence
  over the curriculum. The abrogation of payment by results in the 1890s had effectively
  ended central prescription; the 1944 Butler Act required no more than religious
  instruction in schools. When the Schools Council for Curriculum and Examinations
  was established in 1964, it was agreed that teachers would have a majority on all
  important committees. Teachers were therefore both providers of course suggestions
  and materials to their colleagues through the Schools Council, and largely responsible
  for selecting from amongst these materials.14  Furthermore, they were appointed
  and paid by Local Education  [End Page 204] Authorities (LEAs), many of which, complained
  the government, were themselves controlled by the ‘loony left’.15 \n"
- |2+

- "\tThe principle of non-intervention by the central state in the curriculum first
  appeared to be threatened in the early 1980s. The abolition of the Schools Council
  under Keith Joseph led to dire predictions that the Secretary of State would take
  control, predictions which particularly alarmed history teachers and many academics.
  As Christopher Hill declared when the first rumours of a national curriculum were
  heard, ‘everything in the British democratic tradition has been against allowing
  the state to dictate what history we shall study’.16  For the moment, however, that
  tradition seemed secure. For the rest of the decade, decisions regarding what should
  be taught continued to be made at regional (exam board), local (LEA), school (head
  teacher and department) and individual (classroom teacher) levels.\n"
- "      \n"
- |2+

- "\tFurthermore, any official, new right vision of history was hindered not only
  by the political opposition and a fiercely independent teaching corps, but also
  by the DES and HMI. Fundamentally, the DES remained supportive of the newer methods.
  Its 1985 publication History in the Primary and Secondary Years: an HMI View noted
  that classes ‘dominated by the need to acquire and remember content’ were outdated
  and that factual recall was ‘likely to be less dominant’ in future examinations.
  Support was given instead to children’s cultivation of ‘historical empathy’.17  Perhaps
  because Labour’s support for ‘history from below’ was seen as inevitable, the DES
  therefore attracted more Tory vitriol. ‘You have an awful department’, Thatcher
  told Joseph in 1983. Kenneth Baker, Joseph’s successor as Education Minister, was
  clearly in agreement. He recorded in his memoirs that:\n"
- "      \n"
- |2+

- "\t  Of all Whitehall Departments, the DES was among those with the strongest in-house
  ideology. . . . It was rooted in ‘progressive’ orthodoxies, in egalitarianism and
  in the comprehensive school system. . . . Not only was the Department in league
  with the teacher unions, University Departments of Education, teacher-training theories,
  and local authorities, it also acted as their protector against any threats which
  Ministers might pose. If the civil servants were the guardians of this culture,
  then Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Education were its priesthood.\n"
- "\t\n"
- |2+

- "\tBaker recalled how representatives of the teachers’ unions came to the DES ‘almost
  daily’, and how this mutual back-scratching, which rendered Tory reforms so difficult,
  was ‘all part and parcel of the culture of the education establishment which had
  reigned since the 1960s’.18  Yet with the devolution of power to the local level
  so deeply entrenched in British traditions of governance in education, and with
  the curriculum at each school depending on the outcome of selection at a number
  of different levels, the personal opinion of the Secretary of State was largely
  symbolic. As Denis Lawton  [End Page 205] and Stephen Ball have emphasized, this
  structure left the government little room for manoeuvre when lacking the support
  of the Department and teachers’ unions.19 \n"
- |2+

- "\tIn summary, the English education system of the 1980s was largely decentralized,
  resisted central interference in the name of teacher autonomy and expertise, and
  provided an extremely varied history education in terms both of subjects studied
  and of teaching quality. The central government was absent from the curriculum elaboration
  process, meaning that the new right’s contempt for the so-called establishment’s
  orthodoxies – which included the ‘new’ history – was condemned to have little real
  effect on classroom practice. Thus the years 1986 to 1991 become crucial, for in
  this space between the introduction of the GCSE and that of the National Curriculum,
  the Conservative government put its foot down, and set in motion the reform which
  would bring the curriculum – and, it was hoped, teachers – under central control
  for the first time in the twentieth century.\n"

- "\tA look across the Channel reveals that the battle between ‘new’ and ‘traditional’
  history was by no means a uniquely British phenomenon. When in 1983 Lord Hugh Thomas,
  historian-advisor to Prime Minister Thatcher, praised the patriotic tenor of history
  in French schools and regretted that school history in England was failing to achieve
  the same end, he was clearly unaware that similar moves away from national(ist)
  school history had also taken place in France since the 1960s.21  Both research
  based on Piagetian theory and the Annales historians’ rejection of histoire événementielle
  had called into question the traditional teaching method of dictating ‘facts’ considered
  central to the national story. This French parallel to British ‘new’ history in
  schools – also often termed la nouvelle histoire – was spearheaded in the 1960s
  and 1970s by journals, notably Cahiers pédagogiques and Enseignement 70; by institutions
  such as the National Institute of Pedagogical Research and Documentation (Institut
  national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique, INRDP); and by engaged individuals
  such as Suzanne Citron, at the time a teacher, Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general
  of teacher training, and Louis François, Dean of the History/Geography group within
  the Inspectorate of National Education. Leif maintained that children should learn
  about historians’ approaches as well as facts, while François declared that teachers
  should provide historic documents and promote ‘active methods’ which would give
  pupils ‘the immense happiness of discovery’.22  With the Inspectorate and INRDP
  falling under the aegis of the Ministry, it is clear that, Lord Thomas’s claims
  notwithstanding, progressive methods had gained significant support within the French
  educational establishment.\n"

- "\tIn primary schools history was abolished in 1969 as an independent subject, and
  rather vaguely classified as an ‘awakening activity’  [End Page 206] (activité d’éveil)
  within the social sciences. Yet the attempt of Giscard d’Estaing’s Education Minister,
  René Haby, to extend this integrated, thematic approach to the collège (junior high
  school; pupils aged about eleven to fifteen) in 1977 provoked violent reactions
  against the entire philosophie d’éveil which had apparently captured the Inspectorate
  and INRDP. The content and methods of the ‘new’ school history were attacked not
  only by historians but also in the National Assembly and Senate, in the press and
  by prominent public figures in the media and intellectual life.\n"

  rhetoric, denouncing children’s ‘ignorance of their origins’ and of heroes of the
  national past as ‘the worst of all solitudes’, was remarkably akin to that employed
  by the French left. Nor were the politicians of the right easily distinguished in

- "\t  Beullac himself appeared resigned to modifying Haby’s reform. ‘Well aware’,
  he said, that many primary schools no longer taught French history,  [End Page 207]
  he requested time to act.25  Thus with the Communists at one extreme and the far-right
  think tank Le Club de l’Horloge at the other in accord on the necessity of a return
  to chronological national history in schools, there was a clear political consensus.\n"
- "\t\n"
- |2+

- "\t  When, in 1980, history professor Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie concluded that ‘concern
  for collective memory is neither revolutionary nor reactionary’, he tapped into
  one of the key reasons for the striking discrepancy between the French and English
  reactions to the ascendancy of ‘new’ history.26  When compulsory and secular primary
  schooling was introduced to France by the Ferry laws in 1881–2, its chief objective,
  to borrow Eugen Weber’s terms, was to turn ‘peasants into Frenchmen’, transforming
  the culturally and linguistically diverse populations of the provinces into a homogenous,
  unified nation.27  Labelled the hussards noirs de la République, primary-school
  teachers were at the forefront of this mission, and French language and history
  were the two chief weapons in their nation-building armoury. A glorious account
  of past heroes and of the consolidation of French territory since the time of ‘our
  ancestors, the Gauls’ would both induct children into the ‘imagined community’ of
  the nation and, crucially, leave them determined to recapture for France the ‘lost
  provinces’ of Alsace and Lorraine.\n"
- "\t\n"
- |2+

- "\t  For France’s dominant political parties of the 1980s, all of which were resolutely
  republican, school history’s pivotal role in the consolidation of the republican
  nation-state endowed the history curriculum with enduring symbolic as well as practical
  importance. If national history was necessary to unify the nation, then, logically,
  the failure to teach it meant the death of national identity. When President Mitterrand’s
  Minister of Education, Alain Savary, commissioned history professor René Girault
  to report on the state of history teaching in French schools, the results, submitted
  in 1983, seemed to justify the prevailing sense of crisis. History in primary schools,
  if taught at all, was ‘disjointed’ and lacked ‘chronological coherence’. And politicians
  were alarmed to learn that when 2,600 pupils in their first year of collège were
  surveyed, most could not say when the French Revolution had begun, while many believed
  that d’Artagnan was a more important figure than Mirabeau, and Richelieu more important
  than Robespierre, during the Revolution.28  Mitterrand declared to his Council of
  Ministers on 31 August 1983 – in the process providing the next day’s headlines
  – that he was ‘scandalized and anguished by the loss of collective memory’ in French
  youth, and that reform was clearly necessary.29 \n"
- |2+

- "\t  For Mitterrand’s France seemed fragmented in new ways. It became clear in the
  1980s that many of the visibly different immigrants who had arrived during the ‘thirty
  glorious years’ of economic boom after the Second World War had no intention of
  going ‘home’. With citizenship acquisition simple for the second generation (requiring
  only five years’ residence and a clean criminal record upon attaining the age of
  majority), and automatic for the third under the double droit du sol, the ‘strategy
  of memory’, enacted  [End Page 208] a century earlier by the Third Republic to unify
  the French population, was seen to have as much practical importance as ever. A
  solid knowledge of national history, it was thought, was crucial to the transformation
  of immigrants and their children into fully integrated French citizens.\n"
- "\t\n"
- |2+

- "\t  This historicization of schooling, and of history teaching in particular, accounts
  for the widespread attachment among otherwise differing French politicians to traditional
  school history. Concerns that school history was failing to instil a sense of national
  identity in pupils belonged to all, rather than, as in England, to a particular
  political party. It also reveals why French teachers, like politicians, remained
  committed to traditional aims and approaches in the history classroom. The most
  vocal, notably influential professors in prestigious lycées, were largely resistant
  to the ‘new’ history.30  As Nicole Tutiaux-Guillon has written, only a minority
  of teachers believed that pupils ‘had the right to their own history, be it that
  of a town, a region, of migration, or the history of women’, or disagreed with ‘[t]he
  official standpoint . . . that the curriculum must not be modified to accommodate
  pupils’ preferences or local demands’ – a belief widely shared by pupils and their
  parents.31  So when the Savary and Chevènement reforms cemented the return, in 1984–5,
  to the traditional study of the great periods and personages of French national
  history, many teachers welcomed the reforms.32 \n"
- |2+

- "\t  This ideological consensus would have been reinforced by the fact that teachers
  in France throughout their careers retained a direct relationship with the central
  state. Unlike England, where teachers’ appointments and pay were local concerns,
  teachers in France were paid directly by the Ministry, which was also responsible
  for recruiting and qualifying secondary-school teachers through national examination,
  the Certificate of Aptitude in Secondary Teaching (Certificat d’aptitude au professorat
  de l’enseignement du second degré, CAPES) or the more prestigious agrégation. The
  Ministry had also been responsible for the curriculum since the 1880s. Égalité in
  education required that pupils throughout the country had access to the same knowledge,
  and this was best be achieved by the application, across all the French provinces,
  of a single curriculum determined in Paris. There could be no greater contrast with
  the principle of central nonintervention predominant in England until the mid 1980s.\n"

  The Mid 1980s: Confirmation of British Division and French Consensus
- |2+

- "\t  This principle, however, would not last out the decade. In 1988, the Education
  Reform Act confirmed the advent of the National Curriculum. For the new right, this
  offered an opportunity to combat the supposed dominance of the ideologically-tainted
  ‘new’ history in English schools, which they perceived to have been confirmed by
  the first GCSE examinations of the same year. The history examinations provoked
  some appalled Conservative reactions in the House of Commons. In October,  [End
  Page 209] Nicholas Bennett, Conservative MP for Pembroke and former history teacher,
  roundly attacked GCSE empathy as ‘nothing but historical fiction’. Worse, in the
  hands of biased teachers, GCSE was a dangerous means of political indoctrination.
  Bennett quoted a number of examples, including a trial paper’s ‘outrageous’ demand
  that pupils\n"

- "\t  \n"

- "\t  Bennett’s claims echoed a comment made by political economist Robert Skidelsky’s
  earlier that year that empathy was a spectacularly one-sided exercise, with pupils
  asked to imagine themselves suffragettes, Jews in Hitler’s Germany or Palestinians,
  but ‘I have yet to see a sample question inviting Hitler or Mussolini to justify
  his policies’.33  Angela Rumbold, Minister of State for Education and also a former
  history teacher, agreed that Bennett had ‘graphically illustrated’ some of the GCSE’s
  problems, and added her own fear ‘that empathy may squeeze out knowledge and understanding
  rather than reinforce them’.34 \n"

- "\t  Yet the opposition found Tory enthusiasm for a return to more traditional methods
  and content deeply suspect. As early as 1983 Labour MP Jeff Rooker demanded whether
  Joseph recognized that a history core curriculum must include ‘coverage of the period
  when Britain exploited human and material resources in many parts of the world’.
  To which Joseph evasively replied that ‘There is far more good to be said about
  British history than the hon. Gentleman evidently thinks’.35  More provocatively,
  in November 1989 Jack Straw demanded of Rumbold whether National Curriculum history
  would be ‘balanced’, or determined by ‘the Prime Minister and the advisers in the
  No. 10 policy unit who wish to turn the history syllabus into no more than a vehicle
  for the jingoistic, Right-wing indoctrination of our children’.36  Raphael Samuel
  recalled that Straw even came up with his own, equally ‘sectarian’, list of historical
  landmarks, ‘ranging from the Tolpuddle Martyrs to the founding of the Labour Party’,
  and that he sent a letter to academic historians warning that the Conservatives
  were ‘attempting to nobble the new history syllabus for “jingoistic” purposes’.37

- "\t  That it was even conceivable to have two distinct lists of dates and events
  constituting the schoolchild’s ‘Conservative’ or ‘Labour’ history of Britain indicates
  the profoundly different political stakes attached to school history in England
  and France. We have seen the origins of the French belief that national history
  must belong to all if the nation-state was to maintain its unity. In practice this
  translated as a consensual ‘list’ of dates and events which had evolved from its
  incarnation in the ‘Petit Lavisse’ textbook history of France in the early years
  of the Third Republic to that of the 1980s curricula a century later. The belief
  was so strong that even the extremely  [End Page 210] varied historians consulted
  prior to the 1984 reform, who included René Girault, Michelle Perrot, Madeleine
  Rebérioux, Mona Ozouf, René Remond, Antoine Prost, Jean Peyrot, Jean-Noël Luc and
  Jacques Le Goff, were in accord. Meeting at Montpellier in January 1984, the historians
  supported the return to tradition, agreeing that not only should school history
  familiarize students with chronology, it should also focus predominantly on national
  history. As Prost summarized:\n"
- "\t\n"
- |2+

- "\t    We have rediscovered here the great republican tradition of the nineteenth
  and twentieth centuries incarnated by Seignobos . . . it is through history teaching
  that pupils learn how a society – our own – functions, how it evolves and changes.
  . . .We must explain our society, our civilization, our institutions to pupils,
  not because they are better than others, but because it so happens that they are
  our own.38 \n"
- |2+

- "\t  The Montpellier historians’ advice to drop ‘new’ history in schools was consistent
  with that of Fernand Braudel, who, although himself a pioneer of ‘new’ approaches
  in research, had claimed that exposing pupils under seventeen or eighteen to such
  approaches was a ‘primary error’, and of Pierre Goubert, who had denounced the desultory
  study of themes ‘which can be historic or not’, and the focus on local history as
  ‘a perfect aberration’.39  School history and academic research were two distinct
  activities with quite different objectives, and the grey areas which expanded in
  proportion to historiographic reflection were to have no place in the comforting
  black and white of the classroom.\n"
- "\t\n"
- |2+

- "\t  Although the historians’ advice was implemented by Socialist Education Ministers
  Savary and Chevènement, the list of dates and events which primary pupils, in their
  exclusive study of France, were required to memorize had no perceptible skew to
  the left; if Jean Jaurès was one twentieth-century personality with whom young children
  were to be familiar, Charles de Gaulle was the other. Yet the best evidence which
  the French comparison provides that a consensual balance was possible is the fact
  that the centreright education minister René Monory, who succeeded Chevènement in
  1986 at the advent of the Mitterrand-Chirac cohabitation, smoothly continued to
  oversee the implementation of the new programmes in the first two years of the collège.
  In the same way, the return of a Socialist, Lionel Jospin, to the head of the Ministry

  1989.\n"

  the falsity of the somewhat instinctive assumption that, in the context of a modern,
  multi-ethnic western democracy, chronological national history in schools was inherently
  right-wing. What appeared a profoundly Tory project in England was accomplished
  by  [End Page 211] the Socialists in France, with politicians from the Gaullists

  School History and National Cohesion

- "\t  Yet was the ‘traditionalist’ solution favoured by the French and the British
  new right viable in England? Had the British been paying attention to the French
  reforms (and there is very little indication they were), the method favoured by
  the French to instil a strong sense of national identity in the young could well
  have appeared questionable. How could a curriculum that focused almost exclusively
  on white male heroes of the metropole, Catholic, or at least (after the Revolution)
  of Catholic background, engage the many French children whose families originated
  from the Muslim Maghreb, from sub-Saharan Africa, Indochina or the West Indies?
  How could a curriculum that gave them no place in French history make them feel
  more French?\n"
- "\t\n"
- |2+

- "\t  The answer lies in an understanding of the differences between French and British
  definitions of citizenship, and, closely related, their respective ideal ‘models’
  of immigrant integration into the national community. As Adrian Favell noted in
  Philosophies of Integration, in France the meaning of ‘Republican citizenship’ had
  become a matter of political consensus. Both left and right accepted ‘the classic
  civic idea of France put together during [the Third Republic] – of France as a universal
  nation of equal and free citizens’. Within the public sphere, there was no official
  recognition of ethnic or cultural groups which would divert the individual’s loyalty
  from the sole group which counted – the nation.40  While immigrant families were
  free within reason to practise their particular religion or culture in the home,
  in the public school, the institution charged with the creation of French citizens,
  any celebration of difference would highlight and entrench these children’s ‘otherness’
  and therefore undermine their integration. Instead, they were encouraged to appropriate
  the history of the French metropole as their own, entirely disregarding something
  so theoretically unimportant as their skin colour, or the religion they practised
  in the completely separate private sphere.41 \n"
- |2+

- "\t  Nor should it be forgotten that many of these pupils came from colonies which
  had been integrated into France in a way that never occurred in the British Empire.
  Algeria had been officially a part of France for 114 years before independence in
  1962; as far as the French government was concerned, those born in Algeria before
  1962 were French nationals, and those who crossed the Mediterranean in the post-war
  years in many cases merely moved from one French département to another. Their French-born
  ‘Beur’ children acquired automatic citizenship, unhampered by the double droit du
  sol that applied to those who were more clearly ‘immigrants’. In a similar way,
  under the 1946 Constitution of the Fourth Republic France retained Martinique, Guadeloupe,
  French Guiana and Réunion as ‘overseas departments’ (départements d’outre-mer) which
  formed an integral part of  [End Page 212] France as surely as the departments of
  Paris or the Vendée. The distinction metropole/colony, quite easily applied in the
  British context, was therefore less certain in the French. As one country with one
  people – an ideal reflected by the absence of any ethnic classification in French
  censuses – the French had one history, a history that had already in the nineteenth
  century proven its potential to unify those of different cultures and languages.\n"
- "\t\n"
- |2+

- "\t  The French relegation of particularism to the private sphere in the name of
  national unity carried with it a certain disdain for the British (or ‘Anglo-Saxon’,
  as it was more often termed) conception of the integrated immigrant-turned-citizen.
  Like the French Socialists of the 1980s, Thatcher’s government was well aware of
  running a culturally and ethnically diverse nation; unlike the French, however,
  British governments since the 1970s had embraced, albeit with varying degrees of
  warmth, an official policy of multiculturalism. While state recognition, even celebration,
  of such variety in public as well as private life seemed to the French a key cause
  of that most frightening fragmenting force, communautarisme; to the British, the
  French method often appeared ‘crudely assimilationist’ and intolerant. Abiding by
  the law was the chief obligation of immigrants in Britain, even if truly ‘fitting
  in’ was best proven by involvement in their local communities. Nor was it necessarily
  expected that they abandon a sense of loyalty to, or identification with, their
  country of origin; Norman Tebbit’s ‘cricket test’ confirmed this in the very ridicule
  it incited.\n"
- "\t\n"
- |2+

- "\t  Behind the disputes as to the respective merits of the content and skills-based
  approaches, the school history debates were therefore profoundly concerned with
  the place of diversity in the national imaginary. Post-war immigration had led in
  Britain to an official recognition of communities which cherished multiple identities
  and loyalties. This recognition was reflected in ‘new’ history’s attempt to give
  minorities a historical voice. Through study of the perspectives of the many sorts
  of ‘other’ – the colonized, slaves, immigrants, women, workers and the poor – their
  contribution to history was recognized, while the presence of former colonial peoples
  in Britain was explained, justified and, ideally, valued. In summary, ‘new’ history
  was a natural ally of pluralism. It was rejected by the French, predominantly opposed
  to the official recognition of ethnic communities in accordance with Republican
  tradition, just as it was rejected by those elements of the British right which
  saw ‘native’ culture as threatened by immigration and pluralism. Yet in England,
  with its self-proclaimed multiculturalism, any return to the sort of school history
  which belonged to a pre-multicultural era was impossible, smacking as it did of
  nostalgia and racism.\n"
- "\t\n"
- |2+

- "\t  These very different methods of relating school history to national identity
  were reflected in the vocabularies which dominated the school history debates in
  the two countries. The concept of memory and its relation to history was absolutely
  central to the French discourse, which held the  [End Page 213] inculcation of a
  common ‘memory’ of the past to be the best means of uniting those with extremely
  disparate ethno-cultural backgrounds into an homogenous citizenry. Reflecting the
  sense of identity crisis so eloquently described by Pierre Nora, the ministerial
  documents of the 1980s were chiefly remarkable for their explicit association of
  school history, memory and national identity.42  Girault’s assertion in his report
  that ‘history assures the safekeeping of collective memory’ was in keeping with
  the dominant political discourse; Mitterrand had in 1983 justified his demand for
  reform with the claim that ‘a people which loses its memory loses its identity’,
  while Prime Minister Mauroy announced at Montpellier in January 1984 that the main
  cause for studying history was the ‘search for an identity’.43  Terms such as ‘collective
  memory’ and ‘national identity’ were therefore repeatedly employed in the 1980s
  history curricula. By emphasizing that France was ‘a society forged by a common
  history’, the government hoped to restore the ‘roots and depth’ to a national identity
  in crisis.44 \n"
- |2+

- "\t  By contrast, if teachers of the ‘new’ history in England respected memory as
  the source of competing interpretations of history, it was certainly not something
  that could be instilled at school. Conversely, the concept of ‘empathy’ never even
  entered the French debate. With the acquisition of facts and knowledge as the primary
  goal, French pupils were to be correct and not imaginative; Shemilt’s enthusiasm
  for the highly creative but entirely wrong answers provided by some of the SHP pupils
  found no equivalent in 1980s France. Furthermore, if empathy might have made English
  children better citizens, encouraging them to respect the unfamiliar, the ‘other’
  who was perhaps sitting at the neighbouring desk, there was no equivalent need for
  this in France, where in school, as in public life, there was no recognized ‘other’.\n"

  Towards the 1990s
- |2+

- "\t  As the decade came to an end, the ‘traditionalist’ restoration was successfully
  completed in France. The primary curriculum, finalized under Chevènement in 1985,
  required children to memorize a careful selection of dates, events and personalities,
  from Vercingétorix to de Gaulle, derived from a fundamentally celebratory story
  of the national past. The nineteenth-century module, for instance, was centred on
  ‘France, great colonial and world power’, the twentieth-century one on ‘France,
  great technological and cultural power’.45  Pupils would also spend the third (the
  quatrième) and fifth (the classe de seconde) of their senior years of history focusing
  exclusively on France. Confirming the return to a more celebratory narrative, the
  Ministry recommended in the 1988 programme for the quatrième that ‘French power’
  be the unifying theme for the study of the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries.
  With the focus on the works of Richelieu, Mazarin, Louis XIV and Napoleon, on France’s
  ‘imperial vocation’ and ‘cultural radiance’, the story was one of progress and the
  doings of ‘great men’. Teachers were to avoid the ‘debates and polemics’ provoked
  by the  [End Page 214] approaching Bicentenary of the Revolution; similarly they
  were to refrain from either praising or condemning the imperial project.46  The
  French government thereby confirmed the expulsion of ‘new’ history, with its interest
  in the historian’s role in shaping the presentation of the past, in favour of a
  more traditional belief in the possibility of a single historical narrative which
  could be both correct and inspiring.\n"
- "\t\n"
- |2+

- "\t  By 1989, when the final stage of the French reform came into force, the English
  debate was reaching its climax. By that point new right pressure groups such as
  the Hillgate Group, the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), a think-tank founded by
  Thatcher and Joseph in 1974, the History Curriculum Association (HCA) and the Campaign
  for Real Education (CRE) had been crusading for several years against ‘new’ school
  history, which, they claimed, had abandoned the true aims and content of the subject.
  Their primary objective was to restore, à la française, a chronological national
  history to the centre of the curriculum. All were agreed that ‘knowledge of a shared
  past, of a national tradition’ – to borrow the terms of Skidelsky, himself an HCA
  member – needed to replace the highly politicized, leftist history that privileged
  ‘multicultural’ perspectives, and held the cultivation of empathy and generic skills
  to be more important than the solid acquisition of ‘facts’.47 \n"
- |2+

- "\t  When Baker put together the History Working Group to elaborate the National
  Curriculum for history, his choices alarmed the more extreme traditionalists, including
  Thatcher.48  HWG member Alice Prochaska observed that the group was ‘shrewdly chosen’
  to represent the variety of opinions; she herself had, in an interview prior to
  her appointment to the HWG, ‘disagreed with most of the propositions put to me by
  Kenneth Baker and Angela Rumbold’ and ‘enquired rather worriedly about the amount
  of prescription that was intended’.49  Baker’s respect for those who did not share
  his traditionalist leanings subsequently led Thatcher to conclude that the entire
  process had been corrupted because ‘Ken Baker paid too much attention to the DES,
  the HMI and progressive educational theorists in his appointments and early decisions’.50
  \ While the HWG’s terms of reference insisted upon a common core of British history,
  they also recognized that Britain had been ‘influenced by ideas, movements and events
  elsewhere in the world’, required that opposing views of history be presented to
  students, and prohibited political indoctrination.51 \n"
- |2+

- "\t  As the HWG worked its way towards the interim then final reports, academic
  historians remained divided as to the respective merits of the ‘traditional’ and
  the ‘new’ school history. Some echoed David Cannadine’s assertion that ‘[t]he new
  GCSE syllabus means that even those schools which teach the subject seriously and
  well will now impart much less of a historical education’.52  Oxford modern history
  professor Norman Stone, for example, agreed with Cannadine that instead of mirroring
  academic trends by sacrificing breadth for depth, schools needed to get back to
  ‘the basic elements of the national past’.53  Jonathan Clark’s defence  [End Page
  215] of national history was particularly pertinent in its assertion that, while
  narrative should dominate school history rather than questions of interpretation,
  the result would not be a generation of brainwashed Conservatives:\n"
- "\t\n"
- |2+

- "\t    Voices as diverse as Gareth Stedman Jones and the new Minister of Education,
  John MacGregor, have called for more British history on a chronological framework.
  Does this have an inbuilt bias to the Right? It is hard to see why it should.54
  \n"
- |2+

- "\t  Had Clark looked to the contemporary situation in France, he would have found
  ample evidence for his claim that the left was just as capable of producing a national,
  even patriotic, narrative.\n"
- "\t\n"
- |2+

- "\t  Defending ‘new’ history were the chiefly left-wing historians engaged in writing
  ‘history from below’. The History Workshop’s first conference on ‘History, the Nation
  and the Schools’ at Ruskin College, Oxford, gave these historians an opportunity
  to face their traditionalist protagonists in June 1989, just over two months before
  the Interim Report was published on 10 August. In a line-up that pitted Stewart
  Deuchar, whom history educationist Robert Phillips labelled ‘the Mary Whitehouse
  of the history world’, and historian Ralph Davis at one extreme against the history
  teachers and educationists Sallie Purkis and John Fines at the other, ‘the new historians
  won easily’ – though it admittedly helped, recalled Roger West in his review of
  the day, that they were ‘playing on home ground to their supporters’.55  Raphael
  Samuel attempted to mediate, reflecting that the traditionalists’ contribution ‘reminds
  us that history is important for what it is about, not merely a means to an end’,
  while the ‘new’ historians’ interest in multiculturalism was, Samuel reassured the
  said traditionalists, a way ‘to remake national history, not to discard it’.56  Yet
  he was unable to dispel the strong impression, not unlike that prevailing in Parliament,
  of two enemy camps with little common ground.\n"
- "\t\n"
- |2+

- "\t  When the HWG’s Final Report was published on 3 April 1990, it was clear that
  a determined attempt had been made to reconcile the best of the ‘traditional’ and
  the ‘new’ approaches to school history. Despite the heterogeneity of the British
  population, ‘yet much is shared in common’; it was history’s role to reveal this
  common identity.57  British history therefore comprised over fifty per cent of the
  course content, in accordance with the instructions of the new Secretary of State,
  John MacGregor. However, the authors roundly rejected a ‘Little England’ approach,
  and emphasized the cultural, religious, linguistic and other differences existing
  between and within England, Wales and Scotland, as well as the multiple ‘inheritances’
  (a term which the authors favoured over ‘heritage’, with its false implications
  of cultural or even racial homogeneity) which successive waves of immigration which
  had brought to Britain over the centuries.\n"
- "\t\n"
- |2+

- "\t  ‘New’ history was represented in three key ways. Firstly, the HWG recognized
  the SHP and the GCSE for their role in bringing ‘historical  [End Page 216] methodology’
  and investigation of ‘the nature of history’ to pupils. Secondly, the wide choice
  of non-core units and provisions for school-designed units allowed teachers to alternate
  units on local, European and world history with the compulsory British units. Thirdly,
  the HWG resisted traditionalists’ demands for a French-style list of historical
  facts in the attainment targets. There was unanimous agreement that ‘no set of historical
  facts could be drawn up for testing purposes that did not imply a particular interpretation’.58
  \ They also refused to be drawn into the debate over empathy, which they saw as
  positing a false divide between factual knowledge and skills.\n"
- "\t\n"
- |2+

- "\t  Despite inevitable criticisms from both right and left, by the time of the
  History Workshop’s second ‘History, the Nation and the Schools’ Ruskin conference,
  in 1990, Raphael Samuel was able to comment that the report had been ‘widely endorsed’.
  Primary-school teacher and HWG member Robert Guyver also remarked that while teachers
  remained worried that their creative capacity would be curbed by prescribed topics,
  there was nevertheless ‘overwhelming support for the ideas enshrined in the attainment
  targets’ and ‘wide approval’ for the HWG’s refusal to pander to extremists by separating
  knowledge from skills.59  The teachers’ verdict on the Final Report was therefore
  largely favourable. Despite the move towards central prescription, Samuel expressed
  his confidence that ‘new’ history would maintain its status when placed in the hands
  of a teaching profession which regarded ‘the idea of an anglocentric history . .
  . with universal derision’.60  Thus Conservative MP John Stokes’s subsequent plea
  for a restored ‘romance’ of the British Empire and a celebration of ‘the glorious
  deeds of our past’ and ‘our wonderful heritage of cathedrals, churches, castles
  and country houses’ was clearly no more than the swan song of ‘traditional’ British
  history.61 \n"

  Conclusion
- |2+

- "\t  The 1980s questioning of ‘new’ history, which had penetrated many French and
  English history classrooms in the 1960s and 1970s, was the result of near-identical
  concerns in the two countries. Critics feared that children were ignorant of national
  history, declared that the absence of a chronological framework was absurd and believed
  that study of the nature of historical evidence was the proper activity of historians,
  not schoolchildren. Yet profound differences between the two societies led to near-opposite
  outcomes. The rapid politicization of school history in France, in particular from
  1979, led to an almost universal recognition that the attempt to teach schoolchildren
  ‘new’ history was a mistake; politicians of all parties, bureaucrats, intellectuals,
  teachers and the public rallied to traditionalism in what Jacques Le Goff termed
  a ‘union sacrée’.62  The historical role played by schools and the history curriculum
  in building a nation of citizens continued to inspire loyalty across the political
  spectrum, especially because, after the rapid demographic and economic changes of
  the now-finished  [End Page 217] trente glorieuses (the post-war ‘glorious thirty
  years’) French identity and unity seemed threatened once more. The reform was therefore
  driven by a republican commitment to homogeneity, blind to ethnic or cultural variation,
  within the public sphere, and by a belief, common to both sides of politics and
  based on the experience of the Third Republic, that a rather celebratory view of
  the national past would reinforce national cohesion.\n"
- "\t\n"
- |2+

- "\t  This conception of schooling and national identity went hand-in-hand with a
  tradition of political centralization which rendered the actual implementation of
  the reform simply ‘business as usual’. Central prescription of the curriculum had
  begun with mass schooling a century before; well-habituated, teachers in France
  were confident that this did not prevent creativity or individuality in their work.
  By contrast, England had an equally well-entrenched tradition of local government
  in a wide range of areas. Education was a local responsibility in England just as
  surely as it was a central concern in France. There had been no direct central control
  over the primary curriculum in England for close to a century – while mass secondary
  schooling, with its shorter history, had never had a centrally-determined curriculum.
  It was much more likely, then, that a government which sought to impose a national
  curriculum, especially in so sensitive an area as history, would be suspected of
  ideological motives. The combatants in the English ‘great history debate’ were therefore
  largely polarized along party lines in a way unthinkable in France, where all enthusiastically
  participated in the rehabilitation of a beloved republican institution. Just as
  the new right saw ‘new’ history as socialist brainwashing, Labour was deeply suspicious
  that the right was attempting to ‘hijack’ history for political purposes. Furthermore,
  many teachers, who recognized the ethnic backgrounds of their pupils in a way their
  French counterparts at least theoretically did not, feared not only a loss of their
  customary autonomy, but that they would be obliged to teach a history that was inappropriate
  or insensitive to their pupils, touting a version of national identity in which
  the latter had no perceptible place. Finally, British historians, unlike their French
  colleagues, were unable to achieve any sort of consensus. Individuals and groups
  therefore took up their positions on either side of the divide which separated right
  from left, and the government from the DES, many teachers, education experts and
  local authorities. These divisions indicated the great challenge of defining national
  identity in a society which officially recognized and valued ethnic and cultural
  pluralism, and which remained reluctant to relinquish the prerogatives which local
  authorities had traditionally exercised over education.\n"
- "\t\n"
- |2+

- "\t  In both countries the 1980s debates had shown how strongly associated school
  history was with visions of the nation’s present and future as well as its past.
  Their curriculum reforms confirmed that, after many parallel experiments in the
  1960s and 1970s, in future France and England would take different paths on the
  contentious matter of school history, paths which reaffirmed two very different
  visions of the nation. By the end of the 1980s it  [End Page 218] appeared that
  France had reached a certainty, and England a compromise. With the new decade, however,
  came new challenges to these visions in the form of European integration, British
  devolution and the globalization spearheaded by unprecedented advances in communications
  technology. These challenges would drive policymakers and curriculum designers back
  to the drawing board to continue the unending dialogue between history and identity.\n"

      The French model of integration and its consequences for history teaching were not entirely unchallenged. In his 1985 report to the Education Minister, L’Immigration à l’école de la République, sociologist and scholar of Islam Jacques Berque suggested that a more inclusive history curriculum might better reinforce national unity. His arguments had no perceptible impact on the 1984–9 school history reforms. From 1989, nationwide interest in the degree to which schools should recognize minority cultures was fuelled by very public debates over whether Muslim girls should be allowed to wear their headscarves in class. Following a strong reaffirmation of official non-recognition of religious or ethnic identities, these and other ‘obvious’ signs of religious belonging were ultimately banned in schools in 2004.

        Many British historians and educationists have examined the rise of the ‘new’ history in English schools in the 1960s and 1970s, and the debates and criticisms this provoked in the 1980s.1  The introduction of the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) in 1986, and the moves towards the National Curriculum at the end of the decade, spurred the thorough politicization of the aims, content and methodology of school history. Yet British historians have thus far neglected to remark upon a near-identical, near-simultaneous debate in France, where politicians and the press were equally concerned that school history was no longer passing on a unifying sense of national identity to pupils. I therefore intend in this article to go beyond strictly insular descriptions of the school history debates in England. Instead, I shall juxtapose the processes of reform in 1980s England and France to explain why the ‘traditionalist’ reaction in France, carried out by the Ministère de l’Education nationale (MEN) under Education Ministers Alain Savary, Jean-Pierre Chevènement, René Monory and Lionel Jospin, was so successful, while reform in England was accompanied by profound conflict and difficult negotiations. In doing so I shall use the school history debates as a means of treating wider themes in the recent history of England and France: the perceived relationship between school history and national identity, and the respective roles of government, bureaucracy, academic historians and the teaching profession in maintaining or challenging this perception.
- "    \n"
- "      I have chosen to compare England, rather than Great Britain, with France,
  despite the fact that ‘British’ identity was more often the object of Conservative
  rhetoric in the 1980s. The National Curriculum, promulgated by the 1988 Education
  Reform Act to come into force in 1991, applied only to England and Wales. Furthermore,
  in an official recognition of the historical and cultural differences between England
  and Wales, separate committees – the History Working Group (HWG) in England, and
  the National Curriculum History Committee for Wales (HCW) – were appointed to devise
  distinct history curricula. Any unitary treatment of school history in Great Britain
  in this period would therefore be misleading and inaccurate. Though Wales had its
  own healthy debate in the run-up to its first official history curriculum of the
  twentieth century, only the English ‘great history debate’, by its intensity and
  publicity, was comparable to that which took place in 1980s France.2  [End Page

  Musée Crozatier. From 1984, all French primary school pupils had to learn chronological
  national history, beginning with the Roman conquest and the defeat in 52 BC at Alésia
  of Vercingétorix, ‘symbol of the resistance’.\n"
- "\t [End Page 200] \n"
- "\tThe 1980s school history debates in England were inspired by fears that ‘new’
  history had in the two preceding decades superseded ‘traditional’ history in schools,
  thereby threatening the transmission of a strong sense of national identity to children.
  The fact that these fears were widely associated with the Conservative Party, and
  in particular the Thatcherite ‘new right’, meant that the school history debates
  became inextricably linked with the two dominant political parties.\n"
- "      \n"
- "\t‘New’ history, which from the 1960s gained widespread support among teachers
  and within the Department for Education and Science (DES), including Her Majesty’s
  Inspectorate (HMI), was based on teachers’ and educationists’ concerns that ‘traditional’
  history – chronological, anglocentric and narrative-based – merely taught pupils
  to memorize rather than to think. ‘New’ history involved a range of fresh approaches;
  more recent history, more non-British history, and ‘history from below’ replaced
  the emphasis on national high politics and battles. Research into children’s learning
  methods, notably that of Jean Piaget, had translated into history teaching as claims
  that that children and even adolescents had only a ‘patchy’ grasp of temporal continuity,
  rendering it ‘entirely unrealistic’ to teach history chronologically.3  In-depth
  studies of particular historical moments were considered more appropriate. The centrality
  of rote learning was replaced by an emphasis on the skills of using and interpreting
  historical sources. Finally, the viewpoint of the elite male Englishman no longer
  dominated. A high value was placed on the ability to view historical events from
  the perspectives of their various participants or contemporary observers – the ‘empathy’
  that would become so controversial in the 1980s.\n"
- "      \n"
- "\tThe evidence indicates that many history teachers were receptive to this renovation
  of their subject. According to Raphael Samuel the Institutes of Education, founded
  in the 1960s, constituted a key site for the transmission to up-and-coming teachers
  of ‘new’ history’s aims and methods.4  As early as 1967 the Central Advisory Council
  for Education reported that while content and quality of teaching varied enormously
  in English schools, ‘child-centred’ methods had become widespread:\n"
- "      \n"
- "\t  the dreary notes copied from the blackboard have largely disappeared and children
  are at least given the opportunity to make their own summaries in which emphasis
  may quite rightly be very different from that of adult historians. . . . History
  frequently provides a successful starting point for spontaneous drama, for narrative
  of the ‘I was there’ kind and for lively art and craft.5 \n"
- "\t‘New’ history also made inroads in secondary teaching. By the end of the 1980s,
  over one-third of secondary schools were using the Schools  [End Page 201] \n"

- "\tHistory Project (SHP) syllabus, which constituted ‘new’ history’s most innovative
  – and to traditionalists its most ignominious – incarnation.6  Created in 1972 by
  the Schools Council, the Project contained units on ‘What is History?’ and ‘History
  Around Us’, and, as the Project’s official evaluator Denis Shemilt wrote, encouraged
  pupils to consider ‘the reality of different sorts of evidence’ and ‘the problems
  of reconstruction in the face of biased, incomplete and contradictory evidence’
  (Shemilt’s emphasis). The in-depth ‘patch’ study of one historical moment was the
  dominant method; the only concession to a long-span chronological approach was the
  ‘Study in Development’, for which History of Medicine was the only course on offer
  in 1980, although the option of ‘Energy through Time’ was later added. ‘Although
  frequently erroneous’, wrote Shemilt, ‘the ideas of History 13–16 students tend
  to be lively and colourful. If not always valid and consistent, their reasoning
  is usually elaborate and ingenious.’7  Educationists’ enthusiasm is well conveyed
  in the 1986 claim by Batho, Booth and Brown that the Project\n"
- "      \n"
- "\t  has done more than any other single agency to promote historical learning among
  secondary school pupils . . . more emphasis has been placed on the encouragement
  of the development of historical skills such as the understanding of concepts, the
  detection of bias and the exercise of imaginative insights.8 \n"
- "\tIf the SHP course remained confined to a significant minority of secondary schools,
  the broader influence of ‘new’ history was palpable in the new GCSE history courses
  introduced in 1986. SHP was the only syllabus accepted unaltered at GCSE level,
  while its philosophy was inherent in the other syllabuses on offer. No common body
  of knowledge was prescribed for GCSE pupils; rather, the authors of the GCSE National
  Criteria for History wrote that ‘coherence is provided by the emphasis in all parts
  of the syllabus on the nature and use of evidence’.9 \n"
- "\tHow did politicians react to the apparent death of traditional, chronological,
  anglocentric school history? The Labour opposition, as might be expected, welcomed
  the eradication of tired jingoism, the reduced concentration on England, and the
  penetration of ‘history from below’ into classrooms. ‘New’ history seemed to indicate
  a certain harmonization between school history and the work of dominant left-wing
  historians like Eric Hobsbawm and Christopher Hill. Conservative opinions, however,
  ranged from caution to disgust. Keith Joseph, Education Minister from 1981 to 1986,
  was sympathetic to methodological innovation and supported children’s use of primary
  source material, their appreciation of history’s selective nature and the use of
  ‘their reason as well as their memories’. Yet he remained attached to the ‘traditional’
  story of the growth of British liberty, believing that history should contribute
  to pupils’  [End Page 203] national pride. In 1984 he told the Historical Association
  Conference that it was\n"
- "      \n"
- "\t  mercifully the case that almost all the people of this country subscribe .
  . . to the value of liberty for the individual under the law, and believe that that
  liberty is least insecure in a parliamentary democracy . . . any child who is not
  given an opportunity to learn how such attitudes have developed and become entrenched
  in our institutions will be deprived of one of the keys to understanding the society
  in which he lives [. . . and] of the opportunity to take a proper pride in what
  these institutions stand for.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\tStudying British political history was crucial, for such understanding and pride
  ‘cannot, however expert the teaching, be conveyed through Roman history or American
  history or Caribbean history’.10 \n"
- "\tPrime Minister Thatcher was less guarded, and expressed her disgust with ‘new’
  history in no uncertain terms. History, she wrote,\n"
- "      \n"
- "\t  is an account of what happened in the past. Learning history, therefore, requires
  knowledge of events [. . . and] a clear chronological framework – which means knowing
  dates. No amount of imaginative sympathy for historical characters or situations
  can be a substitute for the initially tedious but ultimately rewarding business
  of memorizing what actually happened.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\tBy contrast, the temporally disordered, empathetic ‘new’ history was, claimed
  Thatcher ‘at the root of so much that was going wrong’.11 \n"
- "\tFears of teachers and of political indoctrination of pupils were prominent in
  the new right’s condemnation of ‘new’ history. Surely one had only to look at the
  William Tyndale ‘affair’ of 1974–6 to see the nefarious effects of a radicalized
  teaching corps on England’s children; in this north London primary school experiments
  with progressive methods had led to what the Inspectorate called an ‘atmosphere
  of chaotic violence’.12  To Thatcher, then, teachers had become little more than
  the ‘Friendly Red Army’ teaching the ‘Shop Steward Syllabus’.13  At the beginning
  of the 1980s, however, the Tories were in no position to act on this belief. England’s
  long tradition of decentralization left the government with very limited influence
  over the curriculum. The abrogation of payment by results in the 1890s had effectively
  ended central prescription; the 1944 Butler Act required no more than religious
  instruction in schools. When the Schools Council for Curriculum and Examinations
  was established in 1964, it was agreed that teachers would have a majority on all
  important committees. Teachers were therefore both providers of course suggestions
  and materials to their colleagues through the Schools Council, and largely responsible
  for selecting from amongst these materials.14  Furthermore, they were appointed
  and paid by Local Education  [End Page 204] Authorities (LEAs), many of which, complained
  the government, were themselves controlled by the ‘loony left’.15 \n"
- "\tThe principle of non-intervention by the central state in the curriculum first
  appeared to be threatened in the early 1980s. The abolition of the Schools Council
  under Keith Joseph led to dire predictions that the Secretary of State would take
  control, predictions which particularly alarmed history teachers and many academics.
  As Christopher Hill declared when the first rumours of a national curriculum were
  heard, ‘everything in the British democratic tradition has been against allowing
  the state to dictate what history we shall study’.16  For the moment, however, that
  tradition seemed secure. For the rest of the decade, decisions regarding what should
  be taught continued to be made at regional (exam board), local (LEA), school (head
  teacher and department) and individual (classroom teacher) levels.\n"
- "      \n"
- "\tFurthermore, any official, new right vision of history was hindered not only
  by the political opposition and a fiercely independent teaching corps, but also
  by the DES and HMI. Fundamentally, the DES remained supportive of the newer methods.
  Its 1985 publication History in the Primary and Secondary Years: an HMI View noted
  that classes ‘dominated by the need to acquire and remember content’ were outdated
  and that factual recall was ‘likely to be less dominant’ in future examinations.
  Support was given instead to children’s cultivation of ‘historical empathy’.17  Perhaps
  because Labour’s support for ‘history from below’ was seen as inevitable, the DES
  therefore attracted more Tory vitriol. ‘You have an awful department’, Thatcher
  told Joseph in 1983. Kenneth Baker, Joseph’s successor as Education Minister, was
  clearly in agreement. He recorded in his memoirs that:\n"
- "      \n"
- "\t  Of all Whitehall Departments, the DES was among those with the strongest in-house
  ideology. . . . It was rooted in ‘progressive’ orthodoxies, in egalitarianism and
  in the comprehensive school system. . . . Not only was the Department in league
  with the teacher unions, University Departments of Education, teacher-training theories,
  and local authorities, it also acted as their protector against any threats which
  Ministers might pose. If the civil servants were the guardians of this culture,
  then Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Education were its priesthood.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\tBaker recalled how representatives of the teachers’ unions came to the DES ‘almost
  daily’, and how this mutual back-scratching, which rendered Tory reforms so difficult,
  was ‘all part and parcel of the culture of the education establishment which had
  reigned since the 1960s’.18  Yet with the devolution of power to the local level
  so deeply entrenched in British traditions of governance in education, and with
  the curriculum at each school depending on the outcome of selection at a number
  of different levels, the personal opinion of the Secretary of State was largely
  symbolic. As Denis Lawton  [End Page 205] and Stephen Ball have emphasized, this
  structure left the government little room for manoeuvre when lacking the support
  of the Department and teachers’ unions.19 \n"
- "\tIn summary, the English education system of the 1980s was largely decentralized,
  resisted central interference in the name of teacher autonomy and expertise, and
  provided an extremely varied history education in terms both of subjects studied
  and of teaching quality. The central government was absent from the curriculum elaboration
  process, meaning that the new right’s contempt for the so-called establishment’s
  orthodoxies – which included the ‘new’ history – was condemned to have little real
  effect on classroom practice. Thus the years 1986 to 1991 become crucial, for in
  this space between the introduction of the GCSE and that of the National Curriculum,
  the Conservative government put its foot down, and set in motion the reform which
  would bring the curriculum – and, it was hoped, teachers – under central control
  for the first time in the twentieth century.\n"
- "      \n"
- "\tA look across the Channel reveals that the battle between ‘new’ and ‘traditional’
  history was by no means a uniquely British phenomenon. When in 1983 Lord Hugh Thomas,
  historian-advisor to Prime Minister Thatcher, praised the patriotic tenor of history
  in French schools and regretted that school history in England was failing to achieve
  the same end, he was clearly unaware that similar moves away from national(ist)
  school history had also taken place in France since the 1960s.21  Both research
  based on Piagetian theory and the Annales historians’ rejection of histoire événementielle
  had called into question the traditional teaching method of dictating ‘facts’ considered
  central to the national story. This French parallel to British ‘new’ history in
  schools – also often termed la nouvelle histoire – was spearheaded in the 1960s
  and 1970s by journals, notably Cahiers pédagogiques and Enseignement 70; by institutions
  such as the National Institute of Pedagogical Research and Documentation (Institut
  national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique, INRDP); and by engaged individuals
  such as Suzanne Citron, at the time a teacher, Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general
  of teacher training, and Louis François, Dean of the History/Geography group within
  the Inspectorate of National Education. Leif maintained that children should learn
  about historians’ approaches as well as facts, while François declared that teachers
  should provide historic documents and promote ‘active methods’ which would give
  pupils ‘the immense happiness of discovery’.22  With the Inspectorate and INRDP
  falling under the aegis of the Ministry, it is clear that, Lord Thomas’s claims
  notwithstanding, progressive methods had gained significant support within the French
  educational establishment.\n"
- "      \n"
- "\tIn primary schools history was abolished in 1969 as an independent subject, and
  rather vaguely classified as an ‘awakening activity’  [End Page 206] (activité d’éveil)
  within the social sciences. Yet the attempt of Giscard d’Estaing’s Education Minister,
  René Haby, to extend this integrated, thematic approach to the collège (junior high
  school; pupils aged about eleven to fifteen) in 1977 provoked violent reactions
  against the entire philosophie d’éveil which had apparently captured the Inspectorate
  and INRDP. The content and methods of the ‘new’ school history were attacked not
  only by historians but also in the National Assembly and Senate, in the press and
  by prominent public figures in the media and intellectual life.\n"
- "      \n"
- "\tIn June 1977 the Communist Senator Georges Cogniot denounced this progressive
  abandonment of chronology for a thematic approach, which rendered history programmes
  mere ‘skeletons without bodies’. Cogniot was supported by the Socialist Pierre Giraud,
  who cited historian and media personality Alain Decaux and historian Jacques Le
  Goff’s respective characterizations of those without knowledge of their country’s
  past as ‘orphans’ and ‘amnesiacs’.23  The following month in the National Assembly,
  Socialist education delegate Louis Mexandeau denounced the Haby Reform and the failure
  of Haby’s successor, Christian Beullac, to save history as an independent discipline.
  In his self-proclaimed ‘cry of anguish and anger’ he declared that ‘[t]here is no
  history but that which respects chronological continuity’, and denounced the integrated
  courses of history, geography and civics which\n"
- "      \n"
- "\t  inculcate in our youth the forgetfulness of the national past and the relativization
  of values . . .We Socialists will resist those [. . . who] try today to abolish
  the memory of our people.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t  The simple explanation that the left was seeking to criticize a right-wing
  government fails to stand up under scrutiny. Alain Decaux’s article, ‘Parents, we
  are no longer teaching your children history’, which did so much to bring the issue
  to public attention, was published in the conservative Figaro Magazine. Decaux’s
  rhetoric, denouncing children’s ‘ignorance of their origins’ and of heroes of the
  national past as ‘the worst of all solitudes’, was remarkably akin to that employed
  by the French left. Nor were the politicians of the right easily distinguished in
  this respect from the Socialists or Communists. The Gaullist Michel Debré, for example,
  wholeheartedly agreed with Socialist Mexandeau, declaring to the National Assembly
  that\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t    History is first and foremost chronology; chronology has disappeared. History
  is stories; there are no more stories . . .We have abandoned history and geography
  in primary teaching . . . In secondary schools . . . we have suppressed the major
  goal of forming our people.\n"
- "\t  \n"
- "\t  Beullac himself appeared resigned to modifying Haby’s reform. ‘Well aware’,
  he said, that many primary schools no longer taught French history,  [End Page 207]
  he requested time to act.25  Thus with the Communists at one extreme and the far-right
  think tank Le Club de l’Horloge at the other in accord on the necessity of a return
  to chronological national history in schools, there was a clear political consensus.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t  When, in 1980, history professor Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie concluded that ‘concern
  for collective memory is neither revolutionary nor reactionary’, he tapped into
  one of the key reasons for the striking discrepancy between the French and English
  reactions to the ascendancy of ‘new’ history.26  When compulsory and secular primary
  schooling was introduced to France by the Ferry laws in 1881–2, its chief objective,
  to borrow Eugen Weber’s terms, was to turn ‘peasants into Frenchmen’, transforming
  the culturally and linguistically diverse populations of the provinces into a homogenous,
  unified nation.27  Labelled the hussards noirs de la République, primary-school
  teachers were at the forefront of this mission, and French language and history
  were the two chief weapons in their nation-building armoury. A glorious account
  of past heroes and of the consolidation of French territory since the time of ‘our
  ancestors, the Gauls’ would both induct children into the ‘imagined community’ of
  the nation and, crucially, leave them determined to recapture for France the ‘lost
  provinces’ of Alsace and Lorraine.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t  For France’s dominant political parties of the 1980s, all of which were resolutely
  republican, school history’s pivotal role in the consolidation of the republican
  nation-state endowed the history curriculum with enduring symbolic as well as practical
  importance. If national history was necessary to unify the nation, then, logically,
  the failure to teach it meant the death of national identity. When President Mitterrand’s
  Minister of Education, Alain Savary, commissioned history professor René Girault
  to report on the state of history teaching in French schools, the results, submitted
  in 1983, seemed to justify the prevailing sense of crisis. History in primary schools,
  if taught at all, was ‘disjointed’ and lacked ‘chronological coherence’. And politicians
  were alarmed to learn that when 2,600 pupils in their first year of collège were
  surveyed, most could not say when the French Revolution had begun, while many believed
  that d’Artagnan was a more important figure than Mirabeau, and Richelieu more important
  than Robespierre, during the Revolution.28  Mitterrand declared to his Council of
  Ministers on 31 August 1983 – in the process providing the next day’s headlines
  – that he was ‘scandalized and anguished by the loss of collective memory’ in French
  youth, and that reform was clearly necessary.29 \n"
- "\t  For Mitterrand’s France seemed fragmented in new ways. It became clear in the
  1980s that many of the visibly different immigrants who had arrived during the ‘thirty
  glorious years’ of economic boom after the Second World War had no intention of
  going ‘home’. With citizenship acquisition simple for the second generation (requiring
  only five years’ residence and a clean criminal record upon attaining the age of
  majority), and automatic for the third under the double droit du sol, the ‘strategy
  of memory’, enacted  [End Page 208] a century earlier by the Third Republic to unify
  the French population, was seen to have as much practical importance as ever. A
  solid knowledge of national history, it was thought, was crucial to the transformation
  of immigrants and their children into fully integrated French citizens.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t  This historicization of schooling, and of history teaching in particular, accounts
  for the widespread attachment among otherwise differing French politicians to traditional
  school history. Concerns that school history was failing to instil a sense of national
  identity in pupils belonged to all, rather than, as in England, to a particular
  political party. It also reveals why French teachers, like politicians, remained
  committed to traditional aims and approaches in the history classroom. The most
  vocal, notably influential professors in prestigious lycées, were largely resistant
  to the ‘new’ history.30  As Nicole Tutiaux-Guillon has written, only a minority
  of teachers believed that pupils ‘had the right to their own history, be it that
  of a town, a region, of migration, or the history of women’, or disagreed with ‘[t]he
  official standpoint . . . that the curriculum must not be modified to accommodate
  pupils’ preferences or local demands’ – a belief widely shared by pupils and their
  parents.31  So when the Savary and Chevènement reforms cemented the return, in 1984–5,
  to the traditional study of the great periods and personages of French national
  history, many teachers welcomed the reforms.32 \n"
- "\t  This ideological consensus would have been reinforced by the fact that teachers
  in France throughout their careers retained a direct relationship with the central
  state. Unlike England, where teachers’ appointments and pay were local concerns,
  teachers in France were paid directly by the Ministry, which was also responsible
  for recruiting and qualifying secondary-school teachers through national examination,
  the Certificate of Aptitude in Secondary Teaching (Certificat d’aptitude au professorat
  de l’enseignement du second degré, CAPES) or the more prestigious agrégation. The
  Ministry had also been responsible for the curriculum since the 1880s. Égalité in
  education required that pupils throughout the country had access to the same knowledge,
  and this was best be achieved by the application, across all the French provinces,
  of a single curriculum determined in Paris. There could be no greater contrast with
  the principle of central nonintervention predominant in England until the mid 1980s.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t  This principle, however, would not last out the decade. In 1988, the Education
  Reform Act confirmed the advent of the National Curriculum. For the new right, this
  offered an opportunity to combat the supposed dominance of the ideologically-tainted
  ‘new’ history in English schools, which they perceived to have been confirmed by
  the first GCSE examinations of the same year. The history examinations provoked
  some appalled Conservative reactions in the House of Commons. In October,  [End
  Page 209] Nicholas Bennett, Conservative MP for Pembroke and former history teacher,
  roundly attacked GCSE empathy as ‘nothing but historical fiction’. Worse, in the
  hands of biased teachers, GCSE was a dangerous means of political indoctrination.
  Bennett quoted a number of examples, including a trial paper’s ‘outrageous’ demand
  that pupils\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t    Draft a speech to be made by a representative of the Palestine Liberation
  Organization. This speech will justify these actions: the hijacking of aircraft
  to Jordan in 1970, the shootings at Tel Aviv airport and the attack on Israeli athletes
  at the Munich Olympic games.\n"
- "\t  \n"
- "\t  Bennett’s claims echoed a comment made by political economist Robert Skidelsky’s
  earlier that year that empathy was a spectacularly one-sided exercise, with pupils
  asked to imagine themselves suffragettes, Jews in Hitler’s Germany or Palestinians,
  but ‘I have yet to see a sample question inviting Hitler or Mussolini to justify
  his policies’.33  Angela Rumbold, Minister of State for Education and also a former
  history teacher, agreed that Bennett had ‘graphically illustrated’ some of the GCSE’s
  problems, and added her own fear ‘that empathy may squeeze out knowledge and understanding
  rather than reinforce them’.34 \n"
- "\t  Yet the opposition found Tory enthusiasm for a return to more traditional methods
  and content deeply suspect. As early as 1983 Labour MP Jeff Rooker demanded whether
  Joseph recognized that a history core curriculum must include ‘coverage of the period
  when Britain exploited human and material resources in many parts of the world’.
  To which Joseph evasively replied that ‘There is far more good to be said about
  British history than the hon. Gentleman evidently thinks’.35  More provocatively,
  in November 1989 Jack Straw demanded of Rumbold whether National Curriculum history
  would be ‘balanced’, or determined by ‘the Prime Minister and the advisers in the
  No. 10 policy unit who wish to turn the history syllabus into no more than a vehicle
  for the jingoistic, Right-wing indoctrination of our children’.36  Raphael Samuel
  recalled that Straw even came up with his own, equally ‘sectarian’, list of historical
  landmarks, ‘ranging from the Tolpuddle Martyrs to the founding of the Labour Party’,
  and that he sent a letter to academic historians warning that the Conservatives
  were ‘attempting to nobble the new history syllabus for “jingoistic” purposes’.37
  \n"
- "\t  That it was even conceivable to have two distinct lists of dates and events
  constituting the schoolchild’s ‘Conservative’ or ‘Labour’ history of Britain indicates
  the profoundly different political stakes attached to school history in England
  and France. We have seen the origins of the French belief that national history
  must belong to all if the nation-state was to maintain its unity. In practice this
  translated as a consensual ‘list’ of dates and events which had evolved from its
  incarnation in the ‘Petit Lavisse’ textbook history of France in the early years
  of the Third Republic to that of the 1980s curricula a century later. The belief
  was so strong that even the extremely  [End Page 210] varied historians consulted
  prior to the 1984 reform, who included René Girault, Michelle Perrot, Madeleine
  Rebérioux, Mona Ozouf, René Remond, Antoine Prost, Jean Peyrot, Jean-Noël Luc and
  Jacques Le Goff, were in accord. Meeting at Montpellier in January 1984, the historians
  supported the return to tradition, agreeing that not only should school history
  familiarize students with chronology, it should also focus predominantly on national
  history. As Prost summarized:\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t    We have rediscovered here the great republican tradition of the nineteenth
  and twentieth centuries incarnated by Seignobos . . . it is through history teaching
  that pupils learn how a society – our own – functions, how it evolves and changes.
  . . .We must explain our society, our civilization, our institutions to pupils,
  not because they are better than others, but because it so happens that they are
  our own.38 \n"
- "\t  The Montpellier historians’ advice to drop ‘new’ history in schools was consistent
  with that of Fernand Braudel, who, although himself a pioneer of ‘new’ approaches
  in research, had claimed that exposing pupils under seventeen or eighteen to such
  approaches was a ‘primary error’, and of Pierre Goubert, who had denounced the desultory
  study of themes ‘which can be historic or not’, and the focus on local history as
  ‘a perfect aberration’.39  School history and academic research were two distinct
  activities with quite different objectives, and the grey areas which expanded in
  proportion to historiographic reflection were to have no place in the comforting
  black and white of the classroom.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t  Although the historians’ advice was implemented by Socialist Education Ministers
  Savary and Chevènement, the list of dates and events which primary pupils, in their
  exclusive study of France, were required to memorize had no perceptible skew to
  the left; if Jean Jaurès was one twentieth-century personality with whom young children
  were to be familiar, Charles de Gaulle was the other. Yet the best evidence which
  the French comparison provides that a consensual balance was possible is the fact
  that the centreright education minister René Monory, who succeeded Chevènement in
  1986 at the advent of the Mitterrand-Chirac cohabitation, smoothly continued to
  oversee the implementation of the new programmes in the first two years of the collège.
  In the same way, the return of a Socialist, Lionel Jospin, to the head of the Ministry
  in 1988 caused no disruption to the final implementation of the new curriculum in
  1989.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t  Had the English critics of ‘new’ history looked to contemporary developments
  in France, their rejection of claims that they were seeking to create a generation
  of Tories might have gained some legitimacy. The French comparison clearly demonstrated
  the falsity of the somewhat instinctive assumption that, in the context of a modern,
  multi-ethnic western democracy, chronological national history in schools was inherently
  right-wing. What appeared a profoundly Tory project in England was accomplished
  by  [End Page 211] the Socialists in France, with politicians from the Gaullists
  to the Communists applauding what all saw as a battle for the salvation of a threatened
  national identity.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t  Yet was the ‘traditionalist’ solution favoured by the French and the British
  new right viable in England? Had the British been paying attention to the French
  reforms (and there is very little indication they were), the method favoured by
  the French to instil a strong sense of national identity in the young could well
  have appeared questionable. How could a curriculum that focused almost exclusively
  on white male heroes of the metropole, Catholic, or at least (after the Revolution)
  of Catholic background, engage the many French children whose families originated
  from the Muslim Maghreb, from sub-Saharan Africa, Indochina or the West Indies?
  How could a curriculum that gave them no place in French history make them feel
  more French?\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t  The answer lies in an understanding of the differences between French and British
  definitions of citizenship, and, closely related, their respective ideal ‘models’
  of immigrant integration into the national community. As Adrian Favell noted in
  Philosophies of Integration, in France the meaning of ‘Republican citizenship’ had
  become a matter of political consensus. Both left and right accepted ‘the classic
  civic idea of France put together during [the Third Republic] – of France as a universal
  nation of equal and free citizens’. Within the public sphere, there was no official
  recognition of ethnic or cultural groups which would divert the individual’s loyalty
  from the sole group which counted – the nation.40  While immigrant families were
  free within reason to practise their particular religion or culture in the home,
  in the public school, the institution charged with the creation of French citizens,
  any celebration of difference would highlight and entrench these children’s ‘otherness’
  and therefore undermine their integration. Instead, they were encouraged to appropriate
  the history of the French metropole as their own, entirely disregarding something
  so theoretically unimportant as their skin colour, or the religion they practised
  in the completely separate private sphere.41 \n"
- "\t  Nor should it be forgotten that many of these pupils came from colonies which
  had been integrated into France in a way that never occurred in the British Empire.
  Algeria had been officially a part of France for 114 years before independence in
  1962; as far as the French government was concerned, those born in Algeria before
  1962 were French nationals, and those who crossed the Mediterranean in the post-war
  years in many cases merely moved from one French département to another. Their French-born
  ‘Beur’ children acquired automatic citizenship, unhampered by the double droit du
  sol that applied to those who were more clearly ‘immigrants’. In a similar way,
  under the 1946 Constitution of the Fourth Republic France retained Martinique, Guadeloupe,
  French Guiana and Réunion as ‘overseas departments’ (départements d’outre-mer) which
  formed an integral part of  [End Page 212] France as surely as the departments of
  Paris or the Vendée. The distinction metropole/colony, quite easily applied in the
  British context, was therefore less certain in the French. As one country with one
  people – an ideal reflected by the absence of any ethnic classification in French
  censuses – the French had one history, a history that had already in the nineteenth
  century proven its potential to unify those of different cultures and languages.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t  The French relegation of particularism to the private sphere in the name of
  national unity carried with it a certain disdain for the British (or ‘Anglo-Saxon’,
  as it was more often termed) conception of the integrated immigrant-turned-citizen.
  Like the French Socialists of the 1980s, Thatcher’s government was well aware of
  running a culturally and ethnically diverse nation; unlike the French, however,
  British governments since the 1970s had embraced, albeit with varying degrees of
  warmth, an official policy of multiculturalism. While state recognition, even celebration,
  of such variety in public as well as private life seemed to the French a key cause
  of that most frightening fragmenting force, communautarisme; to the British, the
  French method often appeared ‘crudely assimilationist’ and intolerant. Abiding by
  the law was the chief obligation of immigrants in Britain, even if truly ‘fitting
  in’ was best proven by involvement in their local communities. Nor was it necessarily
  expected that they abandon a sense of loyalty to, or identification with, their
  country of origin; Norman Tebbit’s ‘cricket test’ confirmed this in the very ridicule
  it incited.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t  Behind the disputes as to the respective merits of the content and skills-based
  approaches, the school history debates were therefore profoundly concerned with
  the place of diversity in the national imaginary. Post-war immigration had led in
  Britain to an official recognition of communities which cherished multiple identities
  and loyalties. This recognition was reflected in ‘new’ history’s attempt to give
  minorities a historical voice. Through study of the perspectives of the many sorts
  of ‘other’ – the colonized, slaves, immigrants, women, workers and the poor – their
  contribution to history was recognized, while the presence of former colonial peoples
  in Britain was explained, justified and, ideally, valued. In summary, ‘new’ history
  was a natural ally of pluralism. It was rejected by the French, predominantly opposed
  to the official recognition of ethnic communities in accordance with Republican
  tradition, just as it was rejected by those elements of the British right which
  saw ‘native’ culture as threatened by immigration and pluralism. Yet in England,
  with its self-proclaimed multiculturalism, any return to the sort of school history
  which belonged to a pre-multicultural era was impossible, smacking as it did of
  nostalgia and racism.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t  These very different methods of relating school history to national identity
  were reflected in the vocabularies which dominated the school history debates in
  the two countries. The concept of memory and its relation to history was absolutely
  central to the French discourse, which held the  [End Page 213] inculcation of a
  common ‘memory’ of the past to be the best means of uniting those with extremely
  disparate ethno-cultural backgrounds into an homogenous citizenry. Reflecting the
  sense of identity crisis so eloquently described by Pierre Nora, the ministerial
  documents of the 1980s were chiefly remarkable for their explicit association of
  school history, memory and national identity.42  Girault’s assertion in his report
  that ‘history assures the safekeeping of collective memory’ was in keeping with
  the dominant political discourse; Mitterrand had in 1983 justified his demand for
  reform with the claim that ‘a people which loses its memory loses its identity’,
  while Prime Minister Mauroy announced at Montpellier in January 1984 that the main
  cause for studying history was the ‘search for an identity’.43  Terms such as ‘collective
  memory’ and ‘national identity’ were therefore repeatedly employed in the 1980s
  history curricula. By emphasizing that France was ‘a society forged by a common
  history’, the government hoped to restore the ‘roots and depth’ to a national identity
  in crisis.44 \n"
- "\t  By contrast, if teachers of the ‘new’ history in England respected memory as
  the source of competing interpretations of history, it was certainly not something
  that could be instilled at school. Conversely, the concept of ‘empathy’ never even
  entered the French debate. With the acquisition of facts and knowledge as the primary
  goal, French pupils were to be correct and not imaginative; Shemilt’s enthusiasm
  for the highly creative but entirely wrong answers provided by some of the SHP pupils
  found no equivalent in 1980s France. Furthermore, if empathy might have made English
  children better citizens, encouraging them to respect the unfamiliar, the ‘other’
  who was perhaps sitting at the neighbouring desk, there was no equivalent need for
  this in France, where in school, as in public life, there was no recognized ‘other’.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t  As the decade came to an end, the ‘traditionalist’ restoration was successfully
  completed in France. The primary curriculum, finalized under Chevènement in 1985,
  required children to memorize a careful selection of dates, events and personalities,
  from Vercingétorix to de Gaulle, derived from a fundamentally celebratory story
  of the national past. The nineteenth-century module, for instance, was centred on
  ‘France, great colonial and world power’, the twentieth-century one on ‘France,
  great technological and cultural power’.45  Pupils would also spend the third (the
  quatrième) and fifth (the classe de seconde) of their senior years of history focusing
  exclusively on France. Confirming the return to a more celebratory narrative, the
  Ministry recommended in the 1988 programme for the quatrième that ‘French power’
  be the unifying theme for the study of the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries.
  With the focus on the works of Richelieu, Mazarin, Louis XIV and Napoleon, on France’s
  ‘imperial vocation’ and ‘cultural radiance’, the story was one of progress and the
  doings of ‘great men’. Teachers were to avoid the ‘debates and polemics’ provoked
  by the  [End Page 214] approaching Bicentenary of the Revolution; similarly they
  were to refrain from either praising or condemning the imperial project.46  The
  French government thereby confirmed the expulsion of ‘new’ history, with its interest
  in the historian’s role in shaping the presentation of the past, in favour of a
  more traditional belief in the possibility of a single historical narrative which
  could be both correct and inspiring.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t  By 1989, when the final stage of the French reform came into force, the English
  debate was reaching its climax. By that point new right pressure groups such as
  the Hillgate Group, the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), a think-tank founded by
  Thatcher and Joseph in 1974, the History Curriculum Association (HCA) and the Campaign
  for Real Education (CRE) had been crusading for several years against ‘new’ school
  history, which, they claimed, had abandoned the true aims and content of the subject.
  Their primary objective was to restore, à la française, a chronological national
  history to the centre of the curriculum. All were agreed that ‘knowledge of a shared
  past, of a national tradition’ – to borrow the terms of Skidelsky, himself an HCA
  member – needed to replace the highly politicized, leftist history that privileged
  ‘multicultural’ perspectives, and held the cultivation of empathy and generic skills
  to be more important than the solid acquisition of ‘facts’.47 \n"
- "\t  When Baker put together the History Working Group to elaborate the National
  Curriculum for history, his choices alarmed the more extreme traditionalists, including
  Thatcher.48  HWG member Alice Prochaska observed that the group was ‘shrewdly chosen’
  to represent the variety of opinions; she herself had, in an interview prior to
  her appointment to the HWG, ‘disagreed with most of the propositions put to me by
  Kenneth Baker and Angela Rumbold’ and ‘enquired rather worriedly about the amount
  of prescription that was intended’.49  Baker’s respect for those who did not share
  his traditionalist leanings subsequently led Thatcher to conclude that the entire
  process had been corrupted because ‘Ken Baker paid too much attention to the DES,
  the HMI and progressive educational theorists in his appointments and early decisions’.50
  \ While the HWG’s terms of reference insisted upon a common core of British history,
  they also recognized that Britain had been ‘influenced by ideas, movements and events
  elsewhere in the world’, required that opposing views of history be presented to
  students, and prohibited political indoctrination.51 \n"
- "\t  As the HWG worked its way towards the interim then final reports, academic
  historians remained divided as to the respective merits of the ‘traditional’ and
  the ‘new’ school history. Some echoed David Cannadine’s assertion that ‘[t]he new
  GCSE syllabus means that even those schools which teach the subject seriously and
  well will now impart much less of a historical education’.52  Oxford modern history
  professor Norman Stone, for example, agreed with Cannadine that instead of mirroring
  academic trends by sacrificing breadth for depth, schools needed to get back to
  ‘the basic elements of the national past’.53  Jonathan Clark’s defence  [End Page
  215] of national history was particularly pertinent in its assertion that, while
  narrative should dominate school history rather than questions of interpretation,
  the result would not be a generation of brainwashed Conservatives:\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t    Voices as diverse as Gareth Stedman Jones and the new Minister of Education,
  John MacGregor, have called for more British history on a chronological framework.
  Does this have an inbuilt bias to the Right? It is hard to see why it should.54
  \n"
- "\t  Had Clark looked to the contemporary situation in France, he would have found
  ample evidence for his claim that the left was just as capable of producing a national,
  even patriotic, narrative.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t  Defending ‘new’ history were the chiefly left-wing historians engaged in writing
  ‘history from below’. The History Workshop’s first conference on ‘History, the Nation
  and the Schools’ at Ruskin College, Oxford, gave these historians an opportunity
  to face their traditionalist protagonists in June 1989, just over two months before
  the Interim Report was published on 10 August. In a line-up that pitted Stewart
  Deuchar, whom history educationist Robert Phillips labelled ‘the Mary Whitehouse
  of the history world’, and historian Ralph Davis at one extreme against the history
  teachers and educationists Sallie Purkis and John Fines at the other, ‘the new historians
  won easily’ – though it admittedly helped, recalled Roger West in his review of
  the day, that they were ‘playing on home ground to their supporters’.55  Raphael
  Samuel attempted to mediate, reflecting that the traditionalists’ contribution ‘reminds
  us that history is important for what it is about, not merely a means to an end’,
  while the ‘new’ historians’ interest in multiculturalism was, Samuel reassured the
  said traditionalists, a way ‘to remake national history, not to discard it’.56  Yet
  he was unable to dispel the strong impression, not unlike that prevailing in Parliament,
  of two enemy camps with little common ground.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t  When the HWG’s Final Report was published on 3 April 1990, it was clear that
  a determined attempt had been made to reconcile the best of the ‘traditional’ and
  the ‘new’ approaches to school history. Despite the heterogeneity of the British
  population, ‘yet much is shared in common’; it was history’s role to reveal this
  common identity.57  British history therefore comprised over fifty per cent of the
  course content, in accordance with the instructions of the new Secretary of State,
  John MacGregor. However, the authors roundly rejected a ‘Little England’ approach,
  and emphasized the cultural, religious, linguistic and other differences existing
  between and within England, Wales and Scotland, as well as the multiple ‘inheritances’
  (a term which the authors favoured over ‘heritage’, with its false implications
  of cultural or even racial homogeneity) which successive waves of immigration which
  had brought to Britain over the centuries.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t  ‘New’ history was represented in three key ways. Firstly, the HWG recognized
  the SHP and the GCSE for their role in bringing ‘historical  [End Page 216] methodology’
  and investigation of ‘the nature of history’ to pupils. Secondly, the wide choice
  of non-core units and provisions for school-designed units allowed teachers to alternate
  units on local, European and world history with the compulsory British units. Thirdly,
  the HWG resisted traditionalists’ demands for a French-style list of historical
  facts in the attainment targets. There was unanimous agreement that ‘no set of historical
  facts could be drawn up for testing purposes that did not imply a particular interpretation’.58
  \ They also refused to be drawn into the debate over empathy, which they saw as
  positing a false divide between factual knowledge and skills.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t  Despite inevitable criticisms from both right and left, by the time of the
  History Workshop’s second ‘History, the Nation and the Schools’ Ruskin conference,
  in 1990, Raphael Samuel was able to comment that the report had been ‘widely endorsed’.
  Primary-school teacher and HWG member Robert Guyver also remarked that while teachers
  remained worried that their creative capacity would be curbed by prescribed topics,
  there was nevertheless ‘overwhelming support for the ideas enshrined in the attainment
  targets’ and ‘wide approval’ for the HWG’s refusal to pander to extremists by separating
  knowledge from skills.59  The teachers’ verdict on the Final Report was therefore
  largely favourable. Despite the move towards central prescription, Samuel expressed
  his confidence that ‘new’ history would maintain its status when placed in the hands
  of a teaching profession which regarded ‘the idea of an anglocentric history . .
  . with universal derision’.60  Thus Conservative MP John Stokes’s subsequent plea
  for a restored ‘romance’ of the British Empire and a celebration of ‘the glorious
  deeds of our past’ and ‘our wonderful heritage of cathedrals, churches, castles
  and country houses’ was clearly no more than the swan song of ‘traditional’ British
  history.61 \n"
- "\t  The 1980s questioning of ‘new’ history, which had penetrated many French and
  English history classrooms in the 1960s and 1970s, was the result of near-identical
  concerns in the two countries. Critics feared that children were ignorant of national
  history, declared that the absence of a chronological framework was absurd and believed
  that study of the nature of historical evidence was the proper activity of historians,
  not schoolchildren. Yet profound differences between the two societies led to near-opposite
  outcomes. The rapid politicization of school history in France, in particular from
  1979, led to an almost universal recognition that the attempt to teach schoolchildren
  ‘new’ history was a mistake; politicians of all parties, bureaucrats, intellectuals,
  teachers and the public rallied to traditionalism in what Jacques Le Goff termed
  a ‘union sacrée’.62  The historical role played by schools and the history curriculum
  in building a nation of citizens continued to inspire loyalty across the political
  spectrum, especially because, after the rapid demographic and economic changes of
  the now-finished  [End Page 217] trente glorieuses (the post-war ‘glorious thirty
  years’) French identity and unity seemed threatened once more. The reform was therefore
  driven by a republican commitment to homogeneity, blind to ethnic or cultural variation,
  within the public sphere, and by a belief, common to both sides of politics and
  based on the experience of the Third Republic, that a rather celebratory view of
  the national past would reinforce national cohesion.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t  This conception of schooling and national identity went hand-in-hand with a
  tradition of political centralization which rendered the actual implementation of
  the reform simply ‘business as usual’. Central prescription of the curriculum had
  begun with mass schooling a century before; well-habituated, teachers in France
  were confident that this did not prevent creativity or individuality in their work.
  By contrast, England had an equally well-entrenched tradition of local government
  in a wide range of areas. Education was a local responsibility in England just as
  surely as it was a central concern in France. There had been no direct central control
  over the primary curriculum in England for close to a century – while mass secondary
  schooling, with its shorter history, had never had a centrally-determined curriculum.
  It was much more likely, then, that a government which sought to impose a national
  curriculum, especially in so sensitive an area as history, would be suspected of
  ideological motives. The combatants in the English ‘great history debate’ were therefore
  largely polarized along party lines in a way unthinkable in France, where all enthusiastically
  participated in the rehabilitation of a beloved republican institution. Just as
  the new right saw ‘new’ history as socialist brainwashing, Labour was deeply suspicious
  that the right was attempting to ‘hijack’ history for political purposes. Furthermore,
  many teachers, who recognized the ethnic backgrounds of their pupils in a way their
  French counterparts at least theoretically did not, feared not only a loss of their
  customary autonomy, but that they would be obliged to teach a history that was inappropriate
  or insensitive to their pupils, touting a version of national identity in which
  the latter had no perceptible place. Finally, British historians, unlike their French
  colleagues, were unable to achieve any sort of consensus. Individuals and groups
  therefore took up their positions on either side of the divide which separated right
  from left, and the government from the DES, many teachers, education experts and
  local authorities. These divisions indicated the great challenge of defining national
  identity in a society which officially recognized and valued ethnic and cultural
  pluralism, and which remained reluctant to relinquish the prerogatives which local
  authorities had traditionally exercised over education.\n"
- "\t\n"
- "\t  In both countries the 1980s debates had shown how strongly associated school
  history was with visions of the nation’s present and future as well as its past.
  Their curriculum reforms confirmed that, after many parallel experiments in the
  1960s and 1970s, in future France and England would take different paths on the
  contentious matter of school history, paths which reaffirmed two very different
  visions of the nation. By the end of the 1980s it  [End Page 218] appeared that
  France had reached a certainty, and England a compromise. With the new decade, however,
  came new challenges to these visions in the form of European integration, British
  devolution and the globalization spearheaded by unprecedented advances in communications
  technology. These challenges would drive policymakers and curriculum designers back
  to the drawing board to continue the unending dialogue between history and identity.\n"

      The French model of integration and its consequences for history teaching were not entirely unchallenged. In his 1985 report to the Education Minister, L’Immigration à l’école de la République, sociologist and scholar of Islam Jacques Berque suggested that a more inclusive history curriculum might better reinforce national unity. His arguments had no perceptible impact on the 1984–9 school history reforms. From 1989, nationwide interest in the degree to which schools should recognize minority cultures was fuelled by very public debates over whether Muslim girls should be allowed to wear their headscarves in class. Following a strong reaffirmation of official non-recognition of religious or ethnic identities, these and other ‘obvious’ signs of religious belonging were ultimately banned in schools in 2004.

  Teaching in England and France during the 1980s\n\nAbby Waldman  (bio)\n\n\n\n\n
  \     Many British historians and educationists have examined the rise of the ‘new’
  history in English schools in the 1960s and 1970s, and the debates and criticisms
  this provoked in the 1980s.1  The introduction of the General Certificate of Secondary
  Education (GCSE) in 1986, and the moves towards the National Curriculum at the end
  of the decade, spurred the thorough politicization of the aims, content and methodology
  of school history. Yet British historians have thus far neglected to remark upon
  a near-identical, near-simultaneous debate in France, where politicians and the
  press were equally concerned that school history was no longer passing on a unifying
  sense of national identity to pupils. I therefore intend in this article to go beyond
  strictly insular descriptions of the school history debates in England. Instead,
  I shall juxtapose the processes of reform in 1980s England and France to explain
  why the ‘traditionalist’ reaction in France, carried out by the Ministère de l’Education
  nationale (MEN) under Education Ministers Alain Savary, Jean-Pierre Chevènement,
  René Monory and Lionel Jospin, was so successful, while reform in England was accompanied
  by profound conflict and difficult negotiations. In doing so I shall use the school
  history debates as a means of treating wider themes in the recent history of England
  and France: the perceived relationship between school history and national identity,
  and the respective roles of government, bureaucracy, academic historians and the
  teaching profession in maintaining or challenging this perception.\n    \n\n      I
  have chosen to compare England, rather than Great Britain, with France, despite
  the fact that ‘British’ identity was more often the object of Conservative rhetoric
  in the 1980s. The National Curriculum, promulgated by the 1988 Education Reform
  Act to come into force in 1991, applied only to England and Wales. Furthermore,
  in an official recognition of the historical and cultural differences between England
  and Wales, separate committees – the History Working Group (HWG) in England, and
  the National Curriculum History Committee for Wales (HCW) – were appointed to devise
  distinct history curricula. Any unitary treatment of school history in Great Britain
  in this period would therefore be misleading and inaccurate. Though Wales had its
  own healthy debate in the run-up to its first official history curriculum of the
  twentieth century, only the English ‘great history debate’, by its intensity and
  publicity, was comparable to that which took place in 1980s France.2  [End Page

  jetant ses armes aux pieds de César’ (Vercingetorix throws down his arms at the
  feet of [Julius] Caesar), oil painting, Lionel Royer, 1899, Le Puy-en-Velay, Musée
  Crozatier. From 1984, all French primary school pupils had to learn chronological
  national history, beginning with the Roman conquest and the defeat in 52 BC at Alésia
  of Vercingétorix, ‘symbol of the resistance’.\n\t\n\n\n [End Page 200] \nEngland:
  the Party Politics of History Teaching?\n\n\tThe 1980s school history debates in
  England were inspired by fears that ‘new’ history had in the two preceding decades
  superseded ‘traditional’ history in schools, thereby threatening the transmission
  of a strong sense of national identity to children. The fact that these fears were
  widely associated with the Conservative Party, and in particular the Thatcherite
  ‘new right’, meant that the school history debates became inextricably linked with
  the two dominant political parties.\n      \n\n\t‘New’ history, which from the 1960s
  gained widespread support among teachers and within the Department for Education
  and Science (DES), including Her Majesty’s Inspectorate (HMI), was based on teachers’
  and educationists’ concerns that ‘traditional’ history – chronological, anglocentric
  and narrative-based – merely taught pupils to memorize rather than to think. ‘New’
  history involved a range of fresh approaches; more recent history, more non-British
  history, and ‘history from below’ replaced the emphasis on national high politics
  and battles. Research into children’s learning methods, notably that of Jean Piaget,
  had translated into history teaching as claims that that children and even adolescents
  had only a ‘patchy’ grasp of temporal continuity, rendering it ‘entirely unrealistic’
  to teach history chronologically.3  In-depth studies of particular historical moments
  were considered more appropriate. The centrality of rote learning was replaced by
  an emphasis on the skills of using and interpreting historical sources. Finally,
  the viewpoint of the elite male Englishman no longer dominated. A high value was
  placed on the ability to view historical events from the perspectives of their various
  participants or contemporary observers – the ‘empathy’ that would become so controversial
  in the 1980s.\n      \n\n\tThe evidence indicates that many history teachers were
  receptive to this renovation of their subject. According to Raphael Samuel the Institutes
  of Education, founded in the 1960s, constituted a key site for the transmission
  to up-and-coming teachers of ‘new’ history’s aims and methods.4  As early as 1967
  the Central Advisory Council for Education reported that while content and quality
  of teaching varied enormously in English schools, ‘child-centred’ methods had become
  widespread:\n      \n\n\t  the dreary notes copied from the blackboard have largely
  disappeared and children are at least given the opportunity to make their own summaries
  in which emphasis may quite rightly be very different from that of adult historians.
  . . . History frequently provides a successful starting point for spontaneous drama,
  for narrative of the ‘I was there’ kind and for lively art and craft.5 \n\n\t‘New’
  history also made inroads in secondary teaching. By the end of the 1980s, over one-third
  of secondary schools were using the Schools  [End Page 201] \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tClick

  and effect, continuity and change in history. From Joe Scott, Medicine Through Time,
  School Curriculum Development Committee, London, 1987.\n\t  \n\n\n [End Page 202]
  \n\n\tHistory Project (SHP) syllabus, which constituted ‘new’ history’s most innovative
  – and to traditionalists its most ignominious – incarnation.6  Created in 1972 by
  the Schools Council, the Project contained units on ‘What is History?’ and ‘History
  Around Us’, and, as the Project’s official evaluator Denis Shemilt wrote, encouraged
  pupils to consider ‘the reality of different sorts of evidence’ and ‘the problems
  of reconstruction in the face of biased, incomplete and contradictory evidence’
  (Shemilt’s emphasis). The in-depth ‘patch’ study of one historical moment was the
  dominant method; the only concession to a long-span chronological approach was the
  ‘Study in Development’, for which History of Medicine was the only course on offer
  in 1980, although the option of ‘Energy through Time’ was later added. ‘Although
  frequently erroneous’, wrote Shemilt, ‘the ideas of History 13–16 students tend
  to be lively and colourful. If not always valid and consistent, their reasoning
  is usually elaborate and ingenious.’7  Educationists’ enthusiasm is well conveyed
  in the 1986 claim by Batho, Booth and Brown that the Project\n      \n\n\t  has
  done more than any other single agency to promote historical learning among secondary
  school pupils . . . more emphasis has been placed on the encouragement of the development
  of historical skills such as the understanding of concepts, the detection of bias
  and the exercise of imaginative insights.8 \n\n\tIf the SHP course remained confined
  to a significant minority of secondary schools, the broader influence of ‘new’ history
  was palpable in the new GCSE history courses introduced in 1986. SHP was the only
  syllabus accepted unaltered at GCSE level, while its philosophy was inherent in
  the other syllabuses on offer. No common body of knowledge was prescribed for GCSE
  pupils; rather, the authors of the GCSE National Criteria for History wrote that
  ‘coherence is provided by the emphasis in all parts of the syllabus on the nature
  and use of evidence’.9 \n\n\tHow did politicians react to the apparent death of
  traditional, chronological, anglocentric school history? The Labour opposition,
  as might be expected, welcomed the eradication of tired jingoism, the reduced concentration
  on England, and the penetration of ‘history from below’ into classrooms. ‘New’ history
  seemed to indicate a certain harmonization between school history and the work of
  dominant left-wing historians like Eric Hobsbawm and Christopher Hill. Conservative
  opinions, however, ranged from caution to disgust. Keith Joseph, Education Minister
  from 1981 to 1986, was sympathetic to methodological innovation and supported children’s
  use of primary source material, their appreciation of history’s selective nature
  and the use of ‘their reason as well as their memories’. Yet he remained attached
  to the ‘traditional’ story of the growth of British liberty, believing that history
  should contribute to pupils’  [End Page 203] national pride. In 1984 he told the
  Historical Association Conference that it was\n      \n\n\t  mercifully the case
  that almost all the people of this country subscribe . . . to the value of liberty
  for the individual under the law, and believe that that liberty is least insecure
  in a parliamentary democracy . . . any child who is not given an opportunity to
  learn how such attitudes have developed and become entrenched in our institutions
  will be deprived of one of the keys to understanding the society in which he lives
  [. . . and] of the opportunity to take a proper pride in what these institutions
  stand for.\n\t\n\n\tStudying British political history was crucial, for such understanding
  and pride ‘cannot, however expert the teaching, be conveyed through Roman history
  or American history or Caribbean history’.10 \n\n\tPrime Minister Thatcher was less
  guarded, and expressed her disgust with ‘new’ history in no uncertain terms. History,
  she wrote,\n      \n\n\t  is an account of what happened in the past. Learning history,
  therefore, requires knowledge of events [. . . and] a clear chronological framework
  – which means knowing dates. No amount of imaginative sympathy for historical characters
  or situations can be a substitute for the initially tedious but ultimately rewarding
  business of memorizing what actually happened.\n\t\n\n\tBy contrast, the temporally
  disordered, empathetic ‘new’ history was, claimed Thatcher ‘at the root of so much
  that was going wrong’.11 \n\n\tFears of teachers and of political indoctrination
  of pupils were prominent in the new right’s condemnation of ‘new’ history. Surely
  one had only to look at the William Tyndale ‘affair’ of 1974–6 to see the nefarious
  effects of a radicalized teaching corps on England’s children; in this north London
  primary school experiments with progressive methods had led to what the Inspectorate
  called an ‘atmosphere of chaotic violence’.12  To Thatcher, then, teachers had become
  little more than the ‘Friendly Red Army’ teaching the ‘Shop Steward Syllabus’.13
  \ At the beginning of the 1980s, however, the Tories were in no position to act
  on this belief. England’s long tradition of decentralization left the government
  with very limited influence over the curriculum. The abrogation of payment by results
  in the 1890s had effectively ended central prescription; the 1944 Butler Act required
  no more than religious instruction in schools. When the Schools Council for Curriculum
  and Examinations was established in 1964, it was agreed that teachers would have
  a majority on all important committees. Teachers were therefore both providers of
  course suggestions and materials to their colleagues through the Schools Council,
  and largely responsible for selecting from amongst these materials.14  Furthermore,
  they were appointed and paid by Local Education  [End Page 204] Authorities (LEAs),
  many of which, complained the government, were themselves controlled by the ‘loony
  left’.15 \n\n\tThe principle of non-intervention by the central state in the curriculum
  first appeared to be threatened in the early 1980s. The abolition of the Schools
  Council under Keith Joseph led to dire predictions that the Secretary of State would
  take control, predictions which particularly alarmed history teachers and many academics.
  As Christopher Hill declared when the first rumours of a national curriculum were
  heard, ‘everything in the British democratic tradition has been against allowing
  the state to dictate what history we shall study’.16  For the moment, however, that
  tradition seemed secure. For the rest of the decade, decisions regarding what should
  be taught continued to be made at regional (exam board), local (LEA), school (head
  teacher and department) and individual (classroom teacher) levels.\n      \n\n\tFurthermore,
  any official, new right vision of history was hindered not only by the political
  opposition and a fiercely independent teaching corps, but also by the DES and HMI.
  Fundamentally, the DES remained supportive of the newer methods. Its 1985 publication
  History in the Primary and Secondary Years: an HMI View noted that classes ‘dominated
  by the need to acquire and remember content’ were outdated and that factual recall
  was ‘likely to be less dominant’ in future examinations. Support was given instead
  to children’s cultivation of ‘historical empathy’.17  Perhaps because Labour’s support
  for ‘history from below’ was seen as inevitable, the DES therefore attracted more
  Tory vitriol. ‘You have an awful department’, Thatcher told Joseph in 1983. Kenneth
  Baker, Joseph’s successor as Education Minister, was clearly in agreement. He recorded
  in his memoirs that:\n      \n\n\t  Of all Whitehall Departments, the DES was among
  those with the strongest in-house ideology. . . . It was rooted in ‘progressive’
  orthodoxies, in egalitarianism and in the comprehensive school system. . . . Not
  only was the Department in league with the teacher unions, University Departments
  of Education, teacher-training theories, and local authorities, it also acted as
  their protector against any threats which Ministers might pose. If the civil servants
  were the guardians of this culture, then Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Education were
  its priesthood.\n\t\n\n\tBaker recalled how representatives of the teachers’ unions
  came to the DES ‘almost daily’, and how this mutual back-scratching, which rendered
  Tory reforms so difficult, was ‘all part and parcel of the culture of the education
  establishment which had reigned since the 1960s’.18  Yet with the devolution of
  power to the local level so deeply entrenched in British traditions of governance
  in education, and with the curriculum at each school depending on the outcome of
  selection at a number of different levels, the personal opinion of the Secretary
  of State was largely symbolic. As Denis Lawton  [End Page 205] and Stephen Ball
  have emphasized, this structure left the government little room for manoeuvre when
  lacking the support of the Department and teachers’ unions.19 \n\n\tIn summary,
  the English education system of the 1980s was largely decentralized, resisted central
  interference in the name of teacher autonomy and expertise, and provided an extremely
  varied history education in terms both of subjects studied and of teaching quality.
  The central government was absent from the curriculum elaboration process, meaning
  that the new right’s contempt for the so-called establishment’s orthodoxies – which
  included the ‘new’ history – was condemned to have little real effect on classroom
  practice. Thus the years 1986 to 1991 become crucial, for in this space between
  the introduction of the GCSE and that of the National Curriculum, the Conservative
  government put its foot down, and set in motion the reform which would bring the
  curriculum – and, it was hoped, teachers – under central control for the first time
  in the twentieth century.\n      \nFrance: ‘Un Assez Fort Consensus’ and the Return
  to Republican Tradition20 \n\n\tA look across the Channel reveals that the battle
  between ‘new’ and ‘traditional’ history was by no means a uniquely British phenomenon.
  When in 1983 Lord Hugh Thomas, historian-advisor to Prime Minister Thatcher, praised
  the patriotic tenor of history in French schools and regretted that school history
  in England was failing to achieve the same end, he was clearly unaware that similar
  moves away from national(ist) school history had also taken place in France since
  the 1960s.21  Both research based on Piagetian theory and the Annales historians’
  rejection of histoire événementielle had called into question the traditional teaching
  method of dictating ‘facts’ considered central to the national story. This French
  parallel to British ‘new’ history in schools – also often termed la nouvelle histoire
  – was spearheaded in the 1960s and 1970s by journals, notably Cahiers pédagogiques
  and Enseignement 70; by institutions such as the National Institute of Pedagogical
  Research and Documentation (Institut national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique,
  INRDP); and by engaged individuals such as Suzanne Citron, at the time a teacher,
  Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher training, and Louis François, Dean
  of the History/Geography group within the Inspectorate of National Education. Leif
  maintained that children should learn about historians’ approaches as well as facts,
  while François declared that teachers should provide historic documents and promote
  ‘active methods’ which would give pupils ‘the immense happiness of discovery’.22
  \ With the Inspectorate and INRDP falling under the aegis of the Ministry, it is
  clear that, Lord Thomas’s claims notwithstanding, progressive methods had gained
  significant support within the French educational establishment.\n      \n\n\tIn
  primary schools history was abolished in 1969 as an independent subject, and rather
  vaguely classified as an ‘awakening activity’  [End Page 206] (activité d’éveil)
  within the social sciences. Yet the attempt of Giscard d’Estaing’s Education Minister,
  René Haby, to extend this integrated, thematic approach to the collège (junior high
  school; pupils aged about eleven to fifteen) in 1977 provoked violent reactions
  against the entire philosophie d’éveil which had apparently captured the Inspectorate
  and INRDP. The content and methods of the ‘new’ school history were attacked not
  only by historians but also in the National Assembly and Senate, in the press and
  by prominent public figures in the media and intellectual life.\n      \n\n\tIn
  June 1977 the Communist Senator Georges Cogniot denounced this progressive abandonment
  of chronology for a thematic approach, which rendered history programmes mere ‘skeletons
  without bodies’. Cogniot was supported by the Socialist Pierre Giraud, who cited
  historian and media personality Alain Decaux and historian Jacques Le Goff’s respective
  characterizations of those without knowledge of their country’s past as ‘orphans’
  and ‘amnesiacs’.23  The following month in the National Assembly, Socialist education
  delegate Louis Mexandeau denounced the Haby Reform and the failure of Haby’s successor,
  Christian Beullac, to save history as an independent discipline. In his self-proclaimed
  ‘cry of anguish and anger’ he declared that ‘[t]here is no history but that which
  respects chronological continuity’, and denounced the integrated courses of history,
  geography and civics which\n      \n\n\n\t  inculcate in our youth the forgetfulness
  of the national past and the relativization of values . . .We Socialists will resist
  those [. . . who] try today to abolish the memory of our people.\n\t\n\n(Applause
  from the Socialists’ benches).24 \n\n\n\t  The simple explanation that the left
  was seeking to criticize a right-wing government fails to stand up under scrutiny.
  Alain Decaux’s article, ‘Parents, we are no longer teaching your children history’,
  which did so much to bring the issue to public attention, was published in the conservative
  Figaro Magazine. Decaux’s rhetoric, denouncing children’s ‘ignorance of their origins’
  and of heroes of the national past as ‘the worst of all solitudes’, was remarkably
  akin to that employed by the French left. Nor were the politicians of the right
  easily distinguished in this respect from the Socialists or Communists. The Gaullist
  Michel Debré, for example, wholeheartedly agreed with Socialist Mexandeau, declaring
  to the National Assembly that\n\t\n\n\t    History is first and foremost chronology;
  chronology has disappeared. History is stories; there are no more stories . . .We
  have abandoned history and geography in primary teaching . . . In secondary schools
  . . . we have suppressed the major goal of forming our people.\n\t  \n\n\t  Beullac
  himself appeared resigned to modifying Haby’s reform. ‘Well aware’, he said, that
  many primary schools no longer taught French history,  [End Page 207] he requested
  time to act.25  Thus with the Communists at one extreme and the far-right think
  tank Le Club de l’Horloge at the other in accord on the necessity of a return to
  chronological national history in schools, there was a clear political consensus.\n\t\n\n\t
  \ When, in 1980, history professor Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie concluded that ‘concern
  for collective memory is neither revolutionary nor reactionary’, he tapped into
  one of the key reasons for the striking discrepancy between the French and English
  reactions to the ascendancy of ‘new’ history.26  When compulsory and secular primary
  schooling was introduced to France by the Ferry laws in 1881–2, its chief objective,
  to borrow Eugen Weber’s terms, was to turn ‘peasants into Frenchmen’, transforming
  the culturally and linguistically diverse populations of the provinces into a homogenous,
  unified nation.27  Labelled the hussards noirs de la République, primary-school
  teachers were at the forefront of this mission, and French language and history
  were the two chief weapons in their nation-building armoury. A glorious account
  of past heroes and of the consolidation of French territory since the time of ‘our
  ancestors, the Gauls’ would both induct children into the ‘imagined community’ of
  the nation and, crucially, leave them determined to recapture for France the ‘lost
  provinces’ of Alsace and Lorraine.\n\t\n\n\t  For France’s dominant political parties
  of the 1980s, all of which were resolutely republican, school history’s pivotal
  role in the consolidation of the republican nation-state endowed the history curriculum
  with enduring symbolic as well as practical importance. If national history was
  necessary to unify the nation, then, logically, the failure to teach it meant the
  death of national identity. When President Mitterrand’s Minister of Education, Alain
  Savary, commissioned history professor René Girault to report on the state of history
  teaching in French schools, the results, submitted in 1983, seemed to justify the
  prevailing sense of crisis. History in primary schools, if taught at all, was ‘disjointed’
  and lacked ‘chronological coherence’. And politicians were alarmed to learn that
  when 2,600 pupils in their first year of collège were surveyed, most could not say
  when the French Revolution had begun, while many believed that d’Artagnan was a
  more important figure than Mirabeau, and Richelieu more important than Robespierre,
  during the Revolution.28  Mitterrand declared to his Council of Ministers on 31
  August 1983 – in the process providing the next day’s headlines – that he was ‘scandalized
  and anguished by the loss of collective memory’ in French youth, and that reform
  was clearly necessary.29 \n\n\t  For Mitterrand’s France seemed fragmented in new
  ways. It became clear in the 1980s that many of the visibly different immigrants
  who had arrived during the ‘thirty glorious years’ of economic boom after the Second
  World War had no intention of going ‘home’. With citizenship acquisition simple
  for the second generation (requiring only five years’ residence and a clean criminal
  record upon attaining the age of majority), and automatic for the third under the
  double droit du sol, the ‘strategy of memory’, enacted  [End Page 208] a century
  earlier by the Third Republic to unify the French population, was seen to have as
  much practical importance as ever. A solid knowledge of national history, it was
  thought, was crucial to the transformation of immigrants and their children into
  fully integrated French citizens.\n\t\n\n\t  This historicization of schooling,
  and of history teaching in particular, accounts for the widespread attachment among
  otherwise differing French politicians to traditional school history. Concerns that
  school history was failing to instil a sense of national identity in pupils belonged
  to all, rather than, as in England, to a particular political party. It also reveals
  why French teachers, like politicians, remained committed to traditional aims and
  approaches in the history classroom. The most vocal, notably influential professors
  in prestigious lycées, were largely resistant to the ‘new’ history.30  As Nicole
  Tutiaux-Guillon has written, only a minority of teachers believed that pupils ‘had
  the right to their own history, be it that of a town, a region, of migration, or
  the history of women’, or disagreed with ‘[t]he official standpoint . . . that the
  curriculum must not be modified to accommodate pupils’ preferences or local demands’
  – a belief widely shared by pupils and their parents.31  So when the Savary and
  Chevènement reforms cemented the return, in 1984–5, to the traditional study of
  the great periods and personages of French national history, many teachers welcomed
  the reforms.32 \n\n\t  This ideological consensus would have been reinforced by
  the fact that teachers in France throughout their careers retained a direct relationship
  with the central state. Unlike England, where teachers’ appointments and pay were
  local concerns, teachers in France were paid directly by the Ministry, which was
  also responsible for recruiting and qualifying secondary-school teachers through
  national examination, the Certificate of Aptitude in Secondary Teaching (Certificat
  d’aptitude au professorat de l’enseignement du second degré, CAPES) or the more
  prestigious agrégation. The Ministry had also been responsible for the curriculum
  since the 1880s. Égalité in education required that pupils throughout the country
  had access to the same knowledge, and this was best be achieved by the application,
  across all the French provinces, of a single curriculum determined in Paris. There
  could be no greater contrast with the principle of central nonintervention predominant
  in England until the mid 1980s.\n\t\nThe Mid 1980s: Confirmation of British Division
  and French Consensus\n\n\t  This principle, however, would not last out the decade.
  In 1988, the Education Reform Act confirmed the advent of the National Curriculum.
  For the new right, this offered an opportunity to combat the supposed dominance
  of the ideologically-tainted ‘new’ history in English schools, which they perceived
  to have been confirmed by the first GCSE examinations of the same year. The history
  examinations provoked some appalled Conservative reactions in the House of Commons.
  In October,  [End Page 209] Nicholas Bennett, Conservative MP for Pembroke and former
  history teacher, roundly attacked GCSE empathy as ‘nothing but historical fiction’.
  Worse, in the hands of biased teachers, GCSE was a dangerous means of political
  indoctrination. Bennett quoted a number of examples, including a trial paper’s ‘outrageous’
  demand that pupils\n\t\n\n\t    Draft a speech to be made by a representative of
  the Palestine Liberation Organization. This speech will justify these actions: the
  hijacking of aircraft to Jordan in 1970, the shootings at Tel Aviv airport and the
  attack on Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic games.\n\t  \n\n\t  Bennett’s claims
  echoed a comment made by political economist Robert Skidelsky’s earlier that year
  that empathy was a spectacularly one-sided exercise, with pupils asked to imagine
  themselves suffragettes, Jews in Hitler’s Germany or Palestinians, but ‘I have yet
  to see a sample question inviting Hitler or Mussolini to justify his policies’.33
  \ Angela Rumbold, Minister of State for Education and also a former history teacher,
  agreed that Bennett had ‘graphically illustrated’ some of the GCSE’s problems, and
  added her own fear ‘that empathy may squeeze out knowledge and understanding rather
  than reinforce them’.34 \n\n\t  Yet the opposition found Tory enthusiasm for a return
  to more traditional methods and content deeply suspect. As early as 1983 Labour
  MP Jeff Rooker demanded whether Joseph recognized that a history core curriculum
  must include ‘coverage of the period when Britain exploited human and material resources
  in many parts of the world’. To which Joseph evasively replied that ‘There is far
  more good to be said about British history than the hon. Gentleman evidently thinks’.35
  \ More provocatively, in November 1989 Jack Straw demanded of Rumbold whether National
  Curriculum history would be ‘balanced’, or determined by ‘the Prime Minister and
  the advisers in the No. 10 policy unit who wish to turn the history syllabus into
  no more than a vehicle for the jingoistic, Right-wing indoctrination of our children’.36
  \ Raphael Samuel recalled that Straw even came up with his own, equally ‘sectarian’,
  list of historical landmarks, ‘ranging from the Tolpuddle Martyrs to the founding
  of the Labour Party’, and that he sent a letter to academic historians warning that
  the Conservatives were ‘attempting to nobble the new history syllabus for “jingoistic”
  purposes’.37 \n\n\t  That it was even conceivable to have two distinct lists of
  dates and events constituting the schoolchild’s ‘Conservative’ or ‘Labour’ history
  of Britain indicates the profoundly different political stakes attached to school
  history in England and France. We have seen the origins of the French belief that
  national history must belong to all if the nation-state was to maintain its unity.
  In practice this translated as a consensual ‘list’ of dates and events which had
  evolved from its incarnation in the ‘Petit Lavisse’ textbook history of France in
  the early years of the Third Republic to that of the 1980s curricula a century later.
  The belief was so strong that even the extremely  [End Page 210] varied historians
  consulted prior to the 1984 reform, who included René Girault, Michelle Perrot,
  Madeleine Rebérioux, Mona Ozouf, René Remond, Antoine Prost, Jean Peyrot, Jean-Noël
  Luc and Jacques Le Goff, were in accord. Meeting at Montpellier in January 1984,
  the historians supported the return to tradition, agreeing that not only should
  school history familiarize students with chronology, it should also focus predominantly
  on national history. As Prost summarized:\n\t\n\n\t    We have rediscovered here
  the great republican tradition of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries incarnated
  by Seignobos . . . it is through history teaching that pupils learn how a society
  – our own – functions, how it evolves and changes. . . .We must explain our society,
  our civilization, our institutions to pupils, not because they are better than others,
  but because it so happens that they are our own.38 \n\n\t  The Montpellier historians’
  advice to drop ‘new’ history in schools was consistent with that of Fernand Braudel,
  who, although himself a pioneer of ‘new’ approaches in research, had claimed that
  exposing pupils under seventeen or eighteen to such approaches was a ‘primary error’,
  and of Pierre Goubert, who had denounced the desultory study of themes ‘which can
  be historic or not’, and the focus on local history as ‘a perfect aberration’.39
  \ School history and academic research were two distinct activities with quite different
  objectives, and the grey areas which expanded in proportion to historiographic reflection
  were to have no place in the comforting black and white of the classroom.\n\t\n\n\t
  \ Although the historians’ advice was implemented by Socialist Education Ministers
  Savary and Chevènement, the list of dates and events which primary pupils, in their
  exclusive study of France, were required to memorize had no perceptible skew to
  the left; if Jean Jaurès was one twentieth-century personality with whom young children
  were to be familiar, Charles de Gaulle was the other. Yet the best evidence which
  the French comparison provides that a consensual balance was possible is the fact
  that the centreright education minister René Monory, who succeeded Chevènement in
  1986 at the advent of the Mitterrand-Chirac cohabitation, smoothly continued to
  oversee the implementation of the new programmes in the first two years of the collège.
  In the same way, the return of a Socialist, Lionel Jospin, to the head of the Ministry
  in 1988 caused no disruption to the final implementation of the new curriculum in
  1989.\n\t\n\n\t  Had the English critics of ‘new’ history looked to contemporary
  developments in France, their rejection of claims that they were seeking to create
  a generation of Tories might have gained some legitimacy. The French comparison
  clearly demonstrated the falsity of the somewhat instinctive assumption that, in
  the context of a modern, multi-ethnic western democracy, chronological national
  history in schools was inherently right-wing. What appeared a profoundly Tory project
  in England was accomplished by  [End Page 211] the Socialists in France, with politicians
  from the Gaullists to the Communists applauding what all saw as a battle for the
  salvation of a threatened national identity.\n\t\nSchool History and National Cohesion\n\n\t
  \ Yet was the ‘traditionalist’ solution favoured by the French and the British new
  right viable in England? Had the British been paying attention to the French reforms
  (and there is very little indication they were), the method favoured by the French
  to instil a strong sense of national identity in the young could well have appeared
  questionable. How could a curriculum that focused almost exclusively on white male
  heroes of the metropole, Catholic, or at least (after the Revolution) of Catholic
  background, engage the many French children whose families originated from the Muslim
  Maghreb, from sub-Saharan Africa, Indochina or the West Indies? How could a curriculum
  that gave them no place in French history make them feel more French?\n\t\n\n\t
  \ The answer lies in an understanding of the differences between French and British
  definitions of citizenship, and, closely related, their respective ideal ‘models’
  of immigrant integration into the national community. As Adrian Favell noted in
  Philosophies of Integration, in France the meaning of ‘Republican citizenship’ had
  become a matter of political consensus. Both left and right accepted ‘the classic
  civic idea of France put together during [the Third Republic] – of France as a universal
  nation of equal and free citizens’. Within the public sphere, there was no official
  recognition of ethnic or cultural groups which would divert the individual’s loyalty
  from the sole group which counted – the nation.40  While immigrant families were
  free within reason to practise their particular religion or culture in the home,
  in the public school, the institution charged with the creation of French citizens,
  any celebration of difference would highlight and entrench these children’s ‘otherness’
  and therefore undermine their integration. Instead, they were encouraged to appropriate
  the history of the French metropole as their own, entirely disregarding something
  so theoretically unimportant as their skin colour, or the religion they practised
  in the completely separate private sphere.41 \n\n\t  Nor should it be forgotten
  that many of these pupils came from colonies which had been integrated into France
  in a way that never occurred in the British Empire. Algeria had been officially
  a part of France for 114 years before independence in 1962; as far as the French
  government was concerned, those born in Algeria before 1962 were French nationals,
  and those who crossed the Mediterranean in the post-war years in many cases merely
  moved from one French département to another. Their French-born ‘Beur’ children
  acquired automatic citizenship, unhampered by the double droit du sol that applied
  to those who were more clearly ‘immigrants’. In a similar way, under the 1946 Constitution
  of the Fourth Republic France retained Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana and
  Réunion as ‘overseas departments’ (départements d’outre-mer) which formed an integral
  part of  [End Page 212] France as surely as the departments of Paris or the Vendée.
  The distinction metropole/colony, quite easily applied in the British context, was
  therefore less certain in the French. As one country with one people – an ideal
  reflected by the absence of any ethnic classification in French censuses – the French
  had one history, a history that had already in the nineteenth century proven its
  potential to unify those of different cultures and languages.\n\t\n\n\t  The French
  relegation of particularism to the private sphere in the name of national unity
  carried with it a certain disdain for the British (or ‘Anglo-Saxon’, as it was more
  often termed) conception of the integrated immigrant-turned-citizen. Like the French
  Socialists of the 1980s, Thatcher’s government was well aware of running a culturally
  and ethnically diverse nation; unlike the French, however, British governments since
  the 1970s had embraced, albeit with varying degrees of warmth, an official policy
  of multiculturalism. While state recognition, even celebration, of such variety
  in public as well as private life seemed to the French a key cause of that most
  frightening fragmenting force, communautarisme; to the British, the French method
  often appeared ‘crudely assimilationist’ and intolerant. Abiding by the law was
  the chief obligation of immigrants in Britain, even if truly ‘fitting in’ was best
  proven by involvement in their local communities. Nor was it necessarily expected
  that they abandon a sense of loyalty to, or identification with, their country of
  origin; Norman Tebbit’s ‘cricket test’ confirmed this in the very ridicule it incited.\n\t\n\n\t
  \ Behind the disputes as to the respective merits of the content and skills-based
  approaches, the school history debates were therefore profoundly concerned with
  the place of diversity in the national imaginary. Post-war immigration had led in
  Britain to an official recognition of communities which cherished multiple identities
  and loyalties. This recognition was reflected in ‘new’ history’s attempt to give
  minorities a historical voice. Through study of the perspectives of the many sorts
  of ‘other’ – the colonized, slaves, immigrants, women, workers and the poor – their
  contribution to history was recognized, while the presence of former colonial peoples
  in Britain was explained, justified and, ideally, valued. In summary, ‘new’ history
  was a natural ally of pluralism. It was rejected by the French, predominantly opposed
  to the official recognition of ethnic communities in accordance with Republican
  tradition, just as it was rejected by those elements of the British right which
  saw ‘native’ culture as threatened by immigration and pluralism. Yet in England,
  with its self-proclaimed multiculturalism, any return to the sort of school history
  which belonged to a pre-multicultural era was impossible, smacking as it did of
  nostalgia and racism.\n\t\n\n\t  These very different methods of relating school
  history to national identity were reflected in the vocabularies which dominated
  the school history debates in the two countries. The concept of memory and its relation
  to history was absolutely central to the French discourse, which held the  [End
  Page 213] inculcation of a common ‘memory’ of the past to be the best means of uniting
  those with extremely disparate ethno-cultural backgrounds into an homogenous citizenry.
  Reflecting the sense of identity crisis so eloquently described by Pierre Nora,
  the ministerial documents of the 1980s were chiefly remarkable for their explicit
  association of school history, memory and national identity.42  Girault’s assertion
  in his report that ‘history assures the safekeeping of collective memory’ was in
  keeping with the dominant political discourse; Mitterrand had in 1983 justified
  his demand for reform with the claim that ‘a people which loses its memory loses
  its identity’, while Prime Minister Mauroy announced at Montpellier in January 1984
  that the main cause for studying history was the ‘search for an identity’.43  Terms
  such as ‘collective memory’ and ‘national identity’ were therefore repeatedly employed
  in the 1980s history curricula. By emphasizing that France was ‘a society forged
  by a common history’, the government hoped to restore the ‘roots and depth’ to a
  national identity in crisis.44 \n\n\t  By contrast, if teachers of the ‘new’ history
  in England respected memory as the source of competing interpretations of history,
  it was certainly not something that could be instilled at school. Conversely, the
  concept of ‘empathy’ never even entered the French debate. With the acquisition
  of facts and knowledge as the primary goal, French pupils were to be correct and
  not imaginative; Shemilt’s enthusiasm for the highly creative but entirely wrong
  answers provided by some of the SHP pupils found no equivalent in 1980s France.
  Furthermore, if empathy might have made English children better citizens, encouraging
  them to respect the unfamiliar, the ‘other’ who was perhaps sitting at the neighbouring
  desk, there was no equivalent need for this in France, where in school, as in public
  life, there was no recognized ‘other’.\n\t\nTowards the 1990s\n\n\t  As the decade
  came to an end, the ‘traditionalist’ restoration was successfully completed in France.
  The primary curriculum, finalized under Chevènement in 1985, required children to
  memorize a careful selection of dates, events and personalities, from Vercingétorix
  to de Gaulle, derived from a fundamentally celebratory story of the national past.
  The nineteenth-century module, for instance, was centred on ‘France, great colonial
  and world power’, the twentieth-century one on ‘France, great technological and
  cultural power’.45  Pupils would also spend the third (the quatrième) and fifth
  (the classe de seconde) of their senior years of history focusing exclusively on
  France. Confirming the return to a more celebratory narrative, the Ministry recommended
  in the 1988 programme for the quatrième that ‘French power’ be the unifying theme
  for the study of the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries. With the focus on the
  works of Richelieu, Mazarin, Louis XIV and Napoleon, on France’s ‘imperial vocation’
  and ‘cultural radiance’, the story was one of progress and the doings of ‘great
  men’. Teachers were to avoid the ‘debates and polemics’ provoked by the  [End Page
  214] approaching Bicentenary of the Revolution; similarly they were to refrain from
  either praising or condemning the imperial project.46  The French government thereby
  confirmed the expulsion of ‘new’ history, with its interest in the historian’s role
  in shaping the presentation of the past, in favour of a more traditional belief
  in the possibility of a single historical narrative which could be both correct
  and inspiring.\n\t\n\n\t  By 1989, when the final stage of the French reform came
  into force, the English debate was reaching its climax. By that point new right
  pressure groups such as the Hillgate Group, the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS),
  a think-tank founded by Thatcher and Joseph in 1974, the History Curriculum Association
  (HCA) and the Campaign for Real Education (CRE) had been crusading for several years
  against ‘new’ school history, which, they claimed, had abandoned the true aims and
  content of the subject. Their primary objective was to restore, à la française,
  a chronological national history to the centre of the curriculum. All were agreed
  that ‘knowledge of a shared past, of a national tradition’ – to borrow the terms
  of Skidelsky, himself an HCA member – needed to replace the highly politicized,
  leftist history that privileged ‘multicultural’ perspectives, and held the cultivation
  of empathy and generic skills to be more important than the solid acquisition of
  ‘facts’.47 \n\n\t  When Baker put together the History Working Group to elaborate
  the National Curriculum for history, his choices alarmed the more extreme traditionalists,
  including Thatcher.48  HWG member Alice Prochaska observed that the group was ‘shrewdly
  chosen’ to represent the variety of opinions; she herself had, in an interview prior
  to her appointment to the HWG, ‘disagreed with most of the propositions put to me
  by Kenneth Baker and Angela Rumbold’ and ‘enquired rather worriedly about the amount
  of prescription that was intended’.49  Baker’s respect for those who did not share
  his traditionalist leanings subsequently led Thatcher to conclude that the entire
  process had been corrupted because ‘Ken Baker paid too much attention to the DES,
  the HMI and progressive educational theorists in his appointments and early decisions’.50
  \ While the HWG’s terms of reference insisted upon a common core of British history,
  they also recognized that Britain had been ‘influenced by ideas, movements and events
  elsewhere in the world’, required that opposing views of history be presented to
  students, and prohibited political indoctrination.51 \n\n\t  As the HWG worked its
  way towards the interim then final reports, academic historians remained divided
  as to the respective merits of the ‘traditional’ and the ‘new’ school history. Some
  echoed David Cannadine’s assertion that ‘[t]he new GCSE syllabus means that even
  those schools which teach the subject seriously and well will now impart much less
  of a historical education’.52  Oxford modern history professor Norman Stone, for
  example, agreed with Cannadine that instead of mirroring academic trends by sacrificing
  breadth for depth, schools needed to get back to ‘the basic elements of the national
  past’.53  Jonathan Clark’s defence  [End Page 215] of national history was particularly
  pertinent in its assertion that, while narrative should dominate school history
  rather than questions of interpretation, the result would not be a generation of
  brainwashed Conservatives:\n\t\n\n\t    Voices as diverse as Gareth Stedman Jones
  and the new Minister of Education, John MacGregor, have called for more British
  history on a chronological framework. Does this have an inbuilt bias to the Right?
  It is hard to see why it should.54 \n\n\t  Had Clark looked to the contemporary
  situation in France, he would have found ample evidence for his claim that the left
  was just as capable of producing a national, even patriotic, narrative.\n\t\n\n\t
  \ Defending ‘new’ history were the chiefly left-wing historians engaged in writing
  ‘history from below’. The History Workshop’s first conference on ‘History, the Nation
  and the Schools’ at Ruskin College, Oxford, gave these historians an opportunity
  to face their traditionalist protagonists in June 1989, just over two months before
  the Interim Report was published on 10 August. In a line-up that pitted Stewart
  Deuchar, whom history educationist Robert Phillips labelled ‘the Mary Whitehouse
  of the history world’, and historian Ralph Davis at one extreme against the history
  teachers and educationists Sallie Purkis and John Fines at the other, ‘the new historians
  won easily’ – though it admittedly helped, recalled Roger West in his review of
  the day, that they were ‘playing on home ground to their supporters’.55  Raphael
  Samuel attempted to mediate, reflecting that the traditionalists’ contribution ‘reminds
  us that history is important for what it is about, not merely a means to an end’,
  while the ‘new’ historians’ interest in multiculturalism was, Samuel reassured the
  said traditionalists, a way ‘to remake national history, not to discard it’.56  Yet
  he was unable to dispel the strong impression, not unlike that prevailing in Parliament,
  of two enemy camps with little common ground.\n\t\n\n\t  When the HWG’s Final Report
  was published on 3 April 1990, it was clear that a determined attempt had been made
  to reconcile the best of the ‘traditional’ and the ‘new’ approaches to school history.
  Despite the heterogeneity of the British population, ‘yet much is shared in common’;
  it was history’s role to reveal this common identity.57  British history therefore
  comprised over fifty per cent of the course content, in accordance with the instructions
  of the new Secretary of State, John MacGregor. However, the authors roundly rejected
  a ‘Little England’ approach, and emphasized the cultural, religious, linguistic
  and other differences existing between and within England, Wales and Scotland, as
  well as the multiple ‘inheritances’ (a term which the authors favoured over ‘heritage’,
  with its false implications of cultural or even racial homogeneity) which successive
  waves of immigration which had brought to Britain over the centuries.\n\t\n\n\t
  \ ‘New’ history was represented in three key ways. Firstly, the HWG recognized the
  SHP and the GCSE for their role in bringing ‘historical  [End Page 216] methodology’
  and investigation of ‘the nature of history’ to pupils. Secondly, the wide choice
  of non-core units and provisions for school-designed units allowed teachers to alternate
  units on local, European and world history with the compulsory British units. Thirdly,
  the HWG resisted traditionalists’ demands for a French-style list of historical
  facts in the attainment targets. There was unanimous agreement that ‘no set of historical
  facts could be drawn up for testing purposes that did not imply a particular interpretation’.58
  \ They also refused to be drawn into the debate over empathy, which they saw as
  positing a false divide between factual knowledge and skills.\n\t\n\n\t  Despite
  inevitable criticisms from both right and left, by the time of the History Workshop’s
  second ‘History, the Nation and the Schools’ Ruskin conference, in 1990, Raphael
  Samuel was able to comment that the report had been ‘widely endorsed’. Primary-school
  teacher and HWG member Robert Guyver also remarked that while teachers remained
  worried that their creative capacity would be curbed by prescribed topics, there
  was nevertheless ‘overwhelming support for the ideas enshrined in the attainment
  targets’ and ‘wide approval’ for the HWG’s refusal to pander to extremists by separating
  knowledge from skills.59  The teachers’ verdict on the Final Report was therefore
  largely favourable. Despite the move towards central prescription, Samuel expressed
  his confidence that ‘new’ history would maintain its status when placed in the hands
  of a teaching profession which regarded ‘the idea of an anglocentric history . .
  . with universal derision’.60  Thus Conservative MP John Stokes’s subsequent plea
  for a restored ‘romance’ of the British Empire and a celebration of ‘the glorious
  deeds of our past’ and ‘our wonderful heritage of cathedrals, churches, castles
  and country houses’ was clearly no more than the swan song of ‘traditional’ British
  history.61 \nConclusion\n\n\t  The 1980s questioning of ‘new’ history, which had
  penetrated many French and English history classrooms in the 1960s and 1970s, was
  the result of near-identical concerns in the two countries. Critics feared that
  children were ignorant of national history, declared that the absence of a chronological
  framework was absurd and believed that study of the nature of historical evidence
  was the proper activity of historians, not schoolchildren. Yet profound differences
  between the two societies led to near-opposite outcomes. The rapid politicization
  of school history in France, in particular from 1979, led to an almost universal
  recognition that the attempt to teach schoolchildren ‘new’ history was a mistake;
  politicians of all parties, bureaucrats, intellectuals, teachers and the public
  rallied to traditionalism in what Jacques Le Goff termed a ‘union sacrée’.62  The
  historical role played by schools and the history curriculum in building a nation
  of citizens continued to inspire loyalty across the political spectrum, especially
  because, after the rapid demographic and economic changes of the now-finished  [End
  Page 217] trente glorieuses (the post-war ‘glorious thirty years’) French identity
  and unity seemed threatened once more. The reform was therefore driven by a republican
  commitment to homogeneity, blind to ethnic or cultural variation, within the public
  sphere, and by a belief, common to both sides of politics and based on the experience
  of the Third Republic, that a rather celebratory view of the national past would
  reinforce national cohesion.\n\t\n\n\t  This conception of schooling and national
  identity went hand-in-hand with a tradition of political centralization which rendered
  the actual implementation of the reform simply ‘business as usual’. Central prescription
  of the curriculum had begun with mass schooling a century before; well-habituated,
  teachers in France were confident that this did not prevent creativity or individuality
  in their work. By contrast, England had an equally well-entrenched tradition of
  local government in a wide range of areas. Education was a local responsibility
  in England just as surely as it was a central concern in France. There had been
  no direct central control over the primary curriculum in England for close to a
  century – while mass secondary schooling, with its shorter history, had never had
  a centrally-determined curriculum. It was much more likely, then, that a government
  which sought to impose a national curriculum, especially in so sensitive an area
  as history, would be suspected of ideological motives. The combatants in the English
  ‘great history debate’ were therefore largely polarized along party lines in a way
  unthinkable in France, where all enthusiastically participated in the rehabilitation
  of a beloved republican institution. Just as the new right saw ‘new’ history as
  socialist brainwashing, Labour was deeply suspicious that the right was attempting
  to ‘hijack’ history for political purposes. Furthermore, many teachers, who recognized
  the ethnic backgrounds of their pupils in a way their French counterparts at least
  theoretically did not, feared not only a loss of their customary autonomy, but that
  they would be obliged to teach a history that was inappropriate or insensitive to
  their pupils, touting a version of national identity in which the latter had no
  perceptible place. Finally, British historians, unlike their French colleagues,
  were unable to achieve any sort of consensus. Individuals and groups therefore took
  up their positions on either side of the divide which separated right from left,
  and the government from the DES, many teachers, education experts and local authorities.
  These divisions indicated the great challenge of defining national identity in a
  society which officially recognized and valued ethnic and cultural pluralism, and
  which remained reluctant to relinquish the prerogatives which local authorities
  had traditionally exercised over education.\n\t\n\n\t  In both countries the 1980s
  debates had shown how strongly associated school history was with visions of the
  nation’s present and future as well as its past. Their curriculum reforms confirmed
  that, after many parallel experiments in the 1960s and 1970s, in future France and
  England would take different paths on the contentious matter of school history,
  paths which reaffirmed two very different visions of the nation. By the end of the
  1980s it  [End Page 218] appeared that France had reached a certainty, and England
  a compromise. With the new decade, however, came new challenges to these visions
  in the form of European integration, British devolution and the globalization spearheaded
  by unprecedented advances in communications technology. These challenges would drive
  policymakers and curriculum designers back to the drawing board to continue the
  unending dialogue between history and identity.\n\t\n\n\n\nAbby Waldman  \n\t      Abby

  has pointed out that the reality tended to undermine the rhetoric, with ‘elite’

  model of integration and its consequences for history teaching were not entirely
  unchallenged. In his 1985 report to the Education Minister, L’Immigration à l’école
  de la République, sociologist and scholar of Islam Jacques Berque suggested that
  a more inclusive history curriculum might better reinforce national unity. His arguments
  had no perceptible impact on the 1984–9 school history reforms. From 1989, nationwide
  interest in the degree to which schools should recognize minority cultures was fuelled
  by very public debates over whether Muslim girls should be allowed to wear their
  headscarves in class. Following a strong reaffirmation of official non-recognition
  of religious or ethnic identities, these and other ‘obvious’ signs of religious
  belonging were ultimately banned in schools in 2004.\n  \n42. \n      See Pierre

  have examined the rise of the ‘new’ history in English schools in the 1960s and
  1970s, and the debates and criticisms this provoked in the 1980s.1  The introduction
  of the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) in 1986, and the moves
  towards the National Curriculum at the end of the decade, spurred the thorough politicization
  of the aims, content and methodology of school history. Yet British historians have
  thus far neglected to remark upon a near-identical, near-simultaneous debate in
  France, where politicians and the press were equally concerned that school history
  was no longer passing on a unifying sense of national identity to pupils. I therefore
  intend in this article to go beyond strictly insular descriptions of the school
  history debates in England. Instead, I shall juxtapose the processes of reform in
  1980s England and France to explain why the ‘traditionalist’ reaction in France,
  carried out by the Ministère de l’Education nationale (MEN) under Education Ministers
  Alain Savary, Jean-Pierre Chevènement, René Monory and Lionel Jospin, was so successful,
  while reform in England was accompanied by profound conflict and difficult negotiations.
  In doing so I shall use the school history debates as a means of treating wider
  themes in the recent history of England and France: the perceived relationship between
  school history and national identity, and the respective roles of government, bureaucracy,
  academic historians and the teaching profession in maintaining or challenging this
  perception.\n    \n      I have chosen to compare England, rather than Great Britain,
  with France, despite the fact that ‘British’ identity was more often the object
  of Conservative rhetoric in the 1980s. The National Curriculum, promulgated by the
  1988 Education Reform Act to come into force in 1991, applied only to England and
  Wales. Furthermore, in an official recognition of the historical and cultural differences
  between England and Wales, separate committees – the History Working Group (HWG)
  in England, and the National Curriculum History Committee for Wales (HCW) – were
  appointed to devise distinct history curricula. Any unitary treatment of school
  history in Great Britain in this period would therefore be misleading and inaccurate.
  Though Wales had its own healthy debate in the run-up to its first official history
  curriculum of the twentieth century, only the English ‘great history debate’, by
  its intensity and publicity, was comparable to that which took place in 1980s France.2

  had to learn chronological national history, beginning with the Roman conquest and
  the defeat in 52 BC at Alésia of Vercingétorix, ‘symbol of the resistance’.\n\t
  [End Page 200] \n\tThe 1980s school history debates in England were inspired by
  fears that ‘new’ history had in the two preceding decades superseded ‘traditional’
  history in schools, thereby threatening the transmission of a strong sense of national
  identity to children. The fact that these fears were widely associated with the
  Conservative Party, and in particular the Thatcherite ‘new right’, meant that the
  school history debates became inextricably linked with the two dominant political
  parties.\n      \n\t‘New’ history, which from the 1960s gained widespread support
  among teachers and within the Department for Education and Science (DES), including
  Her Majesty’s Inspectorate (HMI), was based on teachers’ and educationists’ concerns
  that ‘traditional’ history – chronological, anglocentric and narrative-based – merely
  taught pupils to memorize rather than to think. ‘New’ history involved a range of
  fresh approaches; more recent history, more non-British history, and ‘history from
  below’ replaced the emphasis on national high politics and battles. Research into
  children’s learning methods, notably that of Jean Piaget, had translated into history
  teaching as claims that that children and even adolescents had only a ‘patchy’ grasp
  of temporal continuity, rendering it ‘entirely unrealistic’ to teach history chronologically.3
  \ In-depth studies of particular historical moments were considered more appropriate.
  The centrality of rote learning was replaced by an emphasis on the skills of using
  and interpreting historical sources. Finally, the viewpoint of the elite male Englishman
  no longer dominated. A high value was placed on the ability to view historical events
  from the perspectives of their various participants or contemporary observers –
  the ‘empathy’ that would become so controversial in the 1980s.\n      \n\tThe evidence
  indicates that many history teachers were receptive to this renovation of their
  subject. According to Raphael Samuel the Institutes of Education, founded in the
  1960s, constituted a key site for the transmission to up-and-coming teachers of
  ‘new’ history’s aims and methods.4  As early as 1967 the Central Advisory Council
  for Education reported that while content and quality of teaching varied enormously
  in English schools, ‘child-centred’ methods had become widespread:\n      \n\t  the
  dreary notes copied from the blackboard have largely disappeared and children are
  at least given the opportunity to make their own summaries in which emphasis may
  quite rightly be very different from that of adult historians. . . . History frequently
  provides a successful starting point for spontaneous drama, for narrative of the
  ‘I was there’ kind and for lively art and craft.5 \n\t‘New’ history also made inroads
  in secondary teaching. By the end of the 1980s, over one-third of secondary schools
  were using the Schools  [End Page 201] \n\t    ‘Why did it happen then?’. This extract
  from a Schools History 13–16 Project textbook directs pupils’ attention to cause
  and effect, continuity and change in history. From Joe Scott, Medicine Through Time,
  School Curriculum Development Committee, London, 1987.\n\t   [End Page 202] \n\tHistory
  Project (SHP) syllabus, which constituted ‘new’ history’s most innovative – and
  to traditionalists its most ignominious – incarnation.6  Created in 1972 by the
  Schools Council, the Project contained units on ‘What is History?’ and ‘History
  Around Us’, and, as the Project’s official evaluator Denis Shemilt wrote, encouraged
  pupils to consider ‘the reality of different sorts of evidence’ and ‘the problems
  of reconstruction in the face of biased, incomplete and contradictory evidence’
  (Shemilt’s emphasis). The in-depth ‘patch’ study of one historical moment was the
  dominant method; the only concession to a long-span chronological approach was the
  ‘Study in Development’, for which History of Medicine was the only course on offer
  in 1980, although the option of ‘Energy through Time’ was later added. ‘Although
  frequently erroneous’, wrote Shemilt, ‘the ideas of History 13–16 students tend
  to be lively and colourful. If not always valid and consistent, their reasoning
  is usually elaborate and ingenious.’7  Educationists’ enthusiasm is well conveyed
  in the 1986 claim by Batho, Booth and Brown that the Project\n      \n\t  has done
  more than any other single agency to promote historical learning among secondary
  school pupils . . . more emphasis has been placed on the encouragement of the development
  of historical skills such as the understanding of concepts, the detection of bias
  and the exercise of imaginative insights.8 \n\tIf the SHP course remained confined
  to a significant minority of secondary schools, the broader influence of ‘new’ history
  was palpable in the new GCSE history courses introduced in 1986. SHP was the only
  syllabus accepted unaltered at GCSE level, while its philosophy was inherent in
  the other syllabuses on offer. No common body of knowledge was prescribed for GCSE
  pupils; rather, the authors of the GCSE National Criteria for History wrote that
  ‘coherence is provided by the emphasis in all parts of the syllabus on the nature
  and use of evidence’.9 \n\tHow did politicians react to the apparent death of traditional,
  chronological, anglocentric school history? The Labour opposition, as might be expected,
  welcomed the eradication of tired jingoism, the reduced concentration on England,
  and the penetration of ‘history from below’ into classrooms. ‘New’ history seemed
  to indicate a certain harmonization between school history and the work of dominant
  left-wing historians like Eric Hobsbawm and Christopher Hill. Conservative opinions,
  however, ranged from caution to disgust. Keith Joseph, Education Minister from 1981
  to 1986, was sympathetic to methodological innovation and supported children’s use
  of primary source material, their appreciation of history’s selective nature and
  the use of ‘their reason as well as their memories’. Yet he remained attached to
  the ‘traditional’ story of the growth of British liberty, believing that history
  should contribute to pupils’  [End Page 203] national pride. In 1984 he told the
  Historical Association Conference that it was\n      \n\t  mercifully the case that
  almost all the people of this country subscribe . . . to the value of liberty for
  the individual under the law, and believe that that liberty is least insecure in
  a parliamentary democracy . . . any child who is not given an opportunity to learn
  how such attitudes have developed and become entrenched in our institutions will
  be deprived of one of the keys to understanding the society in which he lives [.
  . . and] of the opportunity to take a proper pride in what these institutions stand
  for.\n\t\n\tStudying British political history was crucial, for such understanding
  and pride ‘cannot, however expert the teaching, be conveyed through Roman history
  or American history or Caribbean history’.10 \n\tPrime Minister Thatcher was less
  guarded, and expressed her disgust with ‘new’ history in no uncertain terms. History,
  she wrote,\n      \n\t  is an account of what happened in the past. Learning history,
  therefore, requires knowledge of events [. . . and] a clear chronological framework
  – which means knowing dates. No amount of imaginative sympathy for historical characters
  or situations can be a substitute for the initially tedious but ultimately rewarding
  business of memorizing what actually happened.\n\t\n\tBy contrast, the temporally
  disordered, empathetic ‘new’ history was, claimed Thatcher ‘at the root of so much
  that was going wrong’.11 \n\tFears of teachers and of political indoctrination of
  pupils were prominent in the new right’s condemnation of ‘new’ history. Surely one
  had only to look at the William Tyndale ‘affair’ of 1974–6 to see the nefarious
  effects of a radicalized teaching corps on England’s children; in this north London
  primary school experiments with progressive methods had led to what the Inspectorate
  called an ‘atmosphere of chaotic violence’.12  To Thatcher, then, teachers had become
  little more than the ‘Friendly Red Army’ teaching the ‘Shop Steward Syllabus’.13
  \ At the beginning of the 1980s, however, the Tories were in no position to act
  on this belief. England’s long tradition of decentralization left the government
  with very limited influence over the curriculum. The abrogation of payment by results
  in the 1890s had effectively ended central prescription; the 1944 Butler Act required
  no more than religious instruction in schools. When the Schools Council for Curriculum
  and Examinations was established in 1964, it was agreed that teachers would have
  a majority on all important committees. Teachers were therefore both providers of
  course suggestions and materials to their colleagues through the Schools Council,
  and largely responsible for selecting from amongst these materials.14  Furthermore,
  they were appointed and paid by Local Education  [End Page 204] Authorities (LEAs),
  many of which, complained the government, were themselves controlled by the ‘loony
  left’.15 \n\tThe principle of non-intervention by the central state in the curriculum
  first appeared to be threatened in the early 1980s. The abolition of the Schools
  Council under Keith Joseph led to dire predictions that the Secretary of State would
  take control, predictions which particularly alarmed history teachers and many academics.
  As Christopher Hill declared when the first rumours of a national curriculum were
  heard, ‘everything in the British democratic tradition has been against allowing
  the state to dictate what history we shall study’.16  For the moment, however, that
  tradition seemed secure. For the rest of the decade, decisions regarding what should
  be taught continued to be made at regional (exam board), local (LEA), school (head
  teacher and department) and individual (classroom teacher) levels.\n      \n\tFurthermore,
  any official, new right vision of history was hindered not only by the political
  opposition and a fiercely independent teaching corps, but also by the DES and HMI.
  Fundamentally, the DES remained supportive of the newer methods. Its 1985 publication
  History in the Primary and Secondary Years: an HMI View noted that classes ‘dominated
  by the need to acquire and remember content’ were outdated and that factual recall
  was ‘likely to be less dominant’ in future examinations. Support was given instead
  to children’s cultivation of ‘historical empathy’.17  Perhaps because Labour’s support
  for ‘history from below’ was seen as inevitable, the DES therefore attracted more
  Tory vitriol. ‘You have an awful department’, Thatcher told Joseph in 1983. Kenneth
  Baker, Joseph’s successor as Education Minister, was clearly in agreement. He recorded
  in his memoirs that:\n      \n\t  Of all Whitehall Departments, the DES was among
  those with the strongest in-house ideology. . . . It was rooted in ‘progressive’
  orthodoxies, in egalitarianism and in the comprehensive school system. . . . Not
  only was the Department in league with the teacher unions, University Departments
  of Education, teacher-training theories, and local authorities, it also acted as
  their protector against any threats which Ministers might pose. If the civil servants
  were the guardians of this culture, then Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Education were
  its priesthood.\n\t\n\tBaker recalled how representatives of the teachers’ unions
  came to the DES ‘almost daily’, and how this mutual back-scratching, which rendered
  Tory reforms so difficult, was ‘all part and parcel of the culture of the education
  establishment which had reigned since the 1960s’.18  Yet with the devolution of
  power to the local level so deeply entrenched in British traditions of governance
  in education, and with the curriculum at each school depending on the outcome of
  selection at a number of different levels, the personal opinion of the Secretary
  of State was largely symbolic. As Denis Lawton  [End Page 205] and Stephen Ball
  have emphasized, this structure left the government little room for manoeuvre when
  lacking the support of the Department and teachers’ unions.19 \n\tIn summary, the
  English education system of the 1980s was largely decentralized, resisted central
  interference in the name of teacher autonomy and expertise, and provided an extremely
  varied history education in terms both of subjects studied and of teaching quality.
  The central government was absent from the curriculum elaboration process, meaning
  that the new right’s contempt for the so-called establishment’s orthodoxies – which
  included the ‘new’ history – was condemned to have little real effect on classroom
  practice. Thus the years 1986 to 1991 become crucial, for in this space between
  the introduction of the GCSE and that of the National Curriculum, the Conservative
  government put its foot down, and set in motion the reform which would bring the
  curriculum – and, it was hoped, teachers – under central control for the first time
  in the twentieth century.\n      \n\tA look across the Channel reveals that the
  battle between ‘new’ and ‘traditional’ history was by no means a uniquely British
  phenomenon. When in 1983 Lord Hugh Thomas, historian-advisor to Prime Minister Thatcher,
  praised the patriotic tenor of history in French schools and regretted that school
  history in England was failing to achieve the same end, he was clearly unaware that
  similar moves away from national(ist) school history had also taken place in France
  since the 1960s.21  Both research based on Piagetian theory and the Annales historians’
  rejection of histoire événementielle had called into question the traditional teaching
  method of dictating ‘facts’ considered central to the national story. This French
  parallel to British ‘new’ history in schools – also often termed la nouvelle histoire
  – was spearheaded in the 1960s and 1970s by journals, notably Cahiers pédagogiques
  and Enseignement 70; by institutions such as the National Institute of Pedagogical
  Research and Documentation (Institut national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique,
  INRDP); and by engaged individuals such as Suzanne Citron, at the time a teacher,
  Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher training, and Louis François, Dean
  of the History/Geography group within the Inspectorate of National Education. Leif
  maintained that children should learn about historians’ approaches as well as facts,
  while François declared that teachers should provide historic documents and promote
  ‘active methods’ which would give pupils ‘the immense happiness of discovery’.22
  \ With the Inspectorate and INRDP falling under the aegis of the Ministry, it is
  clear that, Lord Thomas’s claims notwithstanding, progressive methods had gained
  significant support within the French educational establishment.\n      \n\tIn primary
  schools history was abolished in 1969 as an independent subject, and rather vaguely
  classified as an ‘awakening activity’  [End Page 206] (activité d’éveil) within
  the social sciences. Yet the attempt of Giscard d’Estaing’s Education Minister,
  René Haby, to extend this integrated, thematic approach to the collège (junior high
  school; pupils aged about eleven to fifteen) in 1977 provoked violent reactions
  against the entire philosophie d’éveil which had apparently captured the Inspectorate
  and INRDP. The content and methods of the ‘new’ school history were attacked not
  only by historians but also in the National Assembly and Senate, in the press and
  by prominent public figures in the media and intellectual life.\n      \n\tIn June
  1977 the Communist Senator Georges Cogniot denounced this progressive abandonment
  of chronology for a thematic approach, which rendered history programmes mere ‘skeletons
  without bodies’. Cogniot was supported by the Socialist Pierre Giraud, who cited
  historian and media personality Alain Decaux and historian Jacques Le Goff’s respective
  characterizations of those without knowledge of their country’s past as ‘orphans’
  and ‘amnesiacs’.23  The following month in the National Assembly, Socialist education
  delegate Louis Mexandeau denounced the Haby Reform and the failure of Haby’s successor,
  Christian Beullac, to save history as an independent discipline. In his self-proclaimed
  ‘cry of anguish and anger’ he declared that ‘[t]here is no history but that which
  respects chronological continuity’, and denounced the integrated courses of history,
  geography and civics which\n      \n\t  inculcate in our youth the forgetfulness
  of the national past and the relativization of values . . .We Socialists will resist
  those [. . . who] try today to abolish the memory of our people.\n\t\n\t  The simple
  explanation that the left was seeking to criticize a right-wing government fails
  to stand up under scrutiny. Alain Decaux’s article, ‘Parents, we are no longer teaching
  your children history’, which did so much to bring the issue to public attention,
  was published in the conservative Figaro Magazine. Decaux’s rhetoric, denouncing
  children’s ‘ignorance of their origins’ and of heroes of the national past as ‘the
  worst of all solitudes’, was remarkably akin to that employed by the French left.
  Nor were the politicians of the right easily distinguished in this respect from
  the Socialists or Communists. The Gaullist Michel Debré, for example, wholeheartedly
  agreed with Socialist Mexandeau, declaring to the National Assembly that\n\t\n\t
  \   History is first and foremost chronology; chronology has disappeared. History
  is stories; there are no more stories . . .We have abandoned history and geography
  in primary teaching . . . In secondary schools . . . we have suppressed the major
  goal of forming our people.\n\t  \n\t  Beullac himself appeared resigned to modifying
  Haby’s reform. ‘Well aware’, he said, that many primary schools no longer taught
  French history,  [End Page 207] he requested time to act.25  Thus with the Communists
  at one extreme and the far-right think tank Le Club de l’Horloge at the other in
  accord on the necessity of a return to chronological national history in schools,
  there was a clear political consensus.\n\t\n\t  When, in 1980, history professor
  Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie concluded that ‘concern for collective memory is neither
  revolutionary nor reactionary’, he tapped into one of the key reasons for the striking
  discrepancy between the French and English reactions to the ascendancy of ‘new’
  history.26  When compulsory and secular primary schooling was introduced to France
  by the Ferry laws in 1881–2, its chief objective, to borrow Eugen Weber’s terms,
  was to turn ‘peasants into Frenchmen’, transforming the culturally and linguistically
  diverse populations of the provinces into a homogenous, unified nation.27  Labelled
  the hussards noirs de la République, primary-school teachers were at the forefront
  of this mission, and French language and history were the two chief weapons in their
  nation-building armoury. A glorious account of past heroes and of the consolidation
  of French territory since the time of ‘our ancestors, the Gauls’ would both induct
  children into the ‘imagined community’ of the nation and, crucially, leave them
  determined to recapture for France the ‘lost provinces’ of Alsace and Lorraine.\n\t\n\t
  \ For France’s dominant political parties of the 1980s, all of which were resolutely
  republican, school history’s pivotal role in the consolidation of the republican
  nation-state endowed the history curriculum with enduring symbolic as well as practical
  importance. If national history was necessary to unify the nation, then, logically,
  the failure to teach it meant the death of national identity. When President Mitterrand’s
  Minister of Education, Alain Savary, commissioned history professor René Girault
  to report on the state of history teaching in French schools, the results, submitted
  in 1983, seemed to justify the prevailing sense of crisis. History in primary schools,
  if taught at all, was ‘disjointed’ and lacked ‘chronological coherence’. And politicians
  were alarmed to learn that when 2,600 pupils in their first year of collège were
  surveyed, most could not say when the French Revolution had begun, while many believed
  that d’Artagnan was a more important figure than Mirabeau, and Richelieu more important
  than Robespierre, during the Revolution.28  Mitterrand declared to his Council of
  Ministers on 31 August 1983 – in the process providing the next day’s headlines
  – that he was ‘scandalized and anguished by the loss of collective memory’ in French
  youth, and that reform was clearly necessary.29 \n\t  For Mitterrand’s France seemed
  fragmented in new ways. It became clear in the 1980s that many of the visibly different
  immigrants who had arrived during the ‘thirty glorious years’ of economic boom after
  the Second World War had no intention of going ‘home’. With citizenship acquisition
  simple for the second generation (requiring only five years’ residence and a clean
  criminal record upon attaining the age of majority), and automatic for the third
  under the double droit du sol, the ‘strategy of memory’, enacted  [End Page 208]
  a century earlier by the Third Republic to unify the French population, was seen
  to have as much practical importance as ever. A solid knowledge of national history,
  it was thought, was crucial to the transformation of immigrants and their children
  into fully integrated French citizens.\n\t\n\t  This historicization of schooling,
  and of history teaching in particular, accounts for the widespread attachment among
  otherwise differing French politicians to traditional school history. Concerns that
  school history was failing to instil a sense of national identity in pupils belonged
  to all, rather than, as in England, to a particular political party. It also reveals
  why French teachers, like politicians, remained committed to traditional aims and
  approaches in the history classroom. The most vocal, notably influential professors
  in prestigious lycées, were largely resistant to the ‘new’ history.30  As Nicole
  Tutiaux-Guillon has written, only a minority of teachers believed that pupils ‘had
  the right to their own history, be it that of a town, a region, of migration, or
  the history of women’, or disagreed with ‘[t]he official standpoint . . . that the
  curriculum must not be modified to accommodate pupils’ preferences or local demands’
  – a belief widely shared by pupils and their parents.31  So when the Savary and
  Chevènement reforms cemented the return, in 1984–5, to the traditional study of
  the great periods and personages of French national history, many teachers welcomed
  the reforms.32 \n\t  This ideological consensus would have been reinforced by the
  fact that teachers in France throughout their careers retained a direct relationship
  with the central state. Unlike England, where teachers’ appointments and pay were
  local concerns, teachers in France were paid directly by the Ministry, which was
  also responsible for recruiting and qualifying secondary-school teachers through
  national examination, the Certificate of Aptitude in Secondary Teaching (Certificat
  d’aptitude au professorat de l’enseignement du second degré, CAPES) or the more
  prestigious agrégation. The Ministry had also been responsible for the curriculum
  since the 1880s. Égalité in education required that pupils throughout the country
  had access to the same knowledge, and this was best be achieved by the application,
  across all the French provinces, of a single curriculum determined in Paris. There
  could be no greater contrast with the principle of central nonintervention predominant
  in England until the mid 1980s.\n\t\n\t  This principle, however, would not last
  out the decade. In 1988, the Education Reform Act confirmed the advent of the National
  Curriculum. For the new right, this offered an opportunity to combat the supposed
  dominance of the ideologically-tainted ‘new’ history in English schools, which they
  perceived to have been confirmed by the first GCSE examinations of the same year.
  The history examinations provoked some appalled Conservative reactions in the House
  of Commons. In October,  [End Page 209] Nicholas Bennett, Conservative MP for Pembroke
  and former history teacher, roundly attacked GCSE empathy as ‘nothing but historical
  fiction’. Worse, in the hands of biased teachers, GCSE was a dangerous means of
  political indoctrination. Bennett quoted a number of examples, including a trial
  paper’s ‘outrageous’ demand that pupils\n\t\n\t    Draft a speech to be made by
  a representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization. This speech will justify
  these actions: the hijacking of aircraft to Jordan in 1970, the shootings at Tel
  Aviv airport and the attack on Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic games.\n\t
  \ \n\t  Bennett’s claims echoed a comment made by political economist Robert Skidelsky’s
  earlier that year that empathy was a spectacularly one-sided exercise, with pupils
  asked to imagine themselves suffragettes, Jews in Hitler’s Germany or Palestinians,
  but ‘I have yet to see a sample question inviting Hitler or Mussolini to justify
  his policies’.33  Angela Rumbold, Minister of State for Education and also a former
  history teacher, agreed that Bennett had ‘graphically illustrated’ some of the GCSE’s
  problems, and added her own fear ‘that empathy may squeeze out knowledge and understanding
  rather than reinforce them’.34 \n\t  Yet the opposition found Tory enthusiasm for
  a return to more traditional methods and content deeply suspect. As early as 1983
  Labour MP Jeff Rooker demanded whether Joseph recognized that a history core curriculum
  must include ‘coverage of the period when Britain exploited human and material resources
  in many parts of the world’. To which Joseph evasively replied that ‘There is far
  more good to be said about British history than the hon. Gentleman evidently thinks’.35
  \ More provocatively, in November 1989 Jack Straw demanded of Rumbold whether National
  Curriculum history would be ‘balanced’, or determined by ‘the Prime Minister and
  the advisers in the No. 10 policy unit who wish to turn the history syllabus into
  no more than a vehicle for the jingoistic, Right-wing indoctrination of our children’.36
  \ Raphael Samuel recalled that Straw even came up with his own, equally ‘sectarian’,
  list of historical landmarks, ‘ranging from the Tolpuddle Martyrs to the founding
  of the Labour Party’, and that he sent a letter to academic historians warning that
  the Conservatives were ‘attempting to nobble the new history syllabus for “jingoistic”
  purposes’.37 \n\t  That it was even conceivable to have two distinct lists of dates
  and events constituting the schoolchild’s ‘Conservative’ or ‘Labour’ history of
  Britain indicates the profoundly different political stakes attached to school history
  in England and France. We have seen the origins of the French belief that national
  history must belong to all if the nation-state was to maintain its unity. In practice
  this translated as a consensual ‘list’ of dates and events which had evolved from
  its incarnation in the ‘Petit Lavisse’ textbook history of France in the early years
  of the Third Republic to that of the 1980s curricula a century later. The belief
  was so strong that even the extremely  [End Page 210] varied historians consulted
  prior to the 1984 reform, who included René Girault, Michelle Perrot, Madeleine
  Rebérioux, Mona Ozouf, René Remond, Antoine Prost, Jean Peyrot, Jean-Noël Luc and
  Jacques Le Goff, were in accord. Meeting at Montpellier in January 1984, the historians
  supported the return to tradition, agreeing that not only should school history
  familiarize students with chronology, it should also focus predominantly on national
  history. As Prost summarized:\n\t\n\t    We have rediscovered here the great republican
  tradition of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries incarnated by Seignobos . .
  . it is through history teaching that pupils learn how a society – our own – functions,
  how it evolves and changes. . . .We must explain our society, our civilization,
  our institutions to pupils, not because they are better than others, but because
  it so happens that they are our own.38 \n\t  The Montpellier historians’ advice
  to drop ‘new’ history in schools was consistent with that of Fernand Braudel, who,
  although himself a pioneer of ‘new’ approaches in research, had claimed that exposing
  pupils under seventeen or eighteen to such approaches was a ‘primary error’, and
  of Pierre Goubert, who had denounced the desultory study of themes ‘which can be
  historic or not’, and the focus on local history as ‘a perfect aberration’.39  School
  history and academic research were two distinct activities with quite different
  objectives, and the grey areas which expanded in proportion to historiographic reflection
  were to have no place in the comforting black and white of the classroom.\n\t\n\t
  \ Although the historians’ advice was implemented by Socialist Education Ministers
  Savary and Chevènement, the list of dates and events which primary pupils, in their
  exclusive study of France, were required to memorize had no perceptible skew to
  the left; if Jean Jaurès was one twentieth-century personality with whom young children
  were to be familiar, Charles de Gaulle was the other. Yet the best evidence which
  the French comparison provides that a consensual balance was possible is the fact
  that the centreright education minister René Monory, who succeeded Chevènement in
  1986 at the advent of the Mitterrand-Chirac cohabitation, smoothly continued to
  oversee the implementation of the new programmes in the first two years of the collège.
  In the same way, the return of a Socialist, Lionel Jospin, to the head of the Ministry
  in 1988 caused no disruption to the final implementation of the new curriculum in
  1989.\n\t\n\t  Had the English critics of ‘new’ history looked to contemporary developments
  in France, their rejection of claims that they were seeking to create a generation
  of Tories might have gained some legitimacy. The French comparison clearly demonstrated
  the falsity of the somewhat instinctive assumption that, in the context of a modern,
  multi-ethnic western democracy, chronological national history in schools was inherently
  right-wing. What appeared a profoundly Tory project in England was accomplished
  by  [End Page 211] the Socialists in France, with politicians from the Gaullists
  to the Communists applauding what all saw as a battle for the salvation of a threatened
  national identity.\n\t\n\t  Yet was the ‘traditionalist’ solution favoured by the
  French and the British new right viable in England? Had the British been paying
  attention to the French reforms (and there is very little indication they were),
  the method favoured by the French to instil a strong sense of national identity
  in the young could well have appeared questionable. How could a curriculum that
  focused almost exclusively on white male heroes of the metropole, Catholic, or at
  least (after the Revolution) of Catholic background, engage the many French children
  whose families originated from the Muslim Maghreb, from sub-Saharan Africa, Indochina
  or the West Indies? How could a curriculum that gave them no place in French history
  make them feel more French?\n\t\n\t  The answer lies in an understanding of the
  differences between French and British definitions of citizenship, and, closely
  related, their respective ideal ‘models’ of immigrant integration into the national
  community. As Adrian Favell noted in Philosophies of Integration, in France the
  meaning of ‘Republican citizenship’ had become a matter of political consensus.
  Both left and right accepted ‘the classic civic idea of France put together during
  [the Third Republic] – of France as a universal nation of equal and free citizens’.
  Within the public sphere, there was no official recognition of ethnic or cultural
  groups which would divert the individual’s loyalty from the sole group which counted
  – the nation.40  While immigrant families were free within reason to practise their
  particular religion or culture in the home, in the public school, the institution
  charged with the creation of French citizens, any celebration of difference would
  highlight and entrench these children’s ‘otherness’ and therefore undermine their
  integration. Instead, they were encouraged to appropriate the history of the French
  metropole as their own, entirely disregarding something so theoretically unimportant
  as their skin colour, or the religion they practised in the completely separate
  private sphere.41 \n\t  Nor should it be forgotten that many of these pupils came
  from colonies which had been integrated into France in a way that never occurred
  in the British Empire. Algeria had been officially a part of France for 114 years
  before independence in 1962; as far as the French government was concerned, those
  born in Algeria before 1962 were French nationals, and those who crossed the Mediterranean
  in the post-war years in many cases merely moved from one French département to
  another. Their French-born ‘Beur’ children acquired automatic citizenship, unhampered
  by the double droit du sol that applied to those who were more clearly ‘immigrants’.
  In a similar way, under the 1946 Constitution of the Fourth Republic France retained
  Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana and Réunion as ‘overseas departments’ (départements
  d’outre-mer) which formed an integral part of  [End Page 212] France as surely as
  the departments of Paris or the Vendée. The distinction metropole/colony, quite
  easily applied in the British context, was therefore less certain in the French.
  As one country with one people – an ideal reflected by the absence of any ethnic
  classification in French censuses – the French had one history, a history that had
  already in the nineteenth century proven its potential to unify those of different
  cultures and languages.\n\t\n\t  The French relegation of particularism to the private
  sphere in the name of national unity carried with it a certain disdain for the British
  (or ‘Anglo-Saxon’, as it was more often termed) conception of the integrated immigrant-turned-citizen.
  Like the French Socialists of the 1980s, Thatcher’s government was well aware of
  running a culturally and ethnically diverse nation; unlike the French, however,
  British governments since the 1970s had embraced, albeit with varying degrees of
  warmth, an official policy of multiculturalism. While state recognition, even celebration,
  of such variety in public as well as private life seemed to the French a key cause
  of that most frightening fragmenting force, communautarisme; to the British, the
  French method often appeared ‘crudely assimilationist’ and intolerant. Abiding by
  the law was the chief obligation of immigrants in Britain, even if truly ‘fitting
  in’ was best proven by involvement in their local communities. Nor was it necessarily
  expected that they abandon a sense of loyalty to, or identification with, their
  country of origin; Norman Tebbit’s ‘cricket test’ confirmed this in the very ridicule
  it incited.\n\t\n\t  Behind the disputes as to the respective merits of the content
  and skills-based approaches, the school history debates were therefore profoundly
  concerned with the place of diversity in the national imaginary. Post-war immigration
  had led in Britain to an official recognition of communities which cherished multiple
  identities and loyalties. This recognition was reflected in ‘new’ history’s attempt
  to give minorities a historical voice. Through study of the perspectives of the
  many sorts of ‘other’ – the colonized, slaves, immigrants, women, workers and the
  poor – their contribution to history was recognized, while the presence of former
  colonial peoples in Britain was explained, justified and, ideally, valued. In summary,
  ‘new’ history was a natural ally of pluralism. It was rejected by the French, predominantly
  opposed to the official recognition of ethnic communities in accordance with Republican
  tradition, just as it was rejected by those elements of the British right which
  saw ‘native’ culture as threatened by immigration and pluralism. Yet in England,
  with its self-proclaimed multiculturalism, any return to the sort of school history
  which belonged to a pre-multicultural era was impossible, smacking as it did of
  nostalgia and racism.\n\t\n\t  These very different methods of relating school history
  to national identity were reflected in the vocabularies which dominated the school
  history debates in the two countries. The concept of memory and its relation to
  history was absolutely central to the French discourse, which held the  [End Page
  213] inculcation of a common ‘memory’ of the past to be the best means of uniting
  those with extremely disparate ethno-cultural backgrounds into an homogenous citizenry.
  Reflecting the sense of identity crisis so eloquently described by Pierre Nora,
  the ministerial documents of the 1980s were chiefly remarkable for their explicit
  association of school history, memory and national identity.42  Girault’s assertion
  in his report that ‘history assures the safekeeping of collective memory’ was in
  keeping with the dominant political discourse; Mitterrand had in 1983 justified
  his demand for reform with the claim that ‘a people which loses its memory loses
  its identity’, while Prime Minister Mauroy announced at Montpellier in January 1984
  that the main cause for studying history was the ‘search for an identity’.43  Terms
  such as ‘collective memory’ and ‘national identity’ were therefore repeatedly employed
  in the 1980s history curricula. By emphasizing that France was ‘a society forged
  by a common history’, the government hoped to restore the ‘roots and depth’ to a
  national identity in crisis.44 \n\t  By contrast, if teachers of the ‘new’ history
  in England respected memory as the source of competing interpretations of history,
  it was certainly not something that could be instilled at school. Conversely, the
  concept of ‘empathy’ never even entered the French debate. With the acquisition
  of facts and knowledge as the primary goal, French pupils were to be correct and
  not imaginative; Shemilt’s enthusiasm for the highly creative but entirely wrong
  answers provided by some of the SHP pupils found no equivalent in 1980s France.
  Furthermore, if empathy might have made English children better citizens, encouraging
  them to respect the unfamiliar, the ‘other’ who was perhaps sitting at the neighbouring
  desk, there was no equivalent need for this in France, where in school, as in public
  life, there was no recognized ‘other’.\n\t\n\t  As the decade came to an end, the
  ‘traditionalist’ restoration was successfully completed in France. The primary curriculum,
  finalized under Chevènement in 1985, required children to memorize a careful selection
  of dates, events and personalities, from Vercingétorix to de Gaulle, derived from
  a fundamentally celebratory story of the national past. The nineteenth-century module,
  for instance, was centred on ‘France, great colonial and world power’, the twentieth-century
  one on ‘France, great technological and cultural power’.45  Pupils would also spend
  the third (the quatrième) and fifth (the classe de seconde) of their senior years
  of history focusing exclusively on France. Confirming the return to a more celebratory
  narrative, the Ministry recommended in the 1988 programme for the quatrième that
  ‘French power’ be the unifying theme for the study of the seventeenth to nineteenth
  centuries. With the focus on the works of Richelieu, Mazarin, Louis XIV and Napoleon,
  on France’s ‘imperial vocation’ and ‘cultural radiance’, the story was one of progress
  and the doings of ‘great men’. Teachers were to avoid the ‘debates and polemics’
  provoked by the  [End Page 214] approaching Bicentenary of the Revolution; similarly
  they were to refrain from either praising or condemning the imperial project.46
  \ The French government thereby confirmed the expulsion of ‘new’ history, with its
  interest in the historian’s role in shaping the presentation of the past, in favour
  of a more traditional belief in the possibility of a single historical narrative
  which could be both correct and inspiring.\n\t\n\t  By 1989, when the final stage
  of the French reform came into force, the English debate was reaching its climax.
  By that point new right pressure groups such as the Hillgate Group, the Centre for
  Policy Studies (CPS), a think-tank founded by Thatcher and Joseph in 1974, the History
  Curriculum Association (HCA) and the Campaign for Real Education (CRE) had been
  crusading for several years against ‘new’ school history, which, they claimed, had
  abandoned the true aims and content of the subject. Their primary objective was
  to restore, à la française, a chronological national history to the centre of the
  curriculum. All were agreed that ‘knowledge of a shared past, of a national tradition’
  – to borrow the terms of Skidelsky, himself an HCA member – needed to replace the
  highly politicized, leftist history that privileged ‘multicultural’ perspectives,
  and held the cultivation of empathy and generic skills to be more important than
  the solid acquisition of ‘facts’.47 \n\t  When Baker put together the History Working
  Group to elaborate the National Curriculum for history, his choices alarmed the
  more extreme traditionalists, including Thatcher.48  HWG member Alice Prochaska
  observed that the group was ‘shrewdly chosen’ to represent the variety of opinions;
  she herself had, in an interview prior to her appointment to the HWG, ‘disagreed
  with most of the propositions put to me by Kenneth Baker and Angela Rumbold’ and
  ‘enquired rather worriedly about the amount of prescription that was intended’.49
  \ Baker’s respect for those who did not share his traditionalist leanings subsequently
  led Thatcher to conclude that the entire process had been corrupted because ‘Ken
  Baker paid too much attention to the DES, the HMI and progressive educational theorists
  in his appointments and early decisions’.50  While the HWG’s terms of reference
  insisted upon a common core of British history, they also recognized that Britain
  had been ‘influenced by ideas, movements and events elsewhere in the world’, required
  that opposing views of history be presented to students, and prohibited political
  indoctrination.51 \n\t  As the HWG worked its way towards the interim then final
  reports, academic historians remained divided as to the respective merits of the
  ‘traditional’ and the ‘new’ school history. Some echoed David Cannadine’s assertion
  that ‘[t]he new GCSE syllabus means that even those schools which teach the subject
  seriously and well will now impart much less of a historical education’.52  Oxford
  modern history professor Norman Stone, for example, agreed with Cannadine that instead
  of mirroring academic trends by sacrificing breadth for depth, schools needed to
  get back to ‘the basic elements of the national past’.53  Jonathan Clark’s defence
  \ [End Page 215] of national history was particularly pertinent in its assertion
  that, while narrative should dominate school history rather than questions of interpretation,
  the result would not be a generation of brainwashed Conservatives:\n\t\n\t    Voices
  as diverse as Gareth Stedman Jones and the new Minister of Education, John MacGregor,
  have called for more British history on a chronological framework. Does this have
  an inbuilt bias to the Right? It is hard to see why it should.54 \n\t  Had Clark
  looked to the contemporary situation in France, he would have found ample evidence
  for his claim that the left was just as capable of producing a national, even patriotic,
  narrative.\n\t\n\t  Defending ‘new’ history were the chiefly left-wing historians
  engaged in writing ‘history from below’. The History Workshop’s first conference
  on ‘History, the Nation and the Schools’ at Ruskin College, Oxford, gave these historians
  an opportunity to face their traditionalist protagonists in June 1989, just over
  two months before the Interim Report was published on 10 August. In a line-up that
  pitted Stewart Deuchar, whom history educationist Robert Phillips labelled ‘the
  Mary Whitehouse of the history world’, and historian Ralph Davis at one extreme
  against the history teachers and educationists Sallie Purkis and John Fines at the
  other, ‘the new historians won easily’ – though it admittedly helped, recalled Roger
  West in his review of the day, that they were ‘playing on home ground to their supporters’.55
  \ Raphael Samuel attempted to mediate, reflecting that the traditionalists’ contribution
  ‘reminds us that history is important for what it is about, not merely a means to
  an end’, while the ‘new’ historians’ interest in multiculturalism was, Samuel reassured
  the said traditionalists, a way ‘to remake national history, not to discard it’.56
  \ Yet he was unable to dispel the strong impression, not unlike that prevailing
  in Parliament, of two enemy camps with little common ground.\n\t\n\t  When the HWG’s
  Final Report was published on 3 April 1990, it was clear that a determined attempt
  had been made to reconcile the best of the ‘traditional’ and the ‘new’ approaches
  to school history. Despite the heterogeneity of the British population, ‘yet much
  is shared in common’; it was history’s role to reveal this common identity.57  British
  history therefore comprised over fifty per cent of the course content, in accordance
  with the instructions of the new Secretary of State, John MacGregor. However, the
  authors roundly rejected a ‘Little England’ approach, and emphasized the cultural,
  religious, linguistic and other differences existing between and within England,
  Wales and Scotland, as well as the multiple ‘inheritances’ (a term which the authors
  favoured over ‘heritage’, with its false implications of cultural or even racial
  homogeneity) which successive waves of immigration which had brought to Britain
  over the centuries.\n\t\n\t  ‘New’ history was represented in three key ways. Firstly,
  the HWG recognized the SHP and the GCSE for their role in bringing ‘historical  [End
  Page 216] methodology’ and investigation of ‘the nature of history’ to pupils. Secondly,
  the wide choice of non-core units and provisions for school-designed units allowed
  teachers to alternate units on local, European and world history with the compulsory
  British units. Thirdly, the HWG resisted traditionalists’ demands for a French-style
  list of historical facts in the attainment targets. There was unanimous agreement
  that ‘no set of historical facts could be drawn up for testing purposes that did
  not imply a particular interpretation’.58  They also refused to be drawn into the
  debate over empathy, which they saw as positing a false divide between factual knowledge
  and skills.\n\t\n\t  Despite inevitable criticisms from both right and left, by
  the time of the History Workshop’s second ‘History, the Nation and the Schools’
  Ruskin conference, in 1990, Raphael Samuel was able to comment that the report had
  been ‘widely endorsed’. Primary-school teacher and HWG member Robert Guyver also
  remarked that while teachers remained worried that their creative capacity would
  be curbed by prescribed topics, there was nevertheless ‘overwhelming support for
  the ideas enshrined in the attainment targets’ and ‘wide approval’ for the HWG’s
  refusal to pander to extremists by separating knowledge from skills.59  The teachers’
  verdict on the Final Report was therefore largely favourable. Despite the move towards
  central prescription, Samuel expressed his confidence that ‘new’ history would maintain
  its status when placed in the hands of a teaching profession which regarded ‘the
  idea of an anglocentric history . . . with universal derision’.60  Thus Conservative
  MP John Stokes’s subsequent plea for a restored ‘romance’ of the British Empire
  and a celebration of ‘the glorious deeds of our past’ and ‘our wonderful heritage
  of cathedrals, churches, castles and country houses’ was clearly no more than the
  swan song of ‘traditional’ British history.61 \n\t  The 1980s questioning of ‘new’
  history, which had penetrated many French and English history classrooms in the
  1960s and 1970s, was the result of near-identical concerns in the two countries.
  Critics feared that children were ignorant of national history, declared that the
  absence of a chronological framework was absurd and believed that study of the nature
  of historical evidence was the proper activity of historians, not schoolchildren.
  Yet profound differences between the two societies led to near-opposite outcomes.
  The rapid politicization of school history in France, in particular from 1979, led
  to an almost universal recognition that the attempt to teach schoolchildren ‘new’
  history was a mistake; politicians of all parties, bureaucrats, intellectuals, teachers
  and the public rallied to traditionalism in what Jacques Le Goff termed a ‘union
  sacrée’.62  The historical role played by schools and the history curriculum in
  building a nation of citizens continued to inspire loyalty across the political
  spectrum, especially because, after the rapid demographic and economic changes of
  the now-finished  [End Page 217] trente glorieuses (the post-war ‘glorious thirty
  years’) French identity and unity seemed threatened once more. The reform was therefore
  driven by a republican commitment to homogeneity, blind to ethnic or cultural variation,
  within the public sphere, and by a belief, common to both sides of politics and
  based on the experience of the Third Republic, that a rather celebratory view of
  the national past would reinforce national cohesion.\n\t\n\t  This conception of
  schooling and national identity went hand-in-hand with a tradition of political
  centralization which rendered the actual implementation of the reform simply ‘business
  as usual’. Central prescription of the curriculum had begun with mass schooling
  a century before; well-habituated, teachers in France were confident that this did
  not prevent creativity or individuality in their work. By contrast, England had
  an equally well-entrenched tradition of local government in a wide range of areas.
  Education was a local responsibility in England just as surely as it was a central
  concern in France. There had been no direct central control over the primary curriculum
  in England for close to a century – while mass secondary schooling, with its shorter
  history, had never had a centrally-determined curriculum. It was much more likely,
  then, that a government which sought to impose a national curriculum, especially
  in so sensitive an area as history, would be suspected of ideological motives. The
  combatants in the English ‘great history debate’ were therefore largely polarized
  along party lines in a way unthinkable in France, where all enthusiastically participated
  in the rehabilitation of a beloved republican institution. Just as the new right
  saw ‘new’ history as socialist brainwashing, Labour was deeply suspicious that the
  right was attempting to ‘hijack’ history for political purposes. Furthermore, many
  teachers, who recognized the ethnic backgrounds of their pupils in a way their French
  counterparts at least theoretically did not, feared not only a loss of their customary
  autonomy, but that they would be obliged to teach a history that was inappropriate
  or insensitive to their pupils, touting a version of national identity in which
  the latter had no perceptible place. Finally, British historians, unlike their French
  colleagues, were unable to achieve any sort of consensus. Individuals and groups
  therefore took up their positions on either side of the divide which separated right
  from left, and the government from the DES, many teachers, education experts and
  local authorities. These divisions indicated the great challenge of defining national
  identity in a society which officially recognized and valued ethnic and cultural
  pluralism, and which remained reluctant to relinquish the prerogatives which local
  authorities had traditionally exercised over education.\n\t\n\t  In both countries
  the 1980s debates had shown how strongly associated school history was with visions
  of the nation’s present and future as well as its past. Their curriculum reforms
  confirmed that, after many parallel experiments in the 1960s and 1970s, in future
  France and England would take different paths on the contentious matter of school
  history, paths which reaffirmed two very different visions of the nation. By the
  end of the 1980s it  [End Page 218] appeared that France had reached a certainty,
  and England a compromise. With the new decade, however, came new challenges to these
  visions in the form of European integration, British devolution and the globalization
  spearheaded by unprecedented advances in communications technology. These challenges
  would drive policymakers and curriculum designers back to the drawing board to continue
  the unending dialogue between history and identity.\n\t\n\t      Abby Waldman is

  has pointed out that the reality tended to undermine the rhetoric, with ‘elite’
  spokespersons often sought out by the government to act as intermediaries between
  community groups and the State, while community initiatives and associations were
  increasingly funded throughout the 1980s by the State’s Fonds d’Action Sociale.
  See Kastoryano, Negotiating Identities, Princeton, 2002.\n    41. \n    The French
  model of integration and its consequences for history teaching were not entirely
  unchallenged. In his 1985 report to the Education Minister, L’Immigration à l’école
  de la République, sociologist and scholar of Islam Jacques Berque suggested that
  a more inclusive history curriculum might better reinforce national unity. His arguments
  had no perceptible impact on the 1984–9 school history reforms. From 1989, nationwide
  interest in the degree to which schools should recognize minority cultures was fuelled
  by very public debates over whether Muslim girls should be allowed to wear their
  headscarves in class. Following a strong reaffirmation of official non-recognition
  of religious or ethnic identities, these and other ‘obvious’ signs of religious
  belonging were ultimately banned in schools in 2004.\n  42. \n      See Pierre Nora,
