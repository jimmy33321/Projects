  There are a lot of balance transfer credit cards out there, designed specifically for anyone who is carrying a balance on their credit card and paying high (or any) interest fees each month. In fact, there are so many it can be challenging to determine how one is better or worse than the others. Chase Slate is one of the cards vying for your business, and we took an in-depth look at this card to answer the question “is it any good?” The short answer is yes, it’s a great choice that can save you hundreds or thousands of dollars if you’re currently paying interest on another credit card.Â  It’s the only card we’ve found with the combination of a lengthy 0% intro APR and no balance transfer fee. The in-depth answer, as well as the card’s pros and cons, is explained below.
- |
  The Highlights
- |
  Right after the holidays most people have racked up a balance on their credit cards and are wondering how they are going to pay it off. Chase Slate is a strong solution, offering a 15-month 0% intro APR on both balance transfers and purchases. Many cards offer a 0% intro APR, but the best part about Slate is that you won’t pay any balance transfer fees to move your balance(s) onto this card. That’s a huge win, since these fees are typically 3% of the balance you’re transferring, which can add up to big money. For example, if you’re transferringÂ $10,000 you’d probably pay $300 in fees with other cards. With SlateÂ you pay absolutely nothing to transfer your money, and you have 15Â interest-free months to make payments against the balance, which canÂ give you even bigger savings. For example, if you were making $700Â monthly payments on that $10,000 balance and had a 20% interest rate,Â it would take you 17 months to pay it off and you’d pay over $1,500 inÂ interest. If you transferred that balance to Slate, you’d pay it offÂ in 15 months with no interest, saving $1,500 and paying absolutely noÂ fees.Â Just make sure you transfer your balance in the first 60 days to take advantage of the $0 balance transfer fee, as after that time there will be a fee.
- |
  In addition to the 0% intro APR on balance transfers, you’ll also pay no interest for 15 months on purchases. This is a great way to make any big (or small) purchases you need and save money on interest fees for over a year. Plus, Slate has no annual fee and a fairly low ongoing APR after the 0% intro APR period which is important if you plan to carry a balance after the 15 months are up.
- |
  If you’ve been known to make a late payment or two you’ll appreciate that Slate has no penalty APR. This means your interest rate won’t increase if your payment is delayed. We don’t recommend habitually paying your bill late, but it’s nice to know if it does happens you won’t be penalized for it.
- |
  Another huge point in Slate’s favor is that it’s available to those with good credit. A good credit score is typically considered to be above 660.Â Usually credit cards with the best offers are only available to people with excellent credit histories, but Slate has all the great features offered to excellent credit consumers and is open to those with merely good credit. So if you’ve missed a payment or two, or had some other minor hits on your credit report you will likely still qualify for this card. Of course, Slate also considers other factors like your annual salary and wages, your other annual income and a review of your debt, but in general those with good credit have a good shot.
- |
  World travelers will appreciate that Slate nowÂ offers Chip and PIN technology. Chip-enabled cards are usually required when traveling outside the U.S., and if your card doesn’t have one you might not be able to use it when traveling internationally.
- |
  Things To Consider
- |
  Chase Slate is a smart way to gradually pay down your balance over the course of the 15-month 0% intro APR period, and after the no-interest period is up it continues to offer reasonable ongoing APRs. However, if you think you might be carrying your balance for a prolonged time, Barclaycard Ring Mastercard might be a better solution for you. It doesn’t have a 0% intro APR period, but features no balance transfer fee, no annual fee and a one of the lowest ongoing APRs we’ve ever seen – 8.00% .
- |
  If a 15-month 0% intro APR isn’t quite enough, but you think you can pay down your balance in under 2 years, consider Citi Simplicity. ItÂ has an incredibly lengthy 21-month intro APR on balance transfers and purchases, which would give you an extra 6 months of 0% APR breathing room. There is a 3% balance transfer fee, but those 6 extra months might make it worthwhile.
- |
  Slate’s chip-enabled card makes it easy to travel internationally, but there is a 3% foreign transaction fee for each purchase you make. This fee can add up, particularly if you’re taking a long vacation and charging most purchases onto your card. If this is a deal-breaker for you, BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit CardÂ is an alternative to Slate that features no foreign transaction fees, a 20,000 point intro bonus (worth $200 when you redeem towards travel), no annual fee, 1.5 reward points for every dollar spent and a 12-month 0% intro APR.
- |
  Although Slate is a great balance transfer card, it doesn’t offer any rewards. If you’re interested in a balance transfer card that also has strong cash back rewards, take a look at the Discover it – Balance Transfer card which has a 18-month 0% intro APR on balance transfers, 5% cash back in categories that rotate quarterly (now through Dec 31st they are Amazon.com, department stores and clothing stores), 1% cash back on everything else and no annual fee (note: the card does have a 3% balance transfer fee). And as a very generous added bonus, you’ll get double cash back your first year! That means if you earn $300 in year one, Discover will give you another $300 for a total earnings of $600, which is pretty spectacular. Or if your credit history has a ding or two on it, consider Chase Freedom. Chase Freedom is available to those with just good credit (typically considered to be a credit score above 660), and itÂ features a 15-month 0% intro APR and up to 5% cash back in quarterly categories. Just in time for the holiday season those 5% categories are Amazon.com, Zappos.com, Audible.com and Diapers.com until December 31st. And Chase Freedom just raised its intro bonus to a whopping $150 after you spend just $500 in the first three months, effectively over 30% cash back on your first $500 spent.

  Should You Apply For the Slate from Chase?
- |
  Chase Slate is a very strong card and is unique in that it lets you transfer your existing balances free of charge and pay no interest for 15 months on balance transfers and purchases. We highly recommend Chase Slate, and it is our best-ranked balance transfer card. It’s particularly appealing because it’s available to those with good (rather than just excellent) credit and features the chip-and-PIN technology that’s so important when traveling overseas.There are some potential drawbacks though, including no rewards and a foreign transaction fee. If these are concerns for you, check out the above-mentioned alternatives. You can also take advantage of our free Balance Transfer Calculator to see which card is the best choice for your particular situation.

        Charged my daughter’s last three tuition payments on zero interest for 15 month credit cards … then transferred all to chase slate for fifteen months zero interest and no transfer fees… zero interest ends May 16 on slate.

        A good discussion of the positive features of the Chase card, but not the negative. I really should not call them negative, just features that make it less useful.
- |
  I have a “good” credit score, but have several credit cards and carry a total balance of $50,000. (Don’t comment with your neither a borrow nor a lender be messages, this balance came about because of businesses I owned failing.)
- |
  I pay a very high rate of interest on that $50,000 – averaging around 25% a year.  A credit card with zero transfer fees and a low APR would be wonderful. However (and I have looked into this) if I apply one of these “great” credit cards I will be lucky to get a limit of $3000. While that would help, it is not a game changer. So I am stuck in a situation in which my low interest loan (house mortgage) is getting nicely paid off, it is hard to make a dent on the high interest ones.

        Unless you are in 20% or greater, just keep the card you have. Don’t use it ever again.  Pay 2X the minimum or more each month.  Pay it down until you can pay it off totally.  Don’t bother getting a zero interest transfer, you will just be tempted to use the old card.  Also pay yourself first.  Open a savings account and put some money aside every payday, even if $10 or $20.  Do it every paycheck and don’t touch.  Watch it grow.

        WARNING – This may sound great at first, but your Credit Rating may suffer. First, you take a hit for the Inquiry against your Credit. Then your score will drop for opening a new account when one card has a high balance. I know. It happened to me. No more Balance Transfers for me.

   you admit that you were late in paying TWICE, yet you blame the bank (‘…WTG Chase !!!!…’), for charging you late fees which they told you in the application they would.!!!  You didn’t read the application you signed, and you blame the bank for your lack of responsibility and being a dumbass!!!!  I bet you vote Democrat.

        Is best to simply not have credit cards.  No one needs them.  I get around fine with my debit card and now  I actually have a real safety not fund that has a year’s salary in it, if I ever have a true emergency.  People live in debt and it has become acceptable, but if you have on major life event, there goes your house, there goes your car, there goes your life.  My suggestion, stop using credit cards, start paying off the small ones little by little.  Then start putting more money to pay off your home faster and pay off your car.  It’s amazing how big your take home pay becomes when you don’t have monthly debt payments on credit cards, a car, or even a house.

        Oh yes.  If you have plenty of money, and don’t really have much debt, Chase Slate is for you.  They will be happy to let you transfer balance owed on another card.  However, my fiance, who has a credit score of 712, and ALWAYS pays his bills on time,  applied.  He wanted to transfer the balance from his Discover card (which I think was $15,000).  They refused him because they said he had too much debt (car payment, etc.)  What’s the point if all they want is people who hardly owe anything.  Slate sounded so good until we realized that they really don’t want to help those who really could use a few months of no interest while they continue to pay off a credit card balance!!!!!

        I should have read these comments first. I am an existing customer. It sounded like it would help with some other higher rate balances.  I called Chase. No such offer for existing customers as stated in one or more of the helpful comments. I hope you all get and stay out of debt. There are better dances to be danced.

        Don’t fool yourself with balance transfers. If you can’t pay off your card balance when you get the statement don’t spend the money. You will have more money in the long run in your pocket instead of owing the money. Get cards that pay cash back or rewards with no yearly fees. Of course you have to build your credit score up to get these cards. I learned my lesson 15 years ago and have been raking in the cash rewards ever since.

        They would not lend me a dime and I have my mortgage there.   When I begged for a loan to put on a new roof at the house, all I got was $500.   My roof was $4,700.  Bad deal on this card unless you only want $500.  That is all they ever lend you.  Bank of America is worse.

  That credit score is a ruff one but there are websites out there for credit cards for all types of credit and just try to find a zero interest card that you qualify for and don’t use it for any purchases. Even if it has a high interest and maybe only 12 month transfer. At least for  12 months you will be paying principle, just don’t miss any payments and your credit will improve. In time your score will improve and you can qualify for better cards with better benefits. If you buy a car and make payments on time yous credit score will sky rocket.

        You’re in debt because of Democrats? How funny. I’m in less Debt now then i was under Bush. Anyways A zero balance transfer card like the chase card being pitched on this article is a great way to pay down debt. Even if you can not get the balance fully paid off in the term agreement what i have done is roll over the remaining balance to another zero balance credit card. I currently use a American Express for my zero interest for 18 months. I will have the balance paid off with 200 dollar payments each month by the time the term expires. The zero transfer fee is VERY huge on this card and when I decide to get another one of these types of cards i will apply.

        if you are near a Santander Bank your best bet is to go with theirs. i opened one with balance transfer for 24 months(don’t know if they still have this offer) and if you set up your automatic deposit and pay 2 bills from the account every month they deposit 20 dollars into your savings account. can’t beat that

        it is great to transfer your balance to a new card with zero interest ONLY if you promise yourself not to use the new card for any new purchases at all. Why?  Because the old debt you transfer to your new card will be used first to pay off while the new purchases you made will be last to pay off . What it means is that you will be stuck with your new balance accumulating interest charges without ability to pay it down at all until you pay off your old debt first.. it is a ZERO SUCKER TRAP! I was lucky to catch the dirty trick before accumulating too much new debt so I paid it off earlier than I liked to.. Never again!  But you can still transfer your old balance to your new zero interest card but REMEMBER NEVER TO USE THE CARD TO MAKE ANY NEW PURCHASES AT ALL!!  Use the new card to pay off your old debt at zero interest.. Don’t dally or goof around with it as zero interest will expire in 18 months or whatever it says ..   Use the time to pay off that  old debt … never use it to make new purchases !~! Pass this along to your friends  !

        I got two of these cards and transferred balances and no trouble whatsoever.  0% interest for 15 months and on was for 18 months I think.  No problems and I transferred 2500 on each card.  It will be paid off within the time period and I saved a lot of interest.  I suggest trying it.

        This was a total waste of time!!!!  I was approved for a miniscule amount which did NOTHNG for me.  So, then the account had to be closed which does not look good on a credit report.  Wish I had never done it – if you want more than $1000.00 don’t waste your time…..just wish they would have told me this up front and saved us both time.

        If you haven’t got one of these cards, you’ll have to be approved for a credit limit. If accepted, you can’t transfer an amount that’s more than 80% of that limit. When you request a balance transfer at the same time that you apply, you just have to sit back and wait for the verdict. If you’re asking to transfer $10,000 but they only approve you for a $10,000 limit, they’ll only transfer $8,000, leaving you to juggle the remainder. They base your limit on more than your credit score — household income is a big factor. And as noted, you can’t transfer balances from one card to another card with the same company. You might have to play a shell game, transferring a balance to a card with a different company then back, but if you try that, you might suddenly find that you’re ineligible for any balance transfer.

        Sorry Janny Brown, I never said not to spend money, but these credit companies are designed to MAKE MONEY from YOUR MONEY. And yes you do need credit to a degree,  Just be careful of their traps as that are designed to put you more into debt, How many companies do you know that get people out of debt?  Yes, life has some unexpected surprises, that’s why you must plan for them.  My debt was a medical emergency, but I paid that down like it was on fire, They would have eaten me alive on the interest collected.  Use them, don’t let them use you.  I hope your situation improves soon.  Been there, done that and learned.

        Offer   balance   transfer   at  0%   APR   ,  as   announced   by   some   Credit   Card   Companies   is   just   a   trap.  It’s    not   going   to   work   if   you   are   an   impulsive   spender.

        No credit card, no debt.  I own everything I have.  It forces me to save for a rainy day, and I sleep better than those with three credit cards.  But if you need a credit card, stay away from Synchony.  I made more than the regular payment and paid them off, during that time they lowered my credit limit (no problem), and when I paid them off, they closed my account (Can’t use them for reference, but they can’t erase my payment history).  They were not happy because they were not able to collect their 27% + interest.  These cards are known as “Poverty Traps”.   Instead of helping, it adds more burden and more debt.  Make a plan (Budget) and stick to it.  Don’t buy things you don’t need, you can still enjoy life. Things don’t make you happy, it may make things easier……but not happy.  Get your priorities straight  and you will be happy.

        People should be told a couple of things about Chase Slate – they do not accept complete balance transfers.  There is a limit.  So, if you are looking to transfer a large amount and try to get it down quickly – you will be disappointed.  Then, all you will get out of it is an additional credit card – which is not good.  f you have another Chase Card that has a high interest – like we do – you can’t transfer or request to receive this card to get that amount down either.  Basically, this is not to help you get out of debt, but to trap you into owing them.

        Another card to consider for balance transfer options is the LLBean Visa Card.  The rewards are great if you are a huge fan of their products.  However, for around the past year or so, they have been offering balance transfer options of 0% APR for 15 months and only a 1% balance transfer fee.  The fee goes to 3% if you choose the 0% APR for 18 months.  $50 for a %5000 balance transfer basically pays itself after the first month.

        If you want to take advantage of making a transfer for 0% interest whether there is a transfer fee or not from any Credit Card company.  Consider to pay off at an extended time 15 months for CHASE or 21 months for CITI Simplicity.  A very high interest will apply thereafter.   In the meantime, you should consider pay off new purchases on the bill.  Pay maximum to the one with highest interest. Pay minimum to the lowest one.  Think twice your shopping cart “Only buy the one you need, do not buy the one you want”.  Do this way you would get out of your debt soon.

        Chase Slate is great for parking high-interest debt. But balance transfers are slooooow, and the 60-day no-fee window closes fast. Thereafter it’s 3%, $5 minimum fee, so you would want to transfer a minimum of $167 to get the max efficiency from the fee.

   Chase Freedom has been doing 5% cash back on gas.  Speedway, formerly Hess, offers 10 cents a gallon off  when you use their Speedy Rewards card before you purchase.  Speedway is same price, cash or credit. In addition, Freedom offers another 3% cash back if you redeem your Freedom points for Lowe’s cards.  So that’s 10 cents a gallon off, plus 8% cash back  net at Lowes.

  Cap One Quicksilver is a much faster balance transfer card. They have an annual fee, I think $39 0r $49, but no transfer fee thru March 2016. I pay $200 to the Quik card, and then do 4 separate $50 balance transfers to my other cards.  Balance transfers count as a payment, so on my credit report, my $200 becomes $400 in on-time payments.

  BE SURE YOU CHECK THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ZERO-INTEREST OFFERS!

  MANY REQUIRE THAT THE BALANCE IS PAID OFF AT THE END OF THE PROMOTIONAL PERIOD, OR THEY WILL CHARGE YOU FULL INTEREST FROM DAY ONE!!

        Just close the cards  at your request so your credit doesn’t get affected. Pay extra to the ones with higher interests, pay the minimum on the others. Do this for every card, you be free in about two years, depending on how high your debt is. Never, and I mean NEVER get into one of those programs that promise to help you. They will just screw you more, like freedom debt. They don’t work with your creditors, they just have you send them money and after they got a lot, then they intend to negotiate, mean while, your cards are not getting paid, and your credit score drops below 600. I know, I did it……..

        Don Johnson, your credit score does NOT go down every time a creditor checks your credit report, only if it is done at YOUR request, such as when you apply for credit.  Many companies that have extended you credit will check your report EVERY month, but that does not affect your score at all.

        This card will only give you $1000 to start with if you have average salary so you will not be able to transfer large balances as they promise. Opening any new credit card will hurt your credit score.  So, only open this if you can get by with very small transfer or make a lot of money.

        I saw this article before (at least something similar to it).   I applied because not only are my cards maxed, but I have two that are over 29% and are going nowhere fast.  Plus I have 2 cards that charged a late fee 0 which made it an over limit fee and I have been playing THAT circle game for almost a year.  How did I get like this??  I am on SSI disability and on Medicare and last year had breast cancer surgery. after 2 lumpectomies, I ended up having a double mastectomy and phase one reconstruction.  Bills kept coming in and charged everything so that I could get the medical refund on the taxes.  I was going to used the 0% card to pay off and destroy my 2 29% cards and get back under my max on the “circle” cards.   I have a 680 credit rating and was turned down for the very reason I wanted to do this.   Is there anyway I can get this offer – a way to appeal?? BTW..  I am 3months cancer free.

        What is the interest rate after the 15 months with an 800 credit score? The answer too the person’s question about credit checks. Yes the new credit standard is every time they check your credit it goes down a little bit, Which is totally unfair!

        I have done the balance transfer dance with cards I already have that are offering a promotional balance transfer with 0%apr. My apprehension is in opening a new card just for this purpose, I read once (maybe suze orman) that every time you apply for a new credit card (even in stores on the spot) they check your credit score and that every time your score is checked it goes down tick. Does anybody know if this is true? Because if its not, I get these offers in the mail all the time, and will start using them.

        Exactly because they offered 15-months @ 0% and $0 fee for balance transfers, I applied for a Chase Slate card and was approved for $7500 (my credit score was 820 at the time). Just as promoted, I successfully transferred $7350 from another card, no fee was charged, and no interest has accrued. It’s now been 3 months and I’m 100% satisfied.

        As long as your a new card member its a great deal, but those who already have the card are left out in the cold.  Not impressive long term customer incentive to say the least so the card sits in a drawer for so long I can’t remember the last time I actually used it.

        Most cards will charge you the entire interest if not paid by the drop dead date (15 months in this case).

  I did a thing when I built my house. I had many credit cards (generally which I didn’t use much and always paid them off). I had many offers of transfer balance, so I parlayed those offers into financing my construction. I created a spreadsheet to remind me when I needed to pay them  off. I would often pay one off w/ another and then sometimes back again. Ultimately, I paid them all off with my equity I gained from a house I sold and ultimately the rest when I sold the house I was living in and everything. I played their game to the hilt … and did OK … BUT … you have to manage those balance transfers very carefully. 0% and no balance transfer is key.

        I applied and was approved with my good credit. The only problem was I wanted to transfermy total debt of $5000 and they would only allow me to transfer $1700. So I canceled the whole thing.

        I would love to transfer my balance. I presently have a Discover Card with a loan shark interest rate. Despite having  a perfect payment record, I have been told for YEARS there is no better rate available. They won’t even help or tell me why it is at that rate.

        Hi @Cathy,
- |
  The Chase Slate card we detail on this page has NO balance transfer fee if you transfer your balance in the first 60 days. It’s possible you transferred your balance after this 60 day period. However, the Chase Slate we discuss in this blog post and link to has absolutely no balance transfer fees (prior to the 60 day cut off).

        I agree with many of the people on here.  My husband passed away, I became disabled and now we/I  have enormace credit card debt.  Because of “LIFE” happening and having to pay bills I’m in debt.  I’ve never missed a payment, or had any other problems but now that I really need assistance no one is willing to give a person a chance.   I can’t believe that if you have always had excellent credit scores until “Life” happened it doesn’t make a difference.  Excellent past history doesn’t mean a thing, one one will  give me a chance to get my life back together again.    It’s sad that the USA will literally take a persons home if illness or death cause unforeseen expenses.   I probably shouldn’t say this but… Of course, if I came from another country I would get the medical for free.  Then I wouldn’t been in such a sad place.  To all the others in this situation, let’s pray for each other.  Nothing else seems to help.

        There is only one way to get out of credit card debt and that is to quit using them. Transferring and consolidating debt is never a good idea. Credit card companies are not in business to help you get out of debt.

        I USED CHASE AND AS A LONG TIME CUSTOMER HAD NO PROBLEM TRANSFERING 9,000 FROM TWO ACCTS TO CAHSE.  I PAID 800 PER MONTH AND HAD IT PAID OFF IN THE ZERO INTEREST PERIOD.  I HAVE SINCE USED THE CHECKS THEY ISSUE EVERY MONTH AND SAME GREAT DEAL ON THEM.  I JUST STAY AT $800 PER MONTH PAYMENT AND THE AMOUNT GETS PAID OFF BEFORE IT GETS ANY INTEREST MONEY !  I NOW LIKE CHASE THE BEST !  EVEN THEIR NORMAL INTEREST IS BETTER THAN MY U.S. BANK WILL GIVE ME !  I MAY BE SWITCHING MY DIRECT DEPOSIT SOON AND MAKING CHASE MY HOME BANK.  I HAVE A CHASE SLATE CARD ACCOUNT !

        I’ll never fall for this again.  They all promise this and when it comes time to transfer an existing balance, they decline indicating the amount is too high – stating…you are a new customer to them so you have no payment history with them.  So then, you’re left juggling two credit cards because they generally only allow a balance transfer of half the amount, if that.   I think it’s false advertisement and Chase Bank is horrible to do business with.  I’ve heard a lot of complaints from friends and family.

        Pay off your credit cards by all means but you should not necessarily close them down. Your credit score is partly based on what proportion of your available credit your are actually using. If you have, say $10,000 total in credit card limits but you only use $500 a month which you pay off before the due date your score will go up.

        I am an existing Chase customer with 2 other Chase credit cards, but I was able to qualify for the Slate card last year and used it to pay down some debt.  The only thing is, you cant transfer balances from other Chase cards to this one.

        Chase card is good to keep as a emergency fund. Once you used it for over thousand dollars, you won’t escape from it. They wait till you make one late payment to increase the interest rate to 29% or 31%. There was a time I had 31% for my card balance.What kind of business was that? Recenly I called them and requested a lower interest rate since my credit score is now very close to 700. My request was denied. I think my chase card interest rate right now is 26% now.  I transfered the balance to Citi card which I have 21 months 0% interest and thereafter 15%. No late fee and no panelty APR (29%-31% like chase gave me). Just one time 3% for balance transfer which was something very little compare to Chase charged me over many years. Thank you Citi card. (I just got it a week ago)

        They’re banking on you not paying off the balance within 15 months.  I have fair credit, was approved for $5,000, but I noticed my APR goes up to over 20% after the 15 months.  My number one financial goal is to be sure that my Slate card is completely paid off before the Introductory 0% expires.

        I have had a SLATE card for many years. After my husband passed away, my income was suddenly $4,000 a month less. This really screwed up my debt to earnings ratio. There fore most of my credit cards were cancelled by the credit card companies. Ever though I didn’t have a balance on them. SLATE was the only one that continued to give me credit. I am so grateful. I always like to have a little credit available in case of an emergency.

        Chase Slate is definately a good card for most people with a good credit history , the sad thing is that most people in this country that need to transfer balances don’t have a very stellar or even good credit (most of the time below 700) that will not be approved for this card .  the things to consider if u are not fortunate to get this card  that there are other  options for u . use cards that u already have ( so u don’t get a hit on ur credit to open a new one ) that already offer promos on the existing card , even if u pay a 3% fee to bring a bal ance that u have at 15.00% it still going  going to save u 12% annually , and if the rate is for more then 1 year the better savings you will have . If the card you use for the transfers is an existing account and doesn’t have the 0% on purchases don’t use the card for purchases keep it separate . with the new credit card act passed in 2010 by President Obama a default Apr can only be applied to new purchases not the existing bal on the act , also with all credit cards due to new laws banks can no longer take away your 0% if u are late with ur payment ( it’s not  a special feature of the slate cards its the law to all cards ). so has a consumer study your options , figure out if the cards u already have offer promos , fees, find out what is ur annual % rate u are paying … do the math , if the  0% is for a year or more and u are paying more then what the  transaction fee is … don’t be afraid  it’s only money after all….

        Don’t fall for this marketing scam.  I tried to take advantage of this offer and here’s what they don’t tell you.  The only way you are going to get approved for balance transfer is if you have an available credit line that matches the total amount of the debt you are trying to transfer.  in other words, if you think they will approve the transfer with your current debt to income ratio, it’s not going to happen.  What they will do is simply approve and send you yet another credit card with an available balance only as large as your remaining available credit at an astronomical percentage rate.  I did not need another card and the way they process this is like doubling down on your debt.  I had to make several calls to cancel the credit card I did not ask for.

        TO MR WILLIAM FREY – I am just another consumer with a small business (DBA) like you, and I wanted to let you know that (shockingly) the bank you bank with as a small business owner (in your case Chase) will now rarely give you a credit card (its some inside rule they have especially since you have other credit cards with them, it puts their bank in a position to bear too great a risk of detault since they (Chase) would be holding too great a percentage of your total debt (sounds like 100% of your debt is with Chase) — so you need to apply to a non-Chase credit card (like maybe one of the other cards listed in this article or wherever – just not Chase) – and 2nd, you should be applying multiple times for a credit card because each time you apply the bank will do a hard credit pull which tanks your credit (FICO) score — from the bank’s perspective they see you as desperate for credit (I know its idiotic but they’re banks!) — WHAT YOU NEED TO DO is STOP applying for credit cards — wait 6 mos to 9 mos before you apply for ANY  credit card (or ANY debt always wait 6-9 mos between applications) — then apply for a non-Chase credit card.   However in general the credit card companies have become extremely tight about issuing anyone a new credit card.    I would try to go to a  Credit Union to get rid of that 27% credit card by rolling it over to one of their cards which are almost always a much lower rate like 10 – 16% which makes a huge difference.    I feel your pain, but you’re only hurting your own credit score by applying multiple times within a 6 mos period (much less a 4 week period).   The way to beat the card companies is to understand their game, and beat them at it.  Good luck.

        Concur with other posters. Considering closing my account as the interest rate is exorbitant and,  even with good FICO apparently is “unadjustable” .  There are other companies with better customer service / response out there.

  Never carry this card with me,  never ever carry a balance  and use it very rarely

        My credit rating is over 700 and when I applied I was also rejected. My balance transfer is approximately $5000. I think Chase cherry picks and just throws out these teasers without really intending to approve but a very small number of applications.

        This will be my 8th submission, the other 7 were rejected. I have been a Chase client with two checking accounts and a DBA account for over ten years,  I have not been late on any of my credit cards or mortgage payments for ten years, yet my two Slate Cards remain at 27% interest while my Capital One credit card is below 9% interest.    When I called to have this reduced, I was told Chase is not offering rate reductions at this time and I was given no information as to how I could get the rate reduced. I am aware someone is reading this information or negative statements would not have been deleted. I am therefor requesting  someone look into these high rates ASAP.

        the slate card sounds nice but after the 15 months the intrest is high so if you cannot pay off your full amount in the 15 months i wouldn’t change to them. just saying.

        You can not transfer from one Chase card to another, so if you are carrying a balance on one Chase card you can not transfer to a new Chase account with a lower interest rate.

        This is wrong.

  ” With Slate you pay absolutely nothing to transfer your money”
- |
  You aren’t transferring money, you’re transferring debt, negative money.  Better to not use Credit Cards to buy things you can’t afford.  It can be a struggle at first, but after a while you get used to living and giving within your means.
- |
  A better choice is to get a Debit card and use it to do your purchases, when you run out of money, you’re out of money.  That’s what your rainy day fund is for.

        Each and every one of you that has a Lowe’s credit card needs to review the statement very closely. We were charged a fee (If you become disabled) the fee was more than our monthly payment. We never signed up for this program and over the years it cost us over $1,900 dollars. Be very diligent…watch what they are charging you.

        Pay off you credit cards as soon as you can.  Don’t use them any more.   Use cash and pay no interest.  Don’t buy things for which you have no money.  Do not play with fire. (credit cards or other debt)  Chase is waiting for you to slip up and then charge their FEES.

        Nobody ever became financially successful by how they used their credit cards.  They achieved financial independence by NOT using credit cards.  If you’re not spending less than you’re earning today, what do you plan to live on when you retire?  Please don’t say that you’re going to rely entirely upon Social Security benefits; if it still exists in 20 years, it sure won’t provide enough for you to live on with dignity.
- |
  Read Thomas Stanley’s book, “The Millionaire Next Door” if you want legitimate insight into how succeed financially.  Spoiler:  It doesn’t involve using credit cards or borrowing money from other people.

  If you don’t know the difference between edible and eligible then you have no business with a credit card!

  Pay your balance off monthly, then you have no problems.  If you need a loan go to a bank or Credit Union, their rates are far better than a CC.

        This NOT the way to resolve large credit card debt on a number of cards. The best way is through debt laddering (also called debt stacking), a process in which one commits to pay each month the present total of the individual payments, usually paying off first the card with the highest interest rate and applying the amount to the next card, and so on. Your local financial adviser can help you set it up..

        It is a good card just pay it off before the introductory offer expires. BUT that’s not the issue. You have to qualify for the amount you want to transfer..what usually happens is you try and transfer say 10K and they only approve 5K….so don’t expect to transfer a large amount..

        What it is wrong with all of you guys. I had 72 open accounts and when I did find out I had no choice to close at least half of them. My credit rating went down but after 4-5 months went up again and I did the same thing again and today my FICO rating it is 788  which it is the highest that ever I had. I never pay interest of any of my credit cards. I do follow the offers and paying attention with all of them. Today I do have 21-21 credit cards but only 7-8 have a balance at 0% for 15 to 18 months offers. Good luck.

        If you have the misfortune to a history of chapter 7 Bankruptcy Chase like me that will stay on you record for at least 10 years Chase will not approve you for this card. After doing some research with the Bank – this is only for those with extremely good credit to  begin with already. If you have good to excellent credit then you don’t need this card to get Zero 0% APR. You can get this with most other banks. Its a scam guys – When ever something is too good to be true its a scam.

        Like several others have commented above, I also clear my credit card bills every month and don’t accumulate credit. However, I use my card as much as possible for my essential household purchases. In this situation I have really enjoyed my Citibank Premier Miles Card (Master Card). I get substantial discounts on flight tickets and the procedure to use the earned miles is very simple.

        The best way to avoid huge credit card debt is my limiting your purchases to only what you can entirely pay off monthly.  Other than that if you want something more expensive save the money first and pay cash.  I am not a wealthy man but at the age of 74 I  have no credit card debt and have very seldom paid any interest in my life.  When I say I am not wealthy I mean it.  The most I ever earned in one year was $30,000.

        My granny had this and it was fine, but when she stopped using it so much and had a zero balance she was charged extortionate “service fees”, including for two years after her death.  In the end, I had to go in person to a Chase office in a different State to prove she had died, and they still charged fees to the card for another year.  And to cover the fees they over-drew her checking account, which held up probate.  Disgraceful.

        I  currently have a Chase Freedom card.  I am paying it off as well as I can.  My limit is $15,000 and I am close to the limit.  Problem is my now ex-wife and her boyfriend charged most of the amount and I am now stuck with it (maritial  assets)  Is there any way they can increase my limits until the final settlement when I will have enough to pay it off?

        I am not in the market for a different credit card, but the idea that not having a good FICO scores does not matter is wrong.  A strong FICO score will help when it comes to your automobile and home insurance rates as almost all companies take this in consideration as a factor in determining a rate for any individual.  It is not just a matter of kind of auto and driving record anymore.

        I have been doing this for a while transferring to zero percent to pay off debt …it really works!  I just got the chase slate and it is true no transfer fees  and no interest for 15 months.  I sets mine to auto pay the amount to be sure that the debt is paid in that 15 month period!

        People that worship at the altar of the Great FICO Score are delusional; there’s absolutely no value in having a high score.  So what, you have a high FICO score?  That just means you’re good at giving money to banks and lenders.  I seriously doubt if any legitimate millionaires even have a FICO score; years ago they learned to live within their means, paid cash, and invested (starting with small amounts) wisely.  It certainly isn’t rocket science.

  Nobody ever became rich by how they used their credit cards.  They became wealthy by NOT using credit cards.  If you’re not spending less than you’re earning today, what do you plan to live on when you retire?  Please don’t say that you’re going to rely entirely upon Social Security benefits; if it still exists in 20 years, it sure won’t provide enough for you to live on with dignity.

  Read Thomas Stanley’s book, “The Millionaire Next Door” if you want legitimate insight into how succeed financially.  Spoiler:  It doesn’t involve using credit cards or borrowing money from other people.

        A significant part of your credit rating is based on how long you’ve had credit wit h your current accounts. The longer the better.  Card hopping brings your credit score down. This only makes sense if you truly are doing it with the intent to pay it off.

        I have paid down a great amount of my debt using a credit counseling service.  I have interest charges on each debt (granted lower than the original interest rates), and I pay them $35.00 per month.

  Could I put the individual accounts on this card so I can save interest money and monthly fees from the service?   It seems this would save me money and allow me to pay off the rest of my debt even faster.

  the transfers have to be done in the first 60 days after the act is open to be able to have the fee waived, the 0% APR is good for 21 months ( not 60 days) . Balance Transfers can help someone pay down their credit card debt even with a fee because if u are paying a 14% interest on a balance and u are paying 3%  to trf to a 0%  for 12 months it would be like reducing your APR from to 3%… duhhhhh obvious savings . be smart and make it work for you .

        I have a Chase/Slate Visa card which I have had for a long time and I know this because it has changed names at least three times since I had it.  I also have a Juniper Master Card which I have also had for a long time.  A few months ago when I was paying my bills I was disturbed at the amount of interest these cards are charging.  The Chase card has a little under $2,000.00 on it.  The Juniper card has a little over $3,000.00 on it.  I called both credit card companies to ask about lowering my interest rate since I have been a long time customer and I always pay my bill on time.  Juniper took a few seconds and looked at my account and lowered it on the phone by 5% and also took away my interest charges for that months bill!!  A few days later I got a letter from them that explained that after reviewing my account they lowered it another 2%!!  When I called Slate, where I have the lower amount due, they told me they could not do anything for me.  I even told them I would close the account and put the credit on a different credit card with a lower interest rate.  They still chose to do nothing.  Currently, the interest on the Slate card is 25.24%.  The interest on the Juniper card is 14.99% and if I were to transfer the balance from my Slate to the Juniper…  balance transfers are also 14.99%.  Which credit card do you think I’ll be  patronizing?

        It’s not mentioned anywhere in the article, but Slate is a Visa.  It used to be a Mastercard until Chase stopped doing Mastercards in early 2015.  It’s a decent card to cut out interest while paying off the card.  I had one while I was carrying a balance due to cost overruns while renovating our 2nd house before selling it, but after I paid it off I switched to Chase Freedom Visa to get the quarterly 5% cash-back deals (5% of gasoline July-Sept, 5% off Amazon.com Oct-Dec., etc. 1% off everything else) and opened a Bank of America Cash Rewards Mastercard (3% off gasoline, 2% off groceries, 1% off all else) because I want on of each major card and want to maximize my cash-back.

  To me it is not good to be switching credit cards continuously.  the best thing to avoid interest is to pay your balance each month, we do and never pay interest.  We use a rewards card and use the rewards to buy discounted gift cards.  Our other chioce is the finacial institutionof our choice offers a higher interst rate if we use the debit card the request number of times monthly.  We try to keep our crdit balance at less than $1K/mo to make it easier to pay.  Hence we cut ourselves off near the billing date.  (Sometimes needs come up and it is not possible to use a lower balance, but we STILL pay the balance each month).  That is the BEST way to pay no interest.  If you need a loan got to your bank or Credit Union and get a much lower interst rate there.

        To add to my previous comment: The best ones are also those credit cards that besides the 0% on purchases for a long period of time the even give you cash back, imagine making purchases that will have to make no matter what paying cash. Get a card (if you qualify of course) and use the card, you get money back to use as you please.

        Yes, it really helps to get an offer for a credit card with the 0% for a long time and even better if there is no balance transfer fee. but in order to make  use of that offer you must make sure to by the time the offer ends you will be able to pay off whatever money you took from it. I is not like borrowing money and never pay back. If you are about financing be careful.
- |
  I have use this kinds of credit card offers for more than 15 years with very good results, even if I have to pay a 3% transaction fee, (which most of the time I do not) is worth it, you can use that money to buy a car,  remodel your home  or invest it to avoid interest on a loan . I have used as much as 4 credit card offers at the same time  for the down payment on a house, fix the house and then put it for rent then I start saving the money to pay it back some of the cards ( I also work on the side) when you pay the card back you will usually get another offer to use the money again or   if I get another new card offer I just transfer the  balances I have to the new one for another 12 or 18 months.
- |
  As I said, do not think that is like money you borrow from your parents or brother and will be forget about it, do not borrow from anyone if you do not make a plan in how will you pay it back.

        Yes, it really helps to get an offer for a credit card with the 0% for a long time and even better if there is no balance transfer fee. but in order to make  use of that offer you must make sure to by the time the offer ends you will be able to pay off whatever money you took from it. I is not like borrowing money and never pay back. If you are about financing be careful.

  I have use this kinds of credit card offers for more than 15 years with very good results, even if I have to pay a 3% transaction fee, (which most of the time I do not) is worth it, you can use that money to buy a car,  remodel your home  or invest it to avoid interest on a loan . I have used as much as 4 credit card offers at the same time  for the down payment on a house, fix the house and then put it for rent then I start saving the money to pay it back some of the cards ( I also work on the side) when you pay the card back you will usually get another offer to use the money again or   if I get another new card offer I just transfer the  balances I have to the new one for another 12 or 18 months.

  As I said, do not think that is like money you borrow from your parents or brother and will be forget about it, do not borrow from anyone if you do not make a plan in how will you pay it back.

        Slate only offers no transfer fee within the first 60 days after you receive it.  I took out a Slate Card just in case I needed to transfer a balance.  Sure enough about 3 months later I started a balance transfer and finalizing it, a fee was added.  I called Slate and was told I had to make the balance transfer within the first 60 days.  This is definitely a bait and switch deal and I had to pay 3% transfer fee.

        I have one card with a balance of about 1800.  I have been paying 100 a month, but of course, it’s not going down too quick!  I agree with ‘don’t buy it if you can’t afford it’, but in my case, most of my cc debts have been for major car repairs and medical stuff.  I just can’t get ahead!  (Single mom, 1 income).  I just keep plugging along.

        Having taken advantage of the 0% interest/0% transfer in the past, it is a very helpful tool – IF and ONLY IF you stop charging stuff. Make the transfer, STOP USING THE CARDS, and pay down your debt. And keep it that way. I am currently unemployed, and can’t quite follow my own hard-learned advice, but as soon as cash flow happens again, the card will be paid off (a good portion of the debt is my sister’s, which she in turn owes me).

        The only thing that sucks with Chase Credit Card is that when you set up automatic payments you cannot setup to pay more than the minimum payment. So you have to be vigilant and make an extra online payment if you want the balance to decrease timely.

        For those like Ed & DL, who advocate destroying credit cards and use only cash, do not know exactly how and what do credit cards work for us. First of all, we can only cut up our cards if our cards are all paid up, i.e. there’s no balance at all to pay, in which case, we shouldn’t even be in this conversation at all. Second, for those with only enough funds to pay for our monthly expenses and not enough to pay down debt, then it’s essential that we pay down our debt first and cut back on our expenses, for as long as it takes to pay off our balances. Once that’s done, then we must always ensure that we settle our credit card balances in full every month (which is what I told my grown-up kids that they must do), to build up our credit score and obtain the lowest rates and best terms whenever we need to purchase anything through financing. America is the only country in the world where we can purchase a house and/or a car without having cash to pay for them, provided our credit score is high and our credit history is great, which I recently did for my son and my daughter, who bought a house and a car each (not at the same time but spread over 6-months interval for each purchase) without any cash (which they couldn’t believe) but using the purchase checks from the banks’ credit cards. I’ve got 3 cards with more than $20K each and they keep sending me these purchase checks, which I used to provide funds for my son’s closing costs (although I had to pay 2% fee and 3% fee for two of them and the third was free but all 0% APR for 16months). I told them to buy the houses for less than $150K (if they’re going to live in them for at least 5yrs), instead of paying rising rent on their apts, and build up their equity, so that they can purchase another house in future. The bottomline is that, whatever funds we have every month should be used to pay down our balances and then, charge everything we spend to our credit cards, BUT ensuring that we spend less every month than what we pay, i.e. our total balances must be reduced every month, so that we can save our monthly interests and pay off our balances. There’re two things always to take note of, viz. (1) pay more to cards with the highest interest and/or lowest balance first; (2) if our credit score is very good, we can apply for the 0% cards every six months (with more than 12 months 0% APR) and transfer our highest interest balance to this new card. If the new card doesn’t have enough credit limit to do much good, then use 50% to transfer balances and charge the other 50% for your new expenses (avoid maxing it) and make sure that we pay at least 25% of our monthly balances, so that we’ll have enough credit for the following month’s expenses and after 3 to 6 months, the bank will increase the credit limit on our new card, without asking for any increase, which is usually 20% at least (which won’t happen if we use the full limit to transfer balances because banks must earn money from our purchases for that to happen). My son’s Slate card increased his credit limit from $3K to $6K because I told him not to use more than 20% every month and pay the balance in full, which also helped him to pay for the renovation expenses for his new house. I hope this helps, but please seek clarification if in doubt. God bless.

If the new card doesn’t have enough credit limit to do much good, then use 50% to transfer balances and charge the other 50% for your new expenses (avoid maxing it) and make sure that we pay at least 25% of our monthly balances, so that we’ll have enough credit for the following month’s expenses and after 3 to 6 months, the bank will increase the credit limit on our new card, without asking for any increase, which is usually 20% at least (which won’t happen if we use the full limit to transfer balances because banks must earn money from our purchases for that to happen). My son’s Slate card increased his credit limit from $3K to $6K because I told him not to use more than 20% every month and pay the balance in full, which also helped him to pay for the renovation expenses for his new house. I hope this helps, but please seek clarification if in doubt. God bless.

        1.I like Chase. 2.If you ain’t got the cash to pay for it You can’t afford it 3.Never go into debt for consumables (things that you purchase,enjoy and are gone.4. The first step in getting out of a debt hole is STOP DIGGING. 5.Credit is lazy man’s wealth. 6. Debt is dangerous and destructive in tangible and intangible ways. 7.If things are out of control the first step is GET REAL.That means destroy the cards,close the accounts and start making payments. 8.Rough rule of thumb : If your minimum monthly payment is say $300 or whatever. . .keep paying THAT SAME AMOUNT every month and you will be out of debt.9.When you cut your cards and close the accounts your finances will hit the wall,work with what you got to pay rent food utilities and work out payment arrangements on the debts. 10.These are all real lessons learned the hard way,things I did and it worked and I had bills and responsibilities too. . .Get out of debt it takes years start today !

        Doesn’t anyone ever think how much they pay in cc interest over the year?  If you can’t pay for it in cash don’t buy it. With  .$4000 in debts why go on a European vacation. Stay home and get out of debt. By the way the U.S. is backward in chip cards.

        I’ve had a Chase MC  for many years; and they’ve never disappointed me. Several times they have notified me (at my own direction) of expenditures over $500.00 (I set the dollar amount for the notification) and I have had a few disputes with merchants; every single time Chase has backed me up once I provided them with documentation to support my argument.  Great card. If  they denied someone’s credit, I would imagine Chase had a reason such as, they had poor credit.

        My wife and I both requested this card in December prior to Christmas 2014. I was able to transfer $7,200 of my debt to it, and she was only able to transfer $3,000. I’ve had Chase bank years ago, never had any issues. Since acquiring the card, I never used it. This past week, I had received an email at 630am regarding use on my card. Somebody had gained my credit card number and tried to use it in California for $18. All in all, I was happy for what Chase did for me.

  In conclusion, I have ZERO complaints about this bank. I’m seeing this article pop up more and more.

  much lower than credit card rates. If you don’t own yet get your credit rating to

        TO: Christin Wilson, I have never written the note you suggest when making an
- |
  extra payment and every time the extra payment was applied to the balance.
- |
  This goes for credit cards and mortgage. The cost of financing a balance by making
- |
  a payment just under $1 or $2 of the total due can be expensive since the entire
- |
  balance will be subject to a finance charge. I prefer to pay off some of my cards in full and
- |
  pay down any zero interest balance transfer payments slowly.
- |
  The rest of your comment is great advice.

        A few years ago, I opened a Chase Slate card and requested $14,000 transfer.  Was allowed a $4,900 transfer with 13 months at 0% interest, 0% transfer fee.  Even transferring that amount helped a lot.  I paid it off faithfully every month – sometimes the minimum, but most of the time much more.  I paid it all off (including additional purchases) fully before the deadline.  I had no trouble with Chase – although I had read there could be.  I did all transactions online and made payments by bank transfer from my checking account at another bank.

  I would recommend the Chase Slate card.  I also recommend with any card, at any bank, keep a frequent check online and keep good records of payments.

        I have a better idea. Pay off your balance every month and pay NO interest and get a Citi   Bank cash back card that pays you 2% of your purchases every month.

        Chase is NOT to be trusted.  They cranked up my interest sky-high under circumstances that would be illegal today.  I had a hell of a time getting that millstone off my neck.  They’ll never get another dime from me.

        Chase Bank can NOT be trusted.  I transferred a large balance to Chase to gain a ZERO Percent interest rate until the balance was paid off.   Afterwards, Chase changed the minimum percent payment due from two percent of balance to FIVE percent of the balance due.

        I have the Slate card and so far no problems. I did balance transfers, no problems and the full credit line was available for transfers. If you are having problems with transfers, call them. I wouldn’t cancel a credit card, unless there is a ridiculous yearly fee and low credit limit. Having a credit card and using it responsibly is the best way to go. I filed bankruptcy in 2003. It took 11 years before I got approved for credit. I did have one card, Orchard Bank, now CreditOne. I used it monthly on Arrowhead water delivery, I never paid it off each month, just shy of paying it off, say $1.00-$2.00 left each month. It showed, once my bankruptcy was off of my record, that I was in good standing for around 7 years. If you have a credit card and don’t use it, no good credit is reported. If you pay a credit card bill off completely each month, again, no help. But a monthly credit, showing that it’s being used and is in good standing, that’s what creditors want to see. Also, if you’ve had a credit card for a while and say had a late payment and your interest went up, wait about six months and then contact company and ask if the negative can be removed. You can also call to request a credit line increase. You can also call and ask if your interest rate can be lowered. Another thing, if you start getting loads of credit offers, do your homework on the company, their reputation, find message boards or BBB reviews. Also, if you apply for a credit card, it dings your credit score, even if approved. So don’t apply for a bunch of cards around the same time, space them apart because this also doesn’t look good on your credit report. Most importantly, don’t go and buy things just because you have a credit card with a $5,000 limit or more or less. Use your credit cards within your financial means, just because you have that credit card with that limit, doesn’t mean you go on a shopping spree. Lastly, make more than your monthly payment, double it or more if you can. If you pay by check (who uses checks anymore? Right) send a letter with each payment, and I mean every single payment that says “Please Note: ALL extra monies sent with this payment are to be put towards the principle of the loan.”. Do this with car, mortgage or other types of payments/loans that you have, including credit cards, that have interest rates. This pays down your principle faster and with much less interest. For instance, I purchased a used car in 2008, sticker price was $8,000. Add taxes, insurance and a 72 month loan, total price for that used car after 72 months, $18,000. I made double payments usually, sometimes triple payments. Occasionally I could only pay the monthly payment of $250.00. I got the car in late 2008, first payment due January 2009. I would have finished paying off this car in January this year if I just made the monthly payment. Instead, I had it paid off in just under 2 years. I had the option to make payments online, I didn’t because the online payments do not give you an option of saying “Any and all extra monies sent are to be placed on the principal of the loan.” What would have cost me $18,000 if I’d made minimum payments monthly, cost me around $10,500 total. I saved approximately $7,500. You do the math guys. If you have credit cards that you pay online and have opted out of paper statements, change that now, insist on paper statements (unless you can print out the payment slip from the statement (you can on many) and even if you cannot double a payment, maybe you can add $5-$20 to your minimum payment due, sent a check and EVERY SINGLE PAYMENT, add a hand written note “To Whom it May Concern, Any and all extra monies sent are to be placed towards the Principal of the loan. Sincerely, (enter your name here)”. Take a picture of the Statement your check and your note. I’ve even written on the front of the check itself those same words, but it can be hard to read sometimes, I wrote it in and/or under the “note” section of the check, but paper is better. Get a small notebook 5″ x 3″ or close to it. Good Luck! I wish you all the best of luck. I hope that I have helped some of you out.

        Slate is a great card.  Even after you’ve been with them for a while the balance transfer fee is only 2% for a 15 month 0% interest.  It’s a great card for a small business to own. It allows me to float some payments in a month when business may be down.

        Only problem with doing this is your credit score takes a big hit. It seems like the credit bureau likes to lower your score even when your trying to make it look better. YOU lose points if you sneeze.

        I applied for a Chase Slate credit card so I could do a balance transfer to the account. Well, I was approved for a credit card but it was for a measly $800 credit limit. ??? I was shocked by such a low credit line. The next smallest line of credit that I have is $3000.
- |
  I almost didn’t transfer anything over and just close the account instead, but I decided what the heck, with no balance transfer fee, I might as well transfer money over and use the card until the 0% interest runs out, then close the card. So next month, when the card is paid off in full (a month before the 0% interest rate runs out) I will go ahead and close the account. An $800 credit line just isn’t worth worrying about.

  YMMV.

- "      I applied for a Chase Slate credit card so I could do a balance transfer
  to the account. Well, I was approved for a credit card but it was for a measly $800
  credit limit. ??? I was shocked by such a low credit line. The next smallest line
  of credit that I have is $3000. \n"
- |
  I almost didn’t transfer anything over and just close the account instead, but I decided what the heck, with no balance transfer fee, I might as well transfer money over and use the card until the 0% interest runs out, then close the card. So next month, when the card is paid off in full (a month before the 0% interest rate runs out) I will go ahead and close the account. An $800 credit line just isn’t worth worrying about.

  YMMV.

        Don’t do it.  I was approved and transferred my a high interest rate credit card balance to Chase Slate – it was supposed to be zero interest for 1 year.  After 3 months they started tacking on interest – when I called them they said “oh you didn’t qualify for the zero interest for 1 year”.  Now I’m stuck!

        When I read the comments from people regarding their negative experiences with credit they usually fall into one of these categories:
- |
  1 a person with poor credit doesn’t get the deal they think they should.  If you have poor credit (usually indicative of a bad credit score) you will not get the deals that are touted.
- |
  2 a person who signs up for something and it turns out to be something different.  The laws regarding disclosure for credit card agreements and loans are very specific and set up for the overly ignorant.  If you read the print (not the fine print) the print, you’ll know the deal.  Most people don’t do this and then they blame the creditor for their failure to read and understand what they are signing up for.
- |
  3 a person who buys on credit what they shouldn’t.  If you don’t have the means to pay something off within a reasonable time, and its not a real asset, then don’t use credit.  Otherwise, you will be in an endless cycle of debt.  I understand how hard this is but it requires living below your means and waiting until you have the funds.  Not a concept practiced in this country.

        Slate is a bunch of bull.  I have one in my wallet.  I maybe used it once when I needed a roof repair of $1,200 and later when the whole roof was falling apart, Slate didn’t help me.   As a matter of fact, they only would lend me $500 and had to pay it back in 2 months for the repair.  And, I have had my mortgage at Chase for years.   They wouldn’t even give me a home improvement loan.  Wouldn’t a roof be an improvement if it was falling apart?   I finally went to Enerbank and they lent me $3,500, no interest, for one year, same as cash.  Steer clear of this card.   Check out all the small print.  Bogus card.  It is good for nothing.

        I applied for this card but was only offered $3,500 credit limit.  I have another card with almost zero balance and $20,000 credit limit that is offering a similar deal but with a 1% transfer fee.  Chases is an ugly company to deal with from my experience so I have no intention of using their product.

        You need to be careful with Barclay. I applied and was accepted for a Barclay card offering 0% for 14 months. It turned out to be 14 days, apparently. The first 1/2 month had no interest, but the next month had interest charged at 24.99%. I would NEVER have applied for nor accepted this rate had I known. They were supposed to email me with the terms, which I should have printed before I completed the application, but never did. I also never received them in the mail. I was never provided them until after my second billing. This turned out to be a real bait and switch. I cancelled the card and will pay it off asap.

        I’m helping my boyfriend to consolidate, and I read all about this card. He decided to use this card to transfer a balance.

  Please know: There is no way to set this card up on any kind of automatic payment system. I understand they’re running a business and they want to doc you every time you slip up, but it seemed a little obvious. Also, when they raised the balance, they messed up the transfer, so he had to make a much larger initial payment than was originally arranged. He won’t be using it beyond the current balance. Kinda unimpressed for what it is.

        I applied for, and was approved, a slate credit card specifically so I could transfer a balance from a different credit card I actually used to pay for elective surgery that was not coved by insurance. If you use your credit wisely and plan for these types of things credit cards and $0 balance transfer offers etc. are a helpful tool. My credit score is 800+ but I still have credit cards that have 20% and higher interest rates. If I use them I pay them off…

        I applied for, and was approved, a slate credit card specifically so I could transfer a balance from a different credit card I actually used to pay for elective surgery that was not coved by insurance. If you use your credit wisely and plan for these types of things credit cards and $0 balance transfer offers etc. are a helpful tool. My credit score is 800+ but I still have credit cards that have 20% and higher interest rates. If I use them I pay them off…

        To the small business owner: in part I agree with you but your “oh poor small business owner” meme is pathetic.  If your customers won’t pay the extra 5% that you tack on for the credit card charge then post a cash/credit price notice on the store’s door or inform the customer at the register. There are plenty of us “small business owner’s” (me included) that have found ways to adjust to the on going slump in the economy. The first is to notify your state’s Small Business Association of your need for representation in Congress. Then YOU need to get out and protest, organize and vote for a progressive candidate that realizes that America runs on small business enterprise and HOLD THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE! Too often we think this party or that party is our salvation. Well what does it feel like now that you have been saved? Banks own this country when it should be “WE THE PEOPLE”. WE are the government but instead we have allowed our elected to turn government into BIG business and THEY make all the money and never have to pay for credit because we the small business and taxpaying middle class subsidize them in lots of ways with our tax money. You’ve drank the “kool-aid” and don’t like the after taste. Well poor you…go out and do something about it.

        who pays for the zero interest credit cards? who pays for points? the banks are peddling free credit cards and the average consumer has no understanding that small business owners are paying 3 to 5 points tax on each transaction. just so someone can earn “rewards” or “cash back”.  how do you like paying 10% more for merchandise and services to cover the costs for taking cards in the first place. Wake up people. If you want to get out of credit card trouble, file bankruptcy and you can intentionally hurt your chances and teach yourself to get off the credit. Have we all become so lazy and ignorant? There’s no such thing as a free lunch. I would know because I own a small business,

        I also had a Chase account  at one time, and they kept changing the interest rate….when you get the card if the rate is going to change every month that should be disclosed.

  Several have said Pay it Off. Not everyone can do that, most do not have a few thousand just sitting around…I used to have just 1 card and didnt use it…my husband was out of work for 2 years. so we had to use cards to pay for things like repairing furnace etc

        I used it 5 yrs ago and didn’t pay any fees or interest  for 3 yrs’ Worked so good, after I was cleared of debt, used it to transfer my daughters debt from another card. Together we probably saved around 3-4 thousand bucks. The trick is not to use the card for purchases you don’t need. But if you must use it, your payment goes to the highest charging fee. No problems whatso ever

        I read about the Chase Slate card all the time.    In talking with their rep, I got the impression that they don’t investigate credit for the initial application.  They just verify address and assign a uselessly low limit like $1200.   Maybe after the 60 days when the $0 balance transfer fee expires, they raise the limit to something usable.   I can’t imagine that this card helps anybody’s credit rating.

        Sporttster,
- |
  This particular Chase Slate card definitely offers a $0 balance transfer fee for the first 60 days you have the card. After that time period there is a balance transfer fee, but within the first 60 days it is completely free to transfer your balances onto Chase Slate. It sounds like you might have transferred your balance after the 60 day period was up, thus incurring a fee.

        This is totally wrong. I transferred a balance to Slate and it cost me 2% balance trans fee and it was only a year long. You cannot find a card anymore that doesn’t charge that fee and 2% is as low as it gets. I did do a transfer before using a Discover card for 15 months but that was for 3%. And I’ve got excellent credit, 770.

        I have no problem using somebody else’s money for 12 or 15 months at no (or very low) cost. You just have to understand the conditions. I have several “inactive active” cards in my desk. They send low transfer offers all the time. I might transfer a balance here and there after a large purchase to take advantage of the 0%. You just have to realize that these cards are destined never to be swiped through a card reader. If you transfer a balance, you CAN NOT put other purchases on it. Screws everything up. Set up a payment plan for 1 month short of the promotional rate, set up automatic payments for at least the minimum (to cover the “oops, the due date slipped by and now I’m at 25%) and carry on. It’s not hard and you’re not going to burn in h-e double hockey sticks for doing it.

        Hahaha. Don’t get a credit card! Transferring your card balance every 15 months is idiotic. Paying off your balance EVERY month is the only smart thing you can do with a credit card. Don’t pay what you don’t have. If you use a credit card as an extension of your checking account (i.e. paying it off regularly), then you should be fine, but most people don’t, and credit card companies are literally banking on you not paying the full balance each month. Just avoid plastic if you want to master your money.

        I have had a chase card for many years and would do anything to get rid of it.  They have raise the rate on the card and it never goes down nor is they a way to request that they reevaluate the rate.  After being in the hospital for back surgery several years ago I made a single payment $50 less than the minimum.  They said I was in default and raised the rate to the max.  My credit score is in the mid 700’s but Chase will still not lower the rate.  I made the mistake of transferring my debt to their card to get their special low interest now I am stuck.  No one will give me an unsecure credit line high enough to transfer off the debt from the Slate card.

        Chase bank foreclosed on my cousin’s house when he was in the military reserve and got deployed to the middle east to fight for our country.  Its sneaky, greedy, malicious stunts  such as this and worse that make up the business methods Chase Bank and a few other banks are infamous for.

        I’ve had a number of credit cards and the two credit cards from Chase are the ones I have had no issues with.  For the people who complained about Chase changing terms, they need to understand what the offer is.  Chase is right up front indicating no fees for balance transfers the first 60 days.  That is exactly what is offered…transfer in the first 60 days and there is no fee.  No tricks.  Unfortunately, some people forget and let the 60 days slip up on them.  That may even be part of the reason a credit card company will offer a deal such as this one, because they can look at statistics and see just what percentage of account holders will forget about the 60 day offer and let it pass.  That, however, doesn’t make the company evil.  We just all need to read the fine print on offers and take advantage of the ones that can help us achieve what we all are trying to do….make our money reach further!

        I have a Chase Slate Card and transfer ballance every year as you suggest. When I first got the card, I paid no transfer fee, but the last two years, they charged me a  3% fee, even though it was done in January.

        Get your new card first with no transfer and then see what transfer deals it has a month later plus you will know the limit it give you at that time too. and THEN take advantage only if zero percent for a year or more. You will save interest for that period and maybe can pay it down or other cards with interest down during that time. Always know what the rate will be when it does take affect.

        This is BS.  I literally just applied and was only approved for $1000. Then when I went to transfer the allowed $950, the balance transfer offer was 17.99% APR with no fee.  Not the 0% for 15 months.  I have maintained great credit for the last 15 years and actually have 2 other accounts with Chase in excellent standing and this was the best this card could do? Waste of time and a ding on my credit for the application!

        David Johns,

  I can assure you that this card features $0 in balance transfer fees, as long as you transfer your money within the first 60 days of card ownership. It’s one of the biggest perks of having this card, as most other cards do charge a balance transfer fee. However, if you transfer your balance after the first 60 days it’s true you will probably pay a balance transfer fee. It sounds like this might have been the situation in your case, which is unfortunate.

        David Johns,

  I can assure you that this card features $0 in balance transfer fees, as long as you transfer your money within the first 60 days of card ownership. It’s one of the biggest perks of having this card, as most other cards do charge a balance transfer fee. However, if you transfer your balance after the first 60 days it’s true you will probably pay a balance transfer fee. It sounds like this might have been the situation in your case, which is unfortunate.

        Crap. After 4 invitations to apply, I applied wanted to transfer $3,000. They approved credit line $2,350 and transferred $2,300, making it an almost maxed out credit card. Which dropped my credit score with 40 points in 2 months. So DISGUSTING !!!
- |
  I had one before and they stole me of $16 ! When I was already to close it, they copy-paste and older charge, already paid 2 weekS ago. with the same date. Identical !

        I have a credit score around 650  I applied for tbe Slate card and was approved for a $6000 limit.  I used almost all of that limit to transfer balances away from higher rate cards that would not negotiate with me on my interest rate when I couldn’t afford to pay them  (Target Visa and Capital One).  The Chase card has a high rate after the no-interest period so you have to take advantage of the lack of interest and try to aggressively pay it off/down during the 15 months.

  With respect to those who think a person should always pay cash, etc., etc., keep in mind that sometimes life happens and forces you to charge stuff.  The important thing to remember is that the benefit of charging stuff will be long gone by the time you are done paying for it.  And durin that time you become enslaved to these credit card companies–and  they are not your friend.  No matter how cute the commercials are, credit card companies don’t care about you and will give you enough rope to hang yourself.  Trust me on this.  Keep them out of your wallet.  I’m not there yet but each montb I get a little closer.

        Dear “not THAT  Ron Johnson”,
- |
  If you read the entirety of the disclaimer at the bottom, right at the point where the words  all started looking like “blah-blah-blah” to you, you would see that the author of this site “may be compensated through the credit card issuer Affiliate Program” and let’s not kid ourselves… Tasha Lockyer most certainly was compensated for kissing Chase/Slate’s rear-end.
- |
  And! If you were to actually scroll all the way to the bottom of the page, you would’ve seen the icing on the cake that this fine human takes money to promote credit cards for a living, and I don’t doubt what a mighty fine living it is.

        Discover is the best credit card.  Their customer service is without equal.  They have resolved several issues for me quickly and efficiently.  Their cash-back program is excellent.  And their recent “nicety” of sending your credit rating score monthly is quite useful and interesting.

        Right after the holidays most people have racked up a balance on their credit cards and are wondering how they are going to pay it off. Chase Slate is a strong solution, offering a 15-month 0% APR on both balance transfers and purchases. Many cards offer a 0% intro APR, but the best part about Slate is that you won’t pay any balance transfer fees to move your balance(s) onto this card. That’s a huge win, since these fees are typically 3% of the balance you’re transferring, which can add up to big money. For example, if you’re transferring $5,000 you’d probably pay $150 in fees with other cards. With Slate you pay absolutely nothing to transfer your money, and you have 15 interest-free months to make payments against the balance, which means you can pay it down completely or at least get a head start on reducing it. Just make sure you transfer your balance in the first 60 days to take advantage of the $0 balance transfer fee, as after that time there will be a fee.
- |
  In addition to the 0% intro APR on balance transfers, you’ll also pay no interest for 15 months on purchases. This is a great way to make any big (or small) purchases you need and save money on interest fees for over a year. Plus, Slate has no annual fee and a fairly low ongoing APR after the 0% intro APR period which is important if you plan to carry a balance after the 15 months are up.
- |
  Another huge point in Slate’s favor is that it’s available to those with good credit. A good credit score is typically considered to be above 660. Usually credit cards with the best offers are only available to people with excellent credit histories, but Slate has all the great features offered to excellent credit consumers and is open to those with merely good credit. So if you’ve missed a payment or two, or had some other minor hits on your credit report you will likely still qualify for this card. Of course, Slate also considers other factors like your annual salary and wages, your other annual income and a review of your debt, but in general those with good credit have a good shot.
- |
  World travelers will appreciate that Slate now offers Chip and PIN technology. Chip-enabled cards are usually required when traveling outside the U.S., and if your card doesn’t have one you might not be able to use it when traveling internationally.
- |
  Things To Consider
- "Chase Slate is a smart way to gradually pay down your balance over the course of
  the 15-month 0% intro APR period, and after the no-interest period is up it continues
  to offer reasonable ongoing APRs. However, if you think you might be carrying your
  balance for a prolonged time, Barclay Ring Mastercard might be a better solution
  for you. It doesn’t have a 0% intro APR period, but features no balance transfer
  fee, no annual fee and a one of the lowest ongoing APRs we’ve ever seen â\x80\x93
  8.00% . Plus it gives you 1% back on the amount you transfer.\n"
- |
  Slate’s chip-enabled card makes it easy to travel internationally, but there is a 3% foreign transaction fee for each purchase you make. This fee can add up, particularly if you’re taking a long vacation and charging most purchases onto your card. If this is a deal-breaker for you, BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is an alternative to Slate that features no foreign transaction fees, no annual fee, 1.5 reward points for every dollar spent and a 12-month 0% intro APR.
- "Although Slate is a great balance transfer card, it doesn’t offer any rewards.
  If you’re interested in a balance transfer card that also has strong cash back rewards,
  take a look at the Discover it â\x80\x93 Balance Transfer card which has a 18-month
  0% intro APR, 5% cash back in categories that rotate quarterly, 1% cash back on
  everything else and no annual fee  (note: the card does have a 3% balance transfer
  fee).\n"

You can also take advantage of our free Balance Transfer Calculator to see which card is the best choice for your particular situation.

So if you’ve missed a payment or two, or had some other minor hits on your credit report you will likely still qualify for this card. Of course, Slate also considers other factors like your annual salary and wages, your other annual income and a review of your debt, but in general those with good credit have a good shot.

  World travelers will appreciate that Slate now offers Chip and PIN technology. Chip-enabled cards are usually required when traveling outside the U.S., and if your card doesn’t have one you might not be able to use it when traveling internationally.

  Things To Consider
- "Chase Slate is a smart way to gradually pay down your balance over the course of
  the 15-month 0% intro APR period, and after the no-interest period is up it continues
  to offer reasonable ongoing APRs. However, if you think you might be carrying your
  balance for a prolonged time, Barclay Ring Mastercard might be a better solution
  for you. It doesn’t have a 0% intro APR period, but features no balance transfer
  fee, no annual fee and a one of the lowest ongoing APRs we’ve ever seen â\x80\x93
  8.00% . Plus it gives you 1% back on the amount you transfer.\n"

  Slate’s chip-enabled card makes it easy to travel internationally, but there is a 3% foreign transaction fee for each purchase you make. This fee can add up, particularly if you’re taking a long vacation and charging most purchases onto your card. If this is a deal-breaker for you, BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is an alternative to Slate that features no foreign transaction fees, no annual fee, 1.5 reward points for every dollar spent and a 12-month 0% intro APR.
- "Although Slate is a great balance transfer card, it doesn’t offer any rewards.
  If you’re interested in a balance transfer card that also has strong cash back rewards,
  take a look at the Discover it â\x80\x93 Balance Transfer card which has a 18-month
  0% intro APR, 5% cash back in categories that rotate quarterly, 1% cash back on
  everything else and no annual fee  (note: the card does have a 3% balance transfer

  Right after the holidays most people have racked up a balance on their credit cards and are wondering how they are going to pay it off. Chase Slate is a strong solution, offering a 15-month 0% APR on both balance transfers and purchases. Many cards offer a 0% intro APR, but the best part about Slate is that you won’t pay any balance transfer fees to move your balance(s) onto this card. That’s a huge win, since these fees are typically 3% of the balance you’re transferring, which can add up to big money. For example, if you’re transferring $5,000 you’d probably pay $150 in fees with other cards. With Slate you pay absolutely nothing to transfer your money, and you have 15 interest-free months to make payments against the balance, which means you can pay it down completely or at least get a head start on reducing it. Just make sure you transfer your balance in the first 60 days to take advantage of the $0 balance transfer fee, as after that time there will be a fee.
- |
  In addition to the 0% intro APR on balance transfers, you’ll also pay no interest for 15 months on purchases. This is a great way to make any big (or small) purchases you need and save money on interest fees for over a year. Plus, Slate has no annual fee and a fairly low ongoing APR after the 0% intro APR period which is important if you plan to carry a balance after the 15 months are up.

With Slate you pay absolutely nothing to transfer your money, and you have 15 interest-free months to make payments against the balance, which means you can pay it down completely or at least get a head start on reducing it. Just make sure you transfer your balance in the first 60 days to take advantage of the $0 balance transfer fee, as after that time there will be a fee.
- |
  In addition to the 0% intro APR on balance transfers, you’ll also pay no interest for 15 months on purchases. This is a great way to make any big (or small) purchases you need and save money on interest fees for over a year. Plus, Slate has no annual fee and a fairly low ongoing APR after the 0% intro APR period which is important if you plan to carry a balance after the 15 months are up.
- |
  Another huge point in Slate’s favor is that it’s available to those with good credit. A good credit score is typically considered to be above 660. Usually credit cards with the best offers are only available to people with excellent credit histories, but Slate has all the great features offered to excellent credit consumers and is open to those with merely good credit. So if you’ve missed a payment or two, or had some other minor hits on your credit report you will likely still qualify for this card. Of course, Slate also considers other factors like your annual salary and wages, your other annual income and a review of your debt, but in general those with good credit have a good shot.
- |
  World travelers will appreciate that Slate now offers Chip and PIN technology. Chip-enabled cards are usually required when traveling outside the U.S., and if your card doesn’t have one you might not be able to use it when traveling internationally.

  Things To Consider
- "Chase Slate is a smart way to gradually pay down your balance over the course of
  the 15-month 0% intro APR period, and after the no-interest period is up it continues
  to offer reasonable ongoing APRs. However, if you think you might be carrying your
  balance for a prolonged time, Barclay Ring Mastercard might be a better solution
  for you. It doesn’t have a 0% intro APR period, but features no balance transfer
  fee, no annual fee and a one of the lowest ongoing APRs we’ve ever seen â\x80\x93
  8.00% . Plus it gives you 1% back on the amount you transfer.\n"
- |
  Slate’s chip-enabled card makes it easy to travel internationally, but there is a 3% foreign transaction fee for each purchase you make. This fee can add up, particularly if you’re taking a long vacation and charging most purchases onto your card. If this is a deal-breaker for you, BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is an alternative to Slate that features no foreign transaction fees, no annual fee, 1.5 reward points for every dollar spent and a 12-month 0% intro APR.
- "Although Slate is a great balance transfer card, it doesn’t offer any rewards.
  If you’re interested in a balance transfer card that also has strong cash back rewards,
  take a look at the Discover it â\x80\x93 Balance Transfer card which has a 18-month
  0% intro APR, 5% cash back in categories that rotate quarterly, 1% cash back on
  everything else and no annual fee  (note: the card does have a 3% balance transfer
  fee).\n"

  Right after the holidays most people have racked up a balance on their credit cards and are wondering how they are going to pay it off. Chase Slate is a strong solution, offering a 15-month 0% APR on both balance transfers and purchases. Many cards offer a 0% intro APR, but the best part about Slate is that you won’t pay any balance transfer fees to move your balance(s) onto this card. That’s a huge win, since these fees are typically 3% of the balance you’re transferring, which can add up to big money.

        Barclay Ringmaster is a good card. 8% interest. For the person that had their SS # stolen. You can do a fraud alert on the credit bureaus for yourself & no on can open an account in your name for 6 months. You can do it longer. You will have to ask how though? I’ve done it twice, as  I had some problems with internet security. Peace of mind to me that for 6 months no worries about anymore trying to open an account in my name. There is a 1-800 number, so google “putting a 6 month fraud alert on your credit bureau account, & credit cards, and it will give you the number. If I can’t pay the balance, then I don’t use the card, & pay in cash only. There are different Barclay credit cards, but Ringmaster was 8% for me. I am very bad at opening cards just to get cash awards back. I have too many cards because of it. I want to close some of them, as I don’t use them, but I heard it will lower my credit score if I do?

        To never use credit cards is NOT the answer.  It is possible that some people should never use a credit card, but I use mine almost every day.  I have not paid interest in over 20 years, and my cards pay me hundreds of dollars, per year, in cash back.  How?  Just pay the card off, every month.

        I have excellent credit and I’m looking to pay down some debt incurred during a divorce. After reading about this card and the comments about the low credit limit, I believe there are better ones out there.

        I have had the Chase Slate card since 2011. I received the same great benefits when I applied for the card. I have excellent credit and only started with a $2500 credit limit as well but when you prove yourself to them and ask for an increase they are happy to give it to you. I receive 0% checks in the mail every month from them which I have taken advantage of for grad school. These checks do have a 2 or 3% fee now but they are very helpful to get 0% for an additional year. I have had no problems with Chase Slate.

        This card is a big waste of time and was of no help to our family at all.  I applied and only got a lousy $2,500 credit limit.  What good is that?  I called and asked for a higher limit and was declined.  I have excellent credit with not one negative mark going back 20 years.  Today I cancelled it and the customer service rep asked why.  I explained that the low credit limit was of no use and that I had been declined for a higher limit.  She showed no concern and was only too happy to proceed in canceling my unused account.  Don’t waste your time with Chase and this card.  I will make sure I NEVER do business with any company that has CHASE in the name.  What a rip off and a complete waste of time.

        Finally getting away from using the Chase card. When they purchased the original company who owned my card. My rate jumped from 20% to 26.24% and decreased my credit line. How disappointing and I was paying on time as well. Gonna think twice when I use this card. At no time have I been able to get them to lower the rate even though for close to 8 years I have paid on time. The interest that accumulates on the card is outrageous though I enjoy the Blueprint program which the other company didn’t have.

  Its was too hard to get a card after going through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and getting a credit card 2 years later. Now for those who are trying to get a card they are really tough I heard…. but looking for a new card w/zero interest….I’m going with Capital One who was generous to give me twice the credit line than Chase and 24% w/ zero interest for 12 months with 3% transfer fee. Of course I will keep my Chase card using it once a month just to keep it active because I have a long credit history of 8 years.

  I’ve sold a great deal of credit cards while working for TD Bank and they seem easy to get a card even though I was not approved. But usually you had to have excellent credit.

  16, 2015There are a lot of balance transfer credit cards out there, designed specifically
  for anyone who is carrying a balance on their credit card and paying high (or any)
  interest fees each month. In fact, there are so many it can be challenging to determine
  how one is better or worse than the others. Chase Slate is one of the cards vying
  for your business, and we took an in-depth look at this card to answer the question
  “is it any good?” The short answer is yes, it’s a great choice that can save you
  hundreds or thousands of dollars if you’re currently paying interest on another
  credit card.Â  It’s the only card we’ve found with the combination of a lengthy
  0% intro APR and no balance transfer fee. The in-depth answer, as well as the card’s
  pros and cons, is explained below.Right after the holidays most people have racked
  up a balance on their credit cards and are wondering how they are going to pay it
  off. Chase Slate is a strong solution, offering a 15-month 0% intro APR on both
  balance transfers and purchases. Many cards offer a 0% intro APR, but the best part
  about Slate is that you won’t pay any balance transfer fees to move your balance(s)
  onto this card. That’s a huge win, since these fees are typically 3% of the balance
  you’re transferring, which can add up to big money. For example, if you’re transferringÂ $10,000
  you’d probably pay $300 in fees with other cards. With SlateÂ you pay absolutely
  nothing to transfer your money, and you have 15Â interest-free months to make payments
  against the balance, which canÂ give you even bigger savings. For example, if you
  were making $700Â monthly payments on that $10,000 balance and had a 20% interest
  rate,Â it would take you 17 months to pay it off and you’d pay over $1,500 inÂ interest.
  If you transferred that balance to Slate, you’d pay it offÂ in 15 months with no
  interest, saving $1,500 and paying absolutely noÂ fees.Â Just make sure you transfer
  your balance in the first 60 days to take advantage of the $0 balance transfer fee,
  as after that time there will be a fee.In addition to the 0% intro APR on balance
  transfers, you’ll also pay no interest for 15 months on purchases. This is a great
  way to make any big (or small) purchases you need and save money on interest fees
  for over a year. Plus, Slate has no annual fee and a fairly low ongoing APR after
  the 0% intro APR period which is important if you plan to carry a balance after
  the 15 months are up.If you’ve been known to make a late payment or two you’ll appreciate
  that Slate has no penalty APR. This means your interest rate won’t increase if your
  payment is delayed. We don’t recommend habitually paying your bill late, but it’s
  nice to know if it does happens you won’t be penalized for it.Another huge point
  in Slate’s favor is that it’s available to those with good credit. A good credit
  score is typically considered to be above 660.Â Usually credit cards with the best
  offers are only available to people with excellent credit histories, but Slate has
  all the great features offered to excellent credit consumers and is open to those
  with merely good credit. So if you’ve missed a payment or two, or had some other
  minor hits on your credit report you will likely still qualify for this card. Of
  course, Slate also considers other factors like your annual salary and wages, your
  other annual income and a review of your debt, but in general those with good credit
  have a good shot.World travelers will appreciate that Slate nowÂ offers Chip and
  PIN technology. Chip-enabled cards are usually required when traveling outside the
  U.S., and if your card doesn’t have one you might not be able to use it when traveling
  internationally.Chase Slate is a smart way to gradually pay down your balance over
  the course of the 15-month 0% intro APR period, and after the no-interest period
  is up it continues to offer reasonable ongoing APRs. However, if you think you might
  be carrying your balance for a prolonged time, Barclaycard Ring Mastercard might
  be a better solution for you. It doesn’t have a 0% intro APR period, but features
  no balance transfer fee, no annual fee and a one of the lowest ongoing APRs we’ve
  ever seen – 8.00% .If a 15-month 0% intro APR isn’t quite enough, but you think
  you can pay down your balance in under 2 years, consider Citi Simplicity. ItÂ has
  an incredibly lengthy 21-month intro APR on balance transfers and purchases, which
  would give you an extra 6 months of 0% APR breathing room. There is a 3% balance
  transfer fee, but those 6 extra months might make it worthwhile.Slate’s chip-enabled
  card makes it easy to travel internationally, but there is a 3% foreign transaction
  fee for each purchase you make. This fee can add up, particularly if you’re taking
  a long vacation and charging most purchases onto your card. If this is a deal-breaker
  for you, BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit CardÂ is an alternative to Slate that
  features no foreign transaction fees, a 20,000 point intro bonus (worth $200 when
  you redeem towards travel), no annual fee, 1.5 reward points for every dollar spent
  and a 12-month 0% intro APR.Although Slate is a great balance transfer card, it
  doesn’t offer any rewards. If you’re interested in a balance transfer card that
  also has strong cash back rewards, take a look at the Discover it – Balance Transfer
  card which has a 18-month 0% intro APR on balance transfers, 5% cash back in categories
  that rotate quarterly (now through Dec 31st they are Amazon.com, department stores
  and clothing stores), 1% cash back on everything else and no annual fee (note: the
  card does have a 3% balance transfer fee). And as a very generous added bonus, you’ll
  get double cash back your first year! That means if you earn $300 in year one, Discover
  will give you another $300 for a total earnings of $600, which is pretty spectacular.
  Or if your credit history has a ding or two on it, consider Chase Freedom. Chase
  Freedom is available to those with just good credit (typically considered to be
  a credit score above 660), and itÂ features a 15-month 0% intro APR and up to 5%
  cash back in quarterly categories. Just in time for the holiday season those 5%
  categories are Amazon.com, Zappos.com, Audible.com and Diapers.com until December
  31st. And Chase Freedom just raised its intro bonus to a whopping $150 after you
  spend just $500 in the first three months, effectively over 30% cash back on your
  first $500 spent.Chase Slate is a very strong card and is unique in that it lets
  you transfer your existing balances free of charge and pay no interest for 15 months
  on balance transfers and purchases. We highly recommend Chase Slate, and it is our
  best-ranked balance transfer card. It’s particularly appealing because it’s available
  to those with good (rather than just excellent) credit and features the chip-and-PIN
  technology that’s so important when traveling overseas.There are some potential
  drawbacks though, including no rewards and a foreign transaction fee. If these are
  concerns for you, check out the above-mentioned alternatives. You can also take
  advantage of our free Balance Transfer Calculator to see which card is the best
  choice for your particular situation.Disclaimer: This content is not provided or

  tuition payments on zero interest for 15 month credit cards … then transferred all
  to chase slate for fifteen months zero interest and no transfer fees… zero interest
  ends May 16 on slate.\n"

  Got about two years interest free keeping up with monthly payments of about 1%  of balance. Saved a  few dollars and now she is working.A good discussion of the positive features of the Chase card, but not the negative. I really should not call them negative, just features that make it less useful.

  I have a “good” credit score, but have several credit cards and carry a total balance of $50,000. (Don’t comment with your neither a borrow nor a lender be messages, this balance came about because of businesses I owned failing.)
- |
  I pay a very high rate of interest on that $50,000 – averaging around 25% a year.  A credit card with zero transfer fees and a low APR would be wonderful. However (and I have looked into this) if I apply one of these “great” credit cards I will be lucky to get a limit of $3000. While that would help, it is not a game changer. So I am stuck in a situation in which my low interest loan (house mortgage) is getting nicely paid off, it is hard to make a dent on the high interest ones.The best way to say out of debt is not to own a Credit Cord any credit cord… if I don’t have the cash I don’t need it…What balances?  I pay off  my cards each month and do not carry any balances from month.  If I don’t have the money, I don’t need it!  Viola! no debt to carry over that keeps getting higher and higher each month!I got 18 months no interest with Chase on $5000.00  ~Thanks Chase~for emergence use eI attemped to renew my subscription.   Money was witdrawn from my account but I still do not have subscription privaledges.  nittypoptart990I have a question, if your current card offers miles and you TRANSFER the unpaid balance to another card do you get the miles on the balance the new card then Paid OFF if you are NOT canceling that card?How do I  apply for a  C hace  SkateNeed more information on this.  This sounds great.Unless you are in 20% or greater, just keep the card you have. Don’t use it ever again.  Pay 2X the minimum or more each month.  Pay it down until you can pay it off totally.  Don’t bother getting a zero interest transfer, you will just be tempted to use the old card.  Also pay yourself first.  Open a savings account and put some money aside every payday, even if $10 or $20.  Do it every paycheck and don’t touch.  Watch it grow.WARNING – This may sound great at first, but your Credit Rating may suffer. First, you take a hit for the Inquiry against your Credit. Then your score will drop for opening a new account when one card has a high balance. I know. It happened to me. No more Balance Transfers for me.the best and only way to pay off a credit card is send them a check and cut up the dam cardHow do I apply for Chase Slate?Credit Cards are voluntary slavery so I guess if you like being a slave then get one…otherwise be smart and save your money and don’t spend what you don’t have…that’s the best financial advice youll ever get and TRUTHFUL…I got guns for sale 9mmI got guns for sale hit me upCan I transfer a high interest amount from another card to my Chase card even though I have another Chase card?Yes this slate transfer balance is only for new or non chase customers. i have been with chase many many years fairly good fico # and good credit score and they gave me the same line credit ratio blah blah blah, well no duh that is why iwant a transfer balance.Irene Nixon,

   you admit that you were late in paying TWICE, yet you blame the bank (‘…WTG Chase !!!!…’), for charging you late fees which they told you in the application they would.!!!  You didn’t read the application you signed, and you blame the bank for your lack of responsibility and being a dumbass!!!!  I bet you vote Democrat.Is best to simply not have credit cards.  No one needs them.  I get around fine with my debit card and now  I actually have a real safety not fund that has a year’s salary in it, if I ever have a true emergency.  People live in debt and it has become acceptable, but if you have on major life event, there goes your house, there goes your car, there goes your life.  My suggestion, stop using credit cards, start paying off the small ones little by little.  Then start putting more money to pay off your home faster and pay off your car.  It’s amazing how big your take home pay becomes when you don’t have monthly debt payments on credit cards, a car, or even a house.Oh yes.  If you have plenty of money, and don’t really have much debt, Chase Slate is for you.  They will be happy to let you transfer balance owed on another card.  However, my fiance, who has a credit score of 712, and ALWAYS pays his bills on time,  applied.  He wanted to transfer the balance from his Discover card (which I think was $15,000).  They refused him because they said he had too much debt (car payment, etc.)  What’s the point if all they want is people who hardly owe anything.  Slate sounded so good until we realized that they really don’t want to help those who really could use a few months of no interest while they continue to pay off a credit card balance!!!!!B.S I have a Chase Slate card with chip . They do not let you pay anything before your monthly statement arrives and there late fee is $35.00. I was late a couple of times by about 3 days [only because I got the due date of 2 credit cards confused:-( WTG Chase !!!!I need to know more?what a wonderful worldthis would be a nice they for meno commentI should have read these comments first. I am an existing customer. It sounded like it would help with some other higher rate balances.  I called Chase. No such offer for existing customers as stated in one or more of the helpful comments. I hope you all get and stay out of debt. There are better dances to be danced.bullshit remve from sucker listDon’t fool yourself with balance transfers. If you can’t pay off your card balance when you get the statement don’t spend the money. You will have more money in the long run in your pocket instead of owing the money. Get cards that pay cash back or rewards with no yearly fees. Of course you have to build your credit score up to get these cards. I learned my lesson 15 years ago and have been raking in the cash rewards ever since.looking for a business line of creditThey would not lend me a dime and I have my mortgage there.   When I begged for a loan to put on a new roof at the house, all I got was $500.   My roof was $4,700.  Bad deal on this card unless you only want $500.  That is all they ever lend you.  Bank of America is worse.Seb….That credit score is a ruff one but there are websites out there for credit cards for all types of credit and just try to find a zero interest card that you qualify for and don’t use it for any purchases. Even if it has a high interest and maybe only 12 month transfer. At least for  12 months you will be paying principle, just don’t miss any payments and your credit will improve. In time your score will improve and you can qualify for better cards with better benefits. If you buy a car and make payments on time yous credit score will sky rocket.You’re in debt because of Democrats? How funny. I’m in less Debt now then i was under Bush. Anyways A zero balance transfer card like the chase card being pitched on this article is a great way to pay down debt. Even if you can not get the balance fully paid off in the term agreement what i have done is roll over the remaining balance to another zero balance credit card. I currently use a American Express for my zero interest for 18 months. I will have the balance paid off with 200 dollar payments each month by the time the term expires. The zero transfer fee is VERY huge on this card and when I decide to get another one of these types of cards i will apply.You are in debt because of the Democrats (last 4 letters spell RATS) Remember that the next time you vote.just checked, they still have it. 24 months 0 apr (although they do charge a balance transfer fee)if you are near a Santander Bank your best bet is to go with theirs. i opened one with balance transfer for 24 months(don’t know if they still have this offer) and if you set up your automatic deposit and pay 2 bills from the account every month they deposit 20 dollars into your savings account. can’t beat thatThere are so many mixed reviews here… some say fraud some say wonderful! How do I really find out the truth? My cards total only $1,100 so this looks like a great idea. But, is it?TexRancher is right.  Those social conservative republicans in congress want to destroy this country by giving it to the wealthy elite like the Kochs, Adelson and anyone else with billion$.  They only care about the rest of us a few months before election time.  VOTE Democratic or Independent.Same happen to me, just because I had a late payment ONE !!! they made it sound like it was the deadliest sin in the world.  They screw my credit score of 700+ with their investigation and at the end they offer me much, much less than what I needed it.  I told them thank you but no thank you I don’t need another credit card .  RIP OFFWhat if my credit score is 610-630? What is a good solution for avoiding interest? I cannot get approved for Chase Slate.I was left  by my boyfreind of 25 years, when he left, so did my income, not married.

  I need help with my  bills. My credit score went to the basement. I need to have help,
- |
  I see no way out but death. no job, no income other what  SSI , not even enough to live on to get me through the month.

  Can or won’t someone please help me, please??Ya, I was denied as well.  Now, my credit score is lower because of their inquiry.it is great to transfer your balance to a new card with zero interest ONLY if you promise yourself not to use the new card for any new purchases at all. Why?  Because the old debt you transfer to your new card will be used first to pay off while the new purchases you made will be last to pay off . What it means is that you will be stuck with your new balance accumulating interest charges without ability to pay it down at all until you pay off your old debt first.. it is a ZERO SUCKER TRAP! I was lucky to catch the dirty trick before accumulating too much new debt so I paid it off earlier than I liked to.. Never again!  But you can still transfer your old balance to your new zero interest card but REMEMBER NEVER TO USE THE CARD TO MAKE ANY NEW PURCHASES AT ALL!!  Use the new card to pay off your old debt at zero interest.. Don’t dally or goof around with it as zero interest will expire in 18 months or whatever it says ..   Use the time to pay off that  old debt … never use it to make new purchases !~! Pass this along to your friends  !I got two of these cards and transferred balances and no trouble whatsoever.  0% interest for 15 months and on was for 18 months I think.  No problems and I transferred 2500 on each card.  It will be paid off within the time period and I saved a lot of interest.  I suggest trying it.Stupid, uneducated people fail Or refuse , to recognize what muslims represent in this world…..That includes those socialists in Congress!TexRancher, DOD school in Ankara, Turkey 1957-1959!Don’t believe a word of this offer — it is a SCAM!True.   Be prepared to have a it on your credit  score and then they turn you down because your credit balances are too high.Very interested in thisThis was a total waste of time!!!!  I was approved for a miniscule amount which did NOTHNG for me.  So, then the account had to be closed which does not look good on a credit report.  Wish I had never done it – if you want more than $1000.00 don’t waste your time…..just wish they would have told me this up front and saved us both time.If you haven’t got one of these cards, you’ll have to be approved for a credit limit. If accepted, you can’t transfer an amount that’s more than 80% of that limit. When you request a balance transfer at the same time that you apply, you just have to sit back and wait for the verdict. If you’re asking to transfer $10,000 but they only approve you for a $10,000 limit, they’ll only transfer $8,000, leaving you to juggle the remainder. They base your limit on more than your credit score — household income is a big factor. And as noted, you can’t transfer balances from one card to another card with the same company. You might have to play a shell game, transferring a balance to a card with a different company then back, but if you try that, you might suddenly find that you’re ineligible for any balance transfer.Sounds easy and reasonable.It all sounds good, but if you don’t have a high credit score, you’re out of luck here.What will the interest be after 15 months?Sorry Janny Brown, I never said not to spend money, but these credit companies are designed to MAKE MONEY from YOUR MONEY. And yes you do need credit to a degree,  Just be careful of their traps as that are designed to put you more into debt, How many companies do you know that get people out of debt?  Yes, life has some unexpected surprises, that’s why you must plan for them.  My debt was a medical emergency, but I paid that down like it was on fire, They would have eaten me alive on the interest collected.  Use them, don’t let them use you.  I hope your situation improves soon.  Been there, done that and learned.We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.
- "Albert EinsteinDave Ramsey – I bet chase hates him.Offer   balance   transfer   at
  \ 0%   APR   ,  as   announced   by   some   Credit   Card   Companies   is   just
  \  a   trap.  It’s    not   going   to   work   if   you   are   an   impulsive
  \  spender.  Always   remember    not   to   spend   money   you   don’t    have
  \   and   you   will   never   have   to   spend    sleepless    Nights.Some people
  easy to say Donâ\x80\x99t spend money, No credit card, no debt. While other people
  may be in different situation, such as kids in college, parents ill, own business
  less than 5 years, etc. That is how my credit card debt come from. I pay thousands
  dollars each month for high interests charges.  I have to search balance transfer
  offers all the time to save money. I tried Chase, but I canceled the same day I
  received the card. It was surprise to me they gave me such little availability,
  regardless how much I can make. I donâ\x80\x99t need to transfer my pocket exchanges
  to this credit card.Don’t even THINK of applying for Slate from Chase. My FICO is
  a respectable 750+ and I was approved for a puny amount. I don’t want another Credit
  Card, I want to transfer balances. It’s a bait and switch operation!No credit card,
  no debt.  I own everything I have.  It forces me to save for a rainy day, and I
  sleep better than those with three credit cards.  But if you need a credit card,
  stay away from Synchony.  I made more than the regular payment and paid them off,
  during that time they lowered my credit limit (no problem), and when I paid them
  off, they closed my account (Can’t use them for reference, but they can’t erase
  my payment history).  They were not happy because they were not able to collect
  their 27% + interest.  These cards are known as “Poverty Traps”.   Instead of helping,
  it adds more burden and more debt.  Make a plan (Budget) and stick to it.  Don’t
  buy things you don’t need, you can still enjoy life. Things don’t make you happy,
  it may make things easier……but not happy.  Get your priorities straight  and you
  will be happy.People should be told a couple of things about Chase Slate – they
  do not accept complete balance transfers.  There is a limit.  So, if you are looking
  to transfer a large amount and try to get it down quickly – you will be disappointed.
  \ Then, all you will get out of it is an additional credit card – which is not good.
  \ f you have another Chase Card that has a high interest – like we do – you can’t
  transfer or request to receive this card to get that amount down either.  Basically,
  this is not to help you get out of debt, but to trap you into owing them.How do
  I apply to Chase Slate?I have two credit cards, my credit score, (myfico.com) is
  793. If I get another card, my score will drop 55 points, according to Fico.(KITING)
  TO THE NTH DEGREEI don’t have any credit cards at all, or any finance payments.
  \ Life is good when it’s simple and you make what you want instead of buying it.Another
  card to consider for balance transfer options is the LLBean Visa Card.  The rewards
  are great if you are a huge fan of their products.  However, for around the past
  year or so, they have been offering balance transfer options of 0% APR for 15 months
  and only a 1% balance transfer fee.  The fee goes to 3% if you choose the 0% APR
  for 18 months.  $50 for a %5000 balance transfer basically pays itself after the
  first month.Don’t spend money you don’t have in the first place. Then there is nothing
  to worry about, to check, to consider, yadda yadda yadda.If you want to take advantage
  of making a transfer for 0% interest whether there is a transfer fee or not from
  any Credit Card company.  Consider to pay off at an extended time 15 months for
  CHASE or 21 months for CITI Simplicity.  A very high interest will apply thereafter.
  \  In the meantime, you should consider pay off new purchases on the bill.  Pay
  maximum to the one with highest interest. Pay minimum to the lowest one.  Think
  twice your shopping cart “Only buy the one you need, do not buy the one you want”.
  \ Do this way you would get out of your debt soon.Have a high credit score of 780
  & was only approved for $800.00 ??????????\n"

  We declined the card that Chase offered. Not helpful at all!!!Have a large balance on my MasterCard I would like to alleviate…how do I apply for the card?Ask her who subsidized her !I would like to combine 3 credit cards to pay off . LarryheyChase Slate is great for parking high-interest debt. But balance transfers are slooooow, and the 60-day no-fee window closes fast. Thereafter it’s 3%, $5 minimum fee, so you would want to transfer a minimum of $167 to get the max efficiency from the fee. Chase Freedom has been doing 5% cash back on gas.  Speedway, formerly Hess, offers 10 cents a gallon off  when you use their Speedy Rewards card before you purchase.  Speedway is same price, cash or credit. In addition, Freedom offers another 3% cash back if you redeem your Freedom points for Lowe’s cards.  So that’s 10 cents a gallon off, plus 8% cash back  net at Lowes.Cap One Quicksilver is a much faster balance transfer card. They have an annual fee, I think $39 0r $49, but no transfer fee thru March 2016. I pay $200 to the Quik card, and then do 4 separate $50 balance transfers to my other cards.  Balance transfers count as a payment, so on my credit report, my $200 becomes $400 in on-time payments.BE SURE YOU CHECK THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ZERO-INTEREST OFFERS!
- |
  MANY REQUIRE THAT THE BALANCE IS PAID OFF AT THE END OF THE PROMOTIONAL PERIOD, OR THEY WILL CHARGE YOU FULL INTEREST FROM DAY ONE!!Just close the cards  at your request so your credit doesn’t get affected. Pay extra to the ones with higher interests, pay the minimum on the others. Do this for every card, you be free in about two years, depending on how high your debt is. Never, and I mean NEVER get into one of those programs that promise to help you. They will just screw you more, like freedom debt. They don’t work with your creditors, they just have you send them money and after they got a lot, then they intend to negotiate, mean while, your cards are not getting paid, and your credit score drops below 600. I know, I did it……..I have extra wood?Don Johnson, your credit score does NOT go down every time a creditor checks your credit report, only if it is done at YOUR request, such as when you apply for credit.  Many companies that have extended you credit will check your report EVERY month, but that does not affect your score at all.This is my third attempt to make a negative comment!!  DON’T DO CHASE!!  SCAM FOR $1000 LIMIT CARD.   NO BALANCE TRANSFERS!!!can a Wall Mart Card be transferred to another card?This card will only give you $1000 to start with if you have average salary so you will not be able to transfer large balances as they promise. Opening any new credit card will hurt your credit score.  So, only open this if you can get by with very small transfer or make a lot of money.I saw this article before (at least something similar to it).   I applied because not only are my cards maxed, but I have two that are over 29% and are going nowhere fast.  Plus I have 2 cards that charged a late fee 0 which made it an over limit fee and I have been playing THAT circle game for almost a year.  How did I get like this??  I am on SSI disability and on Medicare and last year had breast cancer surgery. after 2 lumpectomies, I ended up having a double mastectomy and phase one reconstruction.  Bills kept coming in and charged everything so that I could get the medical refund on the taxes.  I was going to used the 0% card to pay off and destroy my 2 29% cards and get back under my max on the “circle” cards.   I have a 680 credit rating and was turned down for the very reason I wanted to do this.   Is there anyway I can get this offer – a way to appeal?? BTW..  I am 3months cancer free.Wow, well hidden native advertising. Grrr.Transfer Balance??

  Why not just stop charging and pay it off unless of course you feel you’re winning a game that doesn’t need to be played.What is the interest rate after the 15 months with an 800 credit score?

I now coordinate one of these courses in the Baltimore area annually to keep my focus and to “pay it forward”.  DO THIS!Does not apply if you are trying to transfer an existing Chase balance (eg. Sapphire) to SlateI currently have a Chase credit card, plus three other credit cards.I have done the balance transfer dance with cards I already have that are offering a promotional balance transfer with 0%apr. My apprehension is in opening a new card just for this purpose, I read once (maybe suze orman) that every time you apply for a new credit card (even in stores on the spot) they check your credit score and that every time your score is checked it goes down tick. Does anybody know if this is true? Because if its not, I get these offers in the mail all the time, and will start using them.chase will not allow you to move outstanding balances from one chase card to another I tried in the past.Does anyone know whether Chase will allow you to do a balance transfer from another Chase credit card?I’ve been doing this for the last couple of years.  I try to use 1% transfer fee, but I have 12 – 15 months interest free.  It’s a no-brainer.  I’d rather pay $30 in fees than $300 in interes.If your record isn’t perfect they won’t issue you a card.  They hold things against you from over 10 years ago too.Exactly because they offered 15-months @ 0% and $0 fee for balance transfers, I applied for a Chase Slate card and was approved for $7500 (my credit score was 820 at the time). Just as promoted, I successfully transferred $7350 from another card, no fee was charged, and no interest has accrued. It’s now been 3 months and I’m 100% satisfied.Good concept….but i guess you have to have flawless credit…my score is over 700…but application was rejected….reason I had recently opened an account. …why advertise consolidation if you cant get a chance to do so??My FICO score is around 740.  How much would a Slate card allow me to transfer?  I see that one lady said that she was limited to $1700.00.more infoAs long as your a new card member its a great deal, but those who already have the card are left out in the cold.  Not impressive long term customer incentive to say the least so the card sits in a drawer for so long I can’t remember the last time I actually used it.You had best check their REAL rates based on your FICO score. They charged my son
- |
  27.96% from the day he opened his account.  This is the carrot dangling from the stick.
- |
  Some companies offer MUCH LOWER rates than the Chase Slate card.I would be interested in the Chase Slate. Please send me an email.
- |
  Thanks.Most cards will charge you the entire interest if not paid by the drop dead date (15 months in this case).

  I did a thing when I built my house. I had many credit cards (generally which I didn’t use much and always paid them off). I had many offers of transfer balance, so I parlayed those offers into financing my construction. I created a spreadsheet to remind me when I needed to pay them  off. I would often pay one off w/ another and then sometimes back again. Ultimately, I paid them all off with my equity I gained from a house I sold and ultimately the rest when I sold the house I was living in and everything. I played their game to the hilt … and did OK … BUT … you have to manage those balance transfers very carefully. 0% and no balance transfer is key.Best way to get rid of credit card debit is not to have a credit card at all. Get rid of all of them. Next step, Google Dave Ramsey! He’ll wake you up. Trust me, I was sleeping for a long time!I would like some more information about Chase Slate by mail.  7 North Cherokee Lane, Brick, NJ  08724.NotWhyI would like more  info.,pleaseI applied and was approved with my good credit.

It’s possible you transferred your balance after this 60 day period. However, the Chase Slate we discuss in this blog post and link to has absolutely no balance transfer fees (prior to the 60 day cut off).Hi @Cathy, The Chase Slate card we detail on this page has NO balance transfer fee if you transfer your balance in the first 60 days.

My husband passed away, I became disabled and now we/I  have enormace credit card debt.  Because of “LIFE” happening and having to pay bills I’m in debt.  I’ve never missed a payment, or had any other problems but now that I really need assistance no one is willing to give a person a chance.   I can’t believe that if you have always had excellent credit scores until “Life” happened it doesn’t make a difference.  Excellent past history doesn’t mean a thing, one one will  give me a chance to get my life back together again.    It’s sad that the USA will literally take a persons home if illness or death cause unforeseen expenses.   I probably shouldn’t say this but… Of course, if I came from another country I would get the medical for free.  Then I wouldn’t been in such a sad place.  To all the others in this situation, let’s pray for each other.  Nothing else seems to help.I agree with many of the people on here.

Transferring and consolidating debt is never a good idea.

I PAID 800 PER MONTH AND HAD IT PAID OFF IN THE ZERO INTEREST PERIOD.  I HAVE SINCE USED THE CHECKS THEY ISSUE EVERY MONTH AND SAME GREAT DEAL ON THEM.

They all promise this and when it comes time to transfer an existing balance, they decline indicating the amount is too high – stating…you are a new customer to them so you have no payment history with them.  So then, you’re left juggling two credit cards because they generally only allow a balance transfer of half the amount, if that.   I think it’s false advertisement and Chase Bank is horrible to do business with.  I’ve heard a lot of complaints from friends and family.I’ll never fall for this again.

They wait till you make one late payment to increase the interest rate to 29% or 31%. There was a time I had 31% for my card balance.What kind of business was that? Recenly I called them and requested a lower interest rate since my credit score is now very close to 700. My request was denied. I think my chase card interest rate right now is 26% now.  I transfered the balance to Citi card which I have 21 months 0% interest and thereafter 15%. No late fee and no panelty APR (29%-31% like chase gave me). Just one time 3% for balance transfer which was something very little compare to Chase charged me over many years. Thank you Citi card.

If the card you use for the transfers is an existing account and doesn’t have the 0% on purchases don’t use the card for purchases keep it separate . with the new credit card act passed in 2010 by President Obama a default Apr can only be applied to new purchases not the existing bal on the act , also with all credit cards due to new laws banks can no longer take away your 0% if u are late with ur payment ( it’s not  a special feature of the slate cards its the law to all cards ). so has a consumer study your options , figure out if the cards u already have offer promos , fees, find out what is ur annual % rate u are paying … do the math , if the  0% is for a year or more and u are paying more then what the  transaction fee is … don’t be afraid  it’s only money after all….Chase Slate is definately a good card for most people with a good credit history , the sad thing is that most people in this country that need to transfer balances don’t have a very stellar or even good credit (most of the time below 700) that will not be approved for this card .  the things to consider if u are not fortunate to get this card  that there are other  options for u . use cards that u already have ( so u don’t get a hit on ur credit to open a new one ) that already offer promos on the existing card , even if u pay a 3% fee to bring a bal ance that u have at 15.00% it still going  going to save u 12% annually , and if the rate is for more then 1 year the better savings you will have .

I tried to take advantage of this offer and here’s what they don’t tell you.  The only way you are going to get approved for balance transfer is if you have an available credit line that matches the total amount of the debt you are trying to transfer.  in other words, if you think they will approve the transfer with your current debt to income ratio, it’s not going to happen.  What they will do is simply approve and send you yet another credit card with an available balance only as large as your remaining available credit at an astronomical percentage rate.  I did not need another card and the way they process this is like doubling down on your debt.  I had to make several calls to cancel the credit card I did not ask for.Don’t fall for this marketing scam.  I tried to take advantage of this offer and here’s what they don’t tell you.

However in general the credit card companies have become extremely tight about issuing anyone a new credit card.    I would try to go to a  Credit Union to get rid of that 27% credit card by rolling it over to one of their cards which are almost always a much lower rate like 10 – 16% which makes a huge difference.    I feel your pain, but you’re only hurting your own credit score by applying multiple times within a 6 mos period (much less a 4 week period).   The way to beat the card companies is to understand their game, and beat them at it.

The best way is through debt laddering (also called debt stacking), a process in which one commits to pay each month the present total of the individual payments, usually paying off first the card with the highest interest rate and applying the amount to the next card, and so on.

  the transfers have to be done in the first 60 days after the act is open to be able to have the fee waived, the 0% APR is good for 21 months ( not 60 days) . Balance Transfers can help someone pay down their credit card debt even with a fee because if u are paying a 14% interest on a balance and u are paying 3%  to trf to a 0%  for 12 months it would be like reducing your APR from to 3%… duhhhhh obvious savings . be smart and make it work for you .to: Ed Cott

The Chase card has a little under $2,000.00 on it.  The Juniper card has a little over $3,000.00 on it.  I called both credit card companies to ask about lowering my interest rate since I have been a long time customer and I always pay my bill on time.  Juniper took a few seconds and looked at my account and lowered it on the phone by 5% and also took away my interest charges for that months bill!!  A few days later I got a letter from them that explained that after reviewing my account they lowered it another 2%!!  When I called Slate, where I have the lower amount due, they told me they could not do anything for me.  I even told them I would close the account and put the credit on a different credit card with a lower interest rate.  They still chose to do nothing.

  To me it is not good to be switching credit cards continuously.  the best thing to avoid interest is to pay your balance each month, we do and never pay interest.  We use a rewards card and use the rewards to buy discounted gift cards.  Our other chioce is the finacial institutionof our choice offers a higher interst rate if we use the debit card the request number of times monthly.  We try to keep our crdit balance at less than $1K/mo to make it easier to pay.  Hence we cut ourselves off near the billing date.  (Sometimes needs come up and it is not possible to use a lower balance, but we STILL pay the balance each month).  That is the BEST way to pay no interest.  If you need a loan got to your bank or Credit Union and get a much lower interst rate there.I left a comment earlier, but the “captcha” gave an error, so I lost the comment altogether.

Get a card (if you qualify of course) and use the card, you get money back to use as you please.To add to my previous comment: The best ones are also those credit cards that besides the 0% on purchases for a long period of time the even give you cash back, imagine making purchases that will have to make no matter what paying cash.

I is not like borrowing money and never pay back. If you are about financing be careful.

  I have use this kinds of credit card offers for more than 15 years with very good results, even if I have to pay a 3% transaction fee, (which most of the time I do not) is worth it, you can use that money to buy a car,  remodel your home  or invest it to avoid interest on a loan . I have used as much as 4 credit card offers at the same time  for the down payment on a house, fix the house and then put it for rent then I start saving the money to pay it back some of the cards ( I also work on the side) when you pay the card back you will usually get another offer to use the money again or   if I get another new card offer I just transfer the  balances I have to the new one for another 12 or 18 months.

  and use only cash, do not know exactly how and what do credit cards work for us.
  First of all, we can only cut up our cards if our cards are all paid up, i.e. there’s
  no balance at all to pay, in which case, we shouldn’t even be in this conversation
  at all. Second, for those with only enough funds to pay for our monthly expenses
  and not enough to pay down debt, then it’s essential that we pay down our debt first
  and cut back on our expenses, for as long as it takes to pay off our balances. Once
  that’s done, then we must always ensure that we settle our credit card balances
  in full every month (which is what I told my grown-up kids that they must do), to
  build up our credit score and obtain the lowest rates and best terms whenever we
  need to purchase anything through financing. America is the only country in the
  world where we can purchase a house and/or a car without having cash to pay for
  them, provided our credit score is high and our credit history is great, which I
  recently did for my son and my daughter, who bought a house and a car each (not
  at the same time but spread over 6-months interval for each purchase) without any
  cash (which they couldn’t believe) but using the purchase checks from the banks’
  credit cards. I’ve got 3 cards with more than $20K each and they keep sending me
  these purchase checks, which I used to provide funds for my son’s closing costs
  (although I had to pay 2% fee and 3% fee for two of them and the third was free
  but all 0% APR for 16months). I told them to buy the houses for less than $150K
  (if they’re going to live in them for at least 5yrs), instead of paying rising rent
  on their apts, and build up their equity, so that they can purchase another house
  in future. The bottomline is that, whatever funds we have every month should be
  used to pay down our balances and then, charge everything we spend to our credit
  cards, BUT ensuring that we spend less every month than what we pay, i.e. our total
  balances must be reduced every month, so that we can save our monthly interests
  and pay off our balances. There’re two things always to take note of, viz. (1) pay
  more to cards with the highest interest and/or lowest balance first; (2) if our
  credit score is very good, we can apply for the 0% cards every six months (with
  more than 12 months 0% APR) and transfer our highest interest balance to this new
  card. If the new card doesn’t have enough credit limit to do much good, then use
  50% to transfer balances and charge the other 50% for your new expenses (avoid maxing
  it) and make sure that we pay at least 25% of our monthly balances, so that we’ll
  have enough credit for the following month’s expenses and after 3 to 6 months, the
  bank will increase the credit limit on our new card, without asking for any increase,
  which is usually 20% at least (which won’t happen if we use the full limit to transfer
  balances because banks must earn money from our purchases for that to happen). My
  son’s Slate card increased his credit limit from $3K to $6K because I told him not
  to use more than 20% every month and pay the balance in full, which also helped
  him to pay for the renovation expenses for his new house. I hope this helps, but
  please seek clarification if in doubt. God bless.For those like Ed & DL, who advocate

  lower than credit card rates. If you don’t own yet get your credit rating to where

Was allowed a $4,900 transfer with 13 months at 0% interest, 0% transfer fee.  Even transferring that amount helped a lot.  I paid it off faithfully every month – sometimes the minimum, but most of the time much more.  I paid it all off (including additional purchases) fully before the deadline.  I had no trouble with Chase – although I had read there could be.  I did all transactions online and made payments by bank transfer from my checking account at another bank.

I did balance transfers, no problems and the full credit line was available for transfers. If you are having problems with transfers, call them. I wouldn’t cancel a credit card, unless there is a ridiculous yearly fee and low credit limit. Having a credit card and using it responsibly is the best way to go. I filed bankruptcy in 2003. It took 11 years before I got approved for credit. I did have one card, Orchard Bank, now CreditOne. I used it monthly on Arrowhead water delivery, I never paid it off each month, just shy of paying it off, say $1.00-$2.00 left each month. It showed, once my bankruptcy was off of my record, that I was in good standing for around 7 years. If you have a credit card and don’t use it, no good credit is reported. If you pay a credit card bill off completely each month, again, no help. But a monthly credit, showing that it’s being used and is in good standing, that’s what creditors want to see. Also, if you’ve had a credit card for a while and say had a late payment and your interest went up, wait about six months and then contact company and ask if the negative can be removed. You can also call to request a credit line increase. You can also call and ask if your interest rate can be lowered. Another thing, if you start getting loads of credit offers, do your homework on the company, their reputation, find message boards or BBB reviews. Also, if you apply for a credit card, it dings your credit score, even if approved. So don’t apply for a bunch of cards around the same time, space them apart because this also doesn’t look good on your credit report. Most importantly, don’t go and buy things just because you have a credit card with a $5,000 limit or more or less. Use your credit cards within your financial means, just because you have that credit card with that limit, doesn’t mean you go on a shopping spree. Lastly, make more than your monthly payment, double it or more if you can. If you pay by check (who uses checks anymore? Right) send a letter with each payment, and I mean every single payment that says “Please Note: ALL extra monies sent with this payment are to be put towards the principle of the loan.”. Do this with car, mortgage or other types of payments/loans that you have, including credit cards, that have interest rates. This pays down your principle faster and with much less interest. For instance, I purchased a used car in 2008, sticker price was $8,000. Add taxes, insurance and a 72 month loan, total price for that used car after 72 months, $18,000. I made double payments usually, sometimes triple payments. Occasionally I could only pay the monthly payment of $250.00. I got the car in late 2008, first payment due January 2009. I would have finished paying off this car in January this year if I just made the monthly payment. Instead, I had it paid off in just under 2 years. I had the option to make payments online, I didn’t because the online payments do not give you an option of saying “Any and all extra monies sent are to be placed on the principal of the loan.” What would have cost me $18,000 if I’d made minimum payments monthly, cost me around $10,500 total. I saved approximately $7,500. You do the math guys. If you have credit cards that you pay online and have opted out of paper statements, change that now, insist on paper statements (unless you can print out the payment slip from the statement (you can on many) and even if you cannot double a payment, maybe you can add $5-$20 to your minimum payment due, sent a check and EVERY SINGLE PAYMENT, add a hand written note “To Whom it May Concern, Any and all extra monies sent are to be placed towards the Principal of the loan. Sincerely, (enter your name here)”. Take a picture of the Statement your check and your note. I’ve even written on the front of the check itself those same words, but it can be hard to read sometimes, I wrote it in and/or under the “note” section of the check, but paper is better. Get a small notebook 5″ x 3″ or close to it. Good Luck! I wish you all the best of luck. I hope that I have helped some of you out.

Well, I was approved for a credit card but it was for a measly $800 credit limit. ??? I was shocked by such a low credit line. The next smallest line of credit that I have is $3000.I almost didn’t transfer anything over and just close the account instead, but I decided what the heck, with no balance transfer fee, I might as well transfer money over and use the card until the 0% interest runs out, then close the card. So next month, when the card is paid off in full (a month before the 0% interest rate runs out) I will go ahead and close the account. An $800 credit line just isn’t worth worrying about.YMMV.I applied for a Chase Slate credit card so I could do a balance transfer to the account.

If you have poor credit (usually indicative of a bad credit score) you will not get the deals that are touted.2 a person who signs up for something and it turns out to be something different.  The laws regarding disclosure for credit card agreements and loans are very specific and set up for the overly ignorant.  If you read the print (not the fine print) the print, you’ll know the deal.  Most people don’t do this and then they blame the creditor for their failure to read and understand what they are signing up for.3 a person who buys on credit what they shouldn’t.  If you don’t have the means to pay something off within a reasonable time, and its not a real asset, then don’t use credit.  Otherwise, you will be in an endless cycle of debt.  I understand how hard this is but it requires living below your means and waiting until you have the funds.

I have one in my wallet.  I maybe used it once when I needed a roof repair of $1,200 and later when the whole roof was falling apart, Slate didn’t help me.   As a matter of fact, they only would lend me $500 and had to pay it back in 2 months for the repair.  And, I have had my mortgage at Chase for years.   They wouldn’t even give me a home improvement loan.  Wouldn’t a roof be an improvement if it was falling apart?   I finally went to Enerbank and they lent me $3,500, no interest, for one year, same as cash.  Steer clear of this card.   Check out all the small print.  Bogus card.

I applied and was accepted for a Barclay card offering 0% for 14 months. It turned out to be 14 days, apparently. The first 1/2 month had no interest, but the next month had interest charged at 24.99%. I would NEVER have applied for nor accepted this rate had I known. They were supposed to email me with the terms, which I should have printed before I completed the application, but never did. I also never received them in the mail. I was never provided them until after my second billing. This turned out to be a real bait and switch. I cancelled the card and will pay it off asap.You need to be careful with Barclay.

He decided to use this card to transfer a balance.Please know: There is no way to set this card up on any kind of automatic payment system. I understand they’re running a business and they want to doc you every time you slip up, but it seemed a little obvious. Also, when they raised the balance, they messed up the transfer, so he had to make a much larger initial payment than was originally arranged. He won’t be using it beyond the current balance. Kinda unimpressed for what it is.I’m helping my boyfriend to consolidate, and I read all about this card. He decided to use this card to transfer a balance.

If your customers won’t pay the extra 5% that you tack on for the credit card charge then post a cash/credit price notice on the store’s door or inform the customer at the register. There are plenty of us “small business owner’s” (me included) that have found ways to adjust to the on going slump in the economy. The first is to notify your state’s Small Business Association of your need for representation in Congress. Then YOU need to get out and protest, organize and vote for a progressive candidate that realizes that America runs on small business enterprise and HOLD THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE! Too often we think this party or that party is our salvation. Well what does it feel like now that you have been saved? Banks own this country when it should be “WE THE PEOPLE”. WE are the government but instead we have allowed our elected to turn government into BIG business and THEY make all the money and never have to pay for credit because we the small business and taxpaying middle class subsidize them in lots of ways with our tax money.

  Several have said Pay it Off.

They just verify address and assign a uselessly low limit like $1200.   Maybe after the 60 days when the $0 balance transfer fee expires, they raise the limit to something usable.

After that time period there is a balance transfer fee, but within the first 60 days it is completely free to transfer your balances onto Chase Slate. It sounds like you might have transferred your balance after the 60 day period was up, thus incurring a fee.Best,

  TashaAfter 5 offers by mail, I wanted it and to transfer $3,000 at the beginning. They approved $2.350 and transferred $2,300 making it a maxed out credit card which hurt my credit score with 40 points in 2 months.After 5 offers by mail, I wanted it and to transfer $3,000 at the beginning.

I transferred a balance to Slate and it cost me 2% balance trans fee and it was only a year long. You cannot find a card anymore that doesn’t charge that fee and 2% is as low as it gets. I did do a transfer before using a Discover card for 15 months but that was for 3%. And I’ve got excellent credit, 770.This is totally wrong.

I have several “inactive active” cards in my desk. They send low transfer offers all the time. I might transfer a balance here and there after a large purchase to take advantage of the 0%. You just have to realize that these cards are destined never to be swiped through a card reader. If you transfer a balance, you CAN NOT put other purchases on it. Screws everything up. Set up a payment plan for 1 month short of the promotional rate, set up automatic payments for at least the minimum (to cover the “oops, the due date slipped by and now I’m at 25%) and carry on. It’s not hard and you’re not going to burn in h-e double hockey sticks for doing it.I have no problem using somebody else’s money for 12 or 15 months at no (or very low) cost.

Paying off your balance EVERY month is the only smart thing you can do with a credit card. Don’t pay what you don’t have. If you use a credit card as an extension of your checking account (i.e. paying it off regularly), then you should be fine, but most people don’t, and credit card companies are literally banking on you not paying the full balance each month. Just avoid plastic if you want to master your money.Hahaha. Don’t get a credit card! Transferring your card balance every 15 months is idiotic.

They have raise the rate on the card and it never goes down nor is they a way to request that they reevaluate the rate.  After being in the hospital for back surgery several years ago I made a single payment $50 less than the minimum.  They said I was in default and raised the rate to the max.  My credit score is in the mid 700’s but Chase will still not lower the rate.  I made the mistake of transferring my debt to their card to get their special low interest now I am stuck.  No one will give me an unsecure credit line high enough to transfer off the debt from the Slate card.I have had a chase card for many years and would do anything to get rid of it.

Have had issues with every other bank, but enjoy the level of service and attention to veterans at Chase.com  @HartmanPK.comI’ve had a number of credit cards and the two credit cards from Chase are the ones I have had no issues with.  For the people who complained about Chase changing terms, they need to understand what the offer is.  Chase is right up front indicating no fees for balance transfers the first 60 days.  That is exactly what is offered…transfer in the first 60 days and there is no fee.  No tricks.  Unfortunately, some people forget and let the 60 days slip up on them.  That may even be part of the reason a credit card company will offer a deal such as this one, because they can look at statistics and see just what percentage of account holders will forget about the 60 day offer and let it pass.  That, however, doesn’t make the company evil.

It’s one of the biggest perks of having this card, as most other cards do charge a balance transfer fee. However, if you transfer your balance after the first 60 days it’s true you will probably pay a balance transfer fee. It sounds like this might have been the situation in your case, which is unfortunate.Best,

  good advice, but the article seems to an advertisement for Chase.Right after the
  holidays most people have racked up a balance on their credit cards and are wondering
  how they are going to pay it off. Chase Slate is a strong solution, offering a 15-month
  0% APR on both balance transfers and purchases. Many cards offer a 0% intro APR,
  but the best part about Slate is that you won’t pay any balance transfer fees to
  move your balance(s) onto this card. That’s a huge win, since these fees are typically
  3% of the balance you’re transferring, which can add up to big money. For example,
  if you’re transferring $5,000 you’d probably pay $150 in fees with other cards.
  With Slate you pay absolutely nothing to transfer your money, and you have 15 interest-free
  months to make payments against the balance, which means you can pay it down completely
  or at least get a head start on reducing it. Just make sure you transfer your balance
  in the first 60 days to take advantage of the $0 balance transfer fee, as after
  that time there will be a fee.In addition to the 0% intro APR on balance transfers,
  you’ll also pay no interest for 15 months on purchases. This is a great way to make
  any big (or small) purchases you need and save money on interest fees for over a
  year. Plus, Slate has no annual fee and a fairly low ongoing APR after the 0% intro
  APR period which is important if you plan to carry a balance after the 15 months
  are up.Another huge point in Slate’s favor is that it’s available to those with
  good credit. A good credit score is typically considered to be above 660. Usually
  credit cards with the best offers are only available to people with excellent credit
  histories, but Slate has all the great features offered to excellent credit consumers
  and is open to those with merely good credit. So if you’ve missed a payment or two,
  or had some other minor hits on your credit report you will likely still qualify
  for this card. Of course, Slate also considers other factors like your annual salary
  and wages, your other annual income and a review of your debt, but in general those
  with good credit have a good shot.World travelers will appreciate that Slate now
  offers Chip and PIN technology. Chip-enabled cards are usually required when traveling
  outside the U.S., and if your card doesn’t have one you might not be able to use
  it when traveling internationally.Things To ConsiderChase Slate is a smart way to
  gradually pay down your balance over the course of the 15-month 0% intro APR period,
  and after the no-interest period is up it continues to offer reasonable ongoing
  APRs. However, if you think you might be carrying your balance for a prolonged time,
  Barclay Ring Mastercard might be a better solution for you. It doesn’t have a 0%
  intro APR period, but features no balance transfer fee, no annual fee and a one
  of the lowest ongoing APRs we’ve ever seen â\x80\x93 8.00% . Plus it gives you 1%
  back on the amount you transfer.Slate’s chip-enabled card makes it easy to travel
  internationally, but there is a 3% foreign transaction fee for each purchase you
  make. This fee can add up, particularly if you’re taking a long vacation and charging
  most purchases onto your card. If this is a deal-breaker for you, BankAmericard
  Travel Rewards Credit Card is an alternative to Slate that features no foreign transaction
  fees, no annual fee, 1.5 reward points for every dollar spent and a 12-month 0%
  intro APR.Although Slate is a great balance transfer card, it doesn’t offer any
  rewards. If you’re interested in a balance transfer card that also has strong cash
  back rewards, take a look at the Discover it â\x80\x93 Balance Transfer card which
  has a 18-month 0% intro APR, 5% cash back in categories that rotate quarterly, 1%
  cash back on everything else and no annual fee  (note: the card does have a 3% balance
  transfer fee).Should You Apply For the Slate from Chase?Chase Slate is a very strong
  card and is unique in that it lets you transfer your existing balances free of charge
  and pay no interest for 15 months on balance transfers and purchases. We highly
  recommend Chase Slate, and it is our best-ranked balance transfer card. It’s particularly
  appealing because it’s available to those with good (rather than just excellent)
  credit and features the chip-and-PIN technology that’s so important when traveling
  overseas.There are some potential drawbacks though, including no rewards and a foreign
  transaction fee. If these are concerns for you, check out the above-mentioned alternatives.

  Just make sure you transfer your balance in the first 60 days to take advantage
  of the $0 balance transfer fee, as after that time there will be a fee.In addition
  to the 0% intro APR on balance transfers, you’ll also pay no interest for 15 months
  on purchases. This is a great way to make any big (or small) purchases you need
  and save money on interest fees for over a year. Plus, Slate has no annual fee and
  a fairly low ongoing APR after the 0% intro APR period which is important if you
  plan to carry a balance after the 15 months are up.Another huge point in Slate’s
  favor is that it’s available to those with good credit. A good credit score is typically
  considered to be above 660. Usually credit cards with the best offers are only available
  to people with excellent credit histories, but Slate has all the great features
  offered to excellent credit consumers and is open to those with merely good credit.

  report you will likely still qualify for this card. Of course, Slate also considers
  other factors like your annual salary and wages, your other annual income and a
  review of your debt, but in general those with good credit have a good shot.World

- "Right after the holidays most people have racked up a balance on their credit cards
  and are wondering how they are going to pay it off. Chase Slate is a strong solution,
  offering a 15-month 0% APR on both balance transfers and purchases. Many cards offer
  a 0% intro APR, but the best part about Slate is that you won’t pay any balance
  transfer fees to move your balance(s) onto this card. That’s a huge win, since these
  fees are typically 3% of the balance you’re transferring, which can add up to big
  money. For example, if you’re transferring $5,000 you’d probably pay $150 in fees
  with other cards. With Slate you pay absolutely nothing to transfer your money,
  and you have 15 interest-free months to make payments against the balance, which
  means you can pay it down completely or at least get a head start on reducing it.
  Just make sure you transfer your balance in the first 60 days to take advantage
  of the $0 balance transfer fee, as after that time there will be a fee.In addition
  to the 0% intro APR on balance transfers, you’ll also pay no interest for 15 months
  on purchases. This is a great way to make any big (or small) purchases you need
  and save money on interest fees for over a year. Plus, Slate has no annual fee and
  a fairly low ongoing APR after the 0% intro APR period which is important if you
  plan to carry a balance after the 15 months are up.Another huge point in Slate’s
  favor is that it’s available to those with good credit. A good credit score is typically
  considered to be above 660. Usually credit cards with the best offers are only available
  to people with excellent credit histories, but Slate has all the great features
  offered to excellent credit consumers and is open to those with merely good credit.
  So if you’ve missed a payment or two, or had some other minor hits on your credit
  report you will likely still qualify for this card. Of course, Slate also considers
  other factors like your annual salary and wages, your other annual income and a
  review of your debt, but in general those with good credit have a good shot.World
  travelers will appreciate that Slate now offers Chip and PIN technology. Chip-enabled
  cards are usually required when traveling outside the U.S., and if your card doesn’t
  have one you might not be able to use it when traveling internationally.Things To
  ConsiderChase Slate is a smart way to gradually pay down your balance over the course
  of the 15-month 0% intro APR period, and after the no-interest period is up it continues
  to offer reasonable ongoing APRs. However, if you think you might be carrying your
  balance for a prolonged time, Barclay Ring Mastercard might be a better solution
  for you. It doesn’t have a 0% intro APR period, but features no balance transfer
  fee, no annual fee and a one of the lowest ongoing APRs we’ve ever seen â\x80\x93
  8.00% . Plus it gives you 1% back on the amount you transfer.Slate’s chip-enabled
  card makes it easy to travel internationally, but there is a 3% foreign transaction
  fee for each purchase you make. This fee can add up, particularly if you’re taking
  a long vacation and charging most purchases onto your card. If this is a deal-breaker
  for you, BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is an alternative to Slate that
  features no foreign transaction fees, no annual fee, 1.5 reward points for every
  dollar spent and a 12-month 0% intro APR.Although Slate is a great balance transfer
  card, it doesn’t offer any rewards. If you’re interested in a balance transfer card
  that also has strong cash back rewards, take a look at the Discover it â\x80\x93

  a long vacation and charging most purchases onto your card. If this is a deal-breaker
  for you, BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is an alternative to Slate that
  features no foreign transaction fees, no annual fee, 1.5 reward points for every
  dollar spent and a 12-month 0% intro APR.Although Slate is a great balance transfer
  card, it doesn’t offer any rewards. If you’re interested in a balance transfer card
  that also has strong cash back rewards, take a look at the Discover it â\x80\x93
  Balance Transfer card which has a 18-month 0% intro APR, 5% cash back in categories
  that rotate quarterly, 1% cash back on everything else and no annual fee  (note:
  the card does have a 3% balance transfer fee).Should You Apply For the Slate from
  Chase?Chase Slate is a very strong card and is unique in that it lets you transfer
  your existing balances free of charge and pay no interest for 15 months on balance
  transfers and purchases. We highly recommend Chase Slate, and it is our best-ranked
  balance transfer card. It’s particularly appealing because it’s available to those
  with good (rather than just excellent) credit and features the chip-and-PIN technology
  that’s so important when traveling overseas.There are some potential drawbacks though,
  including no rewards and a foreign transaction fee. If these are concerns for you,
  check out the above-mentioned alternatives. You can also take advantage of our free
  Balance Transfer Calculator to see which card is the best choice for your particular
  situation.I agree with you Scott. However, people make mistakes. What lured you

  to pay cash you shouldn’t buy it (exception being your house).  Yes it takes a budget,

  had their SS # stolen. You can do a fraud alert on the credit bureaus for yourself
  & no on can open an account in your name for 6 months. You can do it longer. You
  will have to ask how though? I’ve done it twice, as  I had some problems with internet
  security. Peace of mind to me that for 6 months no worries about anymore trying
  to open an account in my name. There is a 1-800 number, so google “putting a 6 month
  fraud alert on your credit bureau account, & credit cards, and it will give you
  the number. If I can’t pay the balance, then I don’t use the card, & pay in cash
  only. There are different Barclay credit cards, but Ringmaster was 8% for me. I
  am very bad at opening cards just to get cash awards back. I have too many cards
  because of it. I want to close some of them, as I don’t use them, but I heard it
  will lower my credit score if I do?Barclay Ringmaster is a good card. 8% interest.

  I use mine almost every day.  I have not paid interest in over 20 years, and my

  to charge a couple of thousand dollars worth of women’s clothes â\x80¦. that sank

  the only way to fight this is to maintain my bad credit so they can’t keep using

  at all.  I applied and only got a lousy $2,500 credit limit.  What good is that?
  \ I called and asked for a higher limit and was declined.  I have excellent credit
  with not one negative mark going back 20 years.  Today I cancelled it and the customer
  service rep asked why.  I explained that the low credit limit was of no use and
  that I had been declined for a higher limit.  She showed no concern and was only
  too happy to proceed in canceling my unused account.  Don’t waste your time with

  When they purchased the original company who owned my card. My rate jumped from
  20% to 26.24% and decreased my credit line. How disappointing and I was paying on
  time as well. Gonna think twice when I use this card. At no time have I been able
  to get them to lower the rate even though for close to 8 years I have paid on time.
  The interest that accumulates on the card is outrageous though I enjoy the Blueprint
  program which the other company didn’t have.\n"

  Its was too hard to get a card after going through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and getting a credit card 2 years later. Now for those who are trying to get a card they are really tough I heard…. but looking for a new card w/zero interest….I’m going with Capital One who was generous to give me twice the credit line than Chase and 24% w/ zero interest for 12 months with 3% transfer fee. Of course I will keep my Chase card using it once a month just to keep it active because I have a long credit history of 8 years.

  Slate: Your Best Bet for Balance Transfers?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby
  Tasha Lockyer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary 2, 2015\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUpdated:
  November 16, 2015\nThere are a lot of balance transfer credit cards out there, designed
  specifically for anyone who is carrying a balance on their credit card and paying
  high (or any) interest fees each month. In fact, there are so many it can be challenging
  to determine how one is better or worse than the others. Chase Slate is one of the
  cards vying for your business, and we took an in-depth look at this card to answer
  the question “is it any good?” The short answer is yes, it’s a great choice that
  can save you hundreds or thousands of dollars if you’re currently paying interest
  on another credit card.Â  It’s the only card we’ve found with the combination of
  a lengthy 0% intro APR and no balance transfer fee. The in-depth answer, as well
  as the card’s pros and cons, is explained below.\nThe Highlights\nRight after the
  holidays most people have racked up a balance on their credit cards and are wondering
  how they are going to pay it off. Chase Slate is a strong solution, offering a 15-month
  0% intro APR on both balance transfers and purchases. Many cards offer a 0% intro
  APR, but the best part about Slate is that you won’t pay any balance transfer fees
  to move your balance(s) onto this card. That’s a huge win, since these fees are
  typically 3% of the balance you’re transferring, which can add up to big money.
  For example, if you’re transferringÂ $10,000 you’d probably pay $300 in fees with
  other cards. With SlateÂ you pay absolutely nothing to transfer your money, and
  you have 15Â interest-free months to make payments against the balance, which canÂ give
  you even bigger savings. For example, if you were making $700Â monthly payments
  on that $10,000 balance and had a 20% interest rate,Â it would take you 17 months
  to pay it off and you’d pay over $1,500 inÂ interest. If you transferred that balance
  to Slate, you’d pay it offÂ in 15 months with no interest, saving $1,500 and paying
  absolutely noÂ fees.Â Just make sure you transfer your balance in the first 60 days
  to take advantage of the $0 balance transfer fee, as after that time there will
  be a fee.\nIn addition to the 0% intro APR on balance transfers, you’ll also pay
  no interest for 15 months on purchases. This is a great way to make any big (or
  small) purchases you need and save money on interest fees for over a year. Plus,
  Slate has no annual fee and a fairly low ongoing APR after the 0% intro APR period
  which is important if you plan to carry a balance after the 15 months are up.\nIf
  you’ve been known to make a late payment or two you’ll appreciate that Slate has
  no penalty APR. This means your interest rate won’t increase if your payment is
  delayed. We don’t recommend habitually paying your bill late, but it’s nice to know
  if it does happens you won’t be penalized for it.\nAnother huge point in Slate’s
  favor is that it’s available to those with good credit. A good credit score is typically
  considered to be above 660.Â Usually credit cards with the best offers are only
  available to people with excellent credit histories, but Slate has all the great
  features offered to excellent credit consumers and is open to those with merely
  good credit. So if you’ve missed a payment or two, or had some other minor hits
  on your credit report you will likely still qualify for this card. Of course, Slate
  also considers other factors like your annual salary and wages, your other annual
  income and a review of your debt, but in general those with good credit have a good
  shot.\nWorld travelers will appreciate that Slate nowÂ offers Chip and PIN technology.
  Chip-enabled cards are usually required when traveling outside the U.S., and if
  your card doesn’t have one you might not be able to use it when traveling internationally.\nThings
  To Consider\nChase Slate is a smart way to gradually pay down your balance over
  the course of the 15-month 0% intro APR period, and after the no-interest period
  is up it continues to offer reasonable ongoing APRs. However, if you think you might
  be carrying your balance for a prolonged time, Barclaycard Ring Mastercard might
  be a better solution for you. It doesn’t have a 0% intro APR period, but features
  no balance transfer fee, no annual fee and a one of the lowest ongoing APRs we’ve
  ever seen – 8.00% .\nIf a 15-month 0% intro APR isn’t quite enough, but you think
  you can pay down your balance in under 2 years, consider Citi Simplicity. ItÂ has
  an incredibly lengthy 21-month intro APR on balance transfers and purchases, which
  would give you an extra 6 months of 0% APR breathing room. There is a 3% balance
  transfer fee, but those 6 extra months might make it worthwhile.\nSlate’s chip-enabled
  card makes it easy to travel internationally, but there is a 3% foreign transaction
  fee for each purchase you make. This fee can add up, particularly if you’re taking
  a long vacation and charging most purchases onto your card. If this is a deal-breaker
  for you, BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit CardÂ is an alternative to Slate that
  features no foreign transaction fees, a 20,000 point intro bonus (worth $200 when
  you redeem towards travel), no annual fee, 1.5 reward points for every dollar spent
  and a 12-month 0% intro APR.\nAlthough Slate is a great balance transfer card, it
  doesn’t offer any rewards. If you’re interested in a balance transfer card that
  also has strong cash back rewards, take a look at the Discover it – Balance Transfer
  card which has a 18-month 0% intro APR on balance transfers, 5% cash back in categories
  that rotate quarterly (now through Dec 31st they are Amazon.com, department stores
  and clothing stores), 1% cash back on everything else and no annual fee (note: the
  card does have a 3% balance transfer fee). And as a very generous added bonus, you’ll
  get double cash back your first year! That means if you earn $300 in year one, Discover
  will give you another $300 for a total earnings of $600, which is pretty spectacular.
  Or if your credit history has a ding or two on it, consider Chase Freedom. Chase
  Freedom is available to those with just good credit (typically considered to be
  a credit score above 660), and itÂ features a 15-month 0% intro APR and up to 5%
  cash back in quarterly categories. Just in time for the holiday season those 5%
  categories are Amazon.com, Zappos.com, Audible.com and Diapers.com until December
  31st. And Chase Freedom just raised its intro bonus to a whopping $150 after you
  spend just $500 in the first three months, effectively over 30% cash back on your
  first $500 spent.\nShould You Apply For the Slate from Chase?\nChase Slate is a
  very strong card and is unique in that it lets you transfer your existing balances
  free of charge and pay no interest for 15 months on balance transfers and purchases.
  We highly recommend Chase Slate, and it is our best-ranked balance transfer card.
  It’s particularly appealing because it’s available to those with good (rather than
  just excellent) credit and features the chip-and-PIN technology that’s so important
  when traveling overseas.There are some potential drawbacks though, including no
  rewards and a foreign transaction fee. If these are concerns for you, check out
  the above-mentioned alternatives. You can also take advantage of our free Balance
  Transfer Calculator to see which card is the best choice for your particular situation.\nDisclaimer:

  for 15 month credit cards … then transferred all to chase slate for fifteen months
  zero interest and no transfer fees… zero interest ends May 16 on slate.\nGot about
  two years interest free keeping up with monthly payments of about 1%  of balance.

  \     \n\t  \n\t  \n\n      A good discussion of the positive features of the Chase
  card, but not the negative. I really should not call them negative, just features
  that make it less useful.\nI have a “good” credit score, but have several credit
  cards and carry a total balance of $50,000. (Don’t comment with your neither a borrow
  nor a lender be messages, this balance came about because of businesses I owned
  failing.)\nI pay a very high rate of interest on that $50,000 – averaging around
  25% a year.  A credit card with zero transfer fees and a low APR would be wonderful.
  However (and I have looked into this) if I apply one of these “great” credit cards
  I will be lucky to get a limit of $3000. While that would help, it is not a game
  changer. So I am stuck in a situation in which my low interest loan (house mortgage)
  is getting nicely paid off, it is hard to make a dent on the high interest ones.\n\n

  \     Unless you are in 20% or greater, just keep the card you have. Don’t use it
  ever again.  Pay 2X the minimum or more each month.  Pay it down until you can pay
  it off totally.  Don’t bother getting a zero interest transfer, you will just be
  tempted to use the old card.  Also pay yourself first.  Open a savings account and
  put some money aside every payday, even if $10 or $20.  Do it every paycheck and
  don’t touch.  Watch it grow.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n     \n      \n

  \ \n\t  \n\n      Is best to simply not have credit cards.  No one needs them.  I
  get around fine with my debit card and now  I actually have a real safety not fund
  that has a year’s salary in it, if I ever have a true emergency.  People live in
  debt and it has become acceptable, but if you have on major life event, there goes
  your house, there goes your car, there goes your life.  My suggestion, stop using
  credit cards, start paying off the small ones little by little.  Then start putting
  more money to pay off your home faster and pay off your car.  It’s amazing how big
  your take home pay becomes when you don’t have monthly debt payments on credit cards,
  a car, or even a house.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n     \n      \n

  \ \n\n      Oh yes.  If you have plenty of money, and don’t really have much debt,
  Chase Slate is for you.  They will be happy to let you transfer balance owed on
  another card.  However, my fiance, who has a credit score of 712, and ALWAYS pays
  his bills on time,  applied.  He wanted to transfer the balance from his Discover
  card (which I think was $15,000).  They refused him because they said he had too
  much debt (car payment, etc.)  What’s the point if all they want is people who hardly
  owe anything.  Slate sounded so good until we realized that they really don’t want
  to help those who really could use a few months of no interest while they continue
  to pay off a credit card balance!!!!!\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n

  \ \n\t  \n\n      Don’t fool yourself with balance transfers. If you can’t pay off
  your card balance when you get the statement don’t spend the money. You will have
  more money in the long run in your pocket instead of owing the money. Get cards
  that pay cash back or rewards with no yearly fees. Of course you have to build your
  credit score up to get these cards. I learned my lesson 15 years ago and have been
  raking in the cash rewards ever since.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n

  one but there are websites out there for credit cards for all types of credit and
  just try to find a zero interest card that you qualify for and don’t use it for
  any purchases. Even if it has a high interest and maybe only 12 month transfer.
  At least for  12 months you will be paying principle, just don’t miss any payments
  and your credit will improve. In time your score will improve and you can qualify
  for better cards with better benefits. If you buy a car and make payments on time
  yous credit score will sky rocket.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n     \n

  \ \n\n      You’re in debt because of Democrats? How funny. I’m in less Debt now
  then i was under Bush. Anyways A zero balance transfer card like the chase card
  being pitched on this article is a great way to pay down debt. Even if you can not
  get the balance fully paid off in the term agreement what i have done is roll over
  the remaining balance to another zero balance credit card. I currently use a American
  Express for my zero interest for 18 months. I will have the balance paid off with
  200 dollar payments each month by the time the term expires. The zero transfer fee
  is VERY huge on this card and when I decide to get another one of these types of
  cards i will apply.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n     \n      \n         \n

  \     it is great to transfer your balance to a new card with zero interest ONLY
  if you promise yourself not to use the new card for any new purchases at all. Why?
  \ Because the old debt you transfer to your new card will be used first to pay off
  while the new purchases you made will be last to pay off . What it means is that
  you will be stuck with your new balance accumulating interest charges without ability
  to pay it down at all until you pay off your old debt first.. it is a ZERO SUCKER
  TRAP! I was lucky to catch the dirty trick before accumulating too much new debt
  so I paid it off earlier than I liked to.. Never again!  But you can still transfer
  your old balance to your new zero interest card but REMEMBER NEVER TO USE THE CARD
  TO MAKE ANY NEW PURCHASES AT ALL!!  Use the new card to pay off your old debt at
  zero interest.. Don’t dally or goof around with it as zero interest will expire
  in 18 months or whatever it says ..   Use the time to pay off that  old debt … never
  use it to make new purchases !~! Pass this along to your friends  !\n\n      \n

  \ \n\t  \n\n      If you haven’t got one of these cards, you’ll have to be approved
  for a credit limit. If accepted, you can’t transfer an amount that’s more than 80%
  of that limit. When you request a balance transfer at the same time that you apply,
  you just have to sit back and wait for the verdict. If you’re asking to transfer
  $10,000 but they only approve you for a $10,000 limit, they’ll only transfer $8,000,
  leaving you to juggle the remainder. They base your limit on more than your credit
  score — household income is a big factor. And as noted, you can’t transfer balances
  from one card to another card with the same company. You might have to play a shell
  game, transferring a balance to a card with a different company then back, but if
  you try that, you might suddenly find that you’re ineligible for any balance transfer.\n\n

  get people out of debt?  Yes, life has some unexpected surprises, that’s why you
  must plan for them.  My debt was a medical emergency, but I paid that down like
  it was on fire, They would have eaten me alive on the interest collected.  Use them,

  than those with three credit cards.  But if you need a credit card, stay away from
  Synchony.  I made more than the regular payment and paid them off, during that time
  they lowered my credit limit (no problem), and when I paid them off, they closed
  my account (Can’t use them for reference, but they can’t erase my payment history).
  \ They were not happy because they were not able to collect their 27% + interest.
  \ These cards are known as “Poverty Traps”.   Instead of helping, it adds more burden
  and more debt.  Make a plan (Budget) and stick to it.  Don’t buy things you don’t
  need, you can still enjoy life. Things don’t make you happy, it may make things
  easier……but not happy.  Get your priorities straight  and you will be happy.\n\n

  a couple of things about Chase Slate – they do not accept complete balance transfers.
  \ There is a limit.  So, if you are looking to transfer a large amount and try to
  get it down quickly – you will be disappointed.  Then, all you will get out of it
  is an additional credit card – which is not good.  f you have another Chase Card
  that has a high interest – like we do – you can’t transfer or request to receive
  this card to get that amount down either.  Basically, this is not to help you get
  out of debt, but to trap you into owing them.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n

  \ \n\t  \n\n      Another card to consider for balance transfer options is the LLBean
  Visa Card.  The rewards are great if you are a huge fan of their products.  However,
  for around the past year or so, they have been offering balance transfer options
  of 0% APR for 15 months and only a 1% balance transfer fee.  The fee goes to 3%
  if you choose the 0% APR for 18 months.  $50 for a %5000 balance transfer basically
  pays itself after the first month.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n     \n

  advantage of making a transfer for 0% interest whether there is a transfer fee or
  not from any Credit Card company.  Consider to pay off at an extended time 15 months
  for CHASE or 21 months for CITI Simplicity.  A very high interest will apply thereafter.
  \  In the meantime, you should consider pay off new purchases on the bill.  Pay
  maximum to the one with highest interest. Pay minimum to the lowest one.  Think
  twice your shopping cart “Only buy the one you need, do not buy the one you want”.

  for parking high-interest debt. But balance transfers are slooooow, and the 60-day
  no-fee window closes fast. Thereafter it’s 3%, $5 minimum fee, so you would want
  to transfer a minimum of $167 to get the max efficiency from the fee.\n Chase Freedom
  has been doing 5% cash back on gas.  Speedway, formerly Hess, offers 10 cents a
  gallon off  when you use their Speedy Rewards card before you purchase.  Speedway
  is same price, cash or credit. In addition, Freedom offers another 3% cash back
  if you redeem your Freedom points for Lowe’s cards.  So that’s 10 cents a gallon
  off, plus 8% cash back  net at Lowes.\nCap One Quicksilver is a much faster balance
  transfer card. They have an annual fee, I think $39 0r $49, but no transfer fee
  thru March 2016. I pay $200 to the Quik card, and then do 4 separate $50 balance
  transfers to my other cards.  Balance transfers count as a payment, so on my credit
  report, my $200 becomes $400 in on-time payments.\nBE SURE YOU CHECK THE TERMS AND
  CONDITIONS OF ZERO-INTEREST OFFERS!\nMANY REQUIRE THAT THE BALANCE IS PAID OFF AT
  THE END OF THE PROMOTIONAL PERIOD, OR THEY WILL CHARGE YOU FULL INTEREST FROM DAY

  get into one of those programs that promise to help you. They will just screw you
  more, like freedom debt. They don’t work with your creditors, they just have you
  send them money and after they got a lot, then they intend to negotiate, mean while,
  your cards are not getting paid, and your credit score drops below 600. I know,

  \     This card will only give you $1000 to start with if you have average salary
  so you will not be able to transfer large balances as they promise. Opening any
  new credit card will hurt your credit score.  So, only open this if you can get
  by with very small transfer or make a lot of money.\n\n      \n               \n

  \     \n      \n\t  \n\t  \n\n      I saw this article before (at least something
  similar to it).   I applied because not only are my cards maxed, but I have two
  that are over 29% and are going nowhere fast.  Plus I have 2 cards that charged
  a late fee 0 which made it an over limit fee and I have been playing THAT circle
  game for almost a year.  How did I get like this??  I am on SSI disability and on
  Medicare and last year had breast cancer surgery. after 2 lumpectomies, I ended
  up having a double mastectomy and phase one reconstruction.  Bills kept coming in
  and charged everything so that I could get the medical refund on the taxes.  I was
  going to used the 0% card to pay off and destroy my 2 29% cards and get back under
  my max on the “circle” cards.   I have a 680 credit rating and was turned down for
  the very reason I wanted to do this.   Is there anyway I can get this offer – a
  way to appeal?? BTW..  I am 3months cancer free.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n

  \     \n\t  \n\t  \n\n      Most cards will charge you the entire interest if not
  paid by the drop dead date (15 months in this case).\nI did a thing when I built
  my house. I had many credit cards (generally which I didn’t use much and always
  paid them off). I had many offers of transfer balance, so I parlayed those offers
  into financing my construction. I created a spreadsheet to remind me when I needed
  to pay them  off. I would often pay one off w/ another and then sometimes back again.
  Ultimately, I paid them all off with my equity I gained from a house I sold and
  ultimately the rest when I sold the house I was living in and everything. I played
  their game to the hilt … and did OK … BUT … you have to manage those balance transfers
  very carefully. 0% and no balance transfer is key.\n\n      \n               \n

  not to have a credit card at all. Get rid of all of them. Next step, Google Dave
  Ramsey! He’ll wake you up. Trust me, I was sleeping for a long time!\n\n      \n

  \ \n\n      I agree with many of the people on here.  My husband passed away, I
  became disabled and now we/I  have enormace credit card debt.  Because of “LIFE”
  happening and having to pay bills I’m in debt.  I’ve never missed a payment, or
  had any other problems but now that I really need assistance no one is willing to
  give a person a chance.   I can’t believe that if you have always had excellent
  credit scores until “Life” happened it doesn’t make a difference.  Excellent past
  history doesn’t mean a thing, one one will  give me a chance to get my life back
  together again.    It’s sad that the USA will literally take a persons home if illness
  or death cause unforeseen expenses.   I probably shouldn’t say this but… Of course,
  if I came from another country I would get the medical for free.  Then I wouldn’t
  been in such a sad place.  To all the others in this situation, let’s pray for each
  other.  Nothing else seems to help.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n     \n

  fall for this again.  They all promise this and when it comes time to transfer an
  existing balance, they decline indicating the amount is too high – stating…you are
  a new customer to them so you have no payment history with them.  So then, you’re
  left juggling two credit cards because they generally only allow a balance transfer
  of half the amount, if that.   I think it’s false advertisement and Chase Bank is
  horrible to do business with.  I’ve heard a lot of complaints from friends and family.\n\n

  was that? Recenly I called them and requested a lower interest rate since my credit
  score is now very close to 700. My request was denied. I think my chase card interest
  rate right now is 26% now.  I transfered the balance to Citi card which I have 21
  months 0% interest and thereafter 15%. No late fee and no panelty APR (29%-31% like

  for many years. After my husband passed away, my income was suddenly $4,000 a month

  cards were cancelled by the credit card companies. Ever though I didn’t have a balance
  on them. SLATE was the only one that continued to give me credit. I am so grateful.

  \ \n\t  \n\n      Chase Slate is definately a good card for most people with a good
  credit history , the sad thing is that most people in this country that need to
  transfer balances don’t have a very stellar or even good credit (most of the time
  below 700) that will not be approved for this card .  the things to consider if
  u are not fortunate to get this card  that there are other  options for u . use
  cards that u already have ( so u don’t get a hit on ur credit to open a new one
  ) that already offer promos on the existing card , even if u pay a 3% fee to bring
  a bal ance that u have at 15.00% it still going  going to save u 12% annually ,
  and if the rate is for more then 1 year the better savings you will have . If the
  card you use for the transfers is an existing account and doesn’t have the 0% on
  purchases don’t use the card for purchases keep it separate . with the new credit
  card act passed in 2010 by President Obama a default Apr can only be applied to
  new purchases not the existing bal on the act , also with all credit cards due to
  new laws banks can no longer take away your 0% if u are late with ur payment ( it’s
  not  a special feature of the slate cards its the law to all cards ). so has a consumer
  study your options , figure out if the cards u already have offer promos , fees,
  find out what is ur annual % rate u are paying … do the math , if the  0% is for
  a year or more and u are paying more then what the  transaction fee is … don’t be
  afraid  it’s only money after all….\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n     \n

  \     Don’t fall for this marketing scam.  I tried to take advantage of this offer
  and here’s what they don’t tell you.  The only way you are going to get approved
  for balance transfer is if you have an available credit line that matches the total
  amount of the debt you are trying to transfer.  in other words, if you think they
  will approve the transfer with your current debt to income ratio, it’s not going
  to happen.  What they will do is simply approve and send you yet another credit
  card with an available balance only as large as your remaining available credit
  at an astronomical percentage rate.  I did not need another card and the way they
  process this is like doubling down on your debt.  I had to make several calls to
  cancel the credit card I did not ask for.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n

  \ \n\n      TO MR WILLIAM FREY – I am just another consumer with a small business
  (DBA) like you, and I wanted to let you know that (shockingly) the bank you bank
  with as a small business owner (in your case Chase) will now rarely give you a credit
  card (its some inside rule they have especially since you have other credit cards
  with them, it puts their bank in a position to bear too great a risk of detault
  since they (Chase) would be holding too great a percentage of your total debt (sounds
  like 100% of your debt is with Chase) — so you need to apply to a non-Chase credit
  card (like maybe one of the other cards listed in this article or wherever – just
  not Chase) – and 2nd, you should be applying multiple times for a credit card because
  each time you apply the bank will do a hard credit pull which tanks your credit
  (FICO) score — from the bank’s perspective they see you as desperate for credit
  (I know its idiotic but they’re banks!) — WHAT YOU NEED TO DO is STOP applying for
  credit cards — wait 6 mos to 9 mos before you apply for ANY  credit card (or ANY
  debt always wait 6-9 mos between applications) — then apply for a non-Chase credit
  card.   However in general the credit card companies have become extremely tight
  about issuing anyone a new credit card.    I would try to go to a  Credit Union
  to get rid of that 27% credit card by rolling it over to one of their cards which
  are almost always a much lower rate like 10 – 16% which makes a huge difference.
  \   I feel your pain, but you’re only hurting your own credit score by applying
  multiple times within a 6 mos period (much less a 4 week period).   The way to beat
  the card companies is to understand their game, and beat them at it.  Good luck.\n\n

  and I did the same thing again and today my FICO rating it is 788  which it is the
  highest that ever I had. I never pay interest of any of my credit cards. I do follow
  the offers and paying attention with all of them. Today I do have 21-21 credit cards
  but only 7-8 have a balance at 0% for 15 to 18 months offers. Good luck.\n\n      \n

  much and had a zero balance she was charged extortionate “service fees”, including
  for two years after her death.  In the end, I had to go in person to a Chase office
  in a different State to prove she had died, and they still charged fees to the card
  for another year.  And to cover the fees they over-drew her checking account, which

  a long time and I know this because it has changed names at least three times since
  I had it.  I also have a Juniper Master Card which I have also had for a long time.
  \ A few months ago when I was paying my bills I was disturbed at the amount of interest
  these cards are charging.  The Chase card has a little under $2,000.00 on it.  The
  Juniper card has a little over $3,000.00 on it.  I called both credit card companies
  to ask about lowering my interest rate since I have been a long time customer and
  I always pay my bill on time.  Juniper took a few seconds and looked at my account
  and lowered it on the phone by 5% and also took away my interest charges for that
  months bill!!  A few days later I got a letter from them that explained that after
  reviewing my account they lowered it another 2%!!  When I called Slate, where I
  have the lower amount due, they told me they could not do anything for me.  I even
  told them I would close the account and put the credit on a different credit card
  with a lower interest rate.  They still chose to do nothing.  Currently, the interest
  on the Slate card is 25.24%.  The interest on the Juniper card is 14.99% and if
  I were to transfer the balance from my Slate to the Juniper…  balance transfers
  are also 14.99%.  Which credit card do you think I’ll be  patronizing?\n\n      \n

  ething at teh end of my arm with fingers was my hand (what do I know?).\nTo me it
  is not good to be switching credit cards continuously.  the best thing to avoid
  interest is to pay your balance each month, we do and never pay interest.  We use
  a rewards card and use the rewards to buy discounted gift cards.  Our other chioce
  is the finacial institutionof our choice offers a higher interst rate if we use
  the debit card the request number of times monthly.  We try to keep our crdit balance
  at less than $1K/mo to make it easier to pay.  Hence we cut ourselves off near the
  billing date.  (Sometimes needs come up and it is not possible to use a lower balance,
  but we STILL pay the balance each month).  That is the BEST way to pay no interest.

  comment earlier, but the “captcha” gave an error, so I lost the comment altogether.
  \ This time I copied it before hand.   I though tth ething at teh end of my arm
  with fingers was my hand (what do I know?).\nTo me it is not good to be switching
  credit cards continuously.  the best thing to avoid interest is to pay your balance
  each month, we do and never pay interest.  We use a rewards card and use the rewards
  to buy discounted gift cards.  Our other chioce is the finacial institutionof our
  choice offers a higher interst rate if we use the debit card the request number
  of times monthly.  We try to keep our crdit balance at less than $1K/mo to make
  it easier to pay.  Hence we cut ourselves off near the billing date.  (Sometimes
  needs come up and it is not possible to use a lower balance, but we STILL pay the
  balance each month).  That is the BEST way to pay no interest.  If you need a loan
  got to your bank or Credit Union and get a much lower interst rate there.\n\n      \n

  to make no matter what paying cash. Get a card (if you qualify of course) and use

  \     Yes, it really helps to get an offer for a credit card with the 0% for a long
  time and even better if there is no balance transfer fee. but in order to make  use
  of that offer you must make sure to by the time the offer ends you will be able
  to pay off whatever money you took from it. I is not like borrowing money and never
  pay back. If you are about financing be careful.\nI have use this kinds of credit
  card offers for more than 15 years with very good results, even if I have to pay
  a 3% transaction fee, (which most of the time I do not) is worth it, you can use
  that money to buy a car,  remodel your home  or invest it to avoid interest on a
  loan . I have used as much as 4 credit card offers at the same time  for the down
  payment on a house, fix the house and then put it for rent then I start saving the
  money to pay it back some of the cards ( I also work on the side) when you pay the
  card back you will usually get another offer to use the money again or   if I get
  another new card offer I just transfer the  balances I have to the new one for another
  12 or 18 months.\nAs I said, do not think that is like money you borrow from your
  parents or brother and will be forget about it, do not borrow from anyone if you
  do not make a plan in how will you pay it back.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n

  \ \n\n      For those like Ed & DL, who advocate destroying credit cards and use
  only cash, do not know exactly how and what do credit cards work for us. First of
  all, we can only cut up our cards if our cards are all paid up, i.e. there’s no
  balance at all to pay, in which case, we shouldn’t even be in this conversation
  at all. Second, for those with only enough funds to pay for our monthly expenses
  and not enough to pay down debt, then it’s essential that we pay down our debt first
  and cut back on our expenses, for as long as it takes to pay off our balances. Once
  that’s done, then we must always ensure that we settle our credit card balances
  in full every month (which is what I told my grown-up kids that they must do), to
  build up our credit score and obtain the lowest rates and best terms whenever we
  need to purchase anything through financing. America is the only country in the
  world where we can purchase a house and/or a car without having cash to pay for
  them, provided our credit score is high and our credit history is great, which I
  recently did for my son and my daughter, who bought a house and a car each (not
  at the same time but spread over 6-months interval for each purchase) without any
  cash (which they couldn’t believe) but using the purchase checks from the banks’
  credit cards. I’ve got 3 cards with more than $20K each and they keep sending me
  these purchase checks, which I used to provide funds for my son’s closing costs
  (although I had to pay 2% fee and 3% fee for two of them and the third was free
  but all 0% APR for 16months). I told them to buy the houses for less than $150K
  (if they’re going to live in them for at least 5yrs), instead of paying rising rent
  on their apts, and build up their equity, so that they can purchase another house
  in future. The bottomline is that, whatever funds we have every month should be
  used to pay down our balances and then, charge everything we spend to our credit
  cards, BUT ensuring that we spend less every month than what we pay, i.e. our total
  balances must be reduced every month, so that we can save our monthly interests
  and pay off our balances. There’re two things always to take note of, viz. (1) pay
  more to cards with the highest interest and/or lowest balance first; (2) if our
  credit score is very good, we can apply for the 0% cards every six months (with
  more than 12 months 0% APR) and transfer our highest interest balance to this new
  card. If the new card doesn’t have enough credit limit to do much good, then use
  50% to transfer balances and charge the other 50% for your new expenses (avoid maxing
  it) and make sure that we pay at least 25% of our monthly balances, so that we’ll
  have enough credit for the following month’s expenses and after 3 to 6 months, the
  bank will increase the credit limit on our new card, without asking for any increase,
  which is usually 20% at least (which won’t happen if we use the full limit to transfer
  balances because banks must earn money from our purchases for that to happen). My
  son’s Slate card increased his credit limit from $3K to $6K because I told him not
  to use more than 20% every month and pay the balance in full, which also helped
  him to pay for the renovation expenses for his new house. I hope this helps, but
  please seek clarification if in doubt. God bless.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n

  have enough credit for the following month’s expenses and after 3 to 6 months, the
  bank will increase the credit limit on our new card, without asking for any increase,
  which is usually 20% at least (which won’t happen if we use the full limit to transfer
  balances because banks must earn money from our purchases for that to happen). My
  son’s Slate card increased his credit limit from $3K to $6K because I told him not
  to use more than 20% every month and pay the balance in full, which also helped
  him to pay for the renovation expenses for his new house. I hope this helps, but
  please seek clarification if in doubt. God bless.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n

  is lazy man’s wealth. 6. Debt is dangerous and destructive in tangible and intangible
  ways. 7.If things are out of control the first step is GET REAL.That means destroy
  the cards,close the accounts and start making payments. 8.Rough rule of thumb :
  If your minimum monthly payment is say $300 or whatever. . .keep paying THAT SAME
  AMOUNT every month and you will be out of debt.9.When you cut your cards and close
  the accounts your finances will hit the wall,work with what you got to pay rent
  food utilities and work out payment arrangements on the debts. 10.These are all

  card rates. If you don’t own yet get your credit rating to where you can get a personal

  Orchard Bank, now CreditOne. I used it monthly on Arrowhead water delivery, I never
  paid it off each month, just shy of paying it off, say $1.00-$2.00 left each month.
  It showed, once my bankruptcy was off of my record, that I was in good standing
  for around 7 years. If you have a credit card and don’t use it, no good credit is
  reported. If you pay a credit card bill off completely each month, again, no help.
  But a monthly credit, showing that it’s being used and is in good standing, that’s
  what creditors want to see. Also, if you’ve had a credit card for a while and say
  had a late payment and your interest went up, wait about six months and then contact
  company and ask if the negative can be removed. You can also call to request a credit
  line increase. You can also call and ask if your interest rate can be lowered. Another
  thing, if you start getting loads of credit offers, do your homework on the company,
  their reputation, find message boards or BBB reviews. Also, if you apply for a credit
  card, it dings your credit score, even if approved. So don’t apply for a bunch of
  cards around the same time, space them apart because this also doesn’t look good
  on your credit report. Most importantly, don’t go and buy things just because you
  have a credit card with a $5,000 limit or more or less. Use your credit cards within
  your financial means, just because you have that credit card with that limit, doesn’t
  mean you go on a shopping spree. Lastly, make more than your monthly payment, double
  it or more if you can. If you pay by check (who uses checks anymore? Right) send
  a letter with each payment, and I mean every single payment that says “Please Note:
  ALL extra monies sent with this payment are to be put towards the principle of the
  loan.”. Do this with car, mortgage or other types of payments/loans that you have,
  including credit cards, that have interest rates. This pays down your principle
  faster and with much less interest. For instance, I purchased a used car in 2008,
  sticker price was $8,000. Add taxes, insurance and a 72 month loan, total price
  for that used car after 72 months, $18,000. I made double payments usually, sometimes
  triple payments. Occasionally I could only pay the monthly payment of $250.00. I
  got the car in late 2008, first payment due January 2009. I would have finished
  paying off this car in January this year if I just made the monthly payment. Instead,
  I had it paid off in just under 2 years. I had the option to make payments online,
  I didn’t because the online payments do not give you an option of saying “Any and
  all extra monies sent are to be placed on the principal of the loan.” What would
  have cost me $18,000 if I’d made minimum payments monthly, cost me around $10,500
  total. I saved approximately $7,500. You do the math guys. If you have credit cards
  that you pay online and have opted out of paper statements, change that now, insist
  on paper statements (unless you can print out the payment slip from the statement
  (you can on many) and even if you cannot double a payment, maybe you can add $5-$20
  to your minimum payment due, sent a check and EVERY SINGLE PAYMENT, add a hand written
  note “To Whom it May Concern, Any and all extra monies sent are to be placed towards
  the Principal of the loan. Sincerely, (enter your name here)”. Take a picture of
  the Statement your check and your note. I’ve even written on the front of the check
  itself those same words, but it can be hard to read sometimes, I wrote it in and/or
  under the “note” section of the check, but paper is better. Get a small notebook
  5″ x 3″ or close to it. Good Luck! I wish you all the best of luck. I hope that
  I have helped some of you out.\nChristin Wilson\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n

  no problems and the full credit line was available for transfers. If you are having
  problems with transfers, call them. I wouldn’t cancel a credit card, unless there
  is a ridiculous yearly fee and low credit limit. Having a credit card and using

  \ \n\t  \n\n      You need to be careful with Barclay. I applied and was accepted
  for a Barclay card offering 0% for 14 months. It turned out to be 14 days, apparently.
  The first 1/2 month had no interest, but the next month had interest charged at
  24.99%. I would NEVER have applied for nor accepted this rate had I known. They
  were supposed to email me with the terms, which I should have printed before I completed
  the application, but never did. I also never received them in the mail. I was never
  provided them until after my second billing. This turned out to be a real bait and
  switch. I cancelled the card and will pay it off asap.\n\n      \n               \n

  “oh poor small business owner” meme is pathetic.  If your customers won’t pay the
  extra 5% that you tack on for the credit card charge then post a cash/credit price
  notice on the store’s door or inform the customer at the register. There are plenty
  of us “small business owner’s” (me included) that have found ways to adjust to the
  on going slump in the economy. The first is to notify your state’s Small Business
  Association of your need for representation in Congress. Then YOU need to get out
  and protest, organize and vote for a progressive candidate that realizes that America
  runs on small business enterprise and HOLD THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE! Too often we
  think this party or that party is our salvation. Well what does it feel like now
  that you have been saved? Banks own this country when it should be “WE THE PEOPLE”.
  WE are the government but instead we have allowed our elected to turn government
  into BIG business and THEY make all the money and never have to pay for credit because
  we the small business and taxpaying middle class subsidize them in lots of ways
  with our tax money. You’ve drank the “kool-aid” and don’t like the after taste.

  large purchase to take advantage of the 0%. You just have to realize that these

  problem using somebody else’s money for 12 or 15 months at no (or very low) cost.
  You just have to understand the conditions. I have several “inactive active” cards
  in my desk. They send low transfer offers all the time. I might transfer a balance
  here and there after a large purchase to take advantage of the 0%. You just have
  to realize that these cards are destined never to be swiped through a card reader.

  \ \n\n      Hahaha. Don’t get a credit card! Transferring your card balance every
  15 months is idiotic. Paying off your balance EVERY month is the only smart thing
  you can do with a credit card. Don’t pay what you don’t have. If you use a credit
  card as an extension of your checking account (i.e. paying it off regularly), then
  you should be fine, but most people don’t, and credit card companies are literally
  banking on you not paying the full balance each month. Just avoid plastic if you
  want to master your money.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n     \n      \n

  \     I’ve had a number of credit cards and the two credit cards from Chase are
  the ones I have had no issues with.  For the people who complained about Chase changing
  terms, they need to understand what the offer is.  Chase is right up front indicating
  no fees for balance transfers the first 60 days.  That is exactly what is offered…transfer
  in the first 60 days and there is no fee.  No tricks.  Unfortunately, some people
  forget and let the 60 days slip up on them.  That may even be part of the reason
  a credit card company will offer a deal such as this one, because they can look
  at statistics and see just what percentage of account holders will forget about
  the 60 day offer and let it pass.  That, however, doesn’t make the company evil.
  \ We just all need to read the fine print on offers and take advantage of the ones
  that can help us achieve what we all are trying to do….make our money reach further!\n\n

  points in 2 months. So DISGUSTING !!!\nI had one before and they stole me of $16
  ! When I was already to close it, they copy-paste and older charge, already paid
  2 weekS ago. with the same date. Identical !\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n

  cards that would not negotiate with me on my interest rate when I couldn’t afford

  after the holidays most people have racked up a balance on their credit cards and
  are wondering how they are going to pay it off. Chase Slate is a strong solution,
  offering a 15-month 0% APR on both balance transfers and purchases. Many cards offer
  a 0% intro APR, but the best part about Slate is that you won’t pay any balance
  transfer fees to move your balance(s) onto this card. That’s a huge win, since these
  fees are typically 3% of the balance you’re transferring, which can add up to big
  money. For example, if you’re transferring $5,000 you’d probably pay $150 in fees
  with other cards. With Slate you pay absolutely nothing to transfer your money,
  and you have 15 interest-free months to make payments against the balance, which
  means you can pay it down completely or at least get a head start on reducing it.
  Just make sure you transfer your balance in the first 60 days to take advantage
  of the $0 balance transfer fee, as after that time there will be a fee.\nIn addition
  to the 0% intro APR on balance transfers, you’ll also pay no interest for 15 months
  on purchases. This is a great way to make any big (or small) purchases you need
  and save money on interest fees for over a year. Plus, Slate has no annual fee and
  a fairly low ongoing APR after the 0% intro APR period which is important if you
  plan to carry a balance after the 15 months are up.\nAnother huge point in Slate’s
  favor is that it’s available to those with good credit. A good credit score is typically
  considered to be above 660. Usually credit cards with the best offers are only available
  to people with excellent credit histories, but Slate has all the great features
  offered to excellent credit consumers and is open to those with merely good credit.
  So if you’ve missed a payment or two, or had some other minor hits on your credit
  report you will likely still qualify for this card. Of course, Slate also considers
  other factors like your annual salary and wages, your other annual income and a
  review of your debt, but in general those with good credit have a good shot.\nWorld
  travelers will appreciate that Slate now offers Chip and PIN technology. Chip-enabled
  cards are usually required when traveling outside the U.S., and if your card doesn’t
  have one you might not be able to use it when traveling internationally.\nThings
  To Consider\nChase Slate is a smart way to gradually pay down your balance over
  the course of the 15-month 0% intro APR period, and after the no-interest period
  is up it continues to offer reasonable ongoing APRs. However, if you think you might
  be carrying your balance for a prolonged time, Barclay Ring Mastercard might be
  a better solution for you. It doesn’t have a 0% intro APR period, but features no
  balance transfer fee, no annual fee and a one of the lowest ongoing APRs we’ve ever
  seen â\x80\x93 8.00% . Plus it gives you 1% back on the amount you transfer.\nSlate’s
  chip-enabled card makes it easy to travel internationally, but there is a 3% foreign
  transaction fee for each purchase you make. This fee can add up, particularly if
  you’re taking a long vacation and charging most purchases onto your card. If this
  is a deal-breaker for you, BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is an alternative
  to Slate that features no foreign transaction fees, no annual fee, 1.5 reward points
  for every dollar spent and a 12-month 0% intro APR.\nAlthough Slate is a great balance
  transfer card, it doesn’t offer any rewards. If you’re interested in a balance transfer
  card that also has strong cash back rewards, take a look at the Discover it â\x80\x93
  Balance Transfer card which has a 18-month 0% intro APR, 5% cash back in categories
  that rotate quarterly, 1% cash back on everything else and no annual fee  (note:
  the card does have a 3% balance transfer fee).\nShould You Apply For the Slate from
  Chase?\nChase Slate is a very strong card and is unique in that it lets you transfer
  your existing balances free of charge and pay no interest for 15 months on balance
  transfers and purchases. We highly recommend Chase Slate, and it is our best-ranked
  balance transfer card. It’s particularly appealing because it’s available to those
  with good (rather than just excellent) credit and features the chip-and-PIN technology
  that’s so important when traveling overseas.There are some potential drawbacks though,
  including no rewards and a foreign transaction fee. If these are concerns for you,
  check out the above-mentioned alternatives. You can also take advantage of our free
  Balance Transfer Calculator to see which card is the best choice for your particular
  situation.\nRight after the holidays most people have racked up a balance on their
  credit cards and are wondering how they are going to pay it off. Chase Slate is
  a strong solution, offering a 15-month 0% APR on both balance transfers and purchases.
  Many cards offer a 0% intro APR, but the best part about Slate is that you won’t
  pay any balance transfer fees to move your balance(s) onto this card. That’s a huge
  win, since these fees are typically 3% of the balance you’re transferring, which
  can add up to big money. For example, if you’re transferring $5,000 you’d probably
  pay $150 in fees with other cards. With Slate you pay absolutely nothing to transfer
  your money, and you have 15 interest-free months to make payments against the balance,
  which means you can pay it down completely or at least get a head start on reducing
  it. Just make sure you transfer your balance in the first 60 days to take advantage
  of the $0 balance transfer fee, as after that time there will be a fee.\nIn addition
  to the 0% intro APR on balance transfers, you’ll also pay no interest for 15 months
  on purchases. This is a great way to make any big (or small) purchases you need
  and save money on interest fees for over a year. Plus, Slate has no annual fee and
  a fairly low ongoing APR after the 0% intro APR period which is important if you
  plan to carry a balance after the 15 months are up.\nAnother huge point in Slate’s
  favor is that it’s available to those with good credit. A good credit score is typically
  considered to be above 660. Usually credit cards with the best offers are only available
  to people with excellent credit histories, but Slate has all the great features
  offered to excellent credit consumers and is open to those with merely good credit.
  So if you’ve missed a payment or two, or had some other minor hits on your credit
  report you will likely still qualify for this card. Of course, Slate also considers
  other factors like your annual salary and wages, your other annual income and a
  review of your debt, but in general those with good credit have a good shot.\nWorld
  travelers will appreciate that Slate now offers Chip and PIN technology. Chip-enabled
  cards are usually required when traveling outside the U.S., and if your card doesn’t
  have one you might not be able to use it when traveling internationally.\nThings
  To Consider\nChase Slate is a smart way to gradually pay down your balance over
  the course of the 15-month 0% intro APR period, and after the no-interest period
  is up it continues to offer reasonable ongoing APRs. However, if you think you might
  be carrying your balance for a prolonged time, Barclay Ring Mastercard might be
  a better solution for you. It doesn’t have a 0% intro APR period, but features no
  balance transfer fee, no annual fee and a one of the lowest ongoing APRs we’ve ever
  seen â\x80\x93 8.00% . Plus it gives you 1% back on the amount you transfer.\nSlate’s
  chip-enabled card makes it easy to travel internationally, but there is a 3% foreign
  transaction fee for each purchase you make. This fee can add up, particularly if
  you’re taking a long vacation and charging most purchases onto your card. If this
  is a deal-breaker for you, BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is an alternative
  to Slate that features no foreign transaction fees, no annual fee, 1.5 reward points
  for every dollar spent and a 12-month 0% intro APR.\nAlthough Slate is a great balance
  transfer card, it doesn’t offer any rewards. If you’re interested in a balance transfer
  card that also has strong cash back rewards, take a look at the Discover it â\x80\x93
  Balance Transfer card which has a 18-month 0% intro APR, 5% cash back in categories
  that rotate quarterly, 1% cash back on everything else and no annual fee  (note:
  the card does have a 3% balance transfer fee).\nShould You Apply For the Slate from
  Chase?\nChase Slate is a very strong card and is unique in that it lets you transfer
  your existing balances free of charge and pay no interest for 15 months on balance
  transfers and purchases. We highly recommend Chase Slate, and it is our best-ranked
  balance transfer card. It’s particularly appealing because it’s available to those
  with good (rather than just excellent) credit and features the chip-and-PIN technology
  that’s so important when traveling overseas.There are some potential drawbacks though,
  including no rewards and a foreign transaction fee. If these are concerns for you,

  after the holidays most people have racked up a balance on their credit cards and
  are wondering how they are going to pay it off. Chase Slate is a strong solution,
  offering a 15-month 0% APR on both balance transfers and purchases. Many cards offer
  a 0% intro APR, but the best part about Slate is that you won’t pay any balance
  transfer fees to move your balance(s) onto this card. That’s a huge win, since these
  fees are typically 3% of the balance you’re transferring, which can add up to big
  money. For example, if you’re transferring $5,000 you’d probably pay $150 in fees
  with other cards. With Slate you pay absolutely nothing to transfer your money,
  and you have 15 interest-free months to make payments against the balance, which
  means you can pay it down completely or at least get a head start on reducing it.
  Just make sure you transfer your balance in the first 60 days to take advantage
  of the $0 balance transfer fee, as after that time there will be a fee.\nIn addition
  to the 0% intro APR on balance transfers, you’ll also pay no interest for 15 months
  on purchases. This is a great way to make any big (or small) purchases you need
  and save money on interest fees for over a year. Plus, Slate has no annual fee and
  a fairly low ongoing APR after the 0% intro APR period which is important if you
  plan to carry a balance after the 15 months are up.\nAnother huge point in Slate’s
  favor is that it’s available to those with good credit. A good credit score is typically
  considered to be above 660. Usually credit cards with the best offers are only available
  to people with excellent credit histories, but Slate has all the great features
  offered to excellent credit consumers and is open to those with merely good credit.
  So if you’ve missed a payment or two, or had some other minor hits on your credit
  report you will likely still qualify for this card. Of course, Slate also considers
  other factors like your annual salary and wages, your other annual income and a
  review of your debt, but in general those with good credit have a good shot.\nWorld
  travelers will appreciate that Slate now offers Chip and PIN technology. Chip-enabled
  cards are usually required when traveling outside the U.S., and if your card doesn’t
  have one you might not be able to use it when traveling internationally.\nThings
  To Consider\nChase Slate is a smart way to gradually pay down your balance over
  the course of the 15-month 0% intro APR period, and after the no-interest period
  is up it continues to offer reasonable ongoing APRs. However, if you think you might
  be carrying your balance for a prolonged time, Barclay Ring Mastercard might be
  a better solution for you. It doesn’t have a 0% intro APR period, but features no
  balance transfer fee, no annual fee and a one of the lowest ongoing APRs we’ve ever
  seen â\x80\x93 8.00% . Plus it gives you 1% back on the amount you transfer.\nSlate’s
  chip-enabled card makes it easy to travel internationally, but there is a 3% foreign
  transaction fee for each purchase you make. This fee can add up, particularly if
  you’re taking a long vacation and charging most purchases onto your card. If this

  to people with excellent credit histories, but Slate has all the great features
  offered to excellent credit consumers and is open to those with merely good credit.
  So if you’ve missed a payment or two, or had some other minor hits on your credit
  report you will likely still qualify for this card. Of course, Slate also considers
  other factors like your annual salary and wages, your other annual income and a
  review of your debt, but in general those with good credit have a good shot.\nWorld
  travelers will appreciate that Slate now offers Chip and PIN technology. Chip-enabled
  cards are usually required when traveling outside the U.S., and if your card doesn’t
  have one you might not be able to use it when traveling internationally.\nThings
  To Consider\nChase Slate is a smart way to gradually pay down your balance over
  the course of the 15-month 0% intro APR period, and after the no-interest period
  is up it continues to offer reasonable ongoing APRs. However, if you think you might
  be carrying your balance for a prolonged time, Barclay Ring Mastercard might be
  a better solution for you. It doesn’t have a 0% intro APR period, but features no
  balance transfer fee, no annual fee and a one of the lowest ongoing APRs we’ve ever
  seen â\x80\x93 8.00% . Plus it gives you 1% back on the amount you transfer.\nSlate’s
  chip-enabled card makes it easy to travel internationally, but there is a 3% foreign
  transaction fee for each purchase you make. This fee can add up, particularly if
  you’re taking a long vacation and charging most purchases onto your card. If this
  is a deal-breaker for you, BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is an alternative
  to Slate that features no foreign transaction fees, no annual fee, 1.5 reward points
  for every dollar spent and a 12-month 0% intro APR.\nAlthough Slate is a great balance
  transfer card, it doesn’t offer any rewards. If you’re interested in a balance transfer
  card that also has strong cash back rewards, take a look at the Discover it â\x80\x93
  Balance Transfer card which has a 18-month 0% intro APR, 5% cash back in categories
  that rotate quarterly, 1% cash back on everything else and no annual fee  (note:
  the card does have a 3% balance transfer fee).\nShould You Apply For the Slate from
  Chase?\nChase Slate is a very strong card and is unique in that it lets you transfer
  your existing balances free of charge and pay no interest for 15 months on balance
  transfers and purchases. We highly recommend Chase Slate, and it is our best-ranked
  balance transfer card. It’s particularly appealing because it’s available to those
  with good (rather than just excellent) credit and features the chip-and-PIN technology
  that’s so important when traveling overseas.There are some potential drawbacks though,
  including no rewards and a foreign transaction fee. If these are concerns for you,
  check out the above-mentioned alternatives. You can also take advantage of our free
  Balance Transfer Calculator to see which card is the best choice for your particular
  situation.\nRight after the holidays most people have racked up a balance on their
  credit cards and are wondering how they are going to pay it off. Chase Slate is
  a strong solution, offering a 15-month 0% APR on both balance transfers and purchases.
  Many cards offer a 0% intro APR, but the best part about Slate is that you won’t
  pay any balance transfer fees to move your balance(s) onto this card. That’s a huge
  win, since these fees are typically 3% of the balance you’re transferring, which
  can add up to big money. For example, if you’re transferring $5,000 you’d probably
  pay $150 in fees with other cards. With Slate you pay absolutely nothing to transfer
  your money, and you have 15 interest-free months to make payments against the balance,
  which means you can pay it down completely or at least get a head start on reducing
  it. Just make sure you transfer your balance in the first 60 days to take advantage
  of the $0 balance transfer fee, as after that time there will be a fee.\nIn addition
  to the 0% intro APR on balance transfers, you’ll also pay no interest for 15 months
  on purchases. This is a great way to make any big (or small) purchases you need
  and save money on interest fees for over a year. Plus, Slate has no annual fee and
  a fairly low ongoing APR after the 0% intro APR period which is important if you
  plan to carry a balance after the 15 months are up.\nAnother huge point in Slate’s
  favor is that it’s available to those with good credit. A good credit score is typically
  considered to be above 660. Usually credit cards with the best offers are only available
  to people with excellent credit histories, but Slate has all the great features

  and 24% w/ zero interest for 12 months with 3% transfer fee. Of course I will keep

  are a lot of balance transfer credit cards out there, designed specifically for
  anyone who is carrying a balance on their credit card and paying high (or any) interest
  fees each month. In fact, there are so many it can be challenging to determine how
  one is better or worse than the others. Chase Slate is one of the cards vying for
  your business, and we took an in-depth look at this card to answer the question
  “is it any good?” The short answer is yes, it’s a great choice that can save you
  hundreds or thousands of dollars if you’re currently paying interest on another
  credit card.Â  It’s the only card we’ve found with the combination of a lengthy
  0% intro APR and no balance transfer fee. The in-depth answer, as well as the card’s
  pros and cons, is explained below.Right after the holidays most people have racked
  up a balance on their credit cards and are wondering how they are going to pay it
  off. Chase Slate is a strong solution, offering a 15-month 0% intro APR on both
  balance transfers and purchases. Many cards offer a 0% intro APR, but the best part
  about Slate is that you won’t pay any balance transfer fees to move your balance(s)
  onto this card. That’s a huge win, since these fees are typically 3% of the balance
  you’re transferring, which can add up to big money. For example, if you’re transferringÂ $10,000
  you’d probably pay $300 in fees with other cards. With SlateÂ you pay absolutely
  nothing to transfer your money, and you have 15Â interest-free months to make payments
  against the balance, which canÂ give you even bigger savings. For example, if you
  were making $700Â monthly payments on that $10,000 balance and had a 20% interest
  rate,Â it would take you 17 months to pay it off and you’d pay over $1,500 inÂ interest.
  If you transferred that balance to Slate, you’d pay it offÂ in 15 months with no
  interest, saving $1,500 and paying absolutely noÂ fees.Â Just make sure you transfer
  your balance in the first 60 days to take advantage of the $0 balance transfer fee,
  as after that time there will be a fee.In addition to the 0% intro APR on balance
  transfers, you’ll also pay no interest for 15 months on purchases. This is a great
  way to make any big (or small) purchases you need and save money on interest fees
  for over a year. Plus, Slate has no annual fee and a fairly low ongoing APR after
  the 0% intro APR period which is important if you plan to carry a balance after
  the 15 months are up.If you’ve been known to make a late payment or two you’ll appreciate
  that Slate has no penalty APR. This means your interest rate won’t increase if your
  payment is delayed. We don’t recommend habitually paying your bill late, but it’s
  nice to know if it does happens you won’t be penalized for it.Another huge point
  in Slate’s favor is that it’s available to those with good credit. A good credit
  score is typically considered to be above 660.Â Usually credit cards with the best
  offers are only available to people with excellent credit histories, but Slate has
  all the great features offered to excellent credit consumers and is open to those
  with merely good credit. So if you’ve missed a payment or two, or had some other
  minor hits on your credit report you will likely still qualify for this card. Of
  course, Slate also considers other factors like your annual salary and wages, your
  other annual income and a review of your debt, but in general those with good credit
  have a good shot.World travelers will appreciate that Slate nowÂ offers Chip and
  PIN technology. Chip-enabled cards are usually required when traveling outside the
  U.S., and if your card doesn’t have one you might not be able to use it when traveling
  internationally.Chase Slate is a smart way to gradually pay down your balance over
  the course of the 15-month 0% intro APR period, and after the no-interest period
  is up it continues to offer reasonable ongoing APRs. However, if you think you might
  be carrying your balance for a prolonged time, Barclaycard Ring Mastercard might
  be a better solution for you. It doesn’t have a 0% intro APR period, but features
  no balance transfer fee, no annual fee and a one of the lowest ongoing APRs we’ve
  ever seen – 8.00% .If a 15-month 0% intro APR isn’t quite enough, but you think
  you can pay down your balance in under 2 years, consider Citi Simplicity. ItÂ has
  an incredibly lengthy 21-month intro APR on balance transfers and purchases, which
  would give you an extra 6 months of 0% APR breathing room. There is a 3% balance
  transfer fee, but those 6 extra months might make it worthwhile.Slate’s chip-enabled
  card makes it easy to travel internationally, but there is a 3% foreign transaction
  fee for each purchase you make. This fee can add up, particularly if you’re taking
  a long vacation and charging most purchases onto your card. If this is a deal-breaker
  for you, BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit CardÂ is an alternative to Slate that
  features no foreign transaction fees, a 20,000 point intro bonus (worth $200 when
  you redeem towards travel), no annual fee, 1.5 reward points for every dollar spent
  and a 12-month 0% intro APR.Although Slate is a great balance transfer card, it
  doesn’t offer any rewards. If you’re interested in a balance transfer card that
  also has strong cash back rewards, take a look at the Discover it – Balance Transfer
  card which has a 18-month 0% intro APR on balance transfers, 5% cash back in categories
  that rotate quarterly (now through Dec 31st they are Amazon.com, department stores
  and clothing stores), 1% cash back on everything else and no annual fee (note: the
  card does have a 3% balance transfer fee). And as a very generous added bonus, you’ll
  get double cash back your first year! That means if you earn $300 in year one, Discover
  will give you another $300 for a total earnings of $600, which is pretty spectacular.
  Or if your credit history has a ding or two on it, consider Chase Freedom. Chase
  Freedom is available to those with just good credit (typically considered to be
  a credit score above 660), and itÂ features a 15-month 0% intro APR and up to 5%
  cash back in quarterly categories. Just in time for the holiday season those 5%
  categories are Amazon.com, Zappos.com, Audible.com and Diapers.com until December
  31st. And Chase Freedom just raised its intro bonus to a whopping $150 after you
  spend just $500 in the first three months, effectively over 30% cash back on your
  first $500 spent.Chase Slate is a very strong card and is unique in that it lets
  you transfer your existing balances free of charge and pay no interest for 15 months
  on balance transfers and purchases. We highly recommend Chase Slate, and it is our
  best-ranked balance transfer card. It’s particularly appealing because it’s available
  to those with good (rather than just excellent) credit and features the chip-and-PIN
  technology that’s so important when traveling overseas.There are some potential
  drawbacks though, including no rewards and a foreign transaction fee. If these are
  concerns for you, check out the above-mentioned alternatives. You can also take
  advantage of our free Balance Transfer Calculator to see which card is the best
  choice for your particular situation.Disclaimer: This content is not provided or

  tuition payments on zero interest for 15 month credit cards … then transferred all
  to chase slate for fifteen months zero interest and no transfer fees… zero interest
  ends May 16 on slate.\nGot about two years interest free keeping up with monthly
  payments of about 1%  of balance. Saved a  few dollars and now she is working.A
  good discussion of the positive features of the Chase card, but not the negative.
  I really should not call them negative, just features that make it less useful.\nI
  have a “good” credit score, but have several credit cards and carry a total balance
  of $50,000. (Don’t comment with your neither a borrow nor a lender be messages,
  this balance came about because of businesses I owned failing.)\nI pay a very high
  rate of interest on that $50,000 – averaging around 25% a year.  A credit card with
  zero transfer fees and a low APR would be wonderful. However (and I have looked
  into this) if I apply one of these “great” credit cards I will be lucky to get a
  limit of $3000. While that would help, it is not a game changer. So I am stuck in
  a situation in which my low interest loan (house mortgage) is getting nicely paid
  off, it is hard to make a dent on the high interest ones.The best way to say out
  of debt is not to own a Credit Cord any credit cord… if I don’t have the cash I
  don’t need it…What balances?  I pay off  my cards each month and do not carry any
  balances from month.  If I don’t have the money, I don’t need it!  Viola! no debt
  to carry over that keeps getting higher and higher each month!I got 18 months no
  interest with Chase on $5000.00  ~Thanks Chase~for emergence use eI attemped to
  renew my subscription.   Money was witdrawn from my account but I still do not have
  subscription privaledges.  nittypoptart990I have a question, if your current card
  offers miles and you TRANSFER the unpaid balance to another card do you get the
  miles on the balance the new card then Paid OFF if you are NOT canceling that card?How
  do I  apply for a  C hace  SkateNeed more information on this.  This sounds great.Unless
  you are in 20% or greater, just keep the card you have. Don’t use it ever again.
  \ Pay 2X the minimum or more each month.  Pay it down until you can pay it off totally.
  \ Don’t bother getting a zero interest transfer, you will just be tempted to use
  the old card.  Also pay yourself first.  Open a savings account and put some money
  aside every payday, even if $10 or $20.  Do it every paycheck and don’t touch.  Watch
  it grow.WARNING – This may sound great at first, but your Credit Rating may suffer.
  First, you take a hit for the Inquiry against your Credit. Then your score will
  drop for opening a new account when one card has a high balance. I know. It happened
  to me. No more Balance Transfers for me.the best and only way to pay off a credit
  card is send them a check and cut up the dam cardHow do I apply for Chase Slate?Credit
  Cards are voluntary slavery so I guess if you like being a slave then get one…otherwise
  be smart and save your money and don’t spend what you don’t have…that’s the best
  financial advice youll ever get and TRUTHFUL…I got guns for sale 9mmI got guns for
  sale hit me upCan I transfer a high interest amount from another card to my Chase
  card even though I have another Chase card?Yes this slate transfer balance is only
  for new or non chase customers. i have been with chase many many years fairly good
  fico # and good credit score and they gave me the same line credit ratio blah blah
  blah, well no duh that is why iwant a transfer balance.Irene Nixon,\n you admit
  that you were late in paying TWICE, yet you blame the bank (‘…WTG Chase !!!!…’),
  for charging you late fees which they told you in the application they would.!!!
  \ You didn’t read the application you signed, and you blame the bank for your lack
  of responsibility and being a dumbass!!!!  I bet you vote Democrat.Is best to simply
  not have credit cards.  No one needs them.  I get around fine with my debit card
  and now  I actually have a real safety not fund that has a year’s salary in it,
  if I ever have a true emergency.  People live in debt and it has become acceptable,
  but if you have on major life event, there goes your house, there goes your car,
  there goes your life.  My suggestion, stop using credit cards, start paying off
  the small ones little by little.  Then start putting more money to pay off your
  home faster and pay off your car.  It’s amazing how big your take home pay becomes
  when you don’t have monthly debt payments on credit cards, a car, or even a house.Oh
  yes.  If you have plenty of money, and don’t really have much debt, Chase Slate
  is for you.  They will be happy to let you transfer balance owed on another card.
  \ However, my fiance, who has a credit score of 712, and ALWAYS pays his bills on
  time,  applied.  He wanted to transfer the balance from his Discover card (which
  I think was $15,000).  They refused him because they said he had too much debt (car
  payment, etc.)  What’s the point if all they want is people who hardly owe anything.
  \ Slate sounded so good until we realized that they really don’t want to help those
  who really could use a few months of no interest while they continue to pay off
  a credit card balance!!!!!B.S I have a Chase Slate card with chip . They do not
  let you pay anything before your monthly statement arrives and there late fee is
  $35.00. I was late a couple of times by about 3 days [only because I got the due
  date of 2 credit cards confused:-( WTG Chase !!!!I need to know more?what a wonderful
  worldthis would be a nice they for meno commentI should have read these comments
  first. I am an existing customer. It sounded like it would help with some other
  higher rate balances.  I called Chase. No such offer for existing customers as stated
  in one or more of the helpful comments. I hope you all get and stay out of debt.
  There are better dances to be danced.bullshit remve from sucker listDon’t fool yourself
  with balance transfers. If you can’t pay off your card balance when you get the
  statement don’t spend the money. You will have more money in the long run in your
  pocket instead of owing the money. Get cards that pay cash back or rewards with
  no yearly fees. Of course you have to build your credit score up to get these cards.
  I learned my lesson 15 years ago and have been raking in the cash rewards ever since.looking
  for a business line of creditThey would not lend me a dime and I have my mortgage
  there.   When I begged for a loan to put on a new roof at the house, all I got was
  $500.   My roof was $4,700.  Bad deal on this card unless you only want $500.  That
  is all they ever lend you.  Bank of America is worse.Seb….That credit score is a
  ruff one but there are websites out there for credit cards for all types of credit
  and just try to find a zero interest card that you qualify for and don’t use it
  for any purchases. Even if it has a high interest and maybe only 12 month transfer.
  At least for  12 months you will be paying principle, just don’t miss any payments
  and your credit will improve. In time your score will improve and you can qualify
  for better cards with better benefits. If you buy a car and make payments on time
  yous credit score will sky rocket.You’re in debt because of Democrats? How funny.
  I’m in less Debt now then i was under Bush. Anyways A zero balance transfer card
  like the chase card being pitched on this article is a great way to pay down debt.
  Even if you can not get the balance fully paid off in the term agreement what i
  have done is roll over the remaining balance to another zero balance credit card.
  I currently use a American Express for my zero interest for 18 months. I will have
  the balance paid off with 200 dollar payments each month by the time the term expires.
  The zero transfer fee is VERY huge on this card and when I decide to get another
  one of these types of cards i will apply.You are in debt because of the Democrats
  (last 4 letters spell RATS) Remember that the next time you vote.just checked, they
  still have it. 24 months 0 apr (although they do charge a balance transfer fee)if
  you are near a Santander Bank your best bet is to go with theirs. i opened one with
  balance transfer for 24 months(don’t know if they still have this offer) and if
  you set up your automatic deposit and pay 2 bills from the account every month they
  deposit 20 dollars into your savings account. can’t beat thatThere are so many mixed
  reviews here… some say fraud some say wonderful! How do I really find out the truth?
  My cards total only $1,100 so this looks like a great idea. But, is it?TexRancher
  is right.  Those social conservative republicans in congress want to destroy this
  country by giving it to the wealthy elite like the Kochs, Adelson and anyone else
  with billion$.  They only care about the rest of us a few months before election
  time.  VOTE Democratic or Independent.Same happen to me, just because I had a late
  payment ONE !!! they made it sound like it was the deadliest sin in the world.  They
  screw my credit score of 700+ with their investigation and at the end they offer
  me much, much less than what I needed it.  I told them thank you but no thank you
  I don’t need another credit card .  RIP OFFWhat if my credit score is 610-630? What
  is a good solution for avoiding interest? I cannot get approved for Chase Slate.I
  was left  by my boyfreind of 25 years, when he left, so did my income, not married.\nI
  need help with my  bills. My credit score went to the basement. I need to have help,\nI
  see no way out but death. no job, no income other what  SSI , not even enough to
  live on to get me through the month.\nCan or won’t someone please help me, please??Ya,
  I was denied as well.  Now, my credit score is lower because of their inquiry.it
  is great to transfer your balance to a new card with zero interest ONLY if you promise
  yourself not to use the new card for any new purchases at all. Why?  Because the
  old debt you transfer to your new card will be used first to pay off while the new
  purchases you made will be last to pay off . What it means is that you will be stuck
  with your new balance accumulating interest charges without ability to pay it down
  at all until you pay off your old debt first.. it is a ZERO SUCKER TRAP! I was lucky
  to catch the dirty trick before accumulating too much new debt so I paid it off
  earlier than I liked to.. Never again!  But you can still transfer your old balance
  to your new zero interest card but REMEMBER NEVER TO USE THE CARD TO MAKE ANY NEW
  PURCHASES AT ALL!!  Use the new card to pay off your old debt at zero interest..
  Don’t dally or goof around with it as zero interest will expire in 18 months or
  whatever it says ..   Use the time to pay off that  old debt … never use it to make
  new purchases !~! Pass this along to your friends  !I got two of these cards and
  transferred balances and no trouble whatsoever.  0% interest for 15 months and on
  was for 18 months I think.  No problems and I transferred 2500 on each card.  It
  will be paid off within the time period and I saved a lot of interest.  I suggest
  trying it.Stupid, uneducated people fail Or refuse , to recognize what muslims represent
  in this world…..That includes those socialists in Congress!TexRancher, DOD school
  in Ankara, Turkey 1957-1959!Don’t believe a word of this offer — it is a SCAM!True.
  \  Be prepared to have a it on your credit  score and then they turn you down because
  your credit balances are too high.Very interested in thisThis was a total waste
  of time!!!!  I was approved for a miniscule amount which did NOTHNG for me.  So,
  then the account had to be closed which does not look good on a credit report.  Wish
  I had never done it – if you want more than $1000.00 don’t waste your time…..just
  wish they would have told me this up front and saved us both time.If you haven’t
  got one of these cards, you’ll have to be approved for a credit limit. If accepted,
  you can’t transfer an amount that’s more than 80% of that limit. When you request
  a balance transfer at the same time that you apply, you just have to sit back and
  wait for the verdict. If you’re asking to transfer $10,000 but they only approve
  you for a $10,000 limit, they’ll only transfer $8,000, leaving you to juggle the
  remainder. They base your limit on more than your credit score — household income
  is a big factor. And as noted, you can’t transfer balances from one card to another
  card with the same company. You might have to play a shell game, transferring a
  balance to a card with a different company then back, but if you try that, you might
  suddenly find that you’re ineligible for any balance transfer.Sounds easy and reasonable.It
  all sounds good, but if you don’t have a high credit score, you’re out of luck here.What
  will the interest be after 15 months?Sorry Janny Brown, I never said not to spend
  money, but these credit companies are designed to MAKE MONEY from YOUR MONEY. And
  yes you do need credit to a degree,  Just be careful of their traps as that are
  designed to put you more into debt, How many companies do you know that get people
  out of debt?  Yes, life has some unexpected surprises, that’s why you must plan
  for them.  My debt was a medical emergency, but I paid that down like it was on
  fire, They would have eaten me alive on the interest collected.  Use them, don’t
  let them use you.  I hope your situation improves soon.  Been there, done that and

  \  at  0%   APR   ,  as   announced   by   some   Credit   Card   Companies   is

  easy to say Donâ\x80\x99t spend money, No credit card, no debt. While other people
  may be in different situation, such as kids in college, parents ill, own business
  less than 5 years, etc. That is how my credit card debt come from. I pay thousands
  dollars each month for high interests charges.  I have to search balance transfer
  offers all the time to save money. I tried Chase, but I canceled the same day I
  received the card. It was surprise to me they gave me such little availability,
  regardless how much I can make. I donâ\x80\x99t need to transfer my pocket exchanges
  to this credit card.Don’t even THINK of applying for Slate from Chase. My FICO is
  a respectable 750+ and I was approved for a puny amount. I don’t want another Credit
  Card, I want to transfer balances. It’s a bait and switch operation!No credit card,
  no debt.  I own everything I have.  It forces me to save for a rainy day, and I
  sleep better than those with three credit cards.  But if you need a credit card,
  stay away from Synchony.  I made more than the regular payment and paid them off,
  during that time they lowered my credit limit (no problem), and when I paid them
  off, they closed my account (Can’t use them for reference, but they can’t erase
  my payment history).  They were not happy because they were not able to collect
  their 27% + interest.  These cards are known as “Poverty Traps”.   Instead of helping,
  it adds more burden and more debt.  Make a plan (Budget) and stick to it.  Don’t
  buy things you don’t need, you can still enjoy life. Things don’t make you happy,
  it may make things easier……but not happy.  Get your priorities straight  and you
  will be happy.People should be told a couple of things about Chase Slate – they
  do not accept complete balance transfers.  There is a limit.  So, if you are looking
  to transfer a large amount and try to get it down quickly – you will be disappointed.
  \ Then, all you will get out of it is an additional credit card – which is not good.
  \ f you have another Chase Card that has a high interest – like we do – you can’t
  transfer or request to receive this card to get that amount down either.  Basically,
  this is not to help you get out of debt, but to trap you into owing them.How do
  I apply to Chase Slate?I have two credit cards, my credit score, (myfico.com) is
  793. If I get another card, my score will drop 55 points, according to Fico.(KITING)
  TO THE NTH DEGREEI don’t have any credit cards at all, or any finance payments.
  \ Life is good when it’s simple and you make what you want instead of buying it.Another
  card to consider for balance transfer options is the LLBean Visa Card.  The rewards
  are great if you are a huge fan of their products.  However, for around the past
  year or so, they have been offering balance transfer options of 0% APR for 15 months
  and only a 1% balance transfer fee.  The fee goes to 3% if you choose the 0% APR
  for 18 months.  $50 for a %5000 balance transfer basically pays itself after the
  first month.Don’t spend money you don’t have in the first place. Then there is nothing
  to worry about, to check, to consider, yadda yadda yadda.If you want to take advantage
  of making a transfer for 0% interest whether there is a transfer fee or not from
  any Credit Card company.  Consider to pay off at an extended time 15 months for
  CHASE or 21 months for CITI Simplicity.  A very high interest will apply thereafter.
  \  In the meantime, you should consider pay off new purchases on the bill.  Pay
  maximum to the one with highest interest. Pay minimum to the lowest one.  Think
  twice your shopping cart “Only buy the one you need, do not buy the one you want”.
  \ Do this way you would get out of your debt soon.Have a high credit score of 780
  & was only approved for $800.00 ??????????\nWe declined the card that Chase offered.

  But balance transfers are slooooow, and the 60-day no-fee window closes fast. Thereafter
  it’s 3%, $5 minimum fee, so you would want to transfer a minimum of $167 to get
  the max efficiency from the fee. Chase Freedom has been doing 5% cash back on gas.
  \ Speedway, formerly Hess, offers 10 cents a gallon off  when you use their Speedy
  Rewards card before you purchase.  Speedway is same price, cash or credit. In addition,
  Freedom offers another 3% cash back if you redeem your Freedom points for Lowe’s

  Quicksilver is a much faster balance transfer card. They have an annual fee, I think
  $39 0r $49, but no transfer fee thru March 2016. I pay $200 to the Quik card, and
  then do 4 separate $50 balance transfers to my other cards.  Balance transfers count
  as a payment, so on my credit report, my $200 becomes $400 in on-time payments.BE
  SURE YOU CHECK THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ZERO-INTEREST OFFERS!\nMANY REQUIRE THAT
  THE BALANCE IS PAID OFF AT THE END OF THE PROMOTIONAL PERIOD, OR THEY WILL CHARGE
  YOU FULL INTEREST FROM DAY ONE!!Just close the cards  at your request so your credit
  doesn’t get affected. Pay extra to the ones with higher interests, pay the minimum
  on the others. Do this for every card, you be free in about two years, depending
  on how high your debt is. Never, and I mean NEVER get into one of those programs
  that promise to help you. They will just screw you more, like freedom debt. They
  don’t work with your creditors, they just have you send them money and after they
  got a lot, then they intend to negotiate, mean while, your cards are not getting
  paid, and your credit score drops below 600. I know, I did it……..I have extra wood?Don
  Johnson, your credit score does NOT go down every time a creditor checks your credit
  report, only if it is done at YOUR request, such as when you apply for credit.  Many
  companies that have extended you credit will check your report EVERY month, but
  that does not affect your score at all.This is my third attempt to make a negative
  comment!!  DON’T DO CHASE!!  SCAM FOR $1000 LIMIT CARD.   NO BALANCE TRANSFERS!!!can
  a Wall Mart Card be transferred to another card?This card will only give you $1000
  to start with if you have average salary so you will not be able to transfer large
  balances as they promise. Opening any new credit card will hurt your credit score.
  \ So, only open this if you can get by with very small transfer or make a lot of
  money.I saw this article before (at least something similar to it).   I applied
  because not only are my cards maxed, but I have two that are over 29% and are going
  nowhere fast.  Plus I have 2 cards that charged a late fee 0 which made it an over
  limit fee and I have been playing THAT circle game for almost a year.  How did I
  get like this??  I am on SSI disability and on Medicare and last year had breast
  cancer surgery. after 2 lumpectomies, I ended up having a double mastectomy and
  phase one reconstruction.  Bills kept coming in and charged everything so that I
  could get the medical refund on the taxes.  I was going to used the 0% card to pay
  off and destroy my 2 29% cards and get back under my max on the “circle” cards.

  that are offering a promotional balance transfer with 0%apr. My apprehension is
  in opening a new card just for this purpose, I read once (maybe suze orman) that
  every time you apply for a new credit card (even in stores on the spot) they check
  your credit score and that every time your score is checked it goes down tick. Does

  \ They hold things against you from over 10 years ago too.Exactly because they offered
  15-months @ 0% and $0 fee for balance transfers, I applied for a Chase Slate card
  and was approved for $7500 (my credit score was 820 at the time). Just as promoted,
  I successfully transferred $7350 from another card, no fee was charged, and no interest
  has accrued. It’s now been 3 months and I’m 100% satisfied.Good concept….but i guess

  (generally which I didn’t use much and always paid them off). I had many offers
  of transfer balance, so I parlayed those offers into financing my construction.
  I created a spreadsheet to remind me when I needed to pay them  off. I would often
  pay one off w/ another and then sometimes back again. Ultimately, I paid them all
  off with my equity I gained from a house I sold and ultimately the rest when I sold
  the house I was living in and everything. I played their game to the hilt … and
  did OK … BUT … you have to manage those balance transfers very carefully. 0% and
  no balance transfer is key.Best way to get rid of credit card debit is not to have

  @Cathy,The Chase Slate card we detail on this page has NO balance transfer fee if
  you transfer your balance in the first 60 days. It’s possible you transferred your
  balance after this 60 day period. However, the Chase Slate we discuss in this blog
  post and link to has absolutely no balance transfer fees (prior to the 60 day cut
  off).Hi @Cathy, The Chase Slate card we detail on this page has NO balance transfer

  disabled and now we/I  have enormace credit card debt.  Because of “LIFE” happening
  and having to pay bills I’m in debt.  I’ve never missed a payment, or had any other
  problems but now that I really need assistance no one is willing to give a person
  a chance.   I can’t believe that if you have always had excellent credit scores
  until “Life” happened it doesn’t make a difference.  Excellent past history doesn’t
  mean a thing, one one will  give me a chance to get my life back together again.
  \   It’s sad that the USA will literally take a persons home if illness or death
  cause unforeseen expenses.   I probably shouldn’t say this but… Of course, if I
  came from another country I would get the medical for free.  Then I wouldn’t been
  in such a sad place.  To all the others in this situation, let’s pray for each other.

  Once you used it for over thousand dollars, you won’t escape from it. They wait
  till you make one late payment to increase the interest rate to 29% or 31%. There
  was a time I had 31% for my card balance.What kind of business was that? Recenly
  I called them and requested a lower interest rate since my credit score is now very
  close to 700. My request was denied. I think my chase card interest rate right now
  is 26% now.  I transfered the balance to Citi card which I have 21 months 0% interest
  and thereafter 15%. No late fee and no panelty APR (29%-31% like chase gave me).
  Just one time 3% for balance transfer which was something very little compare to

  history , the sad thing is that most people in this country that need to transfer
  balances don’t have a very stellar or even good credit (most of the time below 700)
  that will not be approved for this card .  the things to consider if u are not fortunate
  to get this card  that there are other  options for u . use cards that u already
  have ( so u don’t get a hit on ur credit to open a new one ) that already offer
  promos on the existing card , even if u pay a 3% fee to bring a bal ance that u
  have at 15.00% it still going  going to save u 12% annually , and if the rate is
  for more then 1 year the better savings you will have . If the card you use for
  the transfers is an existing account and doesn’t have the 0% on purchases don’t
  use the card for purchases keep it separate . with the new credit card act passed
  in 2010 by President Obama a default Apr can only be applied to new purchases not
  the existing bal on the act , also with all credit cards due to new laws banks can
  no longer take away your 0% if u are late with ur payment ( it’s not  a special
  feature of the slate cards its the law to all cards ). so has a consumer study your
  options , figure out if the cards u already have offer promos , fees, find out what
  is ur annual % rate u are paying … do the math , if the  0% is for a year or more
  and u are paying more then what the  transaction fee is … don’t be afraid  it’s
  only money after all….Chase Slate is definately a good card for most people with

  to take advantage of this offer and here’s what they don’t tell you.  The only way
  you are going to get approved for balance transfer is if you have an available credit
  line that matches the total amount of the debt you are trying to transfer.  in other
  words, if you think they will approve the transfer with your current debt to income
  ratio, it’s not going to happen.  What they will do is simply approve and send you
  yet another credit card with an available balance only as large as your remaining
  available credit at an astronomical percentage rate.  I did not need another card
  and the way they process this is like doubling down on your debt.  I had to make
  several calls to cancel the credit card I did not ask for.Don’t fall for this marketing

  like 100% of your debt is with Chase) — so you need to apply to a non-Chase credit
  card (like maybe one of the other cards listed in this article or wherever – just
  not Chase) – and 2nd, you should be applying multiple times for a credit card because
  each time you apply the bank will do a hard credit pull which tanks your credit

  credit cards — wait 6 mos to 9 mos before you apply for ANY  credit card (or ANY
  debt always wait 6-9 mos between applications) — then apply for a non-Chase credit
  card.   However in general the credit card companies have become extremely tight
  about issuing anyone a new credit card.    I would try to go to a  Credit Union
  to get rid of that 27% credit card by rolling it over to one of their cards which
  are almost always a much lower rate like 10 – 16% which makes a huge difference.

  MR WILLIAM FREY – I am just another consumer with a small business (DBA) like you,

  are delusional; there’s absolutely no value in having a high score.  So what, you
  have a high FICO score?  That just means you’re good at giving money to banks and
  lenders.  I seriously doubt if any legitimate millionaires even have a FICO score;
  years ago they learned to live within their means, paid cash, and invested (starting
  with small amounts) wisely.  It certainly isn’t rocket science.Nobody ever became
  rich by how they used their credit cards.  They became wealthy by NOT using credit
  cards.  If you’re not spending less than you’re earning today, what do you plan
  to live on when you retire?  Please don’t say that you’re going to rely entirely
  upon Social Security benefits; if it still exists in 20 years, it sure won’t provide
  enough for you to live on with dignity.Read Thomas Stanley’s book, “The Millionaire

  because it has changed names at least three times since I had it.  I also have a
  Juniper Master Card which I have also had for a long time.  A few months ago when
  I was paying my bills I was disturbed at the amount of interest these cards are
  charging.  The Chase card has a little under $2,000.00 on it.  The Juniper card
  has a little over $3,000.00 on it.  I called both credit card companies to ask about
  lowering my interest rate since I have been a long time customer and I always pay
  my bill on time.  Juniper took a few seconds and looked at my account and lowered
  it on the phone by 5% and also took away my interest charges for that months bill!!
  \ A few days later I got a letter from them that explained that after reviewing
  my account they lowered it another 2%!!  When I called Slate, where I have the lower
  amount due, they told me they could not do anything for me.  I even told them I
  would close the account and put the credit on a different credit card with a lower
  interest rate.  They still chose to do nothing.  Currently, the interest on the
  Slate card is 25.24%.  The interest on the Juniper card is 14.99% and if I were

  it easier to pay.  Hence we cut ourselves off near the billing date.  (Sometimes

  to my previous comment: The best ones are also those credit cards that besides the
  0% on purchases for a long period of time the even give you cash back, imagine making
  purchases that will have to make no matter what paying cash. Get a card (if you
  qualify of course) and use the card, you get money back to use as you please.To

  it really helps to get an offer for a credit card with the 0% for a long time and
  even better if there is no balance transfer fee. but in order to make  use of that
  offer you must make sure to by the time the offer ends you will be able to pay off
  whatever money you took from it. I is not like borrowing money and never pay back.
  If you are about financing be careful.\nI have use this kinds of credit card offers
  for more than 15 years with very good results, even if I have to pay a 3% transaction
  fee, (which most of the time I do not) is worth it, you can use that money to buy
  a car,  remodel your home  or invest it to avoid interest on a loan . I have used
  as much as 4 credit card offers at the same time  for the down payment on a house,
  fix the house and then put it for rent then I start saving the money to pay it back
  some of the cards ( I also work on the side) when you pay the card back you will
  usually get another offer to use the money again or   if I get another new card
  offer I just transfer the  balances I have to the new one for another 12 or 18 months.\nAs
  I said, do not think that is like money you borrow from your parents or brother
  and will be forget about it, do not borrow from anyone if you do not make a plan

  those like Ed & DL, who advocate destroying credit cards and use only cash, do not
  know exactly how and what do credit cards work for us. First of all, we can only
  cut up our cards if our cards are all paid up, i.e. there’s no balance at all to
  pay, in which case, we shouldn’t even be in this conversation at all. Second, for
  those with only enough funds to pay for our monthly expenses and not enough to pay
  down debt, then it’s essential that we pay down our debt first and cut back on our
  expenses, for as long as it takes to pay off our balances. Once that’s done, then
  we must always ensure that we settle our credit card balances in full every month
  (which is what I told my grown-up kids that they must do), to build up our credit
  score and obtain the lowest rates and best terms whenever we need to purchase anything
  through financing. America is the only country in the world where we can purchase
  a house and/or a car without having cash to pay for them, provided our credit score
  is high and our credit history is great, which I recently did for my son and my
  daughter, who bought a house and a car each (not at the same time but spread over
  6-months interval for each purchase) without any cash (which they couldn’t believe)
  but using the purchase checks from the banks’ credit cards. I’ve got 3 cards with
  more than $20K each and they keep sending me these purchase checks, which I used
  to provide funds for my son’s closing costs (although I had to pay 2% fee and 3%
  fee for two of them and the third was free but all 0% APR for 16months). I told
  them to buy the houses for less than $150K (if they’re going to live in them for
  at least 5yrs), instead of paying rising rent on their apts, and build up their
  equity, so that they can purchase another house in future. The bottomline is that,
  whatever funds we have every month should be used to pay down our balances and then,
  charge everything we spend to our credit cards, BUT ensuring that we spend less
  every month than what we pay, i.e. our total balances must be reduced every month,
  so that we can save our monthly interests and pay off our balances. There’re two
  things always to take note of, viz. (1) pay more to cards with the highest interest
  and/or lowest balance first; (2) if our credit score is very good, we can apply
  for the 0% cards every six months (with more than 12 months 0% APR) and transfer
  our highest interest balance to this new card. If the new card doesn’t have enough
  credit limit to do much good, then use 50% to transfer balances and charge the other
  50% for your new expenses (avoid maxing it) and make sure that we pay at least 25%
  of our monthly balances, so that we’ll have enough credit for the following month’s
  expenses and after 3 to 6 months, the bank will increase the credit limit on our
  new card, without asking for any increase, which is usually 20% at least (which
  won’t happen if we use the full limit to transfer balances because banks must earn
  money from our purchases for that to happen). My son’s Slate card increased his
  credit limit from $3K to $6K because I told him not to use more than 20% every month
  and pay the balance in full, which also helped him to pay for the renovation expenses
  for his new house. I hope this helps, but please seek clarification if in doubt.
  God bless.For those like Ed & DL, who advocate destroying credit cards and use only
  cash, do not know exactly how and what do credit cards work for us. First of all,
  we can only cut up our cards if our cards are all paid up, i.e. there’s no balance
  at all to pay, in which case, we shouldn’t even be in this conversation at all.

  no problems and the full credit line was available for transfers. If you are having
  problems with transfers, call them. I wouldn’t cancel a credit card, unless there
  is a ridiculous yearly fee and low credit limit. Having a credit card and using
  it responsibly is the best way to go. I filed bankruptcy in 2003. It took 11 years
  before I got approved for credit. I did have one card, Orchard Bank, now CreditOne.
  I used it monthly on Arrowhead water delivery, I never paid it off each month, just
  shy of paying it off, say $1.00-$2.00 left each month. It showed, once my bankruptcy
  was off of my record, that I was in good standing for around 7 years. If you have
  a credit card and don’t use it, no good credit is reported. If you pay a credit
  card bill off completely each month, again, no help. But a monthly credit, showing
  that it’s being used and is in good standing, that’s what creditors want to see.
  Also, if you’ve had a credit card for a while and say had a late payment and your
  interest went up, wait about six months and then contact company and ask if the
  negative can be removed. You can also call to request a credit line increase. You
  can also call and ask if your interest rate can be lowered. Another thing, if you
  start getting loads of credit offers, do your homework on the company, their reputation,
  find message boards or BBB reviews. Also, if you apply for a credit card, it dings
  your credit score, even if approved. So don’t apply for a bunch of cards around
  the same time, space them apart because this also doesn’t look good on your credit
  report. Most importantly, don’t go and buy things just because you have a credit
  card with a $5,000 limit or more or less. Use your credit cards within your financial
  means, just because you have that credit card with that limit, doesn’t mean you
  go on a shopping spree. Lastly, make more than your monthly payment, double it or
  more if you can. If you pay by check (who uses checks anymore? Right) send a letter
  with each payment, and I mean every single payment that says “Please Note: ALL extra
  monies sent with this payment are to be put towards the principle of the loan.”.
  Do this with car, mortgage or other types of payments/loans that you have, including
  credit cards, that have interest rates. This pays down your principle faster and
  with much less interest. For instance, I purchased a used car in 2008, sticker price
  was $8,000. Add taxes, insurance and a 72 month loan, total price for that used
  car after 72 months, $18,000. I made double payments usually, sometimes triple payments.
  Occasionally I could only pay the monthly payment of $250.00. I got the car in late
  2008, first payment due January 2009. I would have finished paying off this car
  in January this year if I just made the monthly payment. Instead, I had it paid
  off in just under 2 years. I had the option to make payments online, I didn’t because
  the online payments do not give you an option of saying “Any and all extra monies
  sent are to be placed on the principal of the loan.” What would have cost me $18,000
  if I’d made minimum payments monthly, cost me around $10,500 total. I saved approximately
  $7,500. You do the math guys. If you have credit cards that you pay online and have
  opted out of paper statements, change that now, insist on paper statements (unless
  you can print out the payment slip from the statement (you can on many) and even
  if you cannot double a payment, maybe you can add $5-$20 to your minimum payment
  due, sent a check and EVERY SINGLE PAYMENT, add a hand written note “To Whom it
  May Concern, Any and all extra monies sent are to be placed towards the Principal
  of the loan. Sincerely, (enter your name here)”. Take a picture of the Statement
  your check and your note. I’ve even written on the front of the check itself those
  same words, but it can be hard to read sometimes, I wrote it in and/or under the
  “note” section of the check, but paper is better. Get a small notebook 5″ x 3″ or
  close to it. Good Luck! I wish you all the best of luck. I hope that I have helped

  I read the comments from people regarding their negative experiences with credit
  they usually fall into one of these categories:1 a person with poor credit doesn’t
  get the deal they think they should.  If you have poor credit (usually indicative
  of a bad credit score) you will not get the deals that are touted.2 a person who
  signs up for something and it turns out to be something different.  The laws regarding
  disclosure for credit card agreements and loans are very specific and set up for
  the overly ignorant.  If you read the print (not the fine print) the print, you’ll
  know the deal.  Most people don’t do this and then they blame the creditor for their
  failure to read and understand what they are signing up for.3 a person who buys
  on credit what they shouldn’t.  If you don’t have the means to pay something off
  within a reasonable time, and its not a real asset, then don’t use credit.  Otherwise,
  you will be in an endless cycle of debt.  I understand how hard this is but it requires
  living below your means and waiting until you have the funds.  Not a concept practiced
  in this country.When I read the comments from people regarding their negative experiences

  have one in my wallet.  I maybe used it once when I needed a roof repair of $1,200
  and later when the whole roof was falling apart, Slate didn’t help me.   As a matter
  of fact, they only would lend me $500 and had to pay it back in 2 months for the
  repair.  And, I have had my mortgage at Chase for years.   They wouldn’t even give
  me a home improvement loan.  Wouldn’t a roof be an improvement if it was falling
  apart?   I finally went to Enerbank and they lent me $3,500, no interest, for one
  year, same as cash.  Steer clear of this card.   Check out all the small print.

  owner: in part I agree with you but your “oh poor small business owner” meme is
  pathetic.  If your customers won’t pay the extra 5% that you tack on for the credit
  card charge then post a cash/credit price notice on the store’s door or inform the
  customer at the register. There are plenty of us “small business owner’s” (me included)
  that have found ways to adjust to the on going slump in the economy. The first is
  to notify your state’s Small Business Association of your need for representation
  in Congress. Then YOU need to get out and protest, organize and vote for a progressive
  candidate that realizes that America runs on small business enterprise and HOLD
  THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE! Too often we think this party or that party is our salvation.
  Well what does it feel like now that you have been saved? Banks own this country
  when it should be “WE THE PEOPLE”. WE are the government but instead we have allowed
  our elected to turn government into BIG business and THEY make all the money and
  never have to pay for credit because we the small business and taxpaying middle
  class subsidize them in lots of ways with our tax money. You’ve drank the “kool-aid”
  and don’t like the after taste. Well poor you…go out and do something about it.To

  has no understanding that small business owners are paying 3 to 5 points tax on

  like paying 10% more for merchandise and services to cover the costs for taking
  cards in the first place. Wake up people. If you want to get out of credit card
  trouble, file bankruptcy and you can intentionally hurt your chances and teach yourself

  you have the card. After that time period there is a balance transfer fee, but within
  the first 60 days it is completely free to transfer your balances onto Chase Slate.

  Transferring your card balance every 15 months is idiotic. Paying off your balance
  EVERY month is the only smart thing you can do with a credit card. Don’t pay what
  you don’t have. If you use a credit card as an extension of your checking account
  (i.e. paying it off regularly), then you should be fine, but most people don’t,
  and credit card companies are literally banking on you not paying the full balance
  each month. Just avoid plastic if you want to master your money.Hahaha. Don’t get

  Johns,I can assure you that this card features $0 in balance transfer fees, as long
  as you transfer your money within the first 60 days of card ownership. It’s one

  good advice, but the article seems to an advertisement for Chase.Right after the
  holidays most people have racked up a balance on their credit cards and are wondering
  how they are going to pay it off. Chase Slate is a strong solution, offering a 15-month
  0% APR on both balance transfers and purchases. Many cards offer a 0% intro APR,
  but the best part about Slate is that you won’t pay any balance transfer fees to
  move your balance(s) onto this card. That’s a huge win, since these fees are typically
  3% of the balance you’re transferring, which can add up to big money. For example,
  if you’re transferring $5,000 you’d probably pay $150 in fees with other cards.
  With Slate you pay absolutely nothing to transfer your money, and you have 15 interest-free
  months to make payments against the balance, which means you can pay it down completely
  or at least get a head start on reducing it. Just make sure you transfer your balance
  in the first 60 days to take advantage of the $0 balance transfer fee, as after
  that time there will be a fee.In addition to the 0% intro APR on balance transfers,
  you’ll also pay no interest for 15 months on purchases. This is a great way to make
  any big (or small) purchases you need and save money on interest fees for over a
  year. Plus, Slate has no annual fee and a fairly low ongoing APR after the 0% intro
  APR period which is important if you plan to carry a balance after the 15 months
  are up.Another huge point in Slate’s favor is that it’s available to those with
  good credit. A good credit score is typically considered to be above 660. Usually
  credit cards with the best offers are only available to people with excellent credit
  histories, but Slate has all the great features offered to excellent credit consumers
  and is open to those with merely good credit. So if you’ve missed a payment or two,
  or had some other minor hits on your credit report you will likely still qualify
  for this card. Of course, Slate also considers other factors like your annual salary
  and wages, your other annual income and a review of your debt, but in general those
  with good credit have a good shot.World travelers will appreciate that Slate now
  offers Chip and PIN technology. Chip-enabled cards are usually required when traveling
  outside the U.S., and if your card doesn’t have one you might not be able to use
  it when traveling internationally.Things To ConsiderChase Slate is a smart way to
  gradually pay down your balance over the course of the 15-month 0% intro APR period,
  and after the no-interest period is up it continues to offer reasonable ongoing
  APRs. However, if you think you might be carrying your balance for a prolonged time,
  Barclay Ring Mastercard might be a better solution for you. It doesn’t have a 0%
  intro APR period, but features no balance transfer fee, no annual fee and a one
  of the lowest ongoing APRs we’ve ever seen â\x80\x93 8.00% . Plus it gives you 1%
  back on the amount you transfer.Slate’s chip-enabled card makes it easy to travel
  internationally, but there is a 3% foreign transaction fee for each purchase you
  make. This fee can add up, particularly if you’re taking a long vacation and charging
  most purchases onto your card. If this is a deal-breaker for you, BankAmericard
  Travel Rewards Credit Card is an alternative to Slate that features no foreign transaction
  fees, no annual fee, 1.5 reward points for every dollar spent and a 12-month 0%
  intro APR.Although Slate is a great balance transfer card, it doesn’t offer any
  rewards. If you’re interested in a balance transfer card that also has strong cash
  back rewards, take a look at the Discover it â\x80\x93 Balance Transfer card which
  has a 18-month 0% intro APR, 5% cash back in categories that rotate quarterly, 1%
  cash back on everything else and no annual fee  (note: the card does have a 3% balance
  transfer fee).Should You Apply For the Slate from Chase?Chase Slate is a very strong
  card and is unique in that it lets you transfer your existing balances free of charge
  and pay no interest for 15 months on balance transfers and purchases. We highly
  recommend Chase Slate, and it is our best-ranked balance transfer card. It’s particularly
  appealing because it’s available to those with good (rather than just excellent)
  credit and features the chip-and-PIN technology that’s so important when traveling
  overseas.There are some potential drawbacks though, including no rewards and a foreign
  transaction fee. If these are concerns for you, check out the above-mentioned alternatives.

  if you’re transferring $5,000 you’d probably pay $150 in fees with other cards.
  With Slate you pay absolutely nothing to transfer your money, and you have 15 interest-free
  months to make payments against the balance, which means you can pay it down completely
  or at least get a head start on reducing it. Just make sure you transfer your balance
  in the first 60 days to take advantage of the $0 balance transfer fee, as after
  that time there will be a fee.In addition to the 0% intro APR on balance transfers,
  you’ll also pay no interest for 15 months on purchases. This is a great way to make
  any big (or small) purchases you need and save money on interest fees for over a
  year. Plus, Slate has no annual fee and a fairly low ongoing APR after the 0% intro
  APR period which is important if you plan to carry a balance after the 15 months
  are up.Another huge point in Slate’s favor is that it’s available to those with
  good credit. A good credit score is typically considered to be above 660. Usually
  credit cards with the best offers are only available to people with excellent credit
  histories, but Slate has all the great features offered to excellent credit consumers
  and is open to those with merely good credit. So if you’ve missed a payment or two,
  or had some other minor hits on your credit report you will likely still qualify
  for this card. Of course, Slate also considers other factors like your annual salary
  and wages, your other annual income and a review of your debt, but in general those
  with good credit have a good shot.World travelers will appreciate that Slate now
  offers Chip and PIN technology. Chip-enabled cards are usually required when traveling

  it when traveling internationally.Things To ConsiderChase Slate is a smart way to
  gradually pay down your balance over the course of the 15-month 0% intro APR period,
  and after the no-interest period is up it continues to offer reasonable ongoing
  APRs. However, if you think you might be carrying your balance for a prolonged time,

  recommend Chase Slate, and it is our best-ranked balance transfer card. It’s particularly
  appealing because it’s available to those with good (rather than just excellent)
  credit and features the chip-and-PIN technology that’s so important when traveling
  overseas.There are some potential drawbacks though, including no rewards and a foreign
  transaction fee. If these are concerns for you, check out the above-mentioned alternatives.

  most people have racked up a balance on their credit cards and are wondering how
  they are going to pay it off. Chase Slate is a strong solution, offering a 15-month
  0% APR on both balance transfers and purchases. Many cards offer a 0% intro APR,
  but the best part about Slate is that you won’t pay any balance transfer fees to
  move your balance(s) onto this card. That’s a huge win, since these fees are typically
  3% of the balance you’re transferring, which can add up to big money. For example,
  if you’re transferring $5,000 you’d probably pay $150 in fees with other cards.
  With Slate you pay absolutely nothing to transfer your money, and you have 15 interest-free
  months to make payments against the balance, which means you can pay it down completely
  or at least get a head start on reducing it. Just make sure you transfer your balance
  in the first 60 days to take advantage of the $0 balance transfer fee, as after
  that time there will be a fee.In addition to the 0% intro APR on balance transfers,
  you’ll also pay no interest for 15 months on purchases. This is a great way to make
  any big (or small) purchases you need and save money on interest fees for over a
  year. Plus, Slate has no annual fee and a fairly low ongoing APR after the 0% intro
  APR period which is important if you plan to carry a balance after the 15 months
  are up.Another huge point in Slate’s favor is that it’s available to those with
  good credit. A good credit score is typically considered to be above 660. Usually
  credit cards with the best offers are only available to people with excellent credit
  histories, but Slate has all the great features offered to excellent credit consumers
  and is open to those with merely good credit. So if you’ve missed a payment or two,
  or had some other minor hits on your credit report you will likely still qualify
  for this card. Of course, Slate also considers other factors like your annual salary
  and wages, your other annual income and a review of your debt, but in general those
  with good credit have a good shot.World travelers will appreciate that Slate now
  offers Chip and PIN technology. Chip-enabled cards are usually required when traveling
  outside the U.S., and if your card doesn’t have one you might not be able to use
  it when traveling internationally.Things To ConsiderChase Slate is a smart way to
  gradually pay down your balance over the course of the 15-month 0% intro APR period,
  and after the no-interest period is up it continues to offer reasonable ongoing
  APRs. However, if you think you might be carrying your balance for a prolonged time,
  Barclay Ring Mastercard might be a better solution for you. It doesn’t have a 0%
  intro APR period, but features no balance transfer fee, no annual fee and a one
  of the lowest ongoing APRs we’ve ever seen â\x80\x93 8.00% . Plus it gives you 1%
  back on the amount you transfer.Slate’s chip-enabled card makes it easy to travel
  internationally, but there is a 3% foreign transaction fee for each purchase you
  make. This fee can add up, particularly if you’re taking a long vacation and charging
  most purchases onto your card. If this is a deal-breaker for you, BankAmericard
  Travel Rewards Credit Card is an alternative to Slate that features no foreign transaction
  fees, no annual fee, 1.5 reward points for every dollar spent and a 12-month 0%
  intro APR.Although Slate is a great balance transfer card, it doesn’t offer any
  rewards. If you’re interested in a balance transfer card that also has strong cash
  back rewards, take a look at the Discover it â\x80\x93 Balance Transfer card which
  has a 18-month 0% intro APR, 5% cash back in categories that rotate quarterly, 1%
  cash back on everything else and no annual fee  (note: the card does have a 3% balance
  transfer fee).Should You Apply For the Slate from Chase?Chase Slate is a very strong

  declined.  I have excellent credit with not one negative mark going back 20 years.
  \ Today I cancelled it and the customer service rep asked why.  I explained that
  the low credit limit was of no use and that I had been declined for a higher limit.
  \ She showed no concern and was only too happy to proceed in canceling my unused
  account.  Don’t waste your time with Chase and this card.  I will make sure I NEVER
  do business with any company that has CHASE in the name.  What a rip off and a complete
  waste of time.This card is a big waste of time and was of no help to our family

  away from using the Chase card. When they purchased the original company who owned
  my card. My rate jumped from 20% to 26.24% and decreased my credit line. How disappointing
  and I was paying on time as well. Gonna think twice when I use this card. At no
  time have I been able to get them to lower the rate even though for close to 8 years
  I have paid on time. The interest that accumulates on the card is outrageous though
  I enjoy the Blueprint program which the other company didn’t have.\nIts was too
  hard to get a card after going through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and getting a credit
  card 2 years later. Now for those who are trying to get a card they are really tough
  I heard…. but looking for a new card w/zero interest….I’m going with Capital One
  who was generous to give me twice the credit line than Chase and 24% w/ zero interest
  for 12 months with 3% transfer fee. Of course I will keep my Chase card using it
  once a month just to keep it active because I have a long credit history of 8 years.\nI’ve
  sold a great deal of credit cards while working for TD Bank and they seem easy to
  get a card even though I was not approved. But usually you had to have excellent
  credit.Finally getting away from using the Chase card. When they purchased the original
