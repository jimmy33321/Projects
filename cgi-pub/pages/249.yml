                  ABSTRACTION IN THE FORMATION OF CONCEPTS
- "             \n"
- |2
                  The term “abstraction” is the
- |2
                      usual expression in medi- eval philosophical
- |2
                      terminology for several processes distinguished in Aristotle's writings by
- |2
                      different terms, viz., aphairesis
- |2
                      (ἄφαιρεσις)
- |2
                      and korismos
- |2
                      (χωρισμός)
- |2
                      described in different ways. In all probability, it was Boethius who
- |2
                      introduced the Latin abstractio andabstrahere to translate these Greek nouns and the re- lated verbs.
- |2
                  The main theories of concept formation in Greek antiquity were those of
- |2
                      Democritus, Plato, and Aris- totle (Beare,
- |2
                      1906). According to all these theories, sense perception and intellectual
- |2
                      cognition have to be distinguished both by their objects and by their
- |2
                      nature. For Democritus and the Atomists, knowledge as well as sense
- |2
                      perception arises from effluvia of atoms which are continually thrown off
- |2
                      from the surfaces of physical objects, and eventually enter the percipient
- |2
                      through the various sense organs. Intellectual cognition depends on
- |2
                      finer and subtler effluvia. This theory was further developed by the
- |2
                      Epicureans.
- |2
                  The difference between sense objects and the objects of intellectual
- |2
                      cognition were also recognized by Plato but accounted for in a very
- |2
                      different way. It is gener- ally assumed that
- |2
                      Plato adopted the Heraclitean view that the physical world is in continuous
- |2
                      flux so that it never exhibits stable objects for sensory cognition.
- |2
                      Because we know, for example, the objects of moral ideals and of
- |2
                      mathematics, it was necessary to assume a nonsensory origin of this
- |2
                      knowledge. Objects of knowledge really are; objects of sense are
- |2
                      perpetually becoming. The objects of intellectual cognition, ac- cordingly, must have been stored up in us
- |2
                      from a previous existence. Knowledge, properly so-called, is
- |2
                      reminiscence.
- |2
                  As the Platonic Forms are separate from the physical world of flux, the
- |2
                      knowledge of Forms can only be suggested by the approximations to them that
- |2
                      the physical world is able temporarily to manifest. The theory, which
- |2
                      Plato expressly defended in the Meno (81C), Phaedo (73A), and Phaedrus (247C)
- |2
                      and nowhere expressly abandoned, is that we possess knowledge of the
- |2
                      Forms from a previous existence, and that so-called learning is really
- |2
                      reminiscence. Accordingly, we should not expect to find anything like a
- |2
                      doctrine of abstrac- tion in Plato's
- |2
                      writings. The need for such a doctrine as we find in Aristotle is
- |2
                      occasioned by Aristotle's insistence that the Forms of material things are
- |2
                      not separate realities, yet we seem to be able to consider them
- |2
                      without considering the matter or without con-
- |2
                          sidering other concrete features of material things. Separate
- |2
                      Forms provide us with difficulties but not
- |2
                       with this particular one. Plato's insistence that we are
- |2
                      acquainted with objects that are nowhere completely realized in the
- |2
                      physical world requires a different ac- count of
- |2
                      our knowledge of such objects, and Plato found the theory of reminiscence
- |2
                      the only suitable explanation.
- |2
                  But if there is no doctrine of abstraction in Plato's works, there are
- |2
                      passages which might have suggested the doctrine to his successor,
- |2
                      Aristotle. It is sufficient to mention here only the passage in the Phaedrus (249B-C) where it is written that
- |2
                      “man must needs understand the language of Forms, passing from
- |2
                      a plurality of perceptions to a unity gathered together by
- |2
                      reasoning” (Hackforth, 1952). Since, in the very next sentence,
- |2
                      we are informed that “this understanding is the recollection of
- |2
                      those things which our souls beheld aforetime...,” the intention
- |2
                      of the passage is clear enough. But the notion that this unity
- |2
                      (ἕν) is somehow connected with a multitude of
- |2
                      perceptions might have been one of the suggestions which led Aristotle to
- |2
                      his doctrine of abstraction.
- |2
                  It was Aristotle's view that form and matter are joined in physical objects
- |2
                      that made a theory of abstrac- tion both
- |2
                      possible and necessary: possible because forms otherwise could not be known
- |2
                      by way of per- ception and necessary because
- |2
                      now perception is the only immediate source of cognition. Aristotle uses
- |2
                      the term “abstraction”
- |2
                      (ἀφαίρεσις)
- |2
                      in connection with the objects of mathematics, which
- |2
                      “Platonists” had held were separate from the material
- |2
                      world (Ross, p. 566). Aristotle maintained that these mathematical
- |2
                      features were, in fact, inseparable from material things but could be
- |2
                      thought of separately. In the Metaphysics (1060a
- |2
                      28-1061b 31) the process is described as fol-
- |2
                      lows: in the mathematician's investigations, he takes away
- |2
                      everything that is sensible, e.g., weight and light-
- |2
                          ness, hardness and softness, heat and cold, and all other
- |2
                      sensible contrarieties, and leaves only quantity and continuity in one,
- |2
                      two, or three dimensions, as well as the affections
- |2
                      (πάθη) of these quantities. Elsewhere
- |2
                          (Post. Anal. 81b 3; De
- |2
                      anima 431b 12ff.; Nic. Eth. 1142a; De caelo III, 1, 299a 15) we are repeatedly informed
- |2
                      that the objects of mathematics are treated as separate but cannot exist
- |2
                      separately. It is this for- mulation which
- |2
                      is repeated throughout the subsequent history of abstraction both by those
- |2
                      who follow Aris- totle and by those who reject
- |2
                      his views.
- |2
                  A point here is worthy of remark. The authors from Boethius to modern times
- |2
                      speak of abstracting forms (both accidental and mathematical) from
- |2
                      matter, whereas Aristotle (as Owens has pointed out) in de- scribing mathematical abstraction speaks of
- |2
                      taking away the sensible qualities, and leaving only the quan- titative features of physical objects.

                  Although the process of coming to know the univer-
- |2
                      sal from repeated perceptions of particulars is notcalled abstraction—Aristotle here uses
- |2
                      “separation”
- |2
                      (χω̂ρίζειν)—there
- |2
                      is at least one passage which, indi- rectly,
- |2
                      connects these two activities (Post. Anal. 81b 3).
- |2
                      In both these cases, induction
- |2
                      (ἐπαγῶγή)
- |2
                      is associated with the process of coming to know the universal,
- |2
                      whether mathematical or physical. In the case of mathematical abstraction,
- |2
                      it is sometimes indicated that the observed object suggests something which
- |2
                      is not actually presented, but the prevailing impression is that the
- |2
                      mathematical features are literally in the object, and are discovered by
- |2
                      removing from consid- eration all other
- |2
                      sensible qualities.
- |2
                  The description of cognition given in De anima
- |2
                      and in the Parva naturalia is important for
- |2
                      the later devel- opment of the doctrine of
- |2
                      abstraction as we find it in medieval writers. The forms of sensible
- |2
                      objects without their matter enter the soul, so that we know objects
- |2
                      by the presence of their forms in consciousness. The form as it exists in
- |2
                      the soul is, presumably, numerically different though specifically the same
- |2
                      as the form in the object of perception (De
- |2
                      anima III; VIII, 431b 26ff.). The forms of objects existing in
- |2
                      the soul are, Aristotle assumes, the fundamental elements of thought
- |2
                      which are the referents of the verbal symbols of spoken discourse (De interpretatione, I, 16a 3ff; cf. De anima III, 6, 430a 26-430b 33). So, in many cases at
- |2
                      any rate, the general terms of discourse stand for isolable objects of
- |2
                      intellectual consideration. There are, how-
- |2
                      ever, exceptions to this, the most important of which are the
- |2
                      analogical or systematically ambiguous terms of metaphysics. Still, the
- |2
                      assumption that verbal terms usually stand for affections of the soul is
- |2
                      one of the important ingredients of the doctrine of abstraction which
- |2
                      was later developed by the medieval philoso-
- |2
                      phers.
- |2
                  There are two doctrines of Aristotle which throw some light on his views
- |2
                      about abstraction. One is the contention that human cognition first
- |2
                      comprehends the generic features of physical things and only later
- |2
                      comes to the specific differentiae (Physica I, 1).
- |2
                      The other is the view that the essence of an organism is discovered
- |2
                      regressively by first knowing the activities, then the powers, and by
- |2
                      subsequently discovering the essence on which such powers depend (De anima II). The former doctrine indicates that
- |2
                      there are generic con- cepts. The latter
- |2
                      suggests that the concepts of essences, in the case of those of organisms,
- |2
                      are really no more than conjunctions of powers. But the view that an
- |2
                      essence is an essential unity obviously conflicts with this, because the
- |2
                      coexistence of powers expressed by a conjunction of formulae could not
- |2
                      constitute the sort of unity of essence that Aristotle seemed to have had
- |2
                       in mind. It is, therefore, difficult to understand exactly how
- |2
                      the form of anything comes to exist in the soul as an essential unity.
- |2
                  Two main features, then, characterize Aristotle's view of abstraction:
- |2
                      formal aspects of physical reality exist in the soul as separate from
- |2
                      matter even though such a separation is impossible in the physical
- |2
                      world itself. This is true of generic concepts, of mathematical
- |2
                      aspects of things, and, of course, the specific concepts of things.
- |2
                      Cognition occurs when a form exists in the soul.
- |2
                  That abstraction need not involve any falsification is insisted upon by the
- |2
                      medievals, and the first state- ment of this
- |2
                      is to be found in Aristotle. The mathe-
- |2
                      matician is concerned with the shape and size of objects such as the
- |2
                      sun or the moon, for example; but he does not consider them as limits of
- |2
                      natural bodies, or with any properties of shape or size insofar as they
- |2
                      are aspects of physical objects. On the other hand, he separates
- |2
                      shape, etc., though without any falsity result-
- |2
                      ing from such conceptual separation (Physica II,
- |2
                      2, 193b 33ff.).
- |2
                  The accounts which have come down concerning the theories of
- |2
                      concept-formation of Stoics and Epi- cureans
- |2
                      contain nothing that can properly be described as a theory of abstraction.
- |2
                      Neither of these schools accepted the form-matter distinction; they both
- |2
                          main- tained a materialistic view of
- |2
                      nature, and the Stoics, at least, were nominalists in some sense.
- |2
                  For the Stoics, the main function of reason was the grasp of the conclusion
- |2
                      of demonstrations such as the existence of gods and their providential
- |2
                      activity. Gen- eral notions
- |2
                      (νουμένα), they
- |2
                      maintained, are gained by contact or by resemblance; some come from
- |2
                      analogy, still others by composition or contrariety. In another
- |2
                      testimony, general notions are said to arise by way of enlargement or
- |2
                      diminution of what is perceived, or by privation (Diog. Laërt.
- |2
                      VII, 52-53).
- |2
                  Epicurus and his school, in addition to their atomistic materialism, held
- |2
                      that we see, for example, shapes, and think of shapes by virtue of the
- |2
                      entrance into the body of something coming from external objects. The efflu- ence of atoms coming from the surfaces of
- |2
                      physical objects enters the sense organs and produces images.
- |2
                      Universal ideas are stored in the mind so that when, for instance, the word
- |2
                      “man” is heard, it calls up the shape stored in the
- |2
                      mind. As all this must reduce to a physical pattern, it is clear that all
- |2
                      notions are ulti- mately derived from
- |2
                      perception by contact, analogy, resemblance, or conjunction. None of this
- |2
                      can be called abstraction.
- |2
                  Since Plotinus rejected the Aristotelian theory of sensory cognition, there
- |2
                      is no place for a doctrine of abstraction in his account of our conceptual knowledge003
- |2
                       (Enneads IV, 6, 1-3). The same remark holds
- |2
                      for Au- gustine. In his account of sensory
- |2
                      cognition, the soul suffers no changes from the sense organs, but is essen- tially active, taking note of changes
- |2
                      in the body by a kind of vital attention. Hence there can be no taking
- |2
                      of a form into the soul from physical nature. An ab- straction, therefore, is out of the question in his
- |2
                      view of perception. The doctrine that the laws of numbers and of
- |2
                      wisdom are somehow given to human conscious-
- |2
                      ness by interior illumination from a divine source takes the place
- |2
                      of abstraction. As Augustine's views on these and other questions were
- |2
                      derived from Plo- tinus and, indirectly, from
- |2
                      Plato, this is to be expected.
- |2
                  The commentator, Alexander of Aphrodisias, uses the phrase
- |2
                      ἐξ
- |2
                      ἀφαιρέσεως
- |2
                      in describing the process of ob- taining any
- |2
                      form in consciousness as separated from the material which it determines in
- |2
                      the external world, and it is from this source (Alexander, De anima, pp. 107, 34) that Boethius derived his
- |2
                      account of abstraction (In Isagogen Porphyrii
- |2
                      commenta I, 11).
- |2
                  According to Boethius, there are many things which cannot actually be
- |2
                      separated but which are separated by the soul and by
- |2
                      thought—e.g., no one can actually separate a triangle from its
- |2
                      material substratum, but a person can mentally separate the triangle and
- |2
                      its properties from matter, and contemplate it. This sepa- ration does not involve any falsification because falsifi- cation can only occur when
- |2
                      something is asserted to exist separately which does not or cannot exist
- |2
                          sepa- rately. Thus the separation
- |2
                      achieved by abstraction is not only not false, but is indispensable to the
- |2
                      discovery of truth. This means, we propose, that abstraction provides
- |2
                      the concepts which are to be united in affirm-
- |2
                          ative propositions which truly state what charac- teristics things possess.
- |2
                  This account of abstraction follows along lines al-
- |2
                          ready laid down by Aristotle and is repeated, with elaborations,
- |2
                      by the logicians of the twelfth century. Thus Abelard tells us that,
- |2
                      although matter and form are always together, the mind can consider each
- |2
                          sepa- rately. Thus abstraction does not
- |2
                      falsify because there is no assertion that anything has just the
- |2
                      abstracted property and no others. The mind considers only one feature
- |2
                      but does not assert its separation in fact from other features.
- |2
                      “For the thing does not have only it, but the thing is
- |2
                      considered only as having it” (Logica
- |2
                          ingredientibus). John of Salisbury provides a similar
- |2
                      account. In abstracting a line or surface, the abstracting intellect does
- |2
                      not conceive it as existing apart from matter. Abstraction is simply a
- |2
                      contemplation of form without considering its matter even though the
- |2
                      form cannot exist without the matter (Metalogicon
- |2
                      II, Ch. 20). Again, some things resemble others and the mind abstracts
- |2
                      from these particular individuals and con
- |2
                      siders only the resemblance. In this way, the concept of
- |2
                      “man” is abstracted from the perceptions of individ- uals, and the concept of
- |2
                      “animal” from man, horse, etc. (ibid.).
- |2
                  Similar views about abstraction are developed by the anonymous author of
- |2
                          De intellectibus (cf. V. Cousin, 1859)
- |2
                      and it is clear that this general agreement can be accounted for by the
- |2
                      fact that all the schoolmen of this period read Boethius, and, perhaps,
- |2
                      also by the influence of Abelard.
- |2
                  The Arabic translations of Aristotle and some of his earlier Greek
- |2
                      commentators made the doctrine of ab-
- |2
                      straction available to the Islamic and Jewish philoso- phers. But there were also translations or epitomes
- |2
                      of the writings of Plotinus and Proclus and, even when there was no
- |2
                      confusion between Neo-Platonic and Aristotelian views, attempts were made
- |2
                      to harmonize Aristotelian and Neo-Platonic doctrine. In particular,
- |2
                      the Neo-Platonic system of emanations was grafted onto that doctrine of
- |2
                      Aristotle which concerned the connection of the Agent Intellect to
- |2
                      individual human cognitive activities. The Active Intellect in
- |2
                      Aristotle's psychology was identified with the last Intelligence. In
- |2
                      some of these systems, the illuminative activity of the active intellect
- |2
                      consists in the radiation of forms into the material world and into the
- |2
                      human mind. Attempts to combine this doctrine with the doctrine of
- |2
                      abstraction produced strange consequences. In Avicenna's (Ibn Sina,
- |2
                      980-1037) treatises on psychol- ogy, for
- |2
                      example, there are various degrees of abstrac-
- |2
                      tion of forms which correspond to the ascending se- quence of cognitive powers, the sensitive, the
- |2
                      imaginative, the estimative, and finally the intellective. His account of
- |2
                      abstraction of sensible forms seems to conform to the Aristotelian
- |2
                      psychology of taking the form of a material object apart from the
- |2
                      matter (Avicenna, Psychology, p. 40). But forms
- |2
                      which have no embodiment or which are embodied accidentally must be
- |2
                      received from the Agent Intellect when the individual human souls have been
- |2
                      prepared by the appropriate sense experience to receive these emana- tions (Avicenna, De
- |2
                          anima 5; cf. Al-Ghazali, Meta- physics, pp. 174ff.). This explanation of how we
- |2
                      know the nature of qualities and of things thus combines a theory of
- |2
                      abstraction properly so-called with a doctrine which accounts for
- |2
                      conceptual knowledge by emana- tions of forms
- |2
                      from a suprahuman source. This made it congenial to many of the earlier
- |2
                      scholastics of the thirteenth century.
- |2
                  Another feature of Avicenna's views must be men-
- |2
                          tioned: the doctrine of distinctions. This became im- portant for the scholastics of the
- |2
                      thirteenth and four- teenth centuries, and
- |2
                      figures in the discussions of the seventeenth century. One of the important
- |2
                      sources is004
- |2
                       Aristotle's statement in the Topics that
- |2
                      “if one thing is capable of existing without the other, the
- |2
                      former will not be the same as the latter” (Topics Book VII, Ch. 2; Becker, p. 152 b34). This was taken to be
- |2
                      the test of a real distinction of two things. According to Avicenna,
- |2
                      that which is asserted is other than that which is not asserted, and what
- |2
                      is conceded is different from what is not conceded (De
- |2
                          anima I, 1). So, if someone can assert or concede that he
- |2
                      exists even though he does not assert or admit that his body exists,
- |2
                      this is sufficient ground for holding a real distinction between the mind
- |2
                      and the body. A similar idea under- lies
- |2
                      Descartes' mind-body distinction as a consequence of cogito, ergo sum.
- |2
                  Yet another aspect of Avicenna's thought, important to the history of
- |2
                      abstraction, is his doctrine of the common nature. Although Avicenna
- |2
                      vehemently denies that universals have any extra-mental existence and
- |2
                      although he asseverates that individuals alone exist, he maintains that a
- |2
                      nature can be contemplated which, in itself, is neither one nor many
- |2
                      (numerically) but is simply the nature that it intrinsically is: horseness
- |2
                      is simply horseness. This theory of natures was to be used by the
- |2
                      thirteenth-century scholastics in diverse ways. Aquinas draws upon it to
- |2
                      avoid the Platonic paradox about the one and the many in his De ente et essentia, and it is essential to the
- |2
                      views of Duns Scotus. Accord- ing to the
- |2
                      latter, the common nature has a unity less than numerical unity so that the
- |2
                      paradox of one nature or form in many individuals is again avoided. And
- |2
                      it continues to receive support in the fourteenth century in the
- |2
                      critique of Ockham by Richard of Campsall:Illa natura... non est pleures nec una (Logica, Ch. 15).
- |2
                  This theory that a nature as such is neither one nor many is essential to
- |2
                      Scotus' doctrine of abstraction. For although such a nature cannot be
- |2
                      separated, even by divine power, from the individual differences by
- |2
                      which each thing is individuated, it can nonetheless be con- sidered apart from such individuating
- |2
                      features by ab- straction.
- |2
                  Al-Ghazali (1058-1111) criticized Avicenna's view of abstraction along lines
- |2
                      which immediately call to mind similar criticisms made later by some fourteenth- century nominalists
- |2
                      (especially Ockham) and by some of the nominalists of the seventeenth and
- |2
                      eighteenth centuries (especially Hobbes and Berkeley). Against the
- |2
                      view that the intelligible universal in the intellect is divested of all
- |2
                      specifying or individuating determi-
- |2
                      nations, Al-Ghazali urges that everything in the intel- lect is derived from the senses and retains all the
- |2
                          con- crete determinateness of sense
- |2
                      experience. True, the intellect can separate parts of a composite, but
- |2
                      each part thus separated is just as individual as was the aggregate
- |2
                      from which it was separated. Each wholly
- |2
                       determinate part of an aggregate thus separated func- tions as a universal insofar as it is
- |2
                      conceived as standing in a relation to all similar individuals, and serves
- |2
                      as an image for all other things similar to it (Tahafut..., 1958; cf. Averroës, Tahafut, 1954). Al-Ghazali may, therefore, be regarded as a precursor
- |2
                      of the sort of criticism of abstraction which later nominalists in
- |2
                      Christendom were to exploit. There is, of course, no likelihood of any
- |2
                      literary influence because this part of Al-Ghazali was not accessible in
- |2
                      Latin until the sixteenth century (Zedler, 1961). Moreover,
- |2
                      Averroës opposed Al-Ghazali on this point and continued to
- |2
                      uphold the Aristotelian doctrine. We find that Mai-
- |2
                          monides (1135-1204) also adheres to a doctrine of abstraction
- |2
                      derived mostly from Avicenna's Guide of the
- |2
                      Perplexed.
- |2
                  In the philosophical writings of the early thirteenth century in Christendom
- |2
                      attempts were made to ac- commodate the
- |2
                      views of Aristotle to those of Saint Augustine. Avicenna's writings on
- |2
                      psychology made this accommodation feasible especially to the Fran- ciscans. But we should glance at one of
- |2
                      the first at- tempts in this vein by Robert
- |2
                      Grosseteste.
- |2
                  In his commentary on the Posterior Analytics,
- |2
                      Gros- seteste taught that the mind is
- |2
                      capable of knowledge without the aid of the senses. Due to its
- |2
                      incarceration in the body, however, the mind is darkened and re- quires the aid of sensation. Accordingly,
- |2
                      abstraction of forms from the data of sensation is normally re- quired. So the intellect separates out for
- |2
                      special con- sideration the features of
- |2
                      things which are confused in sensation. Abstraction of forms usually is
- |2
                      derived from many individual objects presented to the senses. But the
- |2
                      knowledge thus attained is not of the highest grade.
- |2
                  A representative view of the Franciscans can be found in Matthew of
- |2
                      Aquasparta. Because the human soul is a sort of mean between God and
- |2
                      creatures, it has two aspects, one of which, the superior part, is
- |2
                      turned to God; the other, the inferior part, is turned toward creatures.
- |2
                      According to the doctrine of “the two faces of the
- |2
                      soul,” the correct explanation of human knowledge is a medium
- |2
                      between the position of Augustine and Aristotle.
- |2
                  Knowledge of the world is generated in man by sensation, memory, and
- |2
                      experience from which the universal concepts of art and science are
- |2
                      derived. But in order fully to understand the natures of things thus
- |2
                      abstracted from sensation we require an illumination from the Divine Light.
- |2
                      Although we do not see Divine Light in our earthly existence, we see the
- |2
                      natures of things by its means. The existence of this illumination is
- |2
                      explained as follows: we know eternal truths with certainty. These truths
- |2
                      are immutable yet everything005
- |2
                       in the world about us and our very minds are mutable. So, the
- |2
                      immutable and necessary features of our knowledge require the illumination
- |2
                      of the Divine Light.
- |2
                  Matthew adopts the Augustinian theory that the corporeal world cannot
- |2
                      produce changes in the soul (the inferior cannot affect the superior).
- |2
                      Rather the soul is actively aware of changes occurring anywhere in the
- |2
                      body. The data which the soul makes from its notice of corporeal changes
- |2
                      are rendered intelligible by the Agent Intellect which, Matthew says, is
- |2
                      what Aristotle calls abstractions. But these
- |2
                      abstractions are understood in the light of the immutable rules
- |2
                      provided by divine illumination. This combination of “abstrac- tion” and illumination is
- |2
                      to be found in a number of Franciscan thinkers of the thirteenth century.
- "                \n"
- |2
                          Saint Thomas Aquinas.
- |2
                       Aquinas expounds a theory of abstraction according to which things
- |2
                      (in the sense of objects of apprehension) can be considered, one
- |2
                      aspect apart from another, in cases in which the two things cannot exist
- |2
                      separated from one another. In cases in which one thing can exist apart
- |2
                      from another we should speak of “separation” rather
- |2
                      than abstraction (Commentary on Boethius' De
- |2
                      Trinitate, Q5, a.3). Since substance, which is the intelligible matter
- |2
                      of quantity, can exist without quantity, it is possible to consider
- |2
                      substance without quantity. Again, to consider “ani- mal” without considering
- |2
                      “stone” is not to abstractanimal from stone. Thus it is only
- |2
                      in cases where things cannot exist separately but can be considered separately that we can properly speak of abstraction.
- |2
                  Abstraction is of two kinds: the one, mathematical abstraction, involves a
- |2
                      consideration of form from sen- sible matter.
- |2
                      The other is the abstraction of the univer-
- |2
                      sal from the particular. The possibility of abstraction depends on
- |2
                      the fact that things (features of things) exist in one way in the realm of
- |2
                      matter, but in another in an intellect which apprehends them. Thus, because
- |2
                      the mind is immaterial, the natures of material things exist in the
- |2
                      mind in a way suitable to the mind, i.e., they have an immaterial existence
- |2
                      in the mind. But the simple apprehension of the mind does not involve
- |2
                      any assertion that the features of things exist thus in reality,
- |2
                      because simple apprehension is not an act which asserts or denies anything
- |2
                      at all. The mathematical abstraction which considers only the quantitative
- |2
                      features of phys- ical things does not assert
- |2
                      that lines, planes, etc., exist independently of such objects. It merely
- |2
                      considers these features without attending to other aspects of
- |2
                      physical objects, although the mathematical or quantitative features
- |2
                      cannot exist isolated from physical objects.
- |2
                  In the case of the abstraction of the universal from particulars, the mind
- |2
                      considers the specific nature of, say, man or dog, apart from the
- |2
                      individuating aspects
- |2
                       of individual men or dogs. Again, abstrahentium
- |2
                          non est mendacium (“abstraction is not
- |2
                      falsification”) be- cause the mind
- |2
                      does not assert that the specific nature of man can exist apart from
- |2
                      particular men.
- |2
                  The generic nature common to several species can be abstracted so that the
- |2
                      mind thinks only of the generic aspect of these several species and ignores
- |2
                      the specific differences. “What is joined in reality, the
- |2
                      intellect can at times receive separately, when one of the elements is not
- |2
                      included in the notion of the other” (Summa
- |2
                          contra gentiles I, c. 54, para. 3). So, because the concept
- |2
                      of the genus “animal” does not explicitly contain the
- |2
                      concept of, say, “rational,” the mind can consider
- |2
                      “animal” without considering any particular kind of
- |2
                      animal. But this “animal” is not something existing
- |2
                      apart from particular kinds of animal any more than these particular kinds
- |2
                      can exist apart from indi- vidual animals.
- |2
                      Only in the mind that apprehends the form of animal stripped of its
- |2
                      individuating and speci- fying
- |2
                      characteristics does animal as such exist (ibid., I, c. 26, para. 5).
- |2
                  Nothing exists in a genus which does not exist in some species of that genus
- |2
                      (ibid., I, c. 25, para. 2).Animal cannot exist in re without
- |2
                      the differentia “ra-
- |2
                      tional” or the differentia “irrational.”
- |2
                      Still animal can be considered without these differentiae (ibid., I, c.
- |2
                      26, para. 11). There is, however, no purely generic ex- emplar in the divine mind (Summa
- |2
                      theol. I, 15a. 3 ad 4).
- |2
                  Duns Scotus adopted from Avicenna the doctrine of a common nature which is
- |2
                      in itself neither one nor many but simply what is indicated in the
- |2
                      definition or description of such a nature. This nature can be
- |2
                      individuated in the individuals of a species by the further determination
- |2
                      of an individual difference or “haecceity” (i.e.,
- |2
                      “thisness” in contrast to
- |2
                      “quiddity” or “whatness”), or
- |2
                      it can be rendered a universal con- cept by the
- |2
                      action of the active intellect; but in itself it is neither one nor many.
- |2
                  The process of abstracting a universal concept from the common nature so
- |2
                      conceived is not a “real action” because the common
- |2
                      nature is already present in the individuals and formally distinguished
- |2
                      from the indi- vidual differences prior to
- |2
                      and independent of any action of the intellect (Duns Scotus, Quaestiones in metaphyisicorum libros, VII, q. 18;
- |2
                          Opus oxoniense II d. 1, q. 5 [q. 6], n. 5). This
- |2
                      formal distinction of the specific nature from the individual differences
- |2
                      which contract it to a numerical unity in the various individ- uals of the species applies just as
- |2
                      well to the distinction between the specific and the generic features of
- |2
                      a common nature, for these also are formally distinct in such a way
- |2
                      that the mind can think of the generic nature as such. There is, therefore,
- |2
                      no distortion or falsification in the result of abstraction, because abstrac-006
- "                    \n"
- |2
                      tion amounts to considering one aspect of a nature without
- |2
                      considering the others (Opus oxon. III, d. 14, q. 2,
- |2
                      n. 12).
- |2
                  Thus, the distinctive feature of Scotus' contribution to the doctrine of
- |2
                      abstraction depends upon his doc- trine of the
- |2
                      formal distinction between the individu-
- |2
                      ating and the common nature which exists prior to any action of mind
- |2
                      on the data of observation.
- "                \n"
- |2
                          William of Ockham.
- |2
                       Ockham uses the term “abstrac-
- |2
                          tion” and provides a number of meanings for it, but
- |2
                      he departs from his predecessors on one very important point: he denies
- |2
                      that we can think as separate what is incapable of existing separately in
- |2
                      reality. However, he allows that we can understand one thing without
- |2
                      understanding another at the same time even though the two things do, in
- |2
                      fact, coexist. Thus he states “To abstract is to understand one
- |2
                      thing without under- standing another at
- |2
                      the same time even though in reality the one is not separated from the
- |2
                      other, e.g., sometimes the intellect understands the whiteness which
- |2
                      is in milk and does not understand the sweetness of milk. Abstraction in
- |2
                      this sense can belong even to a sense, for a sense can apprehend one
- |2
                      sensible without apprehending another” (Expositio physicorum, fol. 111c).
- |2
                  In his commentary on the Sentences (II, qq. 14, 15
- |2
                      xx) Ockham tells us that the abstraction of the agent intellect is twofold.
- |2
                      On the one hand, it produces a thought (an intellection) which is either
- |2
                      intuitive or abstractive, is wholly abstracted from matter because it
- |2
                      is immaterial in itself, and has its existence in some- thing immaterial (i.e., in the soul). On the other
- |2
                      hand, the abstraction produces a universal, i.e., a universal concept
- |2
                      of a thing in representative existence.
- |2
                  In still another sense, abstraction occurs when one predicable is predicated
- |2
                      of a subject and another pre- dicable is not
- |2
                      predicable of that subject even though the latter predicable applies to the
- |2
                      subject. This takes place in mathematics. For the mathematician
- |2
                      considers only such statements as “Every body is divisible, is
- |2
                      so long and so deep,” and ignores statements about bodies
- |2
                      which pertain to motion, to the composition of matter and form in physical
- |2
                      things, etc.
- |2
                  Accordingly, Ockham allows that many things are really distinct which
- |2
                      constitute a unity, as in the case of matter and form, or substance and
- |2
                      accident. Now it is true that, in such cases, the mind can separate or
- |2
                      divide these from one another so as to understand one and not understand
- |2
                      the other. But if a and b are
- |2
                      one thing and a may not be really distinguished fromb, it is impossible that the mind may divide a fromb so as to understand either without understanding
- |2
                      the other (Sent. I, d. 2, q. 3, H).
- |2
                  Hence, Ockham rejects any abstraction of a common
- |2
                       nature or form from its instances in such a way that the mind
- |2
                      can contemplate the common nature as such. The only distinction Ockham will
- |2
                      allow is the real distinction of one thing from another thing. A distinc- tion between the common nature and an
- |2
                      individual difference which Scotus had defended is, for Ockham,
- |2
                      entirely out of the question (Sent. I d, qq. 1-4).
- |2
                  The reason why Ockham can allow the abstraction of matter and form in an
- |2
                      individual physical object is because, for him, this matter and this form
- |2
                      could exist apart from one another, at least by divine power. The same
- |2
                      is true of accident and substance. An accident can be thought without its
- |2
                      substratum because an accident and its substratum are two really
- |2
                      distinct things, and one can exist without the other (Sent. II, q. 5, M; cf. I, d. 30, q. 1, P).
- |2
                  Thus Ockham, as Vignaux observed, adopted the principle, much later
- |2
                      exploited by Hume, that what- ever is
- |2
                      distinguishable is separable. And like Hume, he practically rejected the
- |2
                      distinction of reason. The result was a rejection of the central tenet of
- |2
                      the classi- cal doctrine of abstraction, set
- |2
                      forth by Aristotle and defended, in one form or another, by many of
- |2
                      the scholastics of the twelfth and later centuries.
- "                \n"
- |2
                          Descartes.
- |2
                       There were many elaborations of the Thomistic doctrine among the
- |2
                      later scholastics of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries by Cajetan,
- |2
                      Suarez, John of St. Thomas and others. Suarez in particular, was
- |2
                      responsible for sharpening the differences between abstraction and
- |2
                      distinction (or “separation” as Saint Thomas had
- |2
                      called it). And this, in turn, was almost certainly the immediate source of
- |2
                      Descartes' views.
- |2
                  While Descartes allows that abstraction takes place in the mind, he is
- |2
                      always at pains to notice that abstrac- tion
- |2
                      renders our concepts inadequate in such a way that we cannot discover the
- |2
                      important distinction of things. Thus, the distinction of reason by which
- |2
                      a substance is distinguished from its principal attribute (of thought
- |2
                      or extension as the case may be) is effected by abstracting one from the
- |2
                      other. This is accomplished only with some difficulty and the result does
- |2
                      not corre- spond with anything in the way of
- |2
                      a real separation of a substance from its nature or attribute (Principles of Philosophy, I, 63). Thus the valuable
- |2
                      operation of the mind is that which provides us with a real distinc- tion. This Descartes sometimes calls
- |2
                      “exclusion.” The principal difference which Descartes
- |2
                      makes between abstraction and exclusion is that, in the case of abstrac- tion we consider one thing without
- |2
                      considering that from which abstraction has been made and so may not
- |2
                      be aware that abstraction has rendered a concept in-
- |2
                          adequate, whereas in distinguishing one thing
- |2
                      from another, we must keep both clearly before us. Consid- ering an abstraction by itself prevents us from knowing007
- |2
                       well what it has been abstracted from (Letter to Clerselier, 12
- |2
                      Jan. 1646).
- |2
                  The influence of Descartes on the so-called Port-
- |2
                          Royal Logic of Antoine Arnauld (1612-94) is obvious. But this
- |2
                      famous treatise presents an account of abstrac-
- |2
                          tion which agrees in essential features with the stand- ard medieval view. Arnauld had argued, in his
- |2
                      critique of Descartes, that the genus can be conceived without
- |2
                      conceiving its species so that, for example, one can conceive figure
- |2
                      without conceiving any of the charac-
- |2
                      teristics proper to such a particular figure as a circle
- |2
                      (“Fourth Objections”). Again, length can be conceived
- |2
                      without breadth or depth. But such abstraction, prop-
- |2
                          erly so-called, is only between aspects of things which are only
- |2
                      distinct by a distinction of reason. Where things really distinct are
- |2
                      distinguished, abstraction does not occur (La Logique
- |2
                          ou l'art de penser [1662], Part I, Ch. 5).
- "                \n"
- |2
                          John Locke.
- |2
                       The discussion of abstraction which is perhaps most familiar to
- |2
                      modern readers is to be found in Locke's Essay Concerning
- |2
                          Human Understanding.
- "                \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          Words become general by being made the signs of general ideas; and
- |2
                              ideas become general by separating from them the circumstances of
- |2
                              time and place, and any other ideas that may determine them to this
- |2
                              or that particular existence. By this way of abstraction they are
- |2
                              made capable of repre- senting more
- |2
                              individuals than one; each of which having in it a conformity to
- |2
                              that abstract idea, is (as we call it) of that sort
- "                    \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          (Book III, Ch. 3, para. 6).
- "                    \n"
- "                \n"
- |2
                  He goes on to suggest immediately that nothing new is introduced in this
- |2
                      process but that it is rather a process of omitting all individuating
- |2
                      features, and re- taining only what is common
- |2
                      to all of a set of resem- bling particulars.
- |2
                      This omission, he explains elsewhere (Book II, Ch. 13, para. 13), is a kind
- |2
                      of partial consid- eration which does not
- |2
                      imply a separation. But Locke applies the notion of abstraction to cases
- |2
                      which go beyond the mere omission of particular spatiotemporal
- |2
                      determinations. In the famous example of forming the general idea of a
- |2
                      triangle, Locke says that this idea of triangle in general is
- |2
                      “something imperfect that cannot exist, an idea wherein some
- |2
                      parts of several different and inconsistent ideas are put
- |2
                      together” (Book IV, Ch. 7, para. 9). Whatever Locke may have
- |2
                      thought this “putting together” amounted to, it is
- |2
                      certainly not achieved simply by omitting particularizing features of
- |2
                      several particular triangles. The fact is that no single doctrine of
- |2
                      abstraction can be found in Locke, as I. A. Aaron has shown (Aaron, 1937).
- "                \n"
- |2
                          Berkeley and Hume.
- |2
                       Berkeley's critique of abstrac- tion
- |2
                      proceeds along lines which were relatively new to his readers but which had
- |2
                      already been worked out by Al-Ghazali in the eleventh century and even
- |2
                      by Ockham in the fourteenth century. If two things (in
- |2
                       Berkeley's philosophy, of course, two ideas) can exist
- |2
                      separately, the mind can abstract one from the other. But if it is granted
- |2
                      that two things cannot exist one apart from the other, i.e., that there
- |2
                      would be a con- tradiction if a were supposed to exist without b
- |2
                      (or conversely), the mind cannot think of a without
- |2
                          b or of b without a. To argue otherwise would be to attrib- ute to the human mind a power which not even God
- |2
                      can be supposed to have or exercise.
- |2
                  Hume adopted Berkeley's critique and elaborated a positive theory of the
- |2
                      function of general terms which goes beyond Berkeley. Although every idea
- |2
                      is particu- lar, some ideas can function as
- |2
                      general ones by being associated with a name of a number of
- |2
                      particulars which resemble one another exactly or only approxi- mately. In the latter case, the
- |2
                      name is associated with a number of qualitatively different but
- |2
                      resembling images. One of these associated images will be domi- nant, the others relatively recessive but,
- |2
                      as Hume puts it, “present in power to be recalled by design or
- |2
                          neces- sity.” Thus, although a
- |2
                      red image may be recalled when the word “color” is
- |2
                      pronounced, heard, read, or re- called, other
- |2
                      color-images less strongly associated with the word
- |2
                      “color” tend to appear in consciousness, are
- |2
                      “present in power,” and will be recalled if there is
- |2
                      danger of a mistakenly narrow use of “color” present- ing itself. This then, is Hume's
- |2
                      alternative to the doc- trine that there are
- |2
                      either genuine images or abstract general ideas. The traditional
- |2
                      explanation of the ori- gin of abstract concepts
- |2
                      persisted, with some modi- fications,
- |2
                      among the philosophers of the eighteenth century.
- |2
                  A considerable advance in the understanding of the nature and function of
- |2
                      concepts seems to have been made by Immanuel Kant. The verb, adjective, and
- |2
                      noun frequently occur in Kant's Critique of Pure
- |2
                      Reason (Werke, A54, A70 [B95], A76, A96)
- |2
                      without any special explanation. But Kant's doctrine of pure as well as a posteriori concepts leaves no doubt that
- |2
                      abstraction alone cannot account for the existence or employment of
- |2
                      concepts (Werke, VII, 400-01). “The form of
- |2
                      a concept, as a discursive representation is always con- structed.” As Kant puts it in the Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics (para. 20),
- |2
                      empirical concepts would not be possible unless a pure concept were
- |2
                      added to the particular concept which has been ab-
- |2
                          stracted from intuition. And, finally, in the Critique of Pure Reason, the concept is presented as a rule by means of which the imagination can outline,
- |2
                      for exam- ple, the figure of a certain quadruped
- |2
                      (say, a dog) without limiting it to such a
- |2
                      determinate figure as one's experience or concrete images might present.
- |2
                      Kant calls this a schema. Without such a schema (which is an
- |2
                      application of the pure concepts of the under-008
- "                    \n"
- |2
                      standing) neither images nor a conceptualization of images
- |2
                      would be possible.
- |2
                  Kant's doctrine that pure concepts, i.e., the cate-
- |2
                          gories of the understanding, be at the basis of all con- ceptual thinking thus makes the process of
- |2
                      abstraction subsidiary to and dependent upon faculties which are
- |2
                      logically prior to any process of abstraction from em- pirical data. As more than one writer has recently
- |2
                      pointed out, empirical concepts are more like disposi- tions than like static constituents of
- |2
                      consciousness. There is, however, no suggestion in Kant that abstrac- tion does not occur. That this new
- |2
                      view of the activities of the mind would require an entirely different
- |2
                      account of abstraction is not made very plain in Kant's writings.
- |2
                  In the development of metaphysical Idealism in the post-Kantian
- |2
                      philosophers, the notion of abstraction becomes very general, so general in
- |2
                      fact that the origi- nal meanings of the term
- |2
                      seem almost lost. What makes the matter even more difficult to discuss is
- |2
                      the fact that, among these Idealists, any separation or isolation of
- |2
                      one content or feature of experience or thought from another is condemned
- |2
                      as falsification, so that “to ab-
- |2
                      stract,” “abstract,”
- |2
                      “abstraction,” all acquire a pejora- tive sense. To separate the cognizing subject from
- |2
                      its object, to attend to one discriminable element apart from its
- |2
                      surrounding, and the like, are all condemned as falsifications of reality.
- |2
                      This condemnation rests on the Hegelian doctrine that “the Truth
- |2
                      is the Whole,” i.e., that all aspects of thought and reality are
- |2
                          dialecti- cally interconnected.
- |2
                  Other more significant attacks on the doctrine that general concepts result
- |2
                      from abstraction come from Husserl's thorough critique of Locke and his
- |2
                          eight- eenth-century critics.
- |2
                      While insisting on the absurdity of Locke's doctrine, Husserl attacked with
- |2
                      equal vehe- mence the theories of Berkeley,
- |2
                      Hume, and Mill. He insisted that the general attributes are given to con- sciousness initially, and thus
- |2
                      repudiated the traditional doctrine of abstraction. There are similar views
- |2
                      to be found in some of the writings of Whitehead and San- tayana. The “eternal objects” of
- |2
                      Whitehead and the “essences” of Santayana are
- |2
                      supposed to be discoveries rather than constructions; they are not the
- |2
                      results of creations of mental activities, and thus are not the result
- |2
                      of abstraction as it was traditionally expounded, although the accounts of
- |2
                      abstraction in terms of atten- tion and
- |2
                      comparisons would be consistent with such views.
- |2
                  One of the most significant critiques of abstraction comes from Gottlob
- |2
                      Frege, in his Grundlagen der Arithmetik
- |2
                      (1884). While Frege appears to allow that “color, weight, and
- |2
                      hardness” are abstracted from ob-
- |2
                      jects, he holds that number is not so abstracted.
- |2
                      His theory of the concept of cardinal number makes it
- |2
                       impossible to obtain the number concept by simply omitting
- |2
                      features of empirically accessible objects. Because a number is a
- |2
                      “property” of properties, it is not available from
- |2
                      empirical inspection of individuals. And if we examine Frege's definitions
- |2
                      of particular finite cardinals we see at once why the notion of cardi- nal numbers can hardly be extracted as
- |2
                      traditional abstraction doctrines suggest. The number one, for
- |2
                      example, is a characteristic of any “property F”
- |2
                      which satisfies the following condition: there is that which is F and which is the same as anything which is F, more exactly: (∃x)(Fx(y)(Fy. ⊃. y = x). It is readily seen, if we remove the expression
- |2
                          “F” from the above formula
- |2
                      thus obtaining (∃x). (–x. (y) –y. ∃. y = x, that the property of F is
- |2
                      expressible solely in terms of logical constants. Now because these
- |2
                      constants function in discourse in a manner that is not compara- ble with the way indicative or
- |2
                      descriptive expressions function, it is hardly surprising that there is
- |2
                      nothing available empirically from which they can be ab- stracted or upon which attention may be concentrated.
- |2
                      A psychological account of the origin of the notion of number will
- |2
                      doubtless be a very complicated affair but it will necessarily be radically
- |2
                      different from ab-
- |2
                          straction.
- |2
                  The technique employed by Frege, Georg Cantor, and some others to elucidate
- |2
                      the mathematical notions of cardinal number was recognized by Bertrand
- |2
                      Russell as an application of a general principle which Russell called
- |2
                      “the principle of abstraction.” But he added that it
- |2
                      would have been better called the principle “for the avoidance
- |2
                      of abstraction.” The principle is this: for any relation S which is transitive and symmetrical there is a
- |2
                      relation R which is a many-one relation such that
- |2
                      whenever xSy, there is a unique term z such that xRz and yRz; conversely, if there is a many-one relationR such that there is a unique term z so that xRz andyRz, there is a relation S which
- |2
                      is transitive and sym- metrical (Principia Mathematica, Vol. 1, °72).
- |2
                  The essential principle to notice here is that, instead of attempting to
- |2
                      account for the concept by a psycho-
- |2
                      logical theory by which the concept is derived some- how from the data of the senses or from some innate
- |2
                      or at least internal feature of human consciousness, the concept is
- |2
                      constructed by logical means from fairly simple relational concepts. Thus,
- |2
                      a cardinal number is defined as either a class of those classes whose num- bers can be bi-uniquely correlated (in a one
- |2
                      to one correspondence) with one another, or, as a propertyP of those properties q1, q2,..., qr such that those
- |2
                      things having any one of these properties can be corre- lated bi-uniquely with the things having any other
- |2
                      of these properties.
- |2
                  The formal definition of cardinal number brings into009
- |2
                       prominence the fact that it is constructed by means of
- |2
                      variables ranging over individuals and properties, and by logical
- |2
                      connectives and quantifiers. There is nothing about such a construction
- |2
                      which even suggests that it could have been
- |2
                      “abstracted” (in the traditional sense) from sense
- |2
                      given materials or that there is some “inner” source
- |2
                      of the notion. It can be objected to all this that this logical
- |2
                      construction of concepts of cardi- nal and
- |2
                      ordinal numbers does not explain their psycho-
- |2
                          logical origin. Doubtless this is correct. Frege and Russell
- |2
                      probably both supposed that they were eluci-
- |2
                      dating the nature of mathematical objects which are somehow given
- |2
                      (in some very different way from ab-
- |2
                      straction), whereas they were actually recommending the replacement
- |2
                      of obscure notions by clear ones. But whatever the psychological origin of
- |2
                      mathematical concepts may be, the Frege-Russell construction shows
- |2
                      that it must be far more complex than anything pro-
- |2
                          posed by the traditional abstraction theories. So, while the
- |2
                      psychological question remains a highly interesting one, the focus of
- |2
                      interest has shifted to the logical content of formal concepts.

               Dictionary of the History of IdeasThe term “abstraction” is the

- |2
                      terminology for several processes distinguished in Aristotle's writings by
- |2
                      different terms, viz., aphairesis

                      (χωρισμός)
- |2
                      described in different ways. In all probability, it was Boethius who
- |2
                      introduced the Latin abstractio andabstrahere to translate these Greek nouns and the re- lated verbs.The main theories of concept formation in Greek antiquity were those of
- |2
                      Democritus, Plato, and Aris- totle (Beare,
- |2
                      1906). According to all these theories, sense perception and intellectual
- |2
                      cognition have to be distinguished both by their objects and by their
- |2
                      nature. For Democritus and the Atomists, knowledge as well as sense
- |2
                      perception arises from effluvia of atoms which are continually thrown off
- |2
                      from the surfaces of physical objects, and eventually enter the percipient
- |2
                      through the various sense organs. Intellectual cognition depends on
- |2
                      finer and subtler effluvia. This theory was further developed by the
- |2
                      Epicureans.The difference between sense objects and the objects of intellectual
- |2
                      cognition were also recognized by Plato but accounted for in a very
- |2
                      different way. It is gener- ally assumed that
- |2
                      Plato adopted the Heraclitean view that the physical world is in continuous
- |2
                      flux so that it never exhibits stable objects for sensory cognition.
- |2
                      Because we know, for example, the objects of moral ideals and of
- |2
                      mathematics, it was necessary to assume a nonsensory origin of this
- |2
                      knowledge. Objects of knowledge really are; objects of sense are
- |2
                      perpetually becoming. The objects of intellectual cognition, ac- cordingly, must have been stored up in us
- |2
                      from a previous existence. Knowledge, properly so-called, is
- |2
                      reminiscence.As the Platonic Forms are separate from the physical world of flux, the
- |2
                      knowledge of Forms can only be suggested by the approximations to them that
- |2
                      the physical world is able temporarily to manifest. The theory, which
- |2
                      Plato expressly defended in the Meno (81C), Phaedo (73A), and Phaedrus (247C)
- |2
                      and nowhere expressly abandoned, is that we possess knowledge of the
- |2
                      Forms from a previous existence, and that so-called learning is really
- |2
                      reminiscence. Accordingly, we should not expect to find anything like a
- |2
                      doctrine of abstrac- tion in Plato's
- |2
                      writings. The need for such a doctrine as we find in Aristotle is
- |2
                      occasioned by Aristotle's insistence that the Forms of material things are
- |2
                      not separate realities, yet we seem to be able to consider them
- |2
                      without considering the matter or without con-
- |2
                          sidering other concrete features of material things. Separate
- |2
                      Forms provide us with difficulties but not
- |2
                       with this particular one. Plato's insistence that we are
- |2
                      acquainted with objects that are nowhere completely realized in the
- |2
                      physical world requires a different ac- count of
- |2
                      our knowledge of such objects, and Plato found the theory of reminiscence
- |2
                      the only suitable explanation.But if there is no doctrine of abstraction in Plato's works, there are
- |2
                      passages which might have suggested the doctrine to his successor,
- |2
                      Aristotle. It is sufficient to mention here only the passage in the Phaedrus (249B-C) where it is written that
- |2
                      “man must needs understand the language of Forms, passing from
- |2
                      a plurality of perceptions to a unity gathered together by
- |2
                      reasoning” (Hackforth, 1952). Since, in the very next sentence,
- |2
                      we are informed that “this understanding is the recollection of
- |2
                      those things which our souls beheld aforetime...,” the intention
- |2
                      of the passage is clear enough. But the notion that this unity
- |2
                      (ἕν) is somehow connected with a multitude of
- |2
                      perceptions might have been one of the suggestions which led Aristotle to
- |2
                      his doctrine of abstraction.It was Aristotle's view that form and matter are joined in physical objects
- |2
                      that made a theory of abstrac- tion both
- |2
                      possible and necessary: possible because forms otherwise could not be known
- |2
                      by way of per- ception and necessary because
- |2
                      now perception is the only immediate source of cognition. Aristotle uses

                      the term “abstraction”
- |2
                      (ἀφαίρεσις)
- |2
                      in connection with the objects of mathematics, which
- |2
                      “Platonists” had held were separate from the material
- |2
                      world (Ross, p. 566). Aristotle maintained that these mathematical
- |2
                      features were, in fact, inseparable from material things but could be
- |2
                      thought of separately. In the Metaphysics (1060a
- |2
                      28-1061b 31) the process is described as fol-
- |2
                      lows: in the mathematician's investigations, he takes away
- |2
                      everything that is sensible, e.g., weight and light-
- |2
                          ness, hardness and softness, heat and cold, and all other
- |2
                      sensible contrarieties, and leaves only quantity and continuity in one,
- |2
                      two, or three dimensions, as well as the affections
- |2
                      (πάθη) of these quantities. Elsewhere
- |2
                          (Post. Anal. 81b 3; De
- |2
                      anima 431b 12ff.; Nic. Eth. 1142a; De caelo III, 1, 299a 15) we are repeatedly informed
- |2
                      that the objects of mathematics are treated as separate but cannot exist
- |2
                      separately. It is this for- mulation which
- |2
                      is repeated throughout the subsequent history of abstraction both by those
- |2
                      who follow Aris- totle and by those who reject
- |2
                      his views.A point here is worthy of remark. The authors from Boethius to modern times
- |2
                      speak of abstracting forms (both accidental and mathematical) from
- |2
                      matter, whereas Aristotle (as Owens has pointed out) in de- scribing mathematical abstraction speaks of
- |2
                      taking away the sensible qualities, and leaving only the quan- titative features of physical objects.Although the process of coming to know the univer-
- |2
                      sal from repeated perceptions of particulars is notcalled abstraction—Aristotle here uses
- |2
                      “separation”
- |2
                      (χω̂ρίζειν)—there
- |2
                      is at least one passage which, indi- rectly,
- |2
                      connects these two activities (Post. Anal. 81b 3).
- |2
                      In both these cases, induction
- |2
                      (ἐπαγῶγή)
- |2
                      is associated with the process of coming to know the universal,
- |2
                      whether mathematical or physical. In the case of mathematical abstraction,
- |2
                      it is sometimes indicated that the observed object suggests something which
- |2
                      is not actually presented, but the prevailing impression is that the
- |2
                      mathematical features are literally in the object, and are discovered by
- |2
                      removing from consid- eration all other
- |2
                      sensible qualities.The description of cognition given in De anima
- |2
                      and in the Parva naturalia is important for
- |2
                      the later devel- opment of the doctrine of
- |2
                      abstraction as we find it in medieval writers. The forms of sensible
- |2
                      objects without their matter enter the soul, so that we know objects
- |2
                      by the presence of their forms in consciousness. The form as it exists in
- |2
                      the soul is, presumably, numerically different though specifically the same
- |2
                      as the form in the object of perception (De
- |2
                      anima III; VIII, 431b 26ff.). The forms of objects existing in
- |2
                      the soul are, Aristotle assumes, the fundamental elements of thought
- |2
                      which are the referents of the verbal symbols of spoken discourse (De interpretatione, I, 16a 3ff; cf. De anima III, 6, 430a 26-430b 33). So, in many cases at
- |2
                      any rate, the general terms of discourse stand for isolable objects of
- |2
                      intellectual consideration. There are, how-
- |2
                      ever, exceptions to this, the most important of which are the
- |2
                      analogical or systematically ambiguous terms of metaphysics. Still, the
- |2
                      assumption that verbal terms usually stand for affections of the soul is
- |2
                      one of the important ingredients of the doctrine of abstraction which
- |2
                      was later developed by the medieval philoso-
- |2
                      phers.There are two doctrines of Aristotle which throw some light on his views
- |2
                      about abstraction. One is the contention that human cognition first
- |2
                      comprehends the generic features of physical things and only later
- |2
                      comes to the specific differentiae (Physica I, 1).
- |2
                      The other is the view that the essence of an organism is discovered
- |2
                      regressively by first knowing the activities, then the powers, and by
- |2
                      subsequently discovering the essence on which such powers depend (De anima II). The former doctrine indicates that
- |2
                      there are generic con- cepts. The latter
- |2
                      suggests that the concepts of essences, in the case of those of organisms,
- |2
                      are really no more than conjunctions of powers. But the view that an
- |2
                      essence is an essential unity obviously conflicts with this, because the
- |2
                      coexistence of powers expressed by a conjunction of formulae could not
- |2
                      constitute the sort of unity of essence that Aristotle seemed to have had
- |2
                       in mind. It is, therefore, difficult to understand exactly how
- |2
                      the form of anything comes to exist in the soul as an essential unity.Two main features, then, characterize Aristotle's view of abstraction:
- |2
                      formal aspects of physical reality exist in the soul as separate from
- |2
                      matter even though such a separation is impossible in the physical
- |2
                      world itself. This is true of generic concepts, of mathematical
- |2
                      aspects of things, and, of course, the specific concepts of things.
- |2
                      Cognition occurs when a form exists in the soul.That abstraction need not involve any falsification is insisted upon by the
- |2
                      medievals, and the first state- ment of this
- |2
                      is to be found in Aristotle. The mathe-
- |2
                      matician is concerned with the shape and size of objects such as the
- |2
                      sun or the moon, for example; but he does not consider them as limits of
- |2
                      natural bodies, or with any properties of shape or size insofar as they
- |2
                      are aspects of physical objects. On the other hand, he separates
- |2
                      shape, etc., though without any falsity result-
- |2
                      ing from such conceptual separation (Physica II,
- |2
                      2, 193b 33ff.).The accounts which have come down concerning the theories of
- |2
                      concept-formation of Stoics and Epi- cureans
- |2
                      contain nothing that can properly be described as a theory of abstraction.
- |2
                      Neither of these schools accepted the form-matter distinction; they both
- |2
                          main- tained a materialistic view of
- |2
                      nature, and the Stoics, at least, were nominalists in some sense.For the Stoics, the main function of reason was the grasp of the conclusion
- |2
                      of demonstrations such as the existence of gods and their providential
- |2
                      activity. Gen- eral notions
- |2
                      (νουμένα), they
- |2
                      maintained, are gained by contact or by resemblance; some come from
- |2
                      analogy, still others by composition or contrariety. In another
- |2
                      testimony, general notions are said to arise by way of enlargement or
- |2
                      diminution of what is perceived, or by privation (Diog. Laërt.
- |2
                      VII, 52-53).Epicurus and his school, in addition to their atomistic materialism, held
- |2
                      that we see, for example, shapes, and think of shapes by virtue of the
- |2
                      entrance into the body of something coming from external objects. The efflu- ence of atoms coming from the surfaces of
- |2
                      physical objects enters the sense organs and produces images.
- |2
                      Universal ideas are stored in the mind so that when, for instance, the word
- |2
                      “man” is heard, it calls up the shape stored in the
- |2
                      mind. As all this must reduce to a physical pattern, it is clear that all
- |2
                      notions are ulti- mately derived from
- |2
                      perception by contact, analogy, resemblance, or conjunction. None of this
- |2
                      can be called abstraction.Since Plotinus rejected the Aristotelian theory of sensory cognition, there
- |2
                      is no place for a doctrine of abstraction in his account of our conceptual knowledgeThe commentator, Alexander of Aphrodisias, uses the phrase
- |2
                      ἐξ
- |2
                      ἀφαιρέσεως
- |2
                      in describing the process of ob- taining any
- |2
                      form in consciousness as separated from the material which it determines in
- |2
                      the external world, and it is from this source (Alexander, De anima, pp. 107, 34) that Boethius derived his
- |2
                      account of abstraction (In Isagogen Porphyrii
- |2
                      commenta I, 11).According to Boethius, there are many things which cannot actually be
- |2
                      separated but which are separated by the soul and by
- |2
                      thought—e.g., no one can actually separate a triangle from its
- |2
                      material substratum, but a person can mentally separate the triangle and
- |2
                      its properties from matter, and contemplate it. This sepa- ration does not involve any falsification because falsifi- cation can only occur when
- |2
                      something is asserted to exist separately which does not or cannot exist
- |2
                          sepa- rately. Thus the separation
- |2
                      achieved by abstraction is not only not false, but is indispensable to the
- |2
                      discovery of truth. This means, we propose, that abstraction provides
- |2
                      the concepts which are to be united in affirm-
- |2
                          ative propositions which truly state what charac- teristics things possess.This account of abstraction follows along lines al-
- |2
                          ready laid down by Aristotle and is repeated, with elaborations,
- |2
                      by the logicians of the twelfth century. Thus Abelard tells us that,
- |2
                      although matter and form are always together, the mind can consider each
- |2
                          sepa- rately. Thus abstraction does not
- |2
                      falsify because there is no assertion that anything has just the
- |2
                      abstracted property and no others. The mind considers only one feature
- |2
                      but does not assert its separation in fact from other features.
- |2
                      “For the thing does not have only it, but the thing is
- |2
                      considered only as having it” (Logica
- |2
                          ingredientibus). John of Salisbury provides a similar
- |2
                      account. In abstracting a line or surface, the abstracting intellect does
- |2
                      not conceive it as existing apart from matter. Abstraction is simply a
- |2
                      contemplation of form without considering its matter even though the
- |2
                      form cannot exist without the matter (Metalogicon
- |2
                      II, Ch. 20). Again, some things resemble others and the mind abstracts
- |2
                      from these particular individuals and con
- |2
                      siders only the resemblance. In this way, the concept of
- |2
                      “man” is abstracted from the perceptions of individ- uals, and the concept of
- |2
                      “animal” from man, horse, etc. (ibid.).Similar views about abstraction are developed by the anonymous author of
- |2
                          De intellectibus (cf. V. Cousin, 1859)
- |2
                      and it is clear that this general agreement can be accounted for by the
- |2
                      fact that all the schoolmen of this period read Boethius, and, perhaps,
- |2
                      also by the influence of Abelard.The Arabic translations of Aristotle and some of his earlier Greek
- |2
                      commentators made the doctrine of ab-
- |2
                      straction available to the Islamic and Jewish philoso- phers. But there were also translations or epitomes
- |2
                      of the writings of Plotinus and Proclus and, even when there was no
- |2
                      confusion between Neo-Platonic and Aristotelian views, attempts were made
- |2
                      to harmonize Aristotelian and Neo-Platonic doctrine. In particular,
- |2
                      the Neo-Platonic system of emanations was grafted onto that doctrine of
- |2
                      Aristotle which concerned the connection of the Agent Intellect to
- |2
                      individual human cognitive activities. The Active Intellect in
- |2
                      Aristotle's psychology was identified with the last Intelligence. In
- |2
                      some of these systems, the illuminative activity of the active intellect
- |2
                      consists in the radiation of forms into the material world and into the
- |2
                      human mind. Attempts to combine this doctrine with the doctrine of
- |2
                      abstraction produced strange consequences. In Avicenna's (Ibn Sina,
- |2
                      980-1037) treatises on psychol- ogy, for
- |2
                      example, there are various degrees of abstrac-
- |2
                      tion of forms which correspond to the ascending se- quence of cognitive powers, the sensitive, the
- |2
                      imaginative, the estimative, and finally the intellective. His account of
- |2
                      abstraction of sensible forms seems to conform to the Aristotelian
- |2
                      psychology of taking the form of a material object apart from the
- |2
                      matter (Avicenna, Psychology, p. 40). But forms
- |2
                      which have no embodiment or which are embodied accidentally must be
- |2
                      received from the Agent Intellect when the individual human souls have been
- |2
                      prepared by the appropriate sense experience to receive these emana- tions (Avicenna, De
- |2
                          anima 5; cf. Al-Ghazali, Meta- physics, pp. 174ff.). This explanation of how we
- |2
                      know the nature of qualities and of things thus combines a theory of
- |2
                      abstraction properly so-called with a doctrine which accounts for
- |2
                      conceptual knowledge by emana- tions of forms
- |2
                      from a suprahuman source. This made it congenial to many of the earlier
- |2
                      scholastics of the thirteenth century.Another feature of Avicenna's views must be men-
- |2
                          tioned: the doctrine of distinctions. This became im- portant for the scholastics of the
- |2
                      thirteenth and four- teenth centuries, and
- |2
                      figures in the discussions of the seventeenth century. One of the important
- |2
                      sources isYet another aspect of Avicenna's thought, important to the history of
- |2
                      abstraction, is his doctrine of the common nature. Although Avicenna
- |2
                      vehemently denies that universals have any extra-mental existence and
- |2
                      although he asseverates that individuals alone exist, he maintains that a
- |2
                      nature can be contemplated which, in itself, is neither one nor many
- |2
                      (numerically) but is simply the nature that it intrinsically is: horseness
- |2
                      is simply horseness. This theory of natures was to be used by the
- |2
                      thirteenth-century scholastics in diverse ways. Aquinas draws upon it to
- |2
                      avoid the Platonic paradox about the one and the many in his De ente et essentia, and it is essential to the
- |2
                      views of Duns Scotus. Accord- ing to the
- |2
                      latter, the common nature has a unity less than numerical unity so that the
- |2
                      paradox of one nature or form in many individuals is again avoided. And
- |2
                      it continues to receive support in the fourteenth century in the
- |2
                      critique of Ockham by Richard of Campsall:Illa natura... non est pleures nec una (Logica, Ch. 15).This theory that a nature as such is neither one nor many is essential to
- |2
                      Scotus' doctrine of abstraction. For although such a nature cannot be
- |2
                      separated, even by divine power, from the individual differences by
- |2
                      which each thing is individuated, it can nonetheless be con- sidered apart from such individuating
- |2
                      features by ab- straction.Al-Ghazali (1058-1111) criticized Avicenna's view of abstraction along lines
- |2
                      which immediately call to mind similar criticisms made later by some fourteenth- century nominalists
- |2
                      (especially Ockham) and by some of the nominalists of the seventeenth and
- |2
                      eighteenth centuries (especially Hobbes and Berkeley). Against the
- |2
                      view that the intelligible universal in the intellect is divested of all
- |2
                      specifying or individuating determi-
- |2
                      nations, Al-Ghazali urges that everything in the intel- lect is derived from the senses and retains all the
- |2
                          con- crete determinateness of sense
- |2
                      experience. True, the intellect can separate parts of a composite, but
- |2
                      each part thus separated is just as individual as was the aggregate
- |2
                      from which it was separated. Each wholly
- |2
                       determinate part of an aggregate thus separated func- tions as a universal insofar as it is
- |2
                      conceived as standing in a relation to all similar individuals, and serves
- |2
                      as an image for all other things similar to it (Tahafut..., 1958; cf. Averroës, Tahafut, 1954). Al-Ghazali may, therefore, be regarded as a precursor
- |2
                      of the sort of criticism of abstraction which later nominalists in
- |2
                      Christendom were to exploit. There is, of course, no likelihood of any
- |2
                      literary influence because this part of Al-Ghazali was not accessible in
- |2
                      Latin until the sixteenth century (Zedler, 1961). Moreover,
- |2
                      Averroës opposed Al-Ghazali on this point and continued to
- |2
                      uphold the Aristotelian doctrine. We find that Mai-
- |2
                          monides (1135-1204) also adheres to a doctrine of abstraction
- |2
                      derived mostly from Avicenna's Guide of the
- |2
                      Perplexed.In the philosophical writings of the early thirteenth century in Christendom
- |2
                      attempts were made to ac- commodate the
- |2
                      views of Aristotle to those of Saint Augustine. Avicenna's writings on
- |2
                      psychology made this accommodation feasible especially to the Fran- ciscans. But we should glance at one of
- |2
                      the first at- tempts in this vein by Robert
- |2
                      Grosseteste.In his commentary on the Posterior Analytics,
- |2
                      Gros- seteste taught that the mind is
- |2
                      capable of knowledge without the aid of the senses. Due to its
- |2
                      incarceration in the body, however, the mind is darkened and re- quires the aid of sensation. Accordingly,
- |2
                      abstraction of forms from the data of sensation is normally re- quired. So the intellect separates out for
- |2
                      special con- sideration the features of
- |2
                      things which are confused in sensation. Abstraction of forms usually is
- |2
                      derived from many individual objects presented to the senses. But the
- |2
                      knowledge thus attained is not of the highest grade.A representative view of the Franciscans can be found in Matthew of
- |2
                      Aquasparta. Because the human soul is a sort of mean between God and
- |2
                      creatures, it has two aspects, one of which, the superior part, is
- |2
                      turned to God; the other, the inferior part, is turned toward creatures.
- |2
                      According to the doctrine of “the two faces of the
- |2
                      soul,” the correct explanation of human knowledge is a medium
- |2
                      between the position of Augustine and Aristotle.Knowledge of the world is generated in man by sensation, memory, and
- |2
                      experience from which the universal concepts of art and science are
- |2
                      derived. But in order fully to understand the natures of things thus
- |2
                      abstracted from sensation we require an illumination from the Divine Light.
- |2
                      Although we do not see Divine Light in our earthly existence, we see the
- |2
                      natures of things by its means. The existence of this illumination is
- |2
                      explained as follows: we know eternal truths with certainty. These truths
- |2
                      are immutable yet everythingMatthew adopts the Augustinian theory that the corporeal world cannot
- |2
                      produce changes in the soul (the inferior cannot affect the superior).
- |2
                      Rather the soul is actively aware of changes occurring anywhere in the
- |2
                      body. The data which the soul makes from its notice of corporeal changes
- |2
                      are rendered intelligible by the Agent Intellect which, Matthew says, is
- |2
                      what Aristotle calls abstractions. But these
- |2
                      abstractions are understood in the light of the immutable rules
- |2
                      provided by divine illumination. This combination of “abstrac- tion” and illumination is
- |2
                      to be found in a number of Franciscan thinkers of the thirteenth century.
- |2
                          Saint Thomas Aquinas.
- |2
                       Aquinas expounds a theory of abstraction according to which things
- |2
                      (in the sense of objects of apprehension) can be considered, one
- |2
                      aspect apart from another, in cases in which the two things cannot exist
- |2
                      separated from one another. In cases in which one thing can exist apart
- |2
                      from another we should speak of “separation” rather
- |2
                      than abstraction (Commentary on Boethius' De
- |2
                      Trinitate, Q5, a.3). Since substance, which is the intelligible matter
- |2
                      of quantity, can exist without quantity, it is possible to consider
- |2
                      substance without quantity. Again, to consider “ani- mal” without considering
- |2
                      “stone” is not to abstractanimal from stone. Thus it is only
- |2
                      in cases where things cannot exist separately but can be considered separately that we can properly speak of abstraction.Abstraction is of two kinds: the one, mathematical abstraction, involves a
- |2
                      consideration of form from sen- sible matter.
- |2
                      The other is the abstraction of the univer-
- |2
                      sal from the particular. The possibility of abstraction depends on
- |2
                      the fact that things (features of things) exist in one way in the realm of
- |2
                      matter, but in another in an intellect which apprehends them. Thus, because
- |2
                      the mind is immaterial, the natures of material things exist in the
- |2
                      mind in a way suitable to the mind, i.e., they have an immaterial existence
- |2
                      in the mind. But the simple apprehension of the mind does not involve
- |2
                      any assertion that the features of things exist thus in reality,
- |2
                      because simple apprehension is not an act which asserts or denies anything
- |2
                      at all. The mathematical abstraction which considers only the quantitative
- |2
                      features of phys- ical things does not assert
- |2
                      that lines, planes, etc., exist independently of such objects. It merely
- |2
                      considers these features without attending to other aspects of
- |2
                      physical objects, although the mathematical or quantitative features
- |2
                      cannot exist isolated from physical objects.In the case of the abstraction of the universal from particulars, the mind
- |2
                      considers the specific nature of, say, man or dog, apart from the
- |2
                      individuating aspects
- |2
                       of individual men or dogs. Again, abstrahentium
- |2
                          non est mendacium (“abstraction is not
- |2
                      falsification”) be- cause the mind
- |2
                      does not assert that the specific nature of man can exist apart from
- |2
                      particular men.The generic nature common to several species can be abstracted so that the
- |2
                      mind thinks only of the generic aspect of these several species and ignores
- |2
                      the specific differences. “What is joined in reality, the
- |2
                      intellect can at times receive separately, when one of the elements is not
- |2
                      included in the notion of the other” (Summa
- |2
                          contra gentiles I, c. 54, para. 3). So, because the concept
- |2
                      of the genus “animal” does not explicitly contain the
- |2
                      concept of, say, “rational,” the mind can consider
- |2
                      “animal” without considering any particular kind of
- |2
                      animal. But this “animal” is not something existing
- |2
                      apart from particular kinds of animal any more than these particular kinds
- |2
                      can exist apart from indi- vidual animals.
- |2
                      Only in the mind that apprehends the form of animal stripped of its
- |2
                      individuating and speci- fying
- |2
                      characteristics does animal as such exist (ibid., I, c. 26, para. 5).Nothing exists in a genus which does not exist in some species of that genus
- |2
                      (ibid., I, c. 25, para. 2).Animal cannot exist in re without
- |2
                      the differentia “ra-
- |2
                      tional” or the differentia “irrational.”
- |2
                      Still animal can be considered without these differentiae (ibid., I, c.
- |2
                      26, para. 11). There is, however, no purely generic ex- emplar in the divine mind (Summa
- |2
                      theol. I, 15a. 3 ad 4).Duns Scotus adopted from Avicenna the doctrine of a common nature which is
- |2
                      in itself neither one nor many but simply what is indicated in the
- |2
                      definition or description of such a nature. This nature can be
- |2
                      individuated in the individuals of a species by the further determination
- |2
                      of an individual difference or “haecceity” (i.e.,
- |2
                      “thisness” in contrast to
- |2
                      “quiddity” or “whatness”), or
- |2
                      it can be rendered a universal con- cept by the
- |2
                      action of the active intellect; but in itself it is neither one nor many.The process of abstracting a universal concept from the common nature so
- |2
                      conceived is not a “real action” because the common
- |2
                      nature is already present in the individuals and formally distinguished
- |2
                      from the indi- vidual differences prior to
- |2
                      and independent of any action of the intellect (Duns Scotus, Quaestiones in metaphyisicorum libros, VII, q. 18;
- |2
                          Opus oxoniense II d. 1, q. 5 [q. 6], n. 5). This
- |2
                      formal distinction of the specific nature from the individual differences
- |2
                      which contract it to a numerical unity in the various individ- uals of the species applies just as
- |2
                      well to the distinction between the specific and the generic features of
- |2
                      a common nature, for these also are formally distinct in such a way
- |2
                      that the mind can think of the generic nature as such. There is, therefore,
- |2
                      no distortion or falsification in the result of abstraction, because abstrac-Thus, the distinctive feature of Scotus' contribution to the doctrine of
- |2
                      abstraction depends upon his doc- trine of the
- |2
                      formal distinction between the individu-
- |2
                      ating and the common nature which exists prior to any action of mind
- |2
                      on the data of observation.
- |2
                          William of Ockham.
- |2
                       Ockham uses the term “abstrac-
- |2
                          tion” and provides a number of meanings for it, but
- |2
                      he departs from his predecessors on one very important point: he denies
- |2
                      that we can think as separate what is incapable of existing separately in
- |2
                      reality. However, he allows that we can understand one thing without
- |2
                      understanding another at the same time even though the two things do, in
- |2
                      fact, coexist. Thus he states “To abstract is to understand one
- |2
                      thing without under- standing another at
- |2
                      the same time even though in reality the one is not separated from the
- |2
                      other, e.g., sometimes the intellect understands the whiteness which
- |2
                      is in milk and does not understand the sweetness of milk. Abstraction in
- |2
                      this sense can belong even to a sense, for a sense can apprehend one
- |2
                      sensible without apprehending another” (Expositio physicorum, fol. 111c).In his commentary on the Sentences (II, qq. 14, 15
- |2
                      xx) Ockham tells us that the abstraction of the agent intellect is twofold.
- |2
                      On the one hand, it produces a thought (an intellection) which is either
- |2
                      intuitive or abstractive, is wholly abstracted from matter because it
- |2
                      is immaterial in itself, and has its existence in some- thing immaterial (i.e., in the soul). On the other
- |2
                      hand, the abstraction produces a universal, i.e., a universal concept
- |2
                      of a thing in representative existence.In still another sense, abstraction occurs when one predicable is predicated
- |2
                      of a subject and another pre- dicable is not
- |2
                      predicable of that subject even though the latter predicable applies to the
- |2
                      subject. This takes place in mathematics. For the mathematician
- |2
                      considers only such statements as “Every body is divisible, is
- |2
                      so long and so deep,” and ignores statements about bodies
- |2
                      which pertain to motion, to the composition of matter and form in physical
- |2
                      things, etc.Accordingly, Ockham allows that many things are really distinct which
- |2
                      constitute a unity, as in the case of matter and form, or substance and
- |2
                      accident. Now it is true that, in such cases, the mind can separate or
- |2
                      divide these from one another so as to understand one and not understand
- |2
                      the other. But if a and b are
- |2
                      one thing and a may not be really distinguished fromb, it is impossible that the mind may divide a fromb so as to understand either without understanding
- |2
                      the other (Sent. I, d. 2, q. 3, H).Hence, Ockham rejects any abstraction of a common
- |2
                       nature or form from its instances in such a way that the mind
- |2
                      can contemplate the common nature as such. The only distinction Ockham will
- |2
                      allow is the real distinction of one thing from another thing. A distinc- tion between the common nature and an
- |2
                      individual difference which Scotus had defended is, for Ockham,
- |2
                      entirely out of the question (Sent. I d, qq. 1-4).The reason why Ockham can allow the abstraction of matter and form in an
- |2
                      individual physical object is because, for him, this matter and this form
- |2
                      could exist apart from one another, at least by divine power. The same
- |2
                      is true of accident and substance. An accident can be thought without its
- |2
                      substratum because an accident and its substratum are two really
- |2
                      distinct things, and one can exist without the other (Sent. II, q. 5, M; cf. I, d. 30, q. 1, P).Thus Ockham, as Vignaux observed, adopted the principle, much later
- |2
                      exploited by Hume, that what- ever is
- |2
                      distinguishable is separable. And like Hume, he practically rejected the
- |2
                      distinction of reason. The result was a rejection of the central tenet of
- |2
                      the classi- cal doctrine of abstraction, set
- |2
                      forth by Aristotle and defended, in one form or another, by many of
- |2

                          Descartes.
- |2
                       There were many elaborations of the Thomistic doctrine among the
- |2
                      later scholastics of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries by Cajetan,
- |2
                      Suarez, John of St. Thomas and others. Suarez in particular, was
- |2
                      responsible for sharpening the differences between abstraction and
- |2
                      distinction (or “separation” as Saint Thomas had
- |2
                      called it). And this, in turn, was almost certainly the immediate source of
- |2
                      Descartes' views.While Descartes allows that abstraction takes place in the mind, he is
- |2
                      always at pains to notice that abstrac- tion
- |2
                      renders our concepts inadequate in such a way that we cannot discover the
- |2
                      important distinction of things. Thus, the distinction of reason by which
- |2
                      a substance is distinguished from its principal attribute (of thought
- |2
                      or extension as the case may be) is effected by abstracting one from the
- |2
                      other. This is accomplished only with some difficulty and the result does
- |2
                      not corre- spond with anything in the way of
- |2
                      a real separation of a substance from its nature or attribute (Principles of Philosophy, I, 63). Thus the valuable
- |2
                      operation of the mind is that which provides us with a real distinc- tion. This Descartes sometimes calls
- |2
                      “exclusion.” The principal difference which Descartes
- |2
                      makes between abstraction and exclusion is that, in the case of abstrac- tion we consider one thing without
- |2
                      considering that from which abstraction has been made and so may not
- |2
                      be aware that abstraction has rendered a concept in-
- |2
                          adequate, whereas in distinguishing one thing
- |2
                      from another, we must keep both clearly before us. Consid- ering an abstraction by itself prevents us from knowingThe influence of Descartes on the so-called Port-
- |2
                          Royal Logic of Antoine Arnauld (1612-94) is obvious. But this
- |2
                      famous treatise presents an account of abstrac-
- |2
                          tion which agrees in essential features with the stand- ard medieval view. Arnauld had argued, in his
- |2
                      critique of Descartes, that the genus can be conceived without
- |2
                      conceiving its species so that, for example, one can conceive figure
- |2
                      without conceiving any of the charac-
- |2
                      teristics proper to such a particular figure as a circle
- |2
                      (“Fourth Objections”). Again, length can be conceived
- |2
                      without breadth or depth. But such abstraction, prop-
- |2
                          erly so-called, is only between aspects of things which are only
- |2
                      distinct by a distinction of reason. Where things really distinct are
- |2
                      distinguished, abstraction does not occur (La Logique
- |2
                          ou l'art de penser [1662], Part I, Ch. 5).
- |2
                          John Locke.
- |2
                       The discussion of abstraction which is perhaps most familiar to
- |2
                      modern readers is to be found in Locke's Essay Concerning
- |2
                          Human Understanding.Words become general by being made the signs of general ideas; and
- |2
                              ideas become general by separating from them the circumstances of
- |2
                              time and place, and any other ideas that may determine them to this
- |2
                              or that particular existence. By this way of abstraction they are
- |2
                              made capable of repre- senting more
- |2
                              individuals than one; each of which having in it a conformity to
- |2
                              that abstract idea, is (as we call it) of that sort
- |2
                          (Book III, Ch. 3, para. 6).
- |2
                      He goes on to suggest immediately that nothing new is introduced in this
- |2
                      process but that it is rather a process of omitting all individuating
- |2
                      features, and re- taining only what is common
- |2
                      to all of a set of resem- bling particulars.
- |2
                      This omission, he explains elsewhere (Book II, Ch. 13, para. 13), is a kind
- |2
                      of partial consid- eration which does not
- |2
                      imply a separation. But Locke applies the notion of abstraction to cases
- |2
                      which go beyond the mere omission of particular spatiotemporal
- |2
                      determinations. In the famous example of forming the general idea of a
- |2
                      triangle, Locke says that this idea of triangle in general is
- |2
                      “something imperfect that cannot exist, an idea wherein some
- |2
                      parts of several different and inconsistent ideas are put
- |2
                      together” (Book IV, Ch. 7, para. 9). Whatever Locke may have
- |2
                      thought this “putting together” amounted to, it is
- |2
                      certainly not achieved simply by omitting particularizing features of
- |2
                      several particular triangles. The fact is that no single doctrine of
- |2
                      abstraction can be found in Locke, as I. A. Aaron has shown (Aaron, 1937).
- |2
                          Berkeley and Hume.
- |2
                       Berkeley's critique of abstrac- tion
- |2
                      proceeds along lines which were relatively new to his readers but which had
- |2
                      already been worked out by Al-Ghazali in the eleventh century and even
- |2
                      by Ockham in the fourteenth century. If two things (in
- |2
                       Berkeley's philosophy, of course, two ideas) can exist
- |2
                      separately, the mind can abstract one from the other. But if it is granted
- |2
                      that two things cannot exist one apart from the other, i.e., that there
- |2
                      would be a con- tradiction if a were supposed to exist without b
- |2
                      (or conversely), the mind cannot think of a without
- |2
                          b or of b without a. To argue otherwise would be to attrib- ute to the human mind a power which not even God
- |2
                      can be supposed to have or exercise.Hume adopted Berkeley's critique and elaborated a positive theory of the
- |2
                      function of general terms which goes beyond Berkeley. Although every idea
- |2
                      is particu- lar, some ideas can function as
- |2
                      general ones by being associated with a name of a number of
- |2
                      particulars which resemble one another exactly or only approxi- mately. In the latter case, the
- |2
                      name is associated with a number of qualitatively different but
- |2
                      resembling images. One of these associated images will be domi- nant, the others relatively recessive but,
- |2
                      as Hume puts it, “present in power to be recalled by design or
- |2
                          neces- sity.” Thus, although a
- |2
                      red image may be recalled when the word “color” is
- |2
                      pronounced, heard, read, or re- called, other
- |2
                      color-images less strongly associated with the word
- |2
                      “color” tend to appear in consciousness, are
- |2
                      “present in power,” and will be recalled if there is
- |2
                      danger of a mistakenly narrow use of “color” present- ing itself. This then, is Hume's
- |2
                      alternative to the doc- trine that there are
- |2
                      either genuine images or abstract general ideas. The traditional
- |2
                      explanation of the ori- gin of abstract concepts
- |2
                      persisted, with some modi- fications,
- |2
                      among the philosophers of the eighteenth century.A considerable advance in the understanding of the nature and function of
- |2
                      concepts seems to have been made by Immanuel Kant. The verb, adjective, and
- |2
                      noun frequently occur in Kant's Critique of Pure
- |2
                      Reason (Werke, A54, A70 [B95], A76, A96)
- |2
                      without any special explanation. But Kant's doctrine of pure as well as a posteriori concepts leaves no doubt that
- |2
                      abstraction alone cannot account for the existence or employment of
- |2
                      concepts (Werke, VII, 400-01). “The form of
- |2
                      a concept, as a discursive representation is always con- structed.” As Kant puts it in the Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics (para. 20),
- |2
                      empirical concepts would not be possible unless a pure concept were
- |2
                      added to the particular concept which has been ab-
- |2
                          stracted from intuition. And, finally, in the Critique of Pure Reason, the concept is presented as a rule by means of which the imagination can outline,
- |2
                      for exam- ple, the figure of a certain quadruped
- |2
                      (say, a dog) without limiting it to such a
- |2
                      determinate figure as one's experience or concrete images might present.
- |2
                      Kant calls this a schema. Without such a schema (which is an
- |2
                      application of the pure concepts of the under-Kant's doctrine that pure concepts, i.e., the cate-
- |2
                          gories of the understanding, be at the basis of all con- ceptual thinking thus makes the process of
- |2
                      abstraction subsidiary to and dependent upon faculties which are
- |2
                      logically prior to any process of abstraction from em- pirical data. As more than one writer has recently
- |2
                      pointed out, empirical concepts are more like disposi- tions than like static constituents of
- |2
                      consciousness. There is, however, no suggestion in Kant that abstrac- tion does not occur. That this new
- |2
                      view of the activities of the mind would require an entirely different
- |2
                      account of abstraction is not made very plain in Kant's writings.In the development of metaphysical Idealism in the post-Kantian
- |2
                      philosophers, the notion of abstraction becomes very general, so general in
- |2
                      fact that the origi- nal meanings of the term
- |2
                      seem almost lost. What makes the matter even more difficult to discuss is
- |2
                      the fact that, among these Idealists, any separation or isolation of
- |2
                      one content or feature of experience or thought from another is condemned
- |2
                      as falsification, so that “to ab-
- |2
                      stract,” “abstract,”
- |2
                      “abstraction,” all acquire a pejora- tive sense. To separate the cognizing subject from
- |2
                      its object, to attend to one discriminable element apart from its
- |2
                      surrounding, and the like, are all condemned as falsifications of reality.
- |2
                      This condemnation rests on the Hegelian doctrine that “the Truth
- |2
                      is the Whole,” i.e., that all aspects of thought and reality are
- |2
                          dialecti- cally interconnected.Other more significant attacks on the doctrine that general concepts result
- |2
                      from abstraction come from Husserl's thorough critique of Locke and his
- |2
                          eight- eenth-century critics.
- |2
                      While insisting on the absurdity of Locke's doctrine, Husserl attacked with
- |2
                      equal vehe- mence the theories of Berkeley,
- |2
                      Hume, and Mill. He insisted that the general attributes are given to con- sciousness initially, and thus
- |2
                      repudiated the traditional doctrine of abstraction. There are similar views
- |2
                      to be found in some of the writings of Whitehead and San- tayana. The “eternal objects” of
- |2
                      Whitehead and the “essences” of Santayana are
- |2
                      supposed to be discoveries rather than constructions; they are not the
- |2
                      results of creations of mental activities, and thus are not the result
- |2
                      of abstraction as it was traditionally expounded, although the accounts of
- |2
                      abstraction in terms of atten- tion and
- |2
                      comparisons would be consistent with such views.One of the most significant critiques of abstraction comes from Gottlob
- |2
                      Frege, in his Grundlagen der Arithmetik
- |2
                      (1884). While Frege appears to allow that “color, weight, and
- |2
                      hardness” are abstracted from ob-
- |2
                      jects, he holds that number is not so abstracted.
- |2
                      His theory of the concept of cardinal number makes it
- |2
                       impossible to obtain the number concept by simply omitting
- |2
                      features of empirically accessible objects. Because a number is a
- |2
                      “property” of properties, it is not available from
- |2
                      empirical inspection of individuals. And if we examine Frege's definitions
- |2
                      of particular finite cardinals we see at once why the notion of cardi- nal numbers can hardly be extracted as
- |2
                      traditional abstraction doctrines suggest. The number one, for
- |2
                      example, is a characteristic of any “property F”
- |2
                      which satisfies the following condition: there is that which is F and which is the same as anything which is F, more exactly: (∃x)(Fx(y)(Fy. ⊃. y = x). It is readily seen, if we remove the expression
- |2
                          “F” from the above formula
- |2
                      thus obtaining (∃x). (–x. (y) –y. ∃. y = x, that the property of F is
- |2
                      expressible solely in terms of logical constants. Now because these
- |2
                      constants function in discourse in a manner that is not compara- ble with the way indicative or
- |2
                      descriptive expressions function, it is hardly surprising that there is
- |2
                      nothing available empirically from which they can be ab- stracted or upon which attention may be concentrated.
- |2
                      A psychological account of the origin of the notion of number will
- |2
                      doubtless be a very complicated affair but it will necessarily be radically
- |2
                      different from ab-
- |2
                          straction.The technique employed by Frege, Georg Cantor, and some others to elucidate
- |2
                      the mathematical notions of cardinal number was recognized by Bertrand
- |2
                      Russell as an application of a general principle which Russell called
- |2
                      “the principle of abstraction.” But he added that it
- |2
                      would have been better called the principle “for the avoidance
- |2
                      of abstraction.” The principle is this: for any relation S which is transitive and symmetrical there is a
- |2
                      relation R which is a many-one relation such that
- |2
                      whenever xSy, there is a unique term z such that xRz and yRz; conversely, if there is a many-one relationR such that there is a unique term z so that xRz andyRz, there is a relation S which
- |2
                      is transitive and sym- metrical (Principia Mathematica, Vol. 1, °72).The essential principle to notice here is that, instead of attempting to
- |2
                      account for the concept by a psycho-
- |2
                      logical theory by which the concept is derived some- how from the data of the senses or from some innate
- |2
                      or at least internal feature of human consciousness, the concept is
- |2
                      constructed by logical means from fairly simple relational concepts. Thus,
- |2
                      a cardinal number is defined as either a class of those classes whose num- bers can be bi-uniquely correlated (in a one
- |2
                      to one correspondence) with one another, or, as a propertyP of those properties q1, q2,..., qr such that those
- |2
                      things having any one of these properties can be corre- lated bi-uniquely with the things having any other
- |2
                      of these properties.The formal definition of cardinal number brings intoFor main developments in Greek thought, see J. I. Beare,Greek Theories of Elementary Cognition (Oxford,

  verbs.\n                The main theories of concept formation in Greek antiquity
  were those of\n                    Democritus, Plato, and Aris- totle (Beare,\n
  \                   1906). According to all these theories, sense perception and
  intellectual\n                    cognition have to be distinguished both by their
  objects and by their\n                    nature. For Democritus and the Atomists,
  knowledge as well as sense\n                    perception arises from effluvia
  of atoms which are continually thrown off\n                    from the surfaces
  of physical objects, and eventually enter the percipient\n                    through
  the various sense organs. Intellectual cognition depends on\n                    finer
  and subtler effluvia. This theory was further developed by the\n                    Epicureans.\n
  \               The difference between sense objects and the objects of intellectual\n
  \                   cognition were also recognized by Plato but accounted for in
  a very\n                    different way. It is gener- ally assumed that\n                    Plato
  adopted the Heraclitean view that the physical world is in continuous\n                    flux
  so that it never exhibits stable objects for sensory cognition.\n                    Because
  we know, for example, the objects of moral ideals and of\n                    mathematics,
  it was necessary to assume a nonsensory origin of this\n                    knowledge.
  Objects of knowledge really are; objects of sense are\n                    perpetually
  becoming. The objects of intellectual cognition, ac- cordingly, must have been stored
  up in us\n                    from a previous existence. Knowledge, properly so-called,
  is\n                    reminiscence.\n                As the Platonic Forms are
  separate from the physical world of flux, the\n                    knowledge of
  Forms can only be suggested by the approximations to them that\n                    the
  physical world is able temporarily to manifest. The theory, which\n                    Plato
  expressly defended in the Meno (81C), Phaedo (73A), and Phaedrus (247C)\n                    and
  nowhere expressly abandoned, is that we possess knowledge of the\n                    Forms
  from a previous existence, and that so-called learning is really\n                    reminiscence.
  Accordingly, we should not expect to find anything like a\n                    doctrine
  of abstrac- tion in Plato's\n                    writings. The need for such a doctrine
  as we find in Aristotle is\n                    occasioned by Aristotle's insistence
  that the Forms of material things are\n                    not separate realities,
  yet we seem to be able to consider them\n                    without considering
  the matter or without con-\n                        sidering other concrete features
  of material things. Separate\n                    Forms provide us with difficulties
  but not\n                     with this particular one. Plato's insistence that
  we are\n                    acquainted with objects that are nowhere completely
  realized in the\n                    physical world requires a different ac- count
  of\n                    our knowledge of such objects, and Plato found the theory
  of reminiscence\n                    the only suitable explanation.\n                But
  if there is no doctrine of abstraction in Plato's works, there are\n                    passages
  which might have suggested the doctrine to his successor,\n                    Aristotle.
  It is sufficient to mention here only the passage in the Phaedrus (249B-C) where
  it is written that\n                    “man must needs understand the language
  of Forms, passing from\n                    a plurality of perceptions to a unity
  gathered together by\n                    reasoning” (Hackforth, 1952). Since, in
  the very next sentence,\n                    we are informed that “this understanding
  is the recollection of\n                    those things which our souls beheld
  aforetime...,” the intention\n                    of the passage is clear enough.
  But the notion that this unity\n                    (ἕν) is somehow connected with
  a multitude of\n                    perceptions might have been one of the suggestions
  which led Aristotle to\n                    his doctrine of abstraction.\n                It
  was Aristotle's view that form and matter are joined in physical objects\n                    that
  made a theory of abstrac- tion both\n                    possible and necessary:
  possible because forms otherwise could not be known\n                    by way
  of per- ception and necessary because\n                    now perception is the
  only immediate source of cognition. Aristotle uses\n                    the term
  “abstraction”\n                    (ἀφαίρεσις)\n                    in connection
  with the objects of mathematics, which\n                    “Platonists” had held
  were separate from the material\n                    world (Ross, p. 566). Aristotle
  maintained that these mathematical\n                    features were, in fact,
  inseparable from material things but could be\n                    thought of separately.
  In the Metaphysics (1060a\n                    28-1061b 31) the process is described
  as fol-\n                    lows: in the mathematician's investigations, he takes
  away\n                    everything that is sensible, e.g., weight and light-\n
  \                       ness, hardness and softness, heat and cold, and all other\n
  \                   sensible contrarieties, and leaves only quantity and continuity
  in one,\n                    two, or three dimensions, as well as the affections\n
  \                   (πάθη) of these quantities. Elsewhere\n                        (Post.
  Anal. 81b 3; De\n                    anima 431b 12ff.; Nic. Eth. 1142a; De caelo
  III, 1, 299a 15) we are repeatedly informed\n                    that the objects
  of mathematics are treated as separate but cannot exist\n                    separately.
  It is this for- mulation which\n                    is repeated throughout the subsequent
  history of abstraction both by those\n                    who follow Aris- totle
  and by those who reject\n                    his views.\n                A point
  here is worthy of remark. The authors from Boethius to modern times\n                    speak
  of abstracting forms (both accidental and mathematical) from\n                    matter,
  whereas Aristotle (as Owens has pointed out) in de- scribing mathematical abstraction
  speaks of\n                    taking away the sensible qualities, and leaving only
  the quan- titative features of physical objects.\n                002\n                \n
  \               Although the process of coming to know the univer-\n                    sal
  from repeated perceptions of particulars is notcalled abstraction—Aristotle here
  uses\n                    “separation”\n                    (χω̂ρίζειν)—there\n
  \                   is at least one passage which, indi- rectly,\n                    connects
  these two activities (Post. Anal. 81b 3).\n                    In both these cases,
  induction\n                    (ἐπαγῶγή)\n                    is associated with
  the process of coming to know the universal,\n                    whether mathematical
  or physical. In the case of mathematical abstraction,\n                    it is
  sometimes indicated that the observed object suggests something which\n                    is
  not actually presented, but the prevailing impression is that the\n                    mathematical
  features are literally in the object, and are discovered by\n                    removing
  from consid- eration all other\n                    sensible qualities.\n                The
  description of cognition given in De anima\n                    and in the Parva
  naturalia is important for\n                    the later devel- opment of the doctrine
  of\n                    abstraction as we find it in medieval writers. The forms
  of sensible\n                    objects without their matter enter the soul, so
  that we know objects\n                    by the presence of their forms in consciousness.
  The form as it exists in\n                    the soul is, presumably, numerically
  different though specifically the same\n                    as the form in the object
  of perception (De\n                    anima III; VIII, 431b 26ff.). The forms of
  objects existing in\n                    the soul are, Aristotle assumes, the fundamental
  elements of thought\n                    which are the referents of the verbal symbols
  of spoken discourse (De interpretatione, I, 16a 3ff; cf. De anima III, 6, 430a 26-430b
  33). So, in many cases at\n                    any rate, the general terms of discourse
  stand for isolable objects of\n                    intellectual consideration. There
  are, how-\n                    ever, exceptions to this, the most important of which
  are the\n                    analogical or systematically ambiguous terms of metaphysics.
  Still, the\n                    assumption that verbal terms usually stand for affections
  of the soul is\n                    one of the important ingredients of the doctrine
  of abstraction which\n                    was later developed by the medieval philoso-\n
  \                   phers.\n                There are two doctrines of Aristotle
  which throw some light on his views\n                    about abstraction. One
  is the contention that human cognition first\n                    comprehends the
  generic features of physical things and only later\n                    comes to
  the specific differentiae (Physica I, 1).\n                    The other is the
  view that the essence of an organism is discovered\n                    regressively
  by first knowing the activities, then the powers, and by\n                    subsequently
  discovering the essence on which such powers depend (De anima II). The former doctrine
  indicates that\n                    there are generic con- cepts. The latter\n                    suggests
  that the concepts of essences, in the case of those of organisms,\n                    are
  really no more than conjunctions of powers. But the view that an\n                    essence
  is an essential unity obviously conflicts with this, because the\n                    coexistence
  of powers expressed by a conjunction of formulae could not\n                    constitute
  the sort of unity of essence that Aristotle seemed to have had\n                     in
  mind. It is, therefore, difficult to understand exactly how\n                    the
  form of anything comes to exist in the soul as an essential unity.\n                Two
  main features, then, characterize Aristotle's view of abstraction:\n                    formal
  aspects of physical reality exist in the soul as separate from\n                    matter
  even though such a separation is impossible in the physical\n                    world
  itself. This is true of generic concepts, of mathematical\n                    aspects
  of things, and, of course, the specific concepts of things.\n                    Cognition
  occurs when a form exists in the soul.\n                That abstraction need not
  involve any falsification is insisted upon by the\n                    medievals,
  and the first state- ment of this\n                    is to be found in Aristotle.
  The mathe-\n                    matician is concerned with the shape and size of
  objects such as the\n                    sun or the moon, for example; but he does
  not consider them as limits of\n                    natural bodies, or with any
  properties of shape or size insofar as they\n                    are aspects of
  physical objects. On the other hand, he separates\n                    shape, etc.,
  though without any falsity result-\n                    ing from such conceptual
  separation (Physica II,\n                    2, 193b 33ff.).\n                The
  accounts which have come down concerning the theories of\n                    concept-formation
  of Stoics and Epi- cureans\n                    contain nothing that can properly
  be described as a theory of abstraction.\n                    Neither of these schools
  accepted the form-matter distinction; they both\n                        main- tained
  a materialistic view of\n                    nature, and the Stoics, at least, were
  nominalists in some sense.\n                For the Stoics, the main function of
  reason was the grasp of the conclusion\n                    of demonstrations such
  as the existence of gods and their providential\n                    activity. Gen-
  eral notions\n                    (νουμένα), they\n                    maintained,
  are gained by contact or by resemblance; some come from\n                    analogy,
  still others by composition or contrariety. In another\n                    testimony,
  general notions are said to arise by way of enlargement or\n                    diminution
  of what is perceived, or by privation (Diog. Laërt.\n                    VII, 52-53).\n
  \               Epicurus and his school, in addition to their atomistic materialism,
  held\n                    that we see, for example, shapes, and think of shapes
  by virtue of the\n                    entrance into the body of something coming
  from external objects. The efflu- ence of atoms coming from the surfaces of\n                    physical
  objects enters the sense organs and produces images.\n                    Universal
  ideas are stored in the mind so that when, for instance, the word\n                    “man”
  is heard, it calls up the shape stored in the\n                    mind. As all
  this must reduce to a physical pattern, it is clear that all\n                    notions
  are ulti- mately derived from\n                    perception by contact, analogy,
  resemblance, or conjunction. None of this\n                    can be called abstraction.\n
  \               Since Plotinus rejected the Aristotelian theory of sensory cognition,
  there\n                    is no place for a doctrine of abstraction in his account
  of our conceptual knowledge003\n                     (Enneads IV, 6, 1-3). The same
  remark holds\n                    for Au- gustine. In his account of sensory\n                    cognition,
  the soul suffers no changes from the sense organs, but is essen- tially active,
  taking note of changes\n                    in the body by a kind of vital attention.
  Hence there can be no taking\n                    of a form into the soul from physical
  nature. An ab- straction, therefore, is out of the question in his\n                    view
  of perception. The doctrine that the laws of numbers and of\n                    wisdom
  are somehow given to human conscious-\n                    ness by interior illumination
  from a divine source takes the place\n                    of abstraction. As Augustine's
  views on these and other questions were\n                    derived from Plo- tinus
  and, indirectly, from\n                    Plato, this is to be expected.\n                The
  commentator, Alexander of Aphrodisias, uses the phrase\n                    ἐξ\n
  \                   ἀφαιρέσεως\n                    in describing the process of
  ob- taining any\n                    form in consciousness as separated from the
  material which it determines in\n                    the external world, and it
  is from this source (Alexander, De anima, pp. 107, 34) that Boethius derived his\n
  \                   account of abstraction (In Isagogen Porphyrii\n                    commenta
  I, 11).\n                According to Boethius, there are many things which cannot
  actually be\n                    separated but which are separated by the soul and
  by\n                    thought—e.g., no one can actually separate a triangle from
  its\n                    material substratum, but a person can mentally separate
  the triangle and\n                    its properties from matter, and contemplate
  it. This sepa- ration does not involve any falsification because falsifi- cation
  can only occur when\n                    something is asserted to exist separately
  which does not or cannot exist\n                        sepa- rately. Thus the separation\n
  \                   achieved by abstraction is not only not false, but is indispensable
  to the\n                    discovery of truth. This means, we propose, that abstraction
  provides\n                    the concepts which are to be united in affirm-\n                        ative
  propositions which truly state what charac- teristics things possess.\n                This
  account of abstraction follows along lines al-\n                        ready laid
  down by Aristotle and is repeated, with elaborations,\n                    by the
  logicians of the twelfth century. Thus Abelard tells us that,\n                    although
  matter and form are always together, the mind can consider each\n                        sepa-
  rately. Thus abstraction does not\n                    falsify because there is
  no assertion that anything has just the\n                    abstracted property
  and no others. The mind considers only one feature\n                    but does
  not assert its separation in fact from other features.\n                    “For
  the thing does not have only it, but the thing is\n                    considered
  only as having it” (Logica\n                        ingredientibus). John of Salisbury
  provides a similar\n                    account. In abstracting a line or surface,
  the abstracting intellect does\n                    not conceive it as existing
  apart from matter. Abstraction is simply a\n                    contemplation of
  form without considering its matter even though the\n                    form cannot
  exist without the matter (Metalogicon\n                    II, Ch. 20). Again, some
  things resemble others and the mind abstracts\n                    from these particular
  individuals and con\n                    siders only the resemblance. In this way,
  the concept of\n                    “man” is abstracted from the perceptions of
  individ- uals, and the concept of\n                    “animal” from man, horse,
  etc. (ibid.).\n                Similar views about abstraction are developed by
  the anonymous author of\n                        De intellectibus (cf. V. Cousin,
  1859)\n                    and it is clear that this general agreement can be accounted
  for by the\n                    fact that all the schoolmen of this period read
  Boethius, and, perhaps,\n                    also by the influence of Abelard.\n
  \               The Arabic translations of Aristotle and some of his earlier Greek\n
  \                   commentators made the doctrine of ab-\n                    straction
  available to the Islamic and Jewish philoso- phers. But there were also translations
  or epitomes\n                    of the writings of Plotinus and Proclus and, even
  when there was no\n                    confusion between Neo-Platonic and Aristotelian
  views, attempts were made\n                    to harmonize Aristotelian and Neo-Platonic
  doctrine. In particular,\n                    the Neo-Platonic system of emanations
  was grafted onto that doctrine of\n                    Aristotle which concerned
  the connection of the Agent Intellect to\n                    individual human cognitive
  activities. The Active Intellect in\n                    Aristotle's psychology
  was identified with the last Intelligence. In\n                    some of these
  systems, the illuminative activity of the active intellect\n                    consists
  in the radiation of forms into the material world and into the\n                    human
  mind. Attempts to combine this doctrine with the doctrine of\n                    abstraction
  produced strange consequences. In Avicenna's (Ibn Sina,\n                    980-1037)
  treatises on psychol- ogy, for\n                    example, there are various degrees
  of abstrac-\n                    tion of forms which correspond to the ascending
  se- quence of cognitive powers, the sensitive, the\n                    imaginative,
  the estimative, and finally the intellective. His account of\n                    abstraction
  of sensible forms seems to conform to the Aristotelian\n                    psychology
  of taking the form of a material object apart from the\n                    matter
  (Avicenna, Psychology, p. 40). But forms\n                    which have no embodiment
  or which are embodied accidentally must be\n                    received from the
  Agent Intellect when the individual human souls have been\n                    prepared
  by the appropriate sense experience to receive these emana- tions (Avicenna, De\n
  \                       anima 5; cf. Al-Ghazali, Meta- physics, pp. 174ff.). This
  explanation of how we\n                    know the nature of qualities and of things
  thus combines a theory of\n                    abstraction properly so-called with
  a doctrine which accounts for\n                    conceptual knowledge by emana-
  tions of forms\n                    from a suprahuman source. This made it congenial
  to many of the earlier\n                    scholastics of the thirteenth century.\n
  \               Another feature of Avicenna's views must be men-\n                        tioned:
  the doctrine of distinctions. This became im- portant for the scholastics of the\n
  \                   thirteenth and four- teenth centuries, and\n                    figures
  in the discussions of the seventeenth century. One of the important\n                    sources
  is004\n                     Aristotle's statement in the Topics that\n                    “if
  one thing is capable of existing without the other, the\n                    former
  will not be the same as the latter” (Topics Book VII, Ch. 2; Becker, p. 152 b34).
  This was taken to be\n                    the test of a real distinction of two
  things. According to Avicenna,\n                    that which is asserted is other
  than that which is not asserted, and what\n                    is conceded is different
  from what is not conceded (De\n                        anima I, 1). So, if someone
  can assert or concede that he\n                    exists even though he does not
  assert or admit that his body exists,\n                    this is sufficient ground
  for holding a real distinction between the mind\n                    and the body.
  A similar idea under- lies\n                    Descartes' mind-body distinction
  as a consequence of cogito, ergo sum.\n                Yet another aspect of Avicenna's
  thought, important to the history of\n                    abstraction, is his doctrine
  of the common nature. Although Avicenna\n                    vehemently denies that
  universals have any extra-mental existence and\n                    although he
  asseverates that individuals alone exist, he maintains that a\n                    nature
  can be contemplated which, in itself, is neither one nor many\n                    (numerically)
  but is simply the nature that it intrinsically is: horseness\n                    is
  simply horseness. This theory of natures was to be used by the\n                    thirteenth-century
  scholastics in diverse ways. Aquinas draws upon it to\n                    avoid
  the Platonic paradox about the one and the many in his De ente et essentia, and
  it is essential to the\n                    views of Duns Scotus. Accord- ing to
  the\n                    latter, the common nature has a unity less than numerical
  unity so that the\n                    paradox of one nature or form in many individuals
  is again avoided. And\n                    it continues to receive support in the
  fourteenth century in the\n                    critique of Ockham by Richard of
  Campsall:Illa natura... non est pleures nec una (Logica, Ch. 15).\n                This
  theory that a nature as such is neither one nor many is essential to\n                    Scotus'
  doctrine of abstraction. For although such a nature cannot be\n                    separated,
  even by divine power, from the individual differences by\n                    which
  each thing is individuated, it can nonetheless be con- sidered apart from such individuating\n
  \                   features by ab- straction.\n                Al-Ghazali (1058-1111)
  criticized Avicenna's view of abstraction along lines\n                    which
  immediately call to mind similar criticisms made later by some fourteenth- century
  nominalists\n                    (especially Ockham) and by some of the nominalists
  of the seventeenth and\n                    eighteenth centuries (especially Hobbes
  and Berkeley). Against the\n                    view that the intelligible universal
  in the intellect is divested of all\n                    specifying or individuating
  determi-\n                    nations, Al-Ghazali urges that everything in the intel-
  lect is derived from the senses and retains all the\n                        con-
  crete determinateness of sense\n                    experience. True, the intellect
  can separate parts of a composite, but\n                    each part thus separated
  is just as individual as was the aggregate\n                    from which it was
  separated. Each wholly\n                     determinate part of an aggregate thus
  separated func- tions as a universal insofar as it is\n                    conceived
  as standing in a relation to all similar individuals, and serves\n                    as
  an image for all other things similar to it (Tahafut..., 1958; cf. Averroës, Tahafut,
  1954). Al-Ghazali may, therefore, be regarded as a precursor\n                    of
  the sort of criticism of abstraction which later nominalists in\n                    Christendom
  were to exploit. There is, of course, no likelihood of any\n                    literary
  influence because this part of Al-Ghazali was not accessible in\n                    Latin
  until the sixteenth century (Zedler, 1961). Moreover,\n                    Averroës
  opposed Al-Ghazali on this point and continued to\n                    uphold the
  Aristotelian doctrine. We find that Mai-\n                        monides (1135-1204)
  also adheres to a doctrine of abstraction\n                    derived mostly from
  Avicenna's Guide of the\n                    Perplexed.\n                In the
  philosophical writings of the early thirteenth century in Christendom\n                    attempts
  were made to ac- commodate the\n                    views of Aristotle to those
  of Saint Augustine. Avicenna's writings on\n                    psychology made
  this accommodation feasible especially to the Fran- ciscans. But we should glance
  at one of\n                    the first at- tempts in this vein by Robert\n                    Grosseteste.\n
  \               In his commentary on the Posterior Analytics,\n                    Gros-
  seteste taught that the mind is\n                    capable of knowledge without
  the aid of the senses. Due to its\n                    incarceration in the body,
  however, the mind is darkened and re- quires the aid of sensation. Accordingly,\n
  \                   abstraction of forms from the data of sensation is normally
  re- quired. So the intellect separates out for\n                    special con-
  sideration the features of\n                    things which are confused in sensation.
  Abstraction of forms usually is\n                    derived from many individual
  objects presented to the senses. But the\n                    knowledge thus attained
  is not of the highest grade.\n                A representative view of the Franciscans
  can be found in Matthew of\n                    Aquasparta. Because the human soul
  is a sort of mean between God and\n                    creatures, it has two aspects,
  one of which, the superior part, is\n                    turned to God; the other,
  the inferior part, is turned toward creatures.\n                    According to
  the doctrine of “the two faces of the\n                    soul,” the correct explanation
  of human knowledge is a medium\n                    between the position of Augustine
  and Aristotle.\n                Knowledge of the world is generated in man by sensation,
  memory, and\n                    experience from which the universal concepts of
  art and science are\n                    derived. But in order fully to understand
  the natures of things thus\n                    abstracted from sensation we require
  an illumination from the Divine Light.\n                    Although we do not see
  Divine Light in our earthly existence, we see the\n                    natures of
  things by its means. The existence of this illumination is\n                    explained
  as follows: we know eternal truths with certainty. These truths\n                    are
  immutable yet everything005\n                     in the world about us and our
  very minds are mutable. So, the\n                    immutable and necessary features
  of our knowledge require the illumination\n                    of the Divine Light.\n
  \               Matthew adopts the Augustinian theory that the corporeal world cannot\n
  \                   produce changes in the soul (the inferior cannot affect the
  superior).\n                    Rather the soul is actively aware of changes occurring
  anywhere in the\n                    body. The data which the soul makes from its
  notice of corporeal changes\n                    are rendered intelligible by the
  Agent Intellect which, Matthew says, is\n                    what Aristotle calls
  abstractions. But these\n                    abstractions are understood in the
  light of the immutable rules\n                    provided by divine illumination.
  This combination of “abstrac- tion” and illumination is\n                    to
  be found in a number of Franciscan thinkers of the thirteenth century.\n                \n
  \                       Saint Thomas Aquinas.\n                     Aquinas expounds
  a theory of abstraction according to which things\n                    (in the sense
  of objects of apprehension) can be considered, one\n                    aspect apart
  from another, in cases in which the two things cannot exist\n                    separated
  from one another. In cases in which one thing can exist apart\n                    from
  another we should speak of “separation” rather\n                    than abstraction
  (Commentary on Boethius' De\n                    Trinitate, Q5, a.3). Since substance,
  which is the intelligible matter\n                    of quantity, can exist without
  quantity, it is possible to consider\n                    substance without quantity.
  Again, to consider “ani- mal” without considering\n                    “stone” is
  not to abstractanimal from stone. Thus it is only\n                    in cases
  where things cannot exist separately but can be considered separately that we can
  properly speak of abstraction.\n                Abstraction is of two kinds: the
  one, mathematical abstraction, involves a\n                    consideration of
  form from sen- sible matter.\n                    The other is the abstraction of
  the univer-\n                    sal from the particular. The possibility of abstraction
  depends on\n                    the fact that things (features of things) exist
  in one way in the realm of\n                    matter, but in another in an intellect
  which apprehends them. Thus, because\n                    the mind is immaterial,
  the natures of material things exist in the\n                    mind in a way suitable
  to the mind, i.e., they have an immaterial existence\n                    in the
  mind. But the simple apprehension of the mind does not involve\n                    any
  assertion that the features of things exist thus in reality,\n                    because
  simple apprehension is not an act which asserts or denies anything\n                    at
  all. The mathematical abstraction which considers only the quantitative\n                    features
  of phys- ical things does not assert\n                    that lines, planes, etc.,
  exist independently of such objects. It merely\n                    considers these
  features without attending to other aspects of\n                    physical objects,
  although the mathematical or quantitative features\n                    cannot exist
  isolated from physical objects.\n                In the case of the abstraction
  of the universal from particulars, the mind\n                    considers the specific
  nature of, say, man or dog, apart from the\n                    individuating aspects\n
  \                    of individual men or dogs. Again, abstrahentium\n                        non
  est mendacium (“abstraction is not\n                    falsification”) be- cause
  the mind\n                    does not assert that the specific nature of man can
  exist apart from\n                    particular men.\n                The generic
  nature common to several species can be abstracted so that the\n                    mind
  thinks only of the generic aspect of these several species and ignores\n                    the
  specific differences. “What is joined in reality, the\n                    intellect
  can at times receive separately, when one of the elements is not\n                    included
  in the notion of the other” (Summa\n                        contra gentiles I, c.
  54, para. 3). So, because the concept\n                    of the genus “animal”
  does not explicitly contain the\n                    concept of, say, “rational,”
  the mind can consider\n                    “animal” without considering any particular
  kind of\n                    animal. But this “animal” is not something existing\n
  \                   apart from particular kinds of animal any more than these particular
  kinds\n                    can exist apart from indi- vidual animals.\n                    Only
  in the mind that apprehends the form of animal stripped of its\n                    individuating
  and speci- fying\n                    characteristics does animal as such exist
  (ibid., I, c. 26, para. 5).\n                Nothing exists in a genus which does
  not exist in some species of that genus\n                    (ibid., I, c. 25, para.
  2).Animal cannot exist in re without\n                    the differentia “ra-\n
  \                   tional” or the differentia “irrational.”\n                    Still
  animal can be considered without these differentiae (ibid., I, c.\n                    26,
  para. 11). There is, however, no purely generic ex- emplar in the divine mind (Summa\n
  \                   theol. I, 15a. 3 ad 4).\n                Duns Scotus adopted
  from Avicenna the doctrine of a common nature which is\n                    in itself
  neither one nor many but simply what is indicated in the\n                    definition
  or description of such a nature. This nature can be\n                    individuated
  in the individuals of a species by the further determination\n                    of
  an individual difference or “haecceity” (i.e.,\n                    “thisness” in
  contrast to\n                    “quiddity” or “whatness”), or\n                    it
  can be rendered a universal con- cept by the\n                    action of the
  active intellect; but in itself it is neither one nor many.\n                The
  process of abstracting a universal concept from the common nature so\n                    conceived
  is not a “real action” because the common\n                    nature is already
  present in the individuals and formally distinguished\n                    from
  the indi- vidual differences prior to\n                    and independent of any
  action of the intellect (Duns Scotus, Quaestiones in metaphyisicorum libros, VII,
  q. 18;\n                        Opus oxoniense II d. 1, q. 5 [q. 6], n. 5). This\n
  \                   formal distinction of the specific nature from the individual
  differences\n                    which contract it to a numerical unity in the various
  individ- uals of the species applies just as\n                    well to the distinction
  between the specific and the generic features of\n                    a common nature,
  for these also are formally distinct in such a way\n                    that the
  mind can think of the generic nature as such. There is, therefore,\n                    no
  distortion or falsification in the result of abstraction, because abstrac-006\n
  \                   \n                    tion amounts to considering one aspect
  of a nature without\n                    considering the others (Opus oxon. III,
  d. 14, q. 2,\n                    n. 12).\n                Thus, the distinctive
  feature of Scotus' contribution to the doctrine of\n                    abstraction
  depends upon his doc- trine of the\n                    formal distinction between
  the individu-\n                    ating and the common nature which exists prior
  to any action of mind\n                    on the data of observation.\n                \n
  \                       William of Ockham.\n                     Ockham uses the
  term “abstrac-\n                        tion” and provides a number of meanings
  for it, but\n                    he departs from his predecessors on one very important
  point: he denies\n                    that we can think as separate what is incapable
  of existing separately in\n                    reality. However, he allows that
  we can understand one thing without\n                    understanding another at
  the same time even though the two things do, in\n                    fact, coexist.
  Thus he states “To abstract is to understand one\n                    thing without
  under- standing another at\n                    the same time even though in reality
  the one is not separated from the\n                    other, e.g., sometimes the
  intellect understands the whiteness which\n                    is in milk and does
  not understand the sweetness of milk. Abstraction in\n                    this sense
  can belong even to a sense, for a sense can apprehend one\n                    sensible
  without apprehending another” (Expositio physicorum, fol. 111c).\n                In
  his commentary on the Sentences (II, qq. 14, 15\n                    xx) Ockham
  tells us that the abstraction of the agent intellect is twofold.\n                    On
  the one hand, it produces a thought (an intellection) which is either\n                    intuitive
  or abstractive, is wholly abstracted from matter because it\n                    is
  immaterial in itself, and has its existence in some- thing immaterial (i.e., in
  the soul). On the other\n                    hand, the abstraction produces a universal,
  i.e., a universal concept\n                    of a thing in representative existence.\n
  \               In still another sense, abstraction occurs when one predicable is
  predicated\n                    of a subject and another pre- dicable is not\n                    predicable
  of that subject even though the latter predicable applies to the\n                    subject.
  This takes place in mathematics. For the mathematician\n                    considers
  only such statements as “Every body is divisible, is\n                    so long
  and so deep,” and ignores statements about bodies\n                    which pertain
  to motion, to the composition of matter and form in physical\n                    things,
  etc.\n                Accordingly, Ockham allows that many things are really distinct
  which\n                    constitute a unity, as in the case of matter and form,
  or substance and\n                    accident. Now it is true that, in such cases,
  the mind can separate or\n                    divide these from one another so as
  to understand one and not understand\n                    the other. But if a and
  b are\n                    one thing and a may not be really distinguished fromb,
  it is impossible that the mind may divide a fromb so as to understand either without
  understanding\n                    the other (Sent. I, d. 2, q. 3, H).\n                Hence,
  Ockham rejects any abstraction of a common\n                     nature or form
  from its instances in such a way that the mind\n                    can contemplate
  the common nature as such. The only distinction Ockham will\n                    allow
  is the real distinction of one thing from another thing. A distinc- tion between
  the common nature and an\n                    individual difference which Scotus
  had defended is, for Ockham,\n                    entirely out of the question (Sent.
  I d, qq. 1-4).\n                The reason why Ockham can allow the abstraction
  of matter and form in an\n                    individual physical object is because,
  for him, this matter and this form\n                    could exist apart from one
  another, at least by divine power. The same\n                    is true of accident
  and substance. An accident can be thought without its\n                    substratum
  because an accident and its substratum are two really\n                    distinct
  things, and one can exist without the other (Sent. II, q. 5, M; cf. I, d. 30, q.
  1, P).\n                Thus Ockham, as Vignaux observed, adopted the principle,
  much later\n                    exploited by Hume, that what- ever is\n                    distinguishable
  is separable. And like Hume, he practically rejected the\n                    distinction
  of reason. The result was a rejection of the central tenet of\n                    the
  classi- cal doctrine of abstraction, set\n                    forth by Aristotle
  and defended, in one form or another, by many of\n                    the scholastics
  of the twelfth and later centuries.\n                \n                        Descartes.\n
  \                    There were many elaborations of the Thomistic doctrine among
  the\n                    later scholastics of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
  by Cajetan,\n                    Suarez, John of St. Thomas and others. Suarez in
  particular, was\n                    responsible for sharpening the differences
  between abstraction and\n                    distinction (or “separation” as Saint
  Thomas had\n                    called it). And this, in turn, was almost certainly
  the immediate source of\n                    Descartes' views.\n                While
  Descartes allows that abstraction takes place in the mind, he is\n                    always
  at pains to notice that abstrac- tion\n                    renders our concepts
  inadequate in such a way that we cannot discover the\n                    important
  distinction of things. Thus, the distinction of reason by which\n                    a
  substance is distinguished from its principal attribute (of thought\n                    or
  extension as the case may be) is effected by abstracting one from the\n                    other.
  This is accomplished only with some difficulty and the result does\n                    not
  corre- spond with anything in the way of\n                    a real separation
  of a substance from its nature or attribute (Principles of Philosophy, I, 63). Thus
  the valuable\n                    operation of the mind is that which provides us
  with a real distinc- tion. This Descartes sometimes calls\n                    “exclusion.”
  The principal difference which Descartes\n                    makes between abstraction
  and exclusion is that, in the case of abstrac- tion we consider one thing without\n
  \                   considering that from which abstraction has been made and so
  may not\n                    be aware that abstraction has rendered a concept in-\n
  \                       adequate, whereas in distinguishing one thing\n                    from
  another, we must keep both clearly before us. Consid- ering an abstraction by itself
  prevents us from knowing007\n                     well what it has been abstracted
  from (Letter to Clerselier, 12\n                    Jan. 1646).\n                The
  influence of Descartes on the so-called Port-\n                        Royal Logic
  of Antoine Arnauld (1612-94) is obvious. But this\n                    famous treatise
  presents an account of abstrac-\n                        tion which agrees in essential
  features with the stand- ard medieval view. Arnauld had argued, in his\n                    critique
  of Descartes, that the genus can be conceived without\n                    conceiving
  its species so that, for example, one can conceive figure\n                    without
  conceiving any of the charac-\n                    teristics proper to such a particular
  figure as a circle\n                    (“Fourth Objections”). Again, length can
  be conceived\n                    without breadth or depth. But such abstraction,
  prop-\n                        erly so-called, is only between aspects of things
  which are only\n                    distinct by a distinction of reason. Where things
  really distinct are\n                    distinguished, abstraction does not occur
  (La Logique\n                        ou l'art de penser [1662], Part I, Ch. 5).\n
  \               \n                        John Locke.\n                     The
  discussion of abstraction which is perhaps most familiar to\n                    modern
  readers is to be found in Locke's Essay Concerning\n                        Human
  Understanding.\n                \n                    \n                        Words
  become general by being made the signs of general ideas; and\n                            ideas
  become general by separating from them the circumstances of\n                            time
  and place, and any other ideas that may determine them to this\n                            or
  that particular existence. By this way of abstraction they are\n                            made
  capable of repre- senting more\n                            individuals than one;
  each of which having in it a conformity to\n                            that abstract
  idea, is (as we call it) of that sort\n                    \n                    \n
  \                       (Book III, Ch. 3, para. 6).\n                    \n                \n
  \               He goes on to suggest immediately that nothing new is introduced
  in this\n                    process but that it is rather a process of omitting
  all individuating\n                    features, and re- taining only what is common\n
  \                   to all of a set of resem- bling particulars.\n                    This
  omission, he explains elsewhere (Book II, Ch. 13, para. 13), is a kind\n                    of
  partial consid- eration which does not\n                    imply a separation.
  But Locke applies the notion of abstraction to cases\n                    which
  go beyond the mere omission of particular spatiotemporal\n                    determinations.
  In the famous example of forming the general idea of a\n                    triangle,
  Locke says that this idea of triangle in general is\n                    “something
  imperfect that cannot exist, an idea wherein some\n                    parts of
  several different and inconsistent ideas are put\n                    together”
  (Book IV, Ch. 7, para. 9). Whatever Locke may have\n                    thought
  this “putting together” amounted to, it is\n                    certainly not achieved
  simply by omitting particularizing features of\n                    several particular
  triangles. The fact is that no single doctrine of\n                    abstraction
  can be found in Locke, as I. A. Aaron has shown (Aaron, 1937).\n                \n
  \                       Berkeley and Hume.\n                     Berkeley's critique
  of abstrac- tion\n                    proceeds along lines which were relatively
  new to his readers but which had\n                    already been worked out by
  Al-Ghazali in the eleventh century and even\n                    by Ockham in the
  fourteenth century. If two things (in\n                     Berkeley's philosophy,
  of course, two ideas) can exist\n                    separately, the mind can abstract
  one from the other. But if it is granted\n                    that two things cannot
  exist one apart from the other, i.e., that there\n                    would be a
  con- tradiction if a were supposed to exist without b\n                    (or conversely),
  the mind cannot think of a without\n                        b or of b without a.
  To argue otherwise would be to attrib- ute to the human mind a power which not even
  God\n                    can be supposed to have or exercise.\n                Hume
  adopted Berkeley's critique and elaborated a positive theory of the\n                    function
  of general terms which goes beyond Berkeley. Although every idea\n                    is
  particu- lar, some ideas can function as\n                    general ones by being
  associated with a name of a number of\n                    particulars which resemble
  one another exactly or only approxi- mately. In the latter case, the\n                    name
  is associated with a number of qualitatively different but\n                    resembling
  images. One of these associated images will be domi- nant, the others relatively
  recessive but,\n                    as Hume puts it, “present in power to be recalled
  by design or\n                        neces- sity.” Thus, although a\n                    red
  image may be recalled when the word “color” is\n                    pronounced,
  heard, read, or re- called, other\n                    color-images less strongly
  associated with the word\n                    “color” tend to appear in consciousness,
  are\n                    “present in power,” and will be recalled if there is\n
  \                   danger of a mistakenly narrow use of “color” present- ing itself.
  This then, is Hume's\n                    alternative to the doc- trine that there
  are\n                    either genuine images or abstract general ideas. The traditional\n
  \                   explanation of the ori- gin of abstract concepts\n                    persisted,
  with some modi- fications,\n                    among the philosophers of the eighteenth
  century.\n                A considerable advance in the understanding of the nature
  and function of\n                    concepts seems to have been made by Immanuel
  Kant. The verb, adjective, and\n                    noun frequently occur in Kant's
  Critique of Pure\n                    Reason (Werke, A54, A70 [B95], A76, A96)\n
  \                   without any special explanation. But Kant's doctrine of pure
  as well as a posteriori concepts leaves no doubt that\n                    abstraction
  alone cannot account for the existence or employment of\n                    concepts
  (Werke, VII, 400-01). “The form of\n                    a concept, as a discursive
  representation is always con- structed.” As Kant puts it in the Prolegomena to any
  Future Metaphysics (para. 20),\n                    empirical concepts would not
  be possible unless a pure concept were\n                    added to the particular
  concept which has been ab-\n                        stracted from intuition. And,
  finally, in the Critique of Pure Reason, the concept is presented as a rule by means
  of which the imagination can outline,\n                    for exam- ple, the figure
  of a certain quadruped\n                    (say, a dog) without limiting it to
  such a\n                    determinate figure as one's experience or concrete images
  might present.\n                    Kant calls this a schema. Without such a schema
  (which is an\n                    application of the pure concepts of the under-008\n
  \                   \n                    standing) neither images nor a conceptualization
  of images\n                    would be possible.\n                Kant's doctrine
  that pure concepts, i.e., the cate-\n                        gories of the understanding,
  be at the basis of all con- ceptual thinking thus makes the process of\n                    abstraction
  subsidiary to and dependent upon faculties which are\n                    logically
  prior to any process of abstraction from em- pirical data. As more than one writer
  has recently\n                    pointed out, empirical concepts are more like
  disposi- tions than like static constituents of\n                    consciousness.
  There is, however, no suggestion in Kant that abstrac- tion does not occur. That
  this new\n                    view of the activities of the mind would require an
  entirely different\n                    account of abstraction is not made very
  plain in Kant's writings.\n                In the development of metaphysical Idealism
  in the post-Kantian\n                    philosophers, the notion of abstraction
  becomes very general, so general in\n                    fact that the origi- nal
  meanings of the term\n                    seem almost lost. What makes the matter
  even more difficult to discuss is\n                    the fact that, among these
  Idealists, any separation or isolation of\n                    one content or feature
  of experience or thought from another is condemned\n                    as falsification,
  so that “to ab-\n                    stract,” “abstract,”\n                    “abstraction,”
  all acquire a pejora- tive sense. To separate the cognizing subject from\n                    its
  object, to attend to one discriminable element apart from its\n                    surrounding,
  and the like, are all condemned as falsifications of reality.\n                    This
  condemnation rests on the Hegelian doctrine that “the Truth\n                    is
  the Whole,” i.e., that all aspects of thought and reality are\n                        dialecti-
  cally interconnected.\n                Other more significant attacks on the doctrine
  that general concepts result\n                    from abstraction come from Husserl's
  thorough critique of Locke and his\n                        eight- eenth-century
  critics.\n                    While insisting on the absurdity of Locke's doctrine,
  Husserl attacked with\n                    equal vehe- mence the theories of Berkeley,\n
  \                   Hume, and Mill. He insisted that the general attributes are
  given to con- sciousness initially, and thus\n                    repudiated the
  traditional doctrine of abstraction. There are similar views\n                    to
  be found in some of the writings of Whitehead and San- tayana. The “eternal objects”
  of\n                    Whitehead and the “essences” of Santayana are\n                    supposed
  to be discoveries rather than constructions; they are not the\n                    results
  of creations of mental activities, and thus are not the result\n                    of
  abstraction as it was traditionally expounded, although the accounts of\n                    abstraction
  in terms of atten- tion and\n                    comparisons would be consistent
  with such views.\n                One of the most significant critiques of abstraction
  comes from Gottlob\n                    Frege, in his Grundlagen der Arithmetik\n
  \                   (1884). While Frege appears to allow that “color, weight, and\n
  \                   hardness” are abstracted from ob-\n                    jects,
  he holds that number is not so abstracted.\n                    His theory of the
  concept of cardinal number makes it\n                     impossible to obtain the
  number concept by simply omitting\n                    features of empirically accessible
  objects. Because a number is a\n                    “property” of properties, it
  is not available from\n                    empirical inspection of individuals.
  And if we examine Frege's definitions\n                    of particular finite
  cardinals we see at once why the notion of cardi- nal numbers can hardly be extracted
  as\n                    traditional abstraction doctrines suggest. The number one,
  for\n                    example, is a characteristic of any “property F”\n                    which
  satisfies the following condition: there is that which is F and which is the same
  as anything which is F, more exactly: (∃x)(Fx(y)(Fy. ⊃. y = x). It is readily seen,
  if we remove the expression\n                        “F” from the above formula\n
  \                   thus obtaining (∃x). (–x. (y) –y. ∃. y = x, that the property
  of F is\n                    expressible solely in terms of logical constants. Now
  because these\n                    constants function in discourse in a manner that
  is not compara- ble with the way indicative or\n                    descriptive
  expressions function, it is hardly surprising that there is\n                    nothing
  available empirically from which they can be ab- stracted or upon which attention
  may be concentrated.\n                    A psychological account of the origin
  of the notion of number will\n                    doubtless be a very complicated
  affair but it will necessarily be radically\n                    different from
  ab-\n                        straction.\n                The technique employed
  by Frege, Georg Cantor, and some others to elucidate\n                    the mathematical
  notions of cardinal number was recognized by Bertrand\n                    Russell
  as an application of a general principle which Russell called\n                    “the
  principle of abstraction.” But he added that it\n                    would have
  been better called the principle “for the avoidance\n                    of abstraction.”
  The principle is this: for any relation S which is transitive and symmetrical there
  is a\n                    relation R which is a many-one relation such that\n                    whenever
  xSy, there is a unique term z such that xRz and yRz; conversely, if there is a many-one
  relationR such that there is a unique term z so that xRz andyRz, there is a relation
  S which\n                    is transitive and sym- metrical (Principia Mathematica,
  Vol. 1, °72).\n                The essential principle to notice here is that, instead
  of attempting to\n                    account for the concept by a psycho-\n                    logical
  theory by which the concept is derived some- how from the data of the senses or
  from some innate\n                    or at least internal feature of human consciousness,
  the concept is\n                    constructed by logical means from fairly simple
  relational concepts. Thus,\n                    a cardinal number is defined as
  either a class of those classes whose num- bers can be bi-uniquely correlated (in
  a one\n                    to one correspondence) with one another, or, as a propertyP
  of those properties q1, q2,..., qr such that those\n                    things having
  any one of these properties can be corre- lated bi-uniquely with the things having
  any other\n                    of these properties.\n                The formal
  definition of cardinal number brings into009\n                     prominence the
  fact that it is constructed by means of\n                    variables ranging over
  individuals and properties, and by logical\n                    connectives and
  quantifiers. There is nothing about such a construction\n                    which
  even suggests that it could have been\n                    “abstracted” (in the
  traditional sense) from sense\n                    given materials or that there
  is some “inner” source\n                    of the notion. It can be objected to
  all this that this logical\n                    construction of concepts of cardi-
  nal and\n                    ordinal numbers does not explain their psycho-\n                        logical
  origin. Doubtless this is correct. Frege and Russell\n                    probably
  both supposed that they were eluci-\n                    dating the nature of mathematical
  objects which are somehow given\n                    (in some very different way
  from ab-\n                    straction), whereas they were actually recommending
  the replacement\n                    of obscure notions by clear ones. But whatever
  the psychological origin of\n                    mathematical concepts may be, the
  Frege-Russell construction shows\n                    that it must be far more complex
  than anything pro-\n                        posed by the traditional abstraction
  theories. So, while the\n                    psychological question remains a highly
  interesting one, the focus of\n                    interest has shifted to the logical
  content of formal concepts.\n                \n                    \n                        BIBLIOGRAPHY\n

  \               \n             Dictionary of the History of IdeasThe term “abstraction”
  is the\n                    usual expression in medi- eval philosophical\n                    terminology
  for several processes distinguished in Aristotle's writings by\n                    different
  terms, viz., aphairesis\n                    (ἄφαιρεσις)\n                    and
  korismos\n                    (χωρισμός)\n                    described in different
  ways. In all probability, it was Boethius who\n                    introduced the
  Latin abstractio andabstrahere to translate these Greek nouns and the re- lated
  verbs.The main theories of concept formation in Greek antiquity were those of\n
  \                   Democritus, Plato, and Aris- totle (Beare,\n                    1906).
  According to all these theories, sense perception and intellectual\n                    cognition
  have to be distinguished both by their objects and by their\n                    nature.
  For Democritus and the Atomists, knowledge as well as sense\n                    perception
  arises from effluvia of atoms which are continually thrown off\n                    from
  the surfaces of physical objects, and eventually enter the percipient\n                    through
  the various sense organs. Intellectual cognition depends on\n                    finer
  and subtler effluvia. This theory was further developed by the\n                    Epicureans.The
  difference between sense objects and the objects of intellectual\n                    cognition
  were also recognized by Plato but accounted for in a very\n                    different
  way. It is gener- ally assumed that\n                    Plato adopted the Heraclitean
  view that the physical world is in continuous\n                    flux so that
  it never exhibits stable objects for sensory cognition.\n                    Because
  we know, for example, the objects of moral ideals and of\n                    mathematics,
  it was necessary to assume a nonsensory origin of this\n                    knowledge.
  Objects of knowledge really are; objects of sense are\n                    perpetually
  becoming. The objects of intellectual cognition, ac- cordingly, must have been stored
  up in us\n                    from a previous existence. Knowledge, properly so-called,
  is\n                    reminiscence.As the Platonic Forms are separate from the
  physical world of flux, the\n                    knowledge of Forms can only be
  suggested by the approximations to them that\n                    the physical world
  is able temporarily to manifest. The theory, which\n                    Plato expressly
  defended in the Meno (81C), Phaedo (73A), and Phaedrus (247C)\n                    and
  nowhere expressly abandoned, is that we possess knowledge of the\n                    Forms
  from a previous existence, and that so-called learning is really\n                    reminiscence.
  Accordingly, we should not expect to find anything like a\n                    doctrine
  of abstrac- tion in Plato's\n                    writings. The need for such a doctrine
  as we find in Aristotle is\n                    occasioned by Aristotle's insistence
  that the Forms of material things are\n                    not separate realities,
  yet we seem to be able to consider them\n                    without considering
  the matter or without con-\n                        sidering other concrete features
  of material things. Separate\n                    Forms provide us with difficulties
  but not\n                     with this particular one. Plato's insistence that
  we are\n                    acquainted with objects that are nowhere completely
  realized in the\n                    physical world requires a different ac- count
  of\n                    our knowledge of such objects, and Plato found the theory
  of reminiscence\n                    the only suitable explanation.But if there
  is no doctrine of abstraction in Plato's works, there are\n                    passages
  which might have suggested the doctrine to his successor,\n                    Aristotle.
  It is sufficient to mention here only the passage in the Phaedrus (249B-C) where
  it is written that\n                    “man must needs understand the language
  of Forms, passing from\n                    a plurality of perceptions to a unity
  gathered together by\n                    reasoning” (Hackforth, 1952). Since, in
  the very next sentence,\n                    we are informed that “this understanding
  is the recollection of\n                    those things which our souls beheld
  aforetime...,” the intention\n                    of the passage is clear enough.
  But the notion that this unity\n                    (ἕν) is somehow connected with
  a multitude of\n                    perceptions might have been one of the suggestions
  which led Aristotle to\n                    his doctrine of abstraction.It was Aristotle's
  view that form and matter are joined in physical objects\n                    that
  made a theory of abstrac- tion both\n                    possible and necessary:
  possible because forms otherwise could not be known\n                    by way
  of per- ception and necessary because\n                    now perception is the
  only immediate source of cognition. Aristotle uses\n                    the term
  “abstraction”\n                    (ἀφαίρεσις)\n                    in connection
  with the objects of mathematics, which\n                    “Platonists” had held
  were separate from the material\n                    world (Ross, p. 566). Aristotle
  maintained that these mathematical\n                    features were, in fact,
  inseparable from material things but could be\n                    thought of separately.
  In the Metaphysics (1060a\n                    28-1061b 31) the process is described
  as fol-\n                    lows: in the mathematician's investigations, he takes
  away\n                    everything that is sensible, e.g., weight and light-\n
  \                       ness, hardness and softness, heat and cold, and all other\n
  \                   sensible contrarieties, and leaves only quantity and continuity
  in one,\n                    two, or three dimensions, as well as the affections\n
  \                   (πάθη) of these quantities. Elsewhere\n                        (Post.
  Anal. 81b 3; De\n                    anima 431b 12ff.; Nic. Eth. 1142a; De caelo
  III, 1, 299a 15) we are repeatedly informed\n                    that the objects
  of mathematics are treated as separate but cannot exist\n                    separately.
  It is this for- mulation which\n                    is repeated throughout the subsequent
  history of abstraction both by those\n                    who follow Aris- totle
  and by those who reject\n                    his views.A point here is worthy of
  remark. The authors from Boethius to modern times\n                    speak of
  abstracting forms (both accidental and mathematical) from\n                    matter,
  whereas Aristotle (as Owens has pointed out) in de- scribing mathematical abstraction
  speaks of\n                    taking away the sensible qualities, and leaving only
  the quan- titative features of physical objects.Although the process of coming to
  know the univer-\n                    sal from repeated perceptions of particulars
  is notcalled abstraction—Aristotle here uses\n                    “separation”\n
  \                   (χω̂ρίζειν)—there\n                    is at least one passage
  which, indi- rectly,\n                    connects these two activities (Post. Anal.
  81b 3).\n                    In both these cases, induction\n                    (ἐπαγῶγή)\n
  \                   is associated with the process of coming to know the universal,\n
  \                   whether mathematical or physical. In the case of mathematical
  abstraction,\n                    it is sometimes indicated that the observed object
  suggests something which\n                    is not actually presented, but the
  prevailing impression is that the\n                    mathematical features are
  literally in the object, and are discovered by\n                    removing from
  consid- eration all other\n                    sensible qualities.The description
  of cognition given in De anima\n                    and in the Parva naturalia is
  important for\n                    the later devel- opment of the doctrine of\n
  \                   abstraction as we find it in medieval writers. The forms of
  sensible\n                    objects without their matter enter the soul, so that
  we know objects\n                    by the presence of their forms in consciousness.
  The form as it exists in\n                    the soul is, presumably, numerically
  different though specifically the same\n                    as the form in the object
  of perception (De\n                    anima III; VIII, 431b 26ff.). The forms of
  objects existing in\n                    the soul are, Aristotle assumes, the fundamental
  elements of thought\n                    which are the referents of the verbal symbols
  of spoken discourse (De interpretatione, I, 16a 3ff; cf. De anima III, 6, 430a 26-430b
  33). So, in many cases at\n                    any rate, the general terms of discourse
  stand for isolable objects of\n                    intellectual consideration. There
  are, how-\n                    ever, exceptions to this, the most important of which
  are the\n                    analogical or systematically ambiguous terms of metaphysics.
  Still, the\n                    assumption that verbal terms usually stand for affections
  of the soul is\n                    one of the important ingredients of the doctrine
  of abstraction which\n                    was later developed by the medieval philoso-\n
  \                   phers.There are two doctrines of Aristotle which throw some
  light on his views\n                    about abstraction. One is the contention
  that human cognition first\n                    comprehends the generic features
  of physical things and only later\n                    comes to the specific differentiae
  (Physica I, 1).\n                    The other is the view that the essence of an
  organism is discovered\n                    regressively by first knowing the activities,
  then the powers, and by\n                    subsequently discovering the essence
  on which such powers depend (De anima II). The former doctrine indicates that\n
  \                   there are generic con- cepts. The latter\n                    suggests
  that the concepts of essences, in the case of those of organisms,\n                    are
  really no more than conjunctions of powers. But the view that an\n                    essence
  is an essential unity obviously conflicts with this, because the\n                    coexistence
  of powers expressed by a conjunction of formulae could not\n                    constitute
  the sort of unity of essence that Aristotle seemed to have had\n                     in
  mind. It is, therefore, difficult to understand exactly how\n                    the
  form of anything comes to exist in the soul as an essential unity.Two main features,
  then, characterize Aristotle's view of abstraction:\n                    formal
  aspects of physical reality exist in the soul as separate from\n                    matter
  even though such a separation is impossible in the physical\n                    world
  itself. This is true of generic concepts, of mathematical\n                    aspects
  of things, and, of course, the specific concepts of things.\n                    Cognition
  occurs when a form exists in the soul.That abstraction need not involve any falsification
  is insisted upon by the\n                    medievals, and the first state- ment
  of this\n                    is to be found in Aristotle. The mathe-\n                    matician
  is concerned with the shape and size of objects such as the\n                    sun
  or the moon, for example; but he does not consider them as limits of\n                    natural
  bodies, or with any properties of shape or size insofar as they\n                    are
  aspects of physical objects. On the other hand, he separates\n                    shape,
  etc., though without any falsity result-\n                    ing from such conceptual
  separation (Physica II,\n                    2, 193b 33ff.).The accounts which have
  come down concerning the theories of\n                    concept-formation of Stoics
  and Epi- cureans\n                    contain nothing that can properly be described
  as a theory of abstraction.\n                    Neither of these schools accepted
  the form-matter distinction; they both\n                        main- tained a materialistic
  view of\n                    nature, and the Stoics, at least, were nominalists
  in some sense.For the Stoics, the main function of reason was the grasp of the conclusion\n
  \                   of demonstrations such as the existence of gods and their providential\n
  \                   activity. Gen- eral notions\n                    (νουμένα),
  they\n                    maintained, are gained by contact or by resemblance; some
  come from\n                    analogy, still others by composition or contrariety.
  In another\n                    testimony, general notions are said to arise by
  way of enlargement or\n                    diminution of what is perceived, or by
  privation (Diog. Laërt.\n                    VII, 52-53).Epicurus and his school,
  in addition to their atomistic materialism, held\n                    that we see,
  for example, shapes, and think of shapes by virtue of the\n                    entrance
  into the body of something coming from external objects. The efflu- ence of atoms
  coming from the surfaces of\n                    physical objects enters the sense
  organs and produces images.\n                    Universal ideas are stored in the
  mind so that when, for instance, the word\n                    “man” is heard, it
  calls up the shape stored in the\n                    mind. As all this must reduce
  to a physical pattern, it is clear that all\n                    notions are ulti-
  mately derived from\n                    perception by contact, analogy, resemblance,
  or conjunction. None of this\n                    can be called abstraction.Since
  Plotinus rejected the Aristotelian theory of sensory cognition, there\n                    is
  no place for a doctrine of abstraction in his account of our conceptual knowledgeThe
  commentator, Alexander of Aphrodisias, uses the phrase\n                    ἐξ\n
  \                   ἀφαιρέσεως\n                    in describing the process of
  ob- taining any\n                    form in consciousness as separated from the
  material which it determines in\n                    the external world, and it
  is from this source (Alexander, De anima, pp. 107, 34) that Boethius derived his\n
  \                   account of abstraction (In Isagogen Porphyrii\n                    commenta
  I, 11).According to Boethius, there are many things which cannot actually be\n                    separated
  but which are separated by the soul and by\n                    thought—e.g., no
  one can actually separate a triangle from its\n                    material substratum,
  but a person can mentally separate the triangle and\n                    its properties
  from matter, and contemplate it. This sepa- ration does not involve any falsification
  because falsifi- cation can only occur when\n                    something is asserted
  to exist separately which does not or cannot exist\n                        sepa-
  rately. Thus the separation\n                    achieved by abstraction is not
  only not false, but is indispensable to the\n                    discovery of truth.
  This means, we propose, that abstraction provides\n                    the concepts
  which are to be united in affirm-\n                        ative propositions which
  truly state what charac- teristics things possess.This account of abstraction follows
  along lines al-\n                        ready laid down by Aristotle and is repeated,
  with elaborations,\n                    by the logicians of the twelfth century.
  Thus Abelard tells us that,\n                    although matter and form are always
  together, the mind can consider each\n                        sepa- rately. Thus
  abstraction does not\n                    falsify because there is no assertion
  that anything has just the\n                    abstracted property and no others.
  The mind considers only one feature\n                    but does not assert its
  separation in fact from other features.\n                    “For the thing does
  not have only it, but the thing is\n                    considered only as having
  it” (Logica\n                        ingredientibus). John of Salisbury provides
  a similar\n                    account. In abstracting a line or surface, the abstracting
  intellect does\n                    not conceive it as existing apart from matter.
  Abstraction is simply a\n                    contemplation of form without considering
  its matter even though the\n                    form cannot exist without the matter
  (Metalogicon\n                    II, Ch. 20). Again, some things resemble others
  and the mind abstracts\n                    from these particular individuals and
  con\n                    siders only the resemblance. In this way, the concept of\n
  \                   “man” is abstracted from the perceptions of individ- uals, and
  the concept of\n                    “animal” from man, horse, etc. (ibid.).Similar
  views about abstraction are developed by the anonymous author of\n                        De
  intellectibus (cf. V. Cousin, 1859)\n                    and it is clear that this
  general agreement can be accounted for by the\n                    fact that all
  the schoolmen of this period read Boethius, and, perhaps,\n                    also
  by the influence of Abelard.The Arabic translations of Aristotle and some of his
  earlier Greek\n                    commentators made the doctrine of ab-\n                    straction
  available to the Islamic and Jewish philoso- phers. But there were also translations
  or epitomes\n                    of the writings of Plotinus and Proclus and, even
  when there was no\n                    confusion between Neo-Platonic and Aristotelian
  views, attempts were made\n                    to harmonize Aristotelian and Neo-Platonic
  doctrine. In particular,\n                    the Neo-Platonic system of emanations
  was grafted onto that doctrine of\n                    Aristotle which concerned
  the connection of the Agent Intellect to\n                    individual human cognitive
  activities. The Active Intellect in\n                    Aristotle's psychology
  was identified with the last Intelligence. In\n                    some of these
  systems, the illuminative activity of the active intellect\n                    consists
  in the radiation of forms into the material world and into the\n                    human
  mind. Attempts to combine this doctrine with the doctrine of\n                    abstraction
  produced strange consequences. In Avicenna's (Ibn Sina,\n                    980-1037)
  treatises on psychol- ogy, for\n                    example, there are various degrees
  of abstrac-\n                    tion of forms which correspond to the ascending
  se- quence of cognitive powers, the sensitive, the\n                    imaginative,
  the estimative, and finally the intellective. His account of\n                    abstraction
  of sensible forms seems to conform to the Aristotelian\n                    psychology
  of taking the form of a material object apart from the\n                    matter
  (Avicenna, Psychology, p. 40). But forms\n                    which have no embodiment
  or which are embodied accidentally must be\n                    received from the
  Agent Intellect when the individual human souls have been\n                    prepared
  by the appropriate sense experience to receive these emana- tions (Avicenna, De\n
  \                       anima 5; cf. Al-Ghazali, Meta- physics, pp. 174ff.). This
  explanation of how we\n                    know the nature of qualities and of things
  thus combines a theory of\n                    abstraction properly so-called with
  a doctrine which accounts for\n                    conceptual knowledge by emana-
  tions of forms\n                    from a suprahuman source. This made it congenial
  to many of the earlier\n                    scholastics of the thirteenth century.Another
  feature of Avicenna's views must be men-\n                        tioned: the doctrine
  of distinctions. This became im- portant for the scholastics of the\n                    thirteenth
  and four- teenth centuries, and\n                    figures in the discussions
  of the seventeenth century. One of the important\n                    sources isYet
  another aspect of Avicenna's thought, important to the history of\n                    abstraction,
  is his doctrine of the common nature. Although Avicenna\n                    vehemently
  denies that universals have any extra-mental existence and\n                    although
  he asseverates that individuals alone exist, he maintains that a\n                    nature
  can be contemplated which, in itself, is neither one nor many\n                    (numerically)
  but is simply the nature that it intrinsically is: horseness\n                    is
  simply horseness. This theory of natures was to be used by the\n                    thirteenth-century
  scholastics in diverse ways. Aquinas draws upon it to\n                    avoid
  the Platonic paradox about the one and the many in his De ente et essentia, and
  it is essential to the\n                    views of Duns Scotus. Accord- ing to
  the\n                    latter, the common nature has a unity less than numerical
  unity so that the\n                    paradox of one nature or form in many individuals
  is again avoided. And\n                    it continues to receive support in the
  fourteenth century in the\n                    critique of Ockham by Richard of
  Campsall:Illa natura... non est pleures nec una (Logica, Ch. 15).This theory that
  a nature as such is neither one nor many is essential to\n                    Scotus'
  doctrine of abstraction. For although such a nature cannot be\n                    separated,
  even by divine power, from the individual differences by\n                    which
  each thing is individuated, it can nonetheless be con- sidered apart from such individuating\n
  \                   features by ab- straction.Al-Ghazali (1058-1111) criticized
  Avicenna's view of abstraction along lines\n                    which immediately
  call to mind similar criticisms made later by some fourteenth- century nominalists\n
  \                   (especially Ockham) and by some of the nominalists of the seventeenth
  and\n                    eighteenth centuries (especially Hobbes and Berkeley).
  Against the\n                    view that the intelligible universal in the intellect
  is divested of all\n                    specifying or individuating determi-\n                    nations,
  Al-Ghazali urges that everything in the intel- lect is derived from the senses and
  retains all the\n                        con- crete determinateness of sense\n                    experience.
  True, the intellect can separate parts of a composite, but\n                    each
  part thus separated is just as individual as was the aggregate\n                    from
  which it was separated. Each wholly\n                     determinate part of an
  aggregate thus separated func- tions as a universal insofar as it is\n                    conceived
  as standing in a relation to all similar individuals, and serves\n                    as
  an image for all other things similar to it (Tahafut..., 1958; cf. Averroës, Tahafut,
  1954). Al-Ghazali may, therefore, be regarded as a precursor\n                    of
  the sort of criticism of abstraction which later nominalists in\n                    Christendom
  were to exploit. There is, of course, no likelihood of any\n                    literary
  influence because this part of Al-Ghazali was not accessible in\n                    Latin
  until the sixteenth century (Zedler, 1961). Moreover,\n                    Averroës
  opposed Al-Ghazali on this point and continued to\n                    uphold the
  Aristotelian doctrine. We find that Mai-\n                        monides (1135-1204)
  also adheres to a doctrine of abstraction\n                    derived mostly from
  Avicenna's Guide of the\n                    Perplexed.In the philosophical writings
  of the early thirteenth century in Christendom\n                    attempts were
  made to ac- commodate the\n                    views of Aristotle to those of Saint
  Augustine. Avicenna's writings on\n                    psychology made this accommodation
  feasible especially to the Fran- ciscans. But we should glance at one of\n                    the
  first at- tempts in this vein by Robert\n                    Grosseteste.In his
  commentary on the Posterior Analytics,\n                    Gros- seteste taught
  that the mind is\n                    capable of knowledge without the aid of the
  senses. Due to its\n                    incarceration in the body, however, the
  mind is darkened and re- quires the aid of sensation. Accordingly,\n                    abstraction
  of forms from the data of sensation is normally re- quired. So the intellect separates
  out for\n                    special con- sideration the features of\n                    things
  which are confused in sensation. Abstraction of forms usually is\n                    derived
  from many individual objects presented to the senses. But the\n                    knowledge
  thus attained is not of the highest grade.A representative view of the Franciscans
  can be found in Matthew of\n                    Aquasparta. Because the human soul
  is a sort of mean between God and\n                    creatures, it has two aspects,
  one of which, the superior part, is\n                    turned to God; the other,
  the inferior part, is turned toward creatures.\n                    According to
  the doctrine of “the two faces of the\n                    soul,” the correct explanation
  of human knowledge is a medium\n                    between the position of Augustine
  and Aristotle.Knowledge of the world is generated in man by sensation, memory, and\n
  \                   experience from which the universal concepts of art and science
  are\n                    derived. But in order fully to understand the natures of
  things thus\n                    abstracted from sensation we require an illumination
  from the Divine Light.\n                    Although we do not see Divine Light
  in our earthly existence, we see the\n                    natures of things by its
  means. The existence of this illumination is\n                    explained as follows:
  we know eternal truths with certainty. These truths\n                    are immutable
  yet everythingMatthew adopts the Augustinian theory that the corporeal world cannot\n
  \                   produce changes in the soul (the inferior cannot affect the
  superior).\n                    Rather the soul is actively aware of changes occurring
  anywhere in the\n                    body. The data which the soul makes from its
  notice of corporeal changes\n                    are rendered intelligible by the
  Agent Intellect which, Matthew says, is\n                    what Aristotle calls
  abstractions. But these\n                    abstractions are understood in the
  light of the immutable rules\n                    provided by divine illumination.
  This combination of “abstrac- tion” and illumination is\n                    to
  be found in a number of Franciscan thinkers of the thirteenth century.\n                        Saint
  Thomas Aquinas.\n                     Aquinas expounds a theory of abstraction according
  to which things\n                    (in the sense of objects of apprehension) can
  be considered, one\n                    aspect apart from another, in cases in which
  the two things cannot exist\n                    separated from one another. In
  cases in which one thing can exist apart\n                    from another we should
  speak of “separation” rather\n                    than abstraction (Commentary on
  Boethius' De\n                    Trinitate, Q5, a.3). Since substance, which is
  the intelligible matter\n                    of quantity, can exist without quantity,
  it is possible to consider\n                    substance without quantity. Again,
  to consider “ani- mal” without considering\n                    “stone” is not to
  abstractanimal from stone. Thus it is only\n                    in cases where things
  cannot exist separately but can be considered separately that we can properly speak
  of abstraction.Abstraction is of two kinds: the one, mathematical abstraction, involves
  a\n                    consideration of form from sen- sible matter.\n                    The
  other is the abstraction of the univer-\n                    sal from the particular.
  The possibility of abstraction depends on\n                    the fact that things
  (features of things) exist in one way in the realm of\n                    matter,
  but in another in an intellect which apprehends them. Thus, because\n                    the
  mind is immaterial, the natures of material things exist in the\n                    mind
  in a way suitable to the mind, i.e., they have an immaterial existence\n                    in
  the mind. But the simple apprehension of the mind does not involve\n                    any
  assertion that the features of things exist thus in reality,\n                    because
  simple apprehension is not an act which asserts or denies anything\n                    at
  all. The mathematical abstraction which considers only the quantitative\n                    features
  of phys- ical things does not assert\n                    that lines, planes, etc.,
  exist independently of such objects. It merely\n                    considers these
  features without attending to other aspects of\n                    physical objects,
  although the mathematical or quantitative features\n                    cannot exist
  isolated from physical objects.In the case of the abstraction of the universal from
  particulars, the mind\n                    considers the specific nature of, say,
  man or dog, apart from the\n                    individuating aspects\n                     of
  individual men or dogs. Again, abstrahentium\n                        non est mendacium
  (“abstraction is not\n                    falsification”) be- cause the mind\n                    does
  not assert that the specific nature of man can exist apart from\n                    particular
  men.The generic nature common to several species can be abstracted so that the\n
  \                   mind thinks only of the generic aspect of these several species
  and ignores\n                    the specific differences. “What is joined in reality,
  the\n                    intellect can at times receive separately, when one of
  the elements is not\n                    included in the notion of the other” (Summa\n
  \                       contra gentiles I, c. 54, para. 3). So, because the concept\n
  \                   of the genus “animal” does not explicitly contain the\n                    concept
  of, say, “rational,” the mind can consider\n                    “animal” without
  considering any particular kind of\n                    animal. But this “animal”
  is not something existing\n                    apart from particular kinds of animal
  any more than these particular kinds\n                    can exist apart from indi-
  vidual animals.\n                    Only in the mind that apprehends the form of
  animal stripped of its\n                    individuating and speci- fying\n                    characteristics
  does animal as such exist (ibid., I, c. 26, para. 5).Nothing exists in a genus which
  does not exist in some species of that genus\n                    (ibid., I, c.
  25, para. 2).Animal cannot exist in re without\n                    the differentia
  “ra-\n                    tional” or the differentia “irrational.”\n                    Still
  animal can be considered without these differentiae (ibid., I, c.\n                    26,
  para. 11). There is, however, no purely generic ex- emplar in the divine mind (Summa\n
  \                   theol. I, 15a. 3 ad 4).Duns Scotus adopted from Avicenna the
  doctrine of a common nature which is\n                    in itself neither one
  nor many but simply what is indicated in the\n                    definition or
  description of such a nature. This nature can be\n                    individuated
  in the individuals of a species by the further determination\n                    of
  an individual difference or “haecceity” (i.e.,\n                    “thisness” in
  contrast to\n                    “quiddity” or “whatness”), or\n                    it
  can be rendered a universal con- cept by the\n                    action of the
  active intellect; but in itself it is neither one nor many.The process of abstracting
  a universal concept from the common nature so\n                    conceived is
  not a “real action” because the common\n                    nature is already present
  in the individuals and formally distinguished\n                    from the indi-
  vidual differences prior to\n                    and independent of any action of
  the intellect (Duns Scotus, Quaestiones in metaphyisicorum libros, VII, q. 18;\n
  \                       Opus oxoniense II d. 1, q. 5 [q. 6], n. 5). This\n                    formal
  distinction of the specific nature from the individual differences\n                    which
  contract it to a numerical unity in the various individ- uals of the species applies
  just as\n                    well to the distinction between the specific and the
  generic features of\n                    a common nature, for these also are formally
  distinct in such a way\n                    that the mind can think of the generic
  nature as such. There is, therefore,\n                    no distortion or falsification
  in the result of abstraction, because abstrac-Thus, the distinctive feature of Scotus'
  contribution to the doctrine of\n                    abstraction depends upon his
  doc- trine of the\n                    formal distinction between the individu-\n
  \                   ating and the common nature which exists prior to any action
  of mind\n                    on the data of observation.\n                        William
  of Ockham.\n                     Ockham uses the term “abstrac-\n                        tion”
  and provides a number of meanings for it, but\n                    he departs from
  his predecessors on one very important point: he denies\n                    that
  we can think as separate what is incapable of existing separately in\n                    reality.
  However, he allows that we can understand one thing without\n                    understanding
  another at the same time even though the two things do, in\n                    fact,
  coexist. Thus he states “To abstract is to understand one\n                    thing
  without under- standing another at\n                    the same time even though
  in reality the one is not separated from the\n                    other, e.g., sometimes
  the intellect understands the whiteness which\n                    is in milk and
  does not understand the sweetness of milk. Abstraction in\n                    this
  sense can belong even to a sense, for a sense can apprehend one\n                    sensible
  without apprehending another” (Expositio physicorum, fol. 111c).In his commentary
  on the Sentences (II, qq. 14, 15\n                    xx) Ockham tells us that the
  abstraction of the agent intellect is twofold.\n                    On the one hand,
  it produces a thought (an intellection) which is either\n                    intuitive
  or abstractive, is wholly abstracted from matter because it\n                    is
  immaterial in itself, and has its existence in some- thing immaterial (i.e., in
  the soul). On the other\n                    hand, the abstraction produces a universal,
  i.e., a universal concept\n                    of a thing in representative existence.In
  still another sense, abstraction occurs when one predicable is predicated\n                    of
  a subject and another pre- dicable is not\n                    predicable of that
  subject even though the latter predicable applies to the\n                    subject.
  This takes place in mathematics. For the mathematician\n                    considers
  only such statements as “Every body is divisible, is\n                    so long
  and so deep,” and ignores statements about bodies\n                    which pertain
  to motion, to the composition of matter and form in physical\n                    things,
  etc.Accordingly, Ockham allows that many things are really distinct which\n                    constitute
  a unity, as in the case of matter and form, or substance and\n                    accident.
  Now it is true that, in such cases, the mind can separate or\n                    divide
  these from one another so as to understand one and not understand\n                    the
  other. But if a and b are\n                    one thing and a may not be really
  distinguished fromb, it is impossible that the mind may divide a fromb so as to
  understand either without understanding\n                    the other (Sent. I,
  d. 2, q. 3, H).Hence, Ockham rejects any abstraction of a common\n                     nature
  or form from its instances in such a way that the mind\n                    can
  contemplate the common nature as such. The only distinction Ockham will\n                    allow
  is the real distinction of one thing from another thing. A distinc- tion between
  the common nature and an\n                    individual difference which Scotus
  had defended is, for Ockham,\n                    entirely out of the question (Sent.
  I d, qq. 1-4).The reason why Ockham can allow the abstraction of matter and form
  in an\n                    individual physical object is because, for him, this
  matter and this form\n                    could exist apart from one another, at
  least by divine power. The same\n                    is true of accident and substance.
  An accident can be thought without its\n                    substratum because an
  accident and its substratum are two really\n                    distinct things,
  and one can exist without the other (Sent. II, q. 5, M; cf. I, d. 30, q. 1, P).Thus
  Ockham, as Vignaux observed, adopted the principle, much later\n                    exploited
  by Hume, that what- ever is\n                    distinguishable is separable. And
  like Hume, he practically rejected the\n                    distinction of reason.
  The result was a rejection of the central tenet of\n                    the classi-
  cal doctrine of abstraction, set\n                    forth by Aristotle and defended,
  in one form or another, by many of\n                    the scholastics of the twelfth
  and later centuries.\n                        Descartes.\n                     There
  were many elaborations of the Thomistic doctrine among the\n                    later
  scholastics of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries by Cajetan,\n                    Suarez,
  John of St. Thomas and others. Suarez in particular, was\n                    responsible
  for sharpening the differences between abstraction and\n                    distinction
  (or “separation” as Saint Thomas had\n                    called it). And this,
  in turn, was almost certainly the immediate source of\n                    Descartes'
  views.While Descartes allows that abstraction takes place in the mind, he is\n                    always
  at pains to notice that abstrac- tion\n                    renders our concepts
  inadequate in such a way that we cannot discover the\n                    important
  distinction of things. Thus, the distinction of reason by which\n                    a
  substance is distinguished from its principal attribute (of thought\n                    or
  extension as the case may be) is effected by abstracting one from the\n                    other.
  This is accomplished only with some difficulty and the result does\n                    not
  corre- spond with anything in the way of\n                    a real separation
  of a substance from its nature or attribute (Principles of Philosophy, I, 63). Thus
  the valuable\n                    operation of the mind is that which provides us
  with a real distinc- tion. This Descartes sometimes calls\n                    “exclusion.”
  The principal difference which Descartes\n                    makes between abstraction
  and exclusion is that, in the case of abstrac- tion we consider one thing without\n
  \                   considering that from which abstraction has been made and so
  may not\n                    be aware that abstraction has rendered a concept in-\n
  \                       adequate, whereas in distinguishing one thing\n                    from
  another, we must keep both clearly before us. Consid- ering an abstraction by itself
  prevents us from knowingThe influence of Descartes on the so-called Port-\n                        Royal
  Logic of Antoine Arnauld (1612-94) is obvious. But this\n                    famous
  treatise presents an account of abstrac-\n                        tion which agrees
  in essential features with the stand- ard medieval view. Arnauld had argued, in
  his\n                    critique of Descartes, that the genus can be conceived
  without\n                    conceiving its species so that, for example, one can
  conceive figure\n                    without conceiving any of the charac-\n                    teristics
  proper to such a particular figure as a circle\n                    (“Fourth Objections”).
  Again, length can be conceived\n                    without breadth or depth. But
  such abstraction, prop-\n                        erly so-called, is only between
  aspects of things which are only\n                    distinct by a distinction
  of reason. Where things really distinct are\n                    distinguished,
  abstraction does not occur (La Logique\n                        ou l'art de penser
  [1662], Part I, Ch. 5).\n                        John Locke.\n                     The
  discussion of abstraction which is perhaps most familiar to\n                    modern
  readers is to be found in Locke's Essay Concerning\n                        Human
  Understanding.Words become general by being made the signs of general ideas; and\n
  \                           ideas become general by separating from them the circumstances
  of\n                            time and place, and any other ideas that may determine
  them to this\n                            or that particular existence. By this
  way of abstraction they are\n                            made capable of repre-
  senting more\n                            individuals than one; each of which having
  in it a conformity to\n                            that abstract idea, is (as we
  call it) of that sort\n                        (Book III, Ch. 3, para. 6).\n                    He
  goes on to suggest immediately that nothing new is introduced in this\n                    process
  but that it is rather a process of omitting all individuating\n                    features,
  and re- taining only what is common\n                    to all of a set of resem-
  bling particulars.\n                    This omission, he explains elsewhere (Book
  II, Ch. 13, para. 13), is a kind\n                    of partial consid- eration
  which does not\n                    imply a separation. But Locke applies the notion
  of abstraction to cases\n                    which go beyond the mere omission of
  particular spatiotemporal\n                    determinations. In the famous example
  of forming the general idea of a\n                    triangle, Locke says that
  this idea of triangle in general is\n                    “something imperfect that
  cannot exist, an idea wherein some\n                    parts of several different
  and inconsistent ideas are put\n                    together” (Book IV, Ch. 7, para.
  9). Whatever Locke may have\n                    thought this “putting together”
  amounted to, it is\n                    certainly not achieved simply by omitting
  particularizing features of\n                    several particular triangles. The
  fact is that no single doctrine of\n                    abstraction can be found
  in Locke, as I. A. Aaron has shown (Aaron, 1937).\n                        Berkeley
  and Hume.\n                     Berkeley's critique of abstrac- tion\n                    proceeds
  along lines which were relatively new to his readers but which had\n                    already
  been worked out by Al-Ghazali in the eleventh century and even\n                    by
  Ockham in the fourteenth century. If two things (in\n                     Berkeley's
  philosophy, of course, two ideas) can exist\n                    separately, the
  mind can abstract one from the other. But if it is granted\n                    that
  two things cannot exist one apart from the other, i.e., that there\n                    would
  be a con- tradiction if a were supposed to exist without b\n                    (or
  conversely), the mind cannot think of a without\n                        b or of
  b without a. To argue otherwise would be to attrib- ute to the human mind a power
  which not even God\n                    can be supposed to have or exercise.Hume
  adopted Berkeley's critique and elaborated a positive theory of the\n                    function
  of general terms which goes beyond Berkeley. Although every idea\n                    is
  particu- lar, some ideas can function as\n                    general ones by being
  associated with a name of a number of\n                    particulars which resemble
  one another exactly or only approxi- mately. In the latter case, the\n                    name
  is associated with a number of qualitatively different but\n                    resembling
  images. One of these associated images will be domi- nant, the others relatively
  recessive but,\n                    as Hume puts it, “present in power to be recalled
  by design or\n                        neces- sity.” Thus, although a\n                    red
  image may be recalled when the word “color” is\n                    pronounced,
  heard, read, or re- called, other\n                    color-images less strongly
  associated with the word\n                    “color” tend to appear in consciousness,
  are\n                    “present in power,” and will be recalled if there is\n
  \                   danger of a mistakenly narrow use of “color” present- ing itself.
  This then, is Hume's\n                    alternative to the doc- trine that there
  are\n                    either genuine images or abstract general ideas. The traditional\n
  \                   explanation of the ori- gin of abstract concepts\n                    persisted,
  with some modi- fications,\n                    among the philosophers of the eighteenth
  century.A considerable advance in the understanding of the nature and function of\n
  \                   concepts seems to have been made by Immanuel Kant. The verb,
  adjective, and\n                    noun frequently occur in Kant's Critique of
  Pure\n                    Reason (Werke, A54, A70 [B95], A76, A96)\n                    without
  any special explanation. But Kant's doctrine of pure as well as a posteriori concepts
  leaves no doubt that\n                    abstraction alone cannot account for the
  existence or employment of\n                    concepts (Werke, VII, 400-01). “The
  form of\n                    a concept, as a discursive representation is always
  con- structed.” As Kant puts it in the Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics (para.
  20),\n                    empirical concepts would not be possible unless a pure
  concept were\n                    added to the particular concept which has been
  ab-\n                        stracted from intuition. And, finally, in the Critique
  of Pure Reason, the concept is presented as a rule by means of which the imagination
  can outline,\n                    for exam- ple, the figure of a certain quadruped\n
  \                   (say, a dog) without limiting it to such a\n                    determinate
  figure as one's experience or concrete images might present.\n                    Kant
  calls this a schema. Without such a schema (which is an\n                    application
  of the pure concepts of the under-Kant's doctrine that pure concepts, i.e., the
  cate-\n                        gories of the understanding, be at the basis of all
  con- ceptual thinking thus makes the process of\n                    abstraction
  subsidiary to and dependent upon faculties which are\n                    logically
  prior to any process of abstraction from em- pirical data. As more than one writer
  has recently\n                    pointed out, empirical concepts are more like
  disposi- tions than like static constituents of\n                    consciousness.
  There is, however, no suggestion in Kant that abstrac- tion does not occur. That
  this new\n                    view of the activities of the mind would require an
  entirely different\n                    account of abstraction is not made very
  plain in Kant's writings.In the development of metaphysical Idealism in the post-Kantian\n
  \                   philosophers, the notion of abstraction becomes very general,
  so general in\n                    fact that the origi- nal meanings of the term\n
  \                   seem almost lost. What makes the matter even more difficult
  to discuss is\n                    the fact that, among these Idealists, any separation
  or isolation of\n                    one content or feature of experience or thought
  from another is condemned\n                    as falsification, so that “to ab-\n
  \                   stract,” “abstract,”\n                    “abstraction,” all
  acquire a pejora- tive sense. To separate the cognizing subject from\n                    its
  object, to attend to one discriminable element apart from its\n                    surrounding,
  and the like, are all condemned as falsifications of reality.\n                    This
  condemnation rests on the Hegelian doctrine that “the Truth\n                    is
  the Whole,” i.e., that all aspects of thought and reality are\n                        dialecti-
  cally interconnected.Other more significant attacks on the doctrine that general
  concepts result\n                    from abstraction come from Husserl's thorough
  critique of Locke and his\n                        eight- eenth-century critics.\n
  \                   While insisting on the absurdity of Locke's doctrine, Husserl
  attacked with\n                    equal vehe- mence the theories of Berkeley,\n
  \                   Hume, and Mill. He insisted that the general attributes are
  given to con- sciousness initially, and thus\n                    repudiated the
  traditional doctrine of abstraction. There are similar views\n                    to
  be found in some of the writings of Whitehead and San- tayana. The “eternal objects”
  of\n                    Whitehead and the “essences” of Santayana are\n                    supposed
  to be discoveries rather than constructions; they are not the\n                    results
  of creations of mental activities, and thus are not the result\n                    of
  abstraction as it was traditionally expounded, although the accounts of\n                    abstraction
  in terms of atten- tion and\n                    comparisons would be consistent
  with such views.One of the most significant critiques of abstraction comes from
  Gottlob\n                    Frege, in his Grundlagen der Arithmetik\n                    (1884).
  While Frege appears to allow that “color, weight, and\n                    hardness”
  are abstracted from ob-\n                    jects, he holds that number is not
  so abstracted.\n                    His theory of the concept of cardinal number
  makes it\n                     impossible to obtain the number concept by simply
  omitting\n                    features of empirically accessible objects. Because
  a number is a\n                    “property” of properties, it is not available
  from\n                    empirical inspection of individuals. And if we examine
  Frege's definitions\n                    of particular finite cardinals we see at
  once why the notion of cardi- nal numbers can hardly be extracted as\n                    traditional
  abstraction doctrines suggest. The number one, for\n                    example,
  is a characteristic of any “property F”\n                    which satisfies the
  following condition: there is that which is F and which is the same as anything
  which is F, more exactly: (∃x)(Fx(y)(Fy. ⊃. y = x). It is readily seen, if we remove
  the expression\n                        “F” from the above formula\n                    thus
  obtaining (∃x). (–x. (y) –y. ∃. y = x, that the property of F is\n                    expressible
  solely in terms of logical constants. Now because these\n                    constants
  function in discourse in a manner that is not compara- ble with the way indicative
  or\n                    descriptive expressions function, it is hardly surprising
  that there is\n                    nothing available empirically from which they
  can be ab- stracted or upon which attention may be concentrated.\n                    A
  psychological account of the origin of the notion of number will\n                    doubtless
  be a very complicated affair but it will necessarily be radically\n                    different
  from ab-\n                        straction.The technique employed by Frege, Georg
  Cantor, and some others to elucidate\n                    the mathematical notions
  of cardinal number was recognized by Bertrand\n                    Russell as an
  application of a general principle which Russell called\n                    “the
  principle of abstraction.” But he added that it\n                    would have
  been better called the principle “for the avoidance\n                    of abstraction.”
  The principle is this: for any relation S which is transitive and symmetrical there
  is a\n                    relation R which is a many-one relation such that\n                    whenever
  xSy, there is a unique term z such that xRz and yRz; conversely, if there is a many-one
  relationR such that there is a unique term z so that xRz andyRz, there is a relation
  S which\n                    is transitive and sym- metrical (Principia Mathematica,
  Vol. 1, °72).The essential principle to notice here is that, instead of attempting
  to\n                    account for the concept by a psycho-\n                    logical
  theory by which the concept is derived some- how from the data of the senses or
  from some innate\n                    or at least internal feature of human consciousness,
  the concept is\n                    constructed by logical means from fairly simple
  relational concepts. Thus,\n                    a cardinal number is defined as
  either a class of those classes whose num- bers can be bi-uniquely correlated (in
  a one\n                    to one correspondence) with one another, or, as a propertyP
  of those properties q1, q2,..., qr such that those\n                    things having
  any one of these properties can be corre- lated bi-uniquely with the things having
  any other\n                    of these properties.The formal definition of cardinal
  number brings intoFor main developments in Greek thought, see J. I. Beare,Greek
