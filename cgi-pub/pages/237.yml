  Science[nb 1] is a systematic enterprise that creates, builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.[nb 2][2]:58
- |
  Contemporary science is typically subdivided into the natural sciences which study the material world, the social sciences which study people and societies, and the formal sciences like mathematics. The formal sciences are often excluded as they do not depend on empirical observations.[3] Disciplines which use science like engineering and medicine may also be considered to be applied sciences.[4]
- |
  From classical antiquity through the 19th century, science as a type of knowledge was more closely linked to philosophy than it is now and, in fact, in the West the term "natural philosophy" encompassed fields of study that are today associated with science such as physics, astronomy, medicine, among many others.[5]:3[nb 3]
- |
  In the 17th and 18th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of laws of nature. Over the course of the 19th century, the word "science" became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself, as a disciplined way to study the natural world. It was in the 19th century that modern scientific disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and biology reached their modern shapes. The same time period also included the origin of the terms "scientist" and "scientific community," the founding of scientific institutions, and increasing significance of the interactions with society and other aspects of culture.[6][7]

  Science in a broad sense existed before the modern era, and in many historical civilizations.[nb 4]Modern science is distinct in its approach and successful in its results: 'modern science' now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term.[8]
- |
  Science in its original sense is a word for a type of knowledge, rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge. In particular it is one of the types of knowledge which people can communicate to each other and share. For example, knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and led to the development of complex abstract thinking. This is shown by the construction of complex calendars, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, and buildings such as the pyramids. However no consistent conscientious distinction was made between knowledge of such things which are true in every community and other types of communal knowledge, such as mythologies and legal systems.

  Before the invention or discovery of the concept of "nature" (Ancient Greek phusis), by the Pre-Socratic philosophers, the same words tend to be used to describe the natural "way" in which a plant grows,[9] and the "way" in which, for example, one tribe worships a particular god. For this reason it is claimed these men were the first philosophers in the strict sense, and also the first people to clearly distinguish "nature" and "convention".[10] Science was therefore distinguished as the knowledge of nature, and the things which are true for every community, and the name of the specialized pursuit of such knowledge was philosophy — the realm of the first philosopher-physicists. They were mainly speculators or theorists, particularly interested in astronomy. In contrast, trying to use knowledge of nature to imitate nature (artifice or technology, Greek technē) was seen by classical scientists as a more appropriate interest for lower class artisans.[11] A clear-cut distinction between formal (eon) and empirical science (doxa) was made by pre-Socratic philosopher Parmenides (fl. late sixth or early fifth century BCE). Although his work peri physeos is a poem, it may be viewed as an epistemological essay, an essay on method in natural science. Parmenides' ἐὸν may refer to a formal system, a calculus which can describe nature more precisely than natural languages. 'Physis' may be identical to ἐὸν.[12]

  A major turning point in the history of early philosophical science was the controversial but successful attempt by Socrates to apply philosophy to the study of human things, including human nature, the nature of political communities, and human knowledge itself. He criticized the older type of study of physics as too purely speculative, and lacking in self-criticism. He was particularly concerned that some of the early physicists treated nature as if it could be assumed that it had no intelligent order, explaining things merely in terms of motion and matter. The study of human things had been the realm of mythology and tradition, and Socrates was executed.[14]Aristotle later created a less controversial systematic programme of Socratic philosophy, which was teleological, and human-centred. He rejected many of the conclusions of earlier scientists. For example, in his physics the sun goes around the earth, and many things have it as part of their nature that they are for humans. Each thing has a formal cause and final cause and a role in the rational cosmic order. Motion and change is described as the actualization of potentials already in things, according to what types of things they are. While the Socratics insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being (a study Aristotle divided into ethics and political philosophy), they did not argue for any other types of applied science.
- |
  Aristotle maintained the sharp distinction between science and the practical knowledge of artisans, treating theoretical speculation as the highest type of human activity, practical thinking about good living as something less lofty, and the knowledge of artisans as something only suitable for the lower classes. In contrast to modern science, Aristotle's influential emphasis was upon the "theoretical" steps of deducing universal rules from raw data, and did not treat the gathering of experience and raw data as part of science itself.[nb 5]

  During late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, the Aristotelian approach to inquiries on natural phenomena was used. Some ancient knowledge was lost, or in some cases kept in obscurity, during the fall of the Roman Empire and periodic political struggles. However, the general fields of science, or "natural philosophy" as it was called, and much of the general knowledge from the ancient world remained preserved though the works of the early Latin encyclopedists like Isidore of Seville. Also, in the Byzantine empire, many Greek science texts were preserved in Syriac translations done by groups such as Nestorians and Monophysites.[17] Many of these were translated later on into Arabic under the Caliphate, during which many types of classical learning were preserved and in some cases improved upon.[17][nb 7] The House of Wisdom was established in Abbasid-era Baghdad, Iraq.[18] It is considered to have been a major intellectual center, during the Islamic Golden Age, where Muslim scholars such as al-Kindi and Ibn Sahl in Baghdad, and Ibn al-Haytham in Cairo, flourished from the ninth to the thirteenth centuries, until the Mongol sack of Baghdad. Ibn al-Haytham, known later to the West as Alhazen, furthered the Aristotelian viewpoint,[19] by emphasizing experimental data.[nb 8][20] In the later medieval period, as demand for translations grew, for example from the Toledo School of Translators, Western Europeans began collecting texts written not only in Latin, but also Latin translations from Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew. The texts of Aristotle, Ptolemy,[nb 9] and Euclid, preserved in the Houses of Wisdom, were sought amongst Catholic scholars. In Europe, Alhazen's De Aspectibus directly influenced Roger Bacon (13th century) in England, who argued for more experimental science, as demonstrated by Alhazen. By the late Middle Ages, a synthesis of Catholicism and Aristotelianism known as Scholasticism was flourishing in Western Europe, which had become a new geographic center of science, but all aspects of scholasticism were criticized in the 15th and 16th centuries.

  Medieval science carried on the views of the Hellenist civilization of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, as shown by Alhazen's lost work A Book in which I have Summarized the Science of Optics from the Two Books of Euclid and Ptolemy, to which I have added the Notions of the First Discourse which is Missing from Ptolemy's Book from Ibn Abi Usaibia's catalog, as cited in (Smith 2001).:91(vol.1),p.xv Alhazen conclusively disproved Ptolemy's theory of vision.

  But Alhacen retained Aristotle's ontology; Roger Bacon, Witelo, and John Peckham each built-up a scholastic ontology upon Alhazen's Book of Optics, a causal chain beginning with sensation, perception, and finally apperception of the individual and universal forms of Aristotle.[21] This model of vision became known as Perspectivism, which was exploited and studied by the artists of the Renaissance.
- |
  A. Mark Smith points out the perspectivist theory of vision "is remarkably economical, reasonable, and coherent", which pivots on three of Aristotle's four causes, formal, material, and final.[22] Although Alhacen knew that a scene imaged through an aperture is inverted, he argued that vision is about perception. This was overturned by Kepler,[23]:p.102 who modelled the eye with a water-filled glass sphere, with an aperture in front of it to model the entrance pupil. He found that all the light from a single point of the scene was imaged at a single point at the back of the glass sphere. The optical chain ends on the retina at the back of the eye and the image is inverted.[nb 10]

  Galileo Galilei, father of modern science.[24]

  Galileo made innovative use of experiment and mathematics. However his persecution began after Pope Urban VIII blessed Galileo to write about the Copernican system. Galileo had used arguments from the Pope and put them in the voice of the simpleton in the work "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems" which caused great offense to him.[25]
- |
  In Northern Europe, the new technology of the printing press was widely used to publish many arguments including some that disagreed with church dogma. René Descartes and Francis Bacon published philosophical arguments in favor of a new type of non-Aristotelian science. Descartes argued that mathematics could be used in order to study nature, as Galileo had done, and Bacon emphasized the importance of experiment over contemplation. Bacon questioned the Aristotelian concepts of formal cause and final cause, and promoted the idea that science should study the laws of "simple" natures, such as heat, rather than assuming that there is any specific nature, or "formal cause", of each complex type of thing. This new modern science began to see itself as describing "laws of nature". This updated approach to studies in nature was seen as mechanistic. Bacon also argued that science should aim for the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all human life.

  In the 17th and 18th centuries, the project of modernity, as had been promoted by Bacon and Descartes, led to rapid scientific advance and the successful development of a new type of natural science, mathematical, methodically experimental, and deliberately innovative. Newton and Leibniz succeeded in developing a new physics, now referred to as Newtonian physics, which could be confirmed by experiment and explained using mathematics. Leibniz also incorporated terms from Aristotelian physics, but now being used in a new non-teleological way, for example "energy" and "potential" (modern versions of Aristotelian "energeia and potentia"). In the style of Bacon, he assumed that different types of things all work according to the same general laws of nature, with no special formal or final causes for each type of thing. It is during this period that the word "science" gradually became more commonly used to refer to a type of pursuit of a type of knowledge, especially knowledge of nature — coming close in meaning to the old term "natural philosophy".

  Both John Herschel and William Whewell systematized methodology: the latter coined the term scientist. When Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species he established descent with modification as the prevailing evolutionary explanation of biological complexity. His theory of natural selection provided a natural explanation of how species originated, but this only gained wide acceptance a century later. John Dalton developed the idea of atoms. The laws of thermodynamics and the electromagnetic theory were also established in the 19th century, which raised new questions which could not easily be answered using Newton's framework. The phenomena that would allow the deconstruction of the atom were discovered in the last decade of the 19th century: the discovery of X-rays inspired the discovery of radioactivity. In the next year came the discovery of the first subatomic particle, the electron.

At the same time, the structure of the atom and its nucleus was elucidated, leading to the release of "atomic energy" (nuclear power). In addition, the extensive use of scientific innovation, stimulated by the wars of this century, led to antibiotics and increased life expectancy, revolutions in transportation (automobiles and aircraft), and the development of ICBMs, a space race, and a nuclear arms race— all giving a widespread public appreciation of the importance of modern science.

  The scientific method
- |
  Main article: Scientific method
- |
  The scientific method seeks to explain the events of nature in a reproducible way.[nb 11] An explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis is put forward, as explanation, using principles such as parsimony (also known as "Occam's Razor") and are generally expected to seek consilience—fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena.[2][dubious – discuss] This new explanation is used to make falsifiable predictions that are testable by experiment or observation. The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought, as proof that no tampering has occurred. Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress.[nb 12][nb 13] This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena, but also through experimentation, that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions, as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences, such as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment). Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish causal relationships (to avoid the correlation fallacy).

  When a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory, it is either modified or discarded.[26] If the hypothesis survived testing, it may become adopted into the framework of a scientific theory. This is a logically reasoned, self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena. A theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis; commonly, a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory. Thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses. In that vein, theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses. In addition to testing hypotheses, scientists may also generate a model based on observed phenomena. This is an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical, physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested.[27]
- |
  While performing experiments to test hypotheses, scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another, and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias.[28][29] This can be achieved by careful experimental design, transparency, and a thorough peer review process of the experimental results as well as any conclusions.[30][31] After the results of an experiment are announced or published, it is normal practice for independent researchers to double-check how the research was performed, and to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results might be.[32] Taken in its entirety, the scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective bias on the part of its users (namely the confirmation bias).[33]

  Mathematics and formal sciences
- |
  Main article: Mathematics
- |
  Mathematics is essential to the sciences. One important function of mathematics in science is the role it plays in the expression of scientific models. Observing and collecting measurements, as well as hypothesizing and predicting, often require extensive use of mathematics. Arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry and calculus, for example, are all essential to physics. Virtually every branch of mathematics has applications in science, including "pure" areas such as number theory and topology.
- |
  Statistical methods, which are mathematical techniques for summarizing and analyzing data, allow scientists to assess the level of reliability and the range of variation in experimental results. Statistical analysis plays a fundamental role in many areas of both the natural sciences and social sciences.
- |
  Computational science applies computing power to simulate real-world situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve. According to the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge.[34]
- |
  Whether mathematics itself is properly classified as science has been a matter of some debate. Some thinkers see mathematicians as scientists, regarding physical experiments as inessential or mathematical proofs as equivalent to experiments. Others do not see mathematics as a science, since it does not require an experimental test of its theories and hypotheses. Mathematical theorems and formulas are obtained by logical derivations which presume axiomatic systems, rather than the combination of empirical observation and logical reasoning that has come to be known as the scientific method. In general, mathematics is classified as formal science, while natural and social sciences are classified as empirical sciences.[35]

  Scientific fields are commonly divided into two major groups: natural sciences, which study natural phenomena (including biological life), and social sciences, which study human behavior and societies. These groupings are empirical sciences, which means the knowledge must be based on observable phenomena and capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions.[36] There are also related disciplines that are grouped into interdisciplinary applied sciences, such as engineering and medicine. Within these categories are specialized scientific fields that can include parts of other scientific disciplines but often possess their own nomenclature and expertise.[37]
- |
  Mathematics, which is classified as a formal science,[38][39] has both similarities and differences with the empirical sciences (the natural and social sciences). It is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using a priori rather than empirical methods.[40] The formal sciences, which also include statistics and logic, are vital to the empirical sciences. Major advances in formal science have often led to major advances in the empirical sciences. The formal sciences are essential in the formation of hypotheses, theories, and laws,[41] both in discovering and describing how things work (natural sciences) and how people think and act (social sciences).
- |
  Apart from its broad meaning, the word "Science" sometimes may specifically refer to fundamental sciences (maths and natural sciences) alone. Science schools or faculties within many institutions are separate from those for medicine or engineering, which is an applied science.
- |
  Institutions
- |
  Learned societies for the communication and promotion of scientific thought and experimentation have existed since the Renaissance period.[42] The oldest surviving institution is the Italian Accademia dei Lincei which was established in 1603.[43] The respective National Academies of Science are distinguished institutions that exist in a number of countries, beginning with the British Royal Society in 1660[44] and the French Académie des Sciences in 1666.[45]
- |
  International scientific organizations, such as the International Council for Science, have since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations. Many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research. Prominent scientific organizations include, the National Science Foundation in the U.S., the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina, the academies of science of many nations, CSIRO in Australia, Centre national de la recherche scientifique in France, Max Planck Society and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft in Germany, and in Spain, CSIC.

  Literature
- |
  Main article: Scientific literature
- |
  An enormous range of scientific literature is published.[46]Scientific journals communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions, serving as an archival record of science. The first scientific journals, Journal des Sçavans followed by the Philosophical Transactions, began publication in 1665. Since that time the total number of active periodicals has steadily increased. In 1981, one estimate for the number of scientific and technical journals in publication was 11,500.[47] The United States National Library of Medicine currently indexes 5,516 journals that contain articles on topics related to the life sciences. Although the journals are in 39 languages, 91 percent of the indexed articles are published in English.[48]
- |
  Most scientific journals cover a single scientific field and publish the research within that field; the research is normally expressed in the form of a scientific paper. Science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements, news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace.
- |
  Science magazines such as New Scientist, Science & Vie, and Scientific American cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas of research, including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research. Science books engage the interest of many more people. Tangentially, the science fiction genre, primarily fantastic in nature, engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas, if not the methods, of science.
- |
  Recent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non-scientific disciplines such as Literature or, more specifically, Poetry, include the Creative Writing Science resource developed through the Royal Literary Fund.[49]

  Women in science
- |
  Main article: Women in science
- |
  Science has traditionally been a male-dominated field, with some notable exceptions.[nb 14] Women historically faced considerable discrimination in science, much as they did in other areas of male-dominated societies, such as frequently being passed over for job opportunities and denied credit for their work.[nb 15] For example, Christine Ladd (1847–1930) was able to enter a Ph.D. program as 'C. Ladd'; Christine "Kitty" Ladd completed the requirements in 1882, but was awarded her degree only in 1926, after a career which spanned the algebra of logic (see truth table), color vision, and psychology. Her work preceded notable researchers like Ludwig Wittgenstein and Charles Sanders Peirce. The achievements of women in science have been attributed to their defiance of their traditional role as laborers within the domestic sphere.[50]
- |
  In the late 20th century, active recruitment of women and elimination of institutional discrimination on the basis of sex greatly increased the number of female scientists, but large gender disparities remain in some fields; over half of new biologists are female, while 80% of PhDs in physics are given to men. Feminists claim this is the result of culture rather than an innate difference between the sexes, and some experiments have shown that parents challenge and explain more to boys than girls, asking them to reflect more deeply and logically.[51] In the early part of the 21st century, in America, women earned 50.3% bachelor's degrees, 45.6% master's degrees, and 40.7% of PhDs in science and engineering fields with women earning more than half of the degrees in three fields: Psychology (about 70%), Social Sciences (about 50%), and Biology (about 50-60%). However, when it comes to the Physical Sciences, Geosciences, Math, Engineering, and Computer Science; women earned less than half the degrees.[52] However, lifestyle choice also plays a major role in female engagement in science; women with young children are 28% less likely to take tenure-track positions due to work-life balance issues,[53] and female graduate students' interest in careers in research declines dramatically over the course of graduate school, whereas that of their male colleagues remains unchanged.[54]

  Science policy is an area of public policy concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise, including research funding, often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring. Science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies. Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences. In accordance with public policy being concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public.
- |
  State policy has influenced the funding of public works and science for thousands of years, dating at least from the time of the Mohists, who inspired the study of logic during the period of the Hundred Schools of Thought, and the study of defensive fortifications during the Warring States period in China. In Great Britain, governmental approval of the Royal Society in the 17th century recognized a scientific community which exists to this day. The professionalization of science, begun in the 19th century, was partly enabled by the creation of scientific organizations such as the National Academy of Sciences, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, and State funding of universities of their respective nations. Public policy can directly affect the funding of capital equipment, intellectual infrastructure for industrial research, by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund research. Vannevar Bush, director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development for the United States government, the forerunner of the National Science Foundation, wrote in July 1945 that "Science is a proper concern of government".[55]

  Science and technology research is often funded through a competitive process, in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations or foundations, allocate scarce funds. Total research funding in most developed countries is between 1.5% and 3% of GDP.[56] In the OECD, around two-thirds of research and development in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 20% and 10% respectively by universities and government. The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and it dominates research in social science and humanities. Similarly, with some exceptions (e.g. biotechnology) government provides the bulk of the funds for basic scientific research. In commercial research and development, all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation possibilities rather than "blue-sky" ideas or technologies (such as nuclear fusion).

  Media perspectives
- |
  The mass media face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate may require considerable expertise regarding the matter.[57] Few journalists have real scientific knowledge, and even beat reporters who know a great deal about certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific issues that they are suddenly asked to cover.[58][59]
- |
  Political usage
- |
  See also: Politicization of science
- |
  Many issues damage the relationship of science to the media and the use of science and scientific arguments by politicians. As a very broad generalisation, many politicians seek certainties and facts whilst scientists typically offer probabilities and caveats. However, politicians' ability to be heard in the mass media frequently distorts the scientific understanding by the public. Examples in Britain include the controversy over the MMR inoculation, and the 1988 forced resignation of a Government Minister, Edwina Currie for revealing the high probability that battery farmed eggs were contaminated with Salmonella.[60]

  John Horgan, Chris Mooney, and researchers from the US and Canada have described Scientific Certainty Argumentation Methods (SCAMs), where an organization or think tank makes it their only goal to cast doubt on supported science because it conflicts with political agendas.[61][62][63][64] Hank Campbell and microbiologist Alex Berezow have described "feel-good fallacies" used in politics, where politicians frame their positions in a way that makes people feel good about supporting certain policies even when scientific evidence shows there is no need to worry or there is no need for dramatic change on current programs.[65]

  Various activities are developed to approximate the general public and science/scientists, such as in science outreach, public awareness of science, science communication, science festivals, citizen science, science journalism, public science, popular science, etc.; see Science and the public for related concepts.

  The following text needs to be harmonized with text in Philosophy of science. (February 2014)
- |
  Working scientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method: (1) that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers; (2) that this objective reality is governed by natural laws; (3) that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation.[8] Philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid.
- |
  The belief that scientific theories should and do represent metaphysical reality is known as realism. It can be contrasted with anti-realism, the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as electrons. One form of anti-realism is idealism, the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence, and that each mind generates its own reality.[nb 16] In an idealistic world view, what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds.

  There are different schools of thought in philosophy of science. The most popular position is empiricism,[nb 17] which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations.[66] Empiricism generally encompasses inductivism, a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories. This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using deductive logic only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being bayesianism[67] and the hypothetico-deductive method.[68]:p236
- |
  Empiricism has stood in contrast to rationalism, the position originally associated with Descartes, which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation.[68]:p20Critical rationalism is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper. Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it.[68]:pp63–7 Popper proposed replacing verifiability with falsifiability as the landmark of scientific theories, and replacing induction with falsification as the empirical method.[68]:p68 Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism, trial and error.[69] It covers all products of the human mind, including science, mathematics, philosophy, and art.[70]
- |
  Another approach, instrumentalism, colloquially termed "shut up and calculate", emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena.[71] It views scientific theories as black boxes with only their input (initial conditions) and output (predictions) being relevant. Consequences, theoretical entities and logical structure are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn't make a fuss about (see interpretations of quantum mechanics). Close to instrumentalism is constructive empiricism, according to which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true.
- |
  Paul K Feyerabend advanced the idea of epistemological anarchism, which holds that there are no useful and exception-free methodological rules governing the progress of science or the growth of knowledge, and that the idea that science can or should operate according to universal and fixed rules is unrealistic, pernicious and detrimental to science itself.[72] Feyerabend advocates treating science as an ideology alongside others such as religion, magic and mythology, and considers the dominance of science in society authoritarian and unjustified. He also contended (along with Imre Lakatos)[discuss] that the demarcation problem of distinguishing science from pseudoscience on objective grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according to fixed, universal rules.[72] Feyerabend also stated that science does not have evidence for its philosophical precepts, particularly the notion of Uniformity of Law and the Uniformity of Process across time and space.[73]
- |
  Finally, another approach often cited in debates of scientific skepticism against controversial movements like "scientific creationism", is methodological naturalism. Its main point is that a difference between natural and supernatural explanations should be made, and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations.[nb 18] That the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not claim them to be wrong either. Instead, supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief outside the scope of science. Methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to empirical study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for observable phenomena.[74] The absence of these standards, arguments from authority, biased observational studies and other common fallacies are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non-science they criticize.

  A scientific theory is empirical,[nb 17][75] and is always open to falsification if new evidence is presented. That is, no theory is ever considered strictly certain as science accepts the concept of fallibilism.[nb 19] The philosopher of science Karl Popper sharply distinguishes truth from certainty. He writes that scientific knowledge "consists in the search for truth", but it "is not the search for certainty ... All human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain."[76]:p4
- |
  New scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding. According to psychologist Keith Stanovich, it may be the media's overuse of words like "breakthrough" that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false.[77]:119–138 While there are such famous cases as the theory of relativity that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions. Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments, by various researchers, across different branches of science; it is more like a climb than a leap.[77]:123 Theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community.[nb 20] For example, heliocentric theory, the theory of evolution, relativity theory, and germ theory still bear the name "theory" even though, in practice, they are considered factual.[78] Philosopher Barry Stroud adds that, although the best definition for "knowledge" is contested, being skeptical and entertaining the possibility that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct. Ironically then, the scientist adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess the truth.[79] The fallibilist C. S. Peirce argued that inquiry is the struggle to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome, verbal, or hyperbolic doubt is fruitless[80]—but also that the inquirer should try to attain genuine doubt rather than resting uncritically on common sense.[81] He held that the successful sciences trust, not to any single chain of inference (no stronger than its weakest link), but to the cable of multiple and various arguments intimately connected.[82]
- |
  Stanovich also asserts that science avoids searching for a "magic bullet"; it avoids the single-cause fallacy. This means a scientist would not ask merely "What is the cause of ...", but rather "What are the most significant causes of ...". This is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science (e.g. psychology, cosmology).[77]:141–147 Of course, research often analyzes few factors at once, but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider.[77]:141–147 For example: knowing the details of only a person's genetics, or their history and upbringing, or the current situation may not explain a behaviour, but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive.
- |
  Fringe science, pseudoscience and junk science
- |
  An area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes referred to as pseudoscience, fringe science, or junk science.[nb 21] Physicist Richard Feynman coined the term "cargo cult science" for cases in which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities have the outward appearance of science but actually lack the "kind of utter honesty" that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated.[83] Various types of commercial advertising, ranging from hype to fraud, may fall into these categories.
- |
  There also can be[discuss] an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of scientific debates.[citation needed] Sometimes, research may be characterized as "bad science", research that may be well-intentioned but is actually incorrect, obsolete, incomplete, or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas. The term "scientific misconduct" refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person.[84]

  Although encyclopedias such as Pliny (fl. 77 AD) Natural History offered purported fact, they proved unreliable. A skeptical point of view, demanding a method of proof, was the practical position taken to deal with unreliable knowledge. As early as 1000 years ago, scholars such as Alhazen (Doubts Concerning Ptolemy), Roger Bacon, Witelo, John Pecham, Francis Bacon (1605), and C. S. Peirce (1839–1914) provided the community to address these points of uncertainty. In particular, fallacious reasoning can be exposed, such as 'affirming the consequent'.

  Although some scientific research is applied research into specific problems, a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of basic research. This leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable. This point was made by Michael Faraday when, allegedly in response to the question "what is the use of basic research?" he responded "Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?".[88] For example, research into the effects of red light on the human eye's rod cells did not seem to have any practical purpose; eventually, the discovery that our night vision is not troubled by red light would lead search and rescue teams (among others) to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters.[77]:106–110 In a nutshell: Basic research is the search for knowledge. Applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge. Finally, even basic research can take unexpected turns, and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to harness luck.

  Research in practice
- |
  Due to the increasing complexity of information and specialization of scientists, most of the cutting-edge research today is done by well funded groups of scientists, rather than individuals.[89] D.K. Simonton notes that due to the breadth of very precise and far reaching tools already used by researchers today and the amount of research generated so far, creation of new disciplines or revolutions within a discipline may no longer be possible as it is unlikely that some phenomenon that merits its own discipline has been overlooked. Hybridizing of disciplines and finessing knowledge is, in his view, the future of science.[89]

Alhazen (or Al-Haytham; 965–1039 C.E.) was perhaps one of the greatest physicists of all times and a product of the Islamic Golden Age or Islamic Renaissance (7th–13th centuries). He made significant contributions to anatomy, astronomy, engineering, mathematics, medicine, ophthalmology, philosophy, physics, psychology, and visual perception and is primarily attributed as the inventor of the scientific method, for which author Bradley Steffens (2006) describes him as the "first scientist".

  The full title translation is from p.60 of James R. Voelkel (2001) Johannes Kepler and the New Astronomy Oxford University Press. Kepler was driven to this experiment after observing the partial solar eclipse at Graz, July 10, 1600. He used Tycho Brahe's method of observation, which was to project the image of the sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture, instead of looking directly at the sun. He disagreed with Brahe's conclusion that total eclipses of the sun were impossible, because there were historical accounts of total eclipses. Instead he deduced that the size of the aperture controls the sharpness of the projected image (the larger the aperture, the more accurate the image — this fact is now fundamental for optical system design). Voelkel, p.61, notes that Kepler's experiments produced the first correct account of vision and the eye, because he realized he could not accurately write about astronomical observation by ignoring the eye.

The first and fundamental form of experimentation in physics is to teach young people to work with their hands. Then they should be taken into a laboratory and taught to work with measuring instruments — each student carrying out real experiments in physics. This form of teaching is indispensable and cannot be read in a book."

  ^ a b In his investigation of the law of falling bodies, Galileo (1638) serves as example for scientific investigation: Two New Sciences "A piece of wooden moulding or scantling, about 12 cubits long, half a cubit wide, and three finger-breadths thick, was taken; on its edge was cut a channel a little more than one finger in breadth; having made this groove very straight, smooth, and polished, and having lined it with parchment, also as smooth and polished as possible, we rolled along it a hard, smooth, and very round bronze ball. Having placed this board in a sloping position, by lifting one end some one or two cubits above the other, we rolled the ball, as I was just saying, along the channel, noting, in a manner presently to be described, the time required to make the descent. We . . . now rolled the ball only one-quarter the length of the channel; and having measured the time of its descent, we found it precisely one-half of the former. Next we tried other distances, comparing the time for the whole length with that for the half, or with that for two-thirds, or three-fourths, or indeed for any fraction; in such experiments, repeated many, many, times." Galileo solved the problem of time measurement by weighing a jet of water collected during the descent of the bronze ball, as stated in his Two New Sciences.

The Stanford article states: "Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), "[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones." These and many other authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996): (1) it is not scientific, and (2) its major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific".

- '} );Science[nb 1] is a systematic enterprise that creates, builds and organizes
  knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.[nb
  2][2]:58Contemporary science is typically subdivided into the natural sciences which
  study the material world, the social sciences which study people and societies,
  and the formal sciences like mathematics. The formal sciences are often excluded
  as they do not depend on empirical observations.[3] Disciplines which use science
  like engineering and medicine may also be considered to be applied sciences.[4]From
  classical antiquity through the 19th century, science as a type of knowledge was
  more closely linked to philosophy than it is now and, in fact, in the West the term
  "natural philosophy" encompassed fields of study that are today associated with
  science such as physics, astronomy, medicine, among many others.[5]:3[nb 3]In the
  17th and 18th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in
  terms of laws of nature. Over the course of the 19th century, the word "science"
  became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself, as a disciplined
  way to study the natural world. It was in the 19th century that modern scientific
  disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and biology reached their modern shapes.
  The same time period also included the origin of the terms "scientist" and "scientific
  community," the founding of scientific institutions, and increasing significance
  of the interactions with society and other aspects of culture.[6][7]Science in a
  broad sense existed before the modern era, and in many historical civilizations.[nb
  4]Modern science is distinct in its approach and successful in its results: ''modern
  science'' now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term.[8]Science
  in its original sense is a word for a type of knowledge, rather than a specialized
  word for the pursuit of such knowledge. In particular it is one of the types of
  knowledge which people can communicate to each other and share. For example, knowledge
  about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and
  led to the development of complex abstract thinking. This is shown by the construction
  of complex calendars, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, and buildings
  such as the pyramids. However no consistent conscientious distinction was made between
  knowledge of such things which are true in every community and other types of communal
  knowledge, such as mythologies and legal systems.Before the invention or discovery
  of the concept of "nature" (Ancient Greek phusis), by the Pre-Socratic philosophers,
  the same words tend to be used to describe the natural "way" in which a plant grows,[9]
  and the "way" in which, for example, one tribe worships a particular god. For this
  reason it is claimed these men were the first philosophers in the strict sense,
  and also the first people to clearly distinguish "nature" and "convention".[10]
  Science was therefore distinguished as the knowledge of nature, and the things which
  are true for every community, and the name of the specialized pursuit of such knowledge
  was philosophy — the realm of the first philosopher-physicists. They were mainly
  speculators or theorists, particularly interested in astronomy. In contrast, trying
  to use knowledge of nature to imitate nature (artifice or technology, Greek technē)
  was seen by classical scientists as a more appropriate interest for lower class
  artisans.[11] A clear-cut distinction between formal (eon) and empirical science
  (doxa) was made by pre-Socratic philosopher Parmenides (fl. late sixth or early
  fifth century BCE). Although his work peri physeos is a poem, it may be viewed as
  an epistemological essay, an essay on method in natural science. Parmenides'' ἐὸν
  may refer to a formal system, a calculus which can describe nature more precisely
  than natural languages. ''Physis'' may be identical to ἐὸν.[12]A major turning point
  in the history of early philosophical science was the controversial but successful
  attempt by Socrates to apply philosophy to the study of human things, including
  human nature, the nature of political communities, and human knowledge itself. He
  criticized the older type of study of physics as too purely speculative, and lacking
  in self-criticism. He was particularly concerned that some of the early physicists
  treated nature as if it could be assumed that it had no intelligent order, explaining
  things merely in terms of motion and matter. The study of human things had been
  the realm of mythology and tradition, and Socrates was executed.[14]Aristotle later
  created a less controversial systematic programme of Socratic philosophy, which
  was teleological, and human-centred. He rejected many of the conclusions of earlier
  scientists. For example, in his physics the sun goes around the earth, and many
  things have it as part of their nature that they are for humans. Each thing has
  a formal cause and final cause and a role in the rational cosmic order. Motion and
  change is described as the actualization of potentials already in things, according
  to what types of things they are. While the Socratics insisted that philosophy should
  be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being
  (a study Aristotle divided into ethics and political philosophy), they did not argue
  for any other types of applied science.Aristotle maintained the sharp distinction
  between science and the practical knowledge of artisans, treating theoretical speculation
  as the highest type of human activity, practical thinking about good living as something
  less lofty, and the knowledge of artisans as something only suitable for the lower
  classes. In contrast to modern science, Aristotle''s influential emphasis was upon
  the "theoretical" steps of deducing universal rules from raw data, and did not treat
  the gathering of experience and raw data as part of science itself.[nb 5]During
  late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, the Aristotelian approach to inquiries
  on natural phenomena was used. Some ancient knowledge was lost, or in some cases
  kept in obscurity, during the fall of the Roman Empire and periodic political struggles.
  However, the general fields of science, or "natural philosophy" as it was called,
  and much of the general knowledge from the ancient world remained preserved though
  the works of the early Latin encyclopedists like Isidore of Seville. Also, in the
  Byzantine empire, many Greek science texts were preserved in Syriac translations
  done by groups such as Nestorians and Monophysites.[17] Many of these were translated
  later on into Arabic under the Caliphate, during which many types of classical learning
  were preserved and in some cases improved upon.[17][nb 7] The House of Wisdom was
  established in Abbasid-era Baghdad, Iraq.[18] It is considered to have been a major
  intellectual center, during the Islamic Golden Age, where Muslim scholars such as
  al-Kindi and Ibn Sahl in Baghdad, and Ibn al-Haytham in Cairo, flourished from the
  ninth to the thirteenth centuries, until the Mongol sack of Baghdad. Ibn al-Haytham,
  known later to the West as Alhazen, furthered the Aristotelian viewpoint,[19] by
  emphasizing experimental data.[nb 8][20] In the later medieval period, as demand
  for translations grew, for example from the Toledo School of Translators, Western
  Europeans began collecting texts written not only in Latin, but also Latin translations
  from Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew. The texts of Aristotle, Ptolemy,[nb 9] and Euclid,
  preserved in the Houses of Wisdom, were sought amongst Catholic scholars. In Europe,
  Alhazen''s De Aspectibus directly influenced Roger Bacon (13th century) in England,
  who argued for more experimental science, as demonstrated by Alhazen. By the late
  Middle Ages, a synthesis of Catholicism and Aristotelianism known as Scholasticism
  was flourishing in Western Europe, which had become a new geographic center of science,
  but all aspects of scholasticism were criticized in the 15th and 16th centuries.Medieval
  science carried on the views of the Hellenist civilization of Socrates, Plato, and
  Aristotle, as shown by Alhazen''s lost work A Book in which I have Summarized the
  Science of Optics from the Two Books of Euclid and Ptolemy, to which I have added
  the Notions of the First Discourse which is Missing from Ptolemy''s Book from Ibn
  Abi Usaibia''s catalog, as cited in (Smith 2001).:91(vol.1),p.xv Alhazen conclusively
  disproved Ptolemy''s theory of vision.But Alhacen retained Aristotle''s ontology;
  Roger Bacon, Witelo, and John Peckham each built-up a scholastic ontology upon Alhazen''s
  Book of Optics, a causal chain beginning with sensation, perception, and finally
  apperception of the individual and universal forms of Aristotle.[21] This model
  of vision became known as Perspectivism, which was exploited and studied by the
  artists of the Renaissance.A. Mark Smith points out the perspectivist theory of
  vision "is remarkably economical, reasonable, and coherent", which pivots on three
  of Aristotle''s four causes, formal, material, and final.[22] Although Alhacen knew
  that a scene imaged through an aperture is inverted, he argued that vision is about
  perception. This was overturned by Kepler,[23]:p.102 who modelled the eye with a
  water-filled glass sphere, with an aperture in front of it to model the entrance
  pupil. He found that all the light from a single point of the scene was imaged at
  a single point at the back of the glass sphere. The optical chain ends on the retina
  at the back of the eye and the image is inverted.[nb 10]Copernicus formulated a
  heliocentric model of the solar system unlike the geocentric model of Ptolemy''s
  Almagest.Galileo made innovative use of experiment and mathematics. However his
  persecution began after Pope Urban VIII blessed Galileo to write about the Copernican
  system. Galileo had used arguments from the Pope and put them in the voice of the
  simpleton in the work "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems" which caused
  great offense to him.[25]In Northern Europe, the new technology of the printing
  press was widely used to publish many arguments including some that disagreed with
  church dogma. René Descartes and Francis Bacon published philosophical arguments
  in favor of a new type of non-Aristotelian science. Descartes argued that mathematics
  could be used in order to study nature, as Galileo had done, and Bacon emphasized
  the importance of experiment over contemplation. Bacon questioned the Aristotelian
  concepts of formal cause and final cause, and promoted the idea that science should
  study the laws of "simple" natures, such as heat, rather than assuming that there
  is any specific nature, or "formal cause", of each complex type of thing. This new
  modern science began to see itself as describing "laws of nature". This updated
  approach to studies in nature was seen as mechanistic. Bacon also argued that science
  should aim for the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all
  human life.In the 17th and 18th centuries, the project of modernity, as had been
  promoted by Bacon and Descartes, led to rapid scientific advance and the successful
  development of a new type of natural science, mathematical, methodically experimental,
  and deliberately innovative. Newton and Leibniz succeeded in developing a new physics,
  now referred to as Newtonian physics, which could be confirmed by experiment and
  explained using mathematics. Leibniz also incorporated terms from Aristotelian physics,
  but now being used in a new non-teleological way, for example "energy" and "potential"
  (modern versions of Aristotelian "energeia and potentia"). In the style of Bacon,
  he assumed that different types of things all work according to the same general
  laws of nature, with no special formal or final causes for each type of thing. It
  is during this period that the word "science" gradually became more commonly used
  to refer to a type of pursuit of a type of knowledge, especially knowledge of nature —
  coming close in meaning to the old term "natural philosophy".Both John Herschel
  and William Whewell systematized methodology: the latter coined the term scientist.
  When Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species he established descent with
  modification as the prevailing evolutionary explanation of biological complexity.
  His theory of natural selection provided a natural explanation of how species originated,
  but this only gained wide acceptance a century later. John Dalton developed the
  idea of atoms. The laws of thermodynamics and the electromagnetic theory were also
  established in the 19th century, which raised new questions which could not easily
  be answered using Newton''s framework. The phenomena that would allow the deconstruction
  of the atom were discovered in the last decade of the 19th century: the discovery
  of X-rays inspired the discovery of radioactivity. In the next year came the discovery
  of the first subatomic particle, the electron.Einstein''s Theory of Relativity and
  the development of quantum mechanics led to the replacement of Newtonian physics
  with a new physics which contains two parts, that describe different types of events
  in nature.In the first half of the century the development of artificial fertilizer
  made possible global human population growth. At the same time, the structure of
  the atom and its nucleus was elucidated, leading to the release of "atomic energy"
  (nuclear power). In addition, the extensive use of scientific innovation, stimulated
  by the wars of this century, led to antibiotics and increased life expectancy, revolutions
  in transportation (automobiles and aircraft), and the development of ICBMs, a space
  race, and a nuclear arms race— all giving a widespread public appreciation of the
  importance of modern science.Widespread use of integrated circuits in the last quarter
  of the 20th century, combined with communications satellites, led to a revolution
  in information technology, and the rise of the global internet and mobile computing,
  including smartphones.More recently, it has been argued that the ultimate purpose
  of science is to make sense of human beings and our nature – for example in his
  book Consilience, EO Wilson said "The human condition is the most important frontier
  of the natural sciences." [2]:334The scientific method seeks to explain the events
  of nature in a reproducible way.[nb 11] An explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis
  is put forward, as explanation, using principles such as parsimony (also known as
  "Occam''s Razor") and are generally expected to seek consilience—fitting well with
  other accepted facts related to the phenomena.[2][dubious – discuss] This new explanation
  is used to make falsifiable predictions that are testable by experiment or observation.
  The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is
  sought, as proof that no tampering has occurred. Disproof of a prediction is evidence
  of progress.[nb 12][nb 13] This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena,
  but also through experimentation, that tries to simulate natural events under controlled
  conditions, as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences, such
  as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled
  experiment). Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish
  causal relationships (to avoid the correlation fallacy).When a hypothesis proves
  unsatisfactory, it is either modified or discarded.[26] If the hypothesis survived
  testing, it may become adopted into the framework of a scientific theory. This is
  a logically reasoned, self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior
  of certain natural phenomena. A theory typically describes the behavior of much
  broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis; commonly, a large number of hypotheses
  can be logically bound together by a single theory. Thus a theory is a hypothesis
  explaining various other hypotheses. In that vein, theories are formulated according
  to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses. In addition to testing
  hypotheses, scientists may also generate a model based on observed phenomena. This
  is an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical, physical
  or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested.[27]While
  performing experiments to test hypotheses, scientists may have a preference for
  one outcome over another, and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole
  can eliminate this bias.[28][29] This can be achieved by careful experimental design,
  transparency, and a thorough peer review process of the experimental results as
  well as any conclusions.[30][31] After the results of an experiment are announced
  or published, it is normal practice for independent researchers to double-check
  how the research was performed, and to follow up by performing similar experiments
  to determine how dependable the results might be.[32] Taken in its entirety, the
  scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any
  effects of subjective bias on the part of its users (namely the confirmation bias).[33]Mathematics
  is essential to the sciences. One important function of mathematics in science is
  the role it plays in the expression of scientific models. Observing and collecting
  measurements, as well as hypothesizing and predicting, often require extensive use
  of mathematics. Arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry and calculus, for example,
  are all essential to physics. Virtually every branch of mathematics has applications
  in science, including "pure" areas such as number theory and topology.Statistical
  methods, which are mathematical techniques for summarizing and analyzing data, allow
  scientists to assess the level of reliability and the range of variation in experimental
  results. Statistical analysis plays a fundamental role in many areas of both the
  natural sciences and social sciences.Computational science applies computing power
  to simulate real-world situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific
  problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve. According to the Society for
  Industrial and Applied Mathematics, computation is now as important as theory and
  experiment in advancing scientific knowledge.[34]Whether mathematics itself is properly
  classified as science has been a matter of some debate. Some thinkers see mathematicians
  as scientists, regarding physical experiments as inessential or mathematical proofs
  as equivalent to experiments. Others do not see mathematics as a science, since
  it does not require an experimental test of its theories and hypotheses. Mathematical
  theorems and formulas are obtained by logical derivations which presume axiomatic
  systems, rather than the combination of empirical observation and logical reasoning
  that has come to be known as the scientific method. In general, mathematics is classified
  as formal science, while natural and social sciences are classified as empirical
  sciences.[35]The scientific community is the group of all interacting scientists.
  It includes many sub-communities working on particular scientific fields, and within
  particular institutions; interdisciplinary and cross-institutional activities are
  also significant.Scientific fields are commonly divided into two major groups: natural
  sciences, which study natural phenomena (including biological life), and social
  sciences, which study human behavior and societies. These groupings are empirical
  sciences, which means the knowledge must be based on observable phenomena and capable
  of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions.[36]
  There are also related disciplines that are grouped into interdisciplinary applied
  sciences, such as engineering and medicine. Within these categories are specialized
  scientific fields that can include parts of other scientific disciplines but often
  possess their own nomenclature and expertise.[37]Mathematics, which is classified
  as a formal science,[38][39] has both similarities and differences with the empirical
  sciences (the natural and social sciences). It is similar to empirical sciences
  in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge;
  it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using a priori
  rather than empirical methods.[40] The formal sciences, which also include statistics
  and logic, are vital to the empirical sciences. Major advances in formal science
  have often led to major advances in the empirical sciences. The formal sciences
  are essential in the formation of hypotheses, theories, and laws,[41] both in discovering
  and describing how things work (natural sciences) and how people think and act (social
  sciences).Apart from its broad meaning, the word "Science" sometimes may specifically
  refer to fundamental sciences (maths and natural sciences) alone. Science schools
  or faculties within many institutions are separate from those for medicine or engineering,
  which is an applied science.Learned societies for the communication and promotion
  of scientific thought and experimentation have existed since the Renaissance period.[42]
  The oldest surviving institution is the Italian Accademia dei Lincei which was established
  in 1603.[43] The respective National Academies of Science are distinguished institutions
  that exist in a number of countries, beginning with the British Royal Society in
  1660[44] and the French Académie des Sciences in 1666.[45]International scientific
  organizations, such as the International Council for Science, have since been formed
  to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations.
  Many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research. Prominent
  scientific organizations include, the National Science Foundation in the U.S., the
  National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina, the academies of
  science of many nations, CSIRO in Australia, Centre national de la recherche scientifique
  in France, Max Planck Society and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft in Germany, and
  in Spain, CSIC.An enormous range of scientific literature is published.[46]Scientific
  journals communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities
  and various other research institutions, serving as an archival record of science.
  The first scientific journals, Journal des Sçavans followed by the Philosophical
  Transactions, began publication in 1665. Since that time the total number of active
  periodicals has steadily increased. In 1981, one estimate for the number of scientific
  and technical journals in publication was 11,500.[47] The United States National
  Library of Medicine currently indexes 5,516 journals that contain articles on topics
  related to the life sciences. Although the journals are in 39 languages, 91 percent
  of the indexed articles are published in English.[48]Most scientific journals cover
  a single scientific field and publish the research within that field; the research
  is normally expressed in the form of a scientific paper. Science has become so pervasive
  in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the
  achievements, news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace.Science magazines
  such as New Scientist, Science & Vie, and Scientific American cater to the needs
  of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas
  of research, including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research.
  Science books engage the interest of many more people. Tangentially, the science
  fiction genre, primarily fantastic in nature, engages the public imagination and
  transmits the ideas, if not the methods, of science.Recent efforts to intensify
  or develop links between science and non-scientific disciplines such as Literature
  or, more specifically, Poetry, include the Creative Writing Science resource developed
  through the Royal Literary Fund.[49]Science has traditionally been a male-dominated
  field, with some notable exceptions.[nb 14] Women historically faced considerable
  discrimination in science, much as they did in other areas of male-dominated societies,
  such as frequently being passed over for job opportunities and denied credit for
  their work.[nb 15] For example, Christine Ladd (1847–1930) was able to enter a Ph.D.
  program as ''C. Ladd''; Christine "Kitty" Ladd completed the requirements in 1882,
  but was awarded her degree only in 1926, after a career which spanned the algebra
  of logic (see truth table), color vision, and psychology. Her work preceded notable
  researchers like Ludwig Wittgenstein and Charles Sanders Peirce. The achievements
  of women in science have been attributed to their defiance of their traditional
  role as laborers within the domestic sphere.[50]In the late 20th century, active
  recruitment of women and elimination of institutional discrimination on the basis
  of sex greatly increased the number of female scientists, but large gender disparities
  remain in some fields; over half of new biologists are female, while 80% of PhDs
  in physics are given to men. Feminists claim this is the result of culture rather
  than an innate difference between the sexes, and some experiments have shown that
  parents challenge and explain more to boys than girls, asking them to reflect more
  deeply and logically.[51] In the early part of the 21st century, in America, women
  earned 50.3% bachelor''s degrees, 45.6% master''s degrees, and 40.7% of PhDs in
  science and engineering fields with women earning more than half of the degrees
  in three fields: Psychology (about 70%), Social Sciences (about 50%), and Biology
  (about 50-60%). However, when it comes to the Physical Sciences, Geosciences, Math,
  Engineering, and Computer Science; women earned less than half the degrees.[52]
  However, lifestyle choice also plays a major role in female engagement in science;
  women with young children are 28% less likely to take tenure-track positions due
  to work-life balance issues,[53] and female graduate students'' interest in careers
  in research declines dramatically over the course of graduate school, whereas that
  of their male colleagues remains unchanged.[54]Science policy is an area of public
  policy concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise,
  including research funding, often in pursuance of other national policy goals such
  as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development,
  health care and environmental monitoring. Science policy also refers to the act
  of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies.
  Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural
  sciences. In accordance with public policy being concerned about the well-being
  of its citizens, science policy''s goal is to consider how science and technology
  can best serve the public.State policy has influenced the funding of public works
  and science for thousands of years, dating at least from the time of the Mohists,
  who inspired the study of logic during the period of the Hundred Schools of Thought,
  and the study of defensive fortifications during the Warring States period in China.
  In Great Britain, governmental approval of the Royal Society in the 17th century
  recognized a scientific community which exists to this day. The professionalization
  of science, begun in the 19th century, was partly enabled by the creation of scientific
  organizations such as the National Academy of Sciences, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute,
  and State funding of universities of their respective nations. Public policy can
  directly affect the funding of capital equipment, intellectual infrastructure for
  industrial research, by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund
  research. Vannevar Bush, director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development
  for the United States government, the forerunner of the National Science Foundation,
  wrote in July 1945 that "Science is a proper concern of government".[55]Science
  and technology research is often funded through a competitive process, in which
  potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding.
  Such processes, which are run by government, corporations or foundations, allocate
  scarce funds. Total research funding in most developed countries is between 1.5%
  and 3% of GDP.[56] In the OECD, around two-thirds of research and development in
  scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 20% and 10% respectively
  by universities and government. The government funding proportion in certain industries
  is higher, and it dominates research in social science and humanities. Similarly,
  with some exceptions (e.g. biotechnology) government provides the bulk of the funds
  for basic scientific research. In commercial research and development, all but the
  most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation
  possibilities rather than "blue-sky" ideas or technologies (such as nuclear fusion).The
  mass media face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting
  competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific
  community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific
  debate may require considerable expertise regarding the matter.[57] Few journalists
  have real scientific knowledge, and even beat reporters who know a great deal about
  certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific issues that they
  are suddenly asked to cover.[58][59]Many issues damage the relationship of science
  to the media and the use of science and scientific arguments by politicians. As
  a very broad generalisation, many politicians seek certainties and facts whilst
  scientists typically offer probabilities and caveats. However, politicians'' ability
  to be heard in the mass media frequently distorts the scientific understanding by
  the public. Examples in Britain include the controversy over the MMR inoculation,
  and the 1988 forced resignation of a Government Minister, Edwina Currie for revealing
  the high probability that battery farmed eggs were contaminated with Salmonella.[60]John
  Horgan, Chris Mooney, and researchers from the US and Canada have described Scientific
  Certainty Argumentation Methods (SCAMs), where an organization or think tank makes
  it their only goal to cast doubt on supported science because it conflicts with
  political agendas.[61][62][63][64] Hank Campbell and microbiologist Alex Berezow
  have described "feel-good fallacies" used in politics, where politicians frame their
  positions in a way that makes people feel good about supporting certain policies
  even when scientific evidence shows there is no need to worry or there is no need
  for dramatic change on current programs.[65]Various activities are developed to
  approximate the general public and science/scientists, such as in science outreach,
  public awareness of science, science communication, science festivals, citizen science,
  science journalism, public science, popular science, etc.; see Science and the public
  for related concepts. Science is represented by the ''S'' in STEM fields.Working
  scientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to
  justify the scientific method: (1) that there is an objective reality shared by
  all rational observers; (2) that this objective reality is governed by natural laws;
  (3) that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation.[8]
  Philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions
  mean and whether they are valid.The belief that scientific theories should and do
  represent metaphysical reality is known as realism. It can be contrasted with anti-realism,
  the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about
  unobservable entities such as electrons. One form of anti-realism is idealism, the
  belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence, and that each mind
  generates its own reality.[nb 16] In an idealistic world view, what is true for
  one mind need not be true for other minds.There are different schools of thought
  in philosophy of science. The most popular position is empiricism,[nb 17] which
  holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific
  theories are the result of generalizations from such observations.[66] Empiricism
  generally encompasses inductivism, a position that tries to explain the way general
  theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and
  hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories.
  This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite,
  which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using deductive
  logic only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being bayesianism[67]
  and the hypothetico-deductive method.[68]:p236Empiricism has stood in contrast to
  rationalism, the position originally associated with Descartes, which holds that
  knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation.[68]:p20Critical
  rationalism is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by
  Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper. Popper rejected the way that empiricism
  describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories
  are not generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of theories
  and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in
  conflict with it.[68]:pp63–7 Popper proposed replacing verifiability with falsifiability
  as the landmark of scientific theories, and replacing induction with falsification
  as the empirical method.[68]:p68 Popper further claimed that there is actually only
  one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism,
  trial and error.[69] It covers all products of the human mind, including science,
  mathematics, philosophy, and art.[70]Another approach, instrumentalism, colloquially
  termed "shut up and calculate", emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments
  for explaining and predicting phenomena.[71] It views scientific theories as black
  boxes with only their input (initial conditions) and output (predictions) being
  relevant. Consequences, theoretical entities and logical structure are claimed to
  be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn''t make a
  fuss about (see interpretations of quantum mechanics). Close to instrumentalism
  is constructive empiricism, according to which the main criterion for the success
  of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true.Paul
  K Feyerabend advanced the idea of epistemological anarchism, which holds that there
  are no useful and exception-free methodological rules governing the progress of
  science or the growth of knowledge, and that the idea that science can or should
  operate according to universal and fixed rules is unrealistic, pernicious and detrimental
  to science itself.[72] Feyerabend advocates treating science as an ideology alongside
  others such as religion, magic and mythology, and considers the dominance of science
  in society authoritarian and unjustified. He also contended (along with Imre Lakatos)[discuss]
  that the demarcation problem of distinguishing science from pseudoscience on objective
  grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according
  to fixed, universal rules.[72] Feyerabend also stated that science does not have
  evidence for its philosophical precepts, particularly the notion of Uniformity of
  Law and the Uniformity of Process across time and space.[73]Finally, another approach
  often cited in debates of scientific skepticism against controversial movements
  like "scientific creationism", is methodological naturalism. Its main point is that
  a difference between natural and supernatural explanations should be made, and that
  science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations.[nb 18] That
  the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means that science
  should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not claim them
  to be wrong either. Instead, supernatural explanations should be left a matter of
  personal belief outside the scope of science. Methodological naturalism maintains
  that proper science requires strict adherence to empirical study and independent
  verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for
  observable phenomena.[74] The absence of these standards, arguments from authority,
  biased observational studies and other common fallacies are frequently cited by
  supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non-science they
  criticize.A scientific theory is empirical,[nb 17][75] and is always open to falsification
  if new evidence is presented. That is, no theory is ever considered strictly certain
  as science accepts the concept of fallibilism.[nb 19] The philosopher of science
  Karl Popper sharply distinguishes truth from certainty. He writes that scientific
  knowledge "consists in the search for truth", but it "is not the search for certainty ...
  All human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain."[76]:p4New scientific knowledge
  rarely results in vast changes in our understanding. According to psychologist Keith
  Stanovich, it may be the media''s overuse of words like "breakthrough" that leads
  the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was
  true to be false.[77]:119–138 While there are such famous cases as the theory of
  relativity that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions.
  Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different
  experiments, by various researchers, across different branches of science; it is
  more like a climb than a leap.[77]:123 Theories vary in the extent to which they
  have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community.[nb
  20] For example, heliocentric theory, the theory of evolution, relativity theory,
  and germ theory still bear the name "theory" even though, in practice, they are
  considered factual.[78] Philosopher Barry Stroud adds that, although the best definition
  for "knowledge" is contested, being skeptical and entertaining the possibility that
  one is incorrect is compatible with being correct. Ironically then, the scientist
  adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess
  the truth.[79] The fallibilist C. S. Peirce argued that inquiry is the struggle
  to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome, verbal, or hyperbolic doubt
  is fruitless[80]—but also that the inquirer should try to attain genuine doubt rather
  than resting uncritically on common sense.[81] He held that the successful sciences
  trust, not to any single chain of inference (no stronger than its weakest link),
  but to the cable of multiple and various arguments intimately connected.[82]Stanovich
  also asserts that science avoids searching for a "magic bullet"; it avoids the single-cause
  fallacy. This means a scientist would not ask merely "What is the cause of ...",
  but rather "What are the most significant causes of ...". This is especially the
  case in the more macroscopic fields of science (e.g. psychology, cosmology).[77]:141–147
  Of course, research often analyzes few factors at once, but these are always added
  to the long list of factors that are most important to consider.[77]:141–147 For
  example: knowing the details of only a person''s genetics, or their history and
  upbringing, or the current situation may not explain a behaviour, but a deep understanding
  of all these variables combined can be very predictive.An area of study or speculation
  that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not
  otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes referred to as pseudoscience, fringe science,
  or junk science.[nb 21] Physicist Richard Feynman coined the term "cargo cult science"
  for cases in which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities
  have the outward appearance of science but actually lack the "kind of utter honesty"
  that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated.[83] Various types of commercial
  advertising, ranging from hype to fraud, may fall into these categories.There also
  can be[discuss] an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of scientific
  debates.[citation needed] Sometimes, research may be characterized as "bad science",
  research that may be well-intentioned but is actually incorrect, obsolete, incomplete,
  or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas. The term "scientific misconduct"
  refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented
  their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong
  person.[84]Although encyclopedias such as Pliny (fl. 77 AD) Natural History offered
  purported fact, they proved unreliable. A skeptical point of view, demanding a method
  of proof, was the practical position taken to deal with unreliable knowledge. As
  early as 1000 years ago, scholars such as Alhazen (Doubts Concerning Ptolemy), Roger
  Bacon, Witelo, John Pecham, Francis Bacon (1605), and C. S. Peirce (1839–1914) provided
  the community to address these points of uncertainty. In particular, fallacious
  reasoning can be exposed, such as ''affirming the consequent''."If a man will begin
  with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with
  doubts, he shall end in certainties." —Francis Bacon (1605) The Advancement of Learning,
  Book 1, v, 8The methods of inquiry into a problem have been known for thousands
  of years,[85] and extend beyond theory to practice. The use of measurements, for
  example, is a practical approach to settle disputes in the community.John Ziman
  points out that intersubjective pattern recognition is fundamental to the creation
  of all scientific knowledge.[86]:p44 Ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns
  to each other across centuries: Ziman refers to this ability as ''perceptual consensibility''.[87]:p46
  Ziman then makes consensibility, leading to consensus, the touchstone of reliable
  knowledge.[87]:p104Although some scientific research is applied research into specific
  problems, a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking
  of basic research. This leads to options for technological advance that were not
  planned or sometimes even imaginable. This point was made by Michael Faraday when,
  allegedly in response to the question "what is the use of basic research?" he responded
  "Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?".[88] For example, research into the
  effects of red light on the human eye''s rod cells did not seem to have any practical
  purpose; eventually, the discovery that our night vision is not troubled by red
  light would lead search and rescue teams (among others) to adopt red light in the
  cockpits of jets and helicopters.[77]:106–110 In a nutshell: Basic research is the
  search for knowledge. Applied research is the search for solutions to practical
  problems using this knowledge. Finally, even basic research can take unexpected
  turns, and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to harness
  luck.Due to the increasing complexity of information and specialization of scientists,
  most of the cutting-edge research today is done by well funded groups of scientists,
  rather than individuals.[89] D.K. Simonton notes that due to the breadth of very
  precise and far reaching tools already used by researchers today and the amount
  of research generated so far, creation of new disciplines or revolutions within
  a discipline may no longer be possible as it is unlikely that some phenomenon that
  merits its own discipline has been overlooked. Hybridizing of disciplines and finessing
  knowledge is, in his view, the future of science.[89]Discoveries in fundamental
  science can be world-changing. For example:PublicationsResources'

  1] is a systematic enterprise that creates, builds and organizes knowledge in the
  form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.[nb 2][2]:58\nContemporary
  science is typically subdivided into the natural sciences which study the material
  world, the social sciences which study people and societies, and the formal sciences
  like mathematics. The formal sciences are often excluded as they do not depend on
  empirical observations.[3] Disciplines which use science like engineering and medicine
  may also be considered to be applied sciences.[4]\nFrom classical antiquity through
  the 19th century, science as a type of knowledge was more closely linked to philosophy
  than it is now and, in fact, in the West the term \"natural philosophy\" encompassed
  fields of study that are today associated with science such as physics, astronomy,
  medicine, among many others.[5]:3[nb 3]\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries scientists
  increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of laws of nature. Over the
  course of the 19th century, the word \"science\" became increasingly associated
  with the scientific method itself, as a disciplined way to study the natural world.
  It was in the 19th century that modern scientific disciplines such as physics, chemistry,
  and biology reached their modern shapes. The same time period also included the
  origin of the terms \"scientist\" and \"scientific community,\" the founding of
  scientific institutions, and increasing significance of the interactions with society
  and other aspects of culture.[6][7]\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n1.1 Antiquity\n1.2

  from the separation of Pangaea until the present day\n\n\nScience in a broad sense
  existed before the modern era, and in many historical civilizations.[nb 4]Modern
  science is distinct in its approach and successful in its results: 'modern science'
  now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term.[8]\nScience in its
  original sense is a word for a type of knowledge, rather than a specialized word
  for the pursuit of such knowledge. In particular it is one of the types of knowledge
  which people can communicate to each other and share. For example, knowledge about
  the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and led
  to the development of complex abstract thinking. This is shown by the construction
  of complex calendars, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, and buildings
  such as the pyramids. However no consistent conscientious distinction was made between
  knowledge of such things which are true in every community and other types of communal
  knowledge, such as mythologies and legal systems.\nAntiquity\nSee also: Nature (philosophy)\n\n\n\n\nMaize,
  known in some English-speaking countries as corn, is a large grain plant domesticated
  by indigenous peoples in Mesoamerica in prehistoric times\n\n\nBefore the invention
  or discovery of the concept of \"nature\" (Ancient Greek phusis), by the Pre-Socratic
  philosophers, the same words tend to be used to describe the natural \"way\" in
  which a plant grows,[9] and the \"way\" in which, for example, one tribe worships
  a particular god. For this reason it is claimed these men were the first philosophers
  in the strict sense, and also the first people to clearly distinguish \"nature\"
  and \"convention\".[10] Science was therefore distinguished as the knowledge of
  nature, and the things which are true for every community, and the name of the specialized
  pursuit of such knowledge was philosophy — the realm of the first philosopher-physicists.
  They were mainly speculators or theorists, particularly interested in astronomy.
  In contrast, trying to use knowledge of nature to imitate nature (artifice or technology,
  Greek technē) was seen by classical scientists as a more appropriate interest for
  lower class artisans.[11] A clear-cut distinction between formal (eon) and empirical
  science (doxa) was made by pre-Socratic philosopher Parmenides (fl. late sixth or
  early fifth century BCE). Although his work peri physeos is a poem, it may be viewed
  as an epistemological essay, an essay on method in natural science. Parmenides'
  ἐὸν may refer to a formal system, a calculus which can describe nature more precisely
  than natural languages. 'Physis' may be identical to ἐὸν.[12]\n\n\n\n\nAristotle,
  384 BC – 322 BC - one of the early figures in the development of the scientific
  method[13]\n\n\nA major turning point in the history of early philosophical science
  was the controversial but successful attempt by Socrates to apply philosophy to
  the study of human things, including human nature, the nature of political communities,
  and human knowledge itself. He criticized the older type of study of physics as
  too purely speculative, and lacking in self-criticism. He was particularly concerned
  that some of the early physicists treated nature as if it could be assumed that
  it had no intelligent order, explaining things merely in terms of motion and matter.
  The study of human things had been the realm of mythology and tradition, and Socrates
  was executed.[14]Aristotle later created a less controversial systematic programme
  of Socratic philosophy, which was teleological, and human-centred. He rejected many
  of the conclusions of earlier scientists. For example, in his physics the sun goes
  around the earth, and many things have it as part of their nature that they are
  for humans. Each thing has a formal cause and final cause and a role in the rational
  cosmic order. Motion and change is described as the actualization of potentials
  already in things, according to what types of things they are. While the Socratics
  insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the
  best way to live for a human being (a study Aristotle divided into ethics and political
  philosophy), they did not argue for any other types of applied science.\nAristotle
  maintained the sharp distinction between science and the practical knowledge of
  artisans, treating theoretical speculation as the highest type of human activity,
  practical thinking about good living as something less lofty, and the knowledge
  of artisans as something only suitable for the lower classes. In contrast to modern
  science, Aristotle's influential emphasis was upon the \"theoretical\" steps of
  deducing universal rules from raw data, and did not treat the gathering of experience
  and raw data as part of science itself.[nb 5]\nMedieval science\n\n\n\n\nDe potentiis
  anime sensitive, Gregor Reisch (1504) Margarita philosophica. Medieval science mooted
  a ventricle of the brain as the location for our common sense,[15] where the forms
  from our sensory systems commingled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIbn al-Haytham (Alhazen), 965–1039
  Iraq. The Muslim scholar who is considered by some to be the father of modern scientific
  methodology due to his emphasis on experimental data and reproducibility of its
  results.[16][nb 6]\n\n\nDuring late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, the Aristotelian
  approach to inquiries on natural phenomena was used. Some ancient knowledge was
  lost, or in some cases kept in obscurity, during the fall of the Roman Empire and
  periodic political struggles. However, the general fields of science, or \"natural
  philosophy\" as it was called, and much of the general knowledge from the ancient
  world remained preserved though the works of the early Latin encyclopedists like
  Isidore of Seville. Also, in the Byzantine empire, many Greek science texts were
  preserved in Syriac translations done by groups such as Nestorians and Monophysites.[17]
  Many of these were translated later on into Arabic under the Caliphate, during which
  many types of classical learning were preserved and in some cases improved upon.[17][nb
  7] The House of Wisdom was established in Abbasid-era Baghdad, Iraq.[18] It is considered
  to have been a major intellectual center, during the Islamic Golden Age, where Muslim
  scholars such as al-Kindi and Ibn Sahl in Baghdad, and Ibn al-Haytham in Cairo,
  flourished from the ninth to the thirteenth centuries, until the Mongol sack of
  Baghdad. Ibn al-Haytham, known later to the West as Alhazen, furthered the Aristotelian
  viewpoint,[19] by emphasizing experimental data.[nb 8][20] In the later medieval
  period, as demand for translations grew, for example from the Toledo School of Translators,
  Western Europeans began collecting texts written not only in Latin, but also Latin
  translations from Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew. The texts of Aristotle, Ptolemy,[nb
  9] and Euclid, preserved in the Houses of Wisdom, were sought amongst Catholic scholars.
  In Europe, Alhazen's De Aspectibus directly influenced Roger Bacon (13th century)
  in England, who argued for more experimental science, as demonstrated by Alhazen.
  By the late Middle Ages, a synthesis of Catholicism and Aristotelianism known as
  Scholasticism was flourishing in Western Europe, which had become a new geographic
  center of science, but all aspects of scholasticism were criticized in the 15th
  and 16th centuries.\nRenaissance, and early modern science\nMain article: Scientific
  revolution\n\n\n\n\nGalen (129—c. 216) noted the optic chiasm is X-shaped. (Engraving
  from Vesalius, 1543)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront page of the 1572 Latin Opticae Thesaurus
  (optics treasury), which included Alhazen's Book of Optics, showing propagation

  water, and perspective.\n\n\nMedieval science carried on the views of the Hellenist
  civilization of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, as shown by Alhazen's lost work
  A Book in which I have Summarized the Science of Optics from the Two Books of Euclid
  and Ptolemy, to which I have added the Notions of the First Discourse which is Missing
  from Ptolemy's Book from Ibn Abi Usaibia's catalog, as cited in (Smith 2001).:91(vol.1),p.xv
  Alhazen conclusively disproved Ptolemy's theory of vision.\n\n\n\n\n\nDürer's use
  of optics (1525)\n\n\n\nBut Alhacen retained Aristotle's ontology; Roger Bacon,
  Witelo, and John Peckham each built-up a scholastic ontology upon Alhazen's Book
  of Optics, a causal chain beginning with sensation, perception, and finally apperception
  of the individual and universal forms of Aristotle.[21] This model of vision became
  known as Perspectivism, which was exploited and studied by the artists of the Renaissance.\nA.
  Mark Smith points out the perspectivist theory of vision \"is remarkably economical,
  reasonable, and coherent\", which pivots on three of Aristotle's four causes, formal,
  material, and final.[22] Although Alhacen knew that a scene imaged through an aperture
  is inverted, he argued that vision is about perception. This was overturned by Kepler,[23]:p.102
  who modelled the eye with a water-filled glass sphere, with an aperture in front
  of it to model the entrance pupil. He found that all the light from a single point
  of the scene was imaged at a single point at the back of the glass sphere. The optical
  chain ends on the retina at the back of the eye and the image is inverted.[nb 10]\nCopernicus
  formulated a heliocentric model of the solar system unlike the geocentric model
  of Ptolemy's Almagest.\n\n\n\n\nGalileo Galilei, father of modern science.[24]\n\n\nGalileo
  made innovative use of experiment and mathematics. However his persecution began
  after Pope Urban VIII blessed Galileo to write about the Copernican system. Galileo
  had used arguments from the Pope and put them in the voice of the simpleton in the
  work \"Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems\" which caused great offense
  to him.[25]\nIn Northern Europe, the new technology of the printing press was widely
  used to publish many arguments including some that disagreed with church dogma.
  René Descartes and Francis Bacon published philosophical arguments in favor of a
  new type of non-Aristotelian science. Descartes argued that mathematics could be
  used in order to study nature, as Galileo had done, and Bacon emphasized the importance
  of experiment over contemplation. Bacon questioned the Aristotelian concepts of
  formal cause and final cause, and promoted the idea that science should study the
  laws of \"simple\" natures, such as heat, rather than assuming that there is any
  specific nature, or \"formal cause\", of each complex type of thing. This new modern
  science began to see itself as describing \"laws of nature\". This updated approach
  to studies in nature was seen as mechanistic. Bacon also argued that science should
  aim for the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all human
  life.\nAge of Enlightenment\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, the project of modernity,
  as had been promoted by Bacon and Descartes, led to rapid scientific advance and
  the successful development of a new type of natural science, mathematical, methodically
  experimental, and deliberately innovative. Newton and Leibniz succeeded in developing
  a new physics, now referred to as Newtonian physics, which could be confirmed by
  experiment and explained using mathematics. Leibniz also incorporated terms from
  Aristotelian physics, but now being used in a new non-teleological way, for example
  \"energy\" and \"potential\" (modern versions of Aristotelian \"energeia and potentia\").
  In the style of Bacon, he assumed that different types of things all work according
  to the same general laws of nature, with no special formal or final causes for each
  type of thing. It is during this period that the word \"science\" gradually became
  more commonly used to refer to a type of pursuit of a type of knowledge, especially
  knowledge of nature — coming close in meaning to the old term \"natural philosophy\".\n19th
  century\n\n\n\n\nCharles Darwin in 1854, by then working towards publication of
  On the Origin of Species\n\n\nBoth John Herschel and William Whewell systematized
  methodology: the latter coined the term scientist. When Charles Darwin published
  On the Origin of Species he established descent with modification as the prevailing
  evolutionary explanation of biological complexity. His theory of natural selection
  provided a natural explanation of how species originated, but this only gained wide
  acceptance a century later. John Dalton developed the idea of atoms. The laws of
  thermodynamics and the electromagnetic theory were also established in the 19th
  century, which raised new questions which could not easily be answered using Newton's
  framework. The phenomena that would allow the deconstruction of the atom were discovered
  in the last decade of the 19th century: the discovery of X-rays inspired the discovery
  of radioactivity. In the next year came the discovery of the first subatomic particle,
  the electron.\n\n\n\n\nCombustion and chemical reactions were studied by Michael
  Faraday and reported in his lectures before the Royal Institution: The Chemical
  History of a Candle, 1861\n\n\n20th century and beyond\n\n\n\n\nA simulated event
  in the CMS detector of the Large Hadron Collider, featuring a possible appearance
  of the Higgs boson\n\n\nEinstein's Theory of Relativity and the development of quantum
  mechanics led to the replacement of Newtonian physics with a new physics which contains
  two parts, that describe different types of events in nature.\nIn the first half
  of the century the development of artificial fertilizer made possible global human
  population growth. At the same time, the structure of the atom and its nucleus was
  elucidated, leading to the release of \"atomic energy\" (nuclear power). In addition,
  the extensive use of scientific innovation, stimulated by the wars of this century,
  led to antibiotics and increased life expectancy, revolutions in transportation
  (automobiles and aircraft), and the development of ICBMs, a space race, and a nuclear
  arms race— all giving a widespread public appreciation of the importance of modern
  science.\nWidespread use of integrated circuits in the last quarter of the 20th
  century, combined with communications satellites, led to a revolution in information
  technology, and the rise of the global internet and mobile computing, including
  smartphones.\nMore recently, it has been argued that the ultimate purpose of science
  is to make sense of human beings and our nature – for example in his book Consilience,
  EO Wilson said \"The human condition is the most important frontier of the natural
  sciences.\" [2]:334\nThe scientific method\nMain article: Scientific method\nThe
  scientific method seeks to explain the events of nature in a reproducible way.[nb
  11] An explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis is put forward, as explanation,
  using principles such as parsimony (also known as \"Occam's Razor\") and are generally
  expected to seek consilience—fitting well with other accepted facts related to the
  phenomena.[2][dubious – discuss] This new explanation is used to make falsifiable
  predictions that are testable by experiment or observation. The predictions are
  to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought, as proof that
  no tampering has occurred. Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress.[nb
  12][nb 13] This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena, but also
  through experimentation, that tries to simulate natural events under controlled
  conditions, as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences, such
  as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled
  experiment). Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish
  causal relationships (to avoid the correlation fallacy).\n\n\n\n\nIsaac Newton,
  shown here in a 1689 portrait, made seminal contributions to classical mechanics,
  gravity, and optics. Newton shares credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the development
  of calculus.\n\n\nWhen a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory, it is either modified
  or discarded.[26] If the hypothesis survived testing, it may become adopted into
  the framework of a scientific theory. This is a logically reasoned, self-consistent
  model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena. A theory
  typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis;
  commonly, a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single
  theory. Thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses. In that
  vein, theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles
  as hypotheses. In addition to testing hypotheses, scientists may also generate a
  model based on observed phenomena. This is an attempt to describe or depict the
  phenomenon in terms of a logical, physical or mathematical representation and to
  generate new hypotheses that can be tested.[27]\nWhile performing experiments to
  test hypotheses, scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another,
  and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias.[28][29]
  This can be achieved by careful experimental design, transparency, and a thorough
  peer review process of the experimental results as well as any conclusions.[30][31]
  After the results of an experiment are announced or published, it is normal practice
  for independent researchers to double-check how the research was performed, and
  to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results
  might be.[32] Taken in its entirety, the scientific method allows for highly creative
  problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective bias on the part of its
  users (namely the confirmation bias).[33]\nMathematics and formal sciences\nMain
  article: Mathematics\nMathematics is essential to the sciences. One important function
  of mathematics in science is the role it plays in the expression of scientific models.
  Observing and collecting measurements, as well as hypothesizing and predicting,
  often require extensive use of mathematics. Arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry
  and calculus, for example, are all essential to physics. Virtually every branch
  of mathematics has applications in science, including \"pure\" areas such as number
  theory and topology.\nStatistical methods, which are mathematical techniques for
  summarizing and analyzing data, allow scientists to assess the level of reliability
  and the range of variation in experimental results. Statistical analysis plays a
  fundamental role in many areas of both the natural sciences and social sciences.\nComputational
  science applies computing power to simulate real-world situations, enabling a better
  understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve.
  According to the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, computation is
  now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge.[34]\nWhether
  mathematics itself is properly classified as science has been a matter of some debate.
  Some thinkers see mathematicians as scientists, regarding physical experiments as
  inessential or mathematical proofs as equivalent to experiments. Others do not see
  mathematics as a science, since it does not require an experimental test of its
  theories and hypotheses. Mathematical theorems and formulas are obtained by logical
  derivations which presume axiomatic systems, rather than the combination of empirical
  observation and logical reasoning that has come to be known as the scientific method.
  In general, mathematics is classified as formal science, while natural and social
  sciences are classified as empirical sciences.[35]\nScientific community\nMain article:
  Scientific community\nThe scientific community is the group of all interacting scientists.
  It includes many sub-communities working on particular scientific fields, and within
  particular institutions; interdisciplinary and cross-institutional activities are
  also significant.\nBranches and fields\nMain article: Branches of science\n\n\n\n\nThe
  somatosensory system is located throughout our bodies but is integrated in the brain.\n\n\nScientific
  fields are commonly divided into two major groups: natural sciences, which study
  natural phenomena (including biological life), and social sciences, which study
  human behavior and societies. These groupings are empirical sciences, which means
  the knowledge must be based on observable phenomena and capable of being tested
  for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions.[36] There
  are also related disciplines that are grouped into interdisciplinary applied sciences,
  such as engineering and medicine. Within these categories are specialized scientific
  fields that can include parts of other scientific disciplines but often possess
  their own nomenclature and expertise.[37]\nMathematics, which is classified as a
  formal science,[38][39] has both similarities and differences with the empirical
  sciences (the natural and social sciences). It is similar to empirical sciences
  in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge;
  it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using a priori
  rather than empirical methods.[40] The formal sciences, which also include statistics
  and logic, are vital to the empirical sciences. Major advances in formal science
  have often led to major advances in the empirical sciences. The formal sciences
  are essential in the formation of hypotheses, theories, and laws,[41] both in discovering
  and describing how things work (natural sciences) and how people think and act (social
  sciences).\nApart from its broad meaning, the word \"Science\" sometimes may specifically
  refer to fundamental sciences (maths and natural sciences) alone. Science schools
  or faculties within many institutions are separate from those for medicine or engineering,
  which is an applied science.\nInstitutions\nLearned societies for the communication
  and promotion of scientific thought and experimentation have existed since the Renaissance
  period.[42] The oldest surviving institution is the Italian Accademia dei Lincei
  which was established in 1603.[43] The respective National Academies of Science
  are distinguished institutions that exist in a number of countries, beginning with
  the British Royal Society in 1660[44] and the French Académie des Sciences in 1666.[45]\nInternational
  scientific organizations, such as the International Council for Science, have since
  been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different
  nations. Many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research.
  Prominent scientific organizations include, the National Science Foundation in the
  U.S., the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina, the academies
  of science of many nations, CSIRO in Australia, Centre national de la recherche
  scientifique in France, Max Planck Society and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft in
  Germany, and in Spain, CSIC.\nLiterature\nMain article: Scientific literature\nAn
  enormous range of scientific literature is published.[46]Scientific journals communicate
  and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other
  research institutions, serving as an archival record of science. The first scientific
  journals, Journal des Sçavans followed by the Philosophical Transactions, began
  publication in 1665. Since that time the total number of active periodicals has
  steadily increased. In 1981, one estimate for the number of scientific and technical
  journals in publication was 11,500.[47] The United States National Library of Medicine
  currently indexes 5,516 journals that contain articles on topics related to the
  life sciences. Although the journals are in 39 languages, 91 percent of the indexed
  articles are published in English.[48]\nMost scientific journals cover a single
  scientific field and publish the research within that field; the research is normally
  expressed in the form of a scientific paper. Science has become so pervasive in
  modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements,
  news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace.\nScience magazines such as
  New Scientist, Science & Vie, and Scientific American cater to the needs of a much
  wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas of research,
  including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research. Science
  books engage the interest of many more people. Tangentially, the science fiction
  genre, primarily fantastic in nature, engages the public imagination and transmits
  the ideas, if not the methods, of science.\nRecent efforts to intensify or develop
  links between science and non-scientific disciplines such as Literature or, more
  specifically, Poetry, include the Creative Writing Science resource developed through
  the Royal Literary Fund.[49]\nScience and society\nWomen in science\nMain article:
  Women in science\nScience has traditionally been a male-dominated field, with some
  notable exceptions.[nb 14] Women historically faced considerable discrimination
  in science, much as they did in other areas of male-dominated societies, such as
  frequently being passed over for job opportunities and denied credit for their work.[nb
  15] For example, Christine Ladd (1847–1930) was able to enter a Ph.D. program as
  'C. Ladd'; Christine \"Kitty\" Ladd completed the requirements in 1882, but was
  awarded her degree only in 1926, after a career which spanned the algebra of logic
  (see truth table), color vision, and psychology. Her work preceded notable researchers
  like Ludwig Wittgenstein and Charles Sanders Peirce. The achievements of women in
  science have been attributed to their defiance of their traditional role as laborers
  within the domestic sphere.[50]\nIn the late 20th century, active recruitment of
  women and elimination of institutional discrimination on the basis of sex greatly
  increased the number of female scientists, but large gender disparities remain in
  some fields; over half of new biologists are female, while 80% of PhDs in physics
  are given to men. Feminists claim this is the result of culture rather than an innate
  difference between the sexes, and some experiments have shown that parents challenge
  and explain more to boys than girls, asking them to reflect more deeply and logically.[51]
  In the early part of the 21st century, in America, women earned 50.3% bachelor's
  degrees, 45.6% master's degrees, and 40.7% of PhDs in science and engineering fields
  with women earning more than half of the degrees in three fields: Psychology (about
  70%), Social Sciences (about 50%), and Biology (about 50-60%). However, when it
  comes to the Physical Sciences, Geosciences, Math, Engineering, and Computer Science;
  women earned less than half the degrees.[52] However, lifestyle choice also plays
  a major role in female engagement in science; women with young children are 28%
  less likely to take tenure-track positions due to work-life balance issues,[53]
  and female graduate students' interest in careers in research declines dramatically
  over the course of graduate school, whereas that of their male colleagues remains
  unchanged.[54]\nScience policy\nMain articles: Science policy, History of science
  policy, Funding of science and Economics of science\n\n\n\n\nPresident Clinton meets
  the 1998 U.S. Nobel Prize winners in the White House\n\n\nScience policy is an area
  of public policy concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific
  enterprise, including research funding, often in pursuance of other national policy
  goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development,
  weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring. Science policy also
  refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development
  of public policies. Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that
  involve the natural sciences. In accordance with public policy being concerned about
  the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to consider how science
  and technology can best serve the public.\nState policy has influenced the funding
  of public works and science for thousands of years, dating at least from the time
  of the Mohists, who inspired the study of logic during the period of the Hundred
  Schools of Thought, and the study of defensive fortifications during the Warring
  States period in China. In Great Britain, governmental approval of the Royal Society
  in the 17th century recognized a scientific community which exists to this day.
  The professionalization of science, begun in the 19th century, was partly enabled
  by the creation of scientific organizations such as the National Academy of Sciences,
  the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, and State funding of universities of their respective
  nations. Public policy can directly affect the funding of capital equipment, intellectual
  infrastructure for industrial research, by providing tax incentives to those organizations
  that fund research. Vannevar Bush, director of the Office of Scientific Research
  and Development for the United States government, the forerunner of the National
  Science Foundation, wrote in July 1945 that \"Science is a proper concern of government\".[55]\nScience
  and technology research is often funded through a competitive process, in which
  potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding.
  Such processes, which are run by government, corporations or foundations, allocate
  scarce funds. Total research funding in most developed countries is between 1.5%
  and 3% of GDP.[56] In the OECD, around two-thirds of research and development in
  scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 20% and 10% respectively
  by universities and government. The government funding proportion in certain industries
  is higher, and it dominates research in social science and humanities. Similarly,
  with some exceptions (e.g. biotechnology) government provides the bulk of the funds
  for basic scientific research. In commercial research and development, all but the
  most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation
  possibilities rather than \"blue-sky\" ideas or technologies (such as nuclear fusion).\nMedia
  perspectives\nThe mass media face a number of pressures that can prevent them from
  accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within
  the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different
  sides in a scientific debate may require considerable expertise regarding the matter.[57]
  Few journalists have real scientific knowledge, and even beat reporters who know
  a great deal about certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific
  issues that they are suddenly asked to cover.[58][59]\nPolitical usage\nSee also:
  Politicization of science\nMany issues damage the relationship of science to the
  media and the use of science and scientific arguments by politicians. As a very
  broad generalisation, many politicians seek certainties and facts whilst scientists
  typically offer probabilities and caveats. However, politicians' ability to be heard
  in the mass media frequently distorts the scientific understanding by the public.
  Examples in Britain include the controversy over the MMR inoculation, and the 1988
  forced resignation of a Government Minister, Edwina Currie for revealing the high
  probability that battery farmed eggs were contaminated with Salmonella.[60]\nJohn
  Horgan, Chris Mooney, and researchers from the US and Canada have described Scientific
  Certainty Argumentation Methods (SCAMs), where an organization or think tank makes
  it their only goal to cast doubt on supported science because it conflicts with
  political agendas.[61][62][63][64] Hank Campbell and microbiologist Alex Berezow
  have described \"feel-good fallacies\" used in politics, where politicians frame
  their positions in a way that makes people feel good about supporting certain policies
  even when scientific evidence shows there is no need to worry or there is no need
  for dramatic change on current programs.[65]\nScience and the public\nVarious activities
  are developed to approximate the general public and science/scientists, such as
  in science outreach, public awareness of science, science communication, science
  festivals, citizen science, science journalism, public science, popular science,
  etc.; see Science and the public for related concepts. Science is represented by
  the 'S' in STEM fields.\nPhilosophy of science\nMain article: Philosophy of science\n\n\n\nThe
  following text needs to be harmonized with text in Philosophy of science. (February
  2014)\nWorking scientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that
  are needed to justify the scientific method: (1) that there is an objective reality
  shared by all rational observers; (2) that this objective reality is governed by
  natural laws; (3) that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation
  and experimentation.[8] Philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what
  these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid.\nThe belief that scientific
  theories should and do represent metaphysical reality is known as realism. It can
  be contrasted with anti-realism, the view that the success of science does not depend
  on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as electrons. One form of
  anti-realism is idealism, the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most
  basic essence, and that each mind generates its own reality.[nb 16] In an idealistic
  world view, what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds.\n\n\n\n\nThe
  Sand Reckoner is a work by Archimedes in which he sets out to determine an upper
  bound for the number of grains of sand that fit into the universe. In order to do
  this, he had to estimate the size of the universe according to the contemporary
  model, and invent a way to analyze extremely large numbers.\n\n\nThere are different
  schools of thought in philosophy of science. The most popular position is empiricism,[nb
  17] which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and
  that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations.[66]
  Empiricism generally encompasses inductivism, a position that tries to explain the
  way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans
  can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm
  scientific theories. This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories
  make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of
  evidence using deductive logic only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the
  predominant ones being bayesianism[67] and the hypothetico-deductive method.[68]:p236\nEmpiricism
  has stood in contrast to rationalism, the position originally associated with Descartes,
  which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation.[68]:p20Critical
  rationalism is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by
  Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper. Popper rejected the way that empiricism
  describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories
  are not generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of theories
  and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in
  conflict with it.[68]:pp63–7 Popper proposed replacing verifiability with falsifiability
  as the landmark of scientific theories, and replacing induction with falsification
  as the empirical method.[68]:p68 Popper further claimed that there is actually only
  one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism,
  trial and error.[69] It covers all products of the human mind, including science,
  mathematics, philosophy, and art.[70]\nAnother approach, instrumentalism, colloquially
  termed \"shut up and calculate\", emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments
  for explaining and predicting phenomena.[71] It views scientific theories as black
  boxes with only their input (initial conditions) and output (predictions) being
  relevant. Consequences, theoretical entities and logical structure are claimed to
  be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn't make a
  fuss about (see interpretations of quantum mechanics). Close to instrumentalism
  is constructive empiricism, according to which the main criterion for the success
  of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true.\nPaul
  K Feyerabend advanced the idea of epistemological anarchism, which holds that there
  are no useful and exception-free methodological rules governing the progress of
  science or the growth of knowledge, and that the idea that science can or should
  operate according to universal and fixed rules is unrealistic, pernicious and detrimental
  to science itself.[72] Feyerabend advocates treating science as an ideology alongside
  others such as religion, magic and mythology, and considers the dominance of science
  in society authoritarian and unjustified. He also contended (along with Imre Lakatos)[discuss]
  that the demarcation problem of distinguishing science from pseudoscience on objective
  grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according
  to fixed, universal rules.[72] Feyerabend also stated that science does not have
  evidence for its philosophical precepts, particularly the notion of Uniformity of
  Law and the Uniformity of Process across time and space.[73]\nFinally, another approach
  often cited in debates of scientific skepticism against controversial movements
  like \"scientific creationism\", is methodological naturalism. Its main point is
  that a difference between natural and supernatural explanations should be made,
  and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations.[nb
  18] That the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means
  that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not
  claim them to be wrong either. Instead, supernatural explanations should be left
  a matter of personal belief outside the scope of science. Methodological naturalism
  maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to empirical study and independent
  verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for
  observable phenomena.[74] The absence of these standards, arguments from authority,
  biased observational studies and other common fallacies are frequently cited by
  supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non-science they
  criticize.\nCertainty and science\n\n\n\n\nThe DNA double helix is a molecule that
  encodes the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all
  known living organisms and many viruses.\n\n\nA scientific theory is empirical,[nb
  17][75] and is always open to falsification if new evidence is presented. That is,
  no theory is ever considered strictly certain as science accepts the concept of
  fallibilism.[nb 19] The philosopher of science Karl Popper sharply distinguishes
  truth from certainty. He writes that scientific knowledge \"consists in the search
  for truth\", but it \"is not the search for certainty ... All human knowledge is
  fallible and therefore uncertain.\"[76]:p4\nNew scientific knowledge rarely results
  in vast changes in our understanding. According to psychologist Keith Stanovich,
  it may be the media's overuse of words like \"breakthrough\" that leads the public
  to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to
  be false.[77]:119–138 While there are such famous cases as the theory of relativity
  that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions. Knowledge
  in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments,
  by various researchers, across different branches of science; it is more like a
  climb than a leap.[77]:123 Theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested
  and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community.[nb 20] For
  example, heliocentric theory, the theory of evolution, relativity theory, and germ
  theory still bear the name \"theory\" even though, in practice, they are considered
  factual.[78] Philosopher Barry Stroud adds that, although the best definition for
  \"knowledge\" is contested, being skeptical and entertaining the possibility that
  one is incorrect is compatible with being correct. Ironically then, the scientist
  adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess
  the truth.[79] The fallibilist C. S. Peirce argued that inquiry is the struggle
  to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome, verbal, or hyperbolic doubt
  is fruitless[80]—but also that the inquirer should try to attain genuine doubt rather
  than resting uncritically on common sense.[81] He held that the successful sciences
  trust, not to any single chain of inference (no stronger than its weakest link),
  but to the cable of multiple and various arguments intimately connected.[82]\nStanovich
  also asserts that science avoids searching for a \"magic bullet\"; it avoids the
  single-cause fallacy. This means a scientist would not ask merely \"What is the
  cause of ...\", but rather \"What are the most significant causes of ...\". This
  is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science (e.g. psychology,
  cosmology).[77]:141–147 Of course, research often analyzes few factors at once,
  but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to
  consider.[77]:141–147 For example: knowing the details of only a person's genetics,
  or their history and upbringing, or the current situation may not explain a behaviour,
  but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive.\nFringe
  science, pseudoscience and junk science\nAn area of study or speculation that masquerades
  as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able
  to achieve is sometimes referred to as pseudoscience, fringe science, or junk science.[nb
  21] Physicist Richard Feynman coined the term \"cargo cult science\" for cases in
  which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities have the
  outward appearance of science but actually lack the \"kind of utter honesty\" that
  allows their results to be rigorously evaluated.[83] Various types of commercial
  advertising, ranging from hype to fraud, may fall into these categories.\nThere
  also can be[discuss] an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of
  scientific debates.[citation needed] Sometimes, research may be characterized as
  \"bad science\", research that may be well-intentioned but is actually incorrect,
  obsolete, incomplete, or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas. The term
  \"scientific misconduct\" refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally
  misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery
  to the wrong person.[84]\nScientific practice\n\n\n\n\nAstronomy became much more
  accurate after Tycho Brahe devised his scientific instruments for measuring angles
  between two celestial bodies, before the invention of the telescope. Brahe's observations
  were the basis for Kepler's laws.\n\n\nAlthough encyclopedias such as Pliny (fl.
  77 AD) Natural History offered purported fact, they proved unreliable. A skeptical
  point of view, demanding a method of proof, was the practical position taken to
  deal with unreliable knowledge. As early as 1000 years ago, scholars such as Alhazen
  (Doubts Concerning Ptolemy), Roger Bacon, Witelo, John Pecham, Francis Bacon (1605),
  and C. S. Peirce (1839–1914) provided the community to address these points of uncertainty.
  In particular, fallacious reasoning can be exposed, such as 'affirming the consequent'.\n\n\"If
  a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content
  to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties.\" —Francis Bacon (1605) The Advancement
  of Learning, Book 1, v, 8\n\nThe methods of inquiry into a problem have been known
  for thousands of years,[85] and extend beyond theory to practice. The use of measurements,
  for example, is a practical approach to settle disputes in the community.\nJohn
  Ziman points out that intersubjective pattern recognition is fundamental to the
  creation of all scientific knowledge.[86]:p44 Ziman shows how scientists can identify
  patterns to each other across centuries: Ziman refers to this ability as 'perceptual
  consensibility'.[87]:p46 Ziman then makes consensibility, leading to consensus,
  the touchstone of reliable knowledge.[87]:p104\n\nBasic and applied research\n\n\n\n\nAnthropogenic
  pollution has an effect on the Earth's environment and climate\n\n\nAlthough some
  scientific research is applied research into specific problems, a great deal of
  our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of basic research.
  This leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes
  even imaginable. This point was made by Michael Faraday when, allegedly in response
  to the question \"what is the use of basic research?\" he responded \"Sir, what
  is the use of a new-born child?\".[88] For example, research into the effects of
  red light on the human eye's rod cells did not seem to have any practical purpose;
  eventually, the discovery that our night vision is not troubled by red light would
  lead search and rescue teams (among others) to adopt red light in the cockpits of
  jets and helicopters.[77]:106–110 In a nutshell: Basic research is the search for
  knowledge. Applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using
  this knowledge. Finally, even basic research can take unexpected turns, and there
  is some sense in which the scientific method is built to harness luck.\nResearch
  in practice\nDue to the increasing complexity of information and specialization
  of scientists, most of the cutting-edge research today is done by well funded groups
  of scientists, rather than individuals.[89] D.K. Simonton notes that due to the
  breadth of very precise and far reaching tools already used by researchers today
  and the amount of research generated so far, creation of new disciplines or revolutions
  within a discipline may no longer be possible as it is unlikely that some phenomenon
  that merits its own discipline has been overlooked. Hybridizing of disciplines and
  finessing knowledge is, in his view, the future of science.[89]\nPractical impacts

  eclipses of the sun were impossible, because there were historical accounts of total
  eclipses. Instead he deduced that the size of the aperture controls the sharpness
  of the projected image (the larger the aperture, the more accurate the image — this
  fact is now fundamental for optical system design). Voelkel, p.61, notes that Kepler's
  experiments produced the first correct account of vision and the eye, because he
  realized he could not accurately write about astronomical observation by ignoring
  the eye.\n\n^ di Francia 1976, p. 13: \"The amazing point is that for the first
  time since the discovery of mathematics, a method has been introduced, the results
  of which have an intersubjective value!\" (Author's punctuation)\n^ di Francia 1976,
  pp. 4–5: \"One learns in a laboratory; one learns how to make experiments only by
  experimenting, and one learns how to work with his hands only by using them. The
  first and fundamental form of experimentation in physics is to teach young people
  to work with their hands. Then they should be taken into a laboratory and taught
  to work with measuring instruments — each student carrying out real experiments
  in physics. This form of teaching is indispensable and cannot be read in a book.\"\n^
  Fara 2009, p. 204: \"Whatever their discipline, scientists claimed to share a common
  scientific method that ... distinguished them from non-scientists.\"\n^ Women in
  science have included:\nHypatia (c. 350–415 CE), of the Library of Alexandria.\nTrotula
  of Salerno, a physician c. 1060 CE.\nCaroline Herschel one of the first professional
  astronomers of the 18th and 19th centuries.\nChristine Ladd-Franklin, a doctoral
  student of C. S. Peirce, who published Wittgenstein's proposition 5.101 in her dissertation,
  40 years before Wittgenstein's publication of Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.\nHenrietta
  Leavitt, a professional human computer and astronomer, who first published the significant
  relationship between the luminosity of Cepheid variable stars and their distance
  from Earth. This allowed Hubble to make the discovery of the expanding universe,
  which led to the Big Bang theory.\nEmmy Noether, who proved the conservation of
  energy and other constants of motion in 1915.\nMarie Curie, who made discoveries
  relating to radioactivity along with her husband, and for whom Curium is named.\nRosalind
  Franklin, who worked with x-ray diffraction.\n\n^ Nina Byers,Contributions of 20th
  Century Women to Physics which provides details on 83 female physicists of the 20th
  century. By 1976, more women were physicists, and the 83 who were detailed were
  joined by other women in noticeably larger numbers.\n^ This realization is the topic
  of intersubjective verifiability, as recounted, for example, by Max Born (1949,
  1965) Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance, who points out that all knowledge,
  including natural or social science, is also subjective. p. 162: \"Thus it dawned
  upon me that fundamentally everything is subjective, everything without exception.
  That was a shock.\"\n^ a b In his investigation of the law of falling bodies, Galileo
  (1638) serves as example for scientific investigation: Two New Sciences \"A piece
  of wooden moulding or scantling, about 12 cubits long, half a cubit wide, and three
  finger-breadths thick, was taken; on its edge was cut a channel a little more than
  one finger in breadth; having made this groove very straight, smooth, and polished,
  and having lined it with parchment, also as smooth and polished as possible, we
  rolled along it a hard, smooth, and very round bronze ball. Having placed this board
  in a sloping position, by lifting one end some one or two cubits above the other,
  we rolled the ball, as I was just saying, along the channel, noting, in a manner
  presently to be described, the time required to make the descent. We . . . now rolled
  the ball only one-quarter the length of the channel; and having measured the time
  of its descent, we found it precisely one-half of the former. Next we tried other
  distances, comparing the time for the whole length with that for the half, or with
  that for two-thirds, or three-fourths, or indeed for any fraction; in such experiments,
  repeated many, many, times.\" Galileo solved the problem of time measurement by
  weighing a jet of water collected during the descent of the bronze ball, as stated
  in his Two New Sciences.\n^ Godfrey-Smith 2003, p. 151 credits Willard Van Orman
  Quine (1969) \"Epistemology Naturalized\" Ontological Relativity and Other Essays
  New York: Columbia University Press, as well as John Dewey, with the basic ideas
  of naturalism — Naturalized Epistemology, but Godfrey-Smith diverges from Quine's
  position: according to Godfrey-Smith, \"A naturalist can think that science can
  contribute to answers to philosophical questions, without thinking that philosophical
  questions can be replaced by science questions.\".\n^ \"No amount of experimentation

  The Stanford article states: \"Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that
  pseudoscience is non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the
  subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science.
  According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), \"[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs
  is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones.\" These and many other authors
  assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the
  following two criteria (Hansson 1996): (1) it is not scientific, and (2) its major
  proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific\".\nFor example, Hewitt

  to describe and interpret observed and inferred phenomena, past or present, and
  aimed at building a testable body of knowledge open to rejection or confirmation\"(p.

  /* @nomin */\n} );Science[nb 1] is a systematic enterprise that creates, builds
  and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about
  the universe.[nb 2][2]:58Contemporary science is typically subdivided into the natural
  sciences which study the material world, the social sciences which study people
  and societies, and the formal sciences like mathematics. The formal sciences are
  often excluded as they do not depend on empirical observations.[3] Disciplines which
  use science like engineering and medicine may also be considered to be applied sciences.[4]From
  classical antiquity through the 19th century, science as a type of knowledge was
  more closely linked to philosophy than it is now and, in fact, in the West the term
  \"natural philosophy\" encompassed fields of study that are today associated with
  science such as physics, astronomy, medicine, among many others.[5]:3[nb 3]In the
  17th and 18th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in
  terms of laws of nature. Over the course of the 19th century, the word \"science\"
  became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself, as a disciplined
  way to study the natural world. It was in the 19th century that modern scientific
  disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and biology reached their modern shapes.
  The same time period also included the origin of the terms \"scientist\" and \"scientific
  community,\" the founding of scientific institutions, and increasing significance
  of the interactions with society and other aspects of culture.[6][7]Science in a
  broad sense existed before the modern era, and in many historical civilizations.[nb
  4]Modern science is distinct in its approach and successful in its results: 'modern
  science' now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term.[8]Science
  in its original sense is a word for a type of knowledge, rather than a specialized
  word for the pursuit of such knowledge. In particular it is one of the types of
  knowledge which people can communicate to each other and share. For example, knowledge
  about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and
  led to the development of complex abstract thinking. This is shown by the construction
  of complex calendars, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, and buildings
  such as the pyramids. However no consistent conscientious distinction was made between
  knowledge of such things which are true in every community and other types of communal
  knowledge, such as mythologies and legal systems.Before the invention or discovery
  of the concept of \"nature\" (Ancient Greek phusis), by the Pre-Socratic philosophers,
  the same words tend to be used to describe the natural \"way\" in which a plant
  grows,[9] and the \"way\" in which, for example, one tribe worships a particular
  god. For this reason it is claimed these men were the first philosophers in the
  strict sense, and also the first people to clearly distinguish \"nature\" and \"convention\".[10]
  Science was therefore distinguished as the knowledge of nature, and the things which
  are true for every community, and the name of the specialized pursuit of such knowledge
  was philosophy — the realm of the first philosopher-physicists. They were mainly
  speculators or theorists, particularly interested in astronomy. In contrast, trying
  to use knowledge of nature to imitate nature (artifice or technology, Greek technē)
  was seen by classical scientists as a more appropriate interest for lower class
  artisans.[11] A clear-cut distinction between formal (eon) and empirical science
  (doxa) was made by pre-Socratic philosopher Parmenides (fl. late sixth or early
  fifth century BCE). Although his work peri physeos is a poem, it may be viewed as
  an epistemological essay, an essay on method in natural science. Parmenides' ἐὸν
  may refer to a formal system, a calculus which can describe nature more precisely
  than natural languages. 'Physis' may be identical to ἐὸν.[12]A major turning point
  in the history of early philosophical science was the controversial but successful
  attempt by Socrates to apply philosophy to the study of human things, including
  human nature, the nature of political communities, and human knowledge itself. He
  criticized the older type of study of physics as too purely speculative, and lacking
  in self-criticism. He was particularly concerned that some of the early physicists
  treated nature as if it could be assumed that it had no intelligent order, explaining
  things merely in terms of motion and matter. The study of human things had been
  the realm of mythology and tradition, and Socrates was executed.[14]Aristotle later
  created a less controversial systematic programme of Socratic philosophy, which
  was teleological, and human-centred. He rejected many of the conclusions of earlier
  scientists. For example, in his physics the sun goes around the earth, and many
  things have it as part of their nature that they are for humans. Each thing has
  a formal cause and final cause and a role in the rational cosmic order. Motion and
  change is described as the actualization of potentials already in things, according
  to what types of things they are. While the Socratics insisted that philosophy should
  be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being
  (a study Aristotle divided into ethics and political philosophy), they did not argue
  for any other types of applied science.Aristotle maintained the sharp distinction
  between science and the practical knowledge of artisans, treating theoretical speculation
  as the highest type of human activity, practical thinking about good living as something
  less lofty, and the knowledge of artisans as something only suitable for the lower
  classes. In contrast to modern science, Aristotle's influential emphasis was upon
  the \"theoretical\" steps of deducing universal rules from raw data, and did not
  treat the gathering of experience and raw data as part of science itself.[nb 5]During
  late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, the Aristotelian approach to inquiries
  on natural phenomena was used. Some ancient knowledge was lost, or in some cases
  kept in obscurity, during the fall of the Roman Empire and periodic political struggles.
  However, the general fields of science, or \"natural philosophy\" as it was called,
  and much of the general knowledge from the ancient world remained preserved though
  the works of the early Latin encyclopedists like Isidore of Seville. Also, in the
  Byzantine empire, many Greek science texts were preserved in Syriac translations
  done by groups such as Nestorians and Monophysites.[17] Many of these were translated
  later on into Arabic under the Caliphate, during which many types of classical learning
  were preserved and in some cases improved upon.[17][nb 7] The House of Wisdom was
  established in Abbasid-era Baghdad, Iraq.[18] It is considered to have been a major
  intellectual center, during the Islamic Golden Age, where Muslim scholars such as
  al-Kindi and Ibn Sahl in Baghdad, and Ibn al-Haytham in Cairo, flourished from the
  ninth to the thirteenth centuries, until the Mongol sack of Baghdad. Ibn al-Haytham,
  known later to the West as Alhazen, furthered the Aristotelian viewpoint,[19] by
  emphasizing experimental data.[nb 8][20] In the later medieval period, as demand
  for translations grew, for example from the Toledo School of Translators, Western
  Europeans began collecting texts written not only in Latin, but also Latin translations
  from Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew. The texts of Aristotle, Ptolemy,[nb 9] and Euclid,
  preserved in the Houses of Wisdom, were sought amongst Catholic scholars. In Europe,
  Alhazen's De Aspectibus directly influenced Roger Bacon (13th century) in England,
  who argued for more experimental science, as demonstrated by Alhazen. By the late
  Middle Ages, a synthesis of Catholicism and Aristotelianism known as Scholasticism
  was flourishing in Western Europe, which had become a new geographic center of science,
  but all aspects of scholasticism were criticized in the 15th and 16th centuries.Medieval
  science carried on the views of the Hellenist civilization of Socrates, Plato, and
  Aristotle, as shown by Alhazen's lost work A Book in which I have Summarized the
  Science of Optics from the Two Books of Euclid and Ptolemy, to which I have added
  the Notions of the First Discourse which is Missing from Ptolemy's Book from Ibn
  Abi Usaibia's catalog, as cited in (Smith 2001).:91(vol.1),p.xv Alhazen conclusively
  disproved Ptolemy's theory of vision.But Alhacen retained Aristotle's ontology;
  Roger Bacon, Witelo, and John Peckham each built-up a scholastic ontology upon Alhazen's
  Book of Optics, a causal chain beginning with sensation, perception, and finally
  apperception of the individual and universal forms of Aristotle.[21] This model
  of vision became known as Perspectivism, which was exploited and studied by the
  artists of the Renaissance.A. Mark Smith points out the perspectivist theory of
  vision \"is remarkably economical, reasonable, and coherent\", which pivots on three
  of Aristotle's four causes, formal, material, and final.[22] Although Alhacen knew
  that a scene imaged through an aperture is inverted, he argued that vision is about
  perception. This was overturned by Kepler,[23]:p.102 who modelled the eye with a
  water-filled glass sphere, with an aperture in front of it to model the entrance
  pupil. He found that all the light from a single point of the scene was imaged at
  a single point at the back of the glass sphere. The optical chain ends on the retina
  at the back of the eye and the image is inverted.[nb 10]Copernicus formulated a
  heliocentric model of the solar system unlike the geocentric model of Ptolemy's
  Almagest.Galileo made innovative use of experiment and mathematics. However his
  persecution began after Pope Urban VIII blessed Galileo to write about the Copernican
  system. Galileo had used arguments from the Pope and put them in the voice of the
  simpleton in the work \"Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems\" which
  caused great offense to him.[25]In Northern Europe, the new technology of the printing
  press was widely used to publish many arguments including some that disagreed with
  church dogma. René Descartes and Francis Bacon published philosophical arguments
  in favor of a new type of non-Aristotelian science. Descartes argued that mathematics
  could be used in order to study nature, as Galileo had done, and Bacon emphasized
  the importance of experiment over contemplation. Bacon questioned the Aristotelian
  concepts of formal cause and final cause, and promoted the idea that science should
  study the laws of \"simple\" natures, such as heat, rather than assuming that there
  is any specific nature, or \"formal cause\", of each complex type of thing. This
  new modern science began to see itself as describing \"laws of nature\". This updated
  approach to studies in nature was seen as mechanistic. Bacon also argued that science
  should aim for the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all
  human life.In the 17th and 18th centuries, the project of modernity, as had been
  promoted by Bacon and Descartes, led to rapid scientific advance and the successful
  development of a new type of natural science, mathematical, methodically experimental,
  and deliberately innovative. Newton and Leibniz succeeded in developing a new physics,
  now referred to as Newtonian physics, which could be confirmed by experiment and
  explained using mathematics. Leibniz also incorporated terms from Aristotelian physics,
  but now being used in a new non-teleological way, for example \"energy\" and \"potential\"
  (modern versions of Aristotelian \"energeia and potentia\"). In the style of Bacon,
  he assumed that different types of things all work according to the same general
  laws of nature, with no special formal or final causes for each type of thing. It
  is during this period that the word \"science\" gradually became more commonly used
  to refer to a type of pursuit of a type of knowledge, especially knowledge of nature —
  coming close in meaning to the old term \"natural philosophy\".Both John Herschel
  and William Whewell systematized methodology: the latter coined the term scientist.
  When Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species he established descent with
  modification as the prevailing evolutionary explanation of biological complexity.
  His theory of natural selection provided a natural explanation of how species originated,
  but this only gained wide acceptance a century later. John Dalton developed the
  idea of atoms. The laws of thermodynamics and the electromagnetic theory were also
  established in the 19th century, which raised new questions which could not easily
  be answered using Newton's framework. The phenomena that would allow the deconstruction
  of the atom were discovered in the last decade of the 19th century: the discovery
  of X-rays inspired the discovery of radioactivity. In the next year came the discovery
  of the first subatomic particle, the electron.Einstein's Theory of Relativity and
  the development of quantum mechanics led to the replacement of Newtonian physics
  with a new physics which contains two parts, that describe different types of events
  in nature.In the first half of the century the development of artificial fertilizer
  made possible global human population growth. At the same time, the structure of
  the atom and its nucleus was elucidated, leading to the release of \"atomic energy\"
  (nuclear power). In addition, the extensive use of scientific innovation, stimulated
  by the wars of this century, led to antibiotics and increased life expectancy, revolutions
  in transportation (automobiles and aircraft), and the development of ICBMs, a space
  race, and a nuclear arms race— all giving a widespread public appreciation of the
  importance of modern science.Widespread use of integrated circuits in the last quarter
  of the 20th century, combined with communications satellites, led to a revolution
  in information technology, and the rise of the global internet and mobile computing,
  including smartphones.More recently, it has been argued that the ultimate purpose
  of science is to make sense of human beings and our nature – for example in his
  book Consilience, EO Wilson said \"The human condition is the most important frontier
  of the natural sciences.\" [2]:334The scientific method seeks to explain the events
  of nature in a reproducible way.[nb 11] An explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis
  is put forward, as explanation, using principles such as parsimony (also known as
  \"Occam's Razor\") and are generally expected to seek consilience—fitting well with
  other accepted facts related to the phenomena.[2][dubious – discuss] This new explanation
  is used to make falsifiable predictions that are testable by experiment or observation.
  The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is
  sought, as proof that no tampering has occurred. Disproof of a prediction is evidence
  of progress.[nb 12][nb 13] This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena,
  but also through experimentation, that tries to simulate natural events under controlled
  conditions, as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences, such
  as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled
  experiment). Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish
  causal relationships (to avoid the correlation fallacy).When a hypothesis proves
  unsatisfactory, it is either modified or discarded.[26] If the hypothesis survived
  testing, it may become adopted into the framework of a scientific theory. This is
  a logically reasoned, self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior
  of certain natural phenomena. A theory typically describes the behavior of much
  broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis; commonly, a large number of hypotheses
  can be logically bound together by a single theory. Thus a theory is a hypothesis
  explaining various other hypotheses. In that vein, theories are formulated according
  to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses. In addition to testing
  hypotheses, scientists may also generate a model based on observed phenomena. This
  is an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical, physical
  or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested.[27]While
  performing experiments to test hypotheses, scientists may have a preference for
  one outcome over another, and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole
  can eliminate this bias.[28][29] This can be achieved by careful experimental design,
  transparency, and a thorough peer review process of the experimental results as
  well as any conclusions.[30][31] After the results of an experiment are announced
  or published, it is normal practice for independent researchers to double-check
  how the research was performed, and to follow up by performing similar experiments
  to determine how dependable the results might be.[32] Taken in its entirety, the
  scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any
  effects of subjective bias on the part of its users (namely the confirmation bias).[33]Mathematics
  is essential to the sciences. One important function of mathematics in science is
  the role it plays in the expression of scientific models. Observing and collecting
  measurements, as well as hypothesizing and predicting, often require extensive use
  of mathematics. Arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry and calculus, for example,
  are all essential to physics. Virtually every branch of mathematics has applications
  in science, including \"pure\" areas such as number theory and topology.Statistical
  methods, which are mathematical techniques for summarizing and analyzing data, allow
  scientists to assess the level of reliability and the range of variation in experimental
  results. Statistical analysis plays a fundamental role in many areas of both the
  natural sciences and social sciences.Computational science applies computing power
  to simulate real-world situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific
  problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve. According to the Society for
  Industrial and Applied Mathematics, computation is now as important as theory and
  experiment in advancing scientific knowledge.[34]Whether mathematics itself is properly
  classified as science has been a matter of some debate. Some thinkers see mathematicians
  as scientists, regarding physical experiments as inessential or mathematical proofs
  as equivalent to experiments. Others do not see mathematics as a science, since
  it does not require an experimental test of its theories and hypotheses. Mathematical
  theorems and formulas are obtained by logical derivations which presume axiomatic
  systems, rather than the combination of empirical observation and logical reasoning
  that has come to be known as the scientific method. In general, mathematics is classified
  as formal science, while natural and social sciences are classified as empirical
  sciences.[35]The scientific community is the group of all interacting scientists.
  It includes many sub-communities working on particular scientific fields, and within
  particular institutions; interdisciplinary and cross-institutional activities are
  also significant.Scientific fields are commonly divided into two major groups: natural
  sciences, which study natural phenomena (including biological life), and social
  sciences, which study human behavior and societies. These groupings are empirical
  sciences, which means the knowledge must be based on observable phenomena and capable
  of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions.[36]
  There are also related disciplines that are grouped into interdisciplinary applied
  sciences, such as engineering and medicine. Within these categories are specialized
  scientific fields that can include parts of other scientific disciplines but often
  possess their own nomenclature and expertise.[37]Mathematics, which is classified
  as a formal science,[38][39] has both similarities and differences with the empirical
  sciences (the natural and social sciences). It is similar to empirical sciences
  in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge;
  it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using a priori
  rather than empirical methods.[40] The formal sciences, which also include statistics
  and logic, are vital to the empirical sciences. Major advances in formal science
  have often led to major advances in the empirical sciences. The formal sciences
  are essential in the formation of hypotheses, theories, and laws,[41] both in discovering
  and describing how things work (natural sciences) and how people think and act (social
  sciences).Apart from its broad meaning, the word \"Science\" sometimes may specifically
  refer to fundamental sciences (maths and natural sciences) alone. Science schools
  or faculties within many institutions are separate from those for medicine or engineering,
  which is an applied science.Learned societies for the communication and promotion
  of scientific thought and experimentation have existed since the Renaissance period.[42]
  The oldest surviving institution is the Italian Accademia dei Lincei which was established
  in 1603.[43] The respective National Academies of Science are distinguished institutions
  that exist in a number of countries, beginning with the British Royal Society in
  1660[44] and the French Académie des Sciences in 1666.[45]International scientific
  organizations, such as the International Council for Science, have since been formed
  to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations.
  Many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research. Prominent
  scientific organizations include, the National Science Foundation in the U.S., the
  National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina, the academies of
  science of many nations, CSIRO in Australia, Centre national de la recherche scientifique
  in France, Max Planck Society and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft in Germany, and
  in Spain, CSIC.An enormous range of scientific literature is published.[46]Scientific
  journals communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities
  and various other research institutions, serving as an archival record of science.
  The first scientific journals, Journal des Sçavans followed by the Philosophical
  Transactions, began publication in 1665. Since that time the total number of active
  periodicals has steadily increased. In 1981, one estimate for the number of scientific
  and technical journals in publication was 11,500.[47] The United States National
  Library of Medicine currently indexes 5,516 journals that contain articles on topics
  related to the life sciences. Although the journals are in 39 languages, 91 percent
  of the indexed articles are published in English.[48]Most scientific journals cover
  a single scientific field and publish the research within that field; the research
  is normally expressed in the form of a scientific paper. Science has become so pervasive
  in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the
  achievements, news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace.Science magazines
  such as New Scientist, Science & Vie, and Scientific American cater to the needs
  of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas
  of research, including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research.
  Science books engage the interest of many more people. Tangentially, the science
  fiction genre, primarily fantastic in nature, engages the public imagination and
  transmits the ideas, if not the methods, of science.Recent efforts to intensify
  or develop links between science and non-scientific disciplines such as Literature
  or, more specifically, Poetry, include the Creative Writing Science resource developed
  through the Royal Literary Fund.[49]Science has traditionally been a male-dominated
  field, with some notable exceptions.[nb 14] Women historically faced considerable
  discrimination in science, much as they did in other areas of male-dominated societies,
  such as frequently being passed over for job opportunities and denied credit for
  their work.[nb 15] For example, Christine Ladd (1847–1930) was able to enter a Ph.D.
  program as 'C. Ladd'; Christine \"Kitty\" Ladd completed the requirements in 1882,
  but was awarded her degree only in 1926, after a career which spanned the algebra
  of logic (see truth table), color vision, and psychology. Her work preceded notable
  researchers like Ludwig Wittgenstein and Charles Sanders Peirce. The achievements
  of women in science have been attributed to their defiance of their traditional
  role as laborers within the domestic sphere.[50]In the late 20th century, active
  recruitment of women and elimination of institutional discrimination on the basis
  of sex greatly increased the number of female scientists, but large gender disparities
  remain in some fields; over half of new biologists are female, while 80% of PhDs
  in physics are given to men. Feminists claim this is the result of culture rather
  than an innate difference between the sexes, and some experiments have shown that
  parents challenge and explain more to boys than girls, asking them to reflect more
  deeply and logically.[51] In the early part of the 21st century, in America, women
  earned 50.3% bachelor's degrees, 45.6% master's degrees, and 40.7% of PhDs in science
  and engineering fields with women earning more than half of the degrees in three
  fields: Psychology (about 70%), Social Sciences (about 50%), and Biology (about
  50-60%). However, when it comes to the Physical Sciences, Geosciences, Math, Engineering,
  and Computer Science; women earned less than half the degrees.[52] However, lifestyle
  choice also plays a major role in female engagement in science; women with young
  children are 28% less likely to take tenure-track positions due to work-life balance
  issues,[53] and female graduate students' interest in careers in research declines
  dramatically over the course of graduate school, whereas that of their male colleagues
  remains unchanged.[54]Science policy is an area of public policy concerned with
  the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise, including research
  funding, often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological
  innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health
  care and environmental monitoring. Science policy also refers to the act of applying
  scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies. Science
  policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences.
  In accordance with public policy being concerned about the well-being of its citizens,
  science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the
  public.State policy has influenced the funding of public works and science for thousands
  of years, dating at least from the time of the Mohists, who inspired the study of
  logic during the period of the Hundred Schools of Thought, and the study of defensive
  fortifications during the Warring States period in China. In Great Britain, governmental
  approval of the Royal Society in the 17th century recognized a scientific community
  which exists to this day. The professionalization of science, begun in the 19th
  century, was partly enabled by the creation of scientific organizations such as
  the National Academy of Sciences, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, and State funding
  of universities of their respective nations. Public policy can directly affect the
  funding of capital equipment, intellectual infrastructure for industrial research,
  by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund research. Vannevar
  Bush, director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development for the United
  States government, the forerunner of the National Science Foundation, wrote in July
  1945 that \"Science is a proper concern of government\".[55]Science and technology
  research is often funded through a competitive process, in which potential research
  projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding. Such processes,
  which are run by government, corporations or foundations, allocate scarce funds.
  Total research funding in most developed countries is between 1.5% and 3% of GDP.[56]
  In the OECD, around two-thirds of research and development in scientific and technical
  fields is carried out by industry, and 20% and 10% respectively by universities
  and government. The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher,
  and it dominates research in social science and humanities. Similarly, with some
  exceptions (e.g. biotechnology) government provides the bulk of the funds for basic
  scientific research. In commercial research and development, all but the most research-oriented
  corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation possibilities rather
  than \"blue-sky\" ideas or technologies (such as nuclear fusion).The mass media
  face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing
  scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community
  as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific
  debate may require considerable expertise regarding the matter.[57] Few journalists
  have real scientific knowledge, and even beat reporters who know a great deal about
  certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific issues that they
  are suddenly asked to cover.[58][59]Many issues damage the relationship of science
  to the media and the use of science and scientific arguments by politicians. As
  a very broad generalisation, many politicians seek certainties and facts whilst
  scientists typically offer probabilities and caveats. However, politicians' ability
  to be heard in the mass media frequently distorts the scientific understanding by
  the public. Examples in Britain include the controversy over the MMR inoculation,
  and the 1988 forced resignation of a Government Minister, Edwina Currie for revealing
  the high probability that battery farmed eggs were contaminated with Salmonella.[60]John
  Horgan, Chris Mooney, and researchers from the US and Canada have described Scientific
  Certainty Argumentation Methods (SCAMs), where an organization or think tank makes
  it their only goal to cast doubt on supported science because it conflicts with
  political agendas.[61][62][63][64] Hank Campbell and microbiologist Alex Berezow
  have described \"feel-good fallacies\" used in politics, where politicians frame
  their positions in a way that makes people feel good about supporting certain policies
  even when scientific evidence shows there is no need to worry or there is no need
  for dramatic change on current programs.[65]Various activities are developed to
  approximate the general public and science/scientists, such as in science outreach,
  public awareness of science, science communication, science festivals, citizen science,
  science journalism, public science, popular science, etc.; see Science and the public
  for related concepts. Science is represented by the 'S' in STEM fields.Working scientists
  usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the
  scientific method: (1) that there is an objective reality shared by all rational
  observers; (2) that this objective reality is governed by natural laws; (3) that
  these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation.[8]
  Philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions
  mean and whether they are valid.The belief that scientific theories should and do
  represent metaphysical reality is known as realism. It can be contrasted with anti-realism,
  the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about
  unobservable entities such as electrons. One form of anti-realism is idealism, the
  belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence, and that each mind
  generates its own reality.[nb 16] In an idealistic world view, what is true for
  one mind need not be true for other minds.There are different schools of thought
  in philosophy of science. The most popular position is empiricism,[nb 17] which
  holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific
  theories are the result of generalizations from such observations.[66] Empiricism
  generally encompasses inductivism, a position that tries to explain the way general
  theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and
  hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories.
  This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite,
  which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using deductive
  logic only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being bayesianism[67]
  and the hypothetico-deductive method.[68]:p236Empiricism has stood in contrast to
  rationalism, the position originally associated with Descartes, which holds that
  knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation.[68]:p20Critical
  rationalism is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by
  Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper. Popper rejected the way that empiricism
  describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories
  are not generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of theories
  and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in
  conflict with it.[68]:pp63–7 Popper proposed replacing verifiability with falsifiability
  as the landmark of scientific theories, and replacing induction with falsification
  as the empirical method.[68]:p68 Popper further claimed that there is actually only
  one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism,
  trial and error.[69] It covers all products of the human mind, including science,
  mathematics, philosophy, and art.[70]Another approach, instrumentalism, colloquially
  termed \"shut up and calculate\", emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments
  for explaining and predicting phenomena.[71] It views scientific theories as black
  boxes with only their input (initial conditions) and output (predictions) being
  relevant. Consequences, theoretical entities and logical structure are claimed to
  be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn't make a
  fuss about (see interpretations of quantum mechanics). Close to instrumentalism
  is constructive empiricism, according to which the main criterion for the success
  of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true.Paul
  K Feyerabend advanced the idea of epistemological anarchism, which holds that there
  are no useful and exception-free methodological rules governing the progress of
  science or the growth of knowledge, and that the idea that science can or should
  operate according to universal and fixed rules is unrealistic, pernicious and detrimental
  to science itself.[72] Feyerabend advocates treating science as an ideology alongside
  others such as religion, magic and mythology, and considers the dominance of science
  in society authoritarian and unjustified. He also contended (along with Imre Lakatos)[discuss]
  that the demarcation problem of distinguishing science from pseudoscience on objective
  grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according
  to fixed, universal rules.[72] Feyerabend also stated that science does not have
  evidence for its philosophical precepts, particularly the notion of Uniformity of
  Law and the Uniformity of Process across time and space.[73]Finally, another approach
  often cited in debates of scientific skepticism against controversial movements
  like \"scientific creationism\", is methodological naturalism. Its main point is
  that a difference between natural and supernatural explanations should be made,
  and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations.[nb
  18] That the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means
  that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not
  claim them to be wrong either. Instead, supernatural explanations should be left
  a matter of personal belief outside the scope of science. Methodological naturalism
  maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to empirical study and independent
  verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for
  observable phenomena.[74] The absence of these standards, arguments from authority,
  biased observational studies and other common fallacies are frequently cited by
  supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non-science they
  criticize.A scientific theory is empirical,[nb 17][75] and is always open to falsification
  if new evidence is presented. That is, no theory is ever considered strictly certain
  as science accepts the concept of fallibilism.[nb 19] The philosopher of science
  Karl Popper sharply distinguishes truth from certainty. He writes that scientific
  knowledge \"consists in the search for truth\", but it \"is not the search for certainty ...
  All human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain.\"[76]:p4New scientific
  knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding. According to psychologist
  Keith Stanovich, it may be the media's overuse of words like \"breakthrough\" that
  leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought
  was true to be false.[77]:119–138 While there are such famous cases as the theory
  of relativity that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions.
  Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different
  experiments, by various researchers, across different branches of science; it is
  more like a climb than a leap.[77]:123 Theories vary in the extent to which they
  have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community.[nb
  20] For example, heliocentric theory, the theory of evolution, relativity theory,
  and germ theory still bear the name \"theory\" even though, in practice, they are
  considered factual.[78] Philosopher Barry Stroud adds that, although the best definition
  for \"knowledge\" is contested, being skeptical and entertaining the possibility
  that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct. Ironically then, the scientist
  adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess
  the truth.[79] The fallibilist C. S. Peirce argued that inquiry is the struggle
  to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome, verbal, or hyperbolic doubt
  is fruitless[80]—but also that the inquirer should try to attain genuine doubt rather
  than resting uncritically on common sense.[81] He held that the successful sciences
  trust, not to any single chain of inference (no stronger than its weakest link),
  but to the cable of multiple and various arguments intimately connected.[82]Stanovich
  also asserts that science avoids searching for a \"magic bullet\"; it avoids the
  single-cause fallacy. This means a scientist would not ask merely \"What is the
  cause of ...\", but rather \"What are the most significant causes of ...\". This
  is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science (e.g. psychology,
  cosmology).[77]:141–147 Of course, research often analyzes few factors at once,
  but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to
  consider.[77]:141–147 For example: knowing the details of only a person's genetics,
  or their history and upbringing, or the current situation may not explain a behaviour,
  but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive.An
  area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim
  a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes referred
  to as pseudoscience, fringe science, or junk science.[nb 21] Physicist Richard Feynman
  coined the term \"cargo cult science\" for cases in which researchers believe they
  are doing science because their activities have the outward appearance of science
  but actually lack the \"kind of utter honesty\" that allows their results to be
  rigorously evaluated.[83] Various types of commercial advertising, ranging from
  hype to fraud, may fall into these categories.There also can be[discuss] an element
  of political or ideological bias on all sides of scientific debates.[citation needed]
  Sometimes, research may be characterized as \"bad science\", research that may be
  well-intentioned but is actually incorrect, obsolete, incomplete, or over-simplified
  expositions of scientific ideas. The term \"scientific misconduct\" refers to situations
  such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data
  or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person.[84]Although
  encyclopedias such as Pliny (fl. 77 AD) Natural History offered purported fact,
  they proved unreliable. A skeptical point of view, demanding a method of proof,
  was the practical position taken to deal with unreliable knowledge. As early as
  1000 years ago, scholars such as Alhazen (Doubts Concerning Ptolemy), Roger Bacon,
  Witelo, John Pecham, Francis Bacon (1605), and C. S. Peirce (1839–1914) provided
  the community to address these points of uncertainty. In particular, fallacious
  reasoning can be exposed, such as 'affirming the consequent'.\"If a man will begin
  with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with
  doubts, he shall end in certainties.\" —Francis Bacon (1605) The Advancement of
  Learning, Book 1, v, 8The methods of inquiry into a problem have been known for
  thousands of years,[85] and extend beyond theory to practice. The use of measurements,
  for example, is a practical approach to settle disputes in the community.John Ziman
  points out that intersubjective pattern recognition is fundamental to the creation
  of all scientific knowledge.[86]:p44 Ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns
  to each other across centuries: Ziman refers to this ability as 'perceptual consensibility'.[87]:p46
  Ziman then makes consensibility, leading to consensus, the touchstone of reliable
  knowledge.[87]:p104Although some scientific research is applied research into specific
  problems, a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking
  of basic research. This leads to options for technological advance that were not
  planned or sometimes even imaginable. This point was made by Michael Faraday when,
  allegedly in response to the question \"what is the use of basic research?\" he
  responded \"Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?\".[88] For example, research
  into the effects of red light on the human eye's rod cells did not seem to have
  any practical purpose; eventually, the discovery that our night vision is not troubled
  by red light would lead search and rescue teams (among others) to adopt red light
  in the cockpits of jets and helicopters.[77]:106–110 In a nutshell: Basic research
  is the search for knowledge. Applied research is the search for solutions to practical
  problems using this knowledge. Finally, even basic research can take unexpected
  turns, and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to harness
  luck.Due to the increasing complexity of information and specialization of scientists,
  most of the cutting-edge research today is done by well funded groups of scientists,
  rather than individuals.[89] D.K. Simonton notes that due to the breadth of very
  precise and far reaching tools already used by researchers today and the amount
  of research generated so far, creation of new disciplines or revolutions within
  a discipline may no longer be possible as it is unlikely that some phenomenon that
  merits its own discipline has been overlooked. Hybridizing of disciplines and finessing
  knowledge is, in his view, the future of science.[89]Discoveries in fundamental
  science can be world-changing. For example:PublicationsResources"
