  ^ English is the de facto language of American government and the sole language spoken at home by 80 percent of Americans aged five and older. It is the official language of at least 28 states; some sources give higher figures, based on differing definitions of "official".[13] English and Hawaiian are both official languages in the state of Hawaii, and English and twenty Native American languages are official in Alaska. Cherokee is an official language in some Native-controlled lands of Oklahoma. French is a de facto but nonofficial language in the states of Maine and Louisiana, while New Mexico state law grants Spanish a special status.[14][15][16][17]

  ^ In five U.S. territories, English as well as one or more indigenous languages are official: Spanish in Puerto Rico, Samoan in American Samoa, Chamorro in both Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. Carolinian is also a official language in the Northern Mariana Islands.

  The United States of America (USA), commonly referred to as the United States (U.S.) or America, is a federal republic[19][20] composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major territories and various possessions.[fn 1][fn 2] The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. At 3.8 million square miles (9.842 million km2)[18] and with over 320 million people, the country is the world's third or fourth-largest by total area[fn 3] and the third most populous. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries.[26] The geography and climate of the United States are also extremely diverse, and the country is home to a wide variety of wildlife.[27]

  Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland at least 15,000 years ago,[28] with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast. Disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the United States by the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire.[29] The country's constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787, and ratified by the states in 1788. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.

  Driven by the doctrine of Manifest Destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century.[30] This involved displacing American Indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states, until by 1848 the nation spanned the continent.[30] During the second half of the 19th century, the American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country.[31][32] By the end of that century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean,[33] and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar.[34] The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.[35]

  The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy by nominal and real GDP, benefiting from an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity.[36] While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, the country continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers.[37] Accounting for 34% of global military spending[38] and 23% of world GDP,[39] it is the world's foremost military and economic power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovations.[40]

  In 1507, the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller produced a world map on which he named the lands of the Western Hemisphere "America" after the Italian explorer and cartographer Amerigo Vespucci (Latin: Americus Vespucius).[41] The first documentary evidence of the phrase "United States of America" is from a letter dated January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, Esq., George Washington's aide-de-camp and Muster-Master General of the Continental Army. Addressed to Lt. Col. Joseph Reed, Moylan expressed his wish to carry the "full and ample powers of the United States of America" to Spain to assist in the revolutionary war effort.[42]
- |
  The first known publication of the phrase "United States of America" was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia, on April 6, 1776.[43][44] In June 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote the phrase "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA" in all capitalized letters in the headline of his "original Rough draught" of the Declaration of Independence.[45][46] In the final Fourth of July version of the Declaration, the title was changed to read, "The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America".[47] In 1777 the Articles of Confederation announced, "The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America'".[48] The preamble of the Constitution states "...establish this Constitution for the United States of America."
- |
  The short form "United States" is also standard. Other common forms are the "U.S.", the "USA", and "America". Colloquial names are the "U.S. of A." and, internationally, the "States". "Columbia", a name popular in poetry and songs of the late 1700s, derives its origin from Christopher Columbus; it appears in the name "District of Columbia".[49] In non-English languages, the name is frequently the translation of either the "United States" or "United States of America", and colloquially as "America". In addition, an abbreviation (e.g. USA) is sometimes used.[50]
- |
  The phrase "United States" was originally plural, a description of a collection of independent states—e.g., "the United States are"—including in the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1865. The singular form—e.g., "the United States is"— became popular after the end of the American Civil War. The singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained in the idiom "these United States".[51] The difference is more significant than usage; it is a difference between a collection of states and a unit.[52]
- |
  A citizen of the United States is an "American". "United States", "American" and "U.S." refer to the country adjectivally ("American values", "U.S. forces"). "American" rarely refers to subjects not connected with the United States.[53]

  The first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival.[28] Some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture, developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level societies. After the Spanish conquistadors made the first contacts, the native population declined for various reasons, primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles. Violence was not a significant factor in the overall decline, though it impacted specific tribes and colonial settlements.[54][55][56][57][58][59] In the Hawaiian Islands the earliest indigenous inhabitants arrived around 1 AD from Polynesia. Captain James Cook arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in 1778[60] with American contact made in 1790 with the first ship to dock arriving in Oahu.[61]

  In the early days of colonization many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their colonial wars.[62] At the same time, however, many natives and settlers came to depend on each other. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other European wares.[63] Natives taught many settlers where, when and how to cultivate corn, beans and squash. European missionaries and others felt it was important to "civilize" the Indians and urged them to adopt European agricultural techniques and lifestyles.[64][65]

  After Columbus' first voyage to the New World in 1492, other explorers followed with settlement into the Floridas and the American Southwest.[66][67] There were also some French attempts to colonize the east coast, and later more successful settlements along the Mississippi River. Successful English settlement on the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and the Pilgrims' Plymouth Colony in 1620. Early experiments in communal living failed until the introduction of private farm holdings.[68] Many settlers were dissenting Christian groups who came seeking religious freedom. The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's House of Burgesses created in 1619, and the Mayflower Compact, signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking, established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[69][70]

  Most settlers in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements. Cash crops included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply.[71] Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive freed indentured servants pushed further west.[72]
- |
  Slave cultivation of cash crops began with the Spanish in the 1500s, and was adopted by the English, but life expectancy was much higher in North America because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid increase in the numbers of slaves.[73][74][75] Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice.[76][77] But by the turn of the 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.[78]
- |
  With the British colonization of Georgia in 1732, the 13 colonies that would become the United States of America were established.[79] All had local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to the ancient rights of Englishmen and a sense of self-government stimulating support for republicanism.[80] With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly. Relatively small Native American populations were eclipsed.[81] The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty.[82]
- |
  In the French and Indian War, British forces seized Canada from the French, but the francophone population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans, who were being conquered and displaced, those 13 colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[83] The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.[84]

  The American Revolutionary War was the first successful colonial war of independence against a European power. Americans had developed an ideology of "republicanism" asserting that government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures. They demanded their rights as Englishmen, "no taxation without representation". The British insisted on administering the empire through Parliament, and the conflict escalated into war.[85]
- |
  Following the passage of the Lee Resolution, on July 2, 1776, which was the actual vote for independence, the Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, on July 4, which proclaimed, in a long preamble, that humanity is created equal in their unalienable rights and that those rights were not being protected by Great Britain, and finally declared, in the words of the resolution, that the Thirteen Colonies were independent states and had no allegiance to the British crown in the United States. The fourth day of July is celebrated annually as Independence Day. In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a weak government that operated until 1789.[86]
- |
  Britain recognized the independence of the United States following their defeat at Yorktown.[87] In the peace treaty of 1783, American sovereignty was recognized from the Atlantic coast west to the Mississippi River. Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution, ratified in state conventions in 1788. The federal government was reorganized into three branches, on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances, in 1789. George Washington, who had led the revolutionary army to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.[88]
- |
  Although the federal government criminalized the international slave trade in 1808, after 1820 cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it the slave population.[89][90][91] The Second Great Awakening, beginning about 1800, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism;[92] in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations.[93]

  Americans' eagerness to expand westward prompted a long series of American Indian Wars.[94] The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nation's size.[95] The War of 1812, declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism.[96] A series of U.S. military incursions into Florida led Spain to cede it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[97] Expansion was aided by steam power, when steamboats began traveling along America's large water systems, which were connected by new canals, such as the Erie and the I&M; then, even faster railroads began their stretch across the nation's land.[98]

  From 1820 to 1850, Jacksonian democracy began a set of reforms which included wider male suffrage; it led to the rise of the Second Party System of Democrats and Whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854. The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that moved Indians into the west to their own reservations. The U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest destiny.[99] The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[100] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.[101]
- |
  The California Gold Rush of 1848–49 spurred western migration and the creation of additional western states.[102] After the American Civil War, new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers, expanded internal trade and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[103] Over a half-century, the loss of the American bison (sometimes called "buffalo") was an existential blow to many Plains Indians cultures.[104] In 1869, a new Peace Policy sought to protect Native-Americans from abuses, avoid further war, and secure their eventual U.S. citizenship, although conflicts, including several of the largest Indian Wars, continued throughout the West into the 1900s.[105]

  Differences of opinion and social order between northern and southern states in early United States society, particularly regarding Black slavery, ultimately led the U.S. into the American Civil War.[106] Initially, states entering the Union alternated between slave and free states, keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.[107]
- |
  With the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln, the first president from the largely anti-slavery Republican Party, conventions in thirteen states ultimately declared secession and formed the Confederate States of America, while the U.S. federal government maintained that secession was illegal.[107] The ensuing war was at first for Union, then after 1863 as casualties mounted and Lincoln delivered his Emancipation Proclamation, a second war aim became abolition of slavery. The war remains the deadliest military conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians.[108]
- |
  Following the Union victory in 1865, three amendments to the U.S. Constitution brought about the prohibition of slavery, gave U.S. citizenship to the nearly four million African Americans who had been slaves,[109] and promised them voting rights. The war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in federal power[110] aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the Southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed slaves.[111] Following the Reconstruction Era, throughout the South Jim Crow laws soon effectively disenfranchised most blacks and some poor whites. Over the subsequent decades, in both the North and the South blacks and some whites faced systemic discrimination, including racial segregation and occasional vigilante violence, sparking national movements against these abuses.[111]

  In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country's industrialization and transformed its culture.[112] National infrastructure including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the American Old West. The later invention of electric light and the telephone would also impact communication and urban life.[113]
- |
  The end of the Indian Wars further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation, increasing surpluses for international markets.[114] Mainland expansion was completed by the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.[115] In 1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii, which the U.S. annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same year, following the Spanish–American War.[116]
- |
  Rapid economic development at the end of the 19th century produced many prominent industrialists, and the U.S. economy became the world's largest.[117] Dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[118] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms in many societal areas, including women's suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer goods, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions.

  The United States remained neutral from the outbreak of World War I, in 1914, until 1917 when it joined the war as an "associated power", alongside the formal Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers. In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the Paris Peace Conference and advocated strongly for the U.S. to join the League of Nations. However, the Senate refused to approve this, and did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles that established the League of Nations.[119]
- |
  In 1920, the women's rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment granting women's suffrage.[120] The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early television.[121] The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression. After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal, which included the establishment of the Social Security system.[122] The Great Migration of millions of African Americans out of the American South began around WWI and extended through the 1960s;[123] whereas the Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.[124]
- |
  The United States was at first effectively neutral during World War II's early stages but began supplying material to the Allies in March 1941 through the Lend-Lease program. On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, prompting the United States to join the Allies against the Axis powers.[125] During the war, the United States was referred as one of the "Four Policemen"[126] of Allies power who met to plan the post-war world, along with Britain, the Soviet Union and China.[127][128] Though the nation lost more than 400,000 soldiers,[129] it emerged relatively undamaged from the war with even greater economic and military influence.[130]
- |
  Allied conferences at Bretton Woods and Yalta outlined a new system of international organizations that placed the United States and Soviet Union at the center of world affairs. As an Allied victory was won in Europe, a 1945 international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became active after the war.[131] The United States developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan; the Japanese surrendered on September 2, ending World War II.[132]

  After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed for power during what is known as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism[133] and, according to the school of geopolitics, a divide between the maritime Atlantic and the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.
- |
  The U.S. often opposed Third World movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored. American troops fought communist Chinese and North Korean forces in the Korean War of 1950–53.[134] The Soviet Union's 1957 launch of the first artificial satellite and its 1961 launch of the first manned spaceflight initiated a "Space Race" in which the United States became the first nation to land a man on the moon in 1969.[134] A proxy war in Southeast Asia eventually evolved into full American participation, as the Vietnam War.[fn 4]
- |
  At home, the U.S. experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid growth of its population and middle class. Construction of an Interstate Highway System transformed the nation's infrastructure over the following decades. Millions moved from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments.[141][142] In 1959 Hawaii became the 50th and last state added to the US.[143] A growing civil rights movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination, with Martin Luther King, Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead. A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, sought to end racial discrimination.[144][145][146] Meanwhile, a counterculture movement grew which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war, black nationalism, and the sexual revolution. The launch of a "War on Poverty" expanded entitlement and welfare spending.[147]
- |
  The 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation. After his election in 1980, President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation with free-market oriented reforms. Following the collapse of détente, he abandoned "containment" and initiated the more aggressive "rollback" strategy towards the USSR.[148][149][150][151][152] After a surge in female labor participation over the previous decade, by 1985 the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[153]
- |
  The late 1980s brought a "thaw" in relations with the USSR, and its collapse in 1991 finally ended the Cold War.[154][155][156][157] This brought about unipolarity[158] with the U.S. unchallenged as the world's dominant superpower. The concept of Pax Americana, which had appeared in the post-World War II period, gained wide popularity as a term for the post-Cold War new world order.

  After the Cold War, the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history, ending in 2001.[159]Originating in U.S. defense networks, the Internet spread to international academic networks, and then to the public in the 1990s, greatly impacting the global economy, society, and culture.[160] On September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda terrorists struck the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people.[161] In response, the United States launched the War on Terror, which includes the ongoing war in Afghanistan and the 2003–11 Iraq War.[162][163]

  Beginning in 1994, the U.S. entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), linking 450 million people producing $17 trillion worth of goods and services. The goal of the agreement was to eliminate trade and investment barriers among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico by January 1, 2008; trade among the partners has soared since the agreement went into force.[164]

  The land area of the contiguous United States is 2,959,064 square miles (7.7 Mm2). Alaska, separated from the contiguous United States by Canada, is the largest state at 663,268 square miles (1.7 Mm2). Hawaii, occupying an archipelago in the central Pacific, southwest of North America, is 10,931 square miles (28,311 km2) in area. The populated territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and US Virgin Islands together cover 9,185 square miles (23,789 km2)[169]

  The United States is the world's third or fourth largest nation by total area (land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and just above or below China. The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted and how the total size of the United States is measured: calculations range from 3,676,486 square miles (9.5 Mm2)[170] to 3,717,813 square miles (9.6 Mm2)[171] to 3,794,101 square miles (9.8 Mm2)[5] to 3,805,927 square miles (9.9 Mm2).[18] Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada.[172]

  The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to deciduous forests and the rolling hills of the Piedmont.[173] The Appalachian Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[174] The Mississippi–Missouri River, the world's fourth longest river system, runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[174]

  The Rocky Mountains, at the western edge of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado.[175] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and deserts such as the Chihuahua and Mojave.[176] The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast, both ranges reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m). The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California,[177] and only about 84 miles (135 km) apart.[178] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali (Mount McKinley) is the highest peak in the country and North America.[179] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.[180]

  The United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[181] The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western mountains have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as are the populated territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[182] Extreme weather is not uncommon—the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur within the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South.[183]

  The U.S. ecology is megadiverse: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[184] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 bird species, 311 reptile species, and 295 amphibian species.[185] About 91,000 insect species have been described.[186] The bald eagle is both the national bird and national animal of the United States, and is an enduring symbol of the country itself.[187]

  There are 58 national parks and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas.[188] Altogether, the government owns about 28% of the country's land area.[189] Most of this is protected, though some is leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching; about .86% is used for military purposes.[190][191]

  Environmental issues have been on the national agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation,[192][193] and international responses to global warming.[194][195] Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970.[196] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[197] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.[198]

  The U.S. Census Bureau currently estimates the country's population to be 322,431,000.[200] The U.S. population almost quadrupled during the 20th century, from about 76 million in 1900.[201] The third most populous nation in the world, after China and India, the United States is the only major industrialized nation in which large population increases are projected.[202] In the 1800s the average woman had 7.04 children, by the 1900s this number had decreased to 3.56.[203] Since the early 1970s the birth rate has been below the replacement rate of 2.1 with 1.86 children per woman in 2014. Foreign born immigration has caused the US population to continue its rapid increase with the foreign born population doubling from almost 20 million in 1990 to over 40 million in 2010, representing one third of the population increase.[204] The foreign born population reached 45 million in 2015.[205]

  The United States has a very diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members.[206]German Americans are the largest ethnic group (more than 50 million) – followed by Irish Americans (circa 37 million), Mexican Americans (circa 31 million) and English Americans (circa 28 million).[207][208]
- |
  White Americans are the largest racial group; Black Americans are the nation's largest racial minority (note that in the U.S. Census, Hispanic and Latino Americans are counted as an ethnic group, not a racial group), and third largest ancestry group.[206]Asian Americans are the country's second largest racial minority; the three largest Asian American ethnic groups are Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, and Indian Americans.[206]
- |
  The United States has a birth rate of 13 per 1,000, which is 5 births below the world average.[209] Its population growth rate is positive at 0.7%, higher than that of many developed nations.[210] In fiscal year 2012, over one million immigrants (most of whom entered through family reunification) were granted legal residence.[211]Mexico has been the leading source of new residents since the 1965 Immigration Act. China, India, and the Philippines have been in the top four sending countries every year since the 1990s.[212] As of 2012[update], approximately 11.4 million residents are illegal immigrants.[213] As of 2015, 47% of all immigrants are Hispanic, 26% are Asian, 18% are white and 8% are black. The percentage of immigrants who are Asian is increasing while the percentage who are Hispanic is decreasing.[205]

  According to a survey conducted by the Williams Institute, nine million Americans, or roughly 3.4% of the adult population identify themselves as homosexual, bisexual, or transgender.[214][215] A 2012 Gallup poll also concluded that 3.5% of adult Americans identified as LGBT. The highest percentage came from the District of Columbia (10%), while the lowest state was North Dakota at 1.7%.[216] In a 2013 survey, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 96.6% of Americans identify as straight, while 1.6% identify as gay or lesbian, and 0.7% identify as being bisexual.[217]
- |
  In 2010, the U.S. population included an estimated 5.2 million people with some American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry (2.9 million exclusively of such ancestry) and 1.2 million with some native Hawaiian or Pacific island ancestry (0.5 million exclusively).[218] The census counted more than 19 million people of "Some Other Race" who were "unable to identify with any" of its five official race categories in 2010.[218]
- |
  The population growth of Hispanic and Latino Americans (the terms are officially interchangeable) is a major demographic trend. The 50.5 million Americans of Hispanic descent[218] are identified as sharing a distinct "ethnicity" by the Census Bureau; 64% of Hispanic Americans are of Mexican descent.[219] Between 2000 and 2010, the country's Hispanic population increased 43% while the non-Hispanic population rose just 4.9%.[220] Much of this growth is from immigration; in 2007, 12.6% of the U.S. population was foreign-born, with 54% of that figure born in Latin America.[221]
- |
  Fertility is also a factor; in 2010 the average Hispanic woman gave birth to 2.35 children in her lifetime, compared to 1.97 for non-Hispanic black women and 1.79 for non-Hispanic white women (both below the replacement rate of 2.1).[222]Minorities (as defined by the Census Bureau as all those beside non-Hispanic, non-multiracial whites) constituted 36.3% of the population in 2010 (this is nearly 40% in 2015),[223] and over 50% of children under age one,[224] and are projected to constitute the majority by 2042.[225] This contradicts the report by the National Vital Statistics Reports, based on the U.S. census data, which concludes that 54% (2,162,406 out of 3,999,386 in 2010) of births were non-Hispanic white.[222] The Hispanic birth rate plummeted 25% between 2006 and 2013 while the rate for non-Hispanics decreased just 5%.[226]

  About 82% of Americans live in urban areas (including suburbs);[5] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[227] The US has numerous clusters of cities known as megaregions, the largest being the Great Lakes Megalopolis followed by the Northeast Megalopolis and Southern California. In 2008, 273 incorporated places had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four global cities had over two million (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston).[228] There are 52 metropolitan areas with populations greater than one million.[229] Of the 50 fastest-growing metro areas, 47 are in the West or South.[230] The metro areas of San Bernardino, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and Phoenix all grew by more than a million people between 2000 and 2008.[229]

  English (American English) is the de facto national language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2010, about 230 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language.[232][233] Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in 28 states.[13]
- |
  Both Hawaiian and English are official languages in Hawaii, by state law.[234] Alaska recognizes twenty Native languages.[235] While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French.[236] Other states, such as California, mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents including court forms.[237] Many jurisdictions with large numbers of non-English speakers produce government materials, especially voting information, in the most commonly spoken languages in those jurisdictions.
- |
  Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan[238] and Chamorro[239] are recognized by American Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands;[240]Cherokee is officially recognized by the Cherokee Nation within the Cherokee tribal jurisdiction area in eastern Oklahoma;[241] Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico and is more widely spoken than English there.[242]
- |
  According to the Center for Immigration Studies, Arabic and Urdu (Pakistan's national language) are the fastest growing foreign languages spoken at American households. According to the survey, more than 63.2 million US residents speak a language other than English at home. In recent years, Arabic speaking residents increased by 29%, Urdu by 23% and Persian by 9%.[243]
- |
  The most widely taught foreign languages at all levels in the United States (in terms of enrollment numbers) are: Spanish (around 7.2 million students), French (1.5 million), and German (500,000). Other commonly taught languages (with 100,000 to 250,000 learners) include Latin, Japanese, American Sign Language, Italian, and Chinese.[244][245] 18% of all Americans claim to speak at least one language in addition to English.[246]

  The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment. Christianity is by far the most common religion practiced in the U.S., but other religions are followed, too. In a 2013 survey, 56% of Americans said that religion played a "very important role in their lives", a far higher figure than that of any other wealthy nation.[248] In a 2009 Gallup poll 42% of Americans said that they attended church weekly or almost weekly; the figures ranged from a low of 23% in Vermont to a high of 63% in Mississippi.[249]
- |
  As with other Western countries, the U.S. is becoming less religious. Irreligion is growing rapidly among Americans under 30.[250] Polls show that overall American confidence in organized religion is declining,[251] and that younger Americans in particular are becoming increasingly irreligious.[247][252] According to a 2012 study, Protestant share of U.S. population dropped to 48%, thus ending its status as religious category of the majority for the first time.[253][254][255] Americans with no religion have 1.7 children compared to 2.2 among Christians. The unaffiliated are less likely to get married with 37% marrying compared to 52% of Christians.[256]
- |
  According to a 2014 survey, 70.6% of adults identified themselves as Christian,[257]Protestant denominations accounted for 46.5%, while Roman Catholicism, at 20.8%, was the largest individual denomination.[258] The total reporting non-Christian religions in 2014 was 5.9%.[258] Other religions include Judaism (1.9%), Islam (0.9%), Buddhism (0.7%), Hinduism (0.7%).[258] The survey also reported that 22.8% of Americans described themselves as agnostic, atheist or simply having no religion, up from 8.2% in 1990.[258][259][260] There are also Unitarian Universalist, Baha'i, Sikh, Jain, Shinto, Confucian, Taoist, Druid, Native American, Wiccan, humanist and deist communities.[261]

  Protestantism is the largest Christian religious grouping in the United States. Baptists collectively form the largest branch of Protestantism, and the Southern Baptist Convention is the largest individual Protestant denomination. About 26% of Americans identify as Evangelical Protestants, while 15% are Mainline and 7% belong to a traditionally Black church. Roman Catholicism in the United States has its origin in the Spanish and French colonization of the Americas, and later grew because of Irish, Italian, Polish, German and Hispanic immigration. Rhode Island is the only state where a majority of the population is Catholic. Lutheranism in the U.S. has its origin in immigration from Northern Europe and Germany. North and South Dakota are the only states in which a plurality of the population is Lutheran. Presbyterianism was introduced in North America by Scottish and Ulster Scots immigrants. Although it has spread across the United States, it is heavily concentrated on the East Coast. Dutch Reformed congregations were founded first in New Amsterdam (New York City) before spreading westward. Utah is the only state where Mormonism is the religion of the majority of the population. The Mormon Corridor also extends to parts of Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming.[262]
- |
  The Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the Southern United States in which socially conservative Evangelical Protestantism is a significant part of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation's average. By contrast, religion plays the least important role in New England and in the Western United States.[249]

  The U.S. teenage pregnancy rate is 26.5 per 1,000 women. The rate has declined by 57% since 1991.[265] In 2013, the highest teenage birth rate was in Alabama, and the lowest in Wyoming.[265][266]Abortion is legal throughout the U.S., owing to Roe v. Wade, a 1973 landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. While the abortion rate is falling, the abortion ratio of 241 per 1,000 live births and abortion rate of 15 per 1,000 women aged 15–44 remain higher than those of most Western nations.[267] In 2013, the average age at first birth was 26 and 40.6% of births were to unmarried women.[268]
- |
  The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated for 2013 at 1.86 births per woman.[269]Adoption in the United States is common and relatively easy from a legal point of view (compared to other Western countries).[270] In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the U.S. accounted for nearly half of the total number of adoptions worldwide.[271] It is legal for same-sex couples to adopt. Polygamy is illegal throughout the U.S.[272]

  The United States is the world's oldest surviving federation. It is a constitutional republic and representative democracy, "in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law".[273] The government is regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal document.[274] For 2014, the U.S. ranked 19th on the Democracy Index[275] and 17th on the Corruption Perceptions Index.[276]

  In the American federalist system, citizens are usually subject to three levels of government: federal, state, and local. The local government's duties are commonly split between county and municipal governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of citizens by district. There is no proportional representation at the federal level, and it is rare at lower levels.[277]

  The federal government is composed of three branches:
- |
  Legislative: The bicameral Congress, made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse,[278] and has the power of impeachment, by which it can remove sitting members of the government.[279]
- |
  Executive: The President is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law (subject to Congressional override), and appoints the members of the Cabinet (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.[280]
- |
  Judicial: The Supreme Court and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the President with Senate approval, interpret laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional.[281]
- |
  The House of Representatives has 435 voting members, each representing a congressional district for a two-year term. House seats are apportioned among the states by population every tenth year. At the 2010 census, seven states had the minimum of one representative, while California, the most populous state, had 53.[282]
- |
  The Senate has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected at-large to six-year terms; one third of Senate seats are up for election every other year. The President serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice. The President is not elected by direct vote, but by an indirect electoral college system in which the determining votes are apportioned to the states and the District of Columbia.[283] The Supreme Court, led by the Chief Justice of the United States, has nine members, who serve for life.[284]
- |
  The state governments are structured in roughly similar fashion; Nebraska uniquely has a unicameral legislature.[285] The governor (chief executive) of each state is directly elected. Some state judges and cabinet officers are appointed by the governors of the respective states, while others are elected by popular vote.

  The original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states. Article One protects the right to the "great writ" of habeas corpus. The Constitution has been amended 27 times;[286] the first ten amendments, which make up the Bill of Rights, and the Fourteenth Amendment form the central basis of Americans' individual rights. All laws and governmental procedures are subject to judicial review and any law ruled by the courts to be in violation of the Constitution is voided. The principle of judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was established by the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison (1803)[287] in a decision handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall.[288]

  The United States is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and eleven uninhabited island possessions.[290] The states and territories are the principal administrative districts in the country. These are divided into subdivisions of counties and independent cities. The District of Columbia is a federal district which contains the capital of the United States, Washington DC.[291] The states and the District of Columbia choose the President of the United States. Each state has presidential electors equal to the number of their Representatives and Senators in Congress, the District of Columbia has three.[292]

  Congressional Districts are reapportioned among the states following each decennial Census of Population. Each state then draws single member districts to conform with the census apportionment. The total number of Representatives is 435, and delegate Members of Congress represent the District of Columbia and the five major US territories.[293]

  The United States also observes tribal sovereignty of the Native American nations. Though reservations are within state borders, the reservation is a sovereign entity. While the United States recognizes this sovereignty, other countries may not.[294]

  The United States has operated under a two-party system for most of its history.[295] For elective offices at most levels, state-administered primary elections choose the major party nominees for subsequent general elections. Since the general election of 1856, the major parties have been the Democratic Party, founded in 1824, and the Republican Party, founded in 1854. Since the Civil War, only one third-party presidential candidate—former president Theodore Roosevelt, running as a Progressive in 1912—has won as much as 20% of the popular vote. The third-largest political party is the Libertarian Party. The President and Vice-president are elected through the Electoral College system.[296]
- |
  Within American political culture, the Republican Party is considered "conservative" and the Democratic Party is considered "liberal".[297][disputed – discuss] The states of the Northeast and West Coast and some of the Great Lakes states, known as "blue states", are relatively liberal. The "red states" of the South and parts of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains are relatively conservative.

  The winner of the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, Democrat Barack Obama, is the 44th, and current, U.S. president. Current leadership in the Senate includes Democratic Vice President Joseph Biden, Republican President Pro Tempore (Pro Tem) Orrin Hatch, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Minority Leader Harry Reid.[298] Leadership in the House includes Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.[299]

  In the 114th United States Congress, both the House of Representatives and the Senate are controlled by the Republican Party. The Senate currently consists of 54 Republicans, and 44 Democrats with two independents who caucus with the Democrats; the House consists of 246 Republicans and 188 Democrats, with one vacancy.[300] In state governorships, there are 31 Republicans, 18 Democrats and one independent.[301] Among the DC mayor and the 5 territorial governors, there are 2 Republicans, 2 Democrats (one is also in the PPD), and 2 Independents.[302]

  The United States has an established structure of foreign relations. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and New York City is home to the United Nations Headquarters. It is a member of the G7,[303]G20, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Almost all countries have embassies in Washington, D.C., and many have consulates around the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host American diplomatic missions. However, Iran, North Korea, Bhutan, and the Republic of China (Taiwan) do not have formal diplomatic relations with the United States (although the U.S. still maintains relations with Taiwan and supplies it with military equipment).[304]

  The United States has a "special relationship" with the United Kingdom[305] and strong ties with Canada,[306]Australia,[307]New Zealand,[308]the Philippines,[309]Japan,[310]South Korea,[311]Israel,[312] and several European Union countries, including France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. It works closely with fellow NATO members on military and security issues and with its neighbors through the Organization of American States and free trade agreements such as the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. In 2008, the United States spent a net $25.4 billion on official development assistance, the most in the world. As a share of America's large gross national income (GNI), however, the U.S. contribution of 0.18% ranked last among 22 donor states. By contrast, private overseas giving by Americans is relatively generous.[313]

  Taxes are levied in the United States at the federal, state and local government level. These include taxes on income, payroll, property, sales, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. In 2010 taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of GDP.[315] During FY2012, the federal government collected approximately $2.45 trillion in tax revenue, up $147 billion or 6% versus FY2011 revenues of $2.30 trillion. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,132B or 47%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($845B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($242B or 10%).[316] Based on CBO Estimates,[317] under 2013 tax law the top 1% will be paying the highest average tax rates since 1979, while other income groups will remain at historic lows.[318]
- |
  U.S. taxation is generally progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and is among the most progressive in the developed world.[319][320][321][322][323] The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes,[324] and about half of all taxes.[325] Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains.[326][327] The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers.[328][329] However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.[330]
- |
  The top 10% paid 51.8% of total federal taxes in 2009, and the top 1%, with 13.4% of pre-tax national income, paid 22.3% of federal taxes.[331] In 2013 the Tax Policy Center projected total federal effective tax rates of 35.5% for the top 1%, 27.2% for the top quintile, 13.8% for the middle quintile, and −2.7% for the bottom quintile.[332][333] The incidence of corporate income tax has been a matter of considerable ongoing controversy for decades.[322][334] State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams, though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.[322][335]
- |
  During FY 2012, the federal government spent $3.54 trillion on a budget or cash basis, down $60 billion or 1.7% vs. FY 2011 spending of $3.60 trillion. Major categories of FY 2012 spending included: Medicare & Medicaid ($802B or 23% of spending), Social Security ($768B or 22%), Defense Department ($670B or 19%), non-defense discretionary ($615B or 17%), other mandatory ($461B or 13%) and interest ($223B or 6%).[316]

  The total national debt in the United States was $18.527 trillion (106% of the GDP), according to an estimate for 2014 by the International Monetary Fund.[336] In January 2015, U.S. federal government debt held by the public was approximately $13 trillion, or about 72% of U.S. GDP. Intra-governmental holdings stood at $5 trillion, giving a combined total debt of $18.080 trillion.[337][338] By 2012, total federal debt had surpassed 100% of U.S. GDP.[339] The U.S. has a credit rating of AA+ from Standard & Poor's, AAA from Fitch, and AAA from Moody's.[340]
- |
  Historically, the U.S. public debt as a share of GDP increased during wars and recessions, and subsequently declined. For example, debt held by the public as a share of GDP peaked just after World War II (113% of GDP in 1945), but then fell over the following 30 years. In recent decades, large budget deficits and the resulting increases in debt have led to concern about the long-term sustainability of the federal government's fiscal policies.[341] However, these concerns are not universally shared.[342]

  The President holds the title of commander-in-chief of the nation's armed forces and appoints its leaders, the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The United States Department of Defense administers the armed forces, including the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. The Coast Guard is run by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and by the Department of the Navy during times of war. In 2008, the armed forces had 1.4 million personnel on active duty. The Reserves and National Guard brought the total number of troops to 2.3 million. The Department of Defense also employed about 700,000 civilians, not including contractors.[343]
- |
  Military service is voluntary, though conscription may occur in wartime through the Selective Service System.[344] American forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Force's large fleet of transport aircraft, the Navy's 10 active aircraft carriers, and Marine expeditionary units at sea with the Navy's Atlantic and Pacific fleets. The military operates 865 bases and facilities abroad,[345] and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.[346]

  The military budget of the United States in 2011 was more than $700 billion, 41% of global military spending and equal to the next 14 largest national military expenditures combined. At 4.7% of GDP, the rate was the second-highest among the top 15 military spenders, after Saudi Arabia.[347] U.S. defense spending as a percentage of GDP ranked 23rd globally in 2012 according to the CIA.[348] Defense's share of U.S. spending has generally declined in recent decades, from Cold War peaks of 14.2% of GDP in 1953 and 69.5% of federal outlays in 1954 to 4.7% of GDP and 18.8% of federal outlays in 2011.[349]

  The proposed base Department of Defense budget for 2012, $553 billion, was a 4.2% increase over 2011; an additional $118 billion was proposed for the military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.[350] The last American troops serving in Iraq departed in December 2011;[351] 4,484 service members were killed during the Iraq War.[352] Approximately 90,000 U.S. troops were serving in Afghanistan in April 2012;[353] by November 8, 2013 2,285 had been killed during the War in Afghanistan.[354]

  Law enforcement in the United States is primarily the responsibility of local police and sheriff's departments, with state police providing broader services. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is the largest in the country. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, including protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws.[356] At the federal level and in almost every state, a legal system operates on a common law. State courts conduct most criminal trials; federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. Plea bargaining in the United States is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled by plea bargain rather than jury trial.[357]

  In 2012 there were 4.7 murders per 100,000 persons in the United States, a 54% decline from the modern peak of 10.2 in 1980.[358] In 2001–2, the United States had above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence compared to other developed nations.[359] A cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2003 showed that United States "homicide rates were 6.9 times higher than rates in the other high-income countries, driven by firearm homicide rates that were 19.5 times higher."[360][dated info]Gun ownership rights continue to be the subject of contentious political debate.

  From 1980 through 2008 males represented 77% of homicide victims and 90% of offenders. Blacks committed 52.5% of all homicides during that span, at a rate almost eight times that of whites ("whites" includes most Hispanics), and were victimized at a rate six times that of whites. Most homicides were intraracial, with 93% of black victims killed by blacks and 84% of white victims killed by whites.[361] In 2012, Louisiana had the highest rate of murder and non-negligent manslaughter in the U.S., and New Hampshire the lowest.[362] The FBI's Uniform Crime Reports estimates that there were 3,246 violent and property crimes per 100,000 residents in 2012, for a total of over 9 million total crimes.[363]
- |
  Capital punishment is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and used in 31 states.[364][365] No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in part to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In 1976, that Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma.[366] Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or struck down death penalty laws. In 2014, the country had the fifth highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq.[367]

  The United States has the highest documented incarceration rate and total prison population in the world.[368] At the start of 2008, more than 2.3 million people were incarcerated, more than one in every 100 adults.[369] At year end 2012, the combined U.S. adult correctional systems supervised about 6,937,600 offenders. About 1 in every 35 adult residents in the United States was under some form of correctional supervision at yearend 2012, the lowest rate observed since 1997.[370] The prison population has quadrupled since 1980.[371] However, the imprisonment rate for all prisoners sentenced to more than a year in state or federal facilities is 478 per 100,000 in 2013[372] and the rate for pre-trial/remand prisoners is 153 per 100,000 residents in 2012.[373] The country's high rate of incarceration is largely due to changes in sentencing guidelines and drug policies.[374] According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the majority of inmates held in federal prisons are convicted of drug offenses.[375] The privatization of prisons and prison services which began in the 1980s has been a subject of debate.[376][377] In 2008, Louisiana had the highest incarceration rate,[378] and Maine the lowest.[379]

  The United States is the largest importer of goods and second largest exporter, though exports per capita are relatively low. In 2010, the total U.S. trade deficit was $635 billion.[393] Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, and Germany are its top trading partners.[394] In 2010, oil was the largest import commodity, while transportation equipment was the country's largest export.[393] Japan is the largest foreign holder of U.S. public debt.[395] The largest holder of the U.S. debt are American entities, including federal government accounts and the Federal Reserve, who hold the majority of the debt.[396][397][398][399]

  The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI, found that the United States' arms industry was the world's biggest exporter of major weapons from 2005–2009,[400] and remained the largest exporter of major weapons during a period between 2010–2014, followed by Russia, China (PRC), and Germany.[401]

  In 2009, the private sector was estimated to constitute 86.4% of the economy, with federal government activity accounting for 4.3% and state and local government activity (including federal transfers) the remaining 9.3%.[402] The number of employees at all levels of government outnumber those in manufacturing by 1.7 to 1.[403] While its economy has reached a postindustrial level of development and its service sector constitutes 67.8% of GDP, the United States remains an industrial power.[404] The leading business field by gross business receipts is wholesale and retail trade; by net income it is manufacturing.[405] In the franchising business model, McDonald's and Subway are the two most recognized brands in the world. Coca-Cola is the most recognized soft drink company in the world.[406]
- |
  Chemical products are the leading manufacturing field.[407] The United States is the largest producer of oil in the world, as well as its second largest importer.[408] It is the world's number one producer of electrical and nuclear energy, as well as liquid natural gas, sulfur, phosphates, and salt. The National Mining Association provides data pertaining to coal and minerals that include beryllium, copper, lead, magnesium, zinc, titanium and others.[409][410]
- |
  Agriculture accounts for just under 1% of GDP,[404] yet the United States is the world's top producer of corn[411] and soybeans.[412] The National Agricultural Statistics Service maintains agricultural statistics for products that include peanuts, oats, rye, wheat, rice, cotton, corn, barley, hay, sunflowers, and oilseeds. In addition, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides livestock statistics regarding beef, poultry, pork, and dairy products. The country is the primary developer and grower of genetically modified food, representing half of the world's biotech crops.[413]

  Consumer spending comprises 68% of the U.S. economy in 2015.[414] In August 2010, the American labor force consisted of 154.1 million people. With 21.2 million people, government is the leading field of employment. The largest private employment sector is health care and social assistance, with 16.4 million people. About 12% of workers are unionized, compared to 30% in Western Europe.[415] The World Bank ranks the United States first in the ease of hiring and firing workers.[416] The United States is ranked among the top three in the Global Competitiveness Report as well. It has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than European nations tend to.[417]

  The United States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation[418] and is one of just a few countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia.[419] However, 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers get the same benefits.[420] While federal law currently does not require sick leave, it's a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations.[420] In 2009, the United States had the third highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. It was fourth in productivity per hour, behind those two countries and the Netherlands.[421]

  The 2008–2012 global recession had a significant impact on the United States, with output still below potential according to the Congressional Budget Office.[422] It brought high unemployment (which has been decreasing but remains above pre-recession levels), along with low consumer confidence, the continuing decline in home values and increase in foreclosures and personal bankruptcies, an escalating federal debt crisis, inflation, and rising petroleum and food prices. There remains a record proportion of long-term unemployed, continued decreasing household income, and tax and federal budget increases.[423][424][425]

  Americans have the highest average household and employee income among OECD nations, and in 2007 had the second highest median household income.[426][427] According to the Census Bureau real median household income was $50,502 in 2011, down from $51,144 in 2010.[428] The Global Food Security Index ranked the U.S. number one for food affordability and overall food security in March 2013.[429] Americans on average have over twice as much living space per dwelling and per person as European Union residents, and more than every EU nation.[430] For 2013 the United Nations Development Programme ranked the United States 5th among 187 countries in its Human Development Index and 28th in its inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI).[431]

  There has been a widening gap between productivity and median incomes since the 1970s.[432] However, the gap between total compensation and productivity is not as wide because of increased employee benefits such as health insurance.[433] While inflation-adjusted ("real") household income had been increasing almost every year from 1947 to 1999, it has since been flat on balance and has even decreased recently.[434] According to Congressional Research Service, during this same period, immigration to the United States increased, while the lower 90% of tax filers incomes became stagnant, and eventually decreasing since 2000.[435] The rise in the share of total annual income received by the top 1 percent, which has more than doubled from 9 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011, has had a significant impact on income inequality,[436] leaving the United States with one of the widest income distributions among OECD nations.[437] The post-recession income gains have been very uneven, with the top 1 percent capturing 95 percent of the income gains from 2009 to 2012.[438] The extent and relevance of income inequality is a matter of debate.[439][disputed – discuss][440]

  Wealth, like income and taxes, is highly concentrated; the richest 10% of the adult population possess 72% of the country's household wealth, while the bottom half claim only 2%.[441] Between June 2007 and November 2008 the global recession led to falling asset prices around the world. Assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value.[442] Since peaking in the second quarter of 2007, household wealth was down $14 trillion, but has since increased $14 trillion over 2006 levels.[443][444] At the end of 2014, household debt amounted to $11.8 trillion,[445] down from $13.8 trillion at the end of 2008.[446]

  There were about 578,424 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in the U.S. in January 2014, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program.[447] In 2011 16.7 million children lived in food-insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 1.1% of U.S. children, or 845,000, saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns at some point during the year, and most cases were not chronic.[448] According to a 2014 report by the Census Bureau, one in five young adults lives in poverty today, up from one in seven in 1980.[449]

  American public education is operated by state and local governments, regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of six or seven (generally, kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[450]
- |
  About 12% of children are enrolled in parochial or nonsectarian private schools. Just over 2% of children are homeschooled.[451] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world, spending more than $11,000 per elementary student in 2010 and more than $12,000 per high school student.[452] Some 80% of U.S. college students attend public universities.[453]
- |
  The United States has many competitive private and public institutions of higher education. The majority of world's top universities listed by different ranking organizations are in the US.[454][455][456] There are also local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition. Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[457] The basic literacy rate is approximately 99%.[5][458] The United Nations assigns the United States an Education Index of 0.97, tying it for 12th in the world.[459]
- |
  As for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. trails some other OECD nations but spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[452][460] As of 2012[update], student loan debt exceeded one trillion dollars, more than Americans owe on credit cards.[461]

  The United States is home to many cultures and a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values.[26][462] Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five centuries.[463] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[26][464] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.[26]

  Core American culture was established by Protestant British colonists and shaped by the frontier settlement process, with the traits derived passed down to descendants and transmitted to immigrants through assimilation. Americans have traditionally been characterized by a strong work ethic, competitiveness, and individualism, as well as a unifying belief in an "American creed" emphasizing liberty, equality, private property, democracy, rule of law, and a preference for limited government.[465] Americans are extremely charitable by global standards. According to a 2006 British study, Americans gave 1.67% of GDP to charity, more than any other nation studied, more than twice the second place British figure of 0.73%, and around twelve times the French figure of 0.14%.[466][467]

  The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[468] Whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate.[469][470][471][472][391][473] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[474] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[475] Americans' self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree.[476] While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.[477]

  Mainstream American cuisine is similar to that in other Western countries. Wheat is the primary cereal grain with about three-quarters of grain products made of wheat flour[478] and many dishes use indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup which were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers.[479] These home grown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays; Thanksgiving, when some Americans make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion.[480]

  Characteristic dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants. French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed.[482] Americans drink three times as much coffee as tea.[483] Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages.[484][485]
- |
  American eating habits owe a great deal to that of their British culinary roots with some variations. Although American lands could grow newer vegetables England could not, most colonists would not eat these new foods until accepted by Europeans.[486] Over time American foods changed to a point that food critic, John L. Hess stated in 1972: "Our founding fathers were as far superior to our present political leaders in the quality of their food as they were in the quality of their prose and intelligence".[487]

  The American fast food industry, the world's largest,[488] pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s.[489] Fast food consumption has sparked health concerns. During the 1980s and 1990s, Americans' caloric intake rose 24%;[482] frequent dining at fast food outlets is associated with what public health officials call the American "obesity epidemic".[490] Highly sweetened soft drinks are widely popular, and sugared beverages account for nine percent of American caloric intake.[491]

  In the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American poet.[492] A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character—such as Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851), Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925) and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird (1960)— may be dubbed the "Great American Novel".[493]

  Eleven U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Toni Morrison in 1993. William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck are often named among the most influential writers of the 20th century.[494] Popular literary genres such as the Western and hardboiled crime fiction developed in the United States. The Beat Generation writers opened up new literary approaches, as have postmodernist authors such as John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, and Don DeLillo.[495]
- |
  The transcendentalists, led by Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, established the first major American philosophical movement. After the Civil War, Charles Sanders Peirce and then William James and John Dewey were leaders in the development of pragmatism. In the 20th century, the work of W. V. O. Quine and Richard Rorty, and later Noam Chomsky, brought analytic philosophy to the fore of American philosophical academia. John Rawls and Robert Nozick led a revival of political philosophy. Cornel West and Judith Butler have led a continental tradition in American philosophical academia. Chicago school economists like Milton Friedman, James M. Buchanan, and Thomas Sowell have impacted various fields in social and political philosophy.[496][497]

  In the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[498]Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[499]

  One of the first major promoters of American theater was impresario P. T. Barnum, who began operating a lower Manhattan entertainment complex in 1841. The team of Harrigan and Hart produced a series of popular musical comedies in New York starting in the late 1870s. In the 20th century, the modern musical form emerged on Broadway; the songs of musical theater composers such as Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Stephen Sondheim have become pop standards. Playwright Eugene O'Neill won the Nobel literature prize in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple Pulitzer Prize winners Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, and August Wilson.[501]

  Though little known at the time, Charles Ives's work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music. Choreographers Isadora Duncan and Martha Graham helped create modern dance, while George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins were leaders in 20th-century ballet. Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and Ansel Adams.[502]

  The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s.[503]
- |
  Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America's most celebrated songwriters and James Brown led the development of funk. More recent American creations include hip hop and house music. American pop stars such as Presley, Michael Jackson, and Madonna have become global celebrities,[503] as have contemporary musical artists such as Taylor Swift, Britney Spears, Katy Perry, and Beyoncé as well as hip hop artists Jay Z, Eminem and Kanye West.[504] Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales.[505][506][507]

  Hollywood, a northern district of Los Angeles, California, is one of the leaders in motion picture production.[508] The world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope.[509] The next year saw the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New York, and the United States was in the forefront of sound film's development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[510]
- |
  Director D. W. Griffith, American's top filmmaker during the silent film period, was central to the development of film grammar, and producer/entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising.[511] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West and history, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting, with great influence on subsequent directors. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the "Golden Age of Hollywood", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[512] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[513][514] In the 1970s, film directors such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Robert Altman were a vital component in what became known as "New Hollywood" or the "Hollywood Renaissance",[515] grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[516] Since, directors such as Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and James Cameron have gained renown for their blockbuster films, often characterized by high production costs, and in return, high earnings at the box office, with Cameron's Avatar (2009) earning more than $2 billion.[517]

  While most major U.S. sports have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular in other countries. Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact.[525] The Iroquois field their own separate national team, the Iroquois Nationals, in recognition of the confederacy's creation of lacrosse. Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The United States has won 2,400 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, more than any other country, and 281 in the Winter Olympic Games, the second most behind Norway.[526]

  The market for professional sports in the United States is roughly $69 billion, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[527]Baseball has been regarded as the national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball (MLB) being the top league, while American football is now by several measures the most popular spectator sport,[528] with the National Football League (NFL) having the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world and a Super Bowl watched by millions globally. Basketball and ice hockey are the country's next two leading professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Hockey League (NHL). These four major sports, when played professionally, each occupy a season at different, but overlapping, times of the year. College football and basketball attract large audiences.[529]

  Boxing and horse racing were once the most watched individual sports,[530] but they have been eclipsed by golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR.[531] In the 21st century, televised mixed martial arts has also gained a strong following of regular viewers.[532][533] While soccer is less popular in the United States compared to many other nations, the country hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the men's national soccer team has been to the past six World Cups. The United States women's national soccer team won the women's world cup three times, highest in the world.[534]Major League Soccer is the professional soccer league in the United States.

  The United States energy market is about 29,000 terawatt hours per year.[552]Energy consumption per capita is 7.8 tons of oil equivalent per year, the 10th highest rate in the world. In 2005, 40% of this energy came from petroleum, 23% from coal, and 22% from natural gas. The remainder was supplied by nuclear power and renewable energy sources.[553] The United States is the world's largest consumer of petroleum.[554]
- |
  For decades, nuclear power has played a limited role relative to many other developed countries, in part because of public perception in the wake of a 1979 accident. In 2007, several applications for new nuclear plants were filed.[555] The United States has 27% of global coal reserves.[556] It is the world's largest producer of natural gas and crude oil.[557]

  Water supply and sanitation

  Main article: Water supply and sanitation in the United States

  Issues that affect water supply and sanitation in the United States include water scarcity, pollution, a backlog of investment, concerns about the affordability of water for the poorest, and a rapidly retiring workforce. Increased variability and intensity of rainfall as a result of climate change is expected to produce both more severe droughts and flooding, with potentially serious consequences for water supply and for pollution from combined sewer overflows.[558][559] Droughts are likely to particularly affect the 66 percent of Americans whose communities depend on surface water.[560] As for drinking water quality, there are concerns about disinfection by-products, lead, perchlorates and pharmaceutical substances, but generally drinking water quality in the U.S. is good.[561]
- |
  Cities, utilities, state governments and the federal government have addressed the above issues in various ways. To keep pace with demand from an increasing population, utilities traditionally have augmented supplies. However, faced with increasing costs and droughts, water conservation is beginning to receive more attention and is being supported through the federal WaterSense program. The reuse of treated wastewater for non-potable uses is also becoming increasingly common. Pollution through wastewater discharges, a major issue in the 1960s, has been brought largely under control.
- |
  Most Americans are served by publicly owned water and sewer utilities. Eleven percent of Americans receive water from private (so-called "investor-owned") utilities. In rural areas, cooperatives often provide drinking water. Finally, up to 15 percent of Americans are served by their own wells.[562][563] Water supply and wastewater systems are regulated by state governments and the federal government. At the state level, health and environmental regulation is entrusted to the corresponding state-level departments. Public Utilities Commissions or Public Service Commissions regulate tariffs charged by private utilities. In some states they also regulate tariffs by public utilities. At the federal level, drinking water quality and wastewater discharges are regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, which also provides funding to utilities through State Revolving Funds.[564][565][566]
- |
  Water consumption in the United States is more than double that in Central Europe, with large variations among the states. In 2002 the average American family spent $474 on water and sewerage charges,[567] which is about the same level as in Europe. The median household spent about 1.1 percent of its income on water and sewerage.[568]

  The United States has been a leader in scientific research and technological innovation since the late 19th century. Methods for producing Interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories during the first half of the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor saving techniques created the system called mass production.[569]
- |
  In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone. Thomas Edison's research laboratory, one of the first of its kind, developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera.[570] The latter lead to emergence of the worldwide entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The Wright brothers, in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.[571]
- |
  The rise of Nazism in the 1930s led many European scientists, including Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and John von Neumann, to immigrate to the United States.[572] During World War II, the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic Age, while the Space Race produced rapid advances in rocketry, materials science, and aeronautics.[573][574]
- |
  The invention of the transistor in the 1950s, a key active component in practically all modern electronics, led to many technological developments and a significant expansion of the U.S. technology industry.[575][576][577] This in turn led to the establishment of many new technology companies and regions around the county such as Silicon Valley in California. Advancements by American microprocessor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel along with both computer software and hardware companies that include Adobe Systems, Apple Computer, IBM, GNU-Linux, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems created and popularized the personal computer. The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department requirements, and became the first of a series of networks which evolved into the Internet.[578]
- |
  These advancements then lead to greater personalization of technology for individual use.[579] As of 2013[update], 83.8% of American households owned at least one computer, and 73.3% had high-speed Internet service.[580] 91% of Americans also own a mobile phone as of May 2013[update].[581] The United States ranks highly with regard to freedom of use of the internet.[582]

  In 2010, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic accidents caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer's disease, drug abuse, kidney disease and cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.[587] U.S. teenage pregnancy and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other Western nations, especially among blacks and Hispanics.[594] U.S. underage drinking among teenagers is among the lowest in industrialized nations.[595]

  The U.S. is a global leader in medical innovation. America solely developed or contributed significantly to 9 of the top 10 most important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by a 2001 poll of physicians, while the EU and Switzerland together contributed to five.[596] Since 1966, more Americans have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine than the rest of the world combined. From 1989 to 2002, four times more money was invested in private biotechnology companies in America than in Europe.[597] The U.S. health-care system far outspends any other nation, measured in both per capita spending and percentage of GDP.[598]

  Health-care coverage in the United States is a combination of public and private efforts and is not universal. In 2014, 13.4% of the population did not carry health insurance.[599] The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue.[600][601] In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance.[602]Federal legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health insurance system around the country by 2014, though the bill and its ultimate impact are issues of controversy.[603][604]

  The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and Fox. The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[605] Americans listen to radio programming, also largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day.[606]
- |
  In 1998, the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions and corporate underwriting. Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR (formerly National Public Radio). NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967; its television counterpart, PBS, was also created by the same legislation. (NPR and PBS are operated separately from each other.) As of September 30, 2014[update], there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the US according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[607]

  Well-known newspapers are The New York Times, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal. Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have "alternative weeklies" to complement the mainstream daily papers, for example, New York City's The Village Voice or Los Angeles' LA Weekly, to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups. Early versions of the American newspaper comic strip and the American comic book began appearing in the 19th century. In 1938, Superman, the comic book superhero of DC Comics, developed into an American icon.[608] Aside from web portals and search engines, the most popular websites are Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Yahoo.com, eBay, Amazon and Twitter.[609]

  ^ Beginning between 1945, 1954, 1962 (depending on different sources) and ending in the mid-1970s. Several start dates of the war are given by different sources: 1945,[135] 1954,[136] 1959,[137] and 1962;[138] the end date is also debated.

  ^ Kennedy, Paul (1989). The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers. New York: Vintage. p. 358. ISBN 0-679-72019-7. Indeed, World War II ushered in the zenith of U.S. power in what came to be called the American Century, as Leffler 2010, p. 67, indicates: "Truman presided over the greatest military and economic power the world had ever known. War production had lifted the United States out of the Great Depression and had inaugurated an era of unimagined prosperity. Gross national product increased by 60 percent during the war, total earnings by 50 percent. Despite social unrest, labor agitation, racial conflict, and teenage vandalism, Americans had more discretionary income than ever before. Simultaneously, the U.S. government had built up the greatest war machine in human history. By the end of 1942, the United States was producing more arms than all the Axis states combined, and, in 1943, it made almost three times more armaments than did the Soviet Union. In 1945, the United States had two-thirds of the world's gold reserves, three-fourths of its invested capital, half of its shipping vessels, and half of its manufacturing capacity. Its GNP was three times that of the Soviet Union and more than five times that of Britain.

- '} );The United States of America (USA), commonly referred to as the United States
  (U.S.) or America, is a federal republic[19][20] composed of 50 states, a federal
  district, five major territories and various possessions.[fn 1][fn 2] The 48 contiguous
  states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico.
  The state of Alaska is in the northwestern part of North America and the state of
  Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories are scattered about
  the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. At 3.8 million square miles (9.842 million
  km2)[18] and with over 320 million people, the country is the world''s third or
  fourth-largest by total area[fn 3] and the third most populous. It is one of the
  world''s most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale
  immigration from many countries.[26] The geography and climate of the United States
  are also extremely diverse, and the country is home to a wide variety of wildlife.[27]Paleo-Indians
  migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland at least 15,000 years ago,[28]
  with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged
  from 13 British colonies along the East Coast. Disputes between Great Britain and
  the colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were
  fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13
  colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783
  with recognition of the independence of the United States by the Kingdom of Great
  Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial
  empire.[29] The country''s constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787, and ratified
  by the states in 1788. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of
  Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.Driven
  by the doctrine of Manifest Destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion
  across North America throughout the 19th century.[30] This involved displacing American
  Indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states, until
  by 1848 the nation spanned the continent.[30] During the second half of the 19th
  century, the American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country.[31][32] By the
  end of that century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean,[33] and
  its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar.[34]
  The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country''s status as a global
  military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower,
  the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare,
  and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold
  War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the
  world''s sole superpower.[35]The United States is a developed country and has the
  world''s largest national economy by nominal and real GDP, benefiting from an abundance
  of natural resources and high worker productivity.[36] While the U.S. economy is
  considered post-industrial, the country continues to be one of the world''s largest
  manufacturers.[37] Accounting for 34% of global military spending[38] and 23% of
  world GDP,[39] it is the world''s foremost military and economic power, a prominent
  political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological
  innovations.[40]In 1507, the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller produced a
  world map on which he named the lands of the Western Hemisphere "America" after
  the Italian explorer and cartographer Amerigo Vespucci (Latin: Americus Vespucius).[41]
  The first documentary evidence of the phrase "United States of America" is from
  a letter dated January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, Esq., George Washington''s
  aide-de-camp and Muster-Master General of the Continental Army. Addressed to Lt.
  Col. Joseph Reed, Moylan expressed his wish to carry the "full and ample powers
  of the United States of America" to Spain to assist in the revolutionary war effort.[42]The
  first known publication of the phrase "United States of America" was in an anonymous
  essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia, on April 6, 1776.[43][44]
  In June 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote the phrase "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA" in all
  capitalized letters in the headline of his "original Rough draught" of the Declaration
  of Independence.[45][46] In the final Fourth of July version of the Declaration,
  the title was changed to read, "The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united
  States of America".[47] In 1777 the Articles of Confederation announced, "The Stile
  of this Confederacy shall be ''The United States of America''".[48] The preamble
  of the Constitution states "...establish this Constitution for the United States
  of America."The short form "United States" is also standard. Other common forms
  are the "U.S.", the "USA", and "America". Colloquial names are the "U.S. of A."
  and, internationally, the "States". "Columbia", a name popular in poetry and songs
  of the late 1700s, derives its origin from Christopher Columbus; it appears in the
  name "District of Columbia".[49] In non-English languages, the name is frequently
  the translation of either the "United States" or "United States of America", and
  colloquially as "America". In addition, an abbreviation (e.g. USA) is sometimes
  used.[50]The phrase "United States" was originally plural, a description of a collection
  of independent states—e.g., "the United States are"—including in the Thirteenth
  Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1865. The singular form—e.g.,
  "the United States is"— became popular after the end of the American Civil War.
  The singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained in the idiom "these
  United States".[51] The difference is more significant than usage; it is a difference
  between a collection of states and a unit.[52]A citizen of the United States is
  an "American". "United States", "American" and "U.S." refer to the country adjectivally
  ("American values", "U.S. forces"). "American" rarely refers to subjects not connected
  with the United States.[53]The first inhabitants of North America migrated from
  Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago,
  though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival.[28] Some, such as the
  pre-Columbian Mississippian culture, developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture,
  and state-level societies. After the Spanish conquistadors made the first contacts,
  the native population declined for various reasons, primarily diseases such as smallpox
  and measles. Violence was not a significant factor in the overall decline, though
  it impacted specific tribes and colonial settlements.[54][55][56][57][58][59] In
  the Hawaiian Islands the earliest indigenous inhabitants arrived around 1 AD from
  Polynesia. Captain James Cook arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in 1778[60] with American
  contact made in 1790 with the first ship to dock arriving in Oahu.[61]In the early
  days of colonization many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease,
  and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with
  neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their colonial wars.[62] At the
  same time, however, many natives and settlers came to depend on each other. Settlers
  traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other European
  wares.[63] Natives taught many settlers where, when and how to cultivate corn, beans
  and squash. European missionaries and others felt it was important to "civilize"
  the Indians and urged them to adopt European agricultural techniques and lifestyles.[64][65]After
  Columbus'' first voyage to the New World in 1492, other explorers followed with
  settlement into the Floridas and the American Southwest.[66][67] There were also
  some French attempts to colonize the east coast, and later more successful settlements
  along the Mississippi River. Successful English settlement on the eastern coast
  of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and the Pilgrims''
  Plymouth Colony in 1620. Early experiments in communal living failed until the introduction
  of private farm holdings.[68] Many settlers were dissenting Christian groups who
  came seeking religious freedom. The continent''s first elected legislative assembly,
  Virginia''s House of Burgesses created in 1619, and the Mayflower Compact, signed
  by the Pilgrims before disembarking, established precedents for the pattern of representative
  self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American
  colonies.[69][70]Most settlers in every colony were small farmers, but other industries
  developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements. Cash crops included
  tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber.
  Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period Americans
  were producing one-seventh of the world''s iron supply.[71] Cities eventually dotted
  the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists
  were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As coastal land grew
  more expensive freed indentured servants pushed further west.[72]Slave cultivation
  of cash crops began with the Spanish in the 1500s, and was adopted by the English,
  but life expectancy was much higher in North America because of less disease and
  better food and treatment, leading to a rapid increase in the numbers of slaves.[73][74][75]
  Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of
  slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice.[76][77] But by the
  turn of the 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for
  cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.[78]With the British colonization
  of Georgia in 1732, the 13 colonies that would become the United States of America
  were established.[79] All had local governments with elections open to most free
  men, with a growing devotion to the ancient rights of Englishmen and a sense of
  self-government stimulating support for republicanism.[80] With extremely high birth
  rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly.
  Relatively small Native American populations were eclipsed.[81] The Christian revivalist
  movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in
  both religion and religious liberty.[82]In the French and Indian War, British forces
  seized Canada from the French, but the francophone population remained politically
  isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans, who were being
  conquered and displaced, those 13 colonies had a population of over 2.1 million
  in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate
  of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans
  had been born overseas.[83] The colonies'' distance from Britain had allowed the
  development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically
  seek to reassert royal authority.[84]The American Revolutionary War was the first
  successful colonial war of independence against a European power. Americans had
  developed an ideology of "republicanism" asserting that government rested on the
  will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures. They demanded their
  rights as Englishmen, "no taxation without representation". The British insisted
  on administering the empire through Parliament, and the conflict escalated into
  war.[85]Following the passage of the Lee Resolution, on July 2, 1776, which was
  the actual vote for independence, the Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence,
  on July 4, which proclaimed, in a long preamble, that humanity is created equal
  in their unalienable rights and that those rights were not being protected by Great
  Britain, and finally declared, in the words of the resolution, that the Thirteen
  Colonies were independent states and had no allegiance to the British crown in the
  United States. The fourth day of July is celebrated annually as Independence Day.
  In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a weak government that operated
  until 1789.[86]Britain recognized the independence of the United States following
  their defeat at Yorktown.[87] In the peace treaty of 1783, American sovereignty
  was recognized from the Atlantic coast west to the Mississippi River. Nationalists
  led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution,
  ratified in state conventions in 1788. The federal government was reorganized into
  three branches, on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances, in 1789.
  George Washington, who had led the revolutionary army to victory, was the first
  president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal
  restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections,
  was adopted in 1791.[88]Although the federal government criminalized the international
  slave trade in 1808, after 1820 cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop
  exploded in the Deep South, and along with it the slave population.[89][90][91]
  The Second Great Awakening, beginning about 1800, converted millions to evangelical
  Protestantism. In the North it energized multiple social reform movements, including
  abolitionism;[92] in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave
  populations.[93]Americans'' eagerness to expand westward prompted a long series
  of American Indian Wars.[94] The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory
  in 1803 almost doubled the nation''s size.[95] The War of 1812, declared against
  Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism.[96]
  A series of U.S. military incursions into Florida led Spain to cede it and other
  Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[97] Expansion was aided by steam power, when steamboats
  began traveling along America''s large water systems, which were connected by new
  canals, such as the Erie and the I&M; then, even faster railroads began their stretch
  across the nation''s land.[98]From 1820 to 1850, Jacksonian democracy began a set
  of reforms which included wider male suffrage; it led to the rise of the Second
  Party System of Democrats and Whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854. The
  Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that moved Indians
  into the west to their own reservations. The U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas
  in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest destiny.[99] The 1846 Oregon Treaty
  with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[100] Victory
  in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and
  much of the present-day American Southwest.[101]The California Gold Rush of 1848–49
  spurred western migration and the creation of additional western states.[102] After
  the American Civil War, new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for
  settlers, expanded internal trade and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[103]
  Over a half-century, the loss of the American bison (sometimes called "buffalo")
  was an existential blow to many Plains Indians cultures.[104] In 1869, a new Peace
  Policy sought to protect Native-Americans from abuses, avoid further war, and secure
  their eventual U.S. citizenship, although conflicts, including several of the largest
  Indian Wars, continued throughout the West into the 1900s.[105]Differences of opinion
  and social order between northern and southern states in early United States society,
  particularly regarding Black slavery, ultimately led the U.S. into the American
  Civil War.[106] Initially, states entering the Union alternated between slave and
  free states, keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped
  slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional
  western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and free states
  mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, whether
  and how to expand or restrict slavery.[107]With the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln,
  the first president from the largely anti-slavery Republican Party, conventions
  in thirteen states ultimately declared secession and formed the Confederate States
  of America, while the U.S. federal government maintained that secession was illegal.[107]
  The ensuing war was at first for Union, then after 1863 as casualties mounted and
  Lincoln delivered his Emancipation Proclamation, a second war aim became abolition
  of slavery. The war remains the deadliest military conflict in American history,
  resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians.[108]Following
  the Union victory in 1865, three amendments to the U.S. Constitution brought about
  the prohibition of slavery, gave U.S. citizenship to the nearly four million African
  Americans who had been slaves,[109] and promised them voting rights. The war and
  its resolution led to a substantial increase in federal power[110] aimed at reintegrating
  and rebuilding the Southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed
  slaves.[111] Following the Reconstruction Era, throughout the South Jim Crow laws
  soon effectively disenfranchised most blacks and some poor whites. Over the subsequent
  decades, in both the North and the South blacks and some whites faced systemic discrimination,
  including racial segregation and occasional vigilante violence, sparking national
  movements against these abuses.[111]In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented
  influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor
  for the country''s industrialization and transformed its culture.[112] National
  infrastructure including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic
  growth and greater settlement and development of the American Old West. The later
  invention of electric light and the telephone would also impact communication and
  urban life.[113]The end of the Indian Wars further expanded acreage under mechanical
  cultivation, increasing surpluses for international markets.[114] Mainland expansion
  was completed by the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.[115] In 1893, pro-American
  elements in Hawaii overthrew the monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii, which
  the U.S. annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain
  in the same year, following the Spanish–American War.[116]Rapid economic development
  at the end of the 19th century produced many prominent industrialists, and the U.S.
  economy became the world''s largest.[117] Dramatic changes were accompanied by social
  unrest and the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[118] This period
  eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms
  in many societal areas, including women''s suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation
  of consumer goods, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention
  to worker conditions.The United States remained neutral from the outbreak of World
  War I, in 1914, until 1917 when it joined the war as an "associated power", alongside
  the formal Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers.
  In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the Paris Peace
  Conference and advocated strongly for the U.S. to join the League of Nations. However,
  the Senate refused to approve this, and did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles
  that established the League of Nations.[119]In 1920, the women''s rights movement
  won passage of a constitutional amendment granting women''s suffrage.[120] The 1920s
  and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early
  television.[121] The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street
  Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression. After his election as president
  in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal, which included the establishment
  of the Social Security system.[122] The Great Migration of millions of African Americans
  out of the American South began around WWI and extended through the 1960s;[123]
  whereas the Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and
  spurred a new wave of western migration.[124]The United States was at first effectively
  neutral during World War II''s early stages but began supplying material to the
  Allies in March 1941 through the Lend-Lease program. On December 7, 1941, the Empire
  of Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, prompting the United States
  to join the Allies against the Axis powers.[125] During the war, the United States
  was referred as one of the "Four Policemen"[126] of Allies power who met to plan
  the post-war world, along with Britain, the Soviet Union and China.[127][128] Though
  the nation lost more than 400,000 soldiers,[129] it emerged relatively undamaged
  from the war with even greater economic and military influence.[130]Allied conferences
  at Bretton Woods and Yalta outlined a new system of international organizations
  that placed the United States and Soviet Union at the center of world affairs. As
  an Allied victory was won in Europe, a 1945 international conference held in San
  Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became active after the war.[131]
  The United States developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan; the
  Japanese surrendered on September 2, ending World War II.[132]After World War II
  the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed for power during what is known as
  the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism[133]
  and, according to the school of geopolitics, a divide between the maritime Atlantic
  and the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe,
  with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies
  on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of
  communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed
  powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.The
  U.S. often opposed Third World movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored. American
  troops fought communist Chinese and North Korean forces in the Korean War of 1950–53.[134]
  The Soviet Union''s 1957 launch of the first artificial satellite and its 1961 launch
  of the first manned spaceflight initiated a "Space Race" in which the United States
  became the first nation to land a man on the moon in 1969.[134] A proxy war in Southeast
  Asia eventually evolved into full American participation, as the Vietnam War.[fn
  4]At home, the U.S. experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid growth
  of its population and middle class. Construction of an Interstate Highway System
  transformed the nation''s infrastructure over the following decades. Millions moved
  from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments.[141][142] In
  1959 Hawaii became the 50th and last state added to the US.[143] A growing civil
  rights movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination, with
  Martin Luther King, Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead. A combination
  of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
  sought to end racial discrimination.[144][145][146] Meanwhile, a counterculture
  movement grew which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war, black nationalism,
  and the sexual revolution. The launch of a "War on Poverty" expanded entitlement
  and welfare spending.[147]The 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation.
  After his election in 1980, President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation
  with free-market oriented reforms. Following the collapse of détente, he abandoned
  "containment" and initiated the more aggressive "rollback" strategy towards the
  USSR.[148][149][150][151][152] After a surge in female labor participation over
  the previous decade, by 1985 the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[153]The
  late 1980s brought a "thaw" in relations with the USSR, and its collapse in 1991
  finally ended the Cold War.[154][155][156][157] This brought about unipolarity[158]
  with the U.S. unchallenged as the world''s dominant superpower. The concept of Pax
  Americana, which had appeared in the post-World War II period, gained wide popularity
  as a term for the post-Cold War new world order.After the Cold War, the 1990s saw
  the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history, ending in 2001.[159]Originating
  in U.S. defense networks, the Internet spread to international academic networks,
  and then to the public in the 1990s, greatly impacting the global economy, society,
  and culture.[160] On September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda terrorists struck the World Trade
  Center in New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000
  people.[161] In response, the United States launched the War on Terror, which includes
  the ongoing war in Afghanistan and the 2003–11 Iraq War.[162][163]Beginning in 1994,
  the U.S. entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), linking 450
  million people producing $17 trillion worth of goods and services. The goal of the
  agreement was to eliminate trade and investment barriers among the U.S., Canada,
  and Mexico by January 1, 2008; trade among the partners has soared since the agreement
  went into force.[164]Barack Obama, the first African American,[165] and multiracial[166]
  president, was elected in 2008 amid the Great Recession,[167] which began in December
  2007 and ended in June 2009.[168]The land area of the contiguous United States is
  2,959,064 square miles (7.7 Mm2). Alaska, separated from the contiguous United States
  by Canada, is the largest state at 663,268 square miles (1.7 Mm2). Hawaii, occupying
  an archipelago in the central Pacific, southwest of North America, is 10,931 square
  miles (28,311 km2) in area. The populated territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa,
  Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and US Virgin Islands together cover 9,185 square
  miles (23,789 km2)[169]The United States is the world''s third or fourth largest
  nation by total area (land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and just
  above or below China. The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed
  by China and India are counted and how the total size of the United States is measured:
  calculations range from 3,676,486 square miles (9.5 Mm2)[170] to 3,717,813 square
  miles (9.6 Mm2)[171] to 3,794,101 square miles (9.8 Mm2)[5] to 3,805,927 square
  miles (9.9 Mm2).[18] Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size
  behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada.[172]The coastal plain of the Atlantic
  seaboard gives way further inland to deciduous forests and the rolling hills of
  the Piedmont.[173] The Appalachian Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the
  Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[174] The Mississippi–Missouri River,
  the world''s fourth longest river system, runs mainly north–south through the heart
  of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west,
  interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[174]The Rocky Mountains, at the
  western edge of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, reaching
  altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado.[175] Farther west are the
  rocky Great Basin and deserts such as the Chihuahua and Mojave.[176] The Sierra
  Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast, both ranges reaching
  altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m). The lowest and highest points in the
  contiguous United States are in the state of California,[177] and only about 84
  miles (135 km) apart.[178] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska''s
  Denali (Mount McKinley) is the highest peak in the country and North America.[179]
  Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska''s Alexander and Aleutian Islands,
  and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone
  National Park in the Rockies is the continent''s largest volcanic feature.[180]The
  United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate
  types. To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental
  in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[181] The Great Plains west of the
  100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western mountains have an alpine climate.
  The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in
  coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska.
  Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are
  tropical, as are the populated territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[182]
  Extreme weather is not uncommon—the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone
  to hurricanes, and most of the world''s tornadoes occur within the country, mainly
  in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South.[183]The U.S. ecology is megadiverse:
  about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and
  Alaska, and over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which
  occur on the mainland.[184] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784
  bird species, 311 reptile species, and 295 amphibian species.[185] About 91,000
  insect species have been described.[186] The bald eagle is both the national bird
  and national animal of the United States, and is an enduring symbol of the country
  itself.[187]There are 58 national parks and hundreds of other federally managed
  parks, forests, and wilderness areas.[188] Altogether, the government owns about
  28% of the country''s land area.[189] Most of this is protected, though some is
  leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching; about .86%
  is used for military purposes.[190][191]Environmental issues have been on the national
  agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear
  energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife,
  logging and deforestation,[192][193] and international responses to global warming.[194][195]
  Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental
  Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970.[196] The idea of
  wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness
  Act.[197] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and
  endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States
  Fish and Wildlife Service.[198]The U.S. Census Bureau currently estimates the country''s
  population to be 322,431,000.[200] The U.S. population almost quadrupled during
  the 20th century, from about 76 million in 1900.[201] The third most populous nation
  in the world, after China and India, the United States is the only major industrialized
  nation in which large population increases are projected.[202] In the 1800s the
  average woman had 7.04 children, by the 1900s this number had decreased to 3.56.[203]
  Since the early 1970s the birth rate has been below the replacement rate of 2.1
  with 1.86 children per woman in 2014. Foreign born immigration has caused the US
  population to continue its rapid increase with the foreign born population doubling
  from almost 20 million in 1990 to over 40 million in 2010, representing one third
  of the population increase.[204] The foreign born population reached 45 million
  in 2015.[205]The United States has a very diverse population; 37 ancestry groups
  have more than one million members.[206]German Americans are the largest ethnic
  group (more than 50 million) – followed by Irish Americans (circa 37 million), Mexican
  Americans (circa 31 million) and English Americans (circa 28 million).[207][208]White
  Americans are the largest racial group; Black Americans are the nation''s largest
  racial minority (note that in the U.S. Census, Hispanic and Latino Americans are
  counted as an ethnic group, not a racial group), and third largest ancestry group.[206]Asian
  Americans are the country''s second largest racial minority; the three largest Asian
  American ethnic groups are Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, and Indian Americans.[206]The
  United States has a birth rate of 13 per 1,000, which is 5 births below the world
  average.[209] Its population growth rate is positive at 0.7%, higher than that of
  many developed nations.[210] In fiscal year 2012, over one million immigrants (most
  of whom entered through family reunification) were granted legal residence.[211]Mexico
  has been the leading source of new residents since the 1965 Immigration Act. China,
  India, and the Philippines have been in the top four sending countries every year
  since the 1990s.[212] As of 2012[update], approximately 11.4 million residents are
  illegal immigrants.[213] As of 2015, 47% of all immigrants are Hispanic, 26% are
  Asian, 18% are white and 8% are black. The percentage of immigrants who are Asian
  is increasing while the percentage who are Hispanic is decreasing.[205]According
  to a survey conducted by the Williams Institute, nine million Americans, or roughly
  3.4% of the adult population identify themselves as homosexual, bisexual, or transgender.[214][215]
  A 2012 Gallup poll also concluded that 3.5% of adult Americans identified as LGBT.
  The highest percentage came from the District of Columbia (10%), while the lowest
  state was North Dakota at 1.7%.[216] In a 2013 survey, the Centers for Disease Control
  and Prevention found that 96.6% of Americans identify as straight, while 1.6% identify
  as gay or lesbian, and 0.7% identify as being bisexual.[217]In 2010, the U.S. population
  included an estimated 5.2 million people with some American Indian or Alaska Native
  ancestry (2.9 million exclusively of such ancestry) and 1.2 million with some native
  Hawaiian or Pacific island ancestry (0.5 million exclusively).[218] The census counted
  more than 19 million people of "Some Other Race" who were "unable to identify with
  any" of its five official race categories in 2010.[218]The population growth of
  Hispanic and Latino Americans (the terms are officially interchangeable) is a major
  demographic trend. The 50.5 million Americans of Hispanic descent[218] are identified
  as sharing a distinct "ethnicity" by the Census Bureau; 64% of Hispanic Americans
  are of Mexican descent.[219] Between 2000 and 2010, the country''s Hispanic population
  increased 43% while the non-Hispanic population rose just 4.9%.[220] Much of this
  growth is from immigration; in 2007, 12.6% of the U.S. population was foreign-born,
  with 54% of that figure born in Latin America.[221]Fertility is also a factor; in
  2010 the average Hispanic woman gave birth to 2.35 children in her lifetime, compared
  to 1.97 for non-Hispanic black women and 1.79 for non-Hispanic white women (both
  below the replacement rate of 2.1).[222]Minorities (as defined by the Census Bureau
  as all those beside non-Hispanic, non-multiracial whites) constituted 36.3% of the
  population in 2010 (this is nearly 40% in 2015),[223] and over 50% of children under
  age one,[224] and are projected to constitute the majority by 2042.[225] This contradicts
  the report by the National Vital Statistics Reports, based on the U.S. census data,
  which concludes that 54% (2,162,406 out of 3,999,386 in 2010) of births were non-Hispanic
  white.[222] The Hispanic birth rate plummeted 25% between 2006 and 2013 while the
  rate for non-Hispanics decreased just 5%.[226]About 82% of Americans live in urban
  areas (including suburbs);[5] about half of those reside in cities with populations
  over 50,000.[227] The US has numerous clusters of cities known as megaregions, the
  largest being the Great Lakes Megalopolis followed by the Northeast Megalopolis
  and Southern California. In 2008, 273 incorporated places had populations over 100,000,
  nine cities had more than one million residents, and four global cities had over
  two million (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston).[228] There are 52
  metropolitan areas with populations greater than one million.[229] Of the 50 fastest-growing
  metro areas, 47 are in the West or South.[230] The metro areas of San Bernardino,
  Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and Phoenix all grew by more than a million people between
  2000 and 2008.[229]English (American English) is the de facto national language.
  Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S.
  naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2010, about 230 million, or
  80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish,
  spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and
  the most widely taught second language.[232][233] Some Americans advocate making
  English the country''s official language, as it is in 28 states.[13]Both Hawaiian
  and English are official languages in Hawaii, by state law.[234] Alaska recognizes
  twenty Native languages.[235] While neither has an official language, New Mexico
  has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for
  English and French.[236] Other states, such as California, mandate the publication
  of Spanish versions of certain government documents including court forms.[237]
  Many jurisdictions with large numbers of non-English speakers produce government
  materials, especially voting information, in the most commonly spoken languages
  in those jurisdictions.Several insular territories grant official recognition to
  their native languages, along with English: Samoan[238] and Chamorro[239] are recognized
  by American Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro are recognized
  by the Northern Mariana Islands;[240]Cherokee is officially recognized by the Cherokee
  Nation within the Cherokee tribal jurisdiction area in eastern Oklahoma;[241] Spanish
  is an official language of Puerto Rico and is more widely spoken than English there.[242]According
  to the Center for Immigration Studies, Arabic and Urdu (Pakistan''s national language)
  are the fastest growing foreign languages spoken at American households. According
  to the survey, more than 63.2 million US residents speak a language other than English
  at home. In recent years, Arabic speaking residents increased by 29%, Urdu by 23%
  and Persian by 9%.[243]The most widely taught foreign languages at all levels in
  the United States (in terms of enrollment numbers) are: Spanish (around 7.2 million
  students), French (1.5 million), and German (500,000). Other commonly taught languages
  (with 100,000 to 250,000 learners) include Latin, Japanese, American Sign Language,
  Italian, and Chinese.[244][245] 18% of all Americans claim to speak at least one
  language in addition to English.[246]The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution
  guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws
  respecting its establishment. Christianity is by far the most common religion practiced
  in the U.S., but other religions are followed, too. In a 2013 survey, 56% of Americans
  said that religion played a "very important role in their lives", a far higher figure
  than that of any other wealthy nation.[248] In a 2009 Gallup poll 42% of Americans
  said that they attended church weekly or almost weekly; the figures ranged from
  a low of 23% in Vermont to a high of 63% in Mississippi.[249]As with other Western
  countries, the U.S. is becoming less religious. Irreligion is growing rapidly among
  Americans under 30.[250] Polls show that overall American confidence in organized
  religion is declining,[251] and that younger Americans in particular are becoming
  increasingly irreligious.[247][252] According to a 2012 study, Protestant share
  of U.S. population dropped to 48%, thus ending its status as religious category
  of the majority for the first time.[253][254][255] Americans with no religion have
  1.7 children compared to 2.2 among Christians. The unaffiliated are less likely
  to get married with 37% marrying compared to 52% of Christians.[256]According to
  a 2014 survey, 70.6% of adults identified themselves as Christian,[257]Protestant
  denominations accounted for 46.5%, while Roman Catholicism, at 20.8%, was the largest
  individual denomination.[258] The total reporting non-Christian religions in 2014
  was 5.9%.[258] Other religions include Judaism (1.9%), Islam (0.9%), Buddhism (0.7%),
  Hinduism (0.7%).[258] The survey also reported that 22.8% of Americans described
  themselves as agnostic, atheist or simply having no religion, up from 8.2% in 1990.[258][259][260]
  There are also Unitarian Universalist, Baha''i, Sikh, Jain, Shinto, Confucian, Taoist,
  Druid, Native American, Wiccan, humanist and deist communities.[261]Protestantism
  is the largest Christian religious grouping in the United States. Baptists collectively
  form the largest branch of Protestantism, and the Southern Baptist Convention is
  the largest individual Protestant denomination. About 26% of Americans identify
  as Evangelical Protestants, while 15% are Mainline and 7% belong to a traditionally
  Black church. Roman Catholicism in the United States has its origin in the Spanish
  and French colonization of the Americas, and later grew because of Irish, Italian,
  Polish, German and Hispanic immigration. Rhode Island is the only state where a
  majority of the population is Catholic. Lutheranism in the U.S. has its origin in
  immigration from Northern Europe and Germany. North and South Dakota are the only
  states in which a plurality of the population is Lutheran. Presbyterianism was introduced
  in North America by Scottish and Ulster Scots immigrants. Although it has spread
  across the United States, it is heavily concentrated on the East Coast. Dutch Reformed
  congregations were founded first in New Amsterdam (New York City) before spreading
  westward. Utah is the only state where Mormonism is the religion of the majority
  of the population. The Mormon Corridor also extends to parts of Idaho, Nevada and
  Wyoming.[262]The Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the Southern United
  States in which socially conservative Evangelical Protestantism is a significant
  part of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is
  generally higher than the nation''s average. By contrast, religion plays the least
  important role in New England and in the Western United States.[249]As of 2007[update],
  58% of Americans age 18 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced,
  and 25% had never been married.[263] Women now work mostly outside the home and
  receive a majority of bachelor''s degrees.[264]The U.S. teenage pregnancy rate is
  26.5 per 1,000 women. The rate has declined by 57% since 1991.[265] In 2013, the
  highest teenage birth rate was in Alabama, and the lowest in Wyoming.[265][266]Abortion
  is legal throughout the U.S., owing to Roe v. Wade, a 1973 landmark decision by
  the Supreme Court of the United States. While the abortion rate is falling, the
  abortion ratio of 241 per 1,000 live births and abortion rate of 15 per 1,000 women
  aged 15–44 remain higher than those of most Western nations.[267] In 2013, the average
  age at first birth was 26 and 40.6% of births were to unmarried women.[268]The total
  fertility rate (TFR) was estimated for 2013 at 1.86 births per woman.[269]Adoption
  in the United States is common and relatively easy from a legal point of view (compared
  to other Western countries).[270] In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the U.S.
  accounted for nearly half of the total number of adoptions worldwide.[271] It is
  legal for same-sex couples to adopt. Polygamy is illegal throughout the U.S.[272]The
  United States is the world''s oldest surviving federation. It is a constitutional
  republic and representative democracy, "in which majority rule is tempered by minority
  rights protected by law".[273] The government is regulated by a system of checks
  and balances defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country''s supreme
  legal document.[274] For 2014, the U.S. ranked 19th on the Democracy Index[275]
  and 17th on the Corruption Perceptions Index.[276]In the American federalist system,
  citizens are usually subject to three levels of government: federal, state, and
  local. The local government''s duties are commonly split between county and municipal
  governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected
  by a plurality vote of citizens by district. There is no proportional representation
  at the federal level, and it is rare at lower levels.[277]The federal government
  is composed of three branches:The House of Representatives has 435 voting members,
  each representing a congressional district for a two-year term. House seats are
  apportioned among the states by population every tenth year. At the 2010 census,
  seven states had the minimum of one representative, while California, the most populous
  state, had 53.[282]The Senate has 100 members with each state having two senators,
  elected at-large to six-year terms; one third of Senate seats are up for election
  every other year. The President serves a four-year term and may be elected to the
  office no more than twice. The President is not elected by direct vote, but by an
  indirect electoral college system in which the determining votes are apportioned
  to the states and the District of Columbia.[283] The Supreme Court, led by the Chief
  Justice of the United States, has nine members, who serve for life.[284]The state
  governments are structured in roughly similar fashion; Nebraska uniquely has a unicameral
  legislature.[285] The governor (chief executive) of each state is directly elected.
  Some state judges and cabinet officers are appointed by the governors of the respective
  states, while others are elected by popular vote.The original text of the Constitution
  establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its
  relationship with the individual states. Article One protects the right to the "great
  writ" of habeas corpus. The Constitution has been amended 27 times;[286] the first
  ten amendments, which make up the Bill of Rights, and the Fourteenth Amendment form
  the central basis of Americans'' individual rights. All laws and governmental procedures
  are subject to judicial review and any law ruled by the courts to be in violation
  of the Constitution is voided. The principle of judicial review, not explicitly
  mentioned in the Constitution, was established by the Supreme Court in Marbury v.
  Madison (1803)[287] in a decision handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall.[288]The
  United States is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories
  and eleven uninhabited island possessions.[290] The states and territories are the
  principal administrative districts in the country. These are divided into subdivisions
  of counties and independent cities. The District of Columbia is a federal district
  which contains the capital of the United States, Washington DC.[291] The states
  and the District of Columbia choose the President of the United States. Each state
  has presidential electors equal to the number of their Representatives and Senators
  in Congress, the District of Columbia has three.[292]Congressional Districts are
  reapportioned among the states following each decennial Census of Population. Each
  state then draws single member districts to conform with the census apportionment.
  The total number of Representatives is 435, and delegate Members of Congress represent
  the District of Columbia and the five major US territories.[293]The United States
  also observes tribal sovereignty of the Native American nations. Though reservations
  are within state borders, the reservation is a sovereign entity. While the United
  States recognizes this sovereignty, other countries may not.[294]The United States
  has operated under a two-party system for most of its history.[295] For elective
  offices at most levels, state-administered primary elections choose the major party
  nominees for subsequent general elections. Since the general election of 1856, the
  major parties have been the Democratic Party, founded in 1824, and the Republican
  Party, founded in 1854. Since the Civil War, only one third-party presidential candidate—former
  president Theodore Roosevelt, running as a Progressive in 1912—has won as much as
  20% of the popular vote. The third-largest political party is the Libertarian Party.
  The President and Vice-president are elected through the Electoral College system.[296]Within
  American political culture, the Republican Party is considered "conservative" and
  the Democratic Party is considered "liberal".[297][disputed – discuss] The states
  of the Northeast and West Coast and some of the Great Lakes states, known as "blue
  states", are relatively liberal. The "red states" of the South and parts of the
  Great Plains and Rocky Mountains are relatively conservative.The winner of the 2008
  and 2012 presidential elections, Democrat Barack Obama, is the 44th, and current,
  U.S. president. Current leadership in the Senate includes Democratic Vice President
  Joseph Biden, Republican President Pro Tempore (Pro Tem) Orrin Hatch, Majority Leader
  Mitch McConnell, and Minority Leader Harry Reid.[298] Leadership in the House includes
  Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and Minority Leader
  Nancy Pelosi.[299]In the 114th United States Congress, both the House of Representatives
  and the Senate are controlled by the Republican Party. The Senate currently consists
  of 54 Republicans, and 44 Democrats with two independents who caucus with the Democrats;
  the House consists of 246 Republicans and 188 Democrats, with one vacancy.[300]
  In state governorships, there are 31 Republicans, 18 Democrats and one independent.[301]
  Among the DC mayor and the 5 territorial governors, there are 2 Republicans, 2 Democrats
  (one is also in the PPD), and 2 Independents.[302]The United States has an established
  structure of foreign relations. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security
  Council, and New York City is home to the United Nations Headquarters. It is a member
  of the G7,[303]G20, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
  Almost all countries have embassies in Washington, D.C., and many have consulates
  around the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host American diplomatic missions.
  However, Iran, North Korea, Bhutan, and the Republic of China (Taiwan) do not have
  formal diplomatic relations with the United States (although the U.S. still maintains
  relations with Taiwan and supplies it with military equipment).[304]The United States
  has a "special relationship" with the United Kingdom[305] and strong ties with Canada,[306]Australia,[307]New
  Zealand,[308]the Philippines,[309]Japan,[310]South Korea,[311]Israel,[312] and several
  European Union countries, including France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. It works
  closely with fellow NATO members on military and security issues and with its neighbors
  through the Organization of American States and free trade agreements such as the
  trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. In 2008,
  the United States spent a net $25.4 billion on official development assistance,
  the most in the world. As a share of America''s large gross national income (GNI),
  however, the U.S. contribution of 0.18% ranked last among 22 donor states. By contrast,
  private overseas giving by Americans is relatively generous.[313]The U.S. exercises
  full international defense authority and responsibility for three sovereign nations
  through Compact of Free Association with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau,
  all of which are Pacific island nations which were part of the U.S.-administered
  Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands beginning after World War II, and gained
  independence in subsequent years.[314]Taxes are levied in the United States at the
  federal, state and local government level. These include taxes on income, payroll,
  property, sales, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. In 2010 taxes
  collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of GDP.[315]
  During FY2012, the federal government collected approximately $2.45 trillion in
  tax revenue, up $147 billion or 6% versus FY2011 revenues of $2.30 trillion. Primary
  receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,132B or 47%), Social Security/Social
  Insurance taxes ($845B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($242B or 10%).[316] Based on
  CBO Estimates,[317] under 2013 tax law the top 1% will be paying the highest average
  tax rates since 1979, while other income groups will remain at historic lows.[318]U.S.
  taxation is generally progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and is among
  the most progressive in the developed world.[319][320][321][322][323] The highest
  10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes,[324] and about half of all
  taxes.[325] Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no
  tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid
  on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains.[326][327] The historic
  reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs
  have not been viewed as welfare transfers.[328][329] However, according to the Congressional
  Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio
  ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest
  earning quintile, making the system progressive.[330]The top 10% paid 51.8% of total
  federal taxes in 2009, and the top 1%, with 13.4% of pre-tax national income, paid
  22.3% of federal taxes.[331] In 2013 the Tax Policy Center projected total federal
  effective tax rates of 35.5% for the top 1%, 27.2% for the top quintile, 13.8% for
  the middle quintile, and −2.7% for the bottom quintile.[332][333] The incidence
  of corporate income tax has been a matter of considerable ongoing controversy for
  decades.[322][334] State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive
  than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property
  taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams, though their consideration does
  not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.[322][335]During FY 2012,
  the federal government spent $3.54 trillion on a budget or cash basis, down $60
  billion or 1.7% vs. FY 2011 spending of $3.60 trillion. Major categories of FY 2012
  spending included: Medicare & Medicaid ($802B or 23% of spending), Social Security
  ($768B or 22%), Defense Department ($670B or 19%), non-defense discretionary ($615B
  or 17%), other mandatory ($461B or 13%) and interest ($223B or 6%).[316]The total
  national debt in the United States was $18.527 trillion (106% of the GDP), according
  to an estimate for 2014 by the International Monetary Fund.[336] In January 2015,
  U.S. federal government debt held by the public was approximately $13 trillion,
  or about 72% of U.S. GDP. Intra-governmental holdings stood at $5 trillion, giving
  a combined total debt of $18.080 trillion.[337][338] By 2012, total federal debt
  had surpassed 100% of U.S. GDP.[339] The U.S. has a credit rating of AA+ from Standard
  & Poor''s, AAA from Fitch, and AAA from Moody''s.[340]Historically, the U.S. public
  debt as a share of GDP increased during wars and recessions, and subsequently declined.
  For example, debt held by the public as a share of GDP peaked just after World War
  II (113% of GDP in 1945), but then fell over the following 30 years. In recent decades,
  large budget deficits and the resulting increases in debt have led to concern about
  the long-term sustainability of the federal government''s fiscal policies.[341]
  However, these concerns are not universally shared.[342]The President holds the
  title of commander-in-chief of the nation''s armed forces and appoints its leaders,
  the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The United States Department
  of Defense administers the armed forces, including the Army, Navy, Marine Corps,
  and Air Force. The Coast Guard is run by the Department of Homeland Security in
  peacetime and by the Department of the Navy during times of war. In 2008, the armed
  forces had 1.4 million personnel on active duty. The Reserves and National Guard
  brought the total number of troops to 2.3 million. The Department of Defense also
  employed about 700,000 civilians, not including contractors.[343]Military service
  is voluntary, though conscription may occur in wartime through the Selective Service
  System.[344] American forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Force''s large fleet
  of transport aircraft, the Navy''s 10 active aircraft carriers, and Marine expeditionary
  units at sea with the Navy''s Atlantic and Pacific fleets. The military operates
  865 bases and facilities abroad,[345] and maintains deployments greater than 100
  active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.[346]The military budget of the United
  States in 2011 was more than $700 billion, 41% of global military spending and equal
  to the next 14 largest national military expenditures combined. At 4.7% of GDP,
  the rate was the second-highest among the top 15 military spenders, after Saudi
  Arabia.[347] U.S. defense spending as a percentage of GDP ranked 23rd globally in
  2012 according to the CIA.[348] Defense''s share of U.S. spending has generally
  declined in recent decades, from Cold War peaks of 14.2% of GDP in 1953 and 69.5%
  of federal outlays in 1954 to 4.7% of GDP and 18.8% of federal outlays in 2011.[349]The
  proposed base Department of Defense budget for 2012, $553 billion, was a 4.2% increase
  over 2011; an additional $118 billion was proposed for the military campaigns in
  Iraq and Afghanistan.[350] The last American troops serving in Iraq departed in
  December 2011;[351] 4,484 service members were killed during the Iraq War.[352]
  Approximately 90,000 U.S. troops were serving in Afghanistan in April 2012;[353]
  by November 8, 2013 2,285 had been killed during the War in Afghanistan.[354]Law
  enforcement in the United States is primarily the responsibility of local police
  and sheriff''s departments, with state police providing broader services. The New
  York City Police Department (NYPD) is the largest in the country. Federal agencies
  such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service
  have specialized duties, including protecting civil rights, national security and
  enforcing U.S. federal courts'' rulings and federal laws.[356] At the federal level
  and in almost every state, a legal system operates on a common law. State courts
  conduct most criminal trials; federal courts handle certain designated crimes as
  well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. Plea bargaining in the United
  States is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled
  by plea bargain rather than jury trial.[357]In 2012 there were 4.7 murders per 100,000
  persons in the United States, a 54% decline from the modern peak of 10.2 in 1980.[358]
  In 2001–2, the United States had above-average levels of violent crime and particularly
  high levels of gun violence compared to other developed nations.[359] A cross-sectional
  analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2003 showed that
  United States "homicide rates were 6.9 times higher than rates in the other high-income
  countries, driven by firearm homicide rates that were 19.5 times higher."[360][dated
  info]Gun ownership rights continue to be the subject of contentious political debate.From
  1980 through 2008 males represented 77% of homicide victims and 90% of offenders.
  Blacks committed 52.5% of all homicides during that span, at a rate almost eight
  times that of whites ("whites" includes most Hispanics), and were victimized at
  a rate six times that of whites. Most homicides were intraracial, with 93% of black
  victims killed by blacks and 84% of white victims killed by whites.[361] In 2012,
  Louisiana had the highest rate of murder and non-negligent manslaughter in the U.S.,
  and New Hampshire the lowest.[362] The FBI''s Uniform Crime Reports estimates that
  there were 3,246 violent and property crimes per 100,000 residents in 2012, for
  a total of over 9 million total crimes.[363]Capital punishment is sanctioned in
  the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and used in 31 states.[364][365]
  No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in part to a U.S. Supreme Court
  ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In 1976, that Court
  ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally
  be imposed. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority
  of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma.[366] Meanwhile,
  several states have either abolished or struck down death penalty laws. In 2014,
  the country had the fifth highest number of executions in the world, following China,
  Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq.[367]The United States has the highest documented incarceration
  rate and total prison population in the world.[368] At the start of 2008, more than
  2.3 million people were incarcerated, more than one in every 100 adults.[369] At
  year end 2012, the combined U.S. adult correctional systems supervised about 6,937,600
  offenders. About 1 in every 35 adult residents in the United States was under some
  form of correctional supervision at yearend 2012, the lowest rate observed since
  1997.[370] The prison population has quadrupled since 1980.[371] However, the imprisonment
  rate for all prisoners sentenced to more than a year in state or federal facilities
  is 478 per 100,000 in 2013[372] and the rate for pre-trial/remand prisoners is 153
  per 100,000 residents in 2012.[373] The country''s high rate of incarceration is
  largely due to changes in sentencing guidelines and drug policies.[374] According
  to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the majority of inmates held in federal prisons
  are convicted of drug offenses.[375] The privatization of prisons and prison services
  which began in the 1980s has been a subject of debate.[376][377] In 2008, Louisiana
  had the highest incarceration rate,[378] and Maine the lowest.[379]The United States
  has a capitalist mixed economy which is fueled by abundant natural resources and
  high productivity.[388] According to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. GDP
  of $16.8 trillion constitutes 24% of the gross world product at market exchange
  rates and over 19% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity (PPP).[389]The
  US''s nominal GDP is estimated to be $17.528 trillion as of 2014[update][390] From
  1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3%
  weighted average for the rest of the G7.[391] The country ranks ninth in the world
  in nominal GDP per capita and sixth in GDP per capita at PPP.[389] The U.S. dollar
  is the world''s primary reserve currency.[392]The United States is the largest importer
  of goods and second largest exporter, though exports per capita are relatively low.
  In 2010, the total U.S. trade deficit was $635 billion.[393] Canada, China, Mexico,
  Japan, and Germany are its top trading partners.[394] In 2010, oil was the largest
  import commodity, while transportation equipment was the country''s largest export.[393]
  Japan is the largest foreign holder of U.S. public debt.[395] The largest holder
  of the U.S. debt are American entities, including federal government accounts and
  the Federal Reserve, who hold the majority of the debt.[396][397][398][399]The Stockholm
  International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI, found that the United States'' arms
  industry was the world''s biggest exporter of major weapons from 2005–2009,[400]
  and remained the largest exporter of major weapons during a period between 2010–2014,
  followed by Russia, China (PRC), and Germany.[401]In 2009, the private sector was
  estimated to constitute 86.4% of the economy, with federal government activity accounting
  for 4.3% and state and local government activity (including federal transfers) the
  remaining 9.3%.[402] The number of employees at all levels of government outnumber
  those in manufacturing by 1.7 to 1.[403] While its economy has reached a postindustrial
  level of development and its service sector constitutes 67.8% of GDP, the United
  States remains an industrial power.[404] The leading business field by gross business
  receipts is wholesale and retail trade; by net income it is manufacturing.[405]
  In the franchising business model, McDonald''s and Subway are the two most recognized
  brands in the world. Coca-Cola is the most recognized soft drink company in the
  world.[406]Chemical products are the leading manufacturing field.[407] The United
  States is the largest producer of oil in the world, as well as its second largest
  importer.[408] It is the world''s number one producer of electrical and nuclear
  energy, as well as liquid natural gas, sulfur, phosphates, and salt. The National
  Mining Association provides data pertaining to coal and minerals that include beryllium,
  copper, lead, magnesium, zinc, titanium and others.[409][410]Agriculture accounts
  for just under 1% of GDP,[404] yet the United States is the world''s top producer
  of corn[411] and soybeans.[412] The National Agricultural Statistics Service maintains
  agricultural statistics for products that include peanuts, oats, rye, wheat, rice,
  cotton, corn, barley, hay, sunflowers, and oilseeds. In addition, the United States
  Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides livestock statistics regarding beef, poultry,
  pork, and dairy products. The country is the primary developer and grower of genetically
  modified food, representing half of the world''s biotech crops.[413]Consumer spending
  comprises 68% of the U.S. economy in 2015.[414] In August 2010, the American labor
  force consisted of 154.1 million people. With 21.2 million people, government is
  the leading field of employment. The largest private employment sector is health
  care and social assistance, with 16.4 million people. About 12% of workers are unionized,
  compared to 30% in Western Europe.[415] The World Bank ranks the United States first
  in the ease of hiring and firing workers.[416] The United States is ranked among
  the top three in the Global Competitiveness Report as well. It has a smaller welfare
  state and redistributes less income through government action than European nations
  tend to.[417]The United States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee
  its workers paid vacation[418] and is one of just a few countries in the world without
  paid family leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname
  and Liberia.[419] However, 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave,
  according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers
  get the same benefits.[420] While federal law currently does not require sick leave,
  it''s a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations.[420]
  In 2009, the United States had the third highest workforce productivity per person
  in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. It was fourth in productivity per hour,
  behind those two countries and the Netherlands.[421]The 2008–2012 global recession
  had a significant impact on the United States, with output still below potential
  according to the Congressional Budget Office.[422] It brought high unemployment
  (which has been decreasing but remains above pre-recession levels), along with low
  consumer confidence, the continuing decline in home values and increase in foreclosures
  and personal bankruptcies, an escalating federal debt crisis, inflation, and rising
  petroleum and food prices. There remains a record proportion of long-term unemployed,
  continued decreasing household income, and tax and federal budget increases.[423][424][425]Americans
  have the highest average household and employee income among OECD nations, and in
  2007 had the second highest median household income.[426][427] According to the
  Census Bureau real median household income was $50,502 in 2011, down from $51,144
  in 2010.[428] The Global Food Security Index ranked the U.S. number one for food
  affordability and overall food security in March 2013.[429] Americans on average
  have over twice as much living space per dwelling and per person as European Union
  residents, and more than every EU nation.[430] For 2013 the United Nations Development
  Programme ranked the United States 5th among 187 countries in its Human Development
  Index and 28th in its inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI).[431]There has been a widening
  gap between productivity and median incomes since the 1970s.[432] However, the gap
  between total compensation and productivity is not as wide because of increased
  employee benefits such as health insurance.[433] While inflation-adjusted ("real")
  household income had been increasing almost every year from 1947 to 1999, it has
  since been flat on balance and has even decreased recently.[434] According to Congressional
  Research Service, during this same period, immigration to the United States increased,
  while the lower 90% of tax filers incomes became stagnant, and eventually decreasing
  since 2000.[435] The rise in the share of total annual income received by the top
  1 percent, which has more than doubled from 9 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011,
  has had a significant impact on income inequality,[436] leaving the United States
  with one of the widest income distributions among OECD nations.[437] The post-recession
  income gains have been very uneven, with the top 1 percent capturing 95 percent
  of the income gains from 2009 to 2012.[438] The extent and relevance of income inequality
  is a matter of debate.[439][disputed – discuss][440]Wealth, like income and taxes,
  is highly concentrated; the richest 10% of the adult population possess 72% of the
  country''s household wealth, while the bottom half claim only 2%.[441] Between June
  2007 and November 2008 the global recession led to falling asset prices around the
  world. Assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value.[442] Since
  peaking in the second quarter of 2007, household wealth was down $14 trillion, but
  has since increased $14 trillion over 2006 levels.[443][444] At the end of 2014,
  household debt amounted to $11.8 trillion,[445] down from $13.8 trillion at the
  end of 2008.[446]There were about 578,424 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons
  in the U.S. in January 2014, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter
  or transitional housing program.[447] In 2011 16.7 million children lived in food-insecure
  households, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 1.1% of U.S. children,
  or 845,000, saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns at some point during
  the year, and most cases were not chronic.[448] According to a 2014 report by the
  Census Bureau, one in five young adults lives in poverty today, up from one in seven
  in 1980.[449]American public education is operated by state and local governments,
  regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal
  grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of six
  or seven (generally, kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally
  bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow
  students to leave school at 16 or 17.[450]About 12% of children are enrolled in
  parochial or nonsectarian private schools. Just over 2% of children are homeschooled.[451]
  The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world, spending
  more than $11,000 per elementary student in 2010 and more than $12,000 per high
  school student.[452] Some 80% of U.S. college students attend public universities.[453]The
  United States has many competitive private and public institutions of higher education.
  The majority of world''s top universities listed by different ranking organizations
  are in the US.[454][455][456] There are also local community colleges with generally
  more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition. Of Americans
  25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2%
  earned a bachelor''s degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[457] The basic literacy
  rate is approximately 99%.[5][458] The United Nations assigns the United States
  an Education Index of 0.97, tying it for 12th in the world.[459]As for public expenditures
  on higher education, the U.S. trails some other OECD nations but spends more per
  student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and
  private spending.[452][460] As of 2012[update], student loan debt exceeded one trillion
  dollars, more than Americans owe on credit cards.[461]The United States is home
  to many cultures and a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values.[26][462]
  Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations,
  nearly all Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five
  centuries.[463] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived
  from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources,
  such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[26][464] More recent immigration
  from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been
  described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl in
  which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.[26]Core
  American culture was established by Protestant British colonists and shaped by the
  frontier settlement process, with the traits derived passed down to descendants
  and transmitted to immigrants through assimilation. Americans have traditionally
  been characterized by a strong work ethic, competitiveness, and individualism, as
  well as a unifying belief in an "American creed" emphasizing liberty, equality,
  private property, democracy, rule of law, and a preference for limited government.[465]
  Americans are extremely charitable by global standards. According to a 2006 British
  study, Americans gave 1.67% of GDP to charity, more than any other nation studied,
  more than twice the second place British figure of 0.73%, and around twelve times
  the French figure of 0.14%.[466][467]The American Dream, or the perception that
  Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[468]
  Whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate.[469][470][471][472][391][473]
  While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[474]
  scholars identify significant differences between the country''s social classes,
  affecting socialization, language, and values.[475] Americans'' self-images, social
  viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an
  unusually close degree.[476] While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic
  achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.[477]Mainstream
  American cuisine is similar to that in other Western countries. Wheat is the primary
  cereal grain with about three-quarters of grain products made of wheat flour[478]
  and many dishes use indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet
  potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup which were consumed by Native Americans
  and early European settlers.[479] These home grown foods are part of a shared national
  menu on one of America''s most popular holidays; Thanksgiving, when some Americans
  make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion.[480]Characteristic dishes such
  as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes
  of various immigrants. French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos,
  and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed.[482] Americans
  drink three times as much coffee as tea.[483] Marketing by U.S. industries is largely
  responsible for making orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages.[484][485]American
  eating habits owe a great deal to that of their British culinary roots with some
  variations. Although American lands could grow newer vegetables England could not,
  most colonists would not eat these new foods until accepted by Europeans.[486] Over
  time American foods changed to a point that food critic, John L. Hess stated in
  1972: "Our founding fathers were as far superior to our present political leaders
  in the quality of their food as they were in the quality of their prose and intelligence".[487]The
  American fast food industry, the world''s largest,[488] pioneered the drive-through
  format in the 1940s.[489] Fast food consumption has sparked health concerns. During
  the 1980s and 1990s, Americans'' caloric intake rose 24%;[482] frequent dining at
  fast food outlets is associated with what public health officials call the American
  "obesity epidemic".[490] Highly sweetened soft drinks are widely popular, and sugared
  beverages account for nine percent of American caloric intake.[491]In the 18th and
  early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe.
  Writers such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established
  a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain
  and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century''s second half; Emily Dickinson,
  virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American
  poet.[492] A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience
  and character—such as Herman Melville''s Moby-Dick (1851), Twain''s The Adventures
  of Huckleberry Finn (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald''s The Great Gatsby (1925) and Harper
  Lee''s To Kill a Mockingbird (1960)— may be dubbed the "Great American Novel".[493]Eleven
  U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Toni Morrison
  in 1993. William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck are often named among
  the most influential writers of the 20th century.[494] Popular literary genres such
  as the Western and hardboiled crime fiction developed in the United States. The
  Beat Generation writers opened up new literary approaches, as have postmodernist
  authors such as John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, and Don DeLillo.[495]The transcendentalists,
  led by Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, established the first major American philosophical
  movement. After the Civil War, Charles Sanders Peirce and then William James and
  John Dewey were leaders in the development of pragmatism. In the 20th century, the
  work of W. V. O. Quine and Richard Rorty, and later Noam Chomsky, brought analytic
  philosophy to the fore of American philosophical academia. John Rawls and Robert
  Nozick led a revival of political philosophy. Cornel West and Judith Butler have
  led a continental tradition in American philosophical academia. Chicago school economists
  like Milton Friedman, James M. Buchanan, and Thomas Sowell have impacted various
  fields in social and political philosophy.[496][497]In the visual arts, the Hudson
  River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism.
  The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory
  Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public
  and transformed the U.S. art scene.[498]Georgia O''Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and
  others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such
  as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop
  art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States.
  The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects
  such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[499]One of the first
  major promoters of American theater was impresario P. T. Barnum, who began operating
  a lower Manhattan entertainment complex in 1841. The team of Harrigan and Hart produced
  a series of popular musical comedies in New York starting in the late 1870s. In
  the 20th century, the modern musical form emerged on Broadway; the songs of musical
  theater composers such as Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Stephen Sondheim have
  become pop standards. Playwright Eugene O''Neill won the Nobel literature prize
  in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple Pulitzer Prize winners
  Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, and August Wilson.[501]Though little known at
  the time, Charles Ives''s work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S.
  composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell
  and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition.
  Aaron Copland and George Gershwin developed a new synthesis of popular and classical
  music. Choreographers Isadora Duncan and Martha Graham helped create modern dance,
  while George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins were leaders in 20th-century ballet.
  Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography,
  with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and Ansel
  Adams.[502]The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply
  influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European traditions.
  Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music
  were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was
  developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the
  20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the
  1940s.[503]Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock
  and roll. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of
  America''s most celebrated songwriters and James Brown led the development of funk.
  More recent American creations include hip hop and house music. American pop stars
  such as Presley, Michael Jackson, and Madonna have become global celebrities,[503]
  as have contemporary musical artists such as Taylor Swift, Britney Spears, Katy
  Perry, and Beyoncé as well as hip hop artists Jay Z, Eminem and Kanye West.[504]
  Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing
  in worldwide sales.[505][506][507]Hollywood, a northern district of Los Angeles,
  California, is one of the leaders in motion picture production.[508] The world''s
  first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using
  Thomas Edison''s Kinetoscope.[509] The next year saw the first commercial screening
  of a projected film, also in New York, and the United States was in the forefront
  of sound film''s development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century,
  the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although
  in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies
  have been subject to the forces of globalization.[510]Director D. W. Griffith, American''s
  top filmmaker during the silent film period, was central to the development of film
  grammar, and producer/entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film
  and movie merchandising.[511] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of
  the American Old West and history, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened
  the possibilities of cinema with location shooting, with great influence on subsequent
  directors. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to
  as the "Golden Age of Hollywood", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[512]
  with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[513][514]
  In the 1970s, film directors such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Robert
  Altman were a vital component in what became known as "New Hollywood" or the "Hollywood
  Renaissance",[515] grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures
  of the post-war period.[516] Since, directors such as Steven Spielberg, George Lucas
  and James Cameron have gained renown for their blockbuster films, often characterized
  by high production costs, and in return, high earnings at the box office, with Cameron''s
  Avatar (2009) earning more than $2 billion.[517]Notable films topping the American
  Film Institute''s AFI 100 list include Orson Welles''s Citizen Kane (1941), which
  is frequently cited as the greatest film of all time,[518][519]Casablanca (1942),
  The Godfather (1972), Gone with the Wind (1939), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), The
  Wizard of Oz (1939), The Graduate (1967), On the Waterfront (1954), Schindler''s
  List (1993), Singin'' in the Rain (1952), It''s a Wonderful Life (1946) and Sunset
  Boulevard (1950).[520] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been
  held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[521]
  and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[522]While
  most major U.S. sports have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball,
  skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become
  popular in other countries. Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and
  Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact.[525] The Iroquois field
  their own separate national team, the Iroquois Nationals, in recognition of the
  confederacy''s creation of lacrosse. Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the
  United States. The United States has won 2,400 medals at the Summer Olympic Games,
  more than any other country, and 281 in the Winter Olympic Games, the second most
  behind Norway.[526]The market for professional sports in the United States is roughly
  $69 billion, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and
  Africa combined.[527]Baseball has been regarded as the national sport since the
  late 19th century, with Major League Baseball (MLB) being the top league, while
  American football is now by several measures the most popular spectator sport,[528]
  with the National Football League (NFL) having the highest average attendance of
  any sports league in the world and a Super Bowl watched by millions globally. Basketball
  and ice hockey are the country''s next two leading professional team sports, with
  the top leagues being the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National
  Hockey League (NHL). These four major sports, when played professionally, each occupy
  a season at different, but overlapping, times of the year. College football and
  basketball attract large audiences.[529]Boxing and horse racing were once the most
  watched individual sports,[530] but they have been eclipsed by golf and auto racing,
  particularly NASCAR.[531] In the 21st century, televised mixed martial arts has
  also gained a strong following of regular viewers.[532][533] While soccer is less
  popular in the United States compared to many other nations, the country hosted
  the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the men''s national soccer team has been to the past six
  World Cups. The United States women''s national soccer team won the women''s world
  cup three times, highest in the world.[534]Major League Soccer is the professional
  soccer league in the United States.Personal transportation is dominated by automobiles,
  which operate on a network of 4 million miles of public roads,[536] including one
  of the world''s longest highway systems at 57,000 miles.[537] The world''s second
  largest automobile market,[538] the United States has the highest rate of per-capita
  vehicle ownership in the world, with 765 vehicles per 1,000 Americans.[539] About
  40% of personal vehicles are vans, SUVs, or light trucks.[540] The average American
  adult (accounting for all drivers and non-drivers) spends 55 minutes driving every
  day, traveling 29 miles (47 km).[541]Mass transit accounts for 9% of total U.S.
  work trips.[542][543]Transport of goods by rail is extensive, though relatively
  low numbers of passengers (approximately 31 million annually) use intercity rail
  to travel, partly because of the low population density throughout much of the U.S.
  interior.[544][545] However, ridership on Amtrak, the national intercity passenger
  rail system, grew by almost 37% between 2000 and 2010.[546] Also, light rail development
  has increased in recent years.[547] Bicycle usage for work commutes is minimal.[548]The
  civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated
  since 1978, while most major airports are publicly owned.[549] The three largest
  airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is
  number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways.[550] Of the world''s 30 busiest
  passenger airports, 12 are in the United States, including the busiest, Hartsfield–Jackson
  Atlanta International Airport.[551]The United States energy market is about 29,000
  terawatt hours per year.[552]Energy consumption per capita is 7.8 tons of oil equivalent
  per year, the 10th highest rate in the world. In 2005, 40% of this energy came from
  petroleum, 23% from coal, and 22% from natural gas. The remainder was supplied by
  nuclear power and renewable energy sources.[553] The United States is the world''s
  largest consumer of petroleum.[554]For decades, nuclear power has played a limited
  role relative to many other developed countries, in part because of public perception
  in the wake of a 1979 accident. In 2007, several applications for new nuclear plants
  were filed.[555] The United States has 27% of global coal reserves.[556] It is the
  world''s largest producer of natural gas and crude oil.[557]Issues that affect water
  supply and sanitation in the United States include water scarcity, pollution, a
  backlog of investment, concerns about the affordability of water for the poorest,
  and a rapidly retiring workforce. Increased variability and intensity of rainfall
  as a result of climate change is expected to produce both more severe droughts and
  flooding, with potentially serious consequences for water supply and for pollution
  from combined sewer overflows.[558][559] Droughts are likely to particularly affect
  the 66 percent of Americans whose communities depend on surface water.[560] As for
  drinking water quality, there are concerns about disinfection by-products, lead,
  perchlorates and pharmaceutical substances, but generally drinking water quality
  in the U.S. is good.[561]Cities, utilities, state governments and the federal government
  have addressed the above issues in various ways. To keep pace with demand from an
  increasing population, utilities traditionally have augmented supplies. However,
  faced with increasing costs and droughts, water conservation is beginning to receive
  more attention and is being supported through the federal WaterSense program. The
  reuse of treated wastewater for non-potable uses is also becoming increasingly common.
  Pollution through wastewater discharges, a major issue in the 1960s, has been brought
  largely under control.Most Americans are served by publicly owned water and sewer
  utilities. Eleven percent of Americans receive water from private (so-called "investor-owned")
  utilities. In rural areas, cooperatives often provide drinking water. Finally, up
  to 15 percent of Americans are served by their own wells.[562][563] Water supply
  and wastewater systems are regulated by state governments and the federal government.
  At the state level, health and environmental regulation is entrusted to the corresponding
  state-level departments. Public Utilities Commissions or Public Service Commissions
  regulate tariffs charged by private utilities. In some states they also regulate
  tariffs by public utilities. At the federal level, drinking water quality and wastewater
  discharges are regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, which
  also provides funding to utilities through State Revolving Funds.[564][565][566]Water
  consumption in the United States is more than double that in Central Europe, with
  large variations among the states. In 2002 the average American family spent $474
  on water and sewerage charges,[567] which is about the same level as in Europe.
  The median household spent about 1.1 percent of its income on water and sewerage.[568]The
  United States has been a leader in scientific research and technological innovation
  since the late 19th century. Methods for producing Interchangeable parts were developed
  by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories during the first half of the
  19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry,
  enabled the U.S. to have large scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles
  and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system
  of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction
  of the assembly line and other labor saving techniques created the system called
  mass production.[569]In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent
  for the telephone. Thomas Edison''s research laboratory, one of the first of its
  kind, developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first
  viable movie camera.[570] The latter lead to emergence of the worldwide entertainment
  industry. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds
  and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The Wright brothers, in 1903, made
  the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.[571]The rise
  of Nazism in the 1930s led many European scientists, including Albert Einstein,
  Enrico Fermi, and John von Neumann, to immigrate to the United States.[572] During
  World War II, the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic
  Age, while the Space Race produced rapid advances in rocketry, materials science,
  and aeronautics.[573][574]The invention of the transistor in the 1950s, a key active
  component in practically all modern electronics, led to many technological developments
  and a significant expansion of the U.S. technology industry.[575][576][577] This
  in turn led to the establishment of many new technology companies and regions around
  the county such as Silicon Valley in California. Advancements by American microprocessor
  companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel along with both computer
  software and hardware companies that include Adobe Systems, Apple Computer, IBM,
  GNU-Linux, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems created and popularized the personal
  computer. The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department requirements,
  and became the first of a series of networks which evolved into the Internet.[578]These
  advancements then lead to greater personalization of technology for individual use.[579]
  As of 2013[update], 83.8% of American households owned at least one computer, and
  73.3% had high-speed Internet service.[580] 91% of Americans also own a mobile phone
  as of May 2013[update].[581] The United States ranks highly with regard to freedom
  of use of the internet.[582]In the 21st century, 64% of research and development
  funding comes from the private sector.[583] The United States leads the world in
  scientific research papers and impact factor.[584]The United States has a life expectancy
  of 79.8 years at birth, up from 75.2 years in 1990.[585][586][587] Increasing obesity
  in the United States and health improvements elsewhere have contributed to lowering
  the country''s rank in life expectancy from 1987, when it was 11th in the world.[588]Obesity
  rates in the United States are amongst the highest in the world.[589]Approximately
  one-third of the adult population is obese and an additional third is overweight;[590]
  the obesity rate, the highest in the industrialized world, has more than doubled
  in the last quarter-century.[591] Obesity-related type 2 diabetes is considered
  epidemic by health care professionals.[592] The infant mortality rate of 6.17 per
  thousand places the United States 169th highest out of 224 countries, with the 224th
  country having the lowest mortality rate.[593]In 2010, coronary artery disease,
  lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic accidents
  caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal
  disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The
  most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood
  pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer''s disease,
  drug abuse, kidney disease and cancer, and falls caused the most additional years
  of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.[587] U.S. teenage pregnancy
  and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other Western nations, especially
  among blacks and Hispanics.[594] U.S. underage drinking among teenagers is among
  the lowest in industrialized nations.[595]The U.S. is a global leader in medical
  innovation. America solely developed or contributed significantly to 9 of the top
  10 most important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by a 2001 poll of physicians,
  while the EU and Switzerland together contributed to five.[596] Since 1966, more
  Americans have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine than the rest of the world combined.
  From 1989 to 2002, four times more money was invested in private biotechnology companies
  in America than in Europe.[597] The U.S. health-care system far outspends any other
  nation, measured in both per capita spending and percentage of GDP.[598]Health-care
  coverage in the United States is a combination of public and private efforts and
  is not universal. In 2014, 13.4% of the population did not carry health insurance.[599]
  The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue.[600][601]
  In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance.[602]Federal
  legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health
  insurance system around the country by 2014, though the bill and its ultimate impact
  are issues of controversy.[603][604]The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are
  the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), the
  American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and Fox. The four major broadcast television
  networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels
  catering to a variety of niches.[605] Americans listen to radio programming, also
  largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day.[606]In 1998,
  the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and
  5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these
  stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes
  and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions and corporate underwriting.
  Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR (formerly National Public Radio).
  NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967;
  its television counterpart, PBS, was also created by the same legislation. (NPR
  and PBS are operated separately from each other.) As of September 30, 2014[update],
  there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the US according to the U.S.
  Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[607]Well-known newspapers are The New York
  Times, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal. Although the cost of publishing has
  increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing
  newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major
  wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world
  coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately
  owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or
  even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in
  a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities
  often have "alternative weeklies" to complement the mainstream daily papers, for
  example, New York City''s The Village Voice or Los Angeles'' LA Weekly, to name
  two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade
  papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups.
  Early versions of the American newspaper comic strip and the American comic book
  began appearing in the 19th century. In 1938, Superman, the comic book superhero
  of DC Comics, developed into an American icon.[608] Aside from web portals and search
  engines, the most popular websites are Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Yahoo.com,
  eBay, Amazon and Twitter.[609]In Spanish, the second most widely spoken mother tongue
  behind English, more than 800 publications are published.[610][611]'

  English is the de facto language of American government and the sole language spoken
  at home by 80 percent of Americans aged five and older. It is the official language
  of at least 28 states; some sources give higher figures, based on differing definitions
  of \"official\".[13] English and Hawaiian are both official languages in the state
  of Hawaii, and English and twenty Native American languages are official in Alaska.
  Cherokee is an official language in some Native-controlled lands of Oklahoma. French
  is a de facto but nonofficial language in the states of Maine and Louisiana, while
  New Mexico state law grants Spanish a special status.[14][15][16][17]\nb.\n^ In
  five U.S. territories, English as well as one or more indigenous languages are official:
  Spanish in Puerto Rico, Samoan in American Samoa, Chamorro in both Guam and the
  Northern Mariana Islands. Carolinian is also a official language in the Northern
  Mariana Islands.\nc.\n^ Whether the United States or China is larger has been disputed.
  The figure given is from the U.S. Census.[18]\nd.\n^ See Time in the United States
  for details about laws governing time zones in the United States.\ne.\n^ Except
  the United States Virgin Islands.\nThe United States of America (USA), commonly
  referred to as the United States (U.S.) or America, is a federal republic[19][20]
  composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major territories and various possessions.[fn
  1][fn 2] The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America
  between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the northwestern part of North
  America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories
  are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. At 3.8 million square
  miles (9.842 million km2)[18] and with over 320 million people, the country is the
  world's third or fourth-largest by total area[fn 3] and the third most populous.
  It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the
  product of large-scale immigration from many countries.[26] The geography and climate
  of the United States are also extremely diverse, and the country is home to a wide
  variety of wildlife.[27]\nPaleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the
  U.S. mainland at least 15,000 years ago,[28] with European colonization beginning
  in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the
  East Coast. Disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American
  Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the
  American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the
  Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence
  of the United States by the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful
  war of independence against a European colonial empire.[29] The country's constitution
  was adopted on September 17, 1787, and ratified by the states in 1788. The first
  ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and
  designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.\nDriven by the doctrine
  of Manifest Destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North
  America throughout the 19th century.[30] This involved displacing American Indian
  tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states, until by
  1848 the nation spanned the continent.[30] During the second half of the 19th century,
  the American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country.[31][32] By the end of
  that century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean,[33] and its economy,
  driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar.[34] The Spanish–American
  War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The
  United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country
  to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent
  member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution
  of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.[35]\nThe
  United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy
  by nominal and real GDP, benefiting from an abundance of natural resources and high
  worker productivity.[36] While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, the
  country continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers.[37] Accounting
  for 34% of global military spending[38] and 23% of world GDP,[39] it is the world's
  foremost military and economic power, a prominent political and cultural force,
  and a leader in scientific research and technological innovations.[40]\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1

  and Names of the United States\nIn 1507, the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller
  produced a world map on which he named the lands of the Western Hemisphere \"America\"
  after the Italian explorer and cartographer Amerigo Vespucci (Latin: Americus Vespucius).[41]
  The first documentary evidence of the phrase \"United States of America\" is from
  a letter dated January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, Esq., George Washington's
  aide-de-camp and Muster-Master General of the Continental Army. Addressed to Lt.
  Col. Joseph Reed, Moylan expressed his wish to carry the \"full and ample powers
  of the United States of America\" to Spain to assist in the revolutionary war effort.[42]\nThe
  first known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous
  essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia, on April 6, 1776.[43][44]
  In June 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote the phrase \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" in
  all capitalized letters in the headline of his \"original Rough draught\" of the
  Declaration of Independence.[45][46] In the final Fourth of July version of the
  Declaration, the title was changed to read, \"The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen
  united States of America\".[47] In 1777 the Articles of Confederation announced,
  \"The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America'\".[48] The
  preamble of the Constitution states \"...establish this Constitution for the United
  States of America.\"\nThe short form \"United States\" is also standard. Other common
  forms are the \"U.S.\", the \"USA\", and \"America\". Colloquial names are the \"U.S.
  of A.\" and, internationally, the \"States\". \"Columbia\", a name popular in poetry
  and songs of the late 1700s, derives its origin from Christopher Columbus; it appears
  in the name \"District of Columbia\".[49] In non-English languages, the name is
  frequently the translation of either the \"United States\" or \"United States of
  America\", and colloquially as \"America\". In addition, an abbreviation (e.g. USA)
  is sometimes used.[50]\nThe phrase \"United States\" was originally plural, a description
  of a collection of independent states—e.g., \"the United States are\"—including
  in the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1865.
  The singular form—e.g., \"the United States is\"— became popular after the end of
  the American Civil War. The singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained
  in the idiom \"these United States\".[51] The difference is more significant than
  usage; it is a difference between a collection of states and a unit.[52]\nA citizen
  of the United States is an \"American\". \"United States\", \"American\" and \"U.S.\"
  refer to the country adjectivally (\"American values\", \"U.S. forces\"). \"American\"
  rarely refers to subjects not connected with the United States.[53]\nHistory\nMain
  articles: History of the United States, Timeline of United States history, Economic
  history of the United States and Labor history of the United States\n\n\n\n\nNative
  Americans meeting with Europeans, 1764\n\n\nIndigenous and European contact\nFurther
  information: Pre-Columbian era and Colonial history of the United States\nThe first
  inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge
  and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an even
  earlier arrival.[28] Some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture, developed
  advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level societies. After the Spanish
  conquistadors made the first contacts, the native population declined for various
  reasons, primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles. Violence was not a significant
  factor in the overall decline, though it impacted specific tribes and colonial settlements.[54][55][56][57][58][59]
  In the Hawaiian Islands the earliest indigenous inhabitants arrived around 1 AD
  from Polynesia. Captain James Cook arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in 1778[60] with
  American contact made in 1790 with the first ship to dock arriving in Oahu.[61]\nIn
  the early days of colonization many European settlers were subject to food shortages,
  disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at
  war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their colonial wars.[62]
  At the same time, however, many natives and settlers came to depend on each other.
  Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other
  European wares.[63] Natives taught many settlers where, when and how to cultivate
  corn, beans and squash. European missionaries and others felt it was important to
  \"civilize\" the Indians and urged them to adopt European agricultural techniques
  and lifestyles.[64][65]\nSettlements\nFurther information: European colonization
  of the Americas and Thirteen Colonies\nAfter Columbus' first voyage to the New World
  in 1492, other explorers followed with settlement into the Floridas and the American
  Southwest.[66][67] There were also some French attempts to colonize the east coast,
  and later more successful settlements along the Mississippi River. Successful English
  settlement on the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony
  in 1607 at Jamestown and the Pilgrims' Plymouth Colony in 1620. Early experiments
  in communal living failed until the introduction of private farm holdings.[68] Many
  settlers were dissenting Christian groups who came seeking religious freedom. The
  continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's House of Burgesses created
  in 1619, and the Mayflower Compact, signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking,
  established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism
  that would develop throughout the American colonies.[69][70]\n\n\n\n\nThe signing
  of the Mayflower Compact, 1620.\n\n\nMost settlers in every colony were small farmers,
  but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements.
  Cash crops included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs,
  fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial
  period Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply.[71] Cities
  eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs.
  English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As
  coastal land grew more expensive freed indentured servants pushed further west.[72]\nSlave
  cultivation of cash crops began with the Spanish in the 1500s, and was adopted by
  the English, but life expectancy was much higher in North America because of less
  disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid increase in the numbers
  of slaves.[73][74][75] Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and
  moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice.[76][77]
  But by the turn of the 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants
  for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.[78]\nWith the British colonization
  of Georgia in 1732, the 13 colonies that would become the United States of America
  were established.[79] All had local governments with elections open to most free
  men, with a growing devotion to the ancient rights of Englishmen and a sense of
  self-government stimulating support for republicanism.[80] With extremely high birth
  rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly.
  Relatively small Native American populations were eclipsed.[81] The Christian revivalist
  movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in
  both religion and religious liberty.[82]\nIn the French and Indian War, British
  forces seized Canada from the French, but the francophone population remained politically
  isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans, who were being
  conquered and displaced, those 13 colonies had a population of over 2.1 million
  in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate
  of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans
  had been born overseas.[83] The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the
  development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically
  seek to reassert royal authority.[84]\nIndependence and expansion (1776–1865)\nFurther
  information: American Revolutionary War, United States Declaration of Independence
  and American Revolution\n\n\n\n\nThe Declaration of Independence: the Committee
  of Five presenting their draft to the Second Continental Congress in 1776\n\n\nThe
  American Revolutionary War was the first successful colonial war of independence
  against a European power. Americans had developed an ideology of \"republicanism\"
  asserting that government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their
  local legislatures. They demanded their rights as Englishmen, \"no taxation without
  representation\". The British insisted on administering the empire through Parliament,
  and the conflict escalated into war.[85]\nFollowing the passage of the Lee Resolution,
  on July 2, 1776, which was the actual vote for independence, the Congress adopted
  the Declaration of Independence, on July 4, which proclaimed, in a long preamble,
  that humanity is created equal in their unalienable rights and that those rights
  were not being protected by Great Britain, and finally declared, in the words of
  the resolution, that the Thirteen Colonies were independent states and had no allegiance
  to the British crown in the United States. The fourth day of July is celebrated
  annually as Independence Day. In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established
  a weak government that operated until 1789.[86]\nBritain recognized the independence
  of the United States following their defeat at Yorktown.[87] In the peace treaty
  of 1783, American sovereignty was recognized from the Atlantic coast west to the
  Mississippi River. Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing
  the United States Constitution, ratified in state conventions in 1788. The federal
  government was reorganized into three branches, on the principle of creating salutary
  checks and balances, in 1789. George Washington, who had led the revolutionary army
  to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill
  of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing
  a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.[88]\nAlthough the federal government
  criminalized the international slave trade in 1808, after 1820 cultivation of the
  highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it the
  slave population.[89][90][91] The Second Great Awakening, beginning about 1800,
  converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North it energized multiple
  social reform movements, including abolitionism;[92] in the South, Methodists and
  Baptists proselytized among slave populations.[93]\nAmericans' eagerness to expand
  westward prompted a long series of American Indian Wars.[94] The Louisiana Purchase
  of French-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nation's size.[95] The War
  of 1812, declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw,
  strengthened U.S. nationalism.[96] A series of U.S. military incursions into Florida
  led Spain to cede it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[97] Expansion was aided
  by steam power, when steamboats began traveling along America's large water systems,
  which were connected by new canals, such as the Erie and the I&M; then, even faster
  railroads began their stretch across the nation's land.[98]\n\n\n\n\nU.S. territorial
  acquisitions–portions of each territory were granted statehood since the 18th century.\n\n\nFrom
  1820 to 1850, Jacksonian democracy began a set of reforms which included wider male
  suffrage; it led to the rise of the Second Party System of Democrats and Whigs as
  the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854. The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified
  the Indian removal policy that moved Indians into the west to their own reservations.
  The U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest
  destiny.[99] The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day
  American Northwest.[100] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848
  Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.[101]\nThe
  California Gold Rush of 1848–49 spurred western migration and the creation of additional
  western states.[102] After the American Civil War, new transcontinental railways
  made relocation easier for settlers, expanded internal trade and increased conflicts
  with Native Americans.[103] Over a half-century, the loss of the American bison
  (sometimes called \"buffalo\") was an existential blow to many Plains Indians cultures.[104]
  In 1869, a new Peace Policy sought to protect Native-Americans from abuses, avoid
  further war, and secure their eventual U.S. citizenship, although conflicts, including
  several of the largest Indian Wars, continued throughout the West into the 1900s.[105]\nCivil
  War and Reconstruction Era\nFurther information: American Civil War and Reconstruction
  Era\n\n\n\n\nThe Battle of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania during the Civil War by Thure
  de Thulstrup.\n\n\nDifferences of opinion and social order between northern and
  southern states in early United States society, particularly regarding Black slavery,
  ultimately led the U.S. into the American Civil War.[106] Initially, states entering
  the Union alternated between slave and free states, keeping a sectional balance
  in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the
  House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil
  states, tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism
  and disposition of the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.[107]\nWith
  the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln, the first president from the largely anti-slavery
  Republican Party, conventions in thirteen states ultimately declared secession and
  formed the Confederate States of America, while the U.S. federal government maintained
  that secession was illegal.[107] The ensuing war was at first for Union, then after
  1863 as casualties mounted and Lincoln delivered his Emancipation Proclamation,
  a second war aim became abolition of slavery. The war remains the deadliest military
  conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers
  as well as many civilians.[108]\nFollowing the Union victory in 1865, three amendments
  to the U.S. Constitution brought about the prohibition of slavery, gave U.S. citizenship
  to the nearly four million African Americans who had been slaves,[109] and promised
  them voting rights. The war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in
  federal power[110] aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the Southern states while
  ensuring the rights of the newly freed slaves.[111] Following the Reconstruction
  Era, throughout the South Jim Crow laws soon effectively disenfranchised most blacks
  and some poor whites. Over the subsequent decades, in both the North and the South
  blacks and some whites faced systemic discrimination, including racial segregation
  and occasional vigilante violence, sparking national movements against these abuses.[111]\nIndustrialization\nMain
  articles: Economic History of the United States and Technological and industrial
  history of the United States\n\n\n\n\nEllis Island in New York City was a major
  gateway for European immigration.\n\n\nIn the North, urbanization and an unprecedented
  influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor
  for the country's industrialization and transformed its culture.[112] National infrastructure
  including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater
  settlement and development of the American Old West. The later invention of electric
  light and the telephone would also impact communication and urban life.[113]\nThe
  end of the Indian Wars further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation, increasing
  surpluses for international markets.[114] Mainland expansion was completed by the
  purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.[115] In 1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii
  overthrew the monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii, which the U.S. annexed
  in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same
  year, following the Spanish–American War.[116]\nRapid economic development at the
  end of the 19th century produced many prominent industrialists, and the U.S. economy
  became the world's largest.[117] Dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest
  and the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[118] This period eventually
  ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms in many
  societal areas, including women's suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer
  goods, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker
  conditions.\nWorld War I, Great Depression, and World War II\nFurther information:
  World War I, Great Depression and World War II\n\n\n\n\nU.S. troops approaching
  Omaha Beach in 1944.\n\n\nThe United States remained neutral from the outbreak of
  World War I, in 1914, until 1917 when it joined the war as an \"associated power\",
  alongside the formal Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the
  Central Powers. In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role
  at the Paris Peace Conference and advocated strongly for the U.S. to join the League
  of Nations. However, the Senate refused to approve this, and did not ratify the
  Treaty of Versailles that established the League of Nations.[119]\nIn 1920, the
  women's rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment granting women's
  suffrage.[120] The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication
  and the invention of early television.[121] The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties
  ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression.
  After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the
  New Deal, which included the establishment of the Social Security system.[122] The
  Great Migration of millions of African Americans out of the American South began
  around WWI and extended through the 1960s;[123] whereas the Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s
  impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.[124]\nThe
  United States was at first effectively neutral during World War II's early stages
  but began supplying material to the Allies in March 1941 through the Lend-Lease
  program. On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack on
  Pearl Harbor, prompting the United States to join the Allies against the Axis powers.[125]
  During the war, the United States was referred as one of the \"Four Policemen\"[126]
  of Allies power who met to plan the post-war world, along with Britain, the Soviet
  Union and China.[127][128] Though the nation lost more than 400,000 soldiers,[129]
  it emerged relatively undamaged from the war with even greater economic and military
  influence.[130]\nAllied conferences at Bretton Woods and Yalta outlined a new system
  of international organizations that placed the United States and Soviet Union at
  the center of world affairs. As an Allied victory was won in Europe, a 1945 international
  conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became
  active after the war.[131] The United States developed the first nuclear weapons
  and used them on Japan; the Japanese surrendered on September 2, ending World War
  II.[132]\nCold War and civil rights era\nMain articles: History of the United States
  (1945–64), History of the United States (1964–80) and History of the United States
  (1980–91)\n\n\n\n\nU.S. President Ronald Reagan (left) and Soviet General Secretary
  Mikhail Gorbachev, meeting in Geneva in 1985\n\n\nAfter World War II the United
  States and the Soviet Union jockeyed for power during what is known as the Cold
  War, driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism[133] and,
  according to the school of geopolitics, a divide between the maritime Atlantic and
  the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with
  the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies
  on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of
  communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed
  powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.\nThe
  U.S. often opposed Third World movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored. American
  troops fought communist Chinese and North Korean forces in the Korean War of 1950–53.[134]
  The Soviet Union's 1957 launch of the first artificial satellite and its 1961 launch
  of the first manned spaceflight initiated a \"Space Race\" in which the United States
  became the first nation to land a man on the moon in 1969.[134] A proxy war in Southeast
  Asia eventually evolved into full American participation, as the Vietnam War.[fn
  4]\nAt home, the U.S. experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid growth
  of its population and middle class. Construction of an Interstate Highway System
  transformed the nation's infrastructure over the following decades. Millions moved
  from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments.[141][142] In
  1959 Hawaii became the 50th and last state added to the US.[143] A growing civil
  rights movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination, with
  Martin Luther King, Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead. A combination
  of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
  sought to end racial discrimination.[144][145][146] Meanwhile, a counterculture
  movement grew which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war, black nationalism,
  and the sexual revolution. The launch of a \"War on Poverty\" expanded entitlement
  and welfare spending.[147]\nThe 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation.
  After his election in 1980, President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation
  with free-market oriented reforms. Following the collapse of détente, he abandoned
  \"containment\" and initiated the more aggressive \"rollback\" strategy towards
  the USSR.[148][149][150][151][152] After a surge in female labor participation over
  the previous decade, by 1985 the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[153]\nThe
  late 1980s brought a \"thaw\" in relations with the USSR, and its collapse in 1991
  finally ended the Cold War.[154][155][156][157] This brought about unipolarity[158]
  with the U.S. unchallenged as the world's dominant superpower. The concept of Pax
  Americana, which had appeared in the post-World War II period, gained wide popularity
  as a term for the post-Cold War new world order.\nContemporary history\n\n\n\n\nThe

  the Internet spread to international academic networks, and then to the public in
  the 1990s, greatly impacting the global economy, society, and culture.[160] On September
  11, 2001, Al-Qaeda terrorists struck the World Trade Center in New York City and
  the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people.[161] In response,
  the United States launched the War on Terror, which includes the ongoing war in
  Afghanistan and the 2003–11 Iraq War.[162][163]\nBeginning in 1994, the U.S. entered
  into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), linking 450 million people
  producing $17 trillion worth of goods and services. The goal of the agreement was
  to eliminate trade and investment barriers among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico by
  January 1, 2008; trade among the partners has soared since the agreement went into
  force.[164]\nBarack Obama, the first African American,[165] and multiracial[166]

  to 3,794,101 square miles (9.8 Mm2)[5] to 3,805,927 square miles (9.9 Mm2).[18]
  Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and
  China, just ahead of Canada.[172]\nThe coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives

  size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. To the east of the 100th
  meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical
  in the south.[181] The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much
  of the Western mountains have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Great
  Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic
  in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic
  or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as are the populated
  territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[182] Extreme weather is not uncommon—the
  states bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's
  tornadoes occur within the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest
  and South.[183]\nWildlife\nMain articles: Fauna of the United States and Flora of
  the United States\n\n\n\n\nThe bald eagle has been the national bird of the United
  States since 1782.\n\n\nThe U.S. ecology is megadiverse: about 17,000 species of
  vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1,800
  species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[184]
  The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 bird species, 311 reptile species,
  and 295 amphibian species.[185] About 91,000 insect species have been described.[186]
  The bald eagle is both the national bird and national animal of the United States,
  and is an enduring symbol of the country itself.[187]\nThere are 58 national parks
  and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas.[188]
  Altogether, the government owns about 28% of the country's land area.[189] Most
  of this is protected, though some is leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging,
  or cattle ranching; about .86% is used for military purposes.[190][191]\nEnvironmental
  issues have been on the national agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies
  include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution,
  the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation,[192][193]
  and international responses to global warming.[194][195] Many federal and state
  agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency
  (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970.[196] The idea of wilderness has shaped
  the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[197] The Endangered
  Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and
  their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.[198]\nDemographics\nMain

  U.S. Census Bureau currently estimates the country's population to be 322,431,000.[200]
  The U.S. population almost quadrupled during the 20th century, from about 76 million
  in 1900.[201] The third most populous nation in the world, after China and India,
  the United States is the only major industrialized nation in which large population
  increases are projected.[202] In the 1800s the average woman had 7.04 children,
  by the 1900s this number had decreased to 3.56.[203] Since the early 1970s the birth
  rate has been below the replacement rate of 2.1 with 1.86 children per woman in
  2014. Foreign born immigration has caused the US population to continue its rapid
  increase with the foreign born population doubling from almost 20 million in 1990
  to over 40 million in 2010, representing one third of the population increase.[204]
  The foreign born population reached 45 million in 2015.[205]\nThe United States
  has a very diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members.[206]German
  Americans are the largest ethnic group (more than 50 million) – followed by Irish
  Americans (circa 37 million), Mexican Americans (circa 31 million) and English Americans
  (circa 28 million).[207][208]\nWhite Americans are the largest racial group; Black
  Americans are the nation's largest racial minority (note that in the U.S. Census,
  Hispanic and Latino Americans are counted as an ethnic group, not a racial group),
  and third largest ancestry group.[206]Asian Americans are the country's second largest
  racial minority; the three largest Asian American ethnic groups are Chinese Americans,
  Filipino Americans, and Indian Americans.[206]\nThe United States has a birth rate
  of 13 per 1,000, which is 5 births below the world average.[209] Its population
  growth rate is positive at 0.7%, higher than that of many developed nations.[210]
  In fiscal year 2012, over one million immigrants (most of whom entered through family
  reunification) were granted legal residence.[211]Mexico has been the leading source
  of new residents since the 1965 Immigration Act. China, India, and the Philippines
  have been in the top four sending countries every year since the 1990s.[212] As
  of 2012[update], approximately 11.4 million residents are illegal immigrants.[213]
  As of 2015, 47% of all immigrants are Hispanic, 26% are Asian, 18% are white and
  8% are black. The percentage of immigrants who are Asian is increasing while the
  percentage who are Hispanic is decreasing.[205]\nAccording to a survey conducted
  by the Williams Institute, nine million Americans, or roughly 3.4% of the adult
  population identify themselves as homosexual, bisexual, or transgender.[214][215]
  A 2012 Gallup poll also concluded that 3.5% of adult Americans identified as LGBT.
  The highest percentage came from the District of Columbia (10%), while the lowest
  state was North Dakota at 1.7%.[216] In a 2013 survey, the Centers for Disease Control
  and Prevention found that 96.6% of Americans identify as straight, while 1.6% identify
  as gay or lesbian, and 0.7% identify as being bisexual.[217]\nIn 2010, the U.S.
  population included an estimated 5.2 million people with some American Indian or
  Alaska Native ancestry (2.9 million exclusively of such ancestry) and 1.2 million
  with some native Hawaiian or Pacific island ancestry (0.5 million exclusively).[218]
  The census counted more than 19 million people of \"Some Other Race\" who were \"unable
  to identify with any\" of its five official race categories in 2010.[218]\nThe population
  growth of Hispanic and Latino Americans (the terms are officially interchangeable)
  is a major demographic trend. The 50.5 million Americans of Hispanic descent[218]
  are identified as sharing a distinct \"ethnicity\" by the Census Bureau; 64% of
  Hispanic Americans are of Mexican descent.[219] Between 2000 and 2010, the country's
  Hispanic population increased 43% while the non-Hispanic population rose just 4.9%.[220]
  Much of this growth is from immigration; in 2007, 12.6% of the U.S. population was
  foreign-born, with 54% of that figure born in Latin America.[221]\nFertility is
  also a factor; in 2010 the average Hispanic woman gave birth to 2.35 children in
  her lifetime, compared to 1.97 for non-Hispanic black women and 1.79 for non-Hispanic
  white women (both below the replacement rate of 2.1).[222]Minorities (as defined
  by the Census Bureau as all those beside non-Hispanic, non-multiracial whites) constituted
  36.3% of the population in 2010 (this is nearly 40% in 2015),[223] and over 50%
  of children under age one,[224] and are projected to constitute the majority by
  2042.[225] This contradicts the report by the National Vital Statistics Reports,
  based on the U.S. census data, which concludes that 54% (2,162,406 out of 3,999,386
  in 2010) of births were non-Hispanic white.[222] The Hispanic birth rate plummeted
  25% between 2006 and 2013 while the rate for non-Hispanics decreased just 5%.[226]\nAbout
  82% of Americans live in urban areas (including suburbs);[5] about half of those
  reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[227] The US has numerous clusters
  of cities known as megaregions, the largest being the Great Lakes Megalopolis followed
  by the Northeast Megalopolis and Southern California. In 2008, 273 incorporated
  places had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents,
  and four global cities had over two million (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago,
  and Houston).[228] There are 52 metropolitan areas with populations greater than
  one million.[229] Of the 50 fastest-growing metro areas, 47 are in the West or South.[230]
  The metro areas of San Bernardino, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and Phoenix all grew
  by more than a million people between 2000 and 2008.[229]\n\n\nLanguage\nLanguages

  Language education in the United States\nEnglish (American English) is the de facto
  national language. Although there is no official language at the federal level,
  some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2010,
  about 230 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only
  English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second
  most common language and the most widely taught second language.[232][233] Some
  Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in 28
  states.[13]\nBoth Hawaiian and English are official languages in Hawaii, by state
  law.[234] Alaska recognizes twenty Native languages.[235] While neither has an official
  language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish,
  as Louisiana does for English and French.[236] Other states, such as California,
  mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents including
  court forms.[237] Many jurisdictions with large numbers of non-English speakers
  produce government materials, especially voting information, in the most commonly
  spoken languages in those jurisdictions.\nSeveral insular territories grant official
  recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan[238] and Chamorro[239]
  are recognized by American Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro
  are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands;[240]Cherokee is officially recognized
  by the Cherokee Nation within the Cherokee tribal jurisdiction area in eastern Oklahoma;[241]
  Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico and is more widely spoken than English
  there.[242]\nAccording to the Center for Immigration Studies, Arabic and Urdu (Pakistan's
  national language) are the fastest growing foreign languages spoken at American
  households. According to the survey, more than 63.2 million US residents speak a
  language other than English at home. In recent years, Arabic speaking residents
  increased by 29%, Urdu by 23% and Persian by 9%.[243]\nThe most widely taught foreign
  languages at all levels in the United States (in terms of enrollment numbers) are:
  Spanish (around 7.2 million students), French (1.5 million), and German (500,000).
  Other commonly taught languages (with 100,000 to 250,000 learners) include Latin,
  Japanese, American Sign Language, Italian, and Chinese.[244][245] 18% of all Americans
  claim to speak at least one language in addition to English.[246]\n\nReligion\nReligious

  of religion in the United States, Separation of church and state in the United States
  and List of religious movements that began in the United States\nThe First Amendment
  of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress
  from passing laws respecting its establishment. Christianity is by far the most
  common religion practiced in the U.S., but other religions are followed, too. In
  a 2013 survey, 56% of Americans said that religion played a \"very important role
  in their lives\", a far higher figure than that of any other wealthy nation.[248]
  In a 2009 Gallup poll 42% of Americans said that they attended church weekly or
  almost weekly; the figures ranged from a low of 23% in Vermont to a high of 63%
  in Mississippi.[249]\nAs with other Western countries, the U.S. is becoming less
  religious. Irreligion is growing rapidly among Americans under 30.[250] Polls show
  that overall American confidence in organized religion is declining,[251] and that
  younger Americans in particular are becoming increasingly irreligious.[247][252]
  According to a 2012 study, Protestant share of U.S. population dropped to 48%, thus
  ending its status as religious category of the majority for the first time.[253][254][255]
  Americans with no religion have 1.7 children compared to 2.2 among Christians. The
  unaffiliated are less likely to get married with 37% marrying compared to 52% of
  Christians.[256]\nAccording to a 2014 survey, 70.6% of adults identified themselves
  as Christian,[257]Protestant denominations accounted for 46.5%, while Roman Catholicism,
  at 20.8%, was the largest individual denomination.[258] The total reporting non-Christian
  religions in 2014 was 5.9%.[258] Other religions include Judaism (1.9%), Islam (0.9%),
  Buddhism (0.7%), Hinduism (0.7%).[258] The survey also reported that 22.8% of Americans
  described themselves as agnostic, atheist or simply having no religion, up from
  8.2% in 1990.[258][259][260] There are also Unitarian Universalist, Baha'i, Sikh,
  Jain, Shinto, Confucian, Taoist, Druid, Native American, Wiccan, humanist and deist
  communities.[261]\nProtestantism is the largest Christian religious grouping in
  the United States. Baptists collectively form the largest branch of Protestantism,
  and the Southern Baptist Convention is the largest individual Protestant denomination.
  About 26% of Americans identify as Evangelical Protestants, while 15% are Mainline
  and 7% belong to a traditionally Black church. Roman Catholicism in the United States
  has its origin in the Spanish and French colonization of the Americas, and later
  grew because of Irish, Italian, Polish, German and Hispanic immigration. Rhode Island
  is the only state where a majority of the population is Catholic. Lutheranism in
  the U.S. has its origin in immigration from Northern Europe and Germany. North and
  South Dakota are the only states in which a plurality of the population is Lutheran.
  Presbyterianism was introduced in North America by Scottish and Ulster Scots immigrants.
  Although it has spread across the United States, it is heavily concentrated on the
  East Coast. Dutch Reformed congregations were founded first in New Amsterdam (New
  York City) before spreading westward. Utah is the only state where Mormonism is
  the religion of the majority of the population. The Mormon Corridor also extends
  to parts of Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming.[262]\nThe Bible Belt is an informal term
  for a region in the Southern United States in which socially conservative Evangelical
  Protestantism is a significant part of the culture and Christian church attendance
  across the denominations is generally higher than the nation's average. By contrast,
  religion plays the least important role in New England and in the Western United
  States.[249]\nFamily structure\nMain article: Family structure in the United States\nSee
  also: Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States, Same-sex marriage in the United
  States and Cousin marriage law in the United States by state\nAs of 2007[update],
  58% of Americans age 18 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced,
  and 25% had never been married.[263] Women now work mostly outside the home and
  receive a majority of bachelor's degrees.[264]\nThe U.S. teenage pregnancy rate
  is 26.5 per 1,000 women. The rate has declined by 57% since 1991.[265] In 2013,
  the highest teenage birth rate was in Alabama, and the lowest in Wyoming.[265][266]Abortion
  is legal throughout the U.S., owing to Roe v. Wade, a 1973 landmark decision by
  the Supreme Court of the United States. While the abortion rate is falling, the
  abortion ratio of 241 per 1,000 live births and abortion rate of 15 per 1,000 women
  aged 15–44 remain higher than those of most Western nations.[267] In 2013, the average
  age at first birth was 26 and 40.6% of births were to unmarried women.[268]\nThe
  total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated for 2013 at 1.86 births per woman.[269]Adoption
  in the United States is common and relatively easy from a legal point of view (compared
  to other Western countries).[270] In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the U.S.
  accounted for nearly half of the total number of adoptions worldwide.[271] It is
  legal for same-sex couples to adopt. Polygamy is illegal throughout the U.S.[272]\nGovernment

  is the world's oldest surviving federation. It is a constitutional republic and
  representative democracy, \"in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights
  protected by law\".[273] The government is regulated by a system of checks and balances
  defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal document.[274]
  For 2014, the U.S. ranked 19th on the Democracy Index[275] and 17th on the Corruption
  Perceptions Index.[276]\nIn the American federalist system, citizens are usually
  subject to three levels of government: federal, state, and local. The local government's
  duties are commonly split between county and municipal governments. In almost all
  cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of citizens
  by district. There is no proportional representation at the federal level, and it
  is rare at lower levels.[277]\n\n\n\n\nThe political system of the United States\n\n\nThe
  federal government is composed of three branches:\nLegislative: The bicameral Congress,
  made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares
  war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse,[278] and has the power of impeachment,
  by which it can remove sitting members of the government.[279]\nExecutive: The President
  is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they
  become law (subject to Congressional override), and appoints the members of the
  Cabinet (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce
  federal laws and policies.[280]\nJudicial: The Supreme Court and lower federal courts,
  whose judges are appointed by the President with Senate approval, interpret laws
  and overturn those they find unconstitutional.[281]\nThe House of Representatives
  has 435 voting members, each representing a congressional district for a two-year
  term. House seats are apportioned among the states by population every tenth year.
  At the 2010 census, seven states had the minimum of one representative, while California,
  the most populous state, had 53.[282]\nThe Senate has 100 members with each state
  having two senators, elected at-large to six-year terms; one third of Senate seats
  are up for election every other year. The President serves a four-year term and
  may be elected to the office no more than twice. The President is not elected by
  direct vote, but by an indirect electoral college system in which the determining
  votes are apportioned to the states and the District of Columbia.[283] The Supreme
  Court, led by the Chief Justice of the United States, has nine members, who serve
  for life.[284]\nThe state governments are structured in roughly similar fashion;
  Nebraska uniquely has a unicameral legislature.[285] The governor (chief executive)
  of each state is directly elected. Some state judges and cabinet officers are appointed
  by the governors of the respective states, while others are elected by popular vote.\nThe
  original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities
  of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states. Article
  One protects the right to the \"great writ\" of habeas corpus. The Constitution
  has been amended 27 times;[286] the first ten amendments, which make up the Bill
  of Rights, and the Fourteenth Amendment form the central basis of Americans' individual
  rights. All laws and governmental procedures are subject to judicial review and
  any law ruled by the courts to be in violation of the Constitution is voided. The
  principle of judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was
  established by the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison (1803)[287] in a decision
  handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall.[288]\nPolitical divisions\nMain articles:

  of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and eleven uninhabited island
  possessions.[290] The states and territories are the principal administrative districts
  in the country. These are divided into subdivisions of counties and independent
  cities. The District of Columbia is a federal district which contains the capital
  of the United States, Washington DC.[291] The states and the District of Columbia
  choose the President of the United States. Each state has presidential electors
  equal to the number of their Representatives and Senators in Congress, the District
  of Columbia has three.[292]\nCongressional Districts are reapportioned among the
  states following each decennial Census of Population. Each state then draws single
  member districts to conform with the census apportionment. The total number of Representatives
  is 435, and delegate Members of Congress represent the District of Columbia and
  the five major US territories.[293]\nThe United States also observes tribal sovereignty
  of the Native American nations. Though reservations are within state borders, the
  reservation is a sovereign entity. While the United States recognizes this sovereignty,
  other countries may not.[294]\nParties and elections\nMain articles: Politics of
  the United States and Political ideologies in the United States\n\n\n\n\nPresident
  Obama meets with congressional leadership in 2011.\n\n\nThe United States has operated
  under a two-party system for most of its history.[295] For elective offices at most
  levels, state-administered primary elections choose the major party nominees for
  subsequent general elections. Since the general election of 1856, the major parties
  have been the Democratic Party, founded in 1824, and the Republican Party, founded
  in 1854. Since the Civil War, only one third-party presidential candidate—former
  president Theodore Roosevelt, running as a Progressive in 1912—has won as much as
  20% of the popular vote. The third-largest political party is the Libertarian Party.
  The President and Vice-president are elected through the Electoral College system.[296]\nWithin
  American political culture, the Republican Party is considered \"conservative\"
  and the Democratic Party is considered \"liberal\".[297][disputed – discuss] The
  states of the Northeast and West Coast and some of the Great Lakes states, known
  as \"blue states\", are relatively liberal. The \"red states\" of the South and
  parts of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains are relatively conservative.\nThe
  winner of the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, Democrat Barack Obama, is the
  44th, and current, U.S. president. Current leadership in the Senate includes Democratic
  Vice President Joseph Biden, Republican President Pro Tempore (Pro Tem) Orrin Hatch,
  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Minority Leader Harry Reid.[298] Leadership
  in the House includes Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy,
  and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.[299]\nIn the 114th United States Congress, both
  the House of Representatives and the Senate are controlled by the Republican Party.
  The Senate currently consists of 54 Republicans, and 44 Democrats with two independents
  who caucus with the Democrats; the House consists of 246 Republicans and 188 Democrats,
  with one vacancy.[300] In state governorships, there are 31 Republicans, 18 Democrats
  and one independent.[301] Among the DC mayor and the 5 territorial governors, there
  are 2 Republicans, 2 Democrats (one is also in the PPD), and 2 Independents.[302]\nForeign

  New York City is home to the United Nations Headquarters. It is a member of the
  G7,[303]G20, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Almost
  all countries have embassies in Washington, D.C., and many have consulates around
  the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host American diplomatic missions. However,
  Iran, North Korea, Bhutan, and the Republic of China (Taiwan) do not have formal
  diplomatic relations with the United States (although the U.S. still maintains relations

  Zealand,[308]the Philippines,[309]Japan,[310]South Korea,[311]Israel,[312] and several
  European Union countries, including France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. It works
  closely with fellow NATO members on military and security issues and with its neighbors
  through the Organization of American States and free trade agreements such as the
  trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. In 2008,
  the United States spent a net $25.4 billion on official development assistance,
  the most in the world. As a share of America's large gross national income (GNI),
  however, the U.S. contribution of 0.18% ranked last among 22 donor states. By contrast,
  private overseas giving by Americans is relatively generous.[313]\nThe U.S. exercises
  full international defense authority and responsibility for three sovereign nations
  through Compact of Free Association with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau,
  all of which are Pacific island nations which were part of the U.S.-administered
  Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands beginning after World War II, and gained
  independence in subsequent years.[314]\nGovernment finance\nSee also: Taxation in
  the United States and United States federal budget\nTaxes are levied in the United
  States at the federal, state and local government level. These include taxes on
  income, payroll, property, sales, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various
  fees. In 2010 taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted
  to 24.8% of GDP.[315] During FY2012, the federal government collected approximately
  $2.45 trillion in tax revenue, up $147 billion or 6% versus FY2011 revenues of $2.30
  trillion. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,132B or
  47%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($845B or 35%), and corporate taxes
  ($242B or 10%).[316] Based on CBO Estimates,[317] under 2013 tax law the top 1%
  will be paying the highest average tax rates since 1979, while other income groups
  will remain at historic lows.[318]\nU.S. taxation is generally progressive, especially
  the federal income taxes, and is among the most progressive in the developed world.[319][320][321][322][323]
  The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes,[324] and about
  half of all taxes.[325] Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive
  tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax
  at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains.[326][327]
  The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement
  programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers.[328][329] However, according
  to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the
  benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about
  170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.[330]\nThe top
  10% paid 51.8% of total federal taxes in 2009, and the top 1%, with 13.4% of pre-tax
  national income, paid 22.3% of federal taxes.[331] In 2013 the Tax Policy Center
  projected total federal effective tax rates of 35.5% for the top 1%, 27.2% for the
  top quintile, 13.8% for the middle quintile, and −2.7% for the bottom quintile.[332][333]
  The incidence of corporate income tax has been a matter of considerable ongoing
  controversy for decades.[322][334] State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally
  less progressive than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive
  sales and property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams, though their
  consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.[322][335]\nDuring
  FY 2012, the federal government spent $3.54 trillion on a budget or cash basis,
  down $60 billion or 1.7% vs. FY 2011 spending of $3.60 trillion. Major categories
  of FY 2012 spending included: Medicare & Medicaid ($802B or 23% of spending), Social
  Security ($768B or 22%), Defense Department ($670B or 19%), non-defense discretionary
  ($615B or 17%), other mandatory ($461B or 13%) and interest ($223B or 6%).[316]\nNational
  debt\nMain article: National debt of the United States\n\n\n\n\nUS federal debt
  held by the public as a percentage of GDP, from 1790 to 2013\n\n\nThe total national
  debt in the United States was $18.527 trillion (106% of the GDP), according to an
  estimate for 2014 by the International Monetary Fund.[336] In January 2015, U.S.
  federal government debt held by the public was approximately $13 trillion, or about
  72% of U.S. GDP. Intra-governmental holdings stood at $5 trillion, giving a combined
  total debt of $18.080 trillion.[337][338] By 2012, total federal debt had surpassed
  100% of U.S. GDP.[339] The U.S. has a credit rating of AA+ from Standard & Poor's,
  AAA from Fitch, and AAA from Moody's.[340]\nHistorically, the U.S. public debt as
  a share of GDP increased during wars and recessions, and subsequently declined.
  For example, debt held by the public as a share of GDP peaked just after World War
  II (113% of GDP in 1945), but then fell over the following 30 years. In recent decades,
  large budget deficits and the resulting increases in debt have led to concern about
  the long-term sustainability of the federal government's fiscal policies.[341] However,
  these concerns are not universally shared.[342]\nMilitary\nMain article: United

  holds the title of commander-in-chief of the nation's armed forces and appoints
  its leaders, the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The United
  States Department of Defense administers the armed forces, including the Army, Navy,
  Marine Corps, and Air Force. The Coast Guard is run by the Department of Homeland
  Security in peacetime and by the Department of the Navy during times of war. In
  2008, the armed forces had 1.4 million personnel on active duty. The Reserves and
  National Guard brought the total number of troops to 2.3 million. The Department
  of Defense also employed about 700,000 civilians, not including contractors.[343]\nMilitary
  service is voluntary, though conscription may occur in wartime through the Selective
  Service System.[344] American forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Force's
  large fleet of transport aircraft, the Navy's 10 active aircraft carriers, and Marine
  expeditionary units at sea with the Navy's Atlantic and Pacific fleets. The military
  operates 865 bases and facilities abroad,[345] and maintains deployments greater
  than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.[346]\nThe military budget
  of the United States in 2011 was more than $700 billion, 41% of global military
  spending and equal to the next 14 largest national military expenditures combined.
  At 4.7% of GDP, the rate was the second-highest among the top 15 military spenders,
  after Saudi Arabia.[347] U.S. defense spending as a percentage of GDP ranked 23rd
  globally in 2012 according to the CIA.[348] Defense's share of U.S. spending has
  generally declined in recent decades, from Cold War peaks of 14.2% of GDP in 1953
  and 69.5% of federal outlays in 1954 to 4.7% of GDP and 18.8% of federal outlays
  in 2011.[349]\nThe proposed base Department of Defense budget for 2012, $553 billion,
  was a 4.2% increase over 2011; an additional $118 billion was proposed for the military
  campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.[350] The last American troops serving in Iraq
  departed in December 2011;[351] 4,484 service members were killed during the Iraq
  War.[352] Approximately 90,000 U.S. troops were serving in Afghanistan in April
  2012;[353] by November 8, 2013 2,285 had been killed during the War in Afghanistan.[354]\nLaw
  enforcement and crime\nMain articles: Law enforcement in the United States and Crime
  in the United States\nSee also: Law of the United States, Second Amendment to the
  United States Constitution, Human rights in the United States § Justice system,
  Incarceration in the United States and Capital punishment in the United States\n\n\n\n\nLaw
  enforcement in the U.S. is maintained primarily by local police departments.[355]\n\n\nLaw
  enforcement in the United States is primarily the responsibility of local police
  and sheriff's departments, with state police providing broader services. The New
  York City Police Department (NYPD) is the largest in the country. Federal agencies
  such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service
  have specialized duties, including protecting civil rights, national security and
  enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws.[356] At the federal level
  and in almost every state, a legal system operates on a common law. State courts
  conduct most criminal trials; federal courts handle certain designated crimes as
  well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. Plea bargaining in the United
  States is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled
  by plea bargain rather than jury trial.[357]\nIn 2012 there were 4.7 murders per
  100,000 persons in the United States, a 54% decline from the modern peak of 10.2
  in 1980.[358] In 2001–2, the United States had above-average levels of violent crime
  and particularly high levels of gun violence compared to other developed nations.[359]
  A cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from
  2003 showed that United States \"homicide rates were 6.9 times higher than rates
  in the other high-income countries, driven by firearm homicide rates that were 19.5
  times higher.\"[360][dated info]Gun ownership rights continue to be the subject
  of contentious political debate.\nFrom 1980 through 2008 males represented 77% of
  homicide victims and 90% of offenders. Blacks committed 52.5% of all homicides during
  that span, at a rate almost eight times that of whites (\"whites\" includes most
  Hispanics), and were victimized at a rate six times that of whites. Most homicides
  were intraracial, with 93% of black victims killed by blacks and 84% of white victims
  killed by whites.[361] In 2012, Louisiana had the highest rate of murder and non-negligent
  manslaughter in the U.S., and New Hampshire the lowest.[362] The FBI's Uniform Crime
  Reports estimates that there were 3,246 violent and property crimes per 100,000
  residents in 2012, for a total of over 9 million total crimes.[363]\nCapital punishment
  is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and
  used in 31 states.[364][365] No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in
  part to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the death
  penalty. In 1976, that Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital
  punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there have been more
  than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas,
  Virginia, and Oklahoma.[366] Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or
  struck down death penalty laws. In 2014, the country had the fifth highest number
  of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq.[367]\nThe
  United States has the highest documented incarceration rate and total prison population
  in the world.[368] At the start of 2008, more than 2.3 million people were incarcerated,
  more than one in every 100 adults.[369] At year end 2012, the combined U.S. adult
  correctional systems supervised about 6,937,600 offenders. About 1 in every 35 adult
  residents in the United States was under some form of correctional supervision at
  yearend 2012, the lowest rate observed since 1997.[370] The prison population has
  quadrupled since 1980.[371] However, the imprisonment rate for all prisoners sentenced
  to more than a year in state or federal facilities is 478 per 100,000 in 2013[372]
  and the rate for pre-trial/remand prisoners is 153 per 100,000 residents in 2012.[373]
  The country's high rate of incarceration is largely due to changes in sentencing
  guidelines and drug policies.[374] According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the
  majority of inmates held in federal prisons are convicted of drug offenses.[375]
  The privatization of prisons and prison services which began in the 1980s has been
  a subject of debate.[376][377] In 2008, Louisiana had the highest incarceration
  rate,[378] and Maine the lowest.[379]\nEconomy\nMain article: Economy of the United

  United States has a capitalist mixed economy which is fueled by abundant natural
  resources and high productivity.[388] According to the International Monetary Fund,
  the U.S. GDP of $16.8 trillion constitutes 24% of the gross world product at market
  exchange rates and over 19% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity
  (PPP).[389]\nThe US's nominal GDP is estimated to be $17.528 trillion as of 2014[update][390]
  From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to
  a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the G7.[391] The country ranks ninth in
  the world in nominal GDP per capita and sixth in GDP per capita at PPP.[389] The
  U.S. dollar is the world's primary reserve currency.[392]\nThe United States is
  the largest importer of goods and second largest exporter, though exports per capita
  are relatively low. In 2010, the total U.S. trade deficit was $635 billion.[393]
  Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, and Germany are its top trading partners.[394] In
  2010, oil was the largest import commodity, while transportation equipment was the
  country's largest export.[393] Japan is the largest foreign holder of U.S. public
  debt.[395] The largest holder of the U.S. debt are American entities, including
  federal government accounts and the Federal Reserve, who hold the majority of the
  debt.[396][397][398][399]\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute,
  SIPRI, found that the United States' arms industry was the world's biggest exporter
  of major weapons from 2005–2009,[400] and remained the largest exporter of major
  weapons during a period between 2010–2014, followed by Russia, China (PRC), and
  Germany.[401]\nIn 2009, the private sector was estimated to constitute 86.4% of
  the economy, with federal government activity accounting for 4.3% and state and
  local government activity (including federal transfers) the remaining 9.3%.[402]
  The number of employees at all levels of government outnumber those in manufacturing
  by 1.7 to 1.[403] While its economy has reached a postindustrial level of development
  and its service sector constitutes 67.8% of GDP, the United States remains an industrial
  power.[404] The leading business field by gross business receipts is wholesale and
  retail trade; by net income it is manufacturing.[405] In the franchising business
  model, McDonald's and Subway are the two most recognized brands in the world. Coca-Cola
  is the most recognized soft drink company in the world.[406]\nChemical products
  are the leading manufacturing field.[407] The United States is the largest producer
  of oil in the world, as well as its second largest importer.[408] It is the world's
  number one producer of electrical and nuclear energy, as well as liquid natural
  gas, sulfur, phosphates, and salt. The National Mining Association provides data
  pertaining to coal and minerals that include beryllium, copper, lead, magnesium,
  zinc, titanium and others.[409][410]\nAgriculture accounts for just under 1% of
  GDP,[404] yet the United States is the world's top producer of corn[411] and soybeans.[412]
  The National Agricultural Statistics Service maintains agricultural statistics for
  products that include peanuts, oats, rye, wheat, rice, cotton, corn, barley, hay,
  sunflowers, and oilseeds. In addition, the United States Department of Agriculture
  (USDA) provides livestock statistics regarding beef, poultry, pork, and dairy products.
  The country is the primary developer and grower of genetically modified food, representing
  half of the world's biotech crops.[413]\nConsumer spending comprises 68% of the
  U.S. economy in 2015.[414] In August 2010, the American labor force consisted of
  154.1 million people. With 21.2 million people, government is the leading field
  of employment. The largest private employment sector is health care and social assistance,
  with 16.4 million people. About 12% of workers are unionized, compared to 30% in
  Western Europe.[415] The World Bank ranks the United States first in the ease of
  hiring and firing workers.[416] The United States is ranked among the top three
  in the Global Competitiveness Report as well. It has a smaller welfare state and
  redistributes less income through government action than European nations tend to.[417]\nThe
  United States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid
  vacation[418] and is one of just a few countries in the world without paid family
  leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia.[419]
  However, 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave, according to the
  Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers get the same
  benefits.[420] While federal law currently does not require sick leave, it's a common
  benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations.[420] In
  2009, the United States had the third highest workforce productivity per person
  in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. It was fourth in productivity per hour,
  behind those two countries and the Netherlands.[421]\nThe 2008–2012 global recession
  had a significant impact on the United States, with output still below potential
  according to the Congressional Budget Office.[422] It brought high unemployment
  (which has been decreasing but remains above pre-recession levels), along with low
  consumer confidence, the continuing decline in home values and increase in foreclosures
  and personal bankruptcies, an escalating federal debt crisis, inflation, and rising
  petroleum and food prices. There remains a record proportion of long-term unemployed,
  continued decreasing household income, and tax and federal budget increases.[423][424][425]\nIncome,

  highest average household and employee income among OECD nations, and in 2007 had
  the second highest median household income.[426][427] According to the Census Bureau
  real median household income was $50,502 in 2011, down from $51,144 in 2010.[428]
  The Global Food Security Index ranked the U.S. number one for food affordability
  and overall food security in March 2013.[429] Americans on average have over twice
  as much living space per dwelling and per person as European Union residents, and
  more than every EU nation.[430] For 2013 the United Nations Development Programme
  ranked the United States 5th among 187 countries in its Human Development Index
  and 28th in its inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI).[431]\nThere has been a widening
  gap between productivity and median incomes since the 1970s.[432] However, the gap
  between total compensation and productivity is not as wide because of increased
  employee benefits such as health insurance.[433] While inflation-adjusted (\"real\")
  household income had been increasing almost every year from 1947 to 1999, it has
  since been flat on balance and has even decreased recently.[434] According to Congressional
  Research Service, during this same period, immigration to the United States increased,
  while the lower 90% of tax filers incomes became stagnant, and eventually decreasing
  since 2000.[435] The rise in the share of total annual income received by the top
  1 percent, which has more than doubled from 9 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011,
  has had a significant impact on income inequality,[436] leaving the United States
  with one of the widest income distributions among OECD nations.[437] The post-recession
  income gains have been very uneven, with the top 1 percent capturing 95 percent
  of the income gains from 2009 to 2012.[438] The extent and relevance of income inequality
  is a matter of debate.[439][disputed – discuss][440]\nWealth, like income and taxes,
  is highly concentrated; the richest 10% of the adult population possess 72% of the
  country's household wealth, while the bottom half claim only 2%.[441] Between June
  2007 and November 2008 the global recession led to falling asset prices around the
  world. Assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value.[442] Since
  peaking in the second quarter of 2007, household wealth was down $14 trillion, but
  has since increased $14 trillion over 2006 levels.[443][444] At the end of 2014,
  household debt amounted to $11.8 trillion,[445] down from $13.8 trillion at the
  end of 2008.[446]\nThere were about 578,424 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons
  in the U.S. in January 2014, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter
  or transitional housing program.[447] In 2011 16.7 million children lived in food-insecure
  households, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 1.1% of U.S. children,
  or 845,000, saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns at some point during
  the year, and most cases were not chronic.[448] According to a 2014 report by the
  Census Bureau, one in five young adults lives in poverty today, up from one in seven
  in 1980.[449]\nEducation\nMain article: Education in the United States\n\n\n\n\nThe
  University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, is one of the many
  public universities in the United States.\n\n\nAmerican public education is operated
  by state and local governments, regulated by the United States Department of Education
  through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to
  attend school from the age of six or seven (generally, kindergarten or first grade)
  until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high
  school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[450]\nAbout 12%
  of children are enrolled in parochial or nonsectarian private schools. Just over
  2% of children are homeschooled.[451] The U.S. spends more on education per student
  than any nation in the world, spending more than $11,000 per elementary student
  in 2010 and more than $12,000 per high school student.[452] Some 80% of U.S. college
  students attend public universities.[453]\nThe United States has many competitive
  private and public institutions of higher education. The majority of world's top
  universities listed by different ranking organizations are in the US.[454][455][456]
  There are also local community colleges with generally more open admission policies,
  shorter academic programs, and lower tuition. Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated
  from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree,
  and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[457] The basic literacy rate is approximately
  99%.[5][458] The United Nations assigns the United States an Education Index of
  0.97, tying it for 12th in the world.[459]\nAs for public expenditures on higher
  education, the U.S. trails some other OECD nations but spends more per student than
  the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[452][460]
  As of 2012[update], student loan debt exceeded one trillion dollars, more than Americans
  owe on credit cards.[461]\nCulture\nMain article: Culture of the United States\nSee
  also: Alaska Natives § Cultures, Native American cultures in the United States,
  Culture of the Native Hawaiians, Social class in the United States, Public holidays
  in the United States and Tourism in the United States\nThe United States is home
  to many cultures and a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values.[26][462]
  Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations,
  nearly all Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five
  centuries.[463] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived
  from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources,
  such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[26][464] More recent immigration
  from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been
  described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl in
  which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.[26]\nCore
  American culture was established by Protestant British colonists and shaped by the
  frontier settlement process, with the traits derived passed down to descendants
  and transmitted to immigrants through assimilation. Americans have traditionally
  been characterized by a strong work ethic, competitiveness, and individualism, as
  well as a unifying belief in an \"American creed\" emphasizing liberty, equality,
  private property, democracy, rule of law, and a preference for limited government.[465]
  Americans are extremely charitable by global standards. According to a 2006 British
  study, Americans gave 1.67% of GDP to charity, more than any other nation studied,
  more than twice the second place British figure of 0.73%, and around twelve times
  the French figure of 0.14%.[466][467]\nThe American Dream, or the perception that
  Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[468]
  Whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate.[469][470][471][472][391][473]
  While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[474]
  scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes,
  affecting socialization, language, and values.[475] Americans' self-images, social
  viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an
  unusually close degree.[476] While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic
  achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.[477]\nFood\nMain
  article: Cuisine of the United States\n\n\n\n\nApple pie is a food commonly associated
  with American cuisine.\n\n\nMainstream American cuisine is similar to that in other
  Western countries. Wheat is the primary cereal grain with about three-quarters of
  grain products made of wheat flour[478] and many dishes use indigenous ingredients,
  such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup
  which were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers.[479] These
  home grown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular
  holidays; Thanksgiving, when some Americans make traditional foods to celebrate
  the occasion.[480]\n\n\n\n\nRoasted turkey is a traditional menu item of an American
  Thanksgiving dinner.[481]\n\n\nCharacteristic dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken,
  pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants. French
  fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted
  from Italian sources are widely consumed.[482] Americans drink three times as much
  coffee as tea.[483] Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making
  orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages.[484][485]\nAmerican eating
  habits owe a great deal to that of their British culinary roots with some variations.
  Although American lands could grow newer vegetables England could not, most colonists
  would not eat these new foods until accepted by Europeans.[486] Over time American
  foods changed to a point that food critic, John L. Hess stated in 1972: \"Our founding
  fathers were as far superior to our present political leaders in the quality of
  their food as they were in the quality of their prose and intelligence\".[487]\nThe
  American fast food industry, the world's largest,[488] pioneered the drive-through
  format in the 1940s.[489] Fast food consumption has sparked health concerns. During
  the 1980s and 1990s, Americans' caloric intake rose 24%;[482] frequent dining at
  fast food outlets is associated with what public health officials call the American
  \"obesity epidemic\".[490] Highly sweetened soft drinks are widely popular, and
  sugared beverages account for nine percent of American caloric intake.[491]\nLiterature,
  philosophy, and the arts\nMain articles: American literature, American philosophy,
  Visual art of the United States and American classical music\n\n\n\n\nMark Twain,
  American author and humorist.\n\n\nIn the 18th and early 19th centuries, American
  art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as Nathaniel
  Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American
  literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman
  were major figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown
  during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American poet.[492] A work
  seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character—such
  as Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851), Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
  (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925) and Harper Lee's To Kill a
  Mockingbird (1960)— may be dubbed the \"Great American Novel\".[493]\nEleven U.S.
  citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Toni Morrison in
  1993. William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck are often named among
  the most influential writers of the 20th century.[494] Popular literary genres such
  as the Western and hardboiled crime fiction developed in the United States. The
  Beat Generation writers opened up new literary approaches, as have postmodernist
  authors such as John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, and Don DeLillo.[495]\nThe transcendentalists,
  led by Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, established the first major American philosophical
  movement. After the Civil War, Charles Sanders Peirce and then William James and
  John Dewey were leaders in the development of pragmatism. In the 20th century, the
  work of W. V. O. Quine and Richard Rorty, and later Noam Chomsky, brought analytic
  philosophy to the fore of American philosophical academia. John Rawls and Robert
  Nozick led a revival of political philosophy. Cornel West and Judith Butler have
  led a continental tradition in American philosophical academia. Chicago school economists
  like Milton Friedman, James M. Buchanan, and Thomas Sowell have impacted various
  fields in social and political philosophy.[496][497]\nIn the visual arts, the Hudson
  River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism.
  The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory
  Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public
  and transformed the U.S. art scene.[498]Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others
  experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as
  the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop
  art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States.
  The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects
  such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[499]\n\n\n\n\nTimes
  Square in New York City, the hub of the Broadway theater district[500]\n\n\nOne
  of the first major promoters of American theater was impresario P. T. Barnum, who
  began operating a lower Manhattan entertainment complex in 1841. The team of Harrigan
  and Hart produced a series of popular musical comedies in New York starting in the
  late 1870s. In the 20th century, the modern musical form emerged on Broadway; the
  songs of musical theater composers such as Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Stephen
  Sondheim have become pop standards. Playwright Eugene O'Neill won the Nobel literature
  prize in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple Pulitzer Prize winners
  Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, and August Wilson.[501]\nThough little known at
  the time, Charles Ives's work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S.
  composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell
  and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition.
  Aaron Copland and George Gershwin developed a new synthesis of popular and classical
  music. Choreographers Isadora Duncan and Martha Graham helped create modern dance,
  while George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins were leaders in 20th-century ballet.
  Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography,
  with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and Ansel
  Adams.[502]\nMusic\nMain article: Music of the United States\nThe rhythmic and lyrical
  styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large,
  distinguishing it from European traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the
  blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into
  popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis
  Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed
  in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s.[503]\nElvis Presley and Chuck Berry
  were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged
  from the folk revival to become one of America's most celebrated songwriters and
  James Brown led the development of funk. More recent American creations include
  hip hop and house music. American pop stars such as Presley, Michael Jackson, and
  Madonna have become global celebrities,[503] as have contemporary musical artists
  such as Taylor Swift, Britney Spears, Katy Perry, and Beyoncé as well as hip hop
  artists Jay Z, Eminem and Kanye West.[504] Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles,
  and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales.[505][506][507]\nCinema\nMain
  article: Cinema of the United States\n\n\n\n\nThe Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles,
  California\n\n\nHollywood, a northern district of Los Angeles, California, is one
  of the leaders in motion picture production.[508] The world's first commercial motion
  picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope.[509]
  The next year saw the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New
  York, and the United States was in the forefront of sound film's development in
  the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has
  largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing
  number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the
  forces of globalization.[510]\nDirector D. W. Griffith, American's top filmmaker
  during the silent film period, was central to the development of film grammar, and
  producer/entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising.[511]
  Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West and history,
  and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with
  location shooting, with great influence on subsequent directors. The industry enjoyed
  its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\",
  from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[512] with screen actors such
  as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[513][514] In the 1970s,
  film directors such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Robert Altman were
  a vital component in what became known as \"New Hollywood\" or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\",[515]
  grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war
  period.[516] Since, directors such as Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and James Cameron
  have gained renown for their blockbuster films, often characterized by high production
  costs, and in return, high earnings at the box office, with Cameron's Avatar (2009)
  earning more than $2 billion.[517]\nNotable films topping the American Film Institute's
  AFI 100 list include Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941), which is frequently cited
  as the greatest film of all time,[518][519]Casablanca (1942), The Godfather (1972),
  Gone with the Wind (1939), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), The Wizard of Oz (1939), The
  Graduate (1967), On the Waterfront (1954), Schindler's List (1993), Singin' in the
  Rain (1952), It's a Wonderful Life (1946) and Sunset Boulevard (1950).[520] The
  Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy
  of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[521] and the Golden Globe Awards
  have been held annually since January 1944.[522]\nSports\nMain article: Sports in
  the United States\n\n\n\n\nSwimmer Michael Phelps and then-President George W. Bush
  August 10, 2008 at the National Aquatic Center in Beijing. Phelps is the most decorated
  Olympic athlete of all time.[523][524]\n\n\nWhile most major U.S. sports have evolved
  out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding
  are American inventions, some of which have become popular in other countries. Lacrosse
  and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate
  Western contact.[525] The Iroquois field their own separate national team, the Iroquois
  Nationals, in recognition of the confederacy's creation of lacrosse. Eight Olympic
  Games have taken place in the United States. The United States has won 2,400 medals
  at the Summer Olympic Games, more than any other country, and 281 in the Winter
  Olympic Games, the second most behind Norway.[526]\nThe market for professional
  sports in the United States is roughly $69 billion, roughly 50% larger than that
  of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[527]Baseball has been regarded
  as the national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball (MLB)
  being the top league, while American football is now by several measures the most
  popular spectator sport,[528] with the National Football League (NFL) having the
  highest average attendance of any sports league in the world and a Super Bowl watched
  by millions globally. Basketball and ice hockey are the country's next two leading
  professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association
  (NBA) and the National Hockey League (NHL). These four major sports, when played
  professionally, each occupy a season at different, but overlapping, times of the
  year. College football and basketball attract large audiences.[529]\nBoxing and
  horse racing were once the most watched individual sports,[530] but they have been
  eclipsed by golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR.[531] In the 21st century,
  televised mixed martial arts has also gained a strong following of regular viewers.[532][533]
  While soccer is less popular in the United States compared to many other nations,
  the country hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the men's national soccer team has been
  to the past six World Cups. The United States women's national soccer team won the
  women's world cup three times, highest in the world.[534]Major League Soccer is
  the professional soccer league in the United States.\nInfrastructure\nTransportation\nMain
  article: Transportation in the United States\n\n\n\n\nThe Interstate Highway System,
  which extends 46,876 miles (75,440 km).[535]\n\n\nPersonal transportation is dominated
  by automobiles, which operate on a network of 4 million miles of public roads,[536]
  including one of the world's longest highway systems at 57,000 miles.[537] The world's
  second largest automobile market,[538] the United States has the highest rate of
  per-capita vehicle ownership in the world, with 765 vehicles per 1,000 Americans.[539]
  About 40% of personal vehicles are vans, SUVs, or light trucks.[540] The average
  American adult (accounting for all drivers and non-drivers) spends 55 minutes driving
  every day, traveling 29 miles (47 km).[541]\nMass transit accounts for 9% of total
  U.S. work trips.[542][543]Transport of goods by rail is extensive, though relatively
  low numbers of passengers (approximately 31 million annually) use intercity rail
  to travel, partly because of the low population density throughout much of the U.S.
  interior.[544][545] However, ridership on Amtrak, the national intercity passenger
  rail system, grew by almost 37% between 2000 and 2010.[546] Also, light rail development
  has increased in recent years.[547] Bicycle usage for work commutes is minimal.[548]\n\n\n\n\nThe
  U.S. power transmission grid consists of about 300,000 km (190,000 mi) of lines
  operated by approximately 500 companies. The North American Electric Reliability
  Corporation (NERC) oversees all of them.\n\n\nThe civil airline industry is entirely
  privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while most major airports
  are publicly owned.[549] The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried
  are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US
  Airways.[550] Of the world's 30 busiest passenger airports, 12 are in the United
  States, including the busiest, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport.[551]\nEnergy\nFurther
  information: Energy policy of the United States\nThe United States energy market
  is about 29,000 terawatt hours per year.[552]Energy consumption per capita is 7.8 tons
  of oil equivalent per year, the 10th highest rate in the world. In 2005, 40% of
  this energy came from petroleum, 23% from coal, and 22% from natural gas. The remainder
  was supplied by nuclear power and renewable energy sources.[553] The United States
  is the world's largest consumer of petroleum.[554]\nFor decades, nuclear power has
  played a limited role relative to many other developed countries, in part because
  of public perception in the wake of a 1979 accident. In 2007, several applications
  for new nuclear plants were filed.[555] The United States has 27% of global coal
  reserves.[556] It is the world's largest producer of natural gas and crude oil.[557]\nWater
  supply and sanitation\nMain article: Water supply and sanitation in the United States\nIssues
  that affect water supply and sanitation in the United States include water scarcity,
  pollution, a backlog of investment, concerns about the affordability of water for
  the poorest, and a rapidly retiring workforce. Increased variability and intensity
  of rainfall as a result of climate change is expected to produce both more severe
  droughts and flooding, with potentially serious consequences for water supply and
  for pollution from combined sewer overflows.[558][559] Droughts are likely to particularly
  affect the 66 percent of Americans whose communities depend on surface water.[560]
  As for drinking water quality, there are concerns about disinfection by-products,
  lead, perchlorates and pharmaceutical substances, but generally drinking water quality
  in the U.S. is good.[561]\nCities, utilities, state governments and the federal
  government have addressed the above issues in various ways. To keep pace with demand
  from an increasing population, utilities traditionally have augmented supplies.
  However, faced with increasing costs and droughts, water conservation is beginning
  to receive more attention and is being supported through the federal WaterSense
  program. The reuse of treated wastewater for non-potable uses is also becoming increasingly
  common. Pollution through wastewater discharges, a major issue in the 1960s, has
  been brought largely under control.\nMost Americans are served by publicly owned
  water and sewer utilities. Eleven percent of Americans receive water from private
  (so-called \"investor-owned\") utilities. In rural areas, cooperatives often provide
  drinking water. Finally, up to 15 percent of Americans are served by their own wells.[562][563]
  Water supply and wastewater systems are regulated by state governments and the federal
  government. At the state level, health and environmental regulation is entrusted
  to the corresponding state-level departments. Public Utilities Commissions or Public
  Service Commissions regulate tariffs charged by private utilities. In some states
  they also regulate tariffs by public utilities. At the federal level, drinking water
  quality and wastewater discharges are regulated by the United States Environmental
  Protection Agency, which also provides funding to utilities through State Revolving
  Funds.[564][565][566]\nWater consumption in the United States is more than double
  that in Central Europe, with large variations among the states. In 2002 the average
  American family spent $474 on water and sewerage charges,[567] which is about the
  same level as in Europe. The median household spent about 1.1 percent of its income
  on water and sewerage.[568]\nScience and technology\nMain article: Science and technology
  in the United States\n\n\n\n\nAstronaut James Irwin walking on the Moon next to
  Apollo 15's landing module and lunar rover in 1971. The effort to reach the Moon
  was triggered by the Space Race.\n\n\nThe United States has been a leader in scientific
  research and technological innovation since the late 19th century. Methods for producing
  Interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories
  during the first half of the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment
  of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large scale manufacturing of
  sewing machines, bicycles and other items in the late 19th century and became known
  as the American system of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th
  century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor saving techniques
  created the system called mass production.[569]\nIn 1876, Alexander Graham Bell
  was awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone. Thomas Edison's research laboratory,
  one of the first of its kind, developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light
  bulb, and the first viable movie camera.[570] The latter lead to emergence of the
  worldwide entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies
  of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The Wright brothers,
  in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.[571]\nThe
  rise of Nazism in the 1930s led many European scientists, including Albert Einstein,
  Enrico Fermi, and John von Neumann, to immigrate to the United States.[572] During
  World War II, the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic
  Age, while the Space Race produced rapid advances in rocketry, materials science,
  and aeronautics.[573][574]\nThe invention of the transistor in the 1950s, a key
  active component in practically all modern electronics, led to many technological
  developments and a significant expansion of the U.S. technology industry.[575][576][577]
  This in turn led to the establishment of many new technology companies and regions
  around the county such as Silicon Valley in California. Advancements by American
  microprocessor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel along with
  both computer software and hardware companies that include Adobe Systems, Apple
  Computer, IBM, GNU-Linux, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems created and popularized
  the personal computer. The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department
  requirements, and became the first of a series of networks which evolved into the
  Internet.[578]\nThese advancements then lead to greater personalization of technology
  for individual use.[579] As of 2013[update], 83.8% of American households owned
  at least one computer, and 73.3% had high-speed Internet service.[580] 91% of Americans
  also own a mobile phone as of May 2013[update].[581] The United States ranks highly
  with regard to freedom of use of the internet.[582]\nIn the 21st century, 64% of
  research and development funding comes from the private sector.[583] The United
  States leads the world in scientific research papers and impact factor.[584]\nHealth\nSee

  US$ PPP-adjusted, compared amongst various first world nations.\n\n\nThe United
  States has a life expectancy of 79.8 years at birth, up from 75.2 years in 1990.[585][586][587]
  Increasing obesity in the United States and health improvements elsewhere have contributed
  to lowering the country's rank in life expectancy from 1987, when it was 11th in
  the world.[588]Obesity rates in the United States are amongst the highest in the
  world.[589]\nApproximately one-third of the adult population is obese and an additional
  third is overweight;[590] the obesity rate, the highest in the industrialized world,
  has more than doubled in the last quarter-century.[591] Obesity-related type 2 diabetes
  is considered epidemic by health care professionals.[592] The infant mortality rate
  of 6.17 per thousand places the United States 169th highest out of 224 countries,
  with the 224th country having the lowest mortality rate.[593]\nIn 2010, coronary
  artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and
  traffic accidents caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain,
  depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years
  lost to disability. The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking,
  obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol
  use. Alzheimer's disease, drug abuse, kidney disease and cancer, and falls caused
  the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.[587]
  U.S. teenage pregnancy and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other
  Western nations, especially among blacks and Hispanics.[594] U.S. underage drinking
  among teenagers is among the lowest in industrialized nations.[595]\nThe U.S. is
  a global leader in medical innovation. America solely developed or contributed significantly
  to 9 of the top 10 most important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by a
  2001 poll of physicians, while the EU and Switzerland together contributed to five.[596]
  Since 1966, more Americans have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine than the rest
  of the world combined. From 1989 to 2002, four times more money was invested in
  private biotechnology companies in America than in Europe.[597] The U.S. health-care
  system far outspends any other nation, measured in both per capita spending and
  percentage of GDP.[598]\nHealth-care coverage in the United States is a combination
  of public and private efforts and is not universal. In 2014, 13.4% of the population
  did not carry health insurance.[599] The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans
  is a major political issue.[600][601] In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state
  to mandate universal health insurance.[602]Federal legislation passed in early 2010
  would ostensibly create a near-universal health insurance system around the country
  by 2014, though the bill and its ultimate impact are issues of controversy.[603][604]\nMedia\nMain
  article: Media of the United States\n\n\n\n\nThe corporate headquarters of the American
  Broadcasting Company in New York City.\n\n\nThe four major broadcasters in the U.S.
  are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS),
  the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and Fox. The four major broadcast television
  networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels
  catering to a variety of niches.[605] Americans listen to radio programming, also
  largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day.[606]\nIn 1998,
  the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and
  5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these
  stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes
  and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions and corporate underwriting.
  Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR (formerly National Public Radio).
  NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967;
  its television counterpart, PBS, was also created by the same legislation. (NPR
  and PBS are operated separately from each other.) As of September 30, 2014[update],
  there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the US according to the U.S.
  Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[607]\nWell-known newspapers are The New
  York Times, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal. Although the cost of publishing
  has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low,
  forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided
  by a major wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national
  and world coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are
  privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own
  dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers;
  or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities
  often have \"alternative weeklies\" to complement the mainstream daily papers, for
  example, New York City's The Village Voice or Los Angeles' LA Weekly, to name two
  of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade
  papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups.
  Early versions of the American newspaper comic strip and the American comic book
  began appearing in the 19th century. In 1938, Superman, the comic book superhero
  of DC Comics, developed into an American icon.[608] Aside from web portals and search
  engines, the most popular websites are Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Yahoo.com,
  eBay, Amazon and Twitter.[609]\nIn Spanish, the second most widely spoken mother

  presided over the greatest military and economic power the world had ever known.
  War production had lifted the United States out of the Great Depression and had
  inaugurated an era of unimagined prosperity. Gross national product increased by
  60 percent during the war, total earnings by 50 percent. Despite social unrest,
  labor agitation, racial conflict, and teenage vandalism, Americans had more discretionary
  income than ever before. Simultaneously, the U.S. government had built up the greatest
  war machine in human history. By the end of 1942, the United States was producing
  more arms than all the Axis states combined, and, in 1943, it made almost three
  times more armaments than did the Soviet Union. In 1945, the United States had two-thirds
  of the world's gold reserves, three-fourths of its invested capital, half of its
  shipping vessels, and half of its manufacturing capacity. Its GNP was three times
  that of the Soviet Union and more than five times that of Britain. It was also nearing
  completion of the atomic bomb, a technological and production feat of huge costs
  and proportions.\"\n^ \"The United States and the Founding of the United Nations,

  /* @nomin */\n} );The United States of America (USA), commonly referred to as the
  United States (U.S.) or America, is a federal republic[19][20] composed of 50 states,
  a federal district, five major territories and various possessions.[fn 1][fn 2]
  The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between
  Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the northwestern part of North America
  and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories are
  scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. At 3.8 million square miles
  (9.842 million km2)[18] and with over 320 million people, the country is the world's
  third or fourth-largest by total area[fn 3] and the third most populous. It is one
  of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of
  large-scale immigration from many countries.[26] The geography and climate of the
  United States are also extremely diverse, and the country is home to a wide variety
  of wildlife.[27]Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland
  at least 15,000 years ago,[28] with European colonization beginning in the 16th
  century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast.
  Disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolution.
  On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary
  War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence.
  The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the United States
  by the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence
  against a European colonial empire.[29] The country's constitution was adopted on
  September 17, 1787, and ratified by the states in 1788. The first ten amendments,
  collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee
  many fundamental civil liberties.Driven by the doctrine of Manifest Destiny, the
  United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the
  19th century.[30] This involved displacing American Indian tribes, acquiring new
  territories, and gradually admitting new states, until by 1848 the nation spanned
  the continent.[30] During the second half of the 19th century, the American Civil
  War ended legal slavery in the country.[31][32] By the end of that century, the
  United States extended into the Pacific Ocean,[33] and its economy, driven in large
  part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar.[34] The Spanish–American War and
  World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United
  States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country to develop
  nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member
  of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution
  of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.[35]The
  United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy
  by nominal and real GDP, benefiting from an abundance of natural resources and high
  worker productivity.[36] While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, the
  country continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers.[37] Accounting
  for 34% of global military spending[38] and 23% of world GDP,[39] it is the world's
  foremost military and economic power, a prominent political and cultural force,
  and a leader in scientific research and technological innovations.[40]In 1507, the
  German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller produced a world map on which he named
  the lands of the Western Hemisphere \"America\" after the Italian explorer and cartographer
  Amerigo Vespucci (Latin: Americus Vespucius).[41] The first documentary evidence
  of the phrase \"United States of America\" is from a letter dated January 2, 1776,
  written by Stephen Moylan, Esq., George Washington's aide-de-camp and Muster-Master
  General of the Continental Army. Addressed to Lt. Col. Joseph Reed, Moylan expressed
  his wish to carry the \"full and ample powers of the United States of America\"
  to Spain to assist in the revolutionary war effort.[42]The first known publication
  of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia
  Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia, on April 6, 1776.[43][44] In June 1776,
  Thomas Jefferson wrote the phrase \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" in all capitalized
  letters in the headline of his \"original Rough draught\" of the Declaration of
  Independence.[45][46] In the final Fourth of July version of the Declaration, the
  title was changed to read, \"The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States
  of America\".[47] In 1777 the Articles of Confederation announced, \"The Stile of
  this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America'\".[48] The preamble of
  the Constitution states \"...establish this Constitution for the United States of
  America.\"The short form \"United States\" is also standard. Other common forms
  are the \"U.S.\", the \"USA\", and \"America\". Colloquial names are the \"U.S.
  of A.\" and, internationally, the \"States\". \"Columbia\", a name popular in poetry
  and songs of the late 1700s, derives its origin from Christopher Columbus; it appears
  in the name \"District of Columbia\".[49] In non-English languages, the name is
  frequently the translation of either the \"United States\" or \"United States of
  America\", and colloquially as \"America\". In addition, an abbreviation (e.g. USA)
  is sometimes used.[50]The phrase \"United States\" was originally plural, a description
  of a collection of independent states—e.g., \"the United States are\"—including
  in the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1865.
  The singular form—e.g., \"the United States is\"— became popular after the end of
  the American Civil War. The singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained
  in the idiom \"these United States\".[51] The difference is more significant than
  usage; it is a difference between a collection of states and a unit.[52]A citizen
  of the United States is an \"American\". \"United States\", \"American\" and \"U.S.\"
  refer to the country adjectivally (\"American values\", \"U.S. forces\"). \"American\"
  rarely refers to subjects not connected with the United States.[53]The first inhabitants
  of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived
  at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival.[28]
  Some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture, developed advanced agriculture,
  grand architecture, and state-level societies. After the Spanish conquistadors made
  the first contacts, the native population declined for various reasons, primarily
  diseases such as smallpox and measles. Violence was not a significant factor in
  the overall decline, though it impacted specific tribes and colonial settlements.[54][55][56][57][58][59]
  In the Hawaiian Islands the earliest indigenous inhabitants arrived around 1 AD
  from Polynesia. Captain James Cook arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in 1778[60] with
  American contact made in 1790 with the first ship to dock arriving in Oahu.[61]In
  the early days of colonization many European settlers were subject to food shortages,
  disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at
  war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their colonial wars.[62]
  At the same time, however, many natives and settlers came to depend on each other.
  Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other
  European wares.[63] Natives taught many settlers where, when and how to cultivate
  corn, beans and squash. European missionaries and others felt it was important to
  \"civilize\" the Indians and urged them to adopt European agricultural techniques
  and lifestyles.[64][65]After Columbus' first voyage to the New World in 1492, other
  explorers followed with settlement into the Floridas and the American Southwest.[66][67]
  There were also some French attempts to colonize the east coast, and later more
  successful settlements along the Mississippi River. Successful English settlement
  on the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at
  Jamestown and the Pilgrims' Plymouth Colony in 1620. Early experiments in communal
  living failed until the introduction of private farm holdings.[68] Many settlers
  were dissenting Christian groups who came seeking religious freedom. The continent's
  first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's House of Burgesses created in 1619,
  and the Mayflower Compact, signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking, established
  precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism
  that would develop throughout the American colonies.[69][70]Most settlers in every
  colony were small farmers, but other industries developed within a few decades as
  varied as the settlements. Cash crops included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction
  industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships,
  and by the late colonial period Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's
  iron supply.[71] Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and
  serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish
  and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive freed indentured servants
  pushed further west.[72]Slave cultivation of cash crops began with the Spanish in
  the 1500s, and was adopted by the English, but life expectancy was much higher in
  North America because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to
  a rapid increase in the numbers of slaves.[73][74][75] Colonial society was largely
  divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed
  acts for and against the practice.[76][77] But by the turn of the 18th century,
  African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially
  in southern regions.[78]With the British colonization of Georgia in 1732, the 13
  colonies that would become the United States of America were established.[79] All
  had local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion
  to the ancient rights of Englishmen and a sense of self-government stimulating support
  for republicanism.[80] With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady
  settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly. Relatively small Native American
  populations were eclipsed.[81] The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and
  1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in both religion and religious
  liberty.[82]In the French and Indian War, British forces seized Canada from the
  French, but the francophone population remained politically isolated from the southern
  colonies. Excluding the Native Americans, who were being conquered and displaced,
  those 13 colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third
  that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was
  such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[83]
  The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government,
  but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.[84]The
  American Revolutionary War was the first successful colonial war of independence
  against a European power. Americans had developed an ideology of \"republicanism\"
  asserting that government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their
  local legislatures. They demanded their rights as Englishmen, \"no taxation without
  representation\". The British insisted on administering the empire through Parliament,
  and the conflict escalated into war.[85]Following the passage of the Lee Resolution,
  on July 2, 1776, which was the actual vote for independence, the Congress adopted
  the Declaration of Independence, on July 4, which proclaimed, in a long preamble,
  that humanity is created equal in their unalienable rights and that those rights
  were not being protected by Great Britain, and finally declared, in the words of
  the resolution, that the Thirteen Colonies were independent states and had no allegiance
  to the British crown in the United States. The fourth day of July is celebrated
  annually as Independence Day. In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established
  a weak government that operated until 1789.[86]Britain recognized the independence
  of the United States following their defeat at Yorktown.[87] In the peace treaty
  of 1783, American sovereignty was recognized from the Atlantic coast west to the
  Mississippi River. Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing
  the United States Constitution, ratified in state conventions in 1788. The federal
  government was reorganized into three branches, on the principle of creating salutary
  checks and balances, in 1789. George Washington, who had led the revolutionary army
  to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill
  of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing
  a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.[88]Although the federal government
  criminalized the international slave trade in 1808, after 1820 cultivation of the
  highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it the
  slave population.[89][90][91] The Second Great Awakening, beginning about 1800,
  converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North it energized multiple
  social reform movements, including abolitionism;[92] in the South, Methodists and
  Baptists proselytized among slave populations.[93]Americans' eagerness to expand
  westward prompted a long series of American Indian Wars.[94] The Louisiana Purchase
  of French-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nation's size.[95] The War
  of 1812, declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw,
  strengthened U.S. nationalism.[96] A series of U.S. military incursions into Florida
  led Spain to cede it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[97] Expansion was aided
  by steam power, when steamboats began traveling along America's large water systems,
  which were connected by new canals, such as the Erie and the I&M; then, even faster
  railroads began their stretch across the nation's land.[98]From 1820 to 1850, Jacksonian
  democracy began a set of reforms which included wider male suffrage; it led to the
  rise of the Second Party System of Democrats and Whigs as the dominant parties from
  1828 to 1854. The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy
  that moved Indians into the west to their own reservations. The U.S. annexed the
  Republic of Texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest destiny.[99]
  The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American
  Northwest.[100] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican
  Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.[101]The California
  Gold Rush of 1848–49 spurred western migration and the creation of additional western
  states.[102] After the American Civil War, new transcontinental railways made relocation
  easier for settlers, expanded internal trade and increased conflicts with Native
  Americans.[103] Over a half-century, the loss of the American bison (sometimes called
  \"buffalo\") was an existential blow to many Plains Indians cultures.[104] In 1869,
  a new Peace Policy sought to protect Native-Americans from abuses, avoid further
  war, and secure their eventual U.S. citizenship, although conflicts, including several
  of the largest Indian Wars, continued throughout the West into the 1900s.[105]Differences
  of opinion and social order between northern and southern states in early United
  States society, particularly regarding Black slavery, ultimately led the U.S. into
  the American Civil War.[106] Initially, states entering the Union alternated between
  slave and free states, keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states
  outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But
  with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave
  and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories,
  whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.[107]With the 1860 election of Abraham
  Lincoln, the first president from the largely anti-slavery Republican Party, conventions
  in thirteen states ultimately declared secession and formed the Confederate States
  of America, while the U.S. federal government maintained that secession was illegal.[107]
  The ensuing war was at first for Union, then after 1863 as casualties mounted and
  Lincoln delivered his Emancipation Proclamation, a second war aim became abolition
  of slavery. The war remains the deadliest military conflict in American history,
  resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians.[108]Following
  the Union victory in 1865, three amendments to the U.S. Constitution brought about
  the prohibition of slavery, gave U.S. citizenship to the nearly four million African
  Americans who had been slaves,[109] and promised them voting rights. The war and
  its resolution led to a substantial increase in federal power[110] aimed at reintegrating
  and rebuilding the Southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed
  slaves.[111] Following the Reconstruction Era, throughout the South Jim Crow laws
  soon effectively disenfranchised most blacks and some poor whites. Over the subsequent
  decades, in both the North and the South blacks and some whites faced systemic discrimination,
  including racial segregation and occasional vigilante violence, sparking national
  movements against these abuses.[111]In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented
  influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor
  for the country's industrialization and transformed its culture.[112] National infrastructure
  including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater
  settlement and development of the American Old West. The later invention of electric
  light and the telephone would also impact communication and urban life.[113]The
  end of the Indian Wars further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation, increasing
  surpluses for international markets.[114] Mainland expansion was completed by the
  purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.[115] In 1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii
  overthrew the monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii, which the U.S. annexed
  in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same
  year, following the Spanish–American War.[116]Rapid economic development at the
  end of the 19th century produced many prominent industrialists, and the U.S. economy
  became the world's largest.[117] Dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest
  and the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[118] This period eventually
  ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms in many
  societal areas, including women's suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer
  goods, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker
  conditions.The United States remained neutral from the outbreak of World War I,
  in 1914, until 1917 when it joined the war as an \"associated power\", alongside
  the formal Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers.
  In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the Paris Peace
  Conference and advocated strongly for the U.S. to join the League of Nations. However,
  the Senate refused to approve this, and did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles
  that established the League of Nations.[119]In 1920, the women's rights movement
  won passage of a constitutional amendment granting women's suffrage.[120] The 1920s
  and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early
  television.[121] The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street
  Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression. After his election as president
  in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal, which included the establishment
  of the Social Security system.[122] The Great Migration of millions of African Americans
  out of the American South began around WWI and extended through the 1960s;[123]
  whereas the Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and
  spurred a new wave of western migration.[124]The United States was at first effectively
  neutral during World War II's early stages but began supplying material to the Allies
  in March 1941 through the Lend-Lease program. On December 7, 1941, the Empire of
  Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, prompting the United States to
  join the Allies against the Axis powers.[125] During the war, the United States
  was referred as one of the \"Four Policemen\"[126] of Allies power who met to plan
  the post-war world, along with Britain, the Soviet Union and China.[127][128] Though
  the nation lost more than 400,000 soldiers,[129] it emerged relatively undamaged
  from the war with even greater economic and military influence.[130]Allied conferences
  at Bretton Woods and Yalta outlined a new system of international organizations
  that placed the United States and Soviet Union at the center of world affairs. As
  an Allied victory was won in Europe, a 1945 international conference held in San
  Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became active after the war.[131]
  The United States developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan; the
  Japanese surrendered on September 2, ending World War II.[132]After World War II
  the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed for power during what is known as
  the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism[133]
  and, according to the school of geopolitics, a divide between the maritime Atlantic
  and the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe,
  with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies
  on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of
  communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed
  powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.The
  U.S. often opposed Third World movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored. American
  troops fought communist Chinese and North Korean forces in the Korean War of 1950–53.[134]
  The Soviet Union's 1957 launch of the first artificial satellite and its 1961 launch
  of the first manned spaceflight initiated a \"Space Race\" in which the United States
  became the first nation to land a man on the moon in 1969.[134] A proxy war in Southeast
  Asia eventually evolved into full American participation, as the Vietnam War.[fn
  4]At home, the U.S. experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid growth
  of its population and middle class. Construction of an Interstate Highway System
  transformed the nation's infrastructure over the following decades. Millions moved
  from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments.[141][142] In
  1959 Hawaii became the 50th and last state added to the US.[143] A growing civil
  rights movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination, with
  Martin Luther King, Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead. A combination
  of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
  sought to end racial discrimination.[144][145][146] Meanwhile, a counterculture
  movement grew which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war, black nationalism,
  and the sexual revolution. The launch of a \"War on Poverty\" expanded entitlement
  and welfare spending.[147]The 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation.
  After his election in 1980, President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation
  with free-market oriented reforms. Following the collapse of détente, he abandoned
  \"containment\" and initiated the more aggressive \"rollback\" strategy towards
  the USSR.[148][149][150][151][152] After a surge in female labor participation over
  the previous decade, by 1985 the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[153]The
  late 1980s brought a \"thaw\" in relations with the USSR, and its collapse in 1991
  finally ended the Cold War.[154][155][156][157] This brought about unipolarity[158]
  with the U.S. unchallenged as the world's dominant superpower. The concept of Pax
  Americana, which had appeared in the post-World War II period, gained wide popularity
  as a term for the post-Cold War new world order.After the Cold War, the 1990s saw
  the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history, ending in 2001.[159]Originating
  in U.S. defense networks, the Internet spread to international academic networks,
  and then to the public in the 1990s, greatly impacting the global economy, society,
  and culture.[160] On September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda terrorists struck the World Trade
  Center in New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000
  people.[161] In response, the United States launched the War on Terror, which includes
  the ongoing war in Afghanistan and the 2003–11 Iraq War.[162][163]Beginning in 1994,
  the U.S. entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), linking 450
  million people producing $17 trillion worth of goods and services. The goal of the
  agreement was to eliminate trade and investment barriers among the U.S., Canada,
  and Mexico by January 1, 2008; trade among the partners has soared since the agreement
  went into force.[164]Barack Obama, the first African American,[165] and multiracial[166]
  president, was elected in 2008 amid the Great Recession,[167] which began in December
  2007 and ended in June 2009.[168]The land area of the contiguous United States is
  2,959,064 square miles (7.7 Mm2). Alaska, separated from the contiguous United States
  by Canada, is the largest state at 663,268 square miles (1.7 Mm2). Hawaii, occupying
  an archipelago in the central Pacific, southwest of North America, is 10,931 square
  miles (28,311 km2) in area. The populated territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa,
  Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and US Virgin Islands together cover 9,185 square
  miles (23,789 km2)[169]The United States is the world's third or fourth largest
  nation by total area (land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and just
  above or below China. The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed
  by China and India are counted and how the total size of the United States is measured:
  calculations range from 3,676,486 square miles (9.5 Mm2)[170] to 3,717,813 square
  miles (9.6 Mm2)[171] to 3,794,101 square miles (9.8 Mm2)[5] to 3,805,927 square
  miles (9.9 Mm2).[18] Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size
  behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada.[172]The coastal plain of the Atlantic
  seaboard gives way further inland to deciduous forests and the rolling hills of
  the Piedmont.[173] The Appalachian Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the
  Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[174] The Mississippi–Missouri River,
  the world's fourth longest river system, runs mainly north–south through the heart
  of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west,
  interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[174]The Rocky Mountains, at the
  western edge of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, reaching
  altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado.[175] Farther west are the
  rocky Great Basin and deserts such as the Chihuahua and Mojave.[176] The Sierra
  Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast, both ranges reaching
  altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m). The lowest and highest points in the
  contiguous United States are in the state of California,[177] and only about 84
  miles (135 km) apart.[178] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's
  Denali (Mount McKinley) is the highest peak in the country and North America.[179]
  Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands,
  and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone
  National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.[180]The
  United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate
  types. To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental
  in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[181] The Great Plains west of the
  100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western mountains have an alpine climate.
  The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in
  coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska.
  Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are
  tropical, as are the populated territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[182]
  Extreme weather is not uncommon—the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone
  to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur within the country, mainly
  in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South.[183]The U.S. ecology is megadiverse:
  about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and
  Alaska, and over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which
  occur on the mainland.[184] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784
  bird species, 311 reptile species, and 295 amphibian species.[185] About 91,000
  insect species have been described.[186] The bald eagle is both the national bird
  and national animal of the United States, and is an enduring symbol of the country
  itself.[187]There are 58 national parks and hundreds of other federally managed
  parks, forests, and wilderness areas.[188] Altogether, the government owns about
  28% of the country's land area.[189] Most of this is protected, though some is leased
  for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching; about .86% is used
  for military purposes.[190][191]Environmental issues have been on the national agenda
  since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy,
  dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife,
  logging and deforestation,[192][193] and international responses to global warming.[194][195]
  Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental
  Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970.[196] The idea of
  wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness
  Act.[197] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and
  endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States
  Fish and Wildlife Service.[198]The U.S. Census Bureau currently estimates the country's
  population to be 322,431,000.[200] The U.S. population almost quadrupled during
  the 20th century, from about 76 million in 1900.[201] The third most populous nation
  in the world, after China and India, the United States is the only major industrialized
  nation in which large population increases are projected.[202] In the 1800s the
  average woman had 7.04 children, by the 1900s this number had decreased to 3.56.[203]
  Since the early 1970s the birth rate has been below the replacement rate of 2.1
  with 1.86 children per woman in 2014. Foreign born immigration has caused the US
  population to continue its rapid increase with the foreign born population doubling
  from almost 20 million in 1990 to over 40 million in 2010, representing one third
  of the population increase.[204] The foreign born population reached 45 million
  in 2015.[205]The United States has a very diverse population; 37 ancestry groups
  have more than one million members.[206]German Americans are the largest ethnic
  group (more than 50 million) – followed by Irish Americans (circa 37 million), Mexican
  Americans (circa 31 million) and English Americans (circa 28 million).[207][208]White
  Americans are the largest racial group; Black Americans are the nation's largest
  racial minority (note that in the U.S. Census, Hispanic and Latino Americans are
  counted as an ethnic group, not a racial group), and third largest ancestry group.[206]Asian
  Americans are the country's second largest racial minority; the three largest Asian
  American ethnic groups are Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, and Indian Americans.[206]The
  United States has a birth rate of 13 per 1,000, which is 5 births below the world
  average.[209] Its population growth rate is positive at 0.7%, higher than that of
  many developed nations.[210] In fiscal year 2012, over one million immigrants (most
  of whom entered through family reunification) were granted legal residence.[211]Mexico
  has been the leading source of new residents since the 1965 Immigration Act. China,
  India, and the Philippines have been in the top four sending countries every year
  since the 1990s.[212] As of 2012[update], approximately 11.4 million residents are
  illegal immigrants.[213] As of 2015, 47% of all immigrants are Hispanic, 26% are
  Asian, 18% are white and 8% are black. The percentage of immigrants who are Asian
  is increasing while the percentage who are Hispanic is decreasing.[205]According
  to a survey conducted by the Williams Institute, nine million Americans, or roughly
  3.4% of the adult population identify themselves as homosexual, bisexual, or transgender.[214][215]
  A 2012 Gallup poll also concluded that 3.5% of adult Americans identified as LGBT.
  The highest percentage came from the District of Columbia (10%), while the lowest
  state was North Dakota at 1.7%.[216] In a 2013 survey, the Centers for Disease Control
  and Prevention found that 96.6% of Americans identify as straight, while 1.6% identify
  as gay or lesbian, and 0.7% identify as being bisexual.[217]In 2010, the U.S. population
  included an estimated 5.2 million people with some American Indian or Alaska Native
  ancestry (2.9 million exclusively of such ancestry) and 1.2 million with some native
  Hawaiian or Pacific island ancestry (0.5 million exclusively).[218] The census counted
  more than 19 million people of \"Some Other Race\" who were \"unable to identify
  with any\" of its five official race categories in 2010.[218]The population growth
  of Hispanic and Latino Americans (the terms are officially interchangeable) is a
  major demographic trend. The 50.5 million Americans of Hispanic descent[218] are
  identified as sharing a distinct \"ethnicity\" by the Census Bureau; 64% of Hispanic
  Americans are of Mexican descent.[219] Between 2000 and 2010, the country's Hispanic
  population increased 43% while the non-Hispanic population rose just 4.9%.[220]
  Much of this growth is from immigration; in 2007, 12.6% of the U.S. population was
  foreign-born, with 54% of that figure born in Latin America.[221]Fertility is also
  a factor; in 2010 the average Hispanic woman gave birth to 2.35 children in her
  lifetime, compared to 1.97 for non-Hispanic black women and 1.79 for non-Hispanic
  white women (both below the replacement rate of 2.1).[222]Minorities (as defined
  by the Census Bureau as all those beside non-Hispanic, non-multiracial whites) constituted
  36.3% of the population in 2010 (this is nearly 40% in 2015),[223] and over 50%
  of children under age one,[224] and are projected to constitute the majority by
  2042.[225] This contradicts the report by the National Vital Statistics Reports,
  based on the U.S. census data, which concludes that 54% (2,162,406 out of 3,999,386
  in 2010) of births were non-Hispanic white.[222] The Hispanic birth rate plummeted
  25% between 2006 and 2013 while the rate for non-Hispanics decreased just 5%.[226]About
  82% of Americans live in urban areas (including suburbs);[5] about half of those
  reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[227] The US has numerous clusters
  of cities known as megaregions, the largest being the Great Lakes Megalopolis followed
  by the Northeast Megalopolis and Southern California. In 2008, 273 incorporated
  places had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents,
  and four global cities had over two million (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago,
  and Houston).[228] There are 52 metropolitan areas with populations greater than
  one million.[229] Of the 50 fastest-growing metro areas, 47 are in the West or South.[230]
  The metro areas of San Bernardino, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and Phoenix all grew
  by more than a million people between 2000 and 2008.[229]English (American English)
  is the de facto national language. Although there is no official language at the
  federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English.
  In 2010, about 230 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older,
  spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is
  the second most common language and the most widely taught second language.[232][233]
  Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is
  in 28 states.[13]Both Hawaiian and English are official languages in Hawaii, by
  state law.[234] Alaska recognizes twenty Native languages.[235] While neither has
  an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English
  and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French.[236] Other states, such as
  California, mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents
  including court forms.[237] Many jurisdictions with large numbers of non-English
  speakers produce government materials, especially voting information, in the most
  commonly spoken languages in those jurisdictions.Several insular territories grant
  official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan[238]
  and Chamorro[239] are recognized by American Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian
  and Chamorro are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands;[240]Cherokee is officially
  recognized by the Cherokee Nation within the Cherokee tribal jurisdiction area in
  eastern Oklahoma;[241] Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico and is more
  widely spoken than English there.[242]According to the Center for Immigration Studies,
  Arabic and Urdu (Pakistan's national language) are the fastest growing foreign languages
  spoken at American households. According to the survey, more than 63.2 million US
  residents speak a language other than English at home. In recent years, Arabic speaking
  residents increased by 29%, Urdu by 23% and Persian by 9%.[243]The most widely taught
  foreign languages at all levels in the United States (in terms of enrollment numbers)
  are: Spanish (around 7.2 million students), French (1.5 million), and German (500,000).
  Other commonly taught languages (with 100,000 to 250,000 learners) include Latin,
  Japanese, American Sign Language, Italian, and Chinese.[244][245] 18% of all Americans
  claim to speak at least one language in addition to English.[246]The First Amendment
  of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress
  from passing laws respecting its establishment. Christianity is by far the most
  common religion practiced in the U.S., but other religions are followed, too. In
  a 2013 survey, 56% of Americans said that religion played a \"very important role
  in their lives\", a far higher figure than that of any other wealthy nation.[248]
  In a 2009 Gallup poll 42% of Americans said that they attended church weekly or
  almost weekly; the figures ranged from a low of 23% in Vermont to a high of 63%
  in Mississippi.[249]As with other Western countries, the U.S. is becoming less religious.
  Irreligion is growing rapidly among Americans under 30.[250] Polls show that overall
  American confidence in organized religion is declining,[251] and that younger Americans
  in particular are becoming increasingly irreligious.[247][252] According to a 2012
  study, Protestant share of U.S. population dropped to 48%, thus ending its status
  as religious category of the majority for the first time.[253][254][255] Americans
  with no religion have 1.7 children compared to 2.2 among Christians. The unaffiliated
  are less likely to get married with 37% marrying compared to 52% of Christians.[256]According
  to a 2014 survey, 70.6% of adults identified themselves as Christian,[257]Protestant
  denominations accounted for 46.5%, while Roman Catholicism, at 20.8%, was the largest
  individual denomination.[258] The total reporting non-Christian religions in 2014
  was 5.9%.[258] Other religions include Judaism (1.9%), Islam (0.9%), Buddhism (0.7%),
  Hinduism (0.7%).[258] The survey also reported that 22.8% of Americans described
  themselves as agnostic, atheist or simply having no religion, up from 8.2% in 1990.[258][259][260]
  There are also Unitarian Universalist, Baha'i, Sikh, Jain, Shinto, Confucian, Taoist,
  Druid, Native American, Wiccan, humanist and deist communities.[261]Protestantism
  is the largest Christian religious grouping in the United States. Baptists collectively
  form the largest branch of Protestantism, and the Southern Baptist Convention is
  the largest individual Protestant denomination. About 26% of Americans identify
  as Evangelical Protestants, while 15% are Mainline and 7% belong to a traditionally
  Black church. Roman Catholicism in the United States has its origin in the Spanish
  and French colonization of the Americas, and later grew because of Irish, Italian,
  Polish, German and Hispanic immigration. Rhode Island is the only state where a
  majority of the population is Catholic. Lutheranism in the U.S. has its origin in
  immigration from Northern Europe and Germany. North and South Dakota are the only
  states in which a plurality of the population is Lutheran. Presbyterianism was introduced
  in North America by Scottish and Ulster Scots immigrants. Although it has spread
  across the United States, it is heavily concentrated on the East Coast. Dutch Reformed
  congregations were founded first in New Amsterdam (New York City) before spreading
  westward. Utah is the only state where Mormonism is the religion of the majority
  of the population. The Mormon Corridor also extends to parts of Idaho, Nevada and
  Wyoming.[262]The Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the Southern United
  States in which socially conservative Evangelical Protestantism is a significant
  part of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is
  generally higher than the nation's average. By contrast, religion plays the least
  important role in New England and in the Western United States.[249]As of 2007[update],
  58% of Americans age 18 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced,
  and 25% had never been married.[263] Women now work mostly outside the home and
  receive a majority of bachelor's degrees.[264]The U.S. teenage pregnancy rate is
  26.5 per 1,000 women. The rate has declined by 57% since 1991.[265] In 2013, the
  highest teenage birth rate was in Alabama, and the lowest in Wyoming.[265][266]Abortion
  is legal throughout the U.S., owing to Roe v. Wade, a 1973 landmark decision by
  the Supreme Court of the United States. While the abortion rate is falling, the
  abortion ratio of 241 per 1,000 live births and abortion rate of 15 per 1,000 women
  aged 15–44 remain higher than those of most Western nations.[267] In 2013, the average
  age at first birth was 26 and 40.6% of births were to unmarried women.[268]The total
  fertility rate (TFR) was estimated for 2013 at 1.86 births per woman.[269]Adoption
  in the United States is common and relatively easy from a legal point of view (compared
  to other Western countries).[270] In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the U.S.
  accounted for nearly half of the total number of adoptions worldwide.[271] It is
  legal for same-sex couples to adopt. Polygamy is illegal throughout the U.S.[272]The
  United States is the world's oldest surviving federation. It is a constitutional
  republic and representative democracy, \"in which majority rule is tempered by minority
  rights protected by law\".[273] The government is regulated by a system of checks
  and balances defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme
  legal document.[274] For 2014, the U.S. ranked 19th on the Democracy Index[275]
  and 17th on the Corruption Perceptions Index.[276]In the American federalist system,
  citizens are usually subject to three levels of government: federal, state, and
  local. The local government's duties are commonly split between county and municipal
  governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected
  by a plurality vote of citizens by district. There is no proportional representation
  at the federal level, and it is rare at lower levels.[277]The federal government
  is composed of three branches:The House of Representatives has 435 voting members,
  each representing a congressional district for a two-year term. House seats are
  apportioned among the states by population every tenth year. At the 2010 census,
  seven states had the minimum of one representative, while California, the most populous
  state, had 53.[282]The Senate has 100 members with each state having two senators,
  elected at-large to six-year terms; one third of Senate seats are up for election
  every other year. The President serves a four-year term and may be elected to the
  office no more than twice. The President is not elected by direct vote, but by an
  indirect electoral college system in which the determining votes are apportioned
  to the states and the District of Columbia.[283] The Supreme Court, led by the Chief
  Justice of the United States, has nine members, who serve for life.[284]The state
  governments are structured in roughly similar fashion; Nebraska uniquely has a unicameral
  legislature.[285] The governor (chief executive) of each state is directly elected.
  Some state judges and cabinet officers are appointed by the governors of the respective
  states, while others are elected by popular vote.The original text of the Constitution
  establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its
  relationship with the individual states. Article One protects the right to the \"great
  writ\" of habeas corpus. The Constitution has been amended 27 times;[286] the first
  ten amendments, which make up the Bill of Rights, and the Fourteenth Amendment form
  the central basis of Americans' individual rights. All laws and governmental procedures
  are subject to judicial review and any law ruled by the courts to be in violation
  of the Constitution is voided. The principle of judicial review, not explicitly
  mentioned in the Constitution, was established by the Supreme Court in Marbury v.
  Madison (1803)[287] in a decision handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall.[288]The
  United States is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories
  and eleven uninhabited island possessions.[290] The states and territories are the
  principal administrative districts in the country. These are divided into subdivisions
  of counties and independent cities. The District of Columbia is a federal district
  which contains the capital of the United States, Washington DC.[291] The states
  and the District of Columbia choose the President of the United States. Each state
  has presidential electors equal to the number of their Representatives and Senators
  in Congress, the District of Columbia has three.[292]Congressional Districts are
  reapportioned among the states following each decennial Census of Population. Each
  state then draws single member districts to conform with the census apportionment.
  The total number of Representatives is 435, and delegate Members of Congress represent
  the District of Columbia and the five major US territories.[293]The United States
  also observes tribal sovereignty of the Native American nations. Though reservations
  are within state borders, the reservation is a sovereign entity. While the United
  States recognizes this sovereignty, other countries may not.[294]The United States
  has operated under a two-party system for most of its history.[295] For elective
  offices at most levels, state-administered primary elections choose the major party
  nominees for subsequent general elections. Since the general election of 1856, the
  major parties have been the Democratic Party, founded in 1824, and the Republican
  Party, founded in 1854. Since the Civil War, only one third-party presidential candidate—former
  president Theodore Roosevelt, running as a Progressive in 1912—has won as much as
  20% of the popular vote. The third-largest political party is the Libertarian Party.
  The President and Vice-president are elected through the Electoral College system.[296]Within
  American political culture, the Republican Party is considered \"conservative\"
  and the Democratic Party is considered \"liberal\".[297][disputed – discuss] The
  states of the Northeast and West Coast and some of the Great Lakes states, known
  as \"blue states\", are relatively liberal. The \"red states\" of the South and
  parts of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains are relatively conservative.The winner
  of the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, Democrat Barack Obama, is the 44th,
  and current, U.S. president. Current leadership in the Senate includes Democratic
  Vice President Joseph Biden, Republican President Pro Tempore (Pro Tem) Orrin Hatch,
  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Minority Leader Harry Reid.[298] Leadership
  in the House includes Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy,
  and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.[299]In the 114th United States Congress, both
  the House of Representatives and the Senate are controlled by the Republican Party.
  The Senate currently consists of 54 Republicans, and 44 Democrats with two independents
  who caucus with the Democrats; the House consists of 246 Republicans and 188 Democrats,
  with one vacancy.[300] In state governorships, there are 31 Republicans, 18 Democrats
  and one independent.[301] Among the DC mayor and the 5 territorial governors, there
  are 2 Republicans, 2 Democrats (one is also in the PPD), and 2 Independents.[302]The
  United States has an established structure of foreign relations. It is a permanent
  member of the United Nations Security Council, and New York City is home to the
  United Nations Headquarters. It is a member of the G7,[303]G20, and Organisation
  for Economic Co-operation and Development. Almost all countries have embassies in
  Washington, D.C., and many have consulates around the country. Likewise, nearly
  all nations host American diplomatic missions. However, Iran, North Korea, Bhutan,
  and the Republic of China (Taiwan) do not have formal diplomatic relations with
  the United States (although the U.S. still maintains relations with Taiwan and supplies
  it with military equipment).[304]The United States has a \"special relationship\"
  with the United Kingdom[305] and strong ties with Canada,[306]Australia,[307]New
  Zealand,[308]the Philippines,[309]Japan,[310]South Korea,[311]Israel,[312] and several
  European Union countries, including France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. It works
  closely with fellow NATO members on military and security issues and with its neighbors
  through the Organization of American States and free trade agreements such as the
  trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. In 2008,
  the United States spent a net $25.4 billion on official development assistance,
  the most in the world. As a share of America's large gross national income (GNI),
  however, the U.S. contribution of 0.18% ranked last among 22 donor states. By contrast,
  private overseas giving by Americans is relatively generous.[313]The U.S. exercises
  full international defense authority and responsibility for three sovereign nations
  through Compact of Free Association with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau,
  all of which are Pacific island nations which were part of the U.S.-administered
  Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands beginning after World War II, and gained
  independence in subsequent years.[314]Taxes are levied in the United States at the
  federal, state and local government level. These include taxes on income, payroll,
  property, sales, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. In 2010 taxes
  collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of GDP.[315]
  During FY2012, the federal government collected approximately $2.45 trillion in
  tax revenue, up $147 billion or 6% versus FY2011 revenues of $2.30 trillion. Primary
  receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,132B or 47%), Social Security/Social
  Insurance taxes ($845B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($242B or 10%).[316] Based on
  CBO Estimates,[317] under 2013 tax law the top 1% will be paying the highest average
  tax rates since 1979, while other income groups will remain at historic lows.[318]U.S.
  taxation is generally progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and is among
  the most progressive in the developed world.[319][320][321][322][323] The highest
  10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes,[324] and about half of all
  taxes.[325] Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no
  tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid
  on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains.[326][327] The historic
  reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs
  have not been viewed as welfare transfers.[328][329] However, according to the Congressional
  Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio
  ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest
  earning quintile, making the system progressive.[330]The top 10% paid 51.8% of total
  federal taxes in 2009, and the top 1%, with 13.4% of pre-tax national income, paid
  22.3% of federal taxes.[331] In 2013 the Tax Policy Center projected total federal
  effective tax rates of 35.5% for the top 1%, 27.2% for the top quintile, 13.8% for
  the middle quintile, and −2.7% for the bottom quintile.[332][333] The incidence
  of corporate income tax has been a matter of considerable ongoing controversy for
  decades.[322][334] State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive
  than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property
  taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams, though their consideration does
  not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.[322][335]During FY 2012,
  the federal government spent $3.54 trillion on a budget or cash basis, down $60
  billion or 1.7% vs. FY 2011 spending of $3.60 trillion. Major categories of FY 2012
  spending included: Medicare & Medicaid ($802B or 23% of spending), Social Security
  ($768B or 22%), Defense Department ($670B or 19%), non-defense discretionary ($615B
  or 17%), other mandatory ($461B or 13%) and interest ($223B or 6%).[316]The total
  national debt in the United States was $18.527 trillion (106% of the GDP), according
  to an estimate for 2014 by the International Monetary Fund.[336] In January 2015,
  U.S. federal government debt held by the public was approximately $13 trillion,
  or about 72% of U.S. GDP. Intra-governmental holdings stood at $5 trillion, giving
  a combined total debt of $18.080 trillion.[337][338] By 2012, total federal debt
  had surpassed 100% of U.S. GDP.[339] The U.S. has a credit rating of AA+ from Standard
  & Poor's, AAA from Fitch, and AAA from Moody's.[340]Historically, the U.S. public
  debt as a share of GDP increased during wars and recessions, and subsequently declined.
  For example, debt held by the public as a share of GDP peaked just after World War
  II (113% of GDP in 1945), but then fell over the following 30 years. In recent decades,
  large budget deficits and the resulting increases in debt have led to concern about
  the long-term sustainability of the federal government's fiscal policies.[341] However,
  these concerns are not universally shared.[342]The President holds the title of
  commander-in-chief of the nation's armed forces and appoints its leaders, the Secretary
  of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The United States Department of Defense
  administers the armed forces, including the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force.
  The Coast Guard is run by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and by
  the Department of the Navy during times of war. In 2008, the armed forces had 1.4
  million personnel on active duty. The Reserves and National Guard brought the total
  number of troops to 2.3 million. The Department of Defense also employed about 700,000
  civilians, not including contractors.[343]Military service is voluntary, though
  conscription may occur in wartime through the Selective Service System.[344] American
  forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Force's large fleet of transport aircraft,
  the Navy's 10 active aircraft carriers, and Marine expeditionary units at sea with
  the Navy's Atlantic and Pacific fleets. The military operates 865 bases and facilities
  abroad,[345] and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in
  25 foreign countries.[346]The military budget of the United States in 2011 was more
  than $700 billion, 41% of global military spending and equal to the next 14 largest
  national military expenditures combined. At 4.7% of GDP, the rate was the second-highest
  among the top 15 military spenders, after Saudi Arabia.[347] U.S. defense spending
  as a percentage of GDP ranked 23rd globally in 2012 according to the CIA.[348] Defense's
  share of U.S. spending has generally declined in recent decades, from Cold War peaks
  of 14.2% of GDP in 1953 and 69.5% of federal outlays in 1954 to 4.7% of GDP and
  18.8% of federal outlays in 2011.[349]The proposed base Department of Defense budget
  for 2012, $553 billion, was a 4.2% increase over 2011; an additional $118 billion
  was proposed for the military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.[350] The last American
  troops serving in Iraq departed in December 2011;[351] 4,484 service members were
  killed during the Iraq War.[352] Approximately 90,000 U.S. troops were serving in
  Afghanistan in April 2012;[353] by November 8, 2013 2,285 had been killed during
  the War in Afghanistan.[354]Law enforcement in the United States is primarily the
  responsibility of local police and sheriff's departments, with state police providing
  broader services. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is the largest in the
  country. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and
  the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, including protecting civil rights,
  national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws.[356]
  At the federal level and in almost every state, a legal system operates on a common
  law. State courts conduct most criminal trials; federal courts handle certain designated
  crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. Plea bargaining
  in the United States is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the
  country are settled by plea bargain rather than jury trial.[357]In 2012 there were
  4.7 murders per 100,000 persons in the United States, a 54% decline from the modern
  peak of 10.2 in 1980.[358] In 2001–2, the United States had above-average levels
  of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence compared to other
  developed nations.[359] A cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organization
  Mortality Database from 2003 showed that United States \"homicide rates were 6.9
  times higher than rates in the other high-income countries, driven by firearm homicide
  rates that were 19.5 times higher.\"[360][dated info]Gun ownership rights continue
  to be the subject of contentious political debate.From 1980 through 2008 males represented
  77% of homicide victims and 90% of offenders. Blacks committed 52.5% of all homicides
  during that span, at a rate almost eight times that of whites (\"whites\" includes
  most Hispanics), and were victimized at a rate six times that of whites. Most homicides
  were intraracial, with 93% of black victims killed by blacks and 84% of white victims
  killed by whites.[361] In 2012, Louisiana had the highest rate of murder and non-negligent
  manslaughter in the U.S., and New Hampshire the lowest.[362] The FBI's Uniform Crime
  Reports estimates that there were 3,246 violent and property crimes per 100,000
  residents in 2012, for a total of over 9 million total crimes.[363]Capital punishment
  is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and
  used in 31 states.[364][365] No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in
  part to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the death
  penalty. In 1976, that Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital
  punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there have been more
  than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas,
  Virginia, and Oklahoma.[366] Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or
  struck down death penalty laws. In 2014, the country had the fifth highest number
  of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq.[367]The
  United States has the highest documented incarceration rate and total prison population
  in the world.[368] At the start of 2008, more than 2.3 million people were incarcerated,
  more than one in every 100 adults.[369] At year end 2012, the combined U.S. adult
  correctional systems supervised about 6,937,600 offenders. About 1 in every 35 adult
  residents in the United States was under some form of correctional supervision at
  yearend 2012, the lowest rate observed since 1997.[370] The prison population has
  quadrupled since 1980.[371] However, the imprisonment rate for all prisoners sentenced
  to more than a year in state or federal facilities is 478 per 100,000 in 2013[372]
  and the rate for pre-trial/remand prisoners is 153 per 100,000 residents in 2012.[373]
  The country's high rate of incarceration is largely due to changes in sentencing
  guidelines and drug policies.[374] According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the
  majority of inmates held in federal prisons are convicted of drug offenses.[375]
  The privatization of prisons and prison services which began in the 1980s has been
  a subject of debate.[376][377] In 2008, Louisiana had the highest incarceration
  rate,[378] and Maine the lowest.[379]The United States has a capitalist mixed economy
  which is fueled by abundant natural resources and high productivity.[388] According
  to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. GDP of $16.8 trillion constitutes 24%
  of the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 19% of the gross world
  product at purchasing power parity (PPP).[389]The US's nominal GDP is estimated
  to be $17.528 trillion as of 2014[update][390] From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded
  annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of
  the G7.[391] The country ranks ninth in the world in nominal GDP per capita and
  sixth in GDP per capita at PPP.[389] The U.S. dollar is the world's primary reserve
  currency.[392]The United States is the largest importer of goods and second largest
  exporter, though exports per capita are relatively low. In 2010, the total U.S.
  trade deficit was $635 billion.[393] Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, and Germany are
  its top trading partners.[394] In 2010, oil was the largest import commodity, while
  transportation equipment was the country's largest export.[393] Japan is the largest
  foreign holder of U.S. public debt.[395] The largest holder of the U.S. debt are
  American entities, including federal government accounts and the Federal Reserve,
  who hold the majority of the debt.[396][397][398][399]The Stockholm International
  Peace Research Institute, SIPRI, found that the United States' arms industry was
  the world's biggest exporter of major weapons from 2005–2009,[400] and remained
  the largest exporter of major weapons during a period between 2010–2014, followed
  by Russia, China (PRC), and Germany.[401]In 2009, the private sector was estimated
  to constitute 86.4% of the economy, with federal government activity accounting
  for 4.3% and state and local government activity (including federal transfers) the
  remaining 9.3%.[402] The number of employees at all levels of government outnumber
  those in manufacturing by 1.7 to 1.[403] While its economy has reached a postindustrial
  level of development and its service sector constitutes 67.8% of GDP, the United
  States remains an industrial power.[404] The leading business field by gross business
  receipts is wholesale and retail trade; by net income it is manufacturing.[405]
  In the franchising business model, McDonald's and Subway are the two most recognized
  brands in the world. Coca-Cola is the most recognized soft drink company in the
  world.[406]Chemical products are the leading manufacturing field.[407] The United
  States is the largest producer of oil in the world, as well as its second largest
  importer.[408] It is the world's number one producer of electrical and nuclear energy,
  as well as liquid natural gas, sulfur, phosphates, and salt. The National Mining
  Association provides data pertaining to coal and minerals that include beryllium,
  copper, lead, magnesium, zinc, titanium and others.[409][410]Agriculture accounts
  for just under 1% of GDP,[404] yet the United States is the world's top producer
  of corn[411] and soybeans.[412] The National Agricultural Statistics Service maintains
  agricultural statistics for products that include peanuts, oats, rye, wheat, rice,
  cotton, corn, barley, hay, sunflowers, and oilseeds. In addition, the United States
  Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides livestock statistics regarding beef, poultry,
  pork, and dairy products. The country is the primary developer and grower of genetically
  modified food, representing half of the world's biotech crops.[413]Consumer spending
  comprises 68% of the U.S. economy in 2015.[414] In August 2010, the American labor
  force consisted of 154.1 million people. With 21.2 million people, government is
  the leading field of employment. The largest private employment sector is health
  care and social assistance, with 16.4 million people. About 12% of workers are unionized,
  compared to 30% in Western Europe.[415] The World Bank ranks the United States first
  in the ease of hiring and firing workers.[416] The United States is ranked among
  the top three in the Global Competitiveness Report as well. It has a smaller welfare
  state and redistributes less income through government action than European nations
  tend to.[417]The United States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee
  its workers paid vacation[418] and is one of just a few countries in the world without
  paid family leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname
  and Liberia.[419] However, 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave,
  according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers
  get the same benefits.[420] While federal law currently does not require sick leave,
  it's a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations.[420]
  In 2009, the United States had the third highest workforce productivity per person
  in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. It was fourth in productivity per hour,
  behind those two countries and the Netherlands.[421]The 2008–2012 global recession
  had a significant impact on the United States, with output still below potential
  according to the Congressional Budget Office.[422] It brought high unemployment
  (which has been decreasing but remains above pre-recession levels), along with low
  consumer confidence, the continuing decline in home values and increase in foreclosures
  and personal bankruptcies, an escalating federal debt crisis, inflation, and rising
  petroleum and food prices. There remains a record proportion of long-term unemployed,
  continued decreasing household income, and tax and federal budget increases.[423][424][425]Americans
  have the highest average household and employee income among OECD nations, and in
  2007 had the second highest median household income.[426][427] According to the
  Census Bureau real median household income was $50,502 in 2011, down from $51,144
  in 2010.[428] The Global Food Security Index ranked the U.S. number one for food
  affordability and overall food security in March 2013.[429] Americans on average
  have over twice as much living space per dwelling and per person as European Union
  residents, and more than every EU nation.[430] For 2013 the United Nations Development
  Programme ranked the United States 5th among 187 countries in its Human Development
  Index and 28th in its inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI).[431]There has been a widening
  gap between productivity and median incomes since the 1970s.[432] However, the gap
  between total compensation and productivity is not as wide because of increased
  employee benefits such as health insurance.[433] While inflation-adjusted (\"real\")
  household income had been increasing almost every year from 1947 to 1999, it has
  since been flat on balance and has even decreased recently.[434] According to Congressional
  Research Service, during this same period, immigration to the United States increased,
  while the lower 90% of tax filers incomes became stagnant, and eventually decreasing
  since 2000.[435] The rise in the share of total annual income received by the top
  1 percent, which has more than doubled from 9 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011,
  has had a significant impact on income inequality,[436] leaving the United States
  with one of the widest income distributions among OECD nations.[437] The post-recession
  income gains have been very uneven, with the top 1 percent capturing 95 percent
  of the income gains from 2009 to 2012.[438] The extent and relevance of income inequality
  is a matter of debate.[439][disputed – discuss][440]Wealth, like income and taxes,
  is highly concentrated; the richest 10% of the adult population possess 72% of the
  country's household wealth, while the bottom half claim only 2%.[441] Between June
  2007 and November 2008 the global recession led to falling asset prices around the
  world. Assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value.[442] Since
  peaking in the second quarter of 2007, household wealth was down $14 trillion, but
  has since increased $14 trillion over 2006 levels.[443][444] At the end of 2014,
  household debt amounted to $11.8 trillion,[445] down from $13.8 trillion at the
  end of 2008.[446]There were about 578,424 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons
  in the U.S. in January 2014, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter
  or transitional housing program.[447] In 2011 16.7 million children lived in food-insecure
  households, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 1.1% of U.S. children,
  or 845,000, saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns at some point during
  the year, and most cases were not chronic.[448] According to a 2014 report by the
  Census Bureau, one in five young adults lives in poverty today, up from one in seven
  in 1980.[449]American public education is operated by state and local governments,
  regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal
  grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of six
  or seven (generally, kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally
  bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow
  students to leave school at 16 or 17.[450]About 12% of children are enrolled in
  parochial or nonsectarian private schools. Just over 2% of children are homeschooled.[451]
  The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world, spending
  more than $11,000 per elementary student in 2010 and more than $12,000 per high
  school student.[452] Some 80% of U.S. college students attend public universities.[453]The
  United States has many competitive private and public institutions of higher education.
  The majority of world's top universities listed by different ranking organizations
  are in the US.[454][455][456] There are also local community colleges with generally
  more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition. Of Americans
  25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2%
  earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[457] The basic literacy
  rate is approximately 99%.[5][458] The United Nations assigns the United States
  an Education Index of 0.97, tying it for 12th in the world.[459]As for public expenditures
  on higher education, the U.S. trails some other OECD nations but spends more per
  student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and
  private spending.[452][460] As of 2012[update], student loan debt exceeded one trillion
  dollars, more than Americans owe on credit cards.[461]The United States is home
  to many cultures and a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values.[26][462]
  Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations,
  nearly all Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five
  centuries.[463] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived
  from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources,
  such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[26][464] More recent immigration
  from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been
  described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl in
  which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.[26]Core
  American culture was established by Protestant British colonists and shaped by the
  frontier settlement process, with the traits derived passed down to descendants
  and transmitted to immigrants through assimilation. Americans have traditionally
  been characterized by a strong work ethic, competitiveness, and individualism, as
  well as a unifying belief in an \"American creed\" emphasizing liberty, equality,
  private property, democracy, rule of law, and a preference for limited government.[465]
  Americans are extremely charitable by global standards. According to a 2006 British
  study, Americans gave 1.67% of GDP to charity, more than any other nation studied,
  more than twice the second place British figure of 0.73%, and around twelve times
  the French figure of 0.14%.[466][467]The American Dream, or the perception that
  Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[468]
  Whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate.[469][470][471][472][391][473]
  While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[474]
  scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes,
  affecting socialization, language, and values.[475] Americans' self-images, social
  viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an
  unusually close degree.[476] While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic
  achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.[477]Mainstream
  American cuisine is similar to that in other Western countries. Wheat is the primary
  cereal grain with about three-quarters of grain products made of wheat flour[478]
  and many dishes use indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet
  potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup which were consumed by Native Americans
  and early European settlers.[479] These home grown foods are part of a shared national
  menu on one of America's most popular holidays; Thanksgiving, when some Americans
  make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion.[480]Characteristic dishes such
  as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes
  of various immigrants. French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos,
  and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed.[482] Americans
  drink three times as much coffee as tea.[483] Marketing by U.S. industries is largely
  responsible for making orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages.[484][485]American
  eating habits owe a great deal to that of their British culinary roots with some
  variations. Although American lands could grow newer vegetables England could not,
  most colonists would not eat these new foods until accepted by Europeans.[486] Over
  time American foods changed to a point that food critic, John L. Hess stated in
  1972: \"Our founding fathers were as far superior to our present political leaders
  in the quality of their food as they were in the quality of their prose and intelligence\".[487]The
  American fast food industry, the world's largest,[488] pioneered the drive-through
  format in the 1940s.[489] Fast food consumption has sparked health concerns. During
  the 1980s and 1990s, Americans' caloric intake rose 24%;[482] frequent dining at
  fast food outlets is associated with what public health officials call the American
  \"obesity epidemic\".[490] Highly sweetened soft drinks are widely popular, and
  sugared beverages account for nine percent of American caloric intake.[491]In the
  18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues
  from Europe. Writers such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David
  Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th
  century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second
  half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now recognized
  as an essential American poet.[492] A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects
  of the national experience and character—such as Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851),
  Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great
  Gatsby (1925) and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird (1960)— may be dubbed the \"Great
  American Novel\".[493]Eleven U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature,
  most recently Toni Morrison in 1993. William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John
  Steinbeck are often named among the most influential writers of the 20th century.[494]
  Popular literary genres such as the Western and hardboiled crime fiction developed
  in the United States. The Beat Generation writers opened up new literary approaches,
  as have postmodernist authors such as John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, and Don DeLillo.[495]The
  transcendentalists, led by Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, established the first
  major American philosophical movement. After the Civil War, Charles Sanders Peirce
  and then William James and John Dewey were leaders in the development of pragmatism.
  In the 20th century, the work of W. V. O. Quine and Richard Rorty, and later Noam
  Chomsky, brought analytic philosophy to the fore of American philosophical academia.
  John Rawls and Robert Nozick led a revival of political philosophy. Cornel West
  and Judith Butler have led a continental tradition in American philosophical academia.
  Chicago school economists like Milton Friedman, James M. Buchanan, and Thomas Sowell
  have impacted various fields in social and political philosophy.[496][497]In the
  visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition
  of European naturalism. The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated.
  The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art,
  shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[498]Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden
  Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic
  movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning
  and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United
  States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American
  architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[499]One
  of the first major promoters of American theater was impresario P. T. Barnum, who
  began operating a lower Manhattan entertainment complex in 1841. The team of Harrigan
  and Hart produced a series of popular musical comedies in New York starting in the
  late 1870s. In the 20th century, the modern musical form emerged on Broadway; the
  songs of musical theater composers such as Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Stephen
  Sondheim have become pop standards. Playwright Eugene O'Neill won the Nobel literature
  prize in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple Pulitzer Prize winners
  Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, and August Wilson.[501]Though little known at
  the time, Charles Ives's work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S.
  composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell
  and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition.
  Aaron Copland and George Gershwin developed a new synthesis of popular and classical
  music. Choreographers Isadora Duncan and Martha Graham helped create modern dance,
  while George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins were leaders in 20th-century ballet.
  Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography,
  with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and Ansel
  Adams.[502]The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply
  influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European traditions.
  Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music
  were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was
  developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the
  20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the
  1940s.[503]Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock
  and roll. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of
  America's most celebrated songwriters and James Brown led the development of funk.
  More recent American creations include hip hop and house music. American pop stars
  such as Presley, Michael Jackson, and Madonna have become global celebrities,[503]
  as have contemporary musical artists such as Taylor Swift, Britney Spears, Katy
  Perry, and Beyoncé as well as hip hop artists Jay Z, Eminem and Kanye West.[504]
  Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing
  in worldwide sales.[505][506][507]Hollywood, a northern district of Los Angeles,
  California, is one of the leaders in motion picture production.[508] The world's
  first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using
  Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope.[509] The next year saw the first commercial screening
  of a projected film, also in New York, and the United States was in the forefront
  of sound film's development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century,
  the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although
  in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies
  have been subject to the forces of globalization.[510]Director D. W. Griffith, American's
  top filmmaker during the silent film period, was central to the development of film
  grammar, and producer/entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film
  and movie merchandising.[511] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of
  the American Old West and history, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened
  the possibilities of cinema with location shooting, with great influence on subsequent
  directors. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to
  as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\", from the early sound period until the early
  1960s,[512] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic
  figures.[513][514] In the 1970s, film directors such as Martin Scorsese, Francis
  Ford Coppola and Robert Altman were a vital component in what became known as \"New
  Hollywood\" or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\",[515] grittier films influenced by
  French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[516] Since, directors
  such as Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and James Cameron have gained renown for
  their blockbuster films, often characterized by high production costs, and in return,
  high earnings at the box office, with Cameron's Avatar (2009) earning more than
  $2 billion.[517]Notable films topping the American Film Institute's AFI 100 list
  include Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941), which is frequently cited as the greatest
  film of all time,[518][519]Casablanca (1942), The Godfather (1972), Gone with the
  Wind (1939), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), The Wizard of Oz (1939), The Graduate (1967),
  On the Waterfront (1954), Schindler's List (1993), Singin' in the Rain (1952), It's
  a Wonderful Life (1946) and Sunset Boulevard (1950).[520] The Academy Awards, popularly
  known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
  and Sciences since 1929,[521] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually
  since January 1944.[522]While most major U.S. sports have evolved out of European
  practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American
  inventions, some of which have become popular in other countries. Lacrosse and surfing
  arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact.[525]
  The Iroquois field their own separate national team, the Iroquois Nationals, in
  recognition of the confederacy's creation of lacrosse. Eight Olympic Games have
  taken place in the United States. The United States has won 2,400 medals at the
  Summer Olympic Games, more than any other country, and 281 in the Winter Olympic
  Games, the second most behind Norway.[526]The market for professional sports in
  the United States is roughly $69 billion, roughly 50% larger than that of all of
  Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[527]Baseball has been regarded as
  the national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball (MLB)
  being the top league, while American football is now by several measures the most
  popular spectator sport,[528] with the National Football League (NFL) having the
  highest average attendance of any sports league in the world and a Super Bowl watched
  by millions globally. Basketball and ice hockey are the country's next two leading
  professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association
  (NBA) and the National Hockey League (NHL). These four major sports, when played
  professionally, each occupy a season at different, but overlapping, times of the
  year. College football and basketball attract large audiences.[529]Boxing and horse
  racing were once the most watched individual sports,[530] but they have been eclipsed
  by golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR.[531] In the 21st century, televised
  mixed martial arts has also gained a strong following of regular viewers.[532][533]
  While soccer is less popular in the United States compared to many other nations,
  the country hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the men's national soccer team has been
  to the past six World Cups. The United States women's national soccer team won the
  women's world cup three times, highest in the world.[534]Major League Soccer is
  the professional soccer league in the United States.Personal transportation is dominated
  by automobiles, which operate on a network of 4 million miles of public roads,[536]
  including one of the world's longest highway systems at 57,000 miles.[537] The world's
  second largest automobile market,[538] the United States has the highest rate of
  per-capita vehicle ownership in the world, with 765 vehicles per 1,000 Americans.[539]
  About 40% of personal vehicles are vans, SUVs, or light trucks.[540] The average
  American adult (accounting for all drivers and non-drivers) spends 55 minutes driving
  every day, traveling 29 miles (47 km).[541]Mass transit accounts for 9% of total
  U.S. work trips.[542][543]Transport of goods by rail is extensive, though relatively
  low numbers of passengers (approximately 31 million annually) use intercity rail
  to travel, partly because of the low population density throughout much of the U.S.
  interior.[544][545] However, ridership on Amtrak, the national intercity passenger
  rail system, grew by almost 37% between 2000 and 2010.[546] Also, light rail development
  has increased in recent years.[547] Bicycle usage for work commutes is minimal.[548]The
  civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated
  since 1978, while most major airports are publicly owned.[549] The three largest
  airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is
  number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways.[550] Of the world's 30 busiest
  passenger airports, 12 are in the United States, including the busiest, Hartsfield–Jackson
  Atlanta International Airport.[551]The United States energy market is about 29,000
  terawatt hours per year.[552]Energy consumption per capita is 7.8 tons of oil equivalent
  per year, the 10th highest rate in the world. In 2005, 40% of this energy came from
  petroleum, 23% from coal, and 22% from natural gas. The remainder was supplied by
  nuclear power and renewable energy sources.[553] The United States is the world's
  largest consumer of petroleum.[554]For decades, nuclear power has played a limited
  role relative to many other developed countries, in part because of public perception
  in the wake of a 1979 accident. In 2007, several applications for new nuclear plants
  were filed.[555] The United States has 27% of global coal reserves.[556] It is the
  world's largest producer of natural gas and crude oil.[557]Issues that affect water
  supply and sanitation in the United States include water scarcity, pollution, a
  backlog of investment, concerns about the affordability of water for the poorest,
  and a rapidly retiring workforce. Increased variability and intensity of rainfall
  as a result of climate change is expected to produce both more severe droughts and
  flooding, with potentially serious consequences for water supply and for pollution
  from combined sewer overflows.[558][559] Droughts are likely to particularly affect
  the 66 percent of Americans whose communities depend on surface water.[560] As for
  drinking water quality, there are concerns about disinfection by-products, lead,
  perchlorates and pharmaceutical substances, but generally drinking water quality
  in the U.S. is good.[561]Cities, utilities, state governments and the federal government
  have addressed the above issues in various ways. To keep pace with demand from an
  increasing population, utilities traditionally have augmented supplies. However,
  faced with increasing costs and droughts, water conservation is beginning to receive
  more attention and is being supported through the federal WaterSense program. The
  reuse of treated wastewater for non-potable uses is also becoming increasingly common.
  Pollution through wastewater discharges, a major issue in the 1960s, has been brought
  largely under control.Most Americans are served by publicly owned water and sewer
  utilities. Eleven percent of Americans receive water from private (so-called \"investor-owned\")
  utilities. In rural areas, cooperatives often provide drinking water. Finally, up
  to 15 percent of Americans are served by their own wells.[562][563] Water supply
  and wastewater systems are regulated by state governments and the federal government.
  At the state level, health and environmental regulation is entrusted to the corresponding
  state-level departments. Public Utilities Commissions or Public Service Commissions
  regulate tariffs charged by private utilities. In some states they also regulate
  tariffs by public utilities. At the federal level, drinking water quality and wastewater
  discharges are regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, which
  also provides funding to utilities through State Revolving Funds.[564][565][566]Water
  consumption in the United States is more than double that in Central Europe, with
  large variations among the states. In 2002 the average American family spent $474
  on water and sewerage charges,[567] which is about the same level as in Europe.
  The median household spent about 1.1 percent of its income on water and sewerage.[568]The
  United States has been a leader in scientific research and technological innovation
  since the late 19th century. Methods for producing Interchangeable parts were developed
  by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories during the first half of the
  19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry,
  enabled the U.S. to have large scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles
  and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system
  of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction
  of the assembly line and other labor saving techniques created the system called
  mass production.[569]In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent
  for the telephone. Thomas Edison's research laboratory, one of the first of its
  kind, developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first
  viable movie camera.[570] The latter lead to emergence of the worldwide entertainment
  industry. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds
  and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The Wright brothers, in 1903, made
  the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.[571]The rise
  of Nazism in the 1930s led many European scientists, including Albert Einstein,
  Enrico Fermi, and John von Neumann, to immigrate to the United States.[572] During
  World War II, the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic
  Age, while the Space Race produced rapid advances in rocketry, materials science,
  and aeronautics.[573][574]The invention of the transistor in the 1950s, a key active
  component in practically all modern electronics, led to many technological developments
  and a significant expansion of the U.S. technology industry.[575][576][577] This
  in turn led to the establishment of many new technology companies and regions around
  the county such as Silicon Valley in California. Advancements by American microprocessor
  companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel along with both computer
  software and hardware companies that include Adobe Systems, Apple Computer, IBM,
  GNU-Linux, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems created and popularized the personal
  computer. The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department requirements,
  and became the first of a series of networks which evolved into the Internet.[578]These
  advancements then lead to greater personalization of technology for individual use.[579]
  As of 2013[update], 83.8% of American households owned at least one computer, and
  73.3% had high-speed Internet service.[580] 91% of Americans also own a mobile phone
  as of May 2013[update].[581] The United States ranks highly with regard to freedom
  of use of the internet.[582]In the 21st century, 64% of research and development
  funding comes from the private sector.[583] The United States leads the world in
  scientific research papers and impact factor.[584]The United States has a life expectancy
  of 79.8 years at birth, up from 75.2 years in 1990.[585][586][587] Increasing obesity
  in the United States and health improvements elsewhere have contributed to lowering
  the country's rank in life expectancy from 1987, when it was 11th in the world.[588]Obesity
  rates in the United States are amongst the highest in the world.[589]Approximately
  one-third of the adult population is obese and an additional third is overweight;[590]
  the obesity rate, the highest in the industrialized world, has more than doubled
  in the last quarter-century.[591] Obesity-related type 2 diabetes is considered
  epidemic by health care professionals.[592] The infant mortality rate of 6.17 per
  thousand places the United States 169th highest out of 224 countries, with the 224th
  country having the lowest mortality rate.[593]In 2010, coronary artery disease,
  lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic accidents
  caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal
  disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The
  most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood
  pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer's disease,
  drug abuse, kidney disease and cancer, and falls caused the most additional years
  of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.[587] U.S. teenage pregnancy
  and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other Western nations, especially
  among blacks and Hispanics.[594] U.S. underage drinking among teenagers is among
  the lowest in industrialized nations.[595]The U.S. is a global leader in medical
  innovation. America solely developed or contributed significantly to 9 of the top
  10 most important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by a 2001 poll of physicians,
  while the EU and Switzerland together contributed to five.[596] Since 1966, more
  Americans have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine than the rest of the world combined.
  From 1989 to 2002, four times more money was invested in private biotechnology companies
  in America than in Europe.[597] The U.S. health-care system far outspends any other
  nation, measured in both per capita spending and percentage of GDP.[598]Health-care
  coverage in the United States is a combination of public and private efforts and
  is not universal. In 2014, 13.4% of the population did not carry health insurance.[599]
  The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue.[600][601]
  In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance.[602]Federal
  legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health
  insurance system around the country by 2014, though the bill and its ultimate impact
  are issues of controversy.[603][604]The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are
  the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), the
  American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and Fox. The four major broadcast television
  networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels
  catering to a variety of niches.[605] Americans listen to radio programming, also
  largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day.[606]In 1998,
  the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and
  5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these
  stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes
  and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions and corporate underwriting.
  Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR (formerly National Public Radio).
  NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967;
  its television counterpart, PBS, was also created by the same legislation. (NPR
  and PBS are operated separately from each other.) As of September 30, 2014[update],
  there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the US according to the U.S.
  Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[607]Well-known newspapers are The New York
  Times, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal. Although the cost of publishing has
  increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing
  newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major
  wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world
  coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately
  owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or
  even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in
  a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities
  often have \"alternative weeklies\" to complement the mainstream daily papers, for
  example, New York City's The Village Voice or Los Angeles' LA Weekly, to name two
  of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade
  papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups.
  Early versions of the American newspaper comic strip and the American comic book
  began appearing in the 19th century. In 1938, Superman, the comic book superhero
  of DC Comics, developed into an American icon.[608] Aside from web portals and search
  engines, the most popular websites are Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Yahoo.com,
  eBay, Amazon and Twitter.[609]In Spanish, the second most widely spoken mother tongue
  behind English, more than 800 publications are published.[610][611]"
