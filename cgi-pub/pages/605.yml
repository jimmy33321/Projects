  \                   It was a relatively simple device that Jack\r\n                     Kilby
  showed to a handful of co-workers gathered in TI's \r\n                    semiconductor
  lab 50 years ago -- only a transistor \r\n                    and other components
  on a slice of germanium. Little did\r\n                     this  group of onlookers
  know, but Kilby's invention, 7/16-by-1/16-inches\r\n                     \r\n                    in
  size and called an integrated circuit, was about to revolutionize\r\n                      the
  electronics industry. \r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                  The
  Answer to a Problem\r\n                  It was in a relatively deserted laboratory
  at TI's brand \r\n                    new Semiconductor Building where Jack Kilby
  first hit on the \r\n                    idea of the integrated circuit. In July
  1958, when most employees \r\n                    left for the traditional two-week
  \r\n                    vacation period, Kilby -- as a new employee with no vacation
  \r\n                    -- stayed to man the shop. \r\n                   What caused
  Kilby to think along the lines that eventually \r\n                    resulted
  in the integrated circuit? Like many inventors, he \r\n                    set out
  to solve a problem. In this case, the problem was \r\n                    called
  \"the tyranny of numbers.\" \r\n                   For almost 50 years after the
  turn of the 20th century, \r\n                    the electronics industry had been
  dominated by vacuum tube \r\n                    technology. But vacuum tubes had
  inherent limitations. They \r\n                    were fragile, bulky, unreliable,
  power hungry, and produced \r\n                    considerable heat. \r\n                   It
  wasn't until 1947, with the invention of the transistor \r\n                    by
  Bell Telephone Laboratories, that the vacuum tube problem \r\n                    was
  solved. Transistors were miniscule in comparison, more \r\n                    reliable,
  longer lasting, produced less heat, and consumed \r\n                    less power.
  The transistor stimulated engineers to design \r\n                    ever more
  complex electronic circuits and equipment containing \r\n                    hundreds
  or thousands of discrete components such as transistors, \r\n                    diodes,
  rectifiers and capacitors. But the problem was that \r\n                    these
  components still had to be interconnected to form electronic \r\n                    circuits,
  and hand-soldering thousands of components to thousands \r\n                    of
  bits of wire was expensive and time-consuming. It was also \r\n                    unreliable;
  every soldered joint was a potential source of \r\n                    trouble.
  The challenge was to find cost-effective, reliable \r\n                    ways
  of producing these components and interconnecting them. \r\n                   One
  stab at a solution was the Micro-Module program, sponsored \r\n                    by
  the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The idea was to make all the \r\n                    components
  a uniform size and shape, with the wiring built \r\n                    into the
  components. The modules then could be snapped together \r\n                    to
  make circuits, eliminating the need for wiring the connections.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBack
  to Top \r\n                  Enter Kilby\r\n                  TI \r\n                    was
  working on the Micro-Module program when Kilby joined \r\n                    the
  company in 1958. Because of his work with Centralab in \r\n                    Milwaukee,
  Kilby was familiar with the \"tyranny of numbers\" \r\n                    problem
  facing the industry. But he didn't think the Micro-Module \r\n                    was
  the answer \x97 it didn't address the basic problem \r\n                    of large
  quantities of components in elaborate circuits.\r\n                    So Kilby
  began searching for an alternative, and in the process \r\n                    decided
  the only thing a semiconductor house could make cost \r\n                    effectively
  was a semiconductor. \"Further thought led me to \r\n                    the conclusion
  that semiconductors were all that were really \r\n                    required \x97
  that resistors and capacitors [passive devices], \r\n                    in particular,
  could be made from the same material as the \r\n                    active devices
  [transistors]. I also realized that, since \r\n                    all of the components
  could be made of a single material, \r\n                    they could also be made
  in situ interconnected to form a complete \r\n                    circuit,\" Kilby
  wrote in a 1976 article titled \"Invention \r\n                    of the IC.\"
  \r\n                   Kilby began to write down and sketch out his ideas in July
  \r\n                    of 1958. By September, he was ready to demonstrate a working
  \r\n                    integrated circuit built on a piece of semiconductor material.
  \r\n                    Several executives, including former TI Chairman Mark Shepherd,

  saw \r\n                    was a sliver of germanium, with protruding wires, glued
  to \r\n                    a glass slide. It was a rough device, but when Kilby
  pressed \r\n                    the switch, an unending sine curve undulated across
  the oscilloscope \r\n                    screen. His invention worked \x97 he had

  \                 Kilby had made a big breakthrough. But while the U.S. Air \r\n
  \                   Force showed some interest in TI's integrated circuit, industry
  \r\n                    reacted skeptically. Indeed the IC and its relative merits
  \r\n                    \"provided much of the entertainment at major technical
  meetings \r\n                    over the next few years,\" Kilby wrote. \r\n                   The
  \r\n                    integrated circuit first won a place in the military market
  \r\n                    through programs such as the first computer using silicon
  \r\n                    chips for the Air Force in 1961 and the Minuteman Missile
  \r\n                    in 1962. Recognizing the need for a \"demonstration product\"
  \r\n                    to speed widespread use of the IC, Patrick E. Haggerty,
  former \r\n                    TI chairman, challenged Kilby to design a calculator
  as powerful \r\n                    as the large, electro-mechanical desktop models
  of the day, \r\n                    but small enough to fit in a coat pocket. The
  resulting electronic \r\n                    hand-held calculator, of which Kilby
  is a co-inventor, successfully \r\n                    commercialized the integrated
  circuit.\r\n                  Back to Top\r\n\t\t\t\t  Impact\r\n                  The
  impact of Kilby's tiny chip has been far-reaching. Many \r\n                    of
  the electronics products of today could not have been developed \r\n                    without
  it. The chip virtually created the modern computer \r\n                    industry,
  transforming yesterday's room-size machines into \r\n                    today's
  array of mainframes, minicomputers and personal computers. \r\n                  \r\n
  \                  The chip restructured communications, fostering a host of \r\n
  \                   new ways for instant exchanges of information between people,
  \r\n                    businesses and nations.\r\n                  Without the
  chip, man could not explore space or fly to \r\n                      the moon.
  \r\n                    The chip helps the deaf to hear and is the heartbeat of
  \r\n                      a myriad of medical diagnostic machines. \r\n                    The
  chip has also touched education, transportation, manufacturing \r\n                      and
  entertainment. \r\n                   For Texas Instruments, the integrated circuit
  has played a \r\n                  pivotal role. Over the years, the company has
  produced billions \r\n                  of chips. But the integrated circuit has
  done more than help \r\n                  grow TI. It has enabled an entire industry
  to grow. Since 1961, \r\n                  the worldwide electronics market has
  grown from $29 billion \r\n                  to nearly $1,500 billion.\r\n                 This
  growth will depend on the continued development of newer \r\n                  and
  better technologies -- like those being developed at Texas \r\n                  Instruments.\r\n

  \         The Answer to a Problem | Enter \r\n            Kilby | Early Successes
  | Impact \r\n            | Toward the Future \r\n                    It was a relatively
  simple device that Jack\r\n                     Kilby showed to a handful of co-workers
  gathered in TI's \r\n                    semiconductor lab 50 years ago -- only
  a transistor \r\n                    and other components on a slice of germanium.
  Little did\r\n                     this  group of onlookers know, but Kilby's invention,
  7/16-by-1/16-inches\r\n                     \r\n                    in size and
  called an integrated circuit, was about to revolutionize\r\n                      the
  electronics industry. \r\n                    \r\n                  It was in a
  relatively deserted laboratory at TI's brand \r\n                    new Semiconductor
  Building where Jack Kilby first hit on the \r\n                    idea of the integrated
  circuit. In July 1958, when most employees \r\n                    left for the
  traditional two-week \r\n                    vacation period, Kilby -- as a new
  employee with no vacation \r\n                    -- stayed to man the shop.  What
  caused Kilby to think along the lines that eventually \r\n                    resulted
  in the integrated circuit? Like many inventors, he \r\n                    set out
  to solve a problem. In this case, the problem was \r\n                    called
  \"the tyranny of numbers.\" \r\n                   For almost 50 years after the
  turn of the 20th century, \r\n                    the electronics industry had been
  dominated by vacuum tube \r\n                    technology. But vacuum tubes had
  inherent limitations. They \r\n                    were fragile, bulky, unreliable,
  power hungry, and produced \r\n                    considerable heat. \r\n                   It
  wasn't until 1947, with the invention of the transistor \r\n                    by
  Bell Telephone Laboratories, that the vacuum tube problem \r\n                    was
  solved. Transistors were miniscule in comparison, more \r\n                    reliable,
  longer lasting, produced less heat, and consumed \r\n                    less power.
  The transistor stimulated engineers to design \r\n                    ever more
  complex electronic circuits and equipment containing \r\n                    hundreds
  or thousands of discrete components such as transistors, \r\n                    diodes,
  rectifiers and capacitors. But the problem was that \r\n                    these
  components still had to be interconnected to form electronic \r\n                    circuits,
  and hand-soldering thousands of components to thousands \r\n                    of
  bits of wire was expensive and time-consuming. It was also \r\n                    unreliable;
  every soldered joint was a potential source of \r\n                    trouble.
  The challenge was to find cost-effective, reliable \r\n                    ways
  of producing these components and interconnecting them. \r\n                   One
  stab at a solution was the Micro-Module program, sponsored \r\n                    by
  the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The idea was to make all the \r\n                    components
  a uniform size and shape, with the wiring built \r\n                    into the
  components. The modules then could be snapped together \r\n                    to
  make circuits, eliminating the need for wiring the connections.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBack
  to TopTI \r\n                    was working on the Micro-Module program when Kilby
  joined \r\n                    the company in 1958. Because of his work with Centralab
  in \r\n                    Milwaukee, Kilby was familiar with the \"tyranny of numbers\"
  \r\n                    problem facing the industry. But he didn't think the Micro-Module
  \r\n                    was the answer \x97 it didn't address the basic problem
  \r\n                    of large quantities of components in elaborate circuits.\r\n
  \                   So Kilby began searching for an alternative, and in the process
  \r\n                    decided the only thing a semiconductor house could make
  cost \r\n                    effectively was a semiconductor. \"Further thought
  led me to \r\n                    the conclusion that semiconductors were all that
  were really \r\n                    required \x97 that resistors and capacitors
  [passive devices], \r\n                    in particular, could be made from the
  same material as the \r\n                    active devices [transistors]. I also
  realized that, since \r\n                    all of the components could be made
  of a single material, \r\n                    they could also be made in situ interconnected
  to form a complete \r\n                    circuit,\" Kilby wrote in a 1976 article
  titled \"Invention \r\n                    of the IC.\" \r\n                   Kilby
  began to write down and sketch out his ideas in July \r\n                    of
  1958. By September, he was ready to demonstrate a working \r\n                    integrated
  circuit built on a piece of semiconductor material. \r\n                    Several
  executives, including former TI Chairman Mark Shepherd, \r\n                    gathered
  for the event on September 12, 1958. What they saw \r\n                    was a

  switch, an unending sine curve undulated across the oscilloscope \r\n                    screen.
