                  ANTHROPOMORPHISMIN SCIENCE
- |2
                  Anthropomorphism is an inveterate tendency to pro- ject human qualities into natural
- |2
                      phenomena— consciously or not. The standard and most
- |2
                      important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in
- |2
                      everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in
- |2
                      the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually
- |2
                      neglected logical aspects of the idea.
- |2
                  First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know
- |2
                      humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities
- |2
                      to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we know of human beings, but what we assume
- |2
                      to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may
- |2
                      go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls.
- |2
                      At the very least, we may leave the question, “Do human
- |2
                      souls exist?” open, and still speak of animism as based on
- |2
                      an analogy—not so much from known human qualities to unknown
- |2
                      natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.
- |2
                  The second characteristic of anthropomorphism in need of critical attention
- |2
                      is one related to the “genetic fallacy.” When we make
- |2
                      an anthropomorphic assump- tion, the
- |2
                      assumption may be true or false; it is not decisive to show that it is
- |2
                      anthropomorphic, just as it is no criticism of any idea to point to its
- |2
                      origins. Some anthropomorphic assumptions are known to be false, but
- |2
                      not simply because they are anthropomorphic, since other assumptions, e.g.,
- |2
                      that animals behave like humans in certain respects, may indeed be anthro-088
- "                    \n"
- |2
                      pomorphic and yet true. Nevertheless, it is assumed by and
- |2
                      large that when we make an anthropomorphic assumption, it is not likely to
- |2
                      be true. This, however, may rest on a more general situation, in which
- |2
                      any guess—whether based on analogy or not—is not
- |2
                      very likely to be true simply as a guess. If we want our guesses to be
- |2
                      more likely than wild fancies, we may suggest a theory concerning the
- |2
                      increase of the likeli- hood of a priori guesses. But then, this theory may be false
- |2
                      as well. And therefore we have, at least for the time being, to leave open
- |2
                      the question “Are any an-
- |2
                          thropomorphic assumptions true?” Nevertheless, on
- |2
                      different grounds we may suggest that practically all anthropomorphic
- |2
                      assumptions are likely to be false. The reason is very simple. Looking at
- |2
                      the history of culture, we can see that the deeper we go into the
- |2
                      past, the more likely we are to find anthropomor- phisms; and the nearer we come to our era, the
- |2
                      less anthropomorphic our theories become. We also know that the deeper
- |2
                      we go into the past, the more likely we are to find erroneous views, or at
- |2
                      least, views we consider erroneous today. For this historical reason,
- |2
                      we may claim that by and large, anthropomorphism is
- |2
                      “out.” The question which this approach raises, of
- |2
                      course, is “Is there some fundamental defect in anthro- pomorphism?”
- |2
                  This leads us to the third point. We know certainly that some
- |2
                      anthropomorphisms are based on false as-
- |2
                      sumptions (or at least on views which are unacceptable to
- |2
                      us)—indeed often one false assumption may generate quite a few
- |2
                      analogies. We speak pejoratively of an-
- |2
                          thropomorphic analogies which present no problems to us because
- |2
                      they depend on unacceptable assump- tions.
- |2
                      The most prominent example is anthro-
- |2
                          pocentrism, namely, the idea that the universe is cre- ated for the benefit of man and, therefore, may be
- |2
                      judged from the viewpoint of its utility to man. For instance, the essence
- |2
                      of wood, Aristotle suggests in hisPhysics, is that it is floatable and combustible, for
- |2
                      the obvious reason that the most important functions that wood played
- |2
                      in the ancient world were in its use as material for ship-building and as
- |2
                      fuel. One may won- der, were Aristotle living
- |2
                      today, whether he would make the essence of wood reside in its capability
- |2
                      of becoming printing paper. A similar criticism of Aris- totle is actually to be found in the late
- |2
                      Renaissance and the seventeenth century; for instance, in the works of
- |2
                      Robert Boyle, who suggested the following observa-
- |2
                          tion: for many people the essence of ice is that it is meltable
- |2
                      into water, and thus, in essence, is water; whereas, for doctors, who use
- |2
                      ice for lowering temper- atures, the
- |2
                      essence of water may be that it is freezable into ice.
- |2
                  The criticism made thus far of anthropocentrism, is,
- |2
                       of course, not decisive. It is quite possible to claim that
- |2
                      though it is an error to judge wood, and ice, on the basis of their use to
- |2
                      mankind at present, we should judge the essence of wood or ice from the
- |2
                      viewpoint of mankind throughout the whole of human history. Perhaps it
- |2
                      is very difficult to find out the total possible uses of wood or ice to
- |2
                      mankind from its beginning to its end; but anthropocentrists might claim
- |2
                      that this is what science should be about—that science is
- |2
                      more difficult than Aristotle thought, precisely because sci- entific knowledge grows by attempting to
- |2
                      find out the uses of different natural things for mankind through all
- |2
                      the ages. It looks as if this generalized anthropo- centrism is merely an intellectual exercise, but one
- |2
                      may interpret instrumentalism in science as just that. In- strumentalists, however, will object.
- |2
                      Somehow, the evidence that anthropocentrism happened to be paro- chial in the past was taken as evidence
- |2
                      that anthro- pocentrism in any form
- |2
                      must be parochial; and paro- chialism, of
- |2
                      course, must be rejected.
- |2
                  We come, finally, to the fourth and last point about anthropomorphism.
- |2
                      Anthropomorphism may be viewed (rightly or wrongly) as a version of the
- |2
                          paro- chialism that Sir Francis Bacon
- |2
                      designated as the Idols of the Tribe and of the Cave. Parochialism is the
- |2
                          pro- jection of our present knowledge of
- |2
                      our limited envi- ronment into the whole
- |2
                      universe. Parochialism is also the idea the worm in the apple has, that the
- |2
                      whole world is an apple. And, of course, anthropomorphism may be
- |2
                      viewed as a version of parochialism in the sense that we are very close to
- |2
                      ourselves, and having some notions of our human traits, we generalize and
- |2
                      project them into the universe at large.
- |2
                  So we seem to have arrived at the final condem-
- |2
                          nation of anthropomorphism. Somehow, we all con- demn parochialism and we have the feeling that,
- |2
                      viewed historically, science on the whole aims to break down parochial
- |2
                      barriers, to give us a better view of the universe, rather than to
- |2
                      reinforce the views into which we are born or which are due to
- |2
                      space-time accidents of birth, and so forth. And in as much as
- |2
                      anthropomorphism is historically parochial, or has its roots historically
- |2
                      in parochial philosophy, this fact itself leaves no doubt that
- |2
                      anthropomorphism runs against the spirit of science, and that as such, it
- |2
                      condemns itself.
- |2
                  On the other hand, there is, no doubt, quite a differ-
- |2
                          ent aspect or positive value of anthropomorphism in the history
- |2
                      of science, which cannot be condemned as parochialism, viz., the human uses
- |2
                      of science. To take very simple and obvious examples, scientists have de- vised many sorts of machines that imitate
- |2
                      human oper- ations. This, at least in part,
- |2
                      is a technological matter of purely practical significance, interest, or
- |2
                      value. We089
- |2
                       all want to jettison as many of our human burdens as possible
- |2
                      with impunity; we try to dump them on ma-
- |2
                      chines. Thus engineers will apply science to the de- signing of machines to perform as accurately as
- |2
                      possible as many human functions as possible. One might say all this
- |2
                      technology is devoid of intellectual value. But this is only partly true.
- |2
                      There is much to be gained scientifically in the theories of
- |2
                      servo-mechanisms and “thinking machines” as they are
- |2
                      half-jokingly called: we do want to embody part of our views of our func- tions and of our thought-processes in the
- |2
                      observable operations of models, and thus form generalizations in a
- |2
                      more scientific and interesting manner. What we learn from these mechanical
- |2
                      models may then be used in research—say in biology.
- |2
                  Whether we try to apply our knowledge of machines to humans, or our
- |2
                      knowledge of humans to machines, there is in each case an
- |2
                      intellectual—even philo-
- |2
                      sophic—interest. We can give examples of both cases, and
- |2
                      show thereby that there are certain interactions between the human sciences
- |2
                      and nonhuman sciences, as well as between sciences and technologies,
- |2
                      which are very stimulating, very suggestive, intellectually very
- |2
                      fruitful—and thereby justifiable. Take examples of the
- |2
                      applications of scientific knowledge of the inani-
- |2
                          mate world to the animate world, to humans in partic- ular. Not only have scientists claimed in a
- |2
                      succession of hypotheses that the eye is the camera obscura, that the
- |2
                      eye is a (lensed) camera, but also that the eye is a television camera of
- |2
                      some sort. These are various physiological views of the function of the
- |2
                      eyes. We also attempt the opposite when we apply the theories that
- |2
                      were first created for explaining human phenom-
- |2
                      ena to the explanation of nonhuman phenomena; there is no reason to
- |2
                      discard such hypotheses just because of their anthropomorphic origin. To
- |2
                      give a simple example, and a very well-known one indeed, Darwin was
- |2
                      influenced by Malthus. Malthus wrote on economic competition and struggle
- |2
                      for food in limiting popula- tion growth, and
- |2
                      Darwin wrote on the origin of species and of biological ecology; nobody
- |2
                      ever dreamt of censuring Darwin just because he was indebted to
- |2
                      Malthus.
- |2
                  To give another simple example, perhaps more in-
- |2
                          tricate but more important in history, there is nothing more
- |2
                      evidently anthropomorphic than the ideas of attraction and repulsion, of
- |2
                      love and hate. The intro- duction of the
- |2
                      ideas of love and hate into physics by the Stoics, and in modern times by
- |2
                      William Gilbert in his De magnete (1600) and
- |2
                      by Sir Isaac Newton, is certainly not in itself condemnable. There is
- |2
                      even something very interesting in the further development of the
- |2
                      theory of love and hate, or attraction and repul-
- |2
                          sion, in the history of physics. When attraction and
- |2
                       repulsion appear together in Newton's Principia (1687), they are put together as a theory of force, and
- |2
                      the idea of force was considered at that time to be highly animistic.
- |2
                      Newton was criticized for his animism and for his occult qualities. He
- |2
                      insists in his Opticks (1704) that his theories are
- |2
                      proper rather than ad hoc
- |2
                      expla- nations, and true (because they
- |2
                      provide precise predic- tions), so that one
- |2
                      ought not complain about them even if they may need further explanation to
- |2
                      fit them into Cartesian philosophy.
- |2
                  Newton's theory of force was abstract—at least as compared to
- |2
                      ideas of force we employ when we speak of applying force to break through
- |2
                      locked doors, etc.—the force of the muscles, the actions of the
- |2
                          mus- cles, the disposition of the muscles to
- |2
                      act. James Clerk Maxwell, in his Treatise on Electricity
- |2
                          and Magnetism (1873), compared Faraday's tubes of force to
- |2
                      muscles. The tubes of force by which Faraday operated, how- ever abstract they were, had two qualities. They tend
- |2
                      to shorten and to become wider, in a manner very similar to that of a tube
- |2
                      of a muscle. So one can condone the criticism, launched against Faraday by
- |2
                      the Newtonians of the day, that his theory was very dis- tinctly anthropomorphic and less abstract than the
- |2
                      Newtonian theory. Indeed, those in the Newtonian camp (who were indulgent
- |2
                      towards Faraday), such as John Tyndall and H. L. F. von Helmholtz, stressed
- |2
                      the fact that they had no quarrel with Faraday's use of those concrete
- |2
                      images because of his “want of mathe-
- |2
                          matical culture”: people who were better versed in
- |2
                      mathematics than Faraday, it follows, need not use his anthropomorphic
- |2
                      analogy. This is why historically Maxwell's work was so important: he
- |2
                      translated Fara- day's images into a
- |2
                      mathematical language; even Tyndall was very impressed.
- |2
                  There is correspondence between Faraday and Tyndall published in the Philosophical Magazine (1856), where Tyndall says to
- |2
                      Faraday that he cannot imagine how space, empty space, that is, can have
- |2
                      all these strange properties he ascribes to it, as it pulsates with
- |2
                      tensions and strains. Faraday answers Tyndall by de-
- |2
                          claring him to be unimaginative, and in need of a more developed
- |2
                      intuition.
- |2
                  In the history of science misplaced concreteness may have all sorts of
- |2
                      different manifestations. We may fill space with a material
- |2
                      “ether” which will accommodate strains and stresses.
- |2
                      We may suggest that the world is simple because we prefer simplicity, or
- |2
                      economy of thought. We may suggest that science should be math- ematical since reality is mathematical
- |2
                      (Galileo: “The Book of Nature is written in geometrical
- |2
                      characters.”). We may suggest as a speculation that the world
- |2
                      is composed of fragmentary units of “atomic facts”
- |2
                          be- cause we state our information about the
- |2
                      world in090
- |2
                       fragmentary propositions. The picture theory of lan- guage is perhaps one of the most significant manifesta- tions of anthropomorphism
- |2
                      insofar as it imputes to reality the limitations of our mode of
- |2
                      representing it. It was crystallized in the twentieth century in the
- |2
                      early work of Ludwig Wittgenstein (Tractatus-Philosophicus, 1922), and, for a while, was also held
- |2
                      by Bertrand Russell.
- |2
                  Is anthropomorphism still alive? One aspect of an- thropomorphism is parochialism, and it is typical of
- |2
                      parochialism that its holders don't consider themselves parochial. That is
- |2
                      to say, we never know how parochial we are. We only know how parochial our
- |2
                      predecessors were in comparison with us. It is quite possible that we
- |2
                      still hold various versions of anthropomorphism that may be rejected by our
- |2
                      successors if they are to get rid of our errors and parochial limitations.
- |2
                  In spite of this caution, it is possible to explain a few facts about the
- |2
                      historical development of science as it moves away from anthropomorphism.
- |2
                      Examples have been given of interaction between ideas in the social
- |2
                      sciences and those in biology and physics. What is condemnable about
- |2
                      anthropomorphism is mainly its parochialism. Now it is very hard to draw a
- |2
                      very clear line between parochial and nonparochial anthropo- morphisms, because the main
- |2
                      feature of anthro- pomorphism is its
- |2
                      use of analogy from human phenom- ena to
- |2
                      nonhuman phenomena and the idea of analogy is often very vague. Let us go
- |2
                      back to the theory of space, pulsating with stresses and strains, which
- |2
                      is common to Faraday's view and to Einstein's in his theory of
- |2
                      relativity. It is very easy to suggest that however abstract the idea of
- |2
                      pulsating space is in comparison with the theory of the pulsating ether
- |2
                      in space, there still is an analogy between Einstein's space and any
- |2
                      piece of elastic material such as plain rubber. In other words, however
- |2
                      abstract our scientific ideas are, we can draw analogies between them and
- |2
                      more concrete ideas, and so we can claim that our ideas are always
- |2
                      lamentably concrete and parochial, that we are still rooted in our
- |2
                      space-time environment, in local contingent conditions, whether
- |2
                      physiological, biologi- cal, or social.
- |2
                  Although from time to time we may find analogies that are stimulating,
- |2
                      exciting, and interesting, the sub- stance of
- |2
                      scientific progress cannot be based on anal-
- |2
                      ogies to the given, but rather on novel ideas, on ever increasing
- |2
                      abstractions. This explains the situation that was alluded to early in this
- |2
                      discussion: historically, the more we go into the distant past, the more we
- |2
                      see anthropomorphism in more stark-naked versions. The progress of
- |2
                      science is a progress from the more imme-
- |2
                      diate, from the more parochial, to the more abstract, to the more
- |2
                      general. And this very increase of gen
- |2
                      erality and abstraction moves us away from anthro- pomorphism.
- |2
                  It is exactly this characteristic that explains why even our views of human
- |2
                      nature, whether psychological, anthropological, sociological, economical,
- |2
                      or any other, are increasingly less anthropomorphic, increasingly more
- |2
                      abstract. There are very well-known, clamorous protests about making the
- |2
                      science of men so abstract as to dehumanize it; for example, it is said
- |2
                      that econo- mists have defiled economics by
- |2
                      the invention of that monster, the economic man. There is, perhaps,
- |2
                      some truth in such claims, but there is also a Luddite attitude
- |2
                      lurking in them, to destroy what seems to threaten us. Once we realize that
- |2
                      anthropomorphism often takes the familiar and the comfortably acceptable to
- |2
                      be true, we see that anthropomorphism may be objectionable even in the
- |2
                      social sciences. Still, it is hard to speak against anthropomorphism in
- |2
                      human sciences; we do better to speak against parochialism.

               Dictionary of the History of IdeasAnthropomorphism is an inveterate tendency to pro- ject human qualities into natural
- |2
                      phenomena— consciously or not. The standard and most
- |2
                      important variant of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in
- |2
                      everything in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in
- |2
                      the history of science, let us consider a few important and usually
- |2
                      neglected logical aspects of the idea.First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature, we assume that we know
- |2
                      humans; that is to say, we make an analogy from known human qualities
- |2
                      to unknown natural qualities. However, it is not what we know of human beings, but what we assume

                      to be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may
- |2
                      go the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls.
- |2
                      At the very least, we may leave the question, “Do human
- |2
                      souls exist?” open, and still speak of animism as based on
- |2
                      an analogy—not so much from known human qualities to unknown
- |2
                      natural qualities, but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.The second characteristic of anthropomorphism in need of critical attention
- |2
                      is one related to the “genetic fallacy.” When we make
- |2
                      an anthropomorphic assump- tion, the
- |2
                      assumption may be true or false; it is not decisive to show that it is
- |2
                      anthropomorphic, just as it is no criticism of any idea to point to its
- |2
                      origins. Some anthropomorphic assumptions are known to be false, but
- |2
                      not simply because they are anthropomorphic, since other assumptions, e.g.,
- |2
                      that animals behave like humans in certain respects, may indeed be anthro-This leads us to the third point. We know certainly that some
- |2
                      anthropomorphisms are based on false as-
- |2
                      sumptions (or at least on views which are unacceptable to
- |2
                      us)—indeed often one false assumption may generate quite a few
- |2
                      analogies. We speak pejoratively of an-
- |2
                          thropomorphic analogies which present no problems to us because
- |2
                      they depend on unacceptable assump- tions.
- |2
                      The most prominent example is anthro-
- |2
                          pocentrism, namely, the idea that the universe is cre- ated for the benefit of man and, therefore, may be
- |2
                      judged from the viewpoint of its utility to man. For instance, the essence
- |2
                      of wood, Aristotle suggests in hisPhysics, is that it is floatable and combustible, for
- |2
                      the obvious reason that the most important functions that wood played
- |2
                      in the ancient world were in its use as material for ship-building and as
- |2
                      fuel. One may won- der, were Aristotle living
- |2
                      today, whether he would make the essence of wood reside in its capability
- |2
                      of becoming printing paper. A similar criticism of Aris- totle is actually to be found in the late
- |2
                      Renaissance and the seventeenth century; for instance, in the works of
- |2
                      Robert Boyle, who suggested the following observa-
- |2
                          tion: for many people the essence of ice is that it is meltable
- |2
                      into water, and thus, in essence, is water; whereas, for doctors, who use
- |2
                      ice for lowering temper- atures, the
- |2
                      essence of water may be that it is freezable into ice.The criticism made thus far of anthropocentrism, is,
- |2
                       of course, not decisive. It is quite possible to claim that
- |2
                      though it is an error to judge wood, and ice, on the basis of their use to
- |2
                      mankind at present, we should judge the essence of wood or ice from the
- |2
                      viewpoint of mankind throughout the whole of human history. Perhaps it
- |2
                      is very difficult to find out the total possible uses of wood or ice to
- |2
                      mankind from its beginning to its end; but anthropocentrists might claim
- |2
                      that this is what science should be about—that science is
- |2
                      more difficult than Aristotle thought, precisely because sci- entific knowledge grows by attempting to
- |2
                      find out the uses of different natural things for mankind through all
- |2
                      the ages. It looks as if this generalized anthropo- centrism is merely an intellectual exercise, but one
- |2
                      may interpret instrumentalism in science as just that. In- strumentalists, however, will object.
- |2
                      Somehow, the evidence that anthropocentrism happened to be paro- chial in the past was taken as evidence
- |2
                      that anthro- pocentrism in any form
- |2
                      must be parochial; and paro- chialism, of
- |2
                      course, must be rejected.We come, finally, to the fourth and last point about anthropomorphism.
- |2
                      Anthropomorphism may be viewed (rightly or wrongly) as a version of the
- |2
                          paro- chialism that Sir Francis Bacon
- |2
                      designated as the Idols of the Tribe and of the Cave. Parochialism is the
- |2
                          pro- jection of our present knowledge of
- |2
                      our limited envi- ronment into the whole
- |2
                      universe. Parochialism is also the idea the worm in the apple has, that the
- |2
                      whole world is an apple. And, of course, anthropomorphism may be
- |2
                      viewed as a version of parochialism in the sense that we are very close to
- |2
                      ourselves, and having some notions of our human traits, we generalize and
- |2
                      project them into the universe at large.So we seem to have arrived at the final condem-
- |2
                          nation of anthropomorphism. Somehow, we all con- demn parochialism and we have the feeling that,
- |2
                      viewed historically, science on the whole aims to break down parochial
- |2
                      barriers, to give us a better view of the universe, rather than to
- |2
                      reinforce the views into which we are born or which are due to
- |2
                      space-time accidents of birth, and so forth. And in as much as
- |2
                      anthropomorphism is historically parochial, or has its roots historically
- |2
                      in parochial philosophy, this fact itself leaves no doubt that
- |2
                      anthropomorphism runs against the spirit of science, and that as such, it
- |2
                      condemns itself.On the other hand, there is, no doubt, quite a differ-
- |2
                          ent aspect or positive value of anthropomorphism in the history
- |2
                      of science, which cannot be condemned as parochialism, viz., the human uses
- |2
                      of science. To take very simple and obvious examples, scientists have de- vised many sorts of machines that imitate
- |2
                      human oper- ations. This, at least in part,
- |2
                      is a technological matter of purely practical significance, interest, or
- |2
                      value. WeWhether we try to apply our knowledge of machines to humans, or our
- |2
                      knowledge of humans to machines, there is in each case an
- |2
                      intellectual—even philo-
- |2
                      sophic—interest. We can give examples of both cases, and
- |2
                      show thereby that there are certain interactions between the human sciences
- |2
                      and nonhuman sciences, as well as between sciences and technologies,
- |2
                      which are very stimulating, very suggestive, intellectually very
- |2
                      fruitful—and thereby justifiable. Take examples of the
- |2
                      applications of scientific knowledge of the inani-
- |2
                          mate world to the animate world, to humans in partic- ular. Not only have scientists claimed in a
- |2
                      succession of hypotheses that the eye is the camera obscura, that the
- |2
                      eye is a (lensed) camera, but also that the eye is a television camera of
- |2
                      some sort. These are various physiological views of the function of the
- |2
                      eyes. We also attempt the opposite when we apply the theories that
- |2
                      were first created for explaining human phenom-
- |2
                      ena to the explanation of nonhuman phenomena; there is no reason to
- |2
                      discard such hypotheses just because of their anthropomorphic origin. To
- |2
                      give a simple example, and a very well-known one indeed, Darwin was
- |2
                      influenced by Malthus. Malthus wrote on economic competition and struggle
- |2
                      for food in limiting popula- tion growth, and
- |2
                      Darwin wrote on the origin of species and of biological ecology; nobody
- |2
                      ever dreamt of censuring Darwin just because he was indebted to
- |2
                      Malthus.To give another simple example, perhaps more in-
- |2
                          tricate but more important in history, there is nothing more
- |2
                      evidently anthropomorphic than the ideas of attraction and repulsion, of
- |2
                      love and hate. The intro- duction of the
- |2
                      ideas of love and hate into physics by the Stoics, and in modern times by
- |2
                      William Gilbert in his De magnete (1600) and
- |2
                      by Sir Isaac Newton, is certainly not in itself condemnable. There is
- |2
                      even something very interesting in the further development of the
- |2
                      theory of love and hate, or attraction and repul-
- |2
                          sion, in the history of physics. When attraction and
- |2
                       repulsion appear together in Newton's Principia (1687), they are put together as a theory of force, and
- |2
                      the idea of force was considered at that time to be highly animistic.
- |2
                      Newton was criticized for his animism and for his occult qualities. He
- |2
                      insists in his Opticks (1704) that his theories are
- |2
                      proper rather than ad hoc
- |2
                      expla- nations, and true (because they
- |2
                      provide precise predic- tions), so that one
- |2
                      ought not complain about them even if they may need further explanation to
- |2
                      fit them into Cartesian philosophy.Newton's theory of force was abstract—at least as compared to
- |2
                      ideas of force we employ when we speak of applying force to break through
- |2
                      locked doors, etc.—the force of the muscles, the actions of the
- |2
                          mus- cles, the disposition of the muscles to
- |2
                      act. James Clerk Maxwell, in his Treatise on Electricity
- |2
                          and Magnetism (1873), compared Faraday's tubes of force to
- |2
                      muscles. The tubes of force by which Faraday operated, how- ever abstract they were, had two qualities. They tend
- |2
                      to shorten and to become wider, in a manner very similar to that of a tube
- |2
                      of a muscle. So one can condone the criticism, launched against Faraday by
- |2
                      the Newtonians of the day, that his theory was very dis- tinctly anthropomorphic and less abstract than the
- |2
                      Newtonian theory. Indeed, those in the Newtonian camp (who were indulgent
- |2
                      towards Faraday), such as John Tyndall and H. L. F. von Helmholtz, stressed
- |2
                      the fact that they had no quarrel with Faraday's use of those concrete
- |2
                      images because of his “want of mathe-
- |2
                          matical culture”: people who were better versed in
- |2
                      mathematics than Faraday, it follows, need not use his anthropomorphic
- |2
                      analogy. This is why historically Maxwell's work was so important: he
- |2
                      translated Fara- day's images into a
- |2
                      mathematical language; even Tyndall was very impressed.There is correspondence between Faraday and Tyndall published in the Philosophical Magazine (1856), where Tyndall says to
- |2
                      Faraday that he cannot imagine how space, empty space, that is, can have
- |2
                      all these strange properties he ascribes to it, as it pulsates with
- |2
                      tensions and strains. Faraday answers Tyndall by de-
- |2
                          claring him to be unimaginative, and in need of a more developed
- |2
                      intuition.In the history of science misplaced concreteness may have all sorts of
- |2
                      different manifestations. We may fill space with a material
- |2
                      “ether” which will accommodate strains and stresses.
- |2
                      We may suggest that the world is simple because we prefer simplicity, or
- |2
                      economy of thought. We may suggest that science should be math- ematical since reality is mathematical
- |2
                      (Galileo: “The Book of Nature is written in geometrical
- |2
                      characters.”). We may suggest as a speculation that the world
- |2
                      is composed of fragmentary units of “atomic facts”
- |2
                          be- cause we state our information about the
- |2
                      world inIs anthropomorphism still alive? One aspect of an- thropomorphism is parochialism, and it is typical of
- |2
                      parochialism that its holders don't consider themselves parochial. That is
- |2
                      to say, we never know how parochial we are. We only know how parochial our
- |2
                      predecessors were in comparison with us. It is quite possible that we
- |2
                      still hold various versions of anthropomorphism that may be rejected by our
- |2
                      successors if they are to get rid of our errors and parochial limitations.In spite of this caution, it is possible to explain a few facts about the
- |2
                      historical development of science as it moves away from anthropomorphism.
- |2
                      Examples have been given of interaction between ideas in the social
- |2
                      sciences and those in biology and physics. What is condemnable about
- |2
                      anthropomorphism is mainly its parochialism. Now it is very hard to draw a
- |2
                      very clear line between parochial and nonparochial anthropo- morphisms, because the main
- |2
                      feature of anthro- pomorphism is its
- |2
                      use of analogy from human phenom- ena to
- |2
                      nonhuman phenomena and the idea of analogy is often very vague. Let us go
- |2
                      back to the theory of space, pulsating with stresses and strains, which
- |2
                      is common to Faraday's view and to Einstein's in his theory of
- |2
                      relativity. It is very easy to suggest that however abstract the idea of
- |2
                      pulsating space is in comparison with the theory of the pulsating ether
- |2
                      in space, there still is an analogy between Einstein's space and any
- |2
                      piece of elastic material such as plain rubber. In other words, however
- |2
                      abstract our scientific ideas are, we can draw analogies between them and
- |2
                      more concrete ideas, and so we can claim that our ideas are always
- |2
                      lamentably concrete and parochial, that we are still rooted in our
- |2
                      space-time environment, in local contingent conditions, whether
- |2
                      physiological, biologi- cal, or social.Although from time to time we may find analogies that are stimulating,
- |2
                      exciting, and interesting, the sub- stance of
- |2
                      scientific progress cannot be based on anal-
- |2
                      ogies to the given, but rather on novel ideas, on ever increasing
- |2
                      abstractions. This explains the situation that was alluded to early in this
- |2
                      discussion: historically, the more we go into the distant past, the more we
- |2
                      see anthropomorphism in more stark-naked versions. The progress of
- |2
                      science is a progress from the more imme-
- |2
                      diate, from the more parochial, to the more abstract, to the more
- |2
                      general. And this very increase of gen
- |2
                      erality and abstraction moves us away from anthro- pomorphism.It is exactly this characteristic that explains why even our views of human
- |2
                      nature, whether psychological, anthropological, sociological, economical,
- |2
                      or any other, are increasingly less anthropomorphic, increasingly more
- |2
                      abstract. There are very well-known, clamorous protests about making the
- |2
                      science of men so abstract as to dehumanize it; for example, it is said
- |2
                      that econo- mists have defiled economics by
- |2
                      the invention of that monster, the economic man. There is, perhaps,
- |2
                      some truth in such claims, but there is also a Luddite attitude
- |2
                      lurking in them, to destroy what seems to threaten us. Once we realize that
- |2
                      anthropomorphism often takes the familiar and the comfortably acceptable to
- |2

  \               ANTHROPOMORPHISMIN SCIENCE\n                Anthropomorphism is
  an inveterate tendency to pro- ject human qualities into natural\n                    phenomena—
  consciously or not. The standard and most\n                    important variant
  of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in\n                    everything
  in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in\n                    the
  history of science, let us consider a few important and usually\n                    neglected
  logical aspects of the idea.\n                First, when we draw an analogy from
  humans to nature, we assume that we know\n                    humans; that is to
  say, we make an analogy from known human qualities\n                    to unknown
  natural qualities. However, it is not what we know of human beings, but what we
  assume\n                    to be human that we read into nature. For all we know,
  the analogy may\n                    go the other way: like sticks and stones, human
  beings may not have souls.\n                    At the very least, we may leave
  the question, “Do human\n                    souls exist?” open, and still speak
  of animism as based on\n                    an analogy—not so much from known human
  qualities to unknown\n                    natural qualities, but from assumed human
  qualities to nonhuman qualities.\n                The second characteristic of anthropomorphism
  in need of critical attention\n                    is one related to the “genetic
  fallacy.” When we make\n                    an anthropomorphic assump- tion, the\n
  \                   assumption may be true or false; it is not decisive to show
  that it is\n                    anthropomorphic, just as it is no criticism of any
  idea to point to its\n                    origins. Some anthropomorphic assumptions
  are known to be false, but\n                    not simply because they are anthropomorphic,
  since other assumptions, e.g.,\n                    that animals behave like humans
  in certain respects, may indeed be anthro-088\n                    \n                    pomorphic
  and yet true. Nevertheless, it is assumed by and\n                    large that
  when we make an anthropomorphic assumption, it is not likely to\n                    be
  true. This, however, may rest on a more general situation, in which\n                    any
  guess—whether based on analogy or not—is not\n                    very likely to
  be true simply as a guess. If we want our guesses to be\n                    more
  likely than wild fancies, we may suggest a theory concerning the\n                    increase
  of the likeli- hood of a priori guesses. But then, this theory may be false\n                    as
  well. And therefore we have, at least for the time being, to leave open\n                    the
  question “Are any an-\n                        thropomorphic assumptions true?”
  Nevertheless, on\n                    different grounds we may suggest that practically
  all anthropomorphic\n                    assumptions are likely to be false. The
  reason is very simple. Looking at\n                    the history of culture, we
  can see that the deeper we go into the\n                    past, the more likely
  we are to find anthropomor- phisms; and the nearer we come to our era, the\n                    less
  anthropomorphic our theories become. We also know that the deeper\n                    we
  go into the past, the more likely we are to find erroneous views, or at\n                    least,
  views we consider erroneous today. For this historical reason,\n                    we
  may claim that by and large, anthropomorphism is\n                    “out.” The
  question which this approach raises, of\n                    course, is “Is there
  some fundamental defect in anthro- pomorphism?”\n                This leads us to
  the third point. We know certainly that some\n                    anthropomorphisms
  are based on false as-\n                    sumptions (or at least on views which
  are unacceptable to\n                    us)—indeed often one false assumption may
  generate quite a few\n                    analogies. We speak pejoratively of an-\n
  \                       thropomorphic analogies which present no problems to us
  because\n                    they depend on unacceptable assump- tions.\n                    The
  most prominent example is anthro-\n                        pocentrism, namely, the
  idea that the universe is cre- ated for the benefit of man and, therefore, may be\n
  \                   judged from the viewpoint of its utility to man. For instance,
  the essence\n                    of wood, Aristotle suggests in hisPhysics, is that
  it is floatable and combustible, for\n                    the obvious reason that
  the most important functions that wood played\n                    in the ancient
  world were in its use as material for ship-building and as\n                    fuel.
  One may won- der, were Aristotle living\n                    today, whether he would
  make the essence of wood reside in its capability\n                    of becoming
  printing paper. A similar criticism of Aris- totle is actually to be found in the
  late\n                    Renaissance and the seventeenth century; for instance,
  in the works of\n                    Robert Boyle, who suggested the following observa-\n
  \                       tion: for many people the essence of ice is that it is meltable\n
  \                   into water, and thus, in essence, is water; whereas, for doctors,
  who use\n                    ice for lowering temper- atures, the\n                    essence
  of water may be that it is freezable into ice.\n                The criticism made
  thus far of anthropocentrism, is,\n                     of course, not decisive.
  It is quite possible to claim that\n                    though it is an error to
  judge wood, and ice, on the basis of their use to\n                    mankind at
  present, we should judge the essence of wood or ice from the\n                    viewpoint
  of mankind throughout the whole of human history. Perhaps it\n                    is
  very difficult to find out the total possible uses of wood or ice to\n                    mankind
  from its beginning to its end; but anthropocentrists might claim\n                    that
  this is what science should be about—that science is\n                    more difficult
  than Aristotle thought, precisely because sci- entific knowledge grows by attempting
  to\n                    find out the uses of different natural things for mankind
  through all\n                    the ages. It looks as if this generalized anthropo-
  centrism is merely an intellectual exercise, but one\n                    may interpret
  instrumentalism in science as just that. In- strumentalists, however, will object.\n
  \                   Somehow, the evidence that anthropocentrism happened to be paro-
  chial in the past was taken as evidence\n                    that anthro- pocentrism
  in any form\n                    must be parochial; and paro- chialism, of\n                    course,
  must be rejected.\n                We come, finally, to the fourth and last point
  about anthropomorphism.\n                    Anthropomorphism may be viewed (rightly
  or wrongly) as a version of the\n                        paro- chialism that Sir
  Francis Bacon\n                    designated as the Idols of the Tribe and of the
  Cave. Parochialism is the\n                        pro- jection of our present knowledge
  of\n                    our limited envi- ronment into the whole\n                    universe.
  Parochialism is also the idea the worm in the apple has, that the\n                    whole
  world is an apple. And, of course, anthropomorphism may be\n                    viewed
  as a version of parochialism in the sense that we are very close to\n                    ourselves,
  and having some notions of our human traits, we generalize and\n                    project
  them into the universe at large.\n                So we seem to have arrived at
  the final condem-\n                        nation of anthropomorphism. Somehow,
  we all con- demn parochialism and we have the feeling that,\n                    viewed
  historically, science on the whole aims to break down parochial\n                    barriers,
  to give us a better view of the universe, rather than to\n                    reinforce
  the views into which we are born or which are due to\n                    space-time
  accidents of birth, and so forth. And in as much as\n                    anthropomorphism
  is historically parochial, or has its roots historically\n                    in
  parochial philosophy, this fact itself leaves no doubt that\n                    anthropomorphism
  runs against the spirit of science, and that as such, it\n                    condemns
  itself.\n                On the other hand, there is, no doubt, quite a differ-\n
  \                       ent aspect or positive value of anthropomorphism in the
  history\n                    of science, which cannot be condemned as parochialism,
  viz., the human uses\n                    of science. To take very simple and obvious
  examples, scientists have de- vised many sorts of machines that imitate\n                    human
  oper- ations. This, at least in part,\n                    is a technological matter
  of purely practical significance, interest, or\n                    value. We089\n
  \                    all want to jettison as many of our human burdens as possible\n
  \                   with impunity; we try to dump them on ma-\n                    chines.
  Thus engineers will apply science to the de- signing of machines to perform as accurately
  as\n                    possible as many human functions as possible. One might
  say all this\n                    technology is devoid of intellectual value. But
  this is only partly true.\n                    There is much to be gained scientifically
  in the theories of\n                    servo-mechanisms and “thinking machines”
  as they are\n                    half-jokingly called: we do want to embody part
  of our views of our func- tions and of our thought-processes in the\n                    observable
  operations of models, and thus form generalizations in a\n                    more
  scientific and interesting manner. What we learn from these mechanical\n                    models
  may then be used in research—say in biology.\n                Whether we try to
  apply our knowledge of machines to humans, or our\n                    knowledge
  of humans to machines, there is in each case an\n                    intellectual—even
  philo-\n                    sophic—interest. We can give examples of both cases,
  and\n                    show thereby that there are certain interactions between
  the human sciences\n                    and nonhuman sciences, as well as between
  sciences and technologies,\n                    which are very stimulating, very
  suggestive, intellectually very\n                    fruitful—and thereby justifiable.
  Take examples of the\n                    applications of scientific knowledge of
  the inani-\n                        mate world to the animate world, to humans in
  partic- ular. Not only have scientists claimed in a\n                    succession
  of hypotheses that the eye is the camera obscura, that the\n                    eye
  is a (lensed) camera, but also that the eye is a television camera of\n                    some
  sort. These are various physiological views of the function of the\n                    eyes.
  We also attempt the opposite when we apply the theories that\n                    were
  first created for explaining human phenom-\n                    ena to the explanation
  of nonhuman phenomena; there is no reason to\n                    discard such hypotheses
  just because of their anthropomorphic origin. To\n                    give a simple
  example, and a very well-known one indeed, Darwin was\n                    influenced
  by Malthus. Malthus wrote on economic competition and struggle\n                    for
  food in limiting popula- tion growth, and\n                    Darwin wrote on the
  origin of species and of biological ecology; nobody\n                    ever dreamt
  of censuring Darwin just because he was indebted to\n                    Malthus.\n
  \               To give another simple example, perhaps more in-\n                        tricate
  but more important in history, there is nothing more\n                    evidently
  anthropomorphic than the ideas of attraction and repulsion, of\n                    love
  and hate. The intro- duction of the\n                    ideas of love and hate
  into physics by the Stoics, and in modern times by\n                    William
  Gilbert in his De magnete (1600) and\n                    by Sir Isaac Newton, is
  certainly not in itself condemnable. There is\n                    even something
  very interesting in the further development of the\n                    theory of
  love and hate, or attraction and repul-\n                        sion, in the history
  of physics. When attraction and\n                     repulsion appear together
  in Newton's Principia (1687), they are put together as a theory of force, and\n
  \                   the idea of force was considered at that time to be highly animistic.\n
  \                   Newton was criticized for his animism and for his occult qualities.
  He\n                    insists in his Opticks (1704) that his theories are\n                    proper
  rather than ad hoc\n                    expla- nations, and true (because they\n
  \                   provide precise predic- tions), so that one\n                    ought
  not complain about them even if they may need further explanation to\n                    fit
  them into Cartesian philosophy.\n                Newton's theory of force was abstract—at
  least as compared to\n                    ideas of force we employ when we speak
  of applying force to break through\n                    locked doors, etc.—the force
  of the muscles, the actions of the\n                        mus- cles, the disposition
  of the muscles to\n                    act. James Clerk Maxwell, in his Treatise
  on Electricity\n                        and Magnetism (1873), compared Faraday's
  tubes of force to\n                    muscles. The tubes of force by which Faraday
  operated, how- ever abstract they were, had two qualities. They tend\n                    to
  shorten and to become wider, in a manner very similar to that of a tube\n                    of
  a muscle. So one can condone the criticism, launched against Faraday by\n                    the
  Newtonians of the day, that his theory was very dis- tinctly anthropomorphic and
  less abstract than the\n                    Newtonian theory. Indeed, those in the
  Newtonian camp (who were indulgent\n                    towards Faraday), such as
  John Tyndall and H. L. F. von Helmholtz, stressed\n                    the fact
  that they had no quarrel with Faraday's use of those concrete\n                    images
  because of his “want of mathe-\n                        matical culture”: people
  who were better versed in\n                    mathematics than Faraday, it follows,
  need not use his anthropomorphic\n                    analogy. This is why historically
  Maxwell's work was so important: he\n                    translated Fara- day's
  images into a\n                    mathematical language; even Tyndall was very
  impressed.\n                There is correspondence between Faraday and Tyndall
  published in the Philosophical Magazine (1856), where Tyndall says to\n                    Faraday
  that he cannot imagine how space, empty space, that is, can have\n                    all
  these strange properties he ascribes to it, as it pulsates with\n                    tensions
  and strains. Faraday answers Tyndall by de-\n                        claring him
  to be unimaginative, and in need of a more developed\n                    intuition.\n
  \               In the history of science misplaced concreteness may have all sorts
  of\n                    different manifestations. We may fill space with a material\n
  \                   “ether” which will accommodate strains and stresses.\n                    We
  may suggest that the world is simple because we prefer simplicity, or\n                    economy
  of thought. We may suggest that science should be math- ematical since reality is
  mathematical\n                    (Galileo: “The Book of Nature is written in geometrical\n
  \                   characters.”). We may suggest as a speculation that the world\n
  \                   is composed of fragmentary units of “atomic facts”\n                        be-
  cause we state our information about the\n                    world in090\n                     fragmentary
  propositions. The picture theory of lan- guage is perhaps one of the most significant
  manifesta- tions of anthropomorphism\n                    insofar as it imputes
  to reality the limitations of our mode of\n                    representing it.
  It was crystallized in the twentieth century in the\n                    early work
  of Ludwig Wittgenstein (Tractatus-Philosophicus, 1922), and, for a while, was also
  held\n                    by Bertrand Russell.\n                Is anthropomorphism
  still alive? One aspect of an- thropomorphism is parochialism, and it is typical
  of\n                    parochialism that its holders don't consider themselves
  parochial. That is\n                    to say, we never know how parochial we are.
  We only know how parochial our\n                    predecessors were in comparison
  with us. It is quite possible that we\n                    still hold various versions
  of anthropomorphism that may be rejected by our\n                    successors
  if they are to get rid of our errors and parochial limitations.\n                In
  spite of this caution, it is possible to explain a few facts about the\n                    historical
  development of science as it moves away from anthropomorphism.\n                    Examples
  have been given of interaction between ideas in the social\n                    sciences
  and those in biology and physics. What is condemnable about\n                    anthropomorphism
  is mainly its parochialism. Now it is very hard to draw a\n                    very
  clear line between parochial and nonparochial anthropo- morphisms, because the main\n
  \                   feature of anthro- pomorphism is its\n                    use
  of analogy from human phenom- ena to\n                    nonhuman phenomena and
  the idea of analogy is often very vague. Let us go\n                    back to
  the theory of space, pulsating with stresses and strains, which\n                    is
  common to Faraday's view and to Einstein's in his theory of\n                    relativity.
  It is very easy to suggest that however abstract the idea of\n                    pulsating
  space is in comparison with the theory of the pulsating ether\n                    in
  space, there still is an analogy between Einstein's space and any\n                    piece
  of elastic material such as plain rubber. In other words, however\n                    abstract
  our scientific ideas are, we can draw analogies between them and\n                    more
  concrete ideas, and so we can claim that our ideas are always\n                    lamentably
  concrete and parochial, that we are still rooted in our\n                    space-time
  environment, in local contingent conditions, whether\n                    physiological,
  biologi- cal, or social.\n                Although from time to time we may find
  analogies that are stimulating,\n                    exciting, and interesting,
  the sub- stance of\n                    scientific progress cannot be based on anal-\n
  \                   ogies to the given, but rather on novel ideas, on ever increasing\n
  \                   abstractions. This explains the situation that was alluded to
  early in this\n                    discussion: historically, the more we go into
  the distant past, the more we\n                    see anthropomorphism in more
  stark-naked versions. The progress of\n                    science is a progress
  from the more imme-\n                    diate, from the more parochial, to the
  more abstract, to the more\n                    general. And this very increase
  of gen\n                    erality and abstraction moves us away from anthro- pomorphism.\n
  \               It is exactly this characteristic that explains why even our views
  of human\n                    nature, whether psychological, anthropological, sociological,
  economical,\n                    or any other, are increasingly less anthropomorphic,
  increasingly more\n                    abstract. There are very well-known, clamorous
  protests about making the\n                    science of men so abstract as to
  dehumanize it; for example, it is said\n                    that econo- mists have
  defiled economics by\n                    the invention of that monster, the economic
  man. There is, perhaps,\n                    some truth in such claims, but there
  is also a Luddite attitude\n                    lurking in them, to destroy what
  seems to threaten us. Once we realize that\n                    anthropomorphism
  often takes the familiar and the comfortably acceptable to\n                    be
  true, we see that anthropomorphism may be objectionable even in the\n                    social
  sciences. Still, it is hard to speak against anthropomorphism in\n                    human
  sciences; we do better to speak against parochialism.\n                \n                    \n

  \               \n             Dictionary of the History of IdeasAnthropomorphism
  is an inveterate tendency to pro- ject human qualities into natural\n                    phenomena—
  consciously or not. The standard and most\n                    important variant
  of anthropomorphism is animism which sees a soul in\n                    everything
  in nature. Before entering into the role of anthropomorphism in\n                    the
  history of science, let us consider a few important and usually\n                    neglected
  logical aspects of the idea.First, when we draw an analogy from humans to nature,
  we assume that we know\n                    humans; that is to say, we make an analogy
  from known human qualities\n                    to unknown natural qualities. However,
  it is not what we know of human beings, but what we assume\n                    to
  be human that we read into nature. For all we know, the analogy may\n                    go
  the other way: like sticks and stones, human beings may not have souls.\n                    At
  the very least, we may leave the question, “Do human\n                    souls
  exist?” open, and still speak of animism as based on\n                    an analogy—not
  so much from known human qualities to unknown\n                    natural qualities,
  but from assumed human qualities to nonhuman qualities.The second characteristic
  of anthropomorphism in need of critical attention\n                    is one related
  to the “genetic fallacy.” When we make\n                    an anthropomorphic assump-
  tion, the\n                    assumption may be true or false; it is not decisive
  to show that it is\n                    anthropomorphic, just as it is no criticism
  of any idea to point to its\n                    origins. Some anthropomorphic assumptions
  are known to be false, but\n                    not simply because they are anthropomorphic,
  since other assumptions, e.g.,\n                    that animals behave like humans
  in certain respects, may indeed be anthro-This leads us to the third point. We know
  certainly that some\n                    anthropomorphisms are based on false as-\n
  \                   sumptions (or at least on views which are unacceptable to\n
  \                   us)—indeed often one false assumption may generate quite a few\n
  \                   analogies. We speak pejoratively of an-\n                        thropomorphic
  analogies which present no problems to us because\n                    they depend
  on unacceptable assump- tions.\n                    The most prominent example is
  anthro-\n                        pocentrism, namely, the idea that the universe
  is cre- ated for the benefit of man and, therefore, may be\n                    judged
  from the viewpoint of its utility to man. For instance, the essence\n                    of
  wood, Aristotle suggests in hisPhysics, is that it is floatable and combustible,
  for\n                    the obvious reason that the most important functions that
  wood played\n                    in the ancient world were in its use as material
  for ship-building and as\n                    fuel. One may won- der, were Aristotle
  living\n                    today, whether he would make the essence of wood reside
  in its capability\n                    of becoming printing paper. A similar criticism
  of Aris- totle is actually to be found in the late\n                    Renaissance
  and the seventeenth century; for instance, in the works of\n                    Robert
  Boyle, who suggested the following observa-\n                        tion: for many
  people the essence of ice is that it is meltable\n                    into water,
  and thus, in essence, is water; whereas, for doctors, who use\n                    ice
  for lowering temper- atures, the\n                    essence of water may be that
  it is freezable into ice.The criticism made thus far of anthropocentrism, is,\n
  \                    of course, not decisive. It is quite possible to claim that\n
  \                   though it is an error to judge wood, and ice, on the basis of
  their use to\n                    mankind at present, we should judge the essence
  of wood or ice from the\n                    viewpoint of mankind throughout the
  whole of human history. Perhaps it\n                    is very difficult to find
  out the total possible uses of wood or ice to\n                    mankind from
  its beginning to its end; but anthropocentrists might claim\n                    that
  this is what science should be about—that science is\n                    more difficult
  than Aristotle thought, precisely because sci- entific knowledge grows by attempting
  to\n                    find out the uses of different natural things for mankind
  through all\n                    the ages. It looks as if this generalized anthropo-
  centrism is merely an intellectual exercise, but one\n                    may interpret
  instrumentalism in science as just that. In- strumentalists, however, will object.\n
  \                   Somehow, the evidence that anthropocentrism happened to be paro-
  chial in the past was taken as evidence\n                    that anthro- pocentrism
  in any form\n                    must be parochial; and paro- chialism, of\n                    course,
  must be rejected.We come, finally, to the fourth and last point about anthropomorphism.\n
  \                   Anthropomorphism may be viewed (rightly or wrongly) as a version
  of the\n                        paro- chialism that Sir Francis Bacon\n                    designated
  as the Idols of the Tribe and of the Cave. Parochialism is the\n                        pro-
  jection of our present knowledge of\n                    our limited envi- ronment
  into the whole\n                    universe. Parochialism is also the idea the
  worm in the apple has, that the\n                    whole world is an apple. And,
  of course, anthropomorphism may be\n                    viewed as a version of parochialism
  in the sense that we are very close to\n                    ourselves, and having
  some notions of our human traits, we generalize and\n                    project
  them into the universe at large.So we seem to have arrived at the final condem-\n
  \                       nation of anthropomorphism. Somehow, we all con- demn parochialism
  and we have the feeling that,\n                    viewed historically, science
  on the whole aims to break down parochial\n                    barriers, to give
  us a better view of the universe, rather than to\n                    reinforce
  the views into which we are born or which are due to\n                    space-time
  accidents of birth, and so forth. And in as much as\n                    anthropomorphism
  is historically parochial, or has its roots historically\n                    in
  parochial philosophy, this fact itself leaves no doubt that\n                    anthropomorphism
  runs against the spirit of science, and that as such, it\n                    condemns
  itself.On the other hand, there is, no doubt, quite a differ-\n                        ent
  aspect or positive value of anthropomorphism in the history\n                    of
  science, which cannot be condemned as parochialism, viz., the human uses\n                    of
  science. To take very simple and obvious examples, scientists have de- vised many
  sorts of machines that imitate\n                    human oper- ations. This, at
  least in part,\n                    is a technological matter of purely practical
  significance, interest, or\n                    value. WeWhether we try to apply
  our knowledge of machines to humans, or our\n                    knowledge of humans
  to machines, there is in each case an\n                    intellectual—even philo-\n
  \                   sophic—interest. We can give examples of both cases, and\n                    show
  thereby that there are certain interactions between the human sciences\n                    and
  nonhuman sciences, as well as between sciences and technologies,\n                    which
  are very stimulating, very suggestive, intellectually very\n                    fruitful—and
  thereby justifiable. Take examples of the\n                    applications of scientific
  knowledge of the inani-\n                        mate world to the animate world,
  to humans in partic- ular. Not only have scientists claimed in a\n                    succession
  of hypotheses that the eye is the camera obscura, that the\n                    eye
  is a (lensed) camera, but also that the eye is a television camera of\n                    some
  sort. These are various physiological views of the function of the\n                    eyes.
  We also attempt the opposite when we apply the theories that\n                    were
  first created for explaining human phenom-\n                    ena to the explanation
  of nonhuman phenomena; there is no reason to\n                    discard such hypotheses
  just because of their anthropomorphic origin. To\n                    give a simple
  example, and a very well-known one indeed, Darwin was\n                    influenced
  by Malthus. Malthus wrote on economic competition and struggle\n                    for
  food in limiting popula- tion growth, and\n                    Darwin wrote on the
  origin of species and of biological ecology; nobody\n                    ever dreamt
  of censuring Darwin just because he was indebted to\n                    Malthus.To
  give another simple example, perhaps more in-\n                        tricate but
  more important in history, there is nothing more\n                    evidently
  anthropomorphic than the ideas of attraction and repulsion, of\n                    love
  and hate. The intro- duction of the\n                    ideas of love and hate
  into physics by the Stoics, and in modern times by\n                    William
  Gilbert in his De magnete (1600) and\n                    by Sir Isaac Newton, is
  certainly not in itself condemnable. There is\n                    even something
  very interesting in the further development of the\n                    theory of
  love and hate, or attraction and repul-\n                        sion, in the history
  of physics. When attraction and\n                     repulsion appear together
  in Newton's Principia (1687), they are put together as a theory of force, and\n
  \                   the idea of force was considered at that time to be highly animistic.\n
  \                   Newton was criticized for his animism and for his occult qualities.
  He\n                    insists in his Opticks (1704) that his theories are\n                    proper
  rather than ad hoc\n                    expla- nations, and true (because they\n
  \                   provide precise predic- tions), so that one\n                    ought
  not complain about them even if they may need further explanation to\n                    fit
  them into Cartesian philosophy.Newton's theory of force was abstract—at least as
  compared to\n                    ideas of force we employ when we speak of applying
  force to break through\n                    locked doors, etc.—the force of the
  muscles, the actions of the\n                        mus- cles, the disposition
  of the muscles to\n                    act. James Clerk Maxwell, in his Treatise
  on Electricity\n                        and Magnetism (1873), compared Faraday's
  tubes of force to\n                    muscles. The tubes of force by which Faraday
  operated, how- ever abstract they were, had two qualities. They tend\n                    to
  shorten and to become wider, in a manner very similar to that of a tube\n                    of
  a muscle. So one can condone the criticism, launched against Faraday by\n                    the
  Newtonians of the day, that his theory was very dis- tinctly anthropomorphic and
  less abstract than the\n                    Newtonian theory. Indeed, those in the
  Newtonian camp (who were indulgent\n                    towards Faraday), such as
  John Tyndall and H. L. F. von Helmholtz, stressed\n                    the fact
  that they had no quarrel with Faraday's use of those concrete\n                    images
  because of his “want of mathe-\n                        matical culture”: people
  who were better versed in\n                    mathematics than Faraday, it follows,
  need not use his anthropomorphic\n                    analogy. This is why historically
  Maxwell's work was so important: he\n                    translated Fara- day's
  images into a\n                    mathematical language; even Tyndall was very
  impressed.There is correspondence between Faraday and Tyndall published in the Philosophical
  Magazine (1856), where Tyndall says to\n                    Faraday that he cannot
  imagine how space, empty space, that is, can have\n                    all these
  strange properties he ascribes to it, as it pulsates with\n                    tensions
  and strains. Faraday answers Tyndall by de-\n                        claring him
  to be unimaginative, and in need of a more developed\n                    intuition.In
  the history of science misplaced concreteness may have all sorts of\n                    different
  manifestations. We may fill space with a material\n                    “ether” which
  will accommodate strains and stresses.\n                    We may suggest that
  the world is simple because we prefer simplicity, or\n                    economy
  of thought. We may suggest that science should be math- ematical since reality is
  mathematical\n                    (Galileo: “The Book of Nature is written in geometrical\n
  \                   characters.”). We may suggest as a speculation that the world\n
  \                   is composed of fragmentary units of “atomic facts”\n                        be-
  cause we state our information about the\n                    world inIs anthropomorphism
  still alive? One aspect of an- thropomorphism is parochialism, and it is typical
  of\n                    parochialism that its holders don't consider themselves
  parochial. That is\n                    to say, we never know how parochial we are.
  We only know how parochial our\n                    predecessors were in comparison
  with us. It is quite possible that we\n                    still hold various versions
  of anthropomorphism that may be rejected by our\n                    successors
  if they are to get rid of our errors and parochial limitations.In spite of this
  caution, it is possible to explain a few facts about the\n                    historical
  development of science as it moves away from anthropomorphism.\n                    Examples
  have been given of interaction between ideas in the social\n                    sciences
  and those in biology and physics. What is condemnable about\n                    anthropomorphism
  is mainly its parochialism. Now it is very hard to draw a\n                    very
  clear line between parochial and nonparochial anthropo- morphisms, because the main\n
  \                   feature of anthro- pomorphism is its\n                    use
  of analogy from human phenom- ena to\n                    nonhuman phenomena and
  the idea of analogy is often very vague. Let us go\n                    back to
  the theory of space, pulsating with stresses and strains, which\n                    is
  common to Faraday's view and to Einstein's in his theory of\n                    relativity.
  It is very easy to suggest that however abstract the idea of\n                    pulsating
  space is in comparison with the theory of the pulsating ether\n                    in
  space, there still is an analogy between Einstein's space and any\n                    piece
  of elastic material such as plain rubber. In other words, however\n                    abstract
  our scientific ideas are, we can draw analogies between them and\n                    more
  concrete ideas, and so we can claim that our ideas are always\n                    lamentably
  concrete and parochial, that we are still rooted in our\n                    space-time
  environment, in local contingent conditions, whether\n                    physiological,
  biologi- cal, or social.Although from time to time we may find analogies that are
  stimulating,\n                    exciting, and interesting, the sub- stance of\n
  \                   scientific progress cannot be based on anal-\n                    ogies
  to the given, but rather on novel ideas, on ever increasing\n                    abstractions.
  This explains the situation that was alluded to early in this\n                    discussion:
  historically, the more we go into the distant past, the more we\n                    see
  anthropomorphism in more stark-naked versions. The progress of\n                    science
  is a progress from the more imme-\n                    diate, from the more parochial,
  to the more abstract, to the more\n                    general. And this very increase
  of gen\n                    erality and abstraction moves us away from anthro- pomorphism.It
  is exactly this characteristic that explains why even our views of human\n                    nature,
  whether psychological, anthropological, sociological, economical,\n                    or
  any other, are increasingly less anthropomorphic, increasingly more\n                    abstract.
  There are very well-known, clamorous protests about making the\n                    science
  of men so abstract as to dehumanize it; for example, it is said\n                    that
  econo- mists have defiled economics by\n                    the invention of that
  monster, the economic man. There is, perhaps,\n                    some truth in
  such claims, but there is also a Luddite attitude\n                    lurking in
  them, to destroy what seems to threaten us. Once we realize that\n                    anthropomorphism
  often takes the familiar and the comfortably acceptable to\n                    be
  true, we see that anthropomorphism may be objectionable even in the\n                    social
  sciences. Still, it is hard to speak against anthropomorphism in\n                    human
  sciences; we do better to speak against parochialism.For Aristotle's anthropomorphism,
  see his Physics, ed.\n                        and trans. W. D. Ross (Oxford, 1930),
