  Similarly to a living thing, mathematics is a unity within an environment, yet apart from it — a compartment of a larger whole, structurally distinguishable though not functionally completely isolated from or closed to its surroundings.[1]

  Mathematics is structurally distinguishable
- |
  Axiomatic or non-axiomatic
- |
  There are two possible approaches to mathematics, called by R. Feynman "the Babylonian tradition" and "the Greek tradition".[2] They answer differently the question, whether or not some mathematical facts are more fundamental than others, more consequential facts. The same approaches apply to any theory, mathematical or not.
- |
  The Babylonian (non-axiomatic) tradition treats a theory as a network whose nodes are facts and connections are derivations. If some facts are forgotten they probably can be derived from the others.
- |
  The Greek (axiomatic) tradition treats a theory as a tower of more consequential facts called theorems, grounded on the basis of more fundamental facts called axioms. If all theorems are forgotten they surely can be derived from the axioms. The axioms are sparse and simple, not to be forgotten.
- |2+

- |
  Monotonic or non-monotonic
- |
  The distinction between these two approaches is closely related to the distinction between monotonic and non-monotonic logic. These answer differently the question, whether or not a fact can be retracted because of new evidence. Monotonic logic answers in the negative, non-monotonic logic answers in the affirmative.
- |
  Non-monotonic logic is used routinely in everyday life and research. An example: "being a bird, this animal should fly", but the bird may appear to be a penguin. Another example: "the grass is wet, therefore it rained", but the cause may appear to be a sprinkler.
- |
  The non-axiomatic approach is flexible. When needed, some old facts can be retracted, some new facts added, and some derivations changed accordingly. Nowadays this approach is widely used outside mathematics, and only marginally within mathematics (so-called informal mathematics).
- |
  The axiomatic approach is inflexible. A theorem cannot be retracted without removing (or replacing) at least one axiom, which usually has dramatic consequences for many other theorems. Nowadays this approach is widely used in mathematics.
- |
  The non-axiomatic approach is well suited when new evidence often comes from the outside. The axiomatic approach is well suited for a theory that advances only by extracting new consequences from an immutable list of axioms. It may seem that such a development must be dull. Surprisingly, this is an illusion. Being inflexible in some sense, an axiomatic theory can be very flexible in another sense, see Sect. 2.2.

  Sharp or fuzzy; real or ideal
- |
  A fair coin is tossed 1000 times; can it happen at random that heads is obtained all the 1000 times? Emile Borel, a famous mathematician, answers in the negative, with an important reservation:
- |2+

- |
  Such is the sort of event which, though its impossibility may not be rationally demonstrable, is, however, so unlikely that no sensible person will hesitate to declare it actually impossible.[3]
- |
  Why `may not be rationally demonstrable'? Why does this statement remain outside the list of Borel's theorems in probability theory?
- |
  Mathematical truth is sharp, not fuzzy. Every mathematical statement is assumed to be either true or false (even if no one is able to decide) rather than "basically true", "true for all practical purposes" etc. If n heads out of n times is an impossible event for n=1000 then there must exist the least such n (be it known or not). Say, 665 heads can occur, but 666 heads cannot. Then, assuming that 665 heads have just appeared, we see that the next time tails is guaranteed, which contradicts to the assumed memoryless behavior of the coin.
- |
  Another example. The number 4 can be written as a sum of units: 1+1+1+1. Can the number 21000 be written as a sum of units?  Mathematics answers in the affirmative. Indeed, if you can write, say, 2665 as a sum of units, then you can do it twice (connecting the two copies by the plus sign). Complaints about limited resources, appropriate in the real world, are inappropriate in the imaginary, highly idealized mathematical universe.

- |
  Defined or undefined
- |
  Facts are formulated via notions.
- |
  In the non-axiomatic approach, notions are nodes of a network whose connections are definitions. If some notions are forgotten they probably can be restored from the others.
- |
  Searching Google for "define:line" we get "a length without breadth or thickness". Similarly we find definitions for breadth, thickness and so on, recursively. Doing so we would get a large subnetwork; here is its small fragment:
- |2+

- |
  Line: a length without breadth or thickness
- |
  Length: linear extent in space
- |
  Linear: along a line↑
- |
  Extent: a range of locations
- |
  Location: point or extent↑ in space
- |
  Space: unlimited expanse in which everything is located↑
- |
  Breadth: the extent↑ from side to side
- |
  Side: a surface forming part of the outside of an object
- |
  Surface: the extended↑ two-dimensional outer boundary of a three-dimensional object
- |
  Thickness: the dimension through an object as opposed to its length↑ or width
- |
  Width: the extent↑ from side↑ to side↑(Up arrows mean: see above.) We observe that
- |2+

- |2
   circularity appears routinely; for example: line→length→linear→line;
- |2
   the definition of a single notion involves recursively a large number of other, quite remote notions.Such system of notions is unsuitable for a mathematical theory. Here, circularity is disallowed, and the set of involved notions is kept reasonably small (whenever possible). (See also Semantic primes for an attempt to disclose a common mathematics-like structure behind all natural languages.)
- |
  In the axiomatic approach, notions are a tower of defined notions, grounded on the basis of more fundamental notions called undefined primitives. If all defined notions are forgotten they surely can be restored from the undefined primitives. The undefined primitives are sparse and simple, not to be forgotten.
- |
  Curiously, when a non-mathematical encyclopedia contains an article on a mathematical notion, two very different "definitions" may appear, one general (informal), the other mathematical (formal).
- |
  From now on, in this article, "definition" means a mathematical definition (unless explicitly stated otherwise).
- |
  The lack of definition of a primitive notion does not mean lack of any information about this notion. Axioms provide such information, to be used in proofs. Informal (intuitive) understanding of a primitive notion is communicated in a natural language. This information cannot be used in proofs, but is instrumental when guessing what to prove, how to prove, how to apply proved theorems and, last but not least, what to postulate by axioms.
- |2+

- |
  Mathematics is not isolated
- |
  Computers metaphor
- |
  A conceptual metaphor helps to understand one conceptual domain in terms of another. For example, the desktop metaphor treats the monitor of a computer as if it is the user's desktop, which helps to a user not accustomed to the computer. Nowadays many are more accustomed to computers than to mathematics. Thus, analogies with computers may help to understand mathematics. Such analogies are widely used below.
- |2+

- |
  Flexible or inflexible
- |
  In 1960s a computer was an electronic monster able to read from a punch tape simple instructions stipulated by the hardware and execute them quickly, thus performing a lot of boring calculations. Nowadays some parents complain that personal computers are too fascinating. However, without software a personal computer is only able to read (say, from a compact disk) and execute instructions stipulated by the hardware. These instructions are now as technical as before: simple arithmetical and logical operations, loops, conditional execution etc. A computer is dull, be it a monster of 1960s or a nice looking personal computer, unless programmers develop fascinating combinations (called programs) of these technical instructions.
- |
  For a programmer, the instruction set of a given computer is an immutable list. The programmer cannot add new elements to this list, nor modify existing elements. In this sense the instruction set is inflexible. New programs are only new combinations of the given elements. Does it mean that program development is dull? In no way! A good instruction set is universal. It means that a competent programmer feels pretty free to implement any well-understood algorithm provided that the time permits (which is usually most problematic) and the memory and the speed of the computer are high enough (which is usually less problematic). In this sense a good instruction set is very flexible.
- |
  Likewise a mathematician working within a given theory faces its axioms as an immutable list. However, this list can be universal in the sense that a competent mathematician feels pretty free to express any clear mathematical idea. In this sense some axiomatic systems are very flexible.
- |2+

- |
  Universal or specialized
- |
  For a user, the software of a computer is first of all a collection of applications (games, web browsers, media players, word processors, image editors etc.) All applications function within an operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux etc.) The operating system is a universal infrastructure behind various specialized applications. Each application deals with relevant files. The operating system maintains files in general, and catalogs (directories) containing files and possibly other catalogs.
- |
  Likewise, the set theory is a universal infrastructure behind various specialized mathematical theories (algebra, geometry, analysis etc.)  Each specialized mathematical theory deals with relevant objects, relations and sets. The sets theory deals with sets in general, possibly containing other sets, and reduces objects and relations to sets. Alternatively, higher-order logic can be used as such a universal infrastructure, more convenient for computer-assisted formalization of mathematics. Also category theory pretends to the throne of the set theory.[4]In many cases a specialized mathematical theory is a theory of mathematical structures of some kind, often called spaces (of this kind). For example: Euclidean geometry is a theory of Euclidean spaces; topology is a theory of topological spaces; linear algebra is a theory of linear spaces. Differential geometry investigates smooth manifolds. Algebra investigates groups, rings, fields etc.
- |2+

- |
  Motivated or indiscriminate
- |
  Monkeys could type into a computer a sequence of hardware instructions; the computer could execute them; but the result of such "programming" has almost no chance to be fascinating or useful. Fascinating computer games reflect human predilections. Useful programs reflect human needs. A computer is dull for humans unless its software reflects human life in one way or another.
- |
  Likewise, a theorem is of no interest for humans unless it is motivated in one way or another by human life. The motivation may be quite indirect; many theorems "only" help to prove other theorems, many are appreciated "only" for their aesthetic value, etc. But some kind of motivation is necessary. Indiscriminate stream of logical consequences of the axioms is not publishable in the mathematical literature.
- |
  Note that "a theorem" does not mean "a motivated theorem", "an important theorem" etc., not even "an already discovered theorem". All theorems are just an indiscriminate stream of logical consequences of the axioms.
- |
  Theorems of a theory are, by definition, statements that follow from the given axioms according to the given rules (called by different authors inference rules, derivation rules, deduction rules, transformation rules), including the axioms themselves.
- |2+

- |
  From technical to human: definitions
- |
  The gap between a bare hardware and a nice application is too wide for a single jump, or even a triple jump (hardware – operating system – programming language – application). Bridging the gap is a laborious task for many programmers. They compose programs of modules, and modules of subroutines. Each subroutine reduces a bit more useful task to a bit simpler tasks. Ultimately, a useful (or even fascinating) task is reduced to the technical instructions of the bare hardware.
- |
  Likewise, mathematicians bridge the wide gap between useful notions (say, "ellipse" or "normal distribution") and the undefined primitives by a large and complicated system of definitions. Each definition reduces a bit more useful notion to a bit more primitive notions.
- |
  Mathematical definitions are very diverse.
- |
  A definition may be just an abbreviation local to a single calculation, like this: "denoting for convenience  by  we have...".
- |
  A single definition may embed a whole specialized mathematical theory into the universal set-theoretic framework, like this:
- |
  "A Euclidean space consists, by definition, of three sets, whose elements are called points, lines and planes respectively, and six relations, one called betweenness, three called containment and two called congruence, satisfying the following conditions: ..."
- |
  A definition may be given mostly for speaking more concisely, like this: "in a triangle, the altitude of a vertex is, by definition, its distance to the line through the other two vertices".
- |
  A definition may introduce a new revolutionary concept, like this: "the derivative of a function at a point is, by definition, the limit of the ratio..."
- |2+

- |
  Some mathematicians will tell you that the main aim of their research is to find the right definition, after which their whole area will be illuminated. ... For other mathematicians, the main purpose of definitions is to prove theorems... [5]
- |
  Principles and practices
- |
  Rigor or intuition
- |
  Mathematics as a cultural process is not bound by monotonic logic. For example, it was treated till 1872 as intuitively evident fact that any curve on the plane has a tangent line everywhere except maybe a discrete set of points. However, this "fact" was refuted and retracted.
- |2+

- |
  A century later, we have seen so many monsters of this sort that we have become a little blasé. But the effect produced on the majority of nineteenth century mathematicians ranged from disgust to consternation.[6]
- |
  Since then, intuition is not a valid argument in mathematical proofs. A mathematical theory is bound by monotonic logic. If needed, mathematics as a cultural process can retract an axiomatic theory as whole (rather than some theorems) and accept another axiomatic theory. (Moreover, in a remote perspective the axiomatic approach could be abandoned.)
- |2+

- |
  Formal or formalizable
- |
  An example. If  then , since . This simple algebraic argument can be checked by a human or even a computer. No need to understand the meaning of the statement; it is sufficient to know the relevant formal rules. The statement follows from the given rules only, rigorously, without explicit or implicit use of intuition. A formal proof guarantees that a theorem will never be retracted.
- |
  A universal formal language conceived by Gottfried Leibniz near 1685,
- |2+

- |
  capable of expressing all humans thoughts unambiguously, of strengthening our power of deduction, of avoiding errors by a purely mechanical effort of attention[7]
- |
  was partially implemented in mathematics two centuries later, especially, as a formal language of set theory. In the form introduced by Bourbaki this language contains four logical signs, three specific signs, and letters. Its rules are considerably more complicated than elementary algebra.
- |
  However, this formal language is never used by a typical mathematician. Likewise, most programmers never use the instructions of the computer hardware. Instead, they develop applications in appropriate programming languages (BASIC, Java, C++, Python etc). A statement of a programming language corresponds usually to many hardware instructions; the correspondence is established by special programs (compilers and interpreters). A programming language is geared to programmers, hardware instructions --- to hardware.
- |
  The gap between the language of mathematical texts (books and articles) and the formal language of the set theory is even wider than the gap between a programming language and hardware instructions. It is as wide as the gap between pseudocode and Turing machines.
- |
  A programmer, when coding a program, knows that the computer does exactly what it is told to do. In contrast, an author or speaker, when communicating with other people, can be ambiguous, make small errors, and still expect to be understood. Pseudocode is a description of an algorithm, intended for human reading, that can be converted into a code by any competent programmer. A code is formal; a pseudocode is formalizable.
- |
  Likewise, communication between mathematicians is made in a formalizable language.
- |2+

- |
  In practice, the mathematician ... is content to bring the exposition to a point where his experience and mathematical flair tell him that translation into formal language would be no more than an exercise of patience (though doubtless a very tedious one).[8]
- |
  A mathematician, using a formalizable language, need not know all technical details of the underlying formal language. Many equivalent formal languages may be used interchangeably. Likewise, a single pseudocode can be used when coding in different programming languages, as long as these are not too far from each other.
- |2+

- |
  Axiomatic or axiomatizable
- |2
    Two finite lists of vectors generate (by summation) the same infinite set of vectors. Similarly, different finite lists of axioms can be used for generating the same infinite set of theorems.
- |
  A mathematician, working within an axiomatic theory, need not remember the list of axioms in full detail. It is sufficient to remember a list of theorems that contains all axioms or, more generally, such that each axiom follows easily from these theorems. (Here, as usual, "theorems" are treated inclusively, as "axioms and theorems".)
- |
  Two lists of axioms are called equivalent if every axiom of each list follows from the axioms of the other list. Such lists of axioms may be used interchangeably, since they generate the same theorems.
- |2+

- |
  Some details
- |
  Consistent or inconsistent
- |
  If a theory states that 2+2=5, it is a paradox but not yet a contradiction. By "paradox" people may mean
- |2+

- |
  a contradiction;
- |
  an apparent contradiction;
- |
  something counterintuitive;
- |
  something surprising;
- |
  something ironic;etc. In contrast, a contradiction (in a mathematical theory) is, by definition, a pair of theorems (of the given theory) such that one is the negation of the other. Thus, two theorems
- |2+

- " \n"
- |2
   are still not a contradiction. Two theorems
- |2+

- " \n"
- |2
   are a contradiction.
- |
  If a contradiction exists in a given theory, this theory is called inconsistent. Otherwise, if no contradictions exist (rather than merely not found for now), the theory is called consistent.
- |
  For a mathematician, an inconsistent theory is completely useless. Some philosophers disagree:

- |
  Superstitious dread and veneration by mathematicians in face of a contradiction[9]
- |
  But a mathematician insists: an inconsistent theory is completely useless, since all statements (in the given language) are theorems! The reason is, proof by contradiction.
- |
  No matter which statement X is in question, we always can prove X as follows:
- |2+

- |2
   Assume that X is false;
- |2
   ... (put the proof of the contradiction here);
- |2
   the assumption leads to a contradiction, thus X is true.It is tempting to object that the contradiction has nothing in common with the assumption and therefore cannot invalidate it. However, the rules of formal logic do not demand that the contradiction has something in common with the assumption. Some attempts to change these rules were made (so-called "relevance logic", or "relevant logic"), but with little success. It is always possible to obfuscate the proof of the contradiction, making it seemingly entangled with X. We have no formal criterion able to unmask any possible fictitious participation of X in the proof of the contradiction.

  David Hilbert aimed to find axioms sufficient for all mathematics and to prove their consistency from the assumption that the "finitary arithmetic" (a subsystem of the usual arithmetic of the positive integers, chosen to be philosophically uncontroversial) was consistent. A fatal blow was dealt by the second Gödel's incompleteness theorem. Consistency of a theory cannot be proved by a weaker theory, nor by the same theory. It can be proved by a stronger theory, which does not dispel doubts: if the given theory is inconsistent then the stronger theory, being all the more inconsistent, can prove every claim, be it true or false.
- |
  Many mathematicians feel that specialized theories, being more reliable than universal theories, are like watertight compartments. If a contradiction will be found in the used universal theory, specialized theories will separate and wait for a better universal theory.
- |2+

- |
  I have always felt that, if one day someone came up with a contradiction in mathematics, I would just say, "Well, those crazy logicians are at it again," and go about my business as I was going the day before.[10]

  Univalent or multivalent
- |
  Plane geometry (called also "planar geometry") is a part of solid geometry that restricts itself to a single plane ("the plane") treated as a geometric universe. The question "which plane?" is inappropriate, since planes do not differ in their geometric properties. Every two planes α, β are isomorphic, that is, there exists an isomorphism f between α and β. Treating α and β as sets of points one defines isomorphism as an invertible (one-to-one and onto) map f : α → β preserving all primitive relations. Namely: f maps lines into lines; the distance between f(A) and f(B) on β is equal to the distance between A and B on α; etc. The same is required of the inverse map .
- |
  Axioms of the plane Euclidean geometry leave no freedom, they determine uniquely all geometric properties of the plane. More exactly: all Euclidean planes are mutually isomorphic. In this sense we have "the" Euclidean plane. In terms of Bourbaki, the plane
- |
  Euclidean geometry is an univalent theory. In contrast, axioms of a linear space (called also vector space) leave a freedom: a linear space may be one-dimensional, two-dimensional, three-dimensional, four-dimensional and so on (infinite dimension is also possible). Linear algebra is multivalent.
- |
  Axioms of topology leave much more freedom; every subset of (say) the plane is an example of a topological space, be it connected or not, compact or not, be it a curve, a domain, a fractal, or whatever; and all these are still a minority among all topological spaces. Topology is multivalent.
- |
  According to Bourbaki, the study of multivalent theories is the most striking feature which distinguishes modern mathematics from classical mathematics.[11]A similar idea occurs in mathematical logic: a theory is called categorical if all its models are mutually isomorphic. However, for Bourbaki a theory is embedded into the set theory, while in logic a theory is standalone (embedded into the first-order logic).
- |2+

- |
  Complete or incomplete
- |
  A theory is called complete, if every statement in its language can be proved or disproved. In other words: if such a statement is not a theorem then its negation is necessarily a theorem.
- |
  A statement (in the language of the given theory) is called independent (in other words, undecidable) in this theory, if it is not a theorem, but also its negation is not a theorem.
- |
  Independent statements appear naturally in multivalent theories. For example, in linear algebra the statement "three vectors cannot be linearly independent" is neither provable nor disprovable, since the dimension of a linear space may be 2 or 3 (or anything else).
- |
  Thus, multivalent theories are usually incomplete.
- |
  What about univalent theories? Seemingly, these should be complete. For example, the plane Euclidean geometry should prove all geometric statements that hold on the Euclidean plane, and only such statements. Similarly, arithmetics of natural numbers should prove all true arithmetical statements about natural numbers, and only these. Unexpectedly, the situation is far more complicated than these naive ideas, see Sect. 4.7.
- |2+

- |
  Definitions: abbreviations or extensions
- |
  According to Sect. 2.4, a theorem is a logical consequence of the axioms. However, what about definitions? They are numerous and important, according to Sect. 2.5. Two possible approaches to definitions answer differently the question, whether they belong to the formal theory or not.
- |
  One approach treats definitions as abbreviations, used in the formalizable language and eliminated when translating into the formal language. Thus, the formal theory contains only primitive notions and axioms, not definitions.
- |
  According to the other approach, each definition extends the formal theory. The new (extended) theory contains one more notion and one more axiom. Informally, the new notion is just defined, and the new axiom is just the definition. But formally, the new theory still contains only primitive notions and axioms, not definitions.
- |
  An example.
- |
  Definition: a prime number is a natural number having exactly two divisors. (These are 1 and the number itself, of course.)
- |
  Theorem: there are infinitely many prime numbers.
- |
  The first approach (abbreviations). In the formal language, the notion "prime" is eliminated, as follows. Theorem: there are infinitely many natural numbers having exactly two divisors. The proof also does not involve the notion "prime".
- |
  The second approach (extensions). The new formal theory stipulates a new primitive notion "prime" and a new axiom: a natural number is prime if and only if it has exactly two divisors. This axiom is used in the proof of the theorem.
- |2+

- |
  Formalizable in reality or in principle
- |
  The integer 1 is a very simple example of a mathematical object that can be defined in the language of set theory. Its definition, treated as an abbreviation (rather than extension), can be translated from this formalizable language into any corresponding formal language, in particular, into the formal language introduced by Bourbaki. However, the length of the resulting formal definition is equal to 4,523,659,424,929.[12] It would take about 4000 gigabytes of computer memory! More complicated mathematical definitions are much longer. Clearly, such formalization is possible only in principle, similarly to the possibility of writing 21000 as a sum of units.
- |
  This formal language is so verbose because of substitution. Here is an algebraic example: substituting  into  gives an expression of length 64, containing 8 occurrences of a. Further, substitute  and you get an expression of length 152, containing 24 occurrences of u. And so on.
- |
  There exist formal mathematical languages intended for practical use, for example, Mizar. These treat definitions as extensions.
- |2+

- |
  Generating all theorems; decidable or undecidable
- |
  It is impossible to list all theorems, since they are infinitely many. However, an endless algorithmic process can generate theorems, only theorems, and all theorems in the sense that every theorem will be generated, sooner or later. In more technical words: the set of all theorems is recursively enumerable. Some theories have infinitely many axioms generated by a finite list of so-called axiom schemata. Still, the set of all theorems is recursively enumerable, since the set of axioms is.
- |
  An open question (in a mathematical theory) is a statement neither proved nor disproved. It is possible (in principle, not necessarily in practice) to run the theorem-generating algorithm waiting for one of two events: either the given statement appears to be a theorem, or its negation does; in both cases the (formerly) open question is decided. If the theory is complete, this must happen sooner or later.
- |
  A theory is called decidable if there exists an algorithm that, given an arbitrary statement (in the language of the theory) decides whether it is a theorem or not. (In more technical words: if the set of all theorems is recursive.)
- |
  The argument above shows that a complete theory is decidable.
- |2+

- |
  A theory as a crystal ball?
- |
  Imagine a theory able to describe the whole discrete mathematics (the set theory?) or, at least, arbitrary algorithmic computations, in other words, formal machines (like computers, but with unlimited resources). Assume that the theorems include all true statements about these machines, and no wrong statements about them. Then a formal machine can use this theory as a "crystal ball", — for predicting the future of any formal machine. In particular, for deciding, whether a given machine will eventually halt, or will run forever (so-called halting problem). To this end it runs the theorem-generating algorithm until either the statement "such machine eventually halts" or its negation appears among the theorems.
- |
  In order to predict the future of a formal machine Y, a formal machine X needs the code of Y. It does not mean that the code of Y must be inscribed into (and therefore be shorter than) the code of X. Instead, X can generate the code of Y. This way, a single machine X can predict the future of infinitely many machines Y, and moreover, of all possible machines Y, generating their codes in an endless loop.
- |
  Can X predict its own future? It may seem that the affirmative answer is ensured by the argument above. However, how can X know, which Y is identical to X? In other words, how can X know (it means, be able to generate) its own code?
- |
  It is a well-known and nontrivial fact that some programs, so-called quine programs, can generate their own texts. (See also halting problem.) It may seem to be a trick, but in fact it is a form of self-replication, and it uses a 4×109 years old patent of life: a cell replicates itself using its DNA, and also replicates the DNA itself.
- |
  Using the quine technique, a machine X can predict its own future. Is it paradoxical? Seemingly not, since X is a deterministic machine, it has no free will. But nevertheless it is paradoxical, since we may program X as follows:
- |2+

- |
  predict your own future: whether you will eventually halt, or will run forever;
- |
  if "halt" is predicted, enter an infinite loop;
- |
  otherwise (if "run forever" is predicted), halt.We get a paradox, which means that the assumptions made in the beginning of this section cannot be satisfied. An axiomatic theory cannot be such that its theorems include all true statements about formal machines, and no wrong statements about them! This important conclusion is closely related to the famous Gödel theorem.[13]

  }Similarly to a living thing, mathematics is a unity within an environment, yet apart from it — a compartment of a larger whole, structurally distinguishable though not functionally completely isolated from or closed to its surroundings.[1]There are two possible approaches to mathematics, called by R. Feynman "the Babylonian tradition" and "the Greek tradition".[2] They answer differently the question, whether or not some mathematical facts are more fundamental than others, more consequential facts. The same approaches apply to any theory, mathematical or not.
- |
  The Babylonian (non-axiomatic) tradition treats a theory as a network whose nodes are facts and connections are derivations. If some facts are forgotten they probably can be derived from the others.
- |
  The Greek (axiomatic) tradition treats a theory as a tower of more consequential facts called theorems, grounded on the basis of more fundamental facts called axioms. If all theorems are forgotten they surely can be derived from the axioms. The axioms are sparse and simple, not to be forgotten.
- |
  The distinction between these two approaches is closely related to the distinction between monotonic and non-monotonic logic. These answer differently the question, whether or not a fact can be retracted because of new evidence. Monotonic logic answers in the negative, non-monotonic logic answers in the affirmative.
- |
  Non-monotonic logic is used routinely in everyday life and research. An example: "being a bird, this animal should fly", but the bird may appear to be a penguin. Another example: "the grass is wet, therefore it rained", but the cause may appear to be a sprinkler.
- |
  The non-axiomatic approach is flexible. When needed, some old facts can be retracted, some new facts added, and some derivations changed accordingly. Nowadays this approach is widely used outside mathematics, and only marginally within mathematics (so-called informal mathematics).
- |
  The axiomatic approach is inflexible. A theorem cannot be retracted without removing (or replacing) at least one axiom, which usually has dramatic consequences for many other theorems. Nowadays this approach is widely used in mathematics.
- |
  The non-axiomatic approach is well suited when new evidence often comes from the outside. The axiomatic approach is well suited for a theory that advances only by extracting new consequences from an immutable list of axioms. It may seem that such a development must be dull. Surprisingly, this is an illusion. Being inflexible in some sense, an axiomatic theory can be very flexible in another sense, see Sect. 2.2.
- |
  A fair coin is tossed 1000 times; can it happen at random that heads is obtained all the 1000 times? Emile Borel, a famous mathematician, answers in the negative, with an important reservation:
- |
  Why `may not be rationally demonstrable'? Why does this statement remain outside the list of Borel's theorems in probability theory?
- |
  Mathematical truth is sharp, not fuzzy. Every mathematical statement is assumed to be either true or false (even if no one is able to decide) rather than "basically true", "true for all practical purposes" etc. If n heads out of n times is an impossible event for n=1000 then there must exist the least such n (be it known or not). Say, 665 heads can occur, but 666 heads cannot. Then, assuming that 665 heads have just appeared, we see that the next time tails is guaranteed, which contradicts to the assumed memoryless behavior of the coin.
- |
  Another example. The number 4 can be written as a sum of units: 1+1+1+1. Can the number 21000 be written as a sum of units?  Mathematics answers in the affirmative. Indeed, if you can write, say, 2665 as a sum of units, then you can do it twice (connecting the two copies by the plus sign). Complaints about limited resources, appropriate in the real world, are inappropriate in the imaginary, highly idealized mathematical universe.
- |
  Facts are formulated via notions.
- |
  In the non-axiomatic approach, notions are nodes of a network whose connections are definitions. If some notions are forgotten they probably can be restored from the others.
- |
  Searching Google for "define:line" we get "a length without breadth or thickness". Similarly we find definitions for breadth, thickness and so on, recursively. Doing so we would get a large subnetwork; here is its small fragment:
- |
  (Up arrows mean: see above.) We observe that
- |
  Such system of notions is unsuitable for a mathematical theory. Here, circularity is disallowed, and the set of involved notions is kept reasonably small (whenever possible). (See also Semantic primes for an attempt to disclose a common mathematics-like structure behind all natural languages.)
- |
  In the axiomatic approach, notions are a tower of defined notions, grounded on the basis of more fundamental notions called undefined primitives. If all defined notions are forgotten they surely can be restored from the undefined primitives. The undefined primitives are sparse and simple, not to be forgotten.
- |
  Curiously, when a non-mathematical encyclopedia contains an article on a mathematical notion, two very different "definitions" may appear, one general (informal), the other mathematical (formal).
- |
  From now on, in this article, "definition" means a mathematical definition (unless explicitly stated otherwise).
- |
  The lack of definition of a primitive notion does not mean lack of any information about this notion. Axioms provide such information, to be used in proofs. Informal (intuitive) understanding of a primitive notion is communicated in a natural language. This information cannot be used in proofs, but is instrumental when guessing what to prove, how to prove, how to apply proved theorems and, last but not least, what to postulate by axioms.
- |
  A conceptual metaphor helps to understand one conceptual domain in terms of another. For example, the desktop metaphor treats the monitor of a computer as if it is the user's desktop, which helps to a user not accustomed to the computer. Nowadays many are more accustomed to computers than to mathematics. Thus, analogies with computers may help to understand mathematics. Such analogies are widely used below.
- |
  In 1960s a computer was an electronic monster able to read from a punch tape simple instructions stipulated by the hardware and execute them quickly, thus performing a lot of boring calculations. Nowadays some parents complain that personal computers are too fascinating. However, without software a personal computer is only able to read (say, from a compact disk) and execute instructions stipulated by the hardware. These instructions are now as technical as before: simple arithmetical and logical operations, loops, conditional execution etc. A computer is dull, be it a monster of 1960s or a nice looking personal computer, unless programmers develop fascinating combinations (called programs) of these technical instructions.
- |
  For a programmer, the instruction set of a given computer is an immutable list. The programmer cannot add new elements to this list, nor modify existing elements. In this sense the instruction set is inflexible. New programs are only new combinations of the given elements. Does it mean that program development is dull? In no way! A good instruction set is universal. It means that a competent programmer feels pretty free to implement any well-understood algorithm provided that the time permits (which is usually most problematic) and the memory and the speed of the computer are high enough (which is usually less problematic). In this sense a good instruction set is very flexible.
- |
  Likewise a mathematician working within a given theory faces its axioms as an immutable list. However, this list can be universal in the sense that a competent mathematician feels pretty free to express any clear mathematical idea. In this sense some axiomatic systems are very flexible.
- |
  For a user, the software of a computer is first of all a collection of applications (games, web browsers, media players, word processors, image editors etc.) All applications function within an operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux etc.) The operating system is a universal infrastructure behind various specialized applications. Each application deals with relevant files. The operating system maintains files in general, and catalogs (directories) containing files and possibly other catalogs.
- |
  Likewise, the set theory is a universal infrastructure behind various specialized mathematical theories (algebra, geometry, analysis etc.)  Each specialized mathematical theory deals with relevant objects, relations and sets. The sets theory deals with sets in general, possibly containing other sets, and reduces objects and relations to sets. Alternatively, higher-order logic can be used as such a universal infrastructure, more convenient for computer-assisted formalization of mathematics. Also category theory pretends to the throne of the set theory.[4]In many cases a specialized mathematical theory is a theory of mathematical structures of some kind, often called spaces (of this kind). For example: Euclidean geometry is a theory of Euclidean spaces; topology is a theory of topological spaces; linear algebra is a theory of linear spaces. Differential geometry investigates smooth manifolds. Algebra investigates groups, rings, fields etc.
- |
  Monkeys could type into a computer a sequence of hardware instructions; the computer could execute them; but the result of such "programming" has almost no chance to be fascinating or useful. Fascinating computer games reflect human predilections. Useful programs reflect human needs. A computer is dull for humans unless its software reflects human life in one way or another.
- |
  Likewise, a theorem is of no interest for humans unless it is motivated in one way or another by human life. The motivation may be quite indirect; many theorems "only" help to prove other theorems, many are appreciated "only" for their aesthetic value, etc. But some kind of motivation is necessary. Indiscriminate stream of logical consequences of the axioms is not publishable in the mathematical literature.
- |
  Note that "a theorem" does not mean "a motivated theorem", "an important theorem" etc., not even "an already discovered theorem". All theorems are just an indiscriminate stream of logical consequences of the axioms.
- |
  Theorems of a theory are, by definition, statements that follow from the given axioms according to the given rules (called by different authors inference rules, derivation rules, deduction rules, transformation rules), including the axioms themselves.
- |
  The gap between a bare hardware and a nice application is too wide for a single jump, or even a triple jump (hardware – operating system – programming language – application). Bridging the gap is a laborious task for many programmers. They compose programs of modules, and modules of subroutines. Each subroutine reduces a bit more useful task to a bit simpler tasks. Ultimately, a useful (or even fascinating) task is reduced to the technical instructions of the bare hardware.
- |
  Likewise, mathematicians bridge the wide gap between useful notions (say, "ellipse" or "normal distribution") and the undefined primitives by a large and complicated system of definitions. Each definition reduces a bit more useful notion to a bit more primitive notions.
- |
  Mathematical definitions are very diverse.
- |
  A definition may be just an abbreviation local to a single calculation, like this: "denoting for convenience  by  we have...".
- |
  A single definition may embed a whole specialized mathematical theory into the universal set-theoretic framework, like this:
- |
  "A Euclidean space consists, by definition, of three sets, whose elements are called points, lines and planes respectively, and six relations, one called betweenness, three called containment and two called congruence, satisfying the following conditions: ..."
- |
  A definition may be given mostly for speaking more concisely, like this: "in a triangle, the altitude of a vertex is, by definition, its distance to the line through the other two vertices".
- |
  A definition may introduce a new revolutionary concept, like this: "the derivative of a function at a point is, by definition, the limit of the ratio..."
- |
  Mathematics as a cultural process is not bound by monotonic logic. For example, it was treated till 1872 as intuitively evident fact that any curve on the plane has a tangent line everywhere except maybe a discrete set of points. However, this "fact" was refuted and retracted.
- |
  Since then, intuition is not a valid argument in mathematical proofs. A mathematical theory is bound by monotonic logic. If needed, mathematics as a cultural process can retract an axiomatic theory as whole (rather than some theorems) and accept another axiomatic theory. (Moreover, in a remote perspective the axiomatic approach could be abandoned.)
- |
  An example. If  then , since . This simple algebraic argument can be checked by a human or even a computer. No need to understand the meaning of the statement; it is sufficient to know the relevant formal rules. The statement follows from the given rules only, rigorously, without explicit or implicit use of intuition. A formal proof guarantees that a theorem will never be retracted.
- |
  A universal formal language conceived by Gottfried Leibniz near 1685,
- |
  was partially implemented in mathematics two centuries later, especially, as a formal language of set theory. In the form introduced by Bourbaki this language contains four logical signs, three specific signs, and letters. Its rules are considerably more complicated than elementary algebra.
- |
  However, this formal language is never used by a typical mathematician. Likewise, most programmers never use the instructions of the computer hardware. Instead, they develop applications in appropriate programming languages (BASIC, Java, C++, Python etc). A statement of a programming language corresponds usually to many hardware instructions; the correspondence is established by special programs (compilers and interpreters). A programming language is geared to programmers, hardware instructions --- to hardware.
- |
  The gap between the language of mathematical texts (books and articles) and the formal language of the set theory is even wider than the gap between a programming language and hardware instructions. It is as wide as the gap between pseudocode and Turing machines.
- |
  A programmer, when coding a program, knows that the computer does exactly what it is told to do. In contrast, an author or speaker, when communicating with other people, can be ambiguous, make small errors, and still expect to be understood. Pseudocode is a description of an algorithm, intended for human reading, that can be converted into a code by any competent programmer. A code is formal; a pseudocode is formalizable.
- |
  Likewise, communication between mathematicians is made in a formalizable language.
- |
  A mathematician, using a formalizable language, need not know all technical details of the underlying formal language. Many equivalent formal languages may be used interchangeably. Likewise, a single pseudocode can be used when coding in different programming languages, as long as these are not too far from each other.
- |
  A mathematician, working within an axiomatic theory, need not remember the list of axioms in full detail. It is sufficient to remember a list of theorems that contains all axioms or, more generally, such that each axiom follows easily from these theorems. (Here, as usual, "theorems" are treated inclusively, as "axioms and theorems".)
- |
  Two lists of axioms are called equivalent if every axiom of each list follows from the axioms of the other list. Such lists of axioms may be used interchangeably, since they generate the same theorems.
- |
  If a theory states that 2+2=5, it is a paradox but not yet a contradiction. By "paradox" people may mean
- |
  etc. In contrast, a contradiction (in a mathematical theory) is, by definition, a pair of theorems (of the given theory) such that one is the negation of the other. Thus, two theorems
- |
  are still not a contradiction. Two theorems
- |
  are a contradiction.
- |
  If a contradiction exists in a given theory, this theory is called inconsistent. Otherwise, if no contradictions exist (rather than merely not found for now), the theory is called consistent.
- |
  For a mathematician, an inconsistent theory is completely useless. Some philosophers disagree:
- |
  But a mathematician insists: an inconsistent theory is completely useless, since all statements (in the given language) are theorems! The reason is, proof by contradiction.
- |
  No matter which statement X is in question, we always can prove X as follows:
- |
  It is tempting to object that the contradiction has nothing in common with the assumption and therefore cannot invalidate it. However, the rules of formal logic do not demand that the contradiction has something in common with the assumption. Some attempts to change these rules were made (so-called "relevance logic", or "relevant logic"), but with little success. It is always possible to obfuscate the proof of the contradiction, making it seemingly entangled with X. We have no formal criterion able to unmask any possible fictitious participation of X in the proof of the contradiction.
- |
  David Hilbert aimed to find axioms sufficient for all mathematics and to prove their consistency from the assumption that the "finitary arithmetic" (a subsystem of the usual arithmetic of the positive integers, chosen to be philosophically uncontroversial) was consistent. A fatal blow was dealt by the second Gödel's incompleteness theorem. Consistency of a theory cannot be proved by a weaker theory, nor by the same theory. It can be proved by a stronger theory, which does not dispel doubts: if the given theory is inconsistent then the stronger theory, being all the more inconsistent, can prove every claim, be it true or false.
- |
  Many mathematicians feel that specialized theories, being more reliable than universal theories, are like watertight compartments. If a contradiction will be found in the used universal theory, specialized theories will separate and wait for a better universal theory.
- |
  Plane geometry (called also "planar geometry") is a part of solid geometry that restricts itself to a single plane ("the plane") treated as a geometric universe. The question "which plane?" is inappropriate, since planes do not differ in their geometric properties. Every two planes α, β are isomorphic, that is, there exists an isomorphism f between α and β. Treating α and β as sets of points one defines isomorphism as an invertible (one-to-one and onto) map f : α → β preserving all primitive relations. Namely: f maps lines into lines; the distance between f(A) and f(B) on β is equal to the distance between A and B on α; etc. The same is required of the inverse map .
- |
  Axioms of the plane Euclidean geometry leave no freedom, they determine uniquely all geometric properties of the plane. More exactly: all Euclidean planes are mutually isomorphic. In this sense we have "the" Euclidean plane. In terms of Bourbaki, the plane
- |
  Euclidean geometry is an univalent theory. In contrast, axioms of a linear space (called also vector space) leave a freedom: a linear space may be one-dimensional, two-dimensional, three-dimensional, four-dimensional and so on (infinite dimension is also possible). Linear algebra is multivalent.
- |
  Axioms of topology leave much more freedom; every subset of (say) the plane is an example of a topological space, be it connected or not, compact or not, be it a curve, a domain, a fractal, or whatever; and all these are still a minority among all topological spaces. Topology is multivalent.
- |
  According to Bourbaki, the study of multivalent theories is the most striking feature which distinguishes modern mathematics from classical mathematics.[11]A similar idea occurs in mathematical logic: a theory is called categorical if all its models are mutually isomorphic. However, for Bourbaki a theory is embedded into the set theory, while in logic a theory is standalone (embedded into the first-order logic).
- |
  A theory is called complete, if every statement in its language can be proved or disproved. In other words: if such a statement is not a theorem then its negation is necessarily a theorem.
- |
  A statement (in the language of the given theory) is called independent (in other words, undecidable) in this theory, if it is not a theorem, but also its negation is not a theorem.
- |
  Independent statements appear naturally in multivalent theories. For example, in linear algebra the statement "three vectors cannot be linearly independent" is neither provable nor disprovable, since the dimension of a linear space may be 2 or 3 (or anything else).
- |
  Thus, multivalent theories are usually incomplete.
- |
  What about univalent theories? Seemingly, these should be complete. For example, the plane Euclidean geometry should prove all geometric statements that hold on the Euclidean plane, and only such statements. Similarly, arithmetics of natural numbers should prove all true arithmetical statements about natural numbers, and only these. Unexpectedly, the situation is far more complicated than these naive ideas, see Sect. 4.7.
- |
  According to Sect. 2.4, a theorem is a logical consequence of the axioms. However, what about definitions? They are numerous and important, according to Sect. 2.5. Two possible approaches to definitions answer differently the question, whether they belong to the formal theory or not.
- |
  One approach treats definitions as abbreviations, used in the formalizable language and eliminated when translating into the formal language. Thus, the formal theory contains only primitive notions and axioms, not definitions.
- |
  According to the other approach, each definition extends the formal theory. The new (extended) theory contains one more notion and one more axiom. Informally, the new notion is just defined, and the new axiom is just the definition. But formally, the new theory still contains only primitive notions and axioms, not definitions.
- |
  An example.
- |
  Definition: a prime number is a natural number having exactly two divisors. (These are 1 and the number itself, of course.)
- |
  Theorem: there are infinitely many prime numbers.
- |
  The first approach (abbreviations). In the formal language, the notion "prime" is eliminated, as follows. Theorem: there are infinitely many natural numbers having exactly two divisors. The proof also does not involve the notion "prime".
- |
  The second approach (extensions). The new formal theory stipulates a new primitive notion "prime" and a new axiom: a natural number is prime if and only if it has exactly two divisors. This axiom is used in the proof of the theorem.
- |
  The integer 1 is a very simple example of a mathematical object that can be defined in the language of set theory. Its definition, treated as an abbreviation (rather than extension), can be translated from this formalizable language into any corresponding formal language, in particular, into the formal language introduced by Bourbaki. However, the length of the resulting formal definition is equal to 4,523,659,424,929.[12] It would take about 4000 gigabytes of computer memory! More complicated mathematical definitions are much longer. Clearly, such formalization is possible only in principle, similarly to the possibility of writing 21000 as a sum of units.
- |
  This formal language is so verbose because of substitution. Here is an algebraic example: substituting  into  gives an expression of length 64, containing 8 occurrences of a. Further, substitute  and you get an expression of length 152, containing 24 occurrences of u. And so on.
- |
  There exist formal mathematical languages intended for practical use, for example, Mizar. These treat definitions as extensions.
- |
  It is impossible to list all theorems, since they are infinitely many. However, an endless algorithmic process can generate theorems, only theorems, and all theorems in the sense that every theorem will be generated, sooner or later. In more technical words: the set of all theorems is recursively enumerable. Some theories have infinitely many axioms generated by a finite list of so-called axiom schemata. Still, the set of all theorems is recursively enumerable, since the set of axioms is.
- |
  An open question (in a mathematical theory) is a statement neither proved nor disproved. It is possible (in principle, not necessarily in practice) to run the theorem-generating algorithm waiting for one of two events: either the given statement appears to be a theorem, or its negation does; in both cases the (formerly) open question is decided. If the theory is complete, this must happen sooner or later.
- |
  A theory is called decidable if there exists an algorithm that, given an arbitrary statement (in the language of the theory) decides whether it is a theorem or not. (In more technical words: if the set of all theorems is recursive.)
- |
  The argument above shows that a complete theory is decidable.
- |
  Imagine a theory able to describe the whole discrete mathematics (the set theory?) or, at least, arbitrary algorithmic computations, in other words, formal machines (like computers, but with unlimited resources). Assume that the theorems include all true statements about these machines, and no wrong statements about them. Then a formal machine can use this theory as a "crystal ball", — for predicting the future of any formal machine. In particular, for deciding, whether a given machine will eventually halt, or will run forever (so-called halting problem). To this end it runs the theorem-generating algorithm until either the statement "such machine eventually halts" or its negation appears among the theorems.
- |
  In order to predict the future of a formal machine Y, a formal machine X needs the code of Y. It does not mean that the code of Y must be inscribed into (and therefore be shorter than) the code of X. Instead, X can generate the code of Y. This way, a single machine X can predict the future of infinitely many machines Y, and moreover, of all possible machines Y, generating their codes in an endless loop.
- |
  Can X predict its own future? It may seem that the affirmative answer is ensured by the argument above. However, how can X know, which Y is identical to X? In other words, how can X know (it means, be able to generate) its own code?
- |
  It is a well-known and nontrivial fact that some programs, so-called quine programs, can generate their own texts. (See also halting problem.) It may seem to be a trick, but in fact it is a form of self-replication, and it uses a 4×109 years old patent of life: a cell replicates itself using its DNA, and also replicates the DNA itself.
- |
  Using the quine technique, a machine X can predict its own future. Is it paradoxical? Seemingly not, since X is a deterministic machine, it has no free will. But nevertheless it is paradoxical, since we may program X as follows:
- |
  We get a paradox, which means that the assumptions made in the beginning of this section cannot be satisfied. An axiomatic theory cannot be such that its theorems include all true statements about formal machines, and no wrong statements about them! This important conclusion is closely related to the famous Gödel theorem.[13]Borel, Émile (1962), Probabilities and life, Dover publ. (translation).

  to a living thing, mathematics is a unity within an environment, yet apart from
  it — a compartment of a larger whole, structurally distinguishable though not functionally
  completely isolated from or closed to its surroundings.[1]\n  (CC) Photo: Anders

  is structurally distinguishable\nAxiomatic or non-axiomatic\nThere are two possible
  approaches to mathematics, called by R. Feynman \"the Babylonian tradition\" and
  \"the Greek tradition\".[2] They answer differently the question, whether or not
  some mathematical facts are more fundamental than others, more consequential facts.
  The same approaches apply to any theory, mathematical or not.\nThe Babylonian (non-axiomatic)
  tradition treats a theory as a network whose nodes are facts and connections are
  derivations. If some facts are forgotten they probably can be derived from the others.\nThe
  Greek (axiomatic) tradition treats a theory as a tower of more consequential facts
  called theorems, grounded on the basis of more fundamental facts called axioms.
  If all theorems are forgotten they surely can be derived from the axioms. The axioms
  are sparse and simple, not to be forgotten.\n\nMonotonic or non-monotonic\nThe distinction
  between these two approaches is closely related to the distinction between monotonic
  and non-monotonic logic. These answer differently the question, whether or not a
  fact can be retracted because of new evidence. Monotonic logic answers in the negative,
  non-monotonic logic answers in the affirmative.\nNon-monotonic logic is used routinely
  in everyday life and research. An example: \"being a bird, this animal should fly\",
  but the bird may appear to be a penguin. Another example: \"the grass is wet, therefore
  it rained\", but the cause may appear to be a sprinkler.\nThe non-axiomatic approach
  is flexible. When needed, some old facts can be retracted, some new facts added,
  and some derivations changed accordingly. Nowadays this approach is widely used
  outside mathematics, and only marginally within mathematics (so-called informal
  mathematics).\nThe axiomatic approach is inflexible. A theorem cannot be retracted
  without removing (or replacing) at least one axiom, which usually has dramatic consequences
  for many other theorems. Nowadays this approach is widely used in mathematics.\nThe
  non-axiomatic approach is well suited when new evidence often comes from the outside.
  The axiomatic approach is well suited for a theory that advances only by extracting
  new consequences from an immutable list of axioms. It may seem that such a development
  must be dull. Surprisingly, this is an illusion. Being inflexible in some sense,
  an axiomatic theory can be very flexible in another sense, see Sect. 2.2.\n\nSharp
  or fuzzy; real or ideal\nA fair coin is tossed 1000 times; can it happen at random
  that heads is obtained all the 1000 times? Emile Borel, a famous mathematician,
  answers in the negative, with an important reservation:\n\nSuch is the sort of event
  which, though its impossibility may not be rationally demonstrable, is, however,
  so unlikely that no sensible person will hesitate to declare it actually impossible.[3]\nWhy
  `may not be rationally demonstrable'? Why does this statement remain outside the
  list of Borel's theorems in probability theory?\nMathematical truth is sharp, not
  fuzzy. Every mathematical statement is assumed to be either true or false (even
  if no one is able to decide) rather than \"basically true\", \"true for all practical
  purposes\" etc. If n heads out of n times is an impossible event for n=1000 then
  there must exist the least such n (be it known or not). Say, 665 heads can occur,
  but 666 heads cannot. Then, assuming that 665 heads have just appeared, we see that
  the next time tails is guaranteed, which contradicts to the assumed memoryless behavior
  of the coin.\nAnother example. The number 4 can be written as a sum of units: 1+1+1+1.
  Can the number 21000 be written as a sum of units?  Mathematics answers in the affirmative.
  Indeed, if you can write, say, 2665 as a sum of units, then you can do it twice
  (connecting the two copies by the plus sign). Complaints about limited resources,
  appropriate in the real world, are inappropriate in the imaginary, highly idealized
  mathematical universe.\n\nDefined or undefined\nFacts are formulated via notions.\nIn
  the non-axiomatic approach, notions are nodes of a network whose connections are
  definitions. If some notions are forgotten they probably can be restored from the
  others.\nSearching Google for \"define:line\" we get \"a length without breadth
  or thickness\". Similarly we find definitions for breadth, thickness and so on,
  recursively. Doing so we would get a large subnetwork; here is its small fragment:\n\nLine:
  a length without breadth or thickness\nLength: linear extent in space\nLinear: along
  a line↑\nExtent: a range of locations\nLocation: point or extent↑ in space\nSpace:
  unlimited expanse in which everything is located↑\nBreadth: the extent↑ from side
  to side\nSide: a surface forming part of the outside of an object\nSurface: the
  extended↑ two-dimensional outer boundary of a three-dimensional object\nThickness:
  the dimension through an object as opposed to its length↑ or width\nWidth: the extent↑
  from side↑ to side↑(Up arrows mean: see above.) We observe that\n\n circularity
  appears routinely; for example: line→length→linear→line;\n the definition of a single
  notion involves recursively a large number of other, quite remote notions.Such system
  of notions is unsuitable for a mathematical theory. Here, circularity is disallowed,
  and the set of involved notions is kept reasonably small (whenever possible). (See
  also Semantic primes for an attempt to disclose a common mathematics-like structure
  behind all natural languages.)\nIn the axiomatic approach, notions are a tower of
  defined notions, grounded on the basis of more fundamental notions called undefined
  primitives. If all defined notions are forgotten they surely can be restored from
  the undefined primitives. The undefined primitives are sparse and simple, not to
  be forgotten.\nCuriously, when a non-mathematical encyclopedia contains an article
  on a mathematical notion, two very different \"definitions\" may appear, one general
  (informal), the other mathematical (formal).\nFrom now on, in this article, \"definition\"
  means a mathematical definition (unless explicitly stated otherwise).\nThe lack
  of definition of a primitive notion does not mean lack of any information about
  this notion. Axioms provide such information, to be used in proofs. Informal (intuitive)
  understanding of a primitive notion is communicated in a natural language. This
  information cannot be used in proofs, but is instrumental when guessing what to
  prove, how to prove, how to apply proved theorems and, last but not least, what
  to postulate by axioms.\n\nMathematics is not isolated\nComputers metaphor\nA conceptual
  metaphor helps to understand one conceptual domain in terms of another. For example,
  the desktop metaphor treats the monitor of a computer as if it is the user's desktop,
  which helps to a user not accustomed to the computer. Nowadays many are more accustomed
  to computers than to mathematics. Thus, analogies with computers may help to understand
  mathematics. Such analogies are widely used below.\n\nFlexible or inflexible\nIn
  1960s a computer was an electronic monster able to read from a punch tape simple
  instructions stipulated by the hardware and execute them quickly, thus performing
  a lot of boring calculations. Nowadays some parents complain that personal computers
  are too fascinating. However, without software a personal computer is only able
  to read (say, from a compact disk) and execute instructions stipulated by the hardware.
  These instructions are now as technical as before: simple arithmetical and logical
  operations, loops, conditional execution etc. A computer is dull, be it a monster
  of 1960s or a nice looking personal computer, unless programmers develop fascinating
  combinations (called programs) of these technical instructions.\nFor a programmer,
  the instruction set of a given computer is an immutable list. The programmer cannot
  add new elements to this list, nor modify existing elements. In this sense the instruction
  set is inflexible. New programs are only new combinations of the given elements.
  Does it mean that program development is dull? In no way! A good instruction set
  is universal. It means that a competent programmer feels pretty free to implement
  any well-understood algorithm provided that the time permits (which is usually most
  problematic) and the memory and the speed of the computer are high enough (which
  is usually less problematic). In this sense a good instruction set is very flexible.\nLikewise
  a mathematician working within a given theory faces its axioms as an immutable list.
  However, this list can be universal in the sense that a competent mathematician
  feels pretty free to express any clear mathematical idea. In this sense some axiomatic
  systems are very flexible.\n\nUniversal or specialized\nFor a user, the software
  of a computer is first of all a collection of applications (games, web browsers,
  media players, word processors, image editors etc.) All applications function within
  an operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux etc.) The operating system is a universal
  infrastructure behind various specialized applications. Each application deals with
  relevant files. The operating system maintains files in general, and catalogs (directories)
  containing files and possibly other catalogs.\nLikewise, the set theory is a universal
  infrastructure behind various specialized mathematical theories (algebra, geometry,
  analysis etc.)  Each specialized mathematical theory deals with relevant objects,
  relations and sets. The sets theory deals with sets in general, possibly containing
  other sets, and reduces objects and relations to sets. Alternatively, higher-order
  logic can be used as such a universal infrastructure, more convenient for computer-assisted
  formalization of mathematics. Also category theory pretends to the throne of the
  set theory.[4]In many cases a specialized mathematical theory is a theory of mathematical
  structures of some kind, often called spaces (of this kind). For example: Euclidean
  geometry is a theory of Euclidean spaces; topology is a theory of topological spaces;
  linear algebra is a theory of linear spaces. Differential geometry investigates
  smooth manifolds. Algebra investigates groups, rings, fields etc.\n\nMotivated or
  indiscriminate\nMonkeys could type into a computer a sequence of hardware instructions;
  the computer could execute them; but the result of such \"programming\" has almost
  no chance to be fascinating or useful. Fascinating computer games reflect human
  predilections. Useful programs reflect human needs. A computer is dull for humans
  unless its software reflects human life in one way or another.\nLikewise, a theorem
  is of no interest for humans unless it is motivated in one way or another by human
  life. The motivation may be quite indirect; many theorems \"only\" help to prove
  other theorems, many are appreciated \"only\" for their aesthetic value, etc. But
  some kind of motivation is necessary. Indiscriminate stream of logical consequences
  of the axioms is not publishable in the mathematical literature.\nNote that \"a
  theorem\" does not mean \"a motivated theorem\", \"an important theorem\" etc.,
  not even \"an already discovered theorem\". All theorems are just an indiscriminate
  stream of logical consequences of the axioms.\nTheorems of a theory are, by definition,
  statements that follow from the given axioms according to the given rules (called
  by different authors inference rules, derivation rules, deduction rules, transformation
  rules), including the axioms themselves.\n\nFrom technical to human: definitions\nThe
  gap between a bare hardware and a nice application is too wide for a single jump,
  or even a triple jump (hardware – operating system – programming language – application).
  Bridging the gap is a laborious task for many programmers. They compose programs
  of modules, and modules of subroutines. Each subroutine reduces a bit more useful
  task to a bit simpler tasks. Ultimately, a useful (or even fascinating) task is
  reduced to the technical instructions of the bare hardware.\nLikewise, mathematicians
  bridge the wide gap between useful notions (say, \"ellipse\" or \"normal distribution\")
  and the undefined primitives by a large and complicated system of definitions. Each
  definition reduces a bit more useful notion to a bit more primitive notions.\nMathematical
  definitions are very diverse.\nA definition may be just an abbreviation local to
  a single calculation, like this: \"denoting for convenience  by  we have...\".\nA
  single definition may embed a whole specialized mathematical theory into the universal
  set-theoretic framework, like this:\n\"A Euclidean space consists, by definition,
  of three sets, whose elements are called points, lines and planes respectively,
  and six relations, one called betweenness, three called containment and two called
  congruence, satisfying the following conditions: ...\"\nA definition may be given
  mostly for speaking more concisely, like this: \"in a triangle, the altitude of
  a vertex is, by definition, its distance to the line through the other two vertices\".\nA
  definition may introduce a new revolutionary concept, like this: \"the derivative
  of a function at a point is, by definition, the limit of the ratio...\"\n\nSome
  mathematicians will tell you that the main aim of their research is to find the
  right definition, after which their whole area will be illuminated. ... For other
  mathematicians, the main purpose of definitions is to prove theorems... [5]\nPrinciples
  and practices\nRigor or intuition\nMathematics as a cultural process is not bound
  by monotonic logic. For example, it was treated till 1872 as intuitively evident
  fact that any curve on the plane has a tangent line everywhere except maybe a discrete
  set of points. However, this \"fact\" was refuted and retracted.\n\nA century later,
  we have seen so many monsters of this sort that we have become a little blasé. But
  the effect produced on the majority of nineteenth century mathematicians ranged
  from disgust to consternation.[6]\nSince then, intuition is not a valid argument
  in mathematical proofs. A mathematical theory is bound by monotonic logic. If needed,
  mathematics as a cultural process can retract an axiomatic theory as whole (rather
  than some theorems) and accept another axiomatic theory. (Moreover, in a remote
  perspective the axiomatic approach could be abandoned.)\n\nFormal or formalizable\nAn
  example. If  then , since . This simple algebraic argument can be checked by a human
  or even a computer. No need to understand the meaning of the statement; it is sufficient
  to know the relevant formal rules. The statement follows from the given rules only,
  rigorously, without explicit or implicit use of intuition. A formal proof guarantees
  that a theorem will never be retracted.\nA universal formal language conceived by
  Gottfried Leibniz near 1685,\n\ncapable of expressing all humans thoughts unambiguously,
  of strengthening our power of deduction, of avoiding errors by a purely mechanical
  effort of attention[7]\nwas partially implemented in mathematics two centuries later,
  especially, as a formal language of set theory. In the form introduced by Bourbaki
  this language contains four logical signs, three specific signs, and letters. Its
  rules are considerably more complicated than elementary algebra.\nHowever, this
  formal language is never used by a typical mathematician. Likewise, most programmers
  never use the instructions of the computer hardware. Instead, they develop applications
  in appropriate programming languages (BASIC, Java, C++, Python etc). A statement
  of a programming language corresponds usually to many hardware instructions; the
  correspondence is established by special programs (compilers and interpreters).
  A programming language is geared to programmers, hardware instructions --- to hardware.\nThe
  gap between the language of mathematical texts (books and articles) and the formal
  language of the set theory is even wider than the gap between a programming language
  and hardware instructions. It is as wide as the gap between pseudocode and Turing
  machines.\nA programmer, when coding a program, knows that the computer does exactly
  what it is told to do. In contrast, an author or speaker, when communicating with
  other people, can be ambiguous, make small errors, and still expect to be understood.
  Pseudocode is a description of an algorithm, intended for human reading, that can
  be converted into a code by any competent programmer. A code is formal; a pseudocode
  is formalizable.\nLikewise, communication between mathematicians is made in a formalizable
  language.\n\nIn practice, the mathematician ... is content to bring the exposition
  to a point where his experience and mathematical flair tell him that translation
  into formal language would be no more than an exercise of patience (though doubtless
  a very tedious one).[8]\nA mathematician, using a formalizable language, need not
  know all technical details of the underlying formal language. Many equivalent formal
  languages may be used interchangeably. Likewise, a single pseudocode can be used
  when coding in different programming languages, as long as these are not too far
  from each other.\n\nAxiomatic or axiomatizable\n  Two finite lists of vectors generate
  (by summation) the same infinite set of vectors. Similarly, different finite lists
  of axioms can be used for generating the same infinite set of theorems.\nA mathematician,
  working within an axiomatic theory, need not remember the list of axioms in full
  detail. It is sufficient to remember a list of theorems that contains all axioms
  or, more generally, such that each axiom follows easily from these theorems. (Here,
  as usual, \"theorems\" are treated inclusively, as \"axioms and theorems\".)\nTwo
  lists of axioms are called equivalent if every axiom of each list follows from the
  axioms of the other list. Such lists of axioms may be used interchangeably, since
  they generate the same theorems.\n\nSome details\nConsistent or inconsistent\nIf
  a theory states that 2+2=5, it is a paradox but not yet a contradiction. By \"paradox\"
  people may mean\n\na contradiction;\nan apparent contradiction;\nsomething counterintuitive;\nsomething
  surprising;\nsomething ironic;etc. In contrast, a contradiction (in a mathematical
  theory) is, by definition, a pair of theorems (of the given theory) such that one
  is the negation of the other. Thus, two theorems\n\n \n are still not a contradiction.
  Two theorems\n\n \n are a contradiction.\nIf a contradiction exists in a given theory,
  this theory is called inconsistent. Otherwise, if no contradictions exist (rather
  than merely not found for now), the theory is called consistent.\nFor a mathematician,
  an inconsistent theory is completely useless. Some philosophers disagree:\n\nSuperstitious
  dread and veneration by mathematicians in face of a contradiction[9]\nBut a mathematician
  insists: an inconsistent theory is completely useless, since all statements (in
  the given language) are theorems! The reason is, proof by contradiction.\nNo matter
  which statement X is in question, we always can prove X as follows:\n\n Assume that
  X is false;\n ... (put the proof of the contradiction here);\n the assumption leads
  to a contradiction, thus X is true.It is tempting to object that the contradiction
  has nothing in common with the assumption and therefore cannot invalidate it. However,
  the rules of formal logic do not demand that the contradiction has something in
  common with the assumption. Some attempts to change these rules were made (so-called
  \"relevance logic\", or \"relevant logic\"), but with little success. It is always
  possible to obfuscate the proof of the contradiction, making it seemingly entangled
  with X. We have no formal criterion able to unmask any possible fictitious participation
  of X in the proof of the contradiction.\nDavid Hilbert aimed to find axioms sufficient
  for all mathematics and to prove their consistency from the assumption that the
  \"finitary arithmetic\" (a subsystem of the usual arithmetic of the positive integers,
  chosen to be philosophically uncontroversial) was consistent. A fatal blow was dealt
  by the second Gödel's incompleteness theorem. Consistency of a theory cannot be
  proved by a weaker theory, nor by the same theory. It can be proved by a stronger
  theory, which does not dispel doubts: if the given theory is inconsistent then the
  stronger theory, being all the more inconsistent, can prove every claim, be it true
  or false.\nMany mathematicians feel that specialized theories, being more reliable
  than universal theories, are like watertight compartments. If a contradiction will
  be found in the used universal theory, specialized theories will separate and wait
  for a better universal theory.\n\nI have always felt that, if one day someone came
  up with a contradiction in mathematics, I would just say, \"Well, those crazy logicians
  are at it again,\" and go about my business as I was going the day before.[10]\nUnivalent
  or multivalent\nPlane geometry (called also \"planar geometry\") is a part of solid
  geometry that restricts itself to a single plane (\"the plane\") treated as a geometric
  universe. The question \"which plane?\" is inappropriate, since planes do not differ
  in their geometric properties. Every two planes α, β are isomorphic, that is, there
  exists an isomorphism f between α and β. Treating α and β as sets of points one
  defines isomorphism as an invertible (one-to-one and onto) map f : α → β preserving
  all primitive relations. Namely: f maps lines into lines; the distance between f(A)
  and f(B) on β is equal to the distance between A and B on α; etc. The same is required
  of the inverse map .\nAxioms of the plane Euclidean geometry leave no freedom, they
  determine uniquely all geometric properties of the plane. More exactly: all Euclidean
  planes are mutually isomorphic. In this sense we have \"the\" Euclidean plane. In
  terms of Bourbaki, the plane\nEuclidean geometry is an univalent theory. In contrast,
  axioms of a linear space (called also vector space) leave a freedom: a linear space
  may be one-dimensional, two-dimensional, three-dimensional, four-dimensional and
  so on (infinite dimension is also possible). Linear algebra is multivalent.\nAxioms
  of topology leave much more freedom; every subset of (say) the plane is an example
  of a topological space, be it connected or not, compact or not, be it a curve, a
  domain, a fractal, or whatever; and all these are still a minority among all topological
  spaces. Topology is multivalent.\nAccording to Bourbaki, the study of multivalent
  theories is the most striking feature which distinguishes modern mathematics from
  classical mathematics.[11]A similar idea occurs in mathematical logic: a theory
  is called categorical if all its models are mutually isomorphic. However, for Bourbaki
  a theory is embedded into the set theory, while in logic a theory is standalone
  (embedded into the first-order logic).\n\nComplete or incomplete\nA theory is called
  complete, if every statement in its language can be proved or disproved. In other
  words: if such a statement is not a theorem then its negation is necessarily a theorem.\nA
  statement (in the language of the given theory) is called independent (in other
  words, undecidable) in this theory, if it is not a theorem, but also its negation
  is not a theorem.\nIndependent statements appear naturally in multivalent theories.
  For example, in linear algebra the statement \"three vectors cannot be linearly
  independent\" is neither provable nor disprovable, since the dimension of a linear
  space may be 2 or 3 (or anything else).\nThus, multivalent theories are usually
  incomplete.\nWhat about univalent theories? Seemingly, these should be complete.
  For example, the plane Euclidean geometry should prove all geometric statements
  that hold on the Euclidean plane, and only such statements. Similarly, arithmetics
  of natural numbers should prove all true arithmetical statements about natural numbers,
  and only these. Unexpectedly, the situation is far more complicated than these naive
  ideas, see Sect. 4.7.\n\nDefinitions: abbreviations or extensions\nAccording to
  Sect. 2.4, a theorem is a logical consequence of the axioms. However, what about
  definitions? They are numerous and important, according to Sect. 2.5. Two possible
  approaches to definitions answer differently the question, whether they belong to
  the formal theory or not.\nOne approach treats definitions as abbreviations, used
  in the formalizable language and eliminated when translating into the formal language.
  Thus, the formal theory contains only primitive notions and axioms, not definitions.\nAccording
  to the other approach, each definition extends the formal theory. The new (extended)
  theory contains one more notion and one more axiom. Informally, the new notion is
  just defined, and the new axiom is just the definition. But formally, the new theory
  still contains only primitive notions and axioms, not definitions.\nAn example.\nDefinition:
  a prime number is a natural number having exactly two divisors. (These are 1 and
  the number itself, of course.)\nTheorem: there are infinitely many prime numbers.\nThe
  first approach (abbreviations). In the formal language, the notion \"prime\" is
  eliminated, as follows. Theorem: there are infinitely many natural numbers having
  exactly two divisors. The proof also does not involve the notion \"prime\".\nThe
  second approach (extensions). The new formal theory stipulates a new primitive notion
  \"prime\" and a new axiom: a natural number is prime if and only if it has exactly
  two divisors. This axiom is used in the proof of the theorem.\n\nFormalizable in
  reality or in principle\nThe integer 1 is a very simple example of a mathematical
  object that can be defined in the language of set theory. Its definition, treated
  as an abbreviation (rather than extension), can be translated from this formalizable
  language into any corresponding formal language, in particular, into the formal
  language introduced by Bourbaki. However, the length of the resulting formal definition
  is equal to 4,523,659,424,929.[12] It would take about 4000 gigabytes of computer
  memory! More complicated mathematical definitions are much longer. Clearly, such
  formalization is possible only in principle, similarly to the possibility of writing
  21000 as a sum of units.\nThis formal language is so verbose because of substitution.
  Here is an algebraic example: substituting  into  gives an expression of length
  64, containing 8 occurrences of a. Further, substitute  and you get an expression
  of length 152, containing 24 occurrences of u. And so on.\nThere exist formal mathematical
  languages intended for practical use, for example, Mizar. These treat definitions
  as extensions.\n\nGenerating all theorems; decidable or undecidable\nIt is impossible
  to list all theorems, since they are infinitely many. However, an endless algorithmic
  process can generate theorems, only theorems, and all theorems in the sense that
  every theorem will be generated, sooner or later. In more technical words: the set
  of all theorems is recursively enumerable. Some theories have infinitely many axioms
  generated by a finite list of so-called axiom schemata. Still, the set of all theorems
  is recursively enumerable, since the set of axioms is.\nAn open question (in a mathematical
  theory) is a statement neither proved nor disproved. It is possible (in principle,
  not necessarily in practice) to run the theorem-generating algorithm waiting for
  one of two events: either the given statement appears to be a theorem, or its negation
  does; in both cases the (formerly) open question is decided. If the theory is complete,
  this must happen sooner or later.\nA theory is called decidable if there exists
  an algorithm that, given an arbitrary statement (in the language of the theory)
  decides whether it is a theorem or not. (In more technical words: if the set of
  all theorems is recursive.)\nThe argument above shows that a complete theory is
  decidable.\n\nA theory as a crystal ball?\nImagine a theory able to describe the
  whole discrete mathematics (the set theory?) or, at least, arbitrary algorithmic
  computations, in other words, formal machines (like computers, but with unlimited
  resources). Assume that the theorems include all true statements about these machines,
  and no wrong statements about them. Then a formal machine can use this theory as
  a \"crystal ball\", — for predicting the future of any formal machine. In particular,
  for deciding, whether a given machine will eventually halt, or will run forever
  (so-called halting problem). To this end it runs the theorem-generating algorithm
  until either the statement \"such machine eventually halts\" or its negation appears
  among the theorems.\nIn order to predict the future of a formal machine Y, a formal
  machine X needs the code of Y. It does not mean that the code of Y must be inscribed
  into (and therefore be shorter than) the code of X. Instead, X can generate the
  code of Y. This way, a single machine X can predict the future of infinitely many
  machines Y, and moreover, of all possible machines Y, generating their codes in
  an endless loop.\nCan X predict its own future? It may seem that the affirmative
  answer is ensured by the argument above. However, how can X know, which Y is identical
  to X? In other words, how can X know (it means, be able to generate) its own code?\nIt
  is a well-known and nontrivial fact that some programs, so-called quine programs,
  can generate their own texts. (See also halting problem.) It may seem to be a trick,
  but in fact it is a form of self-replication, and it uses a 4×109 years old patent
  of life: a cell replicates itself using its DNA, and also replicates the DNA itself.\nUsing
  the quine technique, a machine X can predict its own future. Is it paradoxical?
  Seemingly not, since X is a deterministic machine, it has no free will. But nevertheless
  it is paradoxical, since we may program X as follows:\n\npredict your own future:
  whether you will eventually halt, or will run forever;\nif \"halt\" is predicted,
  enter an infinite loop;\notherwise (if \"run forever\" is predicted), halt.We get
  a paradox, which means that the assumptions made in the beginning of this section
  cannot be satisfied. An axiomatic theory cannot be such that its theorems include
  all true statements about formal machines, and no wrong statements about them! This
  important conclusion is closely related to the famous Gödel theorem.[13]\nNotes\n↑

  to a living thing, mathematics is a unity within an environment, yet apart from
  it — a compartment of a larger whole, structurally distinguishable though not functionally
  completely isolated from or closed to its surroundings.[1]There are two possible
  approaches to mathematics, called by R. Feynman \"the Babylonian tradition\" and
  \"the Greek tradition\".[2] They answer differently the question, whether or not
  some mathematical facts are more fundamental than others, more consequential facts.
  The same approaches apply to any theory, mathematical or not.\nThe Babylonian (non-axiomatic)
  tradition treats a theory as a network whose nodes are facts and connections are
  derivations. If some facts are forgotten they probably can be derived from the others.\nThe
  Greek (axiomatic) tradition treats a theory as a tower of more consequential facts
  called theorems, grounded on the basis of more fundamental facts called axioms.
  If all theorems are forgotten they surely can be derived from the axioms. The axioms
  are sparse and simple, not to be forgotten.\nThe distinction between these two approaches
  is closely related to the distinction between monotonic and non-monotonic logic.
  These answer differently the question, whether or not a fact can be retracted because
  of new evidence. Monotonic logic answers in the negative, non-monotonic logic answers
  in the affirmative.\nNon-monotonic logic is used routinely in everyday life and
  research. An example: \"being a bird, this animal should fly\", but the bird may
  appear to be a penguin. Another example: \"the grass is wet, therefore it rained\",
  but the cause may appear to be a sprinkler.\nThe non-axiomatic approach is flexible.
  When needed, some old facts can be retracted, some new facts added, and some derivations
  changed accordingly. Nowadays this approach is widely used outside mathematics,
  and only marginally within mathematics (so-called informal mathematics).\nThe axiomatic
  approach is inflexible. A theorem cannot be retracted without removing (or replacing)
  at least one axiom, which usually has dramatic consequences for many other theorems.
  Nowadays this approach is widely used in mathematics.\nThe non-axiomatic approach
  is well suited when new evidence often comes from the outside. The axiomatic approach
  is well suited for a theory that advances only by extracting new consequences from
  an immutable list of axioms. It may seem that such a development must be dull. Surprisingly,
  this is an illusion. Being inflexible in some sense, an axiomatic theory can be
  very flexible in another sense, see Sect. 2.2.\nA fair coin is tossed 1000 times;
  can it happen at random that heads is obtained all the 1000 times? Emile Borel,
  a famous mathematician, answers in the negative, with an important reservation:\nWhy
  `may not be rationally demonstrable'? Why does this statement remain outside the
  list of Borel's theorems in probability theory?\nMathematical truth is sharp, not
  fuzzy. Every mathematical statement is assumed to be either true or false (even
  if no one is able to decide) rather than \"basically true\", \"true for all practical
  purposes\" etc. If n heads out of n times is an impossible event for n=1000 then
  there must exist the least such n (be it known or not). Say, 665 heads can occur,
  but 666 heads cannot. Then, assuming that 665 heads have just appeared, we see that
  the next time tails is guaranteed, which contradicts to the assumed memoryless behavior
  of the coin.\nAnother example. The number 4 can be written as a sum of units: 1+1+1+1.
  Can the number 21000 be written as a sum of units?  Mathematics answers in the affirmative.
  Indeed, if you can write, say, 2665 as a sum of units, then you can do it twice
  (connecting the two copies by the plus sign). Complaints about limited resources,
  appropriate in the real world, are inappropriate in the imaginary, highly idealized
  mathematical universe.\nFacts are formulated via notions.\nIn the non-axiomatic
  approach, notions are nodes of a network whose connections are definitions. If some
  notions are forgotten they probably can be restored from the others.\nSearching
  Google for \"define:line\" we get \"a length without breadth or thickness\". Similarly
  we find definitions for breadth, thickness and so on, recursively. Doing so we would
  get a large subnetwork; here is its small fragment:\n(Up arrows mean: see above.)
  We observe that\nSuch system of notions is unsuitable for a mathematical theory.
  Here, circularity is disallowed, and the set of involved notions is kept reasonably
  small (whenever possible). (See also Semantic primes for an attempt to disclose
  a common mathematics-like structure behind all natural languages.)\nIn the axiomatic
  approach, notions are a tower of defined notions, grounded on the basis of more
  fundamental notions called undefined primitives. If all defined notions are forgotten
  they surely can be restored from the undefined primitives. The undefined primitives
  are sparse and simple, not to be forgotten.\nCuriously, when a non-mathematical
  encyclopedia contains an article on a mathematical notion, two very different \"definitions\"
  may appear, one general (informal), the other mathematical (formal).\nFrom now on,
  in this article, \"definition\" means a mathematical definition (unless explicitly
  stated otherwise).\nThe lack of definition of a primitive notion does not mean lack
  of any information about this notion. Axioms provide such information, to be used
  in proofs. Informal (intuitive) understanding of a primitive notion is communicated
  in a natural language. This information cannot be used in proofs, but is instrumental
  when guessing what to prove, how to prove, how to apply proved theorems and, last
  but not least, what to postulate by axioms.\nA conceptual metaphor helps to understand
  one conceptual domain in terms of another. For example, the desktop metaphor treats
  the monitor of a computer as if it is the user's desktop, which helps to a user
  not accustomed to the computer. Nowadays many are more accustomed to computers than
  to mathematics. Thus, analogies with computers may help to understand mathematics.
  Such analogies are widely used below.\nIn 1960s a computer was an electronic monster
  able to read from a punch tape simple instructions stipulated by the hardware and
  execute them quickly, thus performing a lot of boring calculations. Nowadays some
  parents complain that personal computers are too fascinating. However, without software
  a personal computer is only able to read (say, from a compact disk) and execute
  instructions stipulated by the hardware. These instructions are now as technical
  as before: simple arithmetical and logical operations, loops, conditional execution
  etc. A computer is dull, be it a monster of 1960s or a nice looking personal computer,
  unless programmers develop fascinating combinations (called programs) of these technical
  instructions.\nFor a programmer, the instruction set of a given computer is an immutable
  list. The programmer cannot add new elements to this list, nor modify existing elements.
  In this sense the instruction set is inflexible. New programs are only new combinations
  of the given elements. Does it mean that program development is dull? In no way!
  A good instruction set is universal. It means that a competent programmer feels
  pretty free to implement any well-understood algorithm provided that the time permits
  (which is usually most problematic) and the memory and the speed of the computer
  are high enough (which is usually less problematic). In this sense a good instruction
  set is very flexible.\nLikewise a mathematician working within a given theory faces
  its axioms as an immutable list. However, this list can be universal in the sense
  that a competent mathematician feels pretty free to express any clear mathematical
  idea. In this sense some axiomatic systems are very flexible.\nFor a user, the software
  of a computer is first of all a collection of applications (games, web browsers,
  media players, word processors, image editors etc.) All applications function within
  an operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux etc.) The operating system is a universal
  infrastructure behind various specialized applications. Each application deals with
  relevant files. The operating system maintains files in general, and catalogs (directories)
  containing files and possibly other catalogs.\nLikewise, the set theory is a universal
  infrastructure behind various specialized mathematical theories (algebra, geometry,
  analysis etc.)  Each specialized mathematical theory deals with relevant objects,
  relations and sets. The sets theory deals with sets in general, possibly containing
  other sets, and reduces objects and relations to sets. Alternatively, higher-order
  logic can be used as such a universal infrastructure, more convenient for computer-assisted
  formalization of mathematics. Also category theory pretends to the throne of the
  set theory.[4]In many cases a specialized mathematical theory is a theory of mathematical
  structures of some kind, often called spaces (of this kind). For example: Euclidean
  geometry is a theory of Euclidean spaces; topology is a theory of topological spaces;
  linear algebra is a theory of linear spaces. Differential geometry investigates
  smooth manifolds. Algebra investigates groups, rings, fields etc.\nMonkeys could
  type into a computer a sequence of hardware instructions; the computer could execute
  them; but the result of such \"programming\" has almost no chance to be fascinating
  or useful. Fascinating computer games reflect human predilections. Useful programs
  reflect human needs. A computer is dull for humans unless its software reflects
  human life in one way or another.\nLikewise, a theorem is of no interest for humans
  unless it is motivated in one way or another by human life. The motivation may be
  quite indirect; many theorems \"only\" help to prove other theorems, many are appreciated
  \"only\" for their aesthetic value, etc. But some kind of motivation is necessary.
  Indiscriminate stream of logical consequences of the axioms is not publishable in
  the mathematical literature.\nNote that \"a theorem\" does not mean \"a motivated
  theorem\", \"an important theorem\" etc., not even \"an already discovered theorem\".
  All theorems are just an indiscriminate stream of logical consequences of the axioms.\nTheorems
  of a theory are, by definition, statements that follow from the given axioms according
  to the given rules (called by different authors inference rules, derivation rules,
  deduction rules, transformation rules), including the axioms themselves.\nThe gap
  between a bare hardware and a nice application is too wide for a single jump, or
  even a triple jump (hardware – operating system – programming language – application).
  Bridging the gap is a laborious task for many programmers. They compose programs
  of modules, and modules of subroutines. Each subroutine reduces a bit more useful
  task to a bit simpler tasks. Ultimately, a useful (or even fascinating) task is
  reduced to the technical instructions of the bare hardware.\nLikewise, mathematicians
  bridge the wide gap between useful notions (say, \"ellipse\" or \"normal distribution\")
  and the undefined primitives by a large and complicated system of definitions. Each
  definition reduces a bit more useful notion to a bit more primitive notions.\nMathematical
  definitions are very diverse.\nA definition may be just an abbreviation local to
  a single calculation, like this: \"denoting for convenience  by  we have...\".\nA
  single definition may embed a whole specialized mathematical theory into the universal
  set-theoretic framework, like this:\n\"A Euclidean space consists, by definition,
  of three sets, whose elements are called points, lines and planes respectively,
  and six relations, one called betweenness, three called containment and two called
  congruence, satisfying the following conditions: ...\"\nA definition may be given
  mostly for speaking more concisely, like this: \"in a triangle, the altitude of
  a vertex is, by definition, its distance to the line through the other two vertices\".\nA
  definition may introduce a new revolutionary concept, like this: \"the derivative
  of a function at a point is, by definition, the limit of the ratio...\"\nMathematics
  as a cultural process is not bound by monotonic logic. For example, it was treated
  till 1872 as intuitively evident fact that any curve on the plane has a tangent
  line everywhere except maybe a discrete set of points. However, this \"fact\" was
  refuted and retracted.\nSince then, intuition is not a valid argument in mathematical
  proofs. A mathematical theory is bound by monotonic logic. If needed, mathematics
  as a cultural process can retract an axiomatic theory as whole (rather than some
  theorems) and accept another axiomatic theory. (Moreover, in a remote perspective
  the axiomatic approach could be abandoned.)\nAn example. If  then , since . This
  simple algebraic argument can be checked by a human or even a computer. No need
  to understand the meaning of the statement; it is sufficient to know the relevant
  formal rules. The statement follows from the given rules only, rigorously, without
  explicit or implicit use of intuition. A formal proof guarantees that a theorem
  will never be retracted.\nA universal formal language conceived by Gottfried Leibniz
  near 1685,\nwas partially implemented in mathematics two centuries later, especially,
  as a formal language of set theory. In the form introduced by Bourbaki this language
  contains four logical signs, three specific signs, and letters. Its rules are considerably
  more complicated than elementary algebra.\nHowever, this formal language is never
  used by a typical mathematician. Likewise, most programmers never use the instructions
  of the computer hardware. Instead, they develop applications in appropriate programming
  languages (BASIC, Java, C++, Python etc). A statement of a programming language
  corresponds usually to many hardware instructions; the correspondence is established
  by special programs (compilers and interpreters). A programming language is geared
  to programmers, hardware instructions --- to hardware.\nThe gap between the language
  of mathematical texts (books and articles) and the formal language of the set theory
  is even wider than the gap between a programming language and hardware instructions.
  It is as wide as the gap between pseudocode and Turing machines.\nA programmer,
  when coding a program, knows that the computer does exactly what it is told to do.
  In contrast, an author or speaker, when communicating with other people, can be
  ambiguous, make small errors, and still expect to be understood. Pseudocode is a
  description of an algorithm, intended for human reading, that can be converted into
  a code by any competent programmer. A code is formal; a pseudocode is formalizable.\nLikewise,
  communication between mathematicians is made in a formalizable language.\nA mathematician,
  using a formalizable language, need not know all technical details of the underlying
  formal language. Many equivalent formal languages may be used interchangeably. Likewise,
  a single pseudocode can be used when coding in different programming languages,
  as long as these are not too far from each other.\nA mathematician, working within
  an axiomatic theory, need not remember the list of axioms in full detail. It is
  sufficient to remember a list of theorems that contains all axioms or, more generally,
  such that each axiom follows easily from these theorems. (Here, as usual, \"theorems\"
  are treated inclusively, as \"axioms and theorems\".)\nTwo lists of axioms are called
  equivalent if every axiom of each list follows from the axioms of the other list.
  Such lists of axioms may be used interchangeably, since they generate the same theorems.\nIf
  a theory states that 2+2=5, it is a paradox but not yet a contradiction. By \"paradox\"
  people may mean\netc. In contrast, a contradiction (in a mathematical theory) is,
  by definition, a pair of theorems (of the given theory) such that one is the negation
  of the other. Thus, two theorems\nare still not a contradiction. Two theorems\nare
  a contradiction.\nIf a contradiction exists in a given theory, this theory is called
  inconsistent. Otherwise, if no contradictions exist (rather than merely not found
  for now), the theory is called consistent.\nFor a mathematician, an inconsistent
  theory is completely useless. Some philosophers disagree:\nBut a mathematician insists:
  an inconsistent theory is completely useless, since all statements (in the given
  language) are theorems! The reason is, proof by contradiction.\nNo matter which
  statement X is in question, we always can prove X as follows:\nIt is tempting to
  object that the contradiction has nothing in common with the assumption and therefore
  cannot invalidate it. However, the rules of formal logic do not demand that the
  contradiction has something in common with the assumption. Some attempts to change
  these rules were made (so-called \"relevance logic\", or \"relevant logic\"), but
  with little success. It is always possible to obfuscate the proof of the contradiction,
  making it seemingly entangled with X. We have no formal criterion able to unmask
  any possible fictitious participation of X in the proof of the contradiction.\nDavid
  Hilbert aimed to find axioms sufficient for all mathematics and to prove their consistency
  from the assumption that the \"finitary arithmetic\" (a subsystem of the usual arithmetic
  of the positive integers, chosen to be philosophically uncontroversial) was consistent.
  A fatal blow was dealt by the second Gödel's incompleteness theorem. Consistency
  of a theory cannot be proved by a weaker theory, nor by the same theory. It can
  be proved by a stronger theory, which does not dispel doubts: if the given theory
  is inconsistent then the stronger theory, being all the more inconsistent, can prove
  every claim, be it true or false.\nMany mathematicians feel that specialized theories,
  being more reliable than universal theories, are like watertight compartments. If
  a contradiction will be found in the used universal theory, specialized theories
  will separate and wait for a better universal theory.\nPlane geometry (called also
  \"planar geometry\") is a part of solid geometry that restricts itself to a single
  plane (\"the plane\") treated as a geometric universe. The question \"which plane?\"
  is inappropriate, since planes do not differ in their geometric properties. Every
  two planes α, β are isomorphic, that is, there exists an isomorphism f between α
  and β. Treating α and β as sets of points one defines isomorphism as an invertible
  (one-to-one and onto) map f : α → β preserving all primitive relations. Namely:
  f maps lines into lines; the distance between f(A) and f(B) on β is equal to the
  distance between A and B on α; etc. The same is required of the inverse map .\nAxioms
  of the plane Euclidean geometry leave no freedom, they determine uniquely all geometric
  properties of the plane. More exactly: all Euclidean planes are mutually isomorphic.
  In this sense we have \"the\" Euclidean plane. In terms of Bourbaki, the plane\nEuclidean
  geometry is an univalent theory. In contrast, axioms of a linear space (called also
  vector space) leave a freedom: a linear space may be one-dimensional, two-dimensional,
  three-dimensional, four-dimensional and so on (infinite dimension is also possible).
  Linear algebra is multivalent.\nAxioms of topology leave much more freedom; every
  subset of (say) the plane is an example of a topological space, be it connected
  or not, compact or not, be it a curve, a domain, a fractal, or whatever; and all
  these are still a minority among all topological spaces. Topology is multivalent.\nAccording
  to Bourbaki, the study of multivalent theories is the most striking feature which
  distinguishes modern mathematics from classical mathematics.[11]A similar idea occurs
  in mathematical logic: a theory is called categorical if all its models are mutually
  isomorphic. However, for Bourbaki a theory is embedded into the set theory, while
  in logic a theory is standalone (embedded into the first-order logic).\nA theory
  is called complete, if every statement in its language can be proved or disproved.
  In other words: if such a statement is not a theorem then its negation is necessarily
  a theorem.\nA statement (in the language of the given theory) is called independent
  (in other words, undecidable) in this theory, if it is not a theorem, but also its
  negation is not a theorem.\nIndependent statements appear naturally in multivalent
  theories. For example, in linear algebra the statement \"three vectors cannot be
  linearly independent\" is neither provable nor disprovable, since the dimension
  of a linear space may be 2 or 3 (or anything else).\nThus, multivalent theories
  are usually incomplete.\nWhat about univalent theories? Seemingly, these should
  be complete. For example, the plane Euclidean geometry should prove all geometric
  statements that hold on the Euclidean plane, and only such statements. Similarly,
  arithmetics of natural numbers should prove all true arithmetical statements about
  natural numbers, and only these. Unexpectedly, the situation is far more complicated
  than these naive ideas, see Sect. 4.7.\nAccording to Sect. 2.4, a theorem is a logical
  consequence of the axioms. However, what about definitions? They are numerous and
  important, according to Sect. 2.5. Two possible approaches to definitions answer
  differently the question, whether they belong to the formal theory or not.\nOne
  approach treats definitions as abbreviations, used in the formalizable language
  and eliminated when translating into the formal language. Thus, the formal theory
  contains only primitive notions and axioms, not definitions.\nAccording to the other
  approach, each definition extends the formal theory. The new (extended) theory contains
  one more notion and one more axiom. Informally, the new notion is just defined,
  and the new axiom is just the definition. But formally, the new theory still contains
  only primitive notions and axioms, not definitions.\nAn example.\nDefinition: a
  prime number is a natural number having exactly two divisors. (These are 1 and the
  number itself, of course.)\nTheorem: there are infinitely many prime numbers.\nThe
  first approach (abbreviations). In the formal language, the notion \"prime\" is
  eliminated, as follows. Theorem: there are infinitely many natural numbers having
  exactly two divisors. The proof also does not involve the notion \"prime\".\nThe
  second approach (extensions). The new formal theory stipulates a new primitive notion
  \"prime\" and a new axiom: a natural number is prime if and only if it has exactly
  two divisors. This axiom is used in the proof of the theorem.\nThe integer 1 is
  a very simple example of a mathematical object that can be defined in the language
  of set theory. Its definition, treated as an abbreviation (rather than extension),
  can be translated from this formalizable language into any corresponding formal
  language, in particular, into the formal language introduced by Bourbaki. However,
  the length of the resulting formal definition is equal to 4,523,659,424,929.[12]
  It would take about 4000 gigabytes of computer memory! More complicated mathematical
  definitions are much longer. Clearly, such formalization is possible only in principle,
  similarly to the possibility of writing 21000 as a sum of units.\nThis formal language
  is so verbose because of substitution. Here is an algebraic example: substituting
  \ into  gives an expression of length 64, containing 8 occurrences of a. Further,
  substitute  and you get an expression of length 152, containing 24 occurrences of
  u. And so on.\nThere exist formal mathematical languages intended for practical
  use, for example, Mizar. These treat definitions as extensions.\nIt is impossible
  to list all theorems, since they are infinitely many. However, an endless algorithmic
  process can generate theorems, only theorems, and all theorems in the sense that
  every theorem will be generated, sooner or later. In more technical words: the set
  of all theorems is recursively enumerable. Some theories have infinitely many axioms
  generated by a finite list of so-called axiom schemata. Still, the set of all theorems
  is recursively enumerable, since the set of axioms is.\nAn open question (in a mathematical
  theory) is a statement neither proved nor disproved. It is possible (in principle,
  not necessarily in practice) to run the theorem-generating algorithm waiting for
  one of two events: either the given statement appears to be a theorem, or its negation
  does; in both cases the (formerly) open question is decided. If the theory is complete,
  this must happen sooner or later.\nA theory is called decidable if there exists
  an algorithm that, given an arbitrary statement (in the language of the theory)
  decides whether it is a theorem or not. (In more technical words: if the set of
  all theorems is recursive.)\nThe argument above shows that a complete theory is
  decidable.\nImagine a theory able to describe the whole discrete mathematics (the
  set theory?) or, at least, arbitrary algorithmic computations, in other words, formal
  machines (like computers, but with unlimited resources). Assume that the theorems
  include all true statements about these machines, and no wrong statements about
  them. Then a formal machine can use this theory as a \"crystal ball\", — for predicting
  the future of any formal machine. In particular, for deciding, whether a given machine
  will eventually halt, or will run forever (so-called halting problem). To this end
  it runs the theorem-generating algorithm until either the statement \"such machine
  eventually halts\" or its negation appears among the theorems.\nIn order to predict
  the future of a formal machine Y, a formal machine X needs the code of Y. It does
  not mean that the code of Y must be inscribed into (and therefore be shorter than)
  the code of X. Instead, X can generate the code of Y. This way, a single machine
  X can predict the future of infinitely many machines Y, and moreover, of all possible
  machines Y, generating their codes in an endless loop.\nCan X predict its own future?
  It may seem that the affirmative answer is ensured by the argument above. However,
  how can X know, which Y is identical to X? In other words, how can X know (it means,
  be able to generate) its own code?\nIt is a well-known and nontrivial fact that
  some programs, so-called quine programs, can generate their own texts. (See also
  halting problem.) It may seem to be a trick, but in fact it is a form of self-replication,
  and it uses a 4×109 years old patent of life: a cell replicates itself using its
  DNA, and also replicates the DNA itself.\nUsing the quine technique, a machine X
  can predict its own future. Is it paradoxical? Seemingly not, since X is a deterministic
  machine, it has no free will. But nevertheless it is paradoxical, since we may program
  X as follows:\nWe get a paradox, which means that the assumptions made in the beginning
  of this section cannot be satisfied. An axiomatic theory cannot be such that its
  theorems include all true statements about formal machines, and no wrong statements
  about them! This important conclusion is closely related to the famous Gödel theorem.[13]Borel,
