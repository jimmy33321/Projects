- "The late 19th-century United States is probably best known for the vast expansion
  of its industrial plant and output. At the heart of these huge increases was the
  mass production of goods by machines. This process was first introduced and perfected
  by British textile manufacturers.\r\n"
- "In the century since such mechanization had begun, machines had replaced highly
  skilled craftspeople in one industry after another. By the 1870s, machines were
  knitting stockings and stitching shirts and dresses, cutting and stitching leather
  for shoes, and producing nails by the millions. By reducing labor costs, such machines
  not only reduced manufacturing costs but lowered prices manufacturers charged consumers.
  In short, machine production created a growing abundance of products at cheaper
  prices.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "Mechanization also had less desirable effects. For one, machines changed the way
  people worked. Skilled craftspeople of earlier days had the satisfaction of seeing
  a product through from beginning to end. When they saw a knife, or barrel, or shirt
  or dress, they had a sense of accomplishment. Machines, on the other hand, tended
  to subdivide production down into many small repetitive tasks with workers often
  doing only a single task. The pace of work usually became faster and faster; work
  was often performed in factories built to house the machines. Finally, factory managers
  began to enforce an industrial discipline, forcing workers to work set--often very
  long--hours.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "One result of mechanization and factory production was the growing attractiveness
  of labor organization. To be sure, craft guilds had been around a long time. Now,
  however, there were increasing reasons for workers to join labor unions. Such labor
  unions were not notably successful in organizing large numbers of workers in the
  late 19th century. Still, unions were able to organize a variety of strikes and
  other work stoppages that served to publicize their grievances about working conditions
  and wages. Even so, labor unions did not gain even close to equal footing with businesses
  and industries until the economic chaos of the 1930s.\r\n"

  Gin at Dahomey, between 1890 and 1906Detroit Publishing Company\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late
  19th-century United States is probably best known for the vast expansion of its
  industrial plant and output. At the heart of these huge increases was the mass production
  of goods by machines. This process was first introduced and perfected by British
  textile manufacturers.\r\nIn the century since such mechanization had begun, machines
  had replaced highly skilled craftspeople in one industry after another. By the 1870s,
  machines were knitting stockings and stitching shirts and dresses, cutting and stitching
  leather for shoes, and producing nails by the millions. By reducing labor costs,
  such machines not only reduced manufacturing costs but lowered prices manufacturers
  charged consumers. In short, machine production created a growing abundance of products
  at cheaper prices.\r\n\r\nMechanization also had less desirable effects. For one,
  machines changed the way people worked. Skilled craftspeople of earlier days had
  the satisfaction of seeing a product through from beginning to end. When they saw
  a knife, or barrel, or shirt or dress, they had a sense of accomplishment. Machines,
  on the other hand, tended to subdivide production down into many small repetitive
  tasks with workers often doing only a single task. The pace of work usually became
  faster and faster; work was often performed in factories built to house the machines.
  Finally, factory managers began to enforce an industrial discipline, forcing workers

  Gin at Dahomey, between 1890 and 1906Detroit Publishing CompanyThe late 19th-century
  United States is probably best known for the vast expansion of its industrial plant
  and output. At the heart of these huge increases was the mass production of goods
  by machines. This process was first introduced and perfected by British textile
  manufacturers.In the century since such mechanization had begun, machines had replaced
  highly skilled craftspeople in one industry after another. By the 1870s, machines
  were knitting stockings and stitching shirts and dresses, cutting and stitching
  leather for shoes, and producing nails by the millions. By reducing labor costs,
  such machines not only reduced manufacturing costs but lowered prices manufacturers
  charged consumers. In short, machine production created a growing abundance of products
  at cheaper prices.Mechanization also had less desirable effects. For one, machines
  changed the way people worked. Skilled craftspeople of earlier days had the satisfaction
  of seeing a product through from beginning to end. When they saw a knife, or barrel,
  or shirt or dress, they had a sense of accomplishment. Machines, on the other hand,
  tended to subdivide production down into many small repetitive tasks with workers
  often doing only a single task. The pace of work usually became faster and faster;
  work was often performed in factories built to house the machines. Finally, factory
  managers began to enforce an industrial discipline, forcing workers to work set--often
  very long--hours.One result of mechanization and factory production was the growing
  attractiveness of labor organization. To be sure, craft guilds had been around a
  long time. Now, however, there were increasing reasons for workers to join labor
  unions. Such labor unions were not notably successful in organizing large numbers
  of workers in the late 19th century. Still, unions were able to organize a variety
  of strikes and other work stoppages that served to publicize their grievances about
  working conditions and wages. Even so, labor unions did not gain even close to equal
  footing with businesses and industries until the economic chaos of the 1930s.To
