  Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics.
- |
  Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure, Noam Chomsky and William C. Stokoe.
- |
  Estimates of the number of languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on a partly arbitrary distinction between languages and dialects. Natural languages are spoken or signed, but any language can be encoded into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli – for example, in graphic writing, braille, or whistling. This is because human language is modality-independent. Depending on philosophical perspectives regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, "language" may refer to the cognitive ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. All languages rely on the process of semiosis to relate signs to particular meanings. Oral and sign languages contain a phonological system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or morphemes, and a syntactic system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances.

  Human language has the properties of productivity, recursivity, and displacement, and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of animal communication. Language is thought to have originated when early hominins started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a theory of other minds and a shared intentionality.[1][2] This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the human brain, but especially in Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently when they are approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human culture. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group identity, social stratification, as well as social grooming and entertainment.
- |
  Languages evolve and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family. The Indo-European family is the most widely spoken and includes English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, and Hindi; the Sino-Tibetan family, which includes Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, and Standard Tibetan; the Afro-Asiatic family, which includes Arabic, Amharic, Somali, and Hebrew; the Bantu languages, which include Swahili, Zulu, Shona, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout Africa; and the Malayo-Polynesian languages, which include Indonesian, Malay, Tagalog, Malagasy, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the Pacific. The languages of the Dravidian family that are spoken mostly in Southern India include Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become extinct by the year 2100.

  Definitions[edit]
- |
  Main article: Philosophy of language
- |
  The English word language derives ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *dn̥ǵʰwéh₂s "tongue, speech, language" through Latin lingua, "language; tongue", and Old French language.[3] The word is sometimes used to refer to codes, ciphers, and other kinds of artificially constructed communication systems such as formally defined computer languages used for computer programming. Unlike conventional human languages, a formal language in this sense is a system of signs for encoding and decoding information. This article specifically concerns the properties of natural human language as it is studied in the discipline of linguistics.
- |
  As an object of linguistic study, "language" has two primary meanings: an abstract concept, and a specific linguistic system, e.g. "French". The Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, who defined the modern discipline of linguistics, first explicitly formulated the distinction using the French word langage for language as a concept, langue as a specific instance of a language system, and parole for the concrete usage of speech in a particular language.[4]
- |
  When speaking of language as a general concept, definitions can be used which stress different aspects of the phenomenon.[5] These definitions also entail different approaches and understandings of language, and they inform different and often incompatible schools of linguistic theory.[6] Debates about the nature and origin of language go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as Gorgias and Plato debated the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication and truth were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and prior to, language.[7]
- |
  During the Enlightenment and its debates about human origins, it became fashionable to speculate about the origin of language. Thinkers such as Rousseau and Herder argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and Descartes held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world – asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led to the question of whether philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the linguistic turn and philosophers such as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.[8]

  Mental faculty, organ or instinct[edit]
- |
  One definition sees language primarily as the mental faculty that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and to produce and understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the human brain. Proponents of the view that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, creole languages and spontaneously developed sign languages such as Nicaraguan Sign Language. This view, which can be traced back to the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely innate, for example, in Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar, or American philosopher Jerry Fodor's extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a cognitive science framework and in neurolinguistics.[9][10]
- |
  Formal symbolic system[edit]
- |
  Another definition sees language as a formal system of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages can be described as closed structural systems consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings.[11] This structuralist view of language was first introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure,[12] and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.[13]
- |
  Some proponents of Saussure's view of language have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements and then by presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is Noam Chomsky, the originator of the generative theory of grammar, who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars.[14] Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature of the human mind and to constitute the rudiments of what language is.[15] By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in formal logic, in formal theories of grammar, and in applied computational linguistics.[16][17] In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as Alfred Tarski, Bertrand Russell, and other formal logicians.

  Yet another definition sees language as a system of communication that enables humans to exchange verbal or symbolic utterances. This definition stresses the social functions of language and the fact that humans use it to express themselves and to manipulate objects in their environment. Functional theories of grammar explain grammatical structures by their communicative functions, and understand the grammatical structures of language to be the result of an adaptive process by which grammar was "tailored" to serve the communicative needs of its users.[18][19]
- |
  This view of language is associated with the study of language in pragmatic, cognitive, and interactive frameworks, as well as in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of linguistic typology, or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of grammaticalization tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology.[17] In the philosophy of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with Wittgenstein's later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as J. L. Austin, Paul Grice, John Searle, and W. O. Quine.[20]

  Unique status of human language[edit]
- |
  Main articles: Animal language and Great ape language
- |
  Human language is unique in comparison to other forms of communication, such as those used by non-human animals. Communication systems used by other animals such as bees or apes are closed systems that consist of a finite, usually very limited, number of possible ideas that can be expressed.[21]
- |
  In contrast, human language is open-ended and productive, meaning that it allows humans to produce a vast range of utterances from a finite set of elements, and to create new words and sentences. This is possible because human language is based on a dual code, in which a finite number of elements which are meaningless in themselves (e.g. sounds, letters or gestures) can be combined to form a theoretically infinite number of larger units of meaning (words and sentences).[22] Furthermore, the symbols and grammatical rules of any particular language are largely arbitrary, so that the system can only be acquired through social interaction.[23] The known systems of communication used by animals, on the other hand, can only express a finite number of utterances that are mostly genetically determined.[24]
- |
  Several species of animals have proved to be able to acquire forms of communication through social learning: for instance a bonobo named Kanzi learned to express itself using a set of symbolic lexigrams. Similarly, many species of birds and whales learn their songs by imitating other members of their species. However, while some animals may acquire large numbers of words and symbols,[note 1] none have been able to learn as many different signs as are generally known by an average 4 year old human, nor have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language.[25]
- |
  Human languages also differ from animal communication systems in that they employ grammatical and semantic categories, such as noun and verb, present and past, which may be used to express exceedingly complex meanings.[25] Human language is also unique in having the property of recursivity: for example, a noun phrase can contain another noun phrase (as in "[[the chimpanzee]'s lips]") or a clause can contain another clause (as in "[I see [the dog is running]]").[2] Human language is also the only known natural communication system whose adaptability may be referred to as modality independent. This means that it can be used not only for communication through one channel or medium, but through several. For example, spoken language uses the auditive modality, whereas sign languages and writing use the visual modality, and braille writing uses the tactile modality.[26]
- |
  Human language is also unique in being able to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events that took place in the past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called displacement, and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of bees that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human language is also considered unique.[22]

  Humans have speculated about the origins of language throughout history. The Biblical myth of the Tower of Babel is one such account; other cultures have different stories of how language arose.[27]

  Theories about the origin of language differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are based on the idea that language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on Chomsky's generative view of language see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.[28]
- |
  The only prominent proponent of a discontinuity-based theory of human language origins is linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky.[28] Chomsky proposes that "some random mutation took place, maybe after some strange cosmic ray shower, and it reorganized the brain, implanting a language organ in an otherwise primate brain."[29] Though cautioning against taking this story too literally, Chomsky insists that "it may be closer to reality than many other fairy tales that are told about evolutionary processes, including language."[29]
- |
  Continuity-based theories are held by a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Those who see language as being mostly innate, for example psychologist Steven Pinker, hold the precedents to be animal cognition,[10] whereas those who see language as a socially learned tool of communication, such as psychologist Michael Tomasello, see it as having developed from animal communication in primates: either gestural or vocal communication to assist in cooperation.[24] Other continuity-based models see language as having developed from music, a view already espoused by Rousseau, Herder, Humboldt, and Charles Darwin. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist Steven Mithen.[30]Stephen Anderson states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000 years[31] and that:
- |2+

- |
  Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only once, and that all modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can no longer be recovered ... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction.[32]
- |2+

- |
  Because language emerged in the early prehistory of man, its early development has left no historical traces, and it is believed that no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a larynx capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.[33]
- |
  It is mostly undisputed that pre-human australopithecines did not have communication systems significantly different from those found in great apes in general, but scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of the genus Homo some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (proto-language) as early as Homo habilis (2.3 million years ago) while others place the development of primitive symbolic communication only with Homo erectus (1.8 million years ago) or Homo heidelbergensis (0.6 million years ago), and the development of language proper with Anatomically Modern Homo sapiens with the Upper Paleolithic revolution less than 100,000 years ago.[34][35]

  Main articles: Linguistics and History of linguistics

  The study of language, linguistics, has been developing into a science since the first grammatical descriptions of particular languages in India more than 2000 years ago. Modern linguistics is a science that concerns itself with all aspects of language, examining it from all of the theoretical viewpoints described above.[36]
- |
  Subdisciplines[edit]
- |
  The academic study of language is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles, all of which inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, descriptive linguistics examines the grammar of single languages, theoretical linguistics develops theories on how best to conceptualize and define the nature of language based on data from the various extant human languages, sociolinguistics studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions of language and grammatical description, neurolinguistics studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, computational linguistics builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses, and historical linguistics relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language families by using the comparative method.[37]
- |
  Early history[edit]
- |
  The formal study of language is often considered to have started in India with Pāṇini, the 5th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of Sanskrit morphology. However, Sumerian scribes already studied the differences between Sumerian and Akkadian grammar around 1900 BC. Subsequent grammatical traditions developed in all of the ancient cultures that adopted writing.[38]

  In the 17th century AD, the French Port-Royal Grammarians developed the idea that the grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics of thought, and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of the comparative method by British philologist and expert on ancient India William Jones sparked the rise of comparative linguistics.[39] The scientific study of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by Wilhelm von Humboldt. Early in the 20th century, Ferdinand de Saussure introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them.[12]
- |
  By introducing a distinction between diachronic and synchronic analyses of language, he laid the foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between syntagm and paradigm, and the Langue-parole distinction, distinguishing language as an abstract system (langue), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (parole).[40]

  Contemporary linguistics[edit]
- |
  In the 1960s, Noam Chomsky formulated the generative theory of language. According to this theory, the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called Universal Grammar; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.[41]
- |
  In opposition to the formal theories of the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. Formal theories of grammar seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out.[17][note 2] The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.[42]

  Physiological and neural architecture of language and speech[edit]
- |
  Speaking is the default modality for language in all cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus, the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring and producing language.[43] The study of the genetic bases for human language is at an early stage: the only gene that has definitely been implicated in language production is FOXP2, which may cause a kind of congenital language disorder if affected by mutations.[44]

  The brain is the coordinating center of all linguistic activity; it controls both the production of linguistic cognition and of meaning and the mechanics of speech production. Nonetheless, our knowledge of the neurological bases for language is quite limited, though it has advanced considerably with the use of modern imaging techniques. The discipline of linguistics dedicated to studying the neurological aspects of language is called neurolinguistics.[45]
- |
  Early work in neurolinguistics involved the study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which is located in the posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition in which there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out.[46] They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.[47][48]

  With technological advances in the late 20th century, neurolinguists have also incorporated non-invasive techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiology to study language processing in individuals without impairments.[45]

  Spoken language relies on human physical ability to produce sound, which is a longitudinal wave propagated through the air at a frequency capable of vibrating the ear drum. This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box (larynx), and the upper vocal tract – the throat, the mouth, and the nose. By controlling the different parts of the speech apparatus, the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.[49]
- |
  The sound of speech can be analyzed into a combination of segmental and suprasegmental elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which are a result of their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as stress, phonation type, voice timbre, and prosody or intonation, all of which may have effects across multiple segments.[50]
- |
  Consonants and vowel segments combine to form syllables, which in turn combine to form utterances; these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations. Acoustically, these different segments are characterized by different formant structures, that are visible in a spectrogram of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram of the formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.[50][51]
- |
  Vowels are those sounds that have no audible friction caused by the narrowing or obstruction of some part of the upper vocal tract. They vary in quality according to the degree of lip aperture and the placement of the tongue within the oral cavity.[50] Vowels are called close when the lips are relatively closed, as in the pronunciation of the vowel [i] (English "ee"), or open when the lips are relatively open, as in the vowel [a] (English "ah"). If the tongue is located towards the back of the mouth, the quality changes, creating vowels such as [u] (English "oo"). The quality also changes depending on whether the lips are rounded as opposed to unrounded, creating distinctions such as that between [i] (unrounded front vowel such as English "ee") and [y] (rounded front vowel such as German "ü").[52]
- |
  Consonants are those sounds that have audible friction or closure at some point within the upper vocal tract. Consonant sounds vary by place of articulation, i.e. the place in the vocal tract where the airflow is obstructed, commonly at the lips, teeth, alveolar ridge, palate, velum, uvula, or glottis. Each place of articulation produces a different set of consonant sounds, which are further distinguished by manner of articulation, or the kind of friction, whether full closure, in which case the consonant is called occlusive or stop, or different degrees of aperture creating fricatives and approximants. Consonants can also be either voiced or unvoiced, depending on whether the vocal cords are set in vibration by airflow during the production of the sound. Voicing is what separates English [s] in bus (unvoiced sibilant) from [z] in buzz (voiced sibilant).[53]
- |
  Some speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve release of air flow through the nasal cavity, and these are called nasals or nasalized sounds. Other sounds are defined by the way the tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called laterals, because the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds (called rhotics) that are characterized by how the tongue is positioned relative to the air stream.[51]
- |
  By using these speech organs, humans can produce hundreds of distinct sounds: some appear very often in the world's languages, whereas others are much more common in certain language families, language areas, or even specific to a single language.[54]
- |
  Structure[edit]
- |
  When described as a system of symbolic communication, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: signs, meanings, and a code connecting signs with their meanings. The study of the process of semiosis, how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called semiotics. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.[55]

  Some of the properties that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign, meaning that there is no predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, meaning that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases; the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the linguistic system, meaning that the finite number of linguistic elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.[55]
- |
  The rules by which signs can be combined to form words and phrases are called syntax or grammar. The meaning that is connected to individual signs, morphemes, words, phrases, and texts is called semantics.[56] The division of language into separate but connected systems of sign and meaning goes back to the first linguistic studies of de Saussure and is now used in almost all branches of linguistics.[57]
- |
  Semantics[edit]
- |
  Main articles: Semantics, Semiotics and Meaning (linguistics)
- |
  Languages express meaning by relating a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must be something that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, in the sense that the convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.
- |
  Thus, languages must have a vocabulary of signs related to specific meaning. The English sign "dog" denotes, for example, a member of the species Canis familiaris. In a language, the array of arbitrary signs connected to specific meanings is called the lexicon, and a single sign connected to a meaning is called a lexeme. Not all meanings in a language are represented by single words. Often, semantic concepts are embedded in the morphology or syntax of the language in the form of grammatical categories.[58]
- |
  All languages contain the semantic structure of predication: a structure that predicates a property, state, or action. Traditionally, semantics has been understood to be the study of how speakers and interpreters assign truth values to statements, so that meaning is understood to be the process by which a predicate can be said to be true or false about an entity, e.g. "[x [is y]]" or "[x [does y]]". Recently, this model of semantics has been complemented with more dynamic models of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the context in which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning. Such models of meaning are explored in the field of pragmatics.[58]

  Depending on modality, language structure can be based on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in phonology.[59] The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called phonetics.[60] In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds become part of a system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, only a limited number of the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.[54]
- |
  Sounds as part of a linguistic system are called phonemes.[61] Phonemes are abstract units of sound, defined as the smallest units in a language that can serve to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally different words, a so-called minimal pair. In English, for example, the words bat [bæt] and pat [pʰæt] form a minimal pair, in which the distinction between /b/ and /p/ differentiates the two words, which have different meanings. However, each language contrasts sounds in different ways. For example, in a language that does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants, the sounds [p] and [b] (if they both occur) could be considered a single phoneme, and consequently, the two pronunciations would have the same meaning. Similarly, the English language does not distinguish phonemically between aspirated and non-aspirated pronunciations of consonants, as many other languages do: the unaspirated /p/ in spin [spɪn] and the aspirated /p/ in pin [pʰɪn] are considered to be merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme (such variants of a single phoneme are called allophones), whereas in Mandarin Chinese, the same difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words [pʰá] 'crouch' and [pá] 'eight' (the accent above the á means that the vowel is pronounced with a high tone).[62]
- |
  All spoken languages have phonemes of at least two different categories, vowels and consonants, that can be combined to form syllables.[50] As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use stress, pitch, duration, and tone to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments, they are called suprasegmental.[63] Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example, Rotokas and Pirahã language with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like Taa may have as many as 141 phonemes.[62] In sign languages, the equivalent to phonemes (formerly called cheremes) are defined by the basic elements of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.[64][65][66]
- |
  Writing systems represent language using visual symbols, which may or may not correspond to the sounds of spoken language. The Latin alphabet (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the Inuktitut syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In logographic scripts, each sign represents an entire word,[67] and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in spoken language.
- |
  Because all languages have a very large number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the Arabic script), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.[68]
- |
  In order to represent the sounds of the world's languages in writing, linguists have developed the International Phonetic Alphabet, designed to represent all of the discrete sounds that are known to contribute to meaning in human languages.[69]

  Grammar[edit]
- |
  Main article: Grammar
- |
  Grammar is the study of how meaningful elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.[70]
- |
  Grammatical categories[edit]
- |
  Main article: Grammatical category
- |
  Grammar can be described as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning.[71] Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing between their relations to a predicate, the encoding of temporal and spatial relations on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.[72]
- |
  Word classes[edit]
- |
  Languages organize their parts of speech into classes according to their functions and positions relative to other parts. All languages, for instance, make a basic distinction between a group of words that prototypically denotes things and concepts and a group of words that prototypically denotes actions and events. The first group, which includes English words such as "dog" and "song", are usually called nouns. The second, which includes "run" and "sing", are called verbs. Another common category is the adjective: words that describe properties or qualities of nouns, such as "red" or "big". Word classes can be "open" if new words can continuously be added to the class, or relatively "closed" if there is a fixed number of words in a class. In English, the class of pronouns is closed, whereas the class of adjectives is open, since an infinite number of adjectives can be constructed from verbs (e.g. "saddened") or nouns (e.g. with the -like suffix, as in "noun-like"). In other languages such as Korean, the situation is the opposite, and new pronouns can be constructed, whereas the number of adjectives is fixed.[73]
- |
  Word classes also carry out differing functions in grammar. Prototypically, verbs are used to construct predicates, while nouns are used as arguments of predicates. In a sentence such as "Sally runs", the predicate is "runs", because it is the word that predicates a specific state about its argument "Sally". Some verbs such as "curse" can take two arguments, e.g. "Sally cursed John". A predicate that can only take a single argument is called intransitive, while a predicate that can take two arguments is called transitive.[74]
- |
  Many other word classes exist in different languages, such as conjunctions like "and" that serve to join two sentences, articles that introduce a noun, interjections such as "wow!", or ideophones like "splash" that mimic the sound of some event. Some languages have positionals that describe the spatial position of an event or entity. Many languages have classifiers that identify countable nouns as belonging to a particular type or having a particular shape. For instance, in Japanese, the general noun classifier for humans is nin (人), and it is used for counting humans, whatever they are called:[75]
- |
  san-nin no gakusei (三人の学生) lit. "3 human-classifier of student" — three students
- |
  For trees, it would be:
- |
  san-bon no ki (三本の木) lit. "3 classifier-for-long-objects of tree" — three trees
- |
  Morphology[edit]
- |
  In linguistics, the study of the internal structure of complex words and the processes by which words are formed is called morphology. In most languages, it is possible to construct complex words that are built of several morphemes. For instance, the English word "unexpected" can be analyzed as being composed of the three morphemes "un-", "expect" and "-ed".[76]
- |
  Morphemes can be classified according to whether they are independent morphemes, so-called roots, or whether they can only co-occur attached to other morphemes. These bound morphemes or affixes can be classified according to their position in relation to the root: prefixes precede the root, suffixes follow the root, and infixes are inserted in the middle of a root. Affixes serve to modify or elaborate the meaning of the root. Some languages change the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure of a word, for example, the English word "run", which in the past tense is "ran". This process is called ablaut. Furthermore, morphology distinguishes between the process of inflection, which modifies or elaborates on a word, and the process of derivation, which creates a new word from an existing one. In English, the verb "sing" has the inflectional forms "singing" and "sung", which are both verbs, and the derivational form "singer", which is a noun derived from the verb with the agentive suffix "-er".[77]
- |
  Languages differ widely in how much they rely on morphological processes of word formation. In some languages, for example, Chinese, there are no morphological processes, and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type of morpho-syntax is often called isolating, or analytic, because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in the degree to which morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments. For example, in Latin, the word bonus, or "good", consists of the root bon-, meaning "good", and the suffix -us, which indicates masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. These languages are called fusional languages, because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite of fusional languages are agglutinative languages which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit. An example of such a language is Turkish, where for example, the word evlerinizden, or "from your houses", consists of the morphemes, ev-ler-iniz-den with the meanings house-plural-your-from. The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called polysynthetic languages. They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example, in Persian the single word nafahmidamesh means I didn't understand it consisting of morphemes na-fahm-id-am-esh with the meanings, "negation.understand.past.I.it". As another example with more complexity, in the Yupik word tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq, which means "He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer", the word consists of the morphemes tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq with the meanings, "reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative", and except for the morpheme tuntu ("reindeer") none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.[78]
- |
  Many languages use morphology to cross-reference words within a sentence. This is sometimes called agreement. For example, in many Indo-European languages, adjectives must cross-reference the noun they modify in terms of number, case, and gender, so that the Latin adjective bonus, or "good", is inflected to agree with a noun that is masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. In many polysynthetic languages, verbs cross-reference their subjects and objects. In these types of languages, a single verb may include information that would require an entire sentence in English. For example, in the Basque phrase ikusi nauzu, or "you saw me", the past tense auxiliary verb n-au-zu (similar to English "do") agrees with both the subject (you) expressed by the n- prefix, and with the object (me) expressed by the -zu suffix. The sentence could be directly transliterated as "see you-did-me"[79]

  In addition to word classes, a sentence can be analyzed in terms of grammatical functions: "The cat" is the subject of the phrase, "on the mat" is a locative phrase, and "sat" is the core of the predicate.

- |2+

- |
  Another way in which languages convey meaning is through the order of words within a sentence. The grammatical rules for how to produce new sentences from words that are already known is called syntax. The syntactical rules of a language determine why a sentence in English such as "I love you" is meaningful, but "*love you I" is not.[note 3] Syntactical rules determine how word order and sentence structure is constrained, and how those constraints contribute to meaning.[80] For example, in English, the two sentences "the slaves were cursing the master" and "the master was cursing the slaves" mean different things, because the role of the grammatical subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the verb, and the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb. Conversely, in Latin, both Dominus servos vituperabat and Servos vituperabat dominus mean "the master was reprimanding the slaves", because servos, or "slaves", is in the accusative case, showing that they are the grammatical object of the sentence, and dominus, or "master", is in the nominative case, showing that he is the subject.[81]
- |
  Latin uses morphology to express the distinction between subject and object, whereas English uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of inverse word order in questions, which exists in many languages. This rule explains why when in English, the phrase "John is talking to Lucy" is turned into a question, it becomes "Who is John talking to?", and not "John is talking to who?". The latter example may be used as a way of placing special emphasis on "who", thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in units, called phrases, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure. Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure, connecting the phrases to each other at different levels.[82] To the right is a graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence "the cat sat on the mat". The sentence is analyzed as being constituted by a noun phrase, a verb, and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase, and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun.[83]
- |
  The reason sentences can be seen as being composed of phrases is because each phrase would be moved around as a single element if syntactic operations were carried out. For example, "the cat" is one phrase, and "on the mat" is another, because they would be treated as single units if a decision was made to emphasize the location by moving forward the prepositional phrase: "[And] on the mat, the cat sat".[83] There are many different formalist and functionalist frameworks that propose theories for describing syntactic structures, based on different assumptions about what language is and how it should be described. Each of them would analyze a sentence such as this in a different manner.[17]

  Typology and universals[edit]
- |
  Main articles: Linguistic typology and Linguistic universal
- |
  Languages can be classified in relation to their grammatical types. Languages that belong to different families nonetheless often have features in common, and these shared features tend to correlate.[84] For example, languages can be classified on the basis of their basic word order, the relative order of the verb, and its constituents in a normal indicative sentence. In English, the basic order is SVO: "The snake(S) bit(V) the man(O)", whereas for example, the corresponding sentence in the Australian language Gamilaraay would be d̪uyugu n̪ama d̪ayn yiːy (snake man bit), SOV.[85] Word order type is relevant as a typological parameter, because basic word order type corresponds with other syntactic parameters, such as the relative order of nouns and adjectives, or of the use of prepositions or postpositions. Such correlations are called implicational universals.[86] For example, most (but not all) languages that are of the SOV type have postpositions rather than prepositions, and have adjectives before nouns.[87]
- |
  All languages structure sentences into Subject, Verb, and Object, but languages differ in the way they classify the relations between actors and actions. English uses the nominative-accusative word typology: in English transitive clauses, the subjects of both intransitive sentences ("I run") and transitive sentences ("I love you") are treated in the same way, shown here by the nominative pronoun I. Some languages, called ergative, Gamilaraay among them, distinguish instead between Agents and Patients. In ergative languages, the single participant in an intransitive sentence, such as "I run", is treated the same as the patient in a transitive sentence, giving the equivalent of "me run" and "you love me". Only in transitive sentences would the equivalent of the pronoun "I" be used.[85] In this way the semantic roles can map onto the grammatical relations in different ways, grouping an intransitive subject either with Agents (accusative type) or Patients (ergative type) or even making each of the three roles differently, which is called the tripartite type.[88]
- |
  The shared features of languages which belong to the same typological class type may have arisen completely independently. Their co-occurrence might be due to universal laws governing the structure of natural languages, "language universals", or they might be the result of languages evolving convergent solutions to the recurring communicative problems that humans use language to solve.[18]

  While humans have the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an environment in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on communities of speakers in which children learn language from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to communicate and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes.[18] Due to the way in which language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to language contact. The process is similar to the process of evolution, where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a phylogenetic tree.[90]

  However, languages differ from a biological organisms in that they readily incorporate elements from other languages through the process of diffusion, as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their first language or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming endangered as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.[91]

  Usage and meaning[edit]
- |
  Main article: Pragmatics
- |
  The semantic study of meaning assumes that meaning is located in a relation between signs and meanings that are firmly established through social convention. However, semantics does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language. Rather, when studying the way in which words and signs are used, it is often the case that words have different meanings, depending on the social context of use. An important example of this is the process called deixis, which describes the way in which certain words refer to entities through their relation between a specific point in time and space when the word is uttered. Such words are, for example, the word, "I" (which designates the person speaking), "now" (which designates the moment of speaking), and "here" (which designates the time of speaking). Signs also change their meanings over time, as the conventions governing their usage gradually change. The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions changes depending on context is called pragmatics. Deixis is an important part of the way that we use language to point out entities in the world.[92] Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning. For example, in all languages, linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information, but to perform actions. Certain actions are made only through language, but nonetheless have tangible effects, e.g. the act of "naming", which creates a new name for some entity, or the act of "pronouncing someone man and wife", which creates a social contract of marriage. These types of acts are called speech acts, although they can of course also be carried out through writing or hand signing.[93]
- |
  The form of linguistic expression often does not correspond to the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner table a person asks, "Can you reach the salt?", that is, in fact, not a question about the length of the arms of the one being addressed, but a request to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken; these kinds of effects of meaning are called conversational implicatures. These social rules for which ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation to their context vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring communicative competence in a language.[94]

  Language acquisition[edit]

  Main articles: Language acquisition, Second-language acquisition, Second language and Language education

  All healthy, normally developing human beings learn to use language. Children acquire the language or languages used around them: whichever languages they receive sufficient exposure to during childhood. The development is essentially the same for children acquiring sign or oral languages.[95] This learning process is referred to as first-language acquisition, since unlike many other kinds of learning, it requires no direct teaching or specialized study. In The Descent of Man, naturalist Charles Darwin called this process "an instinctive tendency to acquire an art".[10]

  First language acquisition proceeds in a fairly regular sequence, though there is a wide degree of variation in the timing of particular stages among normally developing infants. From birth, newborns respond more readily to human speech than to other sounds. Around one month of age, babies appear to be able to distinguish between different speech sounds. Around six months of age, a child will begin babbling, producing the speech sounds or handshapes of the languages used around them. Words appear around the age of 12 to 18 months; the average vocabulary of an eighteen-month-old child is around 50 words. A child's first utterances are holophrases (literally "whole-sentences"), utterances that use just one word to communicate some idea. Several months after a child begins producing words, she or he will produce two-word utterances, and within a few more months will begin to produce telegraphic speech, or short sentences that are less grammatically complex than adult speech, but that do show regular syntactic structure. From roughly the age of three to five years, a child's ability to speak or sign is refined to the point that it resembles adult language.[96][97] Studies published in 2013 have indicated that unborn fetuses are capable of language acquisition to some degree.[98][99]
- |
  Acquisition of second and additional languages can come at any age, through exposure in daily life or courses. Children learning a second language are more likely to achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.[100]

  Languages, understood as the particular set of speech norms of a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that speaks them. Languages differ not only in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, but also through having different "cultures of speaking." Humans use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group as well as difference from others. Even among speakers of one language, several different ways of using the language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger culture. Linguists and anthropologists, particularly sociolinguists, ethnolinguists, and linguistic anthropologists have specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between speech communities.[101]
- |
  Linguists use the term "varieties" to refer to the different ways of speaking a language. This term includes geographically or socioculturally defined dialects as well as the jargons or styles of subcultures. Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.[102]
- |
  Because norms for language use are shared by members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status as a second language speaker. These kinds of differences are not part of the linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.[103]
- |
  However, many languages also have grammatical conventions that signal the social position of the speaker in relation to others through the use of registers that are related to social hierarchies or divisions. In many languages, there are stylistic or even grammatical differences between the ways men and women speak, between age groups, or between social classes, just as some languages employ different words depending on who is listening. For example, in the Australian language Dyirbal, a married man must use a special set of words to refer to everyday items when speaking in the presence of his mother-in-law.[104] Some cultures, for example, have elaborate systems of "social deixis", or systems of signalling social distance through linguistic means.[105] In English, social deixis is shown mostly through distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname, and in titles such as "Mrs.", "boy", "Doctor", or "Your Honor", but in other languages, such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language. For instance, in languages of east Asia such as Thai, Burmese, and Javanese, different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.[105]

  Throughout history a number of different ways of representing language in graphic media have been invented. These are called writing systems.
- |
  The use of writing has made language even more useful to humans. It makes it possible to store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and formal education.[106]
- |
  The invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the Bronze Age in the late 4th millennium BC. The Sumerian archaic cuneiform script and the Egyptian hieroglyphs are generally considered to be the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with the earliest coherent texts from about 2600 BC. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of cultural diffusion. A similar debate exists for the Chinese script, which developed around 1200 BC. The pre-Columbian Mesoamerican writing systems (including among others Olmec and Maya scripts) are generally believed to have had independent origins.[68]

  All languages change as speakers adopt or invent new ways of speaking and pass them on to other members of their speech community. Language change happens at all levels from the phonological level to the levels of vocabulary, morphology, syntax, and discourse. Even though language change is often initially evaluated negatively by speakers of the language who often consider changes to be "decay" or a sign of slipping norms of language usage, it is natural and inevitable.[107]
- |
  Changes may affect specific sounds or the entire phonological system. Sound change can consist of the replacement of one speech sound or phonetic feature by another, the complete loss of the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there previously was none. Sound changes can be conditioned in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be regular, which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be sporadic, affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a chain shift in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the Germanic languages when the sound change known as Grimm's law affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant *bʰ became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous *b in turn became /p/, and the previous *p became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why Italic languages such as Latin have p in words like pater and pisces, whereas Germanic languages, like English, have father and fish.[108]
- |
  Another example is the Great Vowel Shift in English, which is the reason that the spelling of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.[109]
- |
  Change also happens in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as idioms or particular constructions become grammaticalized. This frequently happens when words or morphemes erode and the grammatical system is unconsciously rearranged to compensate for the lost element. For example, in some varieties of Caribbean Spanish the final /s/ has eroded away. Since Standard Spanish uses final /s/ in the morpheme marking the second person subject "you" in verbs, the Caribbean varieties now have to express the second person using the pronoun tú. This means that the sentence "what's your name" is ¿como te llamas? ['komo te 'jamas] in Standard Spanish, but ['komo 'tu te 'jama] in Caribbean Spanish. The simple sound change has affected both morphology and syntax.[110] Another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual petrification of idioms into new grammatical forms, for example, the way the English "going to" construction lost its aspect of movement and in some varieties of English has almost become a full-fledged future tense (e.g. I'm gonna).
- |
  Language change may be motivated by "language internal" factors, such as changes in pronunciation motivated by certain sounds being difficult to distinguish aurally or to produce, or through patterns of change that cause some rare types of constructions to drift towards more common types.[111] Other causes of language change are social, such as when certain pronunciations become emblematic of membership in certain groups, such as social classes, or with ideologies, and therefore are adopted by those who wish to identify with those groups or ideas. In this way, issues of identity and politics can have profound effects on language structure.[112]

  Language contact[edit]
- |
  Main article: language contact
- |
  One important source of language change is contact and resulting diffusion of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs when speakers of two or more languages or varieties interact on a regular basis.[113]Multilingualism is likely to have been the norm throughout human history and most people in the modern world are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the ethno-national state, monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the ideology that made one people, one state, and one language the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.[114]
- |
  When speakers of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence each other. Through sustained language contact over long periods, linguistic traits diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different families may converge to become more similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact, this may lead to the formation of language areas in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A number of such language areas have been documented, among them, the Balkan language area, the Mesoamerican language area, and the Ethiopian language area. Also, larger areas such as South Asia, Europe, and Southeast Asia have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of specific areal features.[115][116]
- |
  Language contact may also lead to a variety of other linguistic phenomena, including language convergence, borrowing, and relexification (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In situations of extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation of new mixed languages that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called pidgins occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case, they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a creole language. An example of such mixed languages is Tok Pisin, the official language of Papua New-Guinea, which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and Austronesian languages; others are Kreyòl ayisyen, the French-based creole language spoken in Haiti, and Michif, a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language Cree and French.[117]

  SIL Ethnologue defines a "living language" as "one that has at least one speaker for whom it is their first language". The exact number of known living languages varies from 6,000 to 7,000, depending on the precision of one's definition of "language", and in particular, on how one defines the distinction between languages and dialects. As of 2015, Ethnologue cataloged 7,102 living human languages.[119] The Ethnologue establishes linguistic groups based on studies of mutual intelligibility, and therefore often includes more categories than more conservative classifications. For example, the Danish language that most scholars consider a single language with several dialects is classified as two distinct languages (Danish and Jutish) by the Ethnologue.[118]
- |
  According to the Ethnologue, 389 languages (nearly 6%) have more than a million speakers. These languages together account for 94% of the world's population, whereas 94% of the world's languages account for the remaining 6% of the global population. To the right is a table of the world's 10 most spoken languages with population estimates from the Ethnologue (2009 figures).[118]

  There is no clear distinction between a language and a dialect, notwithstanding a famous aphorism attributed to linguist Max Weinreich that "a language is a dialect with an army and navy".[120] For example, national boundaries frequently override linguistic difference in determining whether two linguistic varieties are languages or dialects. Cantonese and Mandarin are, for example, often classified as "dialects" of Chinese, even though they are more different from each other than Swedish is from Norwegian. Before the Yugoslav civil war, Serbo-Croatian was considered a single language with two dialects, but now Croatian and Serbian are considered different languages and employ different writing systems. In other words, the distinction may hinge on political considerations as much as on cultural differences, distinctive writing systems, or degree of mutual intelligibility.[121]

  The world's languages can be grouped into language families consisting of languages that can be shown to have common ancestry. Linguists recognize many hundreds of language families, although some of them can possibly be grouped into larger units as more evidence becomes available and in-depth studies are carried out. At present, there are also dozens of language isolates: languages that cannot be shown to be related to any other languages in the world. Among them are Basque, spoken in Europe, Zuni of New Mexico, Purépecha of Mexico, Ainu of Japan, Burushaski of Pakistan, and many others.[122]
- |
  The language family of the world that has the most speakers is the Indo-European languages, spoken by 46% of the world's population.[123] This family includes major world languages like English, Spanish, Russian, and Hindustani (Hindi/Urdu). The Indo-European family achieved prevalence first during the Eurasian Migration Period (c. 400–800 AD)[citation needed], and subsequently through the European colonial expansion, which brought the Indo-European languages to a politically and often numerically dominant position in the Americas and much of Africa. The Sino-Tibetan languages are spoken by 20%[123] of the world's population and include many of the languages of East Asia, including Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, and hundreds of smaller languages.[124]
- |
  Africa is home to a large number of language families, the largest of which is the Niger-Congo language family, which includes such languages as Swahili, Shona, and Yoruba. Speakers of the Niger-Congo languages account for 6.9% of the world's population.[123] A similar number of people speak the Afroasiatic languages, which include the populous Semitic languages such as Arabic, Hebrew language, and the languages of the Sahara region, such as the Berber languages and Hausa.[124]
- |
  The Austronesian languages are spoken by 5.5% of the world's population and stretch from Madagascar to maritime Southeast Asia all the way to Oceania.[123] It includes such languages as Malagasy, Māori, Samoan, and many of the indigenous languages of Indonesia and Taiwan. The Austronesian languages are considered to have originated in Taiwan around 3000 BC and spread through the Oceanic region through island-hopping, based on an advanced nautical technology. Other populous language families are the Dravidian languages of South Asia (among them Kannada Tamil and Telugu), the Turkic languages of Central Asia (such as Turkish), the Austroasiatic (among them Khmer), and Tai–Kadai languages of Southeast Asia (including Thai).[124]
- |
  The areas of the world in which there is the greatest linguistic diversity, such as the Americas, Papua New Guinea, West Africa, and South-Asia, contain hundreds of small language families. These areas together account for the majority of the world's languages, though not the majority of speakers. In the Americas, some of the largest language families include the Quechumaran, Arawak, and Tupi-Guarani families of South America, the Uto-Aztecan, Oto-Manguean, and Mayan of Mesoamerica, and the Na-Dene and Algonquian language families of North America. In Australia, most indigenous languages belong to the Pama-Nyungan family, whereas Papua-New Guinea is home to a large number of small families and isolates, as well as a number of Austronesian languages.[122]

  Language endangerment[edit]

  Language endangerment occurs when a language is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers die out or shift to speaking another language. Language loss occurs when the language has no more native speakers, and becomes a dead language. If eventually no one speaks the language at all, it becomes an extinct language. While languages have always gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes of globalization and neo-colonialism, where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.[125]
- |
  The more commonly spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The total number of languages in the world is not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. The consensus is that there are between 6,000[126] and 7,000 languages currently spoken (as of 2010), and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100.[125] The top 20 languages, those spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.[125]
- |
  The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) operates with five levels of language endangerment: "safe", "vulnerable" (not spoken by children outside the home), "definitely endangered" (not spoken by children), "severely endangered" (only spoken by the oldest generations), and "critically endangered" (spoken by few members of the oldest generation, often semi-speakers). Notwithstanding claims that the world would be better off if most adopted a single common lingua franca, such as English or Esperanto, there is a consensus that the loss of languages harms the cultural diversity of the world. It is a common belief, going back to the biblical narrative of the tower of Babel, that linguistic diversity causes political conflict,[27] but this is contradicted by the fact that many of the world's major episodes of violence have taken place in situations with low linguistic diversity, such as the Yugoslav and American Civil War, or the genocide of Rwanda, whereas many of the most stable political units have been highly multilingual.[127]
- |
  Many projects aim to prevent or slow this loss by revitalizing endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries have enacted specific legislation to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous speech communities. A minority of linguists have argued that language loss is a natural process that should not be counteracted, and that documenting endangered languages for posterity is sufficient.[128]

  ^ "Functional grammar analyzes grammatical structure, as do formal and structural grammar; but it also analyzes the entire communicative situation: the purpose of the speech event, its participants, its discourse context. Functionalists maintain that the communicative situation motivates, constrains, explains, or otherwise determines grammatical structure, and that a structural or formal approaches not merely limited to an artificially restricted data base, but is inadequate even as a structural account. Functional grammar, then, differs from formal and structural grammar in that it purports not to model but to explain; and the explanation is grounded in the communicative situation"; Nichols (1984)

- '} );Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication,
  particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example
  of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics.Questions
  concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience,
  have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau
  have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held
  that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers
  such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major
  figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure, Noam Chomsky and William C.
  Stokoe.Estimates of the number of languages in the world vary between 5,000 and
  7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on a partly arbitrary distinction between
  languages and dialects. Natural languages are spoken or signed, but any language
  can be encoded into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli –
  for example, in graphic writing, braille, or whistling. This is because human language
  is modality-independent. Depending on philosophical perspectives regarding the definition
  of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, "language" may refer to
  the cognitive ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe
  the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can
  be produced from those rules. All languages rely on the process of semiosis to relate
  signs to particular meanings. Oral and sign languages contain a phonological system
  that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or morphemes,
  and a syntactic system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form
  phrases and utterances.Human language has the properties of productivity, recursivity,
  and displacement, and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex
  structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of animal
  communication. Language is thought to have originated when early hominins started
  gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to
  form a theory of other minds and a shared intentionality.[1][2] This development
  is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many
  linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative
  and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the human
  brain, but especially in Broca''s and Wernicke''s areas. Humans acquire language
  through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently
  when they are approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched
  in human culture. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language
  also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group identity, social
  stratification, as well as social grooming and entertainment.Languages evolve and
  diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by
  comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must
  have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages
  that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family. The Indo-European
  family is the most widely spoken and includes English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian,
  and Hindi; the Sino-Tibetan family, which includes Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese,
  and Standard Tibetan; the Afro-Asiatic family, which includes Arabic, Amharic, Somali,
  and Hebrew; the Bantu languages, which include Swahili, Zulu, Shona, and hundreds
  of other languages spoken throughout Africa; and the Malayo-Polynesian languages,
  which include Indonesian, Malay, Tagalog, Malagasy, and hundreds of other languages
  spoken throughout the Pacific. The languages of the Dravidian family that are spoken
  mostly in Southern India include Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. Academic
  consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of
  the 21st century will probably have become extinct by the year 2100.The English
  word language derives ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *dn̥ǵʰwéh₂s "tongue, speech,
  language" through Latin lingua, "language; tongue", and Old French language.[3]
  The word is sometimes used to refer to codes, ciphers, and other kinds of artificially
  constructed communication systems such as formally defined computer languages used
  for computer programming. Unlike conventional human languages, a formal language
  in this sense is a system of signs for encoding and decoding information. This article
  specifically concerns the properties of natural human language as it is studied
  in the discipline of linguistics.As an object of linguistic study, "language" has
  two primary meanings: an abstract concept, and a specific linguistic system, e.g.
  "French". The Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, who defined the modern discipline
  of linguistics, first explicitly formulated the distinction using the French word
  langage for language as a concept, langue as a specific instance of a language system,
  and parole for the concrete usage of speech in a particular language.[4]When speaking
  of language as a general concept, definitions can be used which stress different
  aspects of the phenomenon.[5] These definitions also entail different approaches
  and understandings of language, and they inform different and often incompatible
  schools of linguistic theory.[6] Debates about the nature and origin of language
  go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as Gorgias and Plato debated
  the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could
  represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication
  and truth were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible
  because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and
  prior to, language.[7]During the Enlightenment and its debates about human origins,
  it became fashionable to speculate about the origin of language. Thinkers such as
  Rousseau and Herder argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression
  of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical
  expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and Descartes
  held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder
  about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world – asking whether
  language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates
  concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This
  led to the question of whether philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic
  problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the
  creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially
  the study of language, is associated with what has been called the linguistic turn
  and philosophers such as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy. These debates
  about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness
  remain active today.[8]One definition sees language primarily as the mental faculty
  that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and to
  produce and understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of
  language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity
  for language as a unique development of the human brain. Proponents of the view
  that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported
  by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where
  language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages
  may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together
  without a common language; for example, creole languages and spontaneously developed
  sign languages such as Nicaraguan Sign Language. This view, which can be traced
  back to the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely
  innate, for example, in Chomsky''s theory of Universal Grammar, or American philosopher
  Jerry Fodor''s extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied
  in studies of language within a cognitive science framework and in neurolinguistics.[9][10]Another
  definition sees language as a formal system of signs governed by grammatical rules
  of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages
  can be described as closed structural systems consisting of rules that relate particular
  signs to particular meanings.[11] This structuralist view of language was first
  introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure,[12] and his structuralism remains foundational
  for many approaches to language.[13]Some proponents of Saussure''s view of language
  have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying
  its basic elements and then by presenting a formal account of the rules according
  to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent
  of such a theory is Noam Chomsky, the originator of the generative theory of grammar,
  who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated
  using transformational grammars.[14] Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate
  feature of the human mind and to constitute the rudiments of what language is.[15]
  By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide
  formal definitions of language are commonly used in formal logic, in formal theories
  of grammar, and in applied computational linguistics.[16][17] In the philosophy
  of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations
  between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as Alfred Tarski,
  Bertrand Russell, and other formal logicians.Yet another definition sees language
  as a system of communication that enables humans to exchange verbal or symbolic
  utterances. This definition stresses the social functions of language and the fact
  that humans use it to express themselves and to manipulate objects in their environment.
  Functional theories of grammar explain grammatical structures by their communicative
  functions, and understand the grammatical structures of language to be the result
  of an adaptive process by which grammar was "tailored" to serve the communicative
  needs of its users.[18][19]This view of language is associated with the study of
  language in pragmatic, cognitive, and interactive frameworks, as well as in sociolinguistics
  and linguistic anthropology. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic
  phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are
  employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of linguistic
  typology, or the classification of languages according to structural features, as
  it can be shown that processes of grammaticalization tend to follow trajectories
  that are partly dependent on typology.[17] In the philosophy of language, the view
  of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with
  Wittgenstein''s later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as J. L.
  Austin, Paul Grice, John Searle, and W. O. Quine.[20]Human language is unique in
  comparison to other forms of communication, such as those used by non-human animals.
  Communication systems used by other animals such as bees or apes are closed systems
  that consist of a finite, usually very limited, number of possible ideas that can
  be expressed.[21]In contrast, human language is open-ended and productive, meaning
  that it allows humans to produce a vast range of utterances from a finite set of
  elements, and to create new words and sentences. This is possible because human
  language is based on a dual code, in which a finite number of elements which are
  meaningless in themselves (e.g. sounds, letters or gestures) can be combined to
  form a theoretically infinite number of larger units of meaning (words and sentences).[22]
  Furthermore, the symbols and grammatical rules of any particular language are largely
  arbitrary, so that the system can only be acquired through social interaction.[23]
  The known systems of communication used by animals, on the other hand, can only
  express a finite number of utterances that are mostly genetically determined.[24]Several
  species of animals have proved to be able to acquire forms of communication through
  social learning: for instance a bonobo named Kanzi learned to express itself using
  a set of symbolic lexigrams. Similarly, many species of birds and whales learn their
  songs by imitating other members of their species. However, while some animals may
  acquire large numbers of words and symbols,[note 1] none have been able to learn
  as many different signs as are generally known by an average 4 year old human, nor
  have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language.[25]Human
  languages also differ from animal communication systems in that they employ grammatical
  and semantic categories, such as noun and verb, present and past, which may be used
  to express exceedingly complex meanings.[25] Human language is also unique in having
  the property of recursivity: for example, a noun phrase can contain another noun
  phrase (as in "[[the chimpanzee]''s lips]") or a clause can contain another clause
  (as in "[I see [the dog is running]]").[2] Human language is also the only known
  natural communication system whose adaptability may be referred to as modality independent.
  This means that it can be used not only for communication through one channel or
  medium, but through several. For example, spoken language uses the auditive modality,
  whereas sign languages and writing use the visual modality, and braille writing
  uses the tactile modality.[26]Human language is also unique in being able to refer
  to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events that
  took place in the past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events
  that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called displacement,
  and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication
  of bees that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight),
  the degree to which it is used in human language is also considered unique.[22]Theories
  about the origin of language differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what
  language is. Some theories are based on the idea that language is so complex that
  one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that
  it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors.
  These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is
  that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything
  found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the
  transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based.
  Similarly, theories based on Chomsky''s generative view of language see language
  mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist
  theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.[28]The
  only prominent proponent of a discontinuity-based theory of human language origins
  is linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky.[28] Chomsky proposes that "some random
  mutation took place, maybe after some strange cosmic ray shower, and it reorganized
  the brain, implanting a language organ in an otherwise primate brain."[29] Though
  cautioning against taking this story too literally, Chomsky insists that "it may
  be closer to reality than many other fairy tales that are told about evolutionary
  processes, including language."[29]Continuity-based theories are held by a majority
  of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Those who see
  language as being mostly innate, for example psychologist Steven Pinker, hold the
  precedents to be animal cognition,[10] whereas those who see language as a socially
  learned tool of communication, such as psychologist Michael Tomasello, see it as
  having developed from animal communication in primates: either gestural or vocal
  communication to assist in cooperation.[24] Other continuity-based models see language
  as having developed from music, a view already espoused by Rousseau, Herder, Humboldt,
  and Charles Darwin. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist Steven Mithen.[30]Stephen
  Anderson states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000
  years[31] and that:Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally
  find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only once, and that all
  modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can
  no longer be recovered ... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction.[32]Because
  language emerged in the early prehistory of man, its early development has left
  no historical traces, and it is believed that no comparable processes can be observed
  today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example,
  primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language
  must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical
  adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among
  the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are the size of
  the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a larynx capable of advanced sound
  production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.[33]It is mostly
  undisputed that pre-human australopithecines did not have communication systems
  significantly different from those found in great apes in general, but scholarly
  opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of the genus Homo some
  2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like
  systems (proto-language) as early as Homo habilis (2.3 million years ago) while
  others place the development of primitive symbolic communication only with Homo
  erectus (1.8 million years ago) or Homo heidelbergensis (0.6 million years ago),
  and the development of language proper with Anatomically Modern Homo sapiens with
  the Upper Paleolithic revolution less than 100,000 years ago.[34][35]The study of
  language, linguistics, has been developing into a science since the first grammatical
  descriptions of particular languages in India more than 2000 years ago. Modern linguistics
  is a science that concerns itself with all aspects of language, examining it from
  all of the theoretical viewpoints described above.[36]The academic study of language
  is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical
  angles, all of which inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, descriptive
  linguistics examines the grammar of single languages, theoretical linguistics develops
  theories on how best to conceptualize and define the nature of language based on
  data from the various extant human languages, sociolinguistics studies how languages
  are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions
  of language and grammatical description, neurolinguistics studies how language is
  processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, computational
  linguistics builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational
  models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic
  hypotheses, and historical linguistics relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions
  of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language
  families by using the comparative method.[37]The formal study of language is often
  considered to have started in India with Pāṇini, the 5th century BC grammarian who
  formulated 3,959 rules of Sanskrit morphology. However, Sumerian scribes already
  studied the differences between Sumerian and Akkadian grammar around 1900 BC. Subsequent
  grammatical traditions developed in all of the ancient cultures that adopted writing.[38]In
  the 17th century AD, the French Port-Royal Grammarians developed the idea that the
  grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics of thought,
  and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of
  the comparative method by British philologist and expert on ancient India William
  Jones sparked the rise of comparative linguistics.[39] The scientific study of language
  was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by Wilhelm von Humboldt.
  Early in the 20th century, Ferdinand de Saussure introduced the idea of language
  as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between
  them.[12]By introducing a distinction between diachronic and synchronic analyses
  of language, he laid the foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure
  also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental
  in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between syntagm
  and paradigm, and the Langue-parole distinction, distinguishing language as an abstract
  system (langue), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (parole).[40]In
  the 1960s, Noam Chomsky formulated the generative theory of language. According
  to this theory, the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules that
  is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages.
  This set of rules is called Universal Grammar; for Chomsky, describing it is the
  primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the
  grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as
  they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable
  linguistic variability is generated.[41]In opposition to the formal theories of
  the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language
  is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference
  to their functions. Formal theories of grammar seek to define the different elements
  of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal
  rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed
  by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out.[17][note
  2] The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of the concepts
  (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language)
  which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how
  the mind creates meaning through language.[42]Speaking is the default modality for
  language in all cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated
  capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus,
  the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus
  required for acquiring and producing language.[43] The study of the genetic bases
  for human language is at an early stage: the only gene that has definitely been
  implicated in language production is FOXP2, which may cause a kind of congenital
  language disorder if affected by mutations.[44]The brain is the coordinating center
  of all linguistic activity; it controls both the production of linguistic cognition
  and of meaning and the mechanics of speech production. Nonetheless, our knowledge
  of the neurological bases for language is quite limited, though it has advanced
  considerably with the use of modern imaging techniques. The discipline of linguistics
  dedicated to studying the neurological aspects of language is called neurolinguistics.[45]Early
  work in neurolinguistics involved the study of language in people with brain lesions,
  to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists
  in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated
  in language processing. The first area is Wernicke''s area, which is located in
  the posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere.
  People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition
  in which there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains
  a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second
  area is Broca''s area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant
  hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning
  that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out.[46] They are
  typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently.
  Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency,
  articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex
  grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also
  exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to
  determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect
  the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive
  aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer
  with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have
  difficulties comprehending others'' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific
  to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.[47][48]With
  technological advances in the late 20th century, neurolinguists have also incorporated
  non-invasive techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
  electrophysiology to study language processing in individuals without impairments.[45]Spoken
  language relies on human physical ability to produce sound, which is a longitudinal
  wave propagated through the air at a frequency capable of vibrating the ear drum.
  This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs
  consist of the lungs, the voice box (larynx), and the upper vocal tract – the throat,
  the mouth, and the nose. By controlling the different parts of the speech apparatus,
  the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.[49]The sound
  of speech can be analyzed into a combination of segmental and suprasegmental elements.
  The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are
  usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman
  script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment
  and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore
  are distinguished by their distinct sounds which are a result of their different
  articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena
  encompass such elements as stress, phonation type, voice timbre, and prosody or
  intonation, all of which may have effects across multiple segments.[50]Consonants
  and vowel segments combine to form syllables, which in turn combine to form utterances;
  these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations. Acoustically,
  these different segments are characterized by different formant structures, that
  are visible in a spectrogram of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram
  of the formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude peaks
  in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.[50][51]Vowels are those sounds that
  have no audible friction caused by the narrowing or obstruction of some part of
  the upper vocal tract. They vary in quality according to the degree of lip aperture
  and the placement of the tongue within the oral cavity.[50] Vowels are called close
  when the lips are relatively closed, as in the pronunciation of the vowel [i] (English
  "ee"), or open when the lips are relatively open, as in the vowel [a] (English "ah").
  If the tongue is located towards the back of the mouth, the quality changes, creating
  vowels such as [u] (English "oo"). The quality also changes depending on whether
  the lips are rounded as opposed to unrounded, creating distinctions such as that
  between [i] (unrounded front vowel such as English "ee") and [y] (rounded front
  vowel such as German "ü").[52]Consonants are those sounds that have audible friction
  or closure at some point within the upper vocal tract. Consonant sounds vary by
  place of articulation, i.e. the place in the vocal tract where the airflow is obstructed,
  commonly at the lips, teeth, alveolar ridge, palate, velum, uvula, or glottis. Each
  place of articulation produces a different set of consonant sounds, which are further
  distinguished by manner of articulation, or the kind of friction, whether full closure,
  in which case the consonant is called occlusive or stop, or different degrees of
  aperture creating fricatives and approximants. Consonants can also be either voiced
  or unvoiced, depending on whether the vocal cords are set in vibration by airflow
  during the production of the sound. Voicing is what separates English [s] in bus
  (unvoiced sibilant) from [z] in buzz (voiced sibilant).[53]Some speech sounds, both
  vowels and consonants, involve release of air flow through the nasal cavity, and
  these are called nasals or nasalized sounds. Other sounds are defined by the way
  the tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called laterals, because
  the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds (called rhotics)
  that are characterized by how the tongue is positioned relative to the air stream.[51]By
  using these speech organs, humans can produce hundreds of distinct sounds: some
  appear very often in the world''s languages, whereas others are much more common
  in certain language families, language areas, or even specific to a single language.[54]When
  described as a system of symbolic communication, language is traditionally seen
  as consisting of three parts: signs, meanings, and a code connecting signs with
  their meanings. The study of the process of semiosis, how signs and meanings are
  combined, used, and interpreted is called semiotics. Signs can be composed of sounds,
  gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed,
  or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases.
  When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through
  a channel to a receiver who decodes it.[55]Some of the properties that define human
  language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness of the
  linguistic sign, meaning that there is no predictable connection between a linguistic
  sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, meaning that linguistic
  structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen
  as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases; the discreteness
  of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which linguistic signs
  are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that can be distinguished
  from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the
  linguistic system, meaning that the finite number of linguistic elements can be
  combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.[55]The rules by which
  signs can be combined to form words and phrases are called syntax or grammar. The
  meaning that is connected to individual signs, morphemes, words, phrases, and texts
  is called semantics.[56] The division of language into separate but connected systems
  of sign and meaning goes back to the first linguistic studies of de Saussure and
  is now used in almost all branches of linguistics.[57]Languages express meaning
  by relating a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must be something
  that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related
  to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning
  for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be
  considered arbitrary, in the sense that the convention is established socially and
  historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign
  form and its meaning.Thus, languages must have a vocabulary of signs related to
  specific meaning. The English sign "dog" denotes, for example, a member of the species
  Canis familiaris. In a language, the array of arbitrary signs connected to specific
  meanings is called the lexicon, and a single sign connected to a meaning is called
  a lexeme. Not all meanings in a language are represented by single words. Often,
  semantic concepts are embedded in the morphology or syntax of the language in the
  form of grammatical categories.[58]All languages contain the semantic structure
  of predication: a structure that predicates a property, state, or action. Traditionally,
  semantics has been understood to be the study of how speakers and interpreters assign
  truth values to statements, so that meaning is understood to be the process by which
  a predicate can be said to be true or false about an entity, e.g. "[x [is y]]" or
  "[x [does y]]". Recently, this model of semantics has been complemented with more
  dynamic models of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the context in
  which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning. Such models of meaning
  are explored in the field of pragmatics.[58]Depending on modality, language structure
  can be based on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic
  or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to
  construct meaning are studied in phonology.[59] The study of how humans produce
  and perceive vocal sounds is called phonetics.[60] In spoken language, meaning is
  produced when sounds become part of a system in which some sounds can contribute
  to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, only a limited number
  of the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute
  to constructing meaning.[54]Sounds as part of a linguistic system are called phonemes.[61]
  Phonemes are abstract units of sound, defined as the smallest units in a language
  that can serve to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally different
  words, a so-called minimal pair. In English, for example, the words bat [bæt] and
  pat [pʰæt] form a minimal pair, in which the distinction between /b/ and /p/ differentiates
  the two words, which have different meanings. However, each language contrasts sounds
  in different ways. For example, in a language that does not distinguish between
  voiced and unvoiced consonants, the sounds [p] and [b] (if they both occur) could
  be considered a single phoneme, and consequently, the two pronunciations would have
  the same meaning. Similarly, the English language does not distinguish phonemically
  between aspirated and non-aspirated pronunciations of consonants, as many other
  languages do: the unaspirated /p/ in spin [spɪn] and the aspirated /p/ in pin [pʰɪn]
  are considered to be merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme (such
  variants of a single phoneme are called allophones), whereas in Mandarin Chinese,
  the same difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words [pʰá] ''crouch''
  and [pá] ''eight'' (the accent above the á means that the vowel is pronounced with
  a high tone).[62]All spoken languages have phonemes of at least two different categories,
  vowels and consonants, that can be combined to form syllables.[50] As well as segments
  such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey
  meaning. Many languages, for example, use stress, pitch, duration, and tone to distinguish
  meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments,
  they are called suprasegmental.[63] Some languages have only a few phonemes, for
  example, Rotokas and Pirahã language with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas
  languages like Taa may have as many as 141 phonemes.[62] In sign languages, the
  equivalent to phonemes (formerly called cheremes) are defined by the basic elements
  of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond
  to manners of articulation in spoken language.[64][65][66]Writing systems represent
  language using visual symbols, which may or may not correspond to the sounds of
  spoken language. The Latin alphabet (and those on which it is based or that have
  been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds,
  so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant
  or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the Inuktitut
  syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In logographic scripts, each sign
  represents an entire word,[67] and will generally bear no relation to the sound
  of that word in spoken language.Because all languages have a very large number of
  words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents
  the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according
  to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system
  is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the
  horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the Arabic
  script), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension
  (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating
  lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction
  and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.[68]In order
  to represent the sounds of the world''s languages in writing, linguists have developed
  the International Phonetic Alphabet, designed to represent all of the discrete sounds
  that are known to contribute to meaning in human languages.[69]Grammar is the study
  of how meaningful elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into
  utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved
  around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they are bound
  to other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful
  elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the
  internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure
  of phrases and sentences are called syntax.[70]Grammar can be described as a system
  of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different
  aspects of meaning.[71] Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through
  the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common
  as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the
  grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing
  between their relations to a predicate, the encoding of temporal and spatial relations
  on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction
  between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.[72]Languages
  organize their parts of speech into classes according to their functions and positions
  relative to other parts. All languages, for instance, make a basic distinction between
  a group of words that prototypically denotes things and concepts and a group of
  words that prototypically denotes actions and events. The first group, which includes
  English words such as "dog" and "song", are usually called nouns. The second, which
  includes "run" and "sing", are called verbs. Another common category is the adjective:
  words that describe properties or qualities of nouns, such as "red" or "big". Word
  classes can be "open" if new words can continuously be added to the class, or relatively
  "closed" if there is a fixed number of words in a class. In English, the class of
  pronouns is closed, whereas the class of adjectives is open, since an infinite number
  of adjectives can be constructed from verbs (e.g. "saddened") or nouns (e.g. with
  the -like suffix, as in "noun-like"). In other languages such as Korean, the situation
  is the opposite, and new pronouns can be constructed, whereas the number of adjectives
  is fixed.[73]Word classes also carry out differing functions in grammar. Prototypically,
  verbs are used to construct predicates, while nouns are used as arguments of predicates.
  In a sentence such as "Sally runs", the predicate is "runs", because it is the word
  that predicates a specific state about its argument "Sally". Some verbs such as
  "curse" can take two arguments, e.g. "Sally cursed John". A predicate that can only
  take a single argument is called intransitive, while a predicate that can take two
  arguments is called transitive.[74]Many other word classes exist in different languages,
  such as conjunctions like "and" that serve to join two sentences, articles that
  introduce a noun, interjections such as "wow!", or ideophones like "splash" that
  mimic the sound of some event. Some languages have positionals that describe the
  spatial position of an event or entity. Many languages have classifiers that identify
  countable nouns as belonging to a particular type or having a particular shape.
  For instance, in Japanese, the general noun classifier for humans is nin (人), and
  it is used for counting humans, whatever they are called:[75]For trees, it would
  be:In linguistics, the study of the internal structure of complex words and the
  processes by which words are formed is called morphology. In most languages, it
  is possible to construct complex words that are built of several morphemes. For
  instance, the English word "unexpected" can be analyzed as being composed of the
  three morphemes "un-", "expect" and "-ed".[76]Morphemes can be classified according
  to whether they are independent morphemes, so-called roots, or whether they can
  only co-occur attached to other morphemes. These bound morphemes or affixes can
  be classified according to their position in relation to the root: prefixes precede
  the root, suffixes follow the root, and infixes are inserted in the middle of a
  root. Affixes serve to modify or elaborate the meaning of the root. Some languages
  change the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure of a word, for
  example, the English word "run", which in the past tense is "ran". This process
  is called ablaut. Furthermore, morphology distinguishes between the process of inflection,
  which modifies or elaborates on a word, and the process of derivation, which creates
  a new word from an existing one. In English, the verb "sing" has the inflectional
  forms "singing" and "sung", which are both verbs, and the derivational form "singer",
  which is a noun derived from the verb with the agentive suffix "-er".[77]Languages
  differ widely in how much they rely on morphological processes of word formation.
  In some languages, for example, Chinese, there are no morphological processes, and
  all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single
  words. This type of morpho-syntax is often called isolating, or analytic, because
  there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect
  of meaning. Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they
  vary in the degree to which morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably
  in most Indo-European languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings
  that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments. For example, in Latin, the word bonus,
  or "good", consists of the root bon-, meaning "good", and the suffix -us, which
  indicates masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. These languages
  are called fusional languages, because several meanings may be fused into a single
  morpheme. The opposite of fusional languages are agglutinative languages which construct
  words by stringing morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete
  semantic unit. An example of such a language is Turkish, where for example, the
  word evlerinizden, or "from your houses", consists of the morphemes, ev-ler-iniz-den
  with the meanings house-plural-your-from. The languages that rely on morphology
  to the greatest extent are traditionally called polysynthetic languages. They may
  express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example,
  in Persian the single word nafahmidamesh means I didn''t understand it consisting
  of morphemes na-fahm-id-am-esh with the meanings, "negation.understand.past.I.it".
  As another example with more complexity, in the Yupik word tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq,
  which means "He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer", the
  word consists of the morphemes tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq with the meanings,
  "reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative", and
  except for the morpheme tuntu ("reindeer") none of the other morphemes can appear
  in isolation.[78]Many languages use morphology to cross-reference words within a
  sentence. This is sometimes called agreement. For example, in many Indo-European
  languages, adjectives must cross-reference the noun they modify in terms of number,
  case, and gender, so that the Latin adjective bonus, or "good", is inflected to
  agree with a noun that is masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case.
  In many polysynthetic languages, verbs cross-reference their subjects and objects.
  In these types of languages, a single verb may include information that would require
  an entire sentence in English. For example, in the Basque phrase ikusi nauzu, or
  "you saw me", the past tense auxiliary verb n-au-zu (similar to English "do") agrees
  with both the subject (you) expressed by the n- prefix, and with the object (me)
  expressed by the -zu suffix. The sentence could be directly transliterated as "see
  you-did-me"[79]Another way in which languages convey meaning is through the order
  of words within a sentence. The grammatical rules for how to produce new sentences
  from words that are already known is called syntax. The syntactical rules of a language
  determine why a sentence in English such as "I love you" is meaningful, but "*love
  you I" is not.[note 3] Syntactical rules determine how word order and sentence structure
  is constrained, and how those constraints contribute to meaning.[80] For example,
  in English, the two sentences "the slaves were cursing the master" and "the master
  was cursing the slaves" mean different things, because the role of the grammatical
  subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the verb, and the role of object
  is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb. Conversely, in Latin, both Dominus
  servos vituperabat and Servos vituperabat dominus mean "the master was reprimanding
  the slaves", because servos, or "slaves", is in the accusative case, showing that
  they are the grammatical object of the sentence, and dominus, or "master", is in
  the nominative case, showing that he is the subject.[81]Latin uses morphology to
  express the distinction between subject and object, whereas English uses word order.
  Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of inverse
  word order in questions, which exists in many languages. This rule explains why
  when in English, the phrase "John is talking to Lucy" is turned into a question,
  it becomes "Who is John talking to?", and not "John is talking to who?". The latter
  example may be used as a way of placing special emphasis on "who", thereby slightly
  altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes the rules for how complex
  sentences are structured by grouping words together in units, called phrases, that
  can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure. Sentences can be described
  as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure, connecting the phrases to
  each other at different levels.[82] To the right is a graphic representation of
  the syntactic analysis of the English sentence "the cat sat on the mat". The sentence
  is analyzed as being constituted by a noun phrase, a verb, and a prepositional phrase;
  the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase,
  and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun.[83]The reason sentences can
  be seen as being composed of phrases is because each phrase would be moved around
  as a single element if syntactic operations were carried out. For example, "the
  cat" is one phrase, and "on the mat" is another, because they would be treated as
  single units if a decision was made to emphasize the location by moving forward
  the prepositional phrase: "[And] on the mat, the cat sat".[83] There are many different
  formalist and functionalist frameworks that propose theories for describing syntactic
  structures, based on different assumptions about what language is and how it should
  be described. Each of them would analyze a sentence such as this in a different
  manner.[17]Languages can be classified in relation to their grammatical types. Languages
  that belong to different families nonetheless often have features in common, and
  these shared features tend to correlate.[84] For example, languages can be classified
  on the basis of their basic word order, the relative order of the verb, and its
  constituents in a normal indicative sentence. In English, the basic order is SVO:
  "The snake(S) bit(V) the man(O)", whereas for example, the corresponding sentence
  in the Australian language Gamilaraay would be d̪uyugu n̪ama d̪ayn yiːy (snake man
  bit), SOV.[85] Word order type is relevant as a typological parameter, because basic
  word order type corresponds with other syntactic parameters, such as the relative
  order of nouns and adjectives, or of the use of prepositions or postpositions. Such
  correlations are called implicational universals.[86] For example, most (but not
  all) languages that are of the SOV type have postpositions rather than prepositions,
  and have adjectives before nouns.[87]All languages structure sentences into Subject,
  Verb, and Object, but languages differ in the way they classify the relations between
  actors and actions. English uses the nominative-accusative word typology: in English
  transitive clauses, the subjects of both intransitive sentences ("I run") and transitive
  sentences ("I love you") are treated in the same way, shown here by the nominative
  pronoun I. Some languages, called ergative, Gamilaraay among them, distinguish instead
  between Agents and Patients. In ergative languages, the single participant in an
  intransitive sentence, such as "I run", is treated the same as the patient in a
  transitive sentence, giving the equivalent of "me run" and "you love me". Only in
  transitive sentences would the equivalent of the pronoun "I" be used.[85] In this
  way the semantic roles can map onto the grammatical relations in different ways,
  grouping an intransitive subject either with Agents (accusative type) or Patients
  (ergative type) or even making each of the three roles differently, which is called
  the tripartite type.[88]The shared features of languages which belong to the same
  typological class type may have arisen completely independently. Their co-occurrence
  might be due to universal laws governing the structure of natural languages, "language
  universals", or they might be the result of languages evolving convergent solutions
  to the recurring communicative problems that humans use language to solve.[18]While
  humans have the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in
  an environment in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore
  dependent on communities of speakers in which children learn language from their
  elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages
  are used by those who speak them to communicate and to solve a plethora of social
  tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these
  purposes.[18] Due to the way in which language is transmitted between generations
  and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages
  or converging due to language contact. The process is similar to the process of
  evolution, where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation
  of a phylogenetic tree.[90]However, languages differ from a biological organisms
  in that they readily incorporate elements from other languages through the process
  of diffusion, as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also
  frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their first language or languages
  as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased
  language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming endangered
  as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate
  in larger and more influential speech communities.[91]The semantic study of meaning
  assumes that meaning is located in a relation between signs and meanings that are
  firmly established through social convention. However, semantics does not study
  the way in which social conventions are made and affect language. Rather, when studying
  the way in which words and signs are used, it is often the case that words have
  different meanings, depending on the social context of use. An important example
  of this is the process called deixis, which describes the way in which certain words
  refer to entities through their relation between a specific point in time and space
  when the word is uttered. Such words are, for example, the word, "I" (which designates
  the person speaking), "now" (which designates the moment of speaking), and "here"
  (which designates the time of speaking). Signs also change their meanings over time,
  as the conventions governing their usage gradually change. The study of how the
  meaning of linguistic expressions changes depending on context is called pragmatics.
  Deixis is an important part of the way that we use language to point out entities
  in the world.[92] Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is
  patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning. For example, in all languages,
  linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information, but to perform
  actions. Certain actions are made only through language, but nonetheless have tangible
  effects, e.g. the act of "naming", which creates a new name for some entity, or
  the act of "pronouncing someone man and wife", which creates a social contract of
  marriage. These types of acts are called speech acts, although they can of course
  also be carried out through writing or hand signing.[93]The form of linguistic expression
  often does not correspond to the meaning that it actually has in a social context.
  For example, if at a dinner table a person asks, "Can you reach the salt?", that
  is, in fact, not a question about the length of the arms of the one being addressed,
  but a request to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the
  context in which it is spoken; these kinds of effects of meaning are called conversational
  implicatures. These social rules for which ways of using language are considered
  appropriate in certain situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation
  to their context vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of
  acquiring communicative competence in a language.[94]All healthy, normally developing
  human beings learn to use language. Children acquire the language or languages used
  around them: whichever languages they receive sufficient exposure to during childhood.
  The development is essentially the same for children acquiring sign or oral languages.[95]
  This learning process is referred to as first-language acquisition, since unlike
  many other kinds of learning, it requires no direct teaching or specialized study.
  In The Descent of Man, naturalist Charles Darwin called this process "an instinctive
  tendency to acquire an art".[10]First language acquisition proceeds in a fairly
  regular sequence, though there is a wide degree of variation in the timing of particular
  stages among normally developing infants. From birth, newborns respond more readily
  to human speech than to other sounds. Around one month of age, babies appear to
  be able to distinguish between different speech sounds. Around six months of age,
  a child will begin babbling, producing the speech sounds or handshapes of the languages
  used around them. Words appear around the age of 12 to 18 months; the average vocabulary
  of an eighteen-month-old child is around 50 words. A child''s first utterances are
  holophrases (literally "whole-sentences"), utterances that use just one word to
  communicate some idea. Several months after a child begins producing words, she
  or he will produce two-word utterances, and within a few more months will begin
  to produce telegraphic speech, or short sentences that are less grammatically complex
  than adult speech, but that do show regular syntactic structure. From roughly the
  age of three to five years, a child''s ability to speak or sign is refined to the
  point that it resembles adult language.[96][97] Studies published in 2013 have indicated
  that unborn fetuses are capable of language acquisition to some degree.[98][99]Acquisition
  of second and additional languages can come at any age, through exposure in daily
  life or courses. Children learning a second language are more likely to achieve
  native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking
  a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference
  between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the
  process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner
  already knows.[100]Languages, understood as the particular set of speech norms of
  a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that
  speaks them. Languages differ not only in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar,
  but also through having different "cultures of speaking." Humans use language as
  a way of signalling identity with one cultural group as well as difference from
  others. Even among speakers of one language, several different ways of using the
  language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups
  within a larger culture. Linguists and anthropologists, particularly sociolinguists,
  ethnolinguists, and linguistic anthropologists have specialized in studying how
  ways of speaking vary between speech communities.[101]Linguists use the term "varieties"
  to refer to the different ways of speaking a language. This term includes geographically
  or socioculturally defined dialects as well as the jargons or styles of subcultures.
  Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style
  as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.[102]Because
  norms for language use are shared by members of a specific group, communicative
  style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic
  differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example,
  speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority
  or social class, one''s area of origin, or status as a second language speaker.
  These kinds of differences are not part of the linguistic system, but are an important
  part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.[103]However,
  many languages also have grammatical conventions that signal the social position
  of the speaker in relation to others through the use of registers that are related
  to social hierarchies or divisions. In many languages, there are stylistic or even
  grammatical differences between the ways men and women speak, between age groups,
  or between social classes, just as some languages employ different words depending
  on who is listening. For example, in the Australian language Dyirbal, a married
  man must use a special set of words to refer to everyday items when speaking in
  the presence of his mother-in-law.[104] Some cultures, for example, have elaborate
  systems of "social deixis", or systems of signalling social distance through linguistic
  means.[105] In English, social deixis is shown mostly through distinguishing between
  addressing some people by first name and others by surname, and in titles such as
  "Mrs.", "boy", "Doctor", or "Your Honor", but in other languages, such systems may
  be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language.
  For instance, in languages of east Asia such as Thai, Burmese, and Javanese, different
  words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or
  lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the
  lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.[105]Throughout history a
  number of different ways of representing language in graphic media have been invented.
  These are called writing systems.The use of writing has made language even more
  useful to humans. It makes it possible to store large amounts of information outside
  of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances
  that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different
  genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities,
  writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one
  spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive
  development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit
  and formal education.[106]The invention of the first writing systems is roughly
  contemporary with the beginning of the Bronze Age in the late 4th millennium BC.
  The Sumerian archaic cuneiform script and the Egyptian hieroglyphs are generally
  considered to be the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral
  proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with the earliest coherent texts
  from about 2600 BC. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent
  invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely
  independently of Sumerian, or was a case of cultural diffusion. A similar debate
  exists for the Chinese script, which developed around 1200 BC. The pre-Columbian
  Mesoamerican writing systems (including among others Olmec and Maya scripts) are
  generally believed to have had independent origins.[68]All languages change as speakers
  adopt or invent new ways of speaking and pass them on to other members of their
  speech community. Language change happens at all levels from the phonological level
  to the levels of vocabulary, morphology, syntax, and discourse. Even though language
  change is often initially evaluated negatively by speakers of the language who often
  consider changes to be "decay" or a sign of slipping norms of language usage, it
  is natural and inevitable.[107]Changes may affect specific sounds or the entire
  phonological system. Sound change can consist of the replacement of one speech sound
  or phonetic feature by another, the complete loss of the affected sound, or even
  the introduction of a new sound in a place where there previously was none. Sound
  changes can be conditioned in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in
  the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be regular,
  which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions
  are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound
  changes can sometimes be sporadic, affecting only one particular word or a few words,
  without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a chain shift
  in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the Germanic
  languages when the sound change known as Grimm''s law affected all the stop consonants
  in the system. The original consonant *bʰ became /b/ in the Germanic languages,
  the previous *b in turn became /p/, and the previous *p became /f/. The same process
  applied to all stop consonants and explains why Italic languages such as Latin have
  p in words like pater and pisces, whereas Germanic languages, like English, have
  father and fish.[108]Another example is the Great Vowel Shift in English, which
  is the reason that the spelling of English vowels do not correspond well to their
  current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established
  orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change
  is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct
  and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused
  Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma''am.[109]Change
  also happens in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as idioms or
  particular constructions become grammaticalized. This frequently happens when words
  or morphemes erode and the grammatical system is unconsciously rearranged to compensate
  for the lost element. For example, in some varieties of Caribbean Spanish the final
  /s/ has eroded away. Since Standard Spanish uses final /s/ in the morpheme marking
  the second person subject "you" in verbs, the Caribbean varieties now have to express
  the second person using the pronoun tú. This means that the sentence "what''s your
  name" is ¿como te llamas? [''komo te ''jamas] in Standard Spanish, but [''komo ''tu
  te ''jama] in Caribbean Spanish. The simple sound change has affected both morphology
  and syntax.[110] Another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual petrification
  of idioms into new grammatical forms, for example, the way the English "going to"
  construction lost its aspect of movement and in some varieties of English has almost
  become a full-fledged future tense (e.g. I''m gonna).Language change may be motivated
  by "language internal" factors, such as changes in pronunciation motivated by certain
  sounds being difficult to distinguish aurally or to produce, or through patterns
  of change that cause some rare types of constructions to drift towards more common
  types.[111] Other causes of language change are social, such as when certain pronunciations
  become emblematic of membership in certain groups, such as social classes, or with
  ideologies, and therefore are adopted by those who wish to identify with those groups
  or ideas. In this way, issues of identity and politics can have profound effects
  on language structure.[112]One important source of language change is contact and
  resulting diffusion of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs
  when speakers of two or more languages or varieties interact on a regular basis.[113]Multilingualism
  is likely to have been the norm throughout human history and most people in the
  modern world are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the ethno-national
  state, monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small
  islands. But with the ideology that made one people, one state, and one language
  the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout
  the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding
  to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are multilingual and most
  languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.[114]When speakers
  of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence
  each other. Through sustained language contact over long periods, linguistic traits
  diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different families may converge
  to become more similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact, this
  may lead to the formation of language areas in which unrelated languages share a
  number of linguistic features. A number of such language areas have been documented,
  among them, the Balkan language area, the Mesoamerican language area, and the Ethiopian
  language area. Also, larger areas such as South Asia, Europe, and Southeast Asia
  have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of
  specific areal features.[115][116]Language contact may also lead to a variety of
  other linguistic phenomena, including language convergence, borrowing, and relexification
  (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In
  situations of extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation
  of new mixed languages that cannot be considered to belong to a single language
  family. One type of mixed language called pidgins occurs when adult speakers of
  two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither
  group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case,
  they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages,
  but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language
  comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in
  both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers,
  but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language.
  But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually
  children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation
  of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure
  and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called
  a creole language. An example of such mixed languages is Tok Pisin, the official
  language of Papua New-Guinea, which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English
  and Austronesian languages; others are Kreyòl ayisyen, the French-based creole language
  spoken in Haiti, and Michif, a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American
  language Cree and French.[117]SIL Ethnologue defines a "living language" as "one
  that has at least one speaker for whom it is their first language". The exact number
  of known living languages varies from 6,000 to 7,000, depending on the precision
  of one''s definition of "language", and in particular, on how one defines the distinction
  between languages and dialects. As of 2015, Ethnologue cataloged 7,102 living human
  languages.[119] The Ethnologue establishes linguistic groups based on studies of
  mutual intelligibility, and therefore often includes more categories than more conservative
  classifications. For example, the Danish language that most scholars consider a
  single language with several dialects is classified as two distinct languages (Danish
  and Jutish) by the Ethnologue.[118]According to the Ethnologue, 389 languages (nearly
  6%) have more than a million speakers. These languages together account for 94%
  of the world''s population, whereas 94% of the world''s languages account for the
  remaining 6% of the global population. To the right is a table of the world''s 10
  most spoken languages with population estimates from the Ethnologue (2009 figures).[118]There
  is no clear distinction between a language and a dialect, notwithstanding a famous
  aphorism attributed to linguist Max Weinreich that "a language is a dialect with
  an army and navy".[120] For example, national boundaries frequently override linguistic
  difference in determining whether two linguistic varieties are languages or dialects.
  Cantonese and Mandarin are, for example, often classified as "dialects" of Chinese,
  even though they are more different from each other than Swedish is from Norwegian.
  Before the Yugoslav civil war, Serbo-Croatian was considered a single language with
  two dialects, but now Croatian and Serbian are considered different languages and
  employ different writing systems. In other words, the distinction may hinge on political
  considerations as much as on cultural differences, distinctive writing systems,
  or degree of mutual intelligibility.[121]The world''s languages can be grouped into
  language families consisting of languages that can be shown to have common ancestry.
  Linguists recognize many hundreds of language families, although some of them can
  possibly be grouped into larger units as more evidence becomes available and in-depth
  studies are carried out. At present, there are also dozens of language isolates:
  languages that cannot be shown to be related to any other languages in the world.
  Among them are Basque, spoken in Europe, Zuni of New Mexico, Purépecha of Mexico,
  Ainu of Japan, Burushaski of Pakistan, and many others.[122]The language family
  of the world that has the most speakers is the Indo-European languages, spoken by
  46% of the world''s population.[123] This family includes major world languages
  like English, Spanish, Russian, and Hindustani (Hindi/Urdu). The Indo-European family
  achieved prevalence first during the Eurasian Migration Period (c. 400–800 AD)[citation
  needed], and subsequently through the European colonial expansion, which brought
  the Indo-European languages to a politically and often numerically dominant position
  in the Americas and much of Africa. The Sino-Tibetan languages are spoken by 20%[123]
  of the world''s population and include many of the languages of East Asia, including
  Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, and hundreds of smaller languages.[124]Africa is home
  to a large number of language families, the largest of which is the Niger-Congo
  language family, which includes such languages as Swahili, Shona, and Yoruba. Speakers
  of the Niger-Congo languages account for 6.9% of the world''s population.[123] A
  similar number of people speak the Afroasiatic languages, which include the populous
  Semitic languages such as Arabic, Hebrew language, and the languages of the Sahara
  region, such as the Berber languages and Hausa.[124]The Austronesian languages are
  spoken by 5.5% of the world''s population and stretch from Madagascar to maritime
  Southeast Asia all the way to Oceania.[123] It includes such languages as Malagasy,
  Māori, Samoan, and many of the indigenous languages of Indonesia and Taiwan. The
  Austronesian languages are considered to have originated in Taiwan around 3000 BC
  and spread through the Oceanic region through island-hopping, based on an advanced
  nautical technology. Other populous language families are the Dravidian languages
  of South Asia (among them Kannada Tamil and Telugu), the Turkic languages of Central
  Asia (such as Turkish), the Austroasiatic (among them Khmer), and Tai–Kadai languages
  of Southeast Asia (including Thai).[124]The areas of the world in which there is
  the greatest linguistic diversity, such as the Americas, Papua New Guinea, West
  Africa, and South-Asia, contain hundreds of small language families. These areas
  together account for the majority of the world''s languages, though not the majority
  of speakers. In the Americas, some of the largest language families include the
  Quechumaran, Arawak, and Tupi-Guarani families of South America, the Uto-Aztecan,
  Oto-Manguean, and Mayan of Mesoamerica, and the Na-Dene and Algonquian language
  families of North America. In Australia, most indigenous languages belong to the
  Pama-Nyungan family, whereas Papua-New Guinea is home to a large number of small
  families and isolates, as well as a number of Austronesian languages.[122]Language
  endangerment occurs when a language is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers
  die out or shift to speaking another language. Language loss occurs when the language
  has no more native speakers, and becomes a dead language. If eventually no one speaks
  the language at all, it becomes an extinct language. While languages have always
  gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated
  rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes of globalization and neo-colonialism,
  where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.[125]The more
  commonly spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less
  commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The total number
  of languages in the world is not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors.
  The consensus is that there are between 6,000[126] and 7,000 languages currently
  spoken (as of 2010), and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by
  the year 2100.[125] The top 20 languages, those spoken by more than 50 million speakers
  each, are spoken by 50% of the world''s population, whereas many of the other languages
  are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.[125]The
  United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) operates
  with five levels of language endangerment: "safe", "vulnerable" (not spoken by children
  outside the home), "definitely endangered" (not spoken by children), "severely endangered"
  (only spoken by the oldest generations), and "critically endangered" (spoken by
  few members of the oldest generation, often semi-speakers). Notwithstanding claims
  that the world would be better off if most adopted a single common lingua franca,
  such as English or Esperanto, there is a consensus that the loss of languages harms
  the cultural diversity of the world. It is a common belief, going back to the biblical
  narrative of the tower of Babel, that linguistic diversity causes political conflict,[27]
  but this is contradicted by the fact that many of the world''s major episodes of
  violence have taken place in situations with low linguistic diversity, such as the
  Yugoslav and American Civil War, or the genocide of Rwanda, whereas many of the
  most stable political units have been highly multilingual.[127]Many projects aim
  to prevent or slow this loss by revitalizing endangered languages and promoting
  education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries have
  enacted specific legislation to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous
  speech communities. A minority of linguists have argued that language loss is a
  natural process that should not be counteracted, and that documenting endangered
  languages for posterity is sufficient.[128]'

  of written language, but spoken language predates writing by at least tens of thousands
  of years.\n\n\n\nTwo girls learning American Sign Language\n\n\n\nBraille writing

  and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so,
  and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of
  language is called linguistics.\nQuestions concerning the philosophy of language,
  such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias
  and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language
  originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from
  rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued
  that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include
  Ferdinand de Saussure, Noam Chomsky and William C. Stokoe.\nEstimates of the number
  of languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. However, any precise estimate
  depends on a partly arbitrary distinction between languages and dialects. Natural
  languages are spoken or signed, but any language can be encoded into secondary media
  using auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli – for example, in graphic writing, braille,
  or whistling. This is because human language is modality-independent. Depending
  on philosophical perspectives regarding the definition of language and meaning,
  when used as a general concept, \"language\" may refer to the cognitive ability
  to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules
  that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from
  those rules. All languages rely on the process of semiosis to relate signs to particular
  meanings. Oral and sign languages contain a phonological system that governs how
  symbols are used to form sequences known as words or morphemes, and a syntactic
  system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances.\nHuman
  language has the properties of productivity, recursivity, and displacement, and
  relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords
  a much wider range of expressions than any known system of animal communication.
  Language is thought to have originated when early hominins started gradually changing
  their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a theory of other
  minds and a shared intentionality.[1][2] This development is sometimes thought to
  have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures
  of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions.
  Language is processed in many different locations in the human brain, but especially
  in Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Humans acquire language through social interaction
  in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently when they are approximately
  three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human culture. Therefore,
  in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and
  cultural uses, such as signifying group identity, social stratification, as well
  as social grooming and entertainment.\nLanguages evolve and diversify over time,
  and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages
  to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the
  later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common
  ancestor is known as a language family. The Indo-European family is the most widely
  spoken and includes English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, and Hindi; the Sino-Tibetan
  family, which includes Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, and Standard Tibetan; the Afro-Asiatic
  family, which includes Arabic, Amharic, Somali, and Hebrew; the Bantu languages,
  which include Swahili, Zulu, Shona, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout
  Africa; and the Malayo-Polynesian languages, which include Indonesian, Malay, Tagalog,
  Malagasy, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the Pacific. The languages
  of the Dravidian family that are spoken mostly in Southern India include Tamil,
  Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90%
  of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become
  extinct by the year 2100.\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1 Definitions\n1.1 Mental faculty,

  article: Philosophy of language\nThe English word language derives ultimately from
  Proto-Indo-European *dn̥ǵʰwéh₂s \"tongue, speech, language\" through Latin lingua,
  \"language; tongue\", and Old French language.[3] The word is sometimes used to
  refer to codes, ciphers, and other kinds of artificially constructed communication
  systems such as formally defined computer languages used for computer programming.
  Unlike conventional human languages, a formal language in this sense is a system
  of signs for encoding and decoding information. This article specifically concerns
  the properties of natural human language as it is studied in the discipline of linguistics.\nAs
  an object of linguistic study, \"language\" has two primary meanings: an abstract
  concept, and a specific linguistic system, e.g. \"French\". The Swiss linguist Ferdinand
  de Saussure, who defined the modern discipline of linguistics, first explicitly
  formulated the distinction using the French word langage for language as a concept,
  langue as a specific instance of a language system, and parole for the concrete
  usage of speech in a particular language.[4]\nWhen speaking of language as a general
  concept, definitions can be used which stress different aspects of the phenomenon.[5]
  These definitions also entail different approaches and understandings of language,
  and they inform different and often incompatible schools of linguistic theory.[6]
  Debates about the nature and origin of language go back to the ancient world. Greek
  philosophers such as Gorgias and Plato debated the relation between words, concepts
  and reality. Gorgias argued that language could represent neither the objective
  experience nor human experience, and that communication and truth were therefore
  impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible because language represents
  ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and prior to, language.[7]\nDuring
  the Enlightenment and its debates about human origins, it became fashionable to
  speculate about the origin of language. Thinkers such as Rousseau and Herder argued
  that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that
  it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational
  thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and Descartes held the opposite view.
  Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of
  language in shaping our experiences of the world – asking whether language simply
  reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that
  it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led to the question
  of whether philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence
  of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation
  of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language,
  is associated with what has been called the linguistic turn and philosophers such
  as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation
  to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.[8]\nMental
  faculty, organ or instinct[edit]\nOne definition sees language primarily as the
  mental faculty that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages
  and to produce and understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality
  of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human
  capacity for language as a unique development of the human brain. Proponents of
  the view that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this
  is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment
  where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages
  may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together
  without a common language; for example, creole languages and spontaneously developed
  sign languages such as Nicaraguan Sign Language. This view, which can be traced
  back to the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely
  innate, for example, in Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar, or American philosopher
  Jerry Fodor's extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied
  in studies of language within a cognitive science framework and in neurolinguistics.[9][10]\nFormal
  symbolic system[edit]\nAnother definition sees language as a formal system of signs
  governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition
  stresses that human languages can be described as closed structural systems consisting
  of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings.[11] This structuralist
  view of language was first introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure,[12] and his structuralism
  remains foundational for many approaches to language.[13]\nSome proponents of Saussure's
  view of language have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure
  by identifying its basic elements and then by presenting a formal account of the
  rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences.
  The main proponent of such a theory is Noam Chomsky, the originator of the generative
  theory of grammar, who has defined language as the construction of sentences that
  can be generated using transformational grammars.[14] Chomsky considers these rules
  to be an innate feature of the human mind and to constitute the rudiments of what
  language is.[15] By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly
  used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in formal logic,
  in formal theories of grammar, and in applied computational linguistics.[16][17]
  In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the
  logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers
  such as Alfred Tarski, Bertrand Russell, and other formal logicians.\nTool for communication[edit]\n\n\n\n\nTwo
  men and a woman having a conversation in American Sign Language\n\n\nYet another
  definition sees language as a system of communication that enables humans to exchange
  verbal or symbolic utterances. This definition stresses the social functions of
  language and the fact that humans use it to express themselves and to manipulate
  objects in their environment. Functional theories of grammar explain grammatical
  structures by their communicative functions, and understand the grammatical structures
  of language to be the result of an adaptive process by which grammar was \"tailored\"
  to serve the communicative needs of its users.[18][19]\nThis view of language is
  associated with the study of language in pragmatic, cognitive, and interactive frameworks,
  as well as in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Functionalist theories
  tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the
  process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance
  on the study of linguistic typology, or the classification of languages according
  to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of grammaticalization
  tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology.[17] In the philosophy
  of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is
  often associated with Wittgenstein's later works and with ordinary language philosophers
  such as J. L. Austin, Paul Grice, John Searle, and W. O. Quine.[20]\nUnique status
  of human language[edit]\nMain articles: Animal language and Great ape language\nHuman
  language is unique in comparison to other forms of communication, such as those
  used by non-human animals. Communication systems used by other animals such as bees
  or apes are closed systems that consist of a finite, usually very limited, number
  of possible ideas that can be expressed.[21]\nIn contrast, human language is open-ended
  and productive, meaning that it allows humans to produce a vast range of utterances
  from a finite set of elements, and to create new words and sentences. This is possible
  because human language is based on a dual code, in which a finite number of elements
  which are meaningless in themselves (e.g. sounds, letters or gestures) can be combined
  to form a theoretically infinite number of larger units of meaning (words and sentences).[22]
  Furthermore, the symbols and grammatical rules of any particular language are largely
  arbitrary, so that the system can only be acquired through social interaction.[23]
  The known systems of communication used by animals, on the other hand, can only
  express a finite number of utterances that are mostly genetically determined.[24]\nSeveral
  species of animals have proved to be able to acquire forms of communication through
  social learning: for instance a bonobo named Kanzi learned to express itself using
  a set of symbolic lexigrams. Similarly, many species of birds and whales learn their
  songs by imitating other members of their species. However, while some animals may
  acquire large numbers of words and symbols,[note 1] none have been able to learn
  as many different signs as are generally known by an average 4 year old human, nor
  have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language.[25]\nHuman
  languages also differ from animal communication systems in that they employ grammatical
  and semantic categories, such as noun and verb, present and past, which may be used
  to express exceedingly complex meanings.[25] Human language is also unique in having
  the property of recursivity: for example, a noun phrase can contain another noun
  phrase (as in \"[[the chimpanzee]'s lips]\") or a clause can contain another clause
  (as in \"[I see [the dog is running]]\").[2] Human language is also the only known
  natural communication system whose adaptability may be referred to as modality independent.
  This means that it can be used not only for communication through one channel or
  medium, but through several. For example, spoken language uses the auditive modality,
  whereas sign languages and writing use the visual modality, and braille writing
  uses the tactile modality.[26]\nHuman language is also unique in being able to refer
  to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events that
  took place in the past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events
  that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called displacement,
  and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication
  of bees that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight),
  the degree to which it is used in human language is also considered unique.[22]\nOrigin[edit]\nMain

  Tower of Babel\" by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Oil on board, 1563.\nHumans have speculated
  about the origins of language throughout history. The Biblical myth of the Tower
  of Babel is one such account; other cultures have different stories of how language
  arose.[27]\n\n\n\nTheories about the origin of language differ in regard to their
  basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are based on the idea that
  language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing
  in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems
  among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories.
  The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot
  be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared
  suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be
  defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on Chomsky's generative
  view of language see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically
  encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is largely cultural,
  learned through social interaction.[28]\nThe only prominent proponent of a discontinuity-based
  theory of human language origins is linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky.[28] Chomsky
  proposes that \"some random mutation took place, maybe after some strange cosmic
  ray shower, and it reorganized the brain, implanting a language organ in an otherwise
  primate brain.\"[29] Though cautioning against taking this story too literally,
  Chomsky insists that \"it may be closer to reality than many other fairy tales that
  are told about evolutionary processes, including language.\"[29]\nContinuity-based
  theories are held by a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision
  this development. Those who see language as being mostly innate, for example psychologist
  Steven Pinker, hold the precedents to be animal cognition,[10] whereas those who
  see language as a socially learned tool of communication, such as psychologist Michael
  Tomasello, see it as having developed from animal communication in primates: either
  gestural or vocal communication to assist in cooperation.[24] Other continuity-based
  models see language as having developed from music, a view already espoused by Rousseau,
  Herder, Humboldt, and Charles Darwin. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist
  Steven Mithen.[30]Stephen Anderson states that the age of spoken languages is estimated
  at 60,000 to 100,000 years[31] and that:\n\nResearchers on the evolutionary origin
  of language generally find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only
  once, and that all modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if
  that relation can no longer be recovered ... because of limitations on the methods
  available for reconstruction.[32]\n\nBecause language emerged in the early prehistory
  of man, its early development has left no historical traces, and it is believed
  that no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity
  often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can
  be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. And early human
  fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic
  forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic
  abilities are the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a larynx
  capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured
  artifacts.[33]\nIt is mostly undisputed that pre-human australopithecines did not
  have communication systems significantly different from those found in great apes
  in general, but scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance
  of the genus Homo some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development
  of primitive language-like systems (proto-language) as early as Homo habilis (2.3
  million years ago) while others place the development of primitive symbolic communication
  only with Homo erectus (1.8 million years ago) or Homo heidelbergensis (0.6 million
  years ago), and the development of language proper with Anatomically Modern Homo
  sapiens with the Upper Paleolithic revolution less than 100,000 years ago.[34][35]\nThe

  articles: Linguistics and History of linguistics\nThe study of language, linguistics,
  has been developing into a science since the first grammatical descriptions of particular
  languages in India more than 2000 years ago. Modern linguistics is a science that
  concerns itself with all aspects of language, examining it from all of the theoretical
  viewpoints described above.[36]\nSubdisciplines[edit]\nThe academic study of language
  is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical
  angles, all of which inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, descriptive
  linguistics examines the grammar of single languages, theoretical linguistics develops
  theories on how best to conceptualize and define the nature of language based on
  data from the various extant human languages, sociolinguistics studies how languages
  are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions
  of language and grammatical description, neurolinguistics studies how language is
  processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, computational
  linguistics builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational
  models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic
  hypotheses, and historical linguistics relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions
  of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language
  families by using the comparative method.[37]\nEarly history[edit]\nThe formal study
  of language is often considered to have started in India with Pāṇini, the 5th century
  BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of Sanskrit morphology. However, Sumerian
  scribes already studied the differences between Sumerian and Akkadian grammar around
  1900 BC. Subsequent grammatical traditions developed in all of the ancient cultures
  that adopted writing.[38]\nIn the 17th century AD, the French Port-Royal Grammarians
  developed the idea that the grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal
  basics of thought, and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century,
  the first use of the comparative method by British philologist and expert on ancient
  India William Jones sparked the rise of comparative linguistics.[39] The scientific
  study of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by Wilhelm
  von Humboldt. Early in the 20th century, Ferdinand de Saussure introduced the idea
  of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions
  between them.[12]\nBy introducing a distinction between diachronic and synchronic
  analyses of language, he laid the foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics.
  Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are
  still fundamental in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions
  between syntagm and paradigm, and the Langue-parole distinction, distinguishing
  language as an abstract system (langue), from language as a concrete manifestation
  of this system (parole).[40]\nContemporary linguistics[edit]\nIn the 1960s, Noam
  Chomsky formulated the generative theory of language. According to this theory,
  the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules that is universal for
  all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of
  rules is called Universal Grammar; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective
  of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual
  languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce
  the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability
  is generated.[41]\nIn opposition to the formal theories of the generative school,
  functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool,
  its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions.
  Formal theories of grammar seek to define the different elements of language and
  describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations,
  while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and
  then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out.[17][note 2] The
  framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of the concepts
  (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language)
  which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how
  the mind creates meaning through language.[42]\nPhysiological and neural architecture
  of language and speech[edit]\nSpeaking is the default modality for language in all
  cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities
  for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus, the
  ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus required
  for acquiring and producing language.[43] The study of the genetic bases for human
  language is at an early stage: the only gene that has definitely been implicated
  in language production is FOXP2, which may cause a kind of congenital language disorder
  if affected by mutations.[44]\nThe brain and language[edit]\nMain article: Neurolinguistics\n\n\n\n\nLanguage
  Areas of the brain. The Angular Gyrus is represented in orange, Supramarginal Gyrus
  is represented in yellow, Broca's area is represented in blue, Wernicke's area is
  represented in green, and the Primary Auditory Cortex is represented in pink.\n\n\nThe
  brain is the coordinating center of all linguistic activity; it controls both the
  production of linguistic cognition and of meaning and the mechanics of speech production.
  Nonetheless, our knowledge of the neurological bases for language is quite limited,
  though it has advanced considerably with the use of modern imaging techniques. The
  discipline of linguistics dedicated to studying the neurological aspects of language
  is called neurolinguistics.[45]\nEarly work in neurolinguistics involved the study
  of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect
  language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered
  that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The
  first area is Wernicke's area, which is located in the posterior section of the
  superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion
  in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition in which there
  is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding
  rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area,
  located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People
  with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what
  they want to say, they just cannot get it out.[46] They are typically able to understand
  what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may
  be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding,
  word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences,
  both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech
  and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences.
  Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous
  ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign
  slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will
  sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending
  others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use
  language, not to the physiology used for speech production.[47][48]\nWith technological
  advances in the late 20th century, neurolinguists have also incorporated non-invasive
  techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiology
  to study language processing in individuals without impairments.[45]\nAnatomy of
  speech[edit]\nMain articles: Speech production, Phonetics and Articulatory phonetics\n\n\n\n\nThe

  in Mandarin Chinese.\n\n\n\nSpoken language relies on human physical ability to
  produce sound, which is a longitudinal wave propagated through the air at a frequency
  capable of vibrating the ear drum. This ability depends on the physiology of the
  human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box (larynx),
  and the upper vocal tract – the throat, the mouth, and the nose. By controlling
  the different parts of the speech apparatus, the airstream can be manipulated to
  produce different speech sounds.[49]\nThe sound of speech can be analyzed into a
  combination of segmental and suprasegmental elements. The segmental elements are
  those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct
  letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech,
  there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are
  there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by
  their distinct sounds which are a result of their different articulations, and they
  can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements
  as stress, phonation type, voice timbre, and prosody or intonation, all of which
  may have effects across multiple segments.[50]\nConsonants and vowel segments combine
  to form syllables, which in turn combine to form utterances; these can be distinguished
  phonetically as the space between two inhalations. Acoustically, these different
  segments are characterized by different formant structures, that are visible in
  a spectrogram of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram of the
  formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude peaks in
  the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.[50][51]\nVowels are those sounds that
  have no audible friction caused by the narrowing or obstruction of some part of
  the upper vocal tract. They vary in quality according to the degree of lip aperture
  and the placement of the tongue within the oral cavity.[50] Vowels are called close
  when the lips are relatively closed, as in the pronunciation of the vowel [i] (English
  \"ee\"), or open when the lips are relatively open, as in the vowel [a] (English
  \"ah\"). If the tongue is located towards the back of the mouth, the quality changes,
  creating vowels such as [u] (English \"oo\"). The quality also changes depending
  on whether the lips are rounded as opposed to unrounded, creating distinctions such
  as that between [i] (unrounded front vowel such as English \"ee\") and [y] (rounded
  front vowel such as German \"ü\").[52]\nConsonants are those sounds that have audible
  friction or closure at some point within the upper vocal tract. Consonant sounds
  vary by place of articulation, i.e. the place in the vocal tract where the airflow
  is obstructed, commonly at the lips, teeth, alveolar ridge, palate, velum, uvula,
  or glottis. Each place of articulation produces a different set of consonant sounds,
  which are further distinguished by manner of articulation, or the kind of friction,
  whether full closure, in which case the consonant is called occlusive or stop, or
  different degrees of aperture creating fricatives and approximants. Consonants can
  also be either voiced or unvoiced, depending on whether the vocal cords are set
  in vibration by airflow during the production of the sound. Voicing is what separates
  English [s] in bus (unvoiced sibilant) from [z] in buzz (voiced sibilant).[53]\nSome
  speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve release of air flow through the
  nasal cavity, and these are called nasals or nasalized sounds. Other sounds are
  defined by the way the tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called
  laterals, because the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds
  (called rhotics) that are characterized by how the tongue is positioned relative
  to the air stream.[51]\nBy using these speech organs, humans can produce hundreds
  of distinct sounds: some appear very often in the world's languages, whereas others
  are much more common in certain language families, language areas, or even specific
  to a single language.[54]\nStructure[edit]\nWhen described as a system of symbolic
  communication, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: signs,
  meanings, and a code connecting signs with their meanings. The study of the process
  of semiosis, how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called
  semiotics. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending
  on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined
  into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign
  is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes
  it.[55]\n\n\n\n\nAncient Tamil inscription at Thanjavur\n\n\nSome of the properties
  that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness
  of the linguistic sign, meaning that there is no predictable connection between
  a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, meaning
  that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures
  that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases;
  the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which
  linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that
  can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the
  productivity of the linguistic system, meaning that the finite number of linguistic
  elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.[55]\nThe
  rules by which signs can be combined to form words and phrases are called syntax
  or grammar. The meaning that is connected to individual signs, morphemes, words,
  phrases, and texts is called semantics.[56] The division of language into separate
  but connected systems of sign and meaning goes back to the first linguistic studies
  of de Saussure and is now used in almost all branches of linguistics.[57]\nSemantics[edit]\nMain
  articles: Semantics, Semiotics and Meaning (linguistics)\nLanguages express meaning
  by relating a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must be something
  that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related
  to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning
  for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be
  considered arbitrary, in the sense that the convention is established socially and
  historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign
  form and its meaning.\nThus, languages must have a vocabulary of signs related to
  specific meaning. The English sign \"dog\" denotes, for example, a member of the
  species Canis familiaris. In a language, the array of arbitrary signs connected
  to specific meanings is called the lexicon, and a single sign connected to a meaning
  is called a lexeme. Not all meanings in a language are represented by single words.
  Often, semantic concepts are embedded in the morphology or syntax of the language
  in the form of grammatical categories.[58]\nAll languages contain the semantic structure
  of predication: a structure that predicates a property, state, or action. Traditionally,
  semantics has been understood to be the study of how speakers and interpreters assign
  truth values to statements, so that meaning is understood to be the process by which
  a predicate can be said to be true or false about an entity, e.g. \"[x [is y]]\"
  or \"[x [does y]]\". Recently, this model of semantics has been complemented with
  more dynamic models of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the context
  in which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning. Such models of meaning
  are explored in the field of pragmatics.[58]\nSounds and symbols[edit]\nMain articles:

  word \"man\", which is written phonetically as [mæn]. Note that in flowing speech,

  apparatus moves.\n\n\n\nThe syllable \"wi\" in the Hangul script.\n\n\n\nThe sign
  for \"wi\" in Korean Sign Language\n\n\n\nDepending on modality, language structure
  can be based on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic
  or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to
  construct meaning are studied in phonology.[59] The study of how humans produce
  and perceive vocal sounds is called phonetics.[60] In spoken language, meaning is
  produced when sounds become part of a system in which some sounds can contribute
  to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, only a limited number
  of the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute
  to constructing meaning.[54]\nSounds as part of a linguistic system are called phonemes.[61]
  Phonemes are abstract units of sound, defined as the smallest units in a language
  that can serve to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally different
  words, a so-called minimal pair. In English, for example, the words bat [bæt] and
  pat [pʰæt] form a minimal pair, in which the distinction between /b/ and /p/ differentiates
  the two words, which have different meanings. However, each language contrasts sounds
  in different ways. For example, in a language that does not distinguish between
  voiced and unvoiced consonants, the sounds [p] and [b] (if they both occur) could
  be considered a single phoneme, and consequently, the two pronunciations would have
  the same meaning. Similarly, the English language does not distinguish phonemically
  between aspirated and non-aspirated pronunciations of consonants, as many other
  languages do: the unaspirated /p/ in spin [spɪn] and the aspirated /p/ in pin [pʰɪn]
  are considered to be merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme (such
  variants of a single phoneme are called allophones), whereas in Mandarin Chinese,
  the same difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words [pʰá] 'crouch'
  and [pá] 'eight' (the accent above the á means that the vowel is pronounced with
  a high tone).[62]\nAll spoken languages have phonemes of at least two different
  categories, vowels and consonants, that can be combined to form syllables.[50] As
  well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in
  other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use stress, pitch, duration,
  and tone to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the
  level of single segments, they are called suprasegmental.[63] Some languages have
  only a few phonemes, for example, Rotokas and Pirahã language with 11 and 10 phonemes
  respectively, whereas languages like Taa may have as many as 141 phonemes.[62] In
  sign languages, the equivalent to phonemes (formerly called cheremes) are defined
  by the basic elements of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and
  motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.[64][65][66]\nWriting
  systems represent language using visual symbols, which may or may not correspond
  to the sounds of spoken language. The Latin alphabet (and those on which it is based
  or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of
  single sounds, so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote
  a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such
  as the Inuktitut syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In logographic
  scripts, each sign represents an entire word,[67] and will generally bear no relation
  to the sound of that word in spoken language.\nBecause all languages have a very
  large number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written
  language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by
  arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction
  used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some
  writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right
  to left as the Arabic script), while others such as traditional Chinese writing
  use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite
  directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can
  be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction
  of reading.[68]\nIn order to represent the sounds of the world's languages in writing,
  linguists have developed the International Phonetic Alphabet, designed to represent
  all of the discrete sounds that are known to contribute to meaning in human languages.[69]\nGrammar[edit]\nMain
  article: Grammar\nGrammar is the study of how meaningful elements called morphemes
  within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free
  or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually
  called words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called
  affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language
  is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called morphology.
  The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.[70]\nGrammatical
  categories[edit]\nMain article: Grammatical category\nGrammar can be described as
  a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine
  to form different aspects of meaning.[71] Languages differ widely in whether they
  are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories
  are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding
  of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing
  between their relations to a predicate, the encoding of temporal and spatial relations
  on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction
  between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.[72]\nWord
  classes[edit]\nLanguages organize their parts of speech into classes according to
  their functions and positions relative to other parts. All languages, for instance,
  make a basic distinction between a group of words that prototypically denotes things
  and concepts and a group of words that prototypically denotes actions and events.
  The first group, which includes English words such as \"dog\" and \"song\", are
  usually called nouns. The second, which includes \"run\" and \"sing\", are called
  verbs. Another common category is the adjective: words that describe properties
  or qualities of nouns, such as \"red\" or \"big\". Word classes can be \"open\"
  if new words can continuously be added to the class, or relatively \"closed\" if
  there is a fixed number of words in a class. In English, the class of pronouns is
  closed, whereas the class of adjectives is open, since an infinite number of adjectives
  can be constructed from verbs (e.g. \"saddened\") or nouns (e.g. with the -like
  suffix, as in \"noun-like\"). In other languages such as Korean, the situation is
  the opposite, and new pronouns can be constructed, whereas the number of adjectives
  is fixed.[73]\nWord classes also carry out differing functions in grammar. Prototypically,
  verbs are used to construct predicates, while nouns are used as arguments of predicates.
  In a sentence such as \"Sally runs\", the predicate is \"runs\", because it is the
  word that predicates a specific state about its argument \"Sally\". Some verbs such
  as \"curse\" can take two arguments, e.g. \"Sally cursed John\". A predicate that
  can only take a single argument is called intransitive, while a predicate that can
  take two arguments is called transitive.[74]\nMany other word classes exist in different
  languages, such as conjunctions like \"and\" that serve to join two sentences, articles
  that introduce a noun, interjections such as \"wow!\", or ideophones like \"splash\"
  that mimic the sound of some event. Some languages have positionals that describe
  the spatial position of an event or entity. Many languages have classifiers that
  identify countable nouns as belonging to a particular type or having a particular
  shape. For instance, in Japanese, the general noun classifier for humans is nin
  (人), and it is used for counting humans, whatever they are called:[75]\nsan-nin
  no gakusei (三人の学生) lit. \"3 human-classifier of student\" — three students\nFor
  trees, it would be:\nsan-bon no ki (三本の木) lit. \"3 classifier-for-long-objects of
  tree\" — three trees\nMorphology[edit]\nIn linguistics, the study of the internal
  structure of complex words and the processes by which words are formed is called
  morphology. In most languages, it is possible to construct complex words that are
  built of several morphemes. For instance, the English word \"unexpected\" can be
  analyzed as being composed of the three morphemes \"un-\", \"expect\" and \"-ed\".[76]\nMorphemes
  can be classified according to whether they are independent morphemes, so-called
  roots, or whether they can only co-occur attached to other morphemes. These bound
  morphemes or affixes can be classified according to their position in relation to
  the root: prefixes precede the root, suffixes follow the root, and infixes are inserted
  in the middle of a root. Affixes serve to modify or elaborate the meaning of the
  root. Some languages change the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure
  of a word, for example, the English word \"run\", which in the past tense is \"ran\".
  This process is called ablaut. Furthermore, morphology distinguishes between the
  process of inflection, which modifies or elaborates on a word, and the process of
  derivation, which creates a new word from an existing one. In English, the verb
  \"sing\" has the inflectional forms \"singing\" and \"sung\", which are both verbs,
  and the derivational form \"singer\", which is a noun derived from the verb with
  the agentive suffix \"-er\".[77]\nLanguages differ widely in how much they rely
  on morphological processes of word formation. In some languages, for example, Chinese,
  there are no morphological processes, and all grammatical information is encoded
  syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type of morpho-syntax is
  often called isolating, or analytic, because there is almost a full correspondence
  between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most languages have words
  consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in the degree to which morphemes
  are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European languages,
  single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into
  smaller segments. For example, in Latin, the word bonus, or \"good\", consists of
  the root bon-, meaning \"good\", and the suffix -us, which indicates masculine gender,
  singular number, and nominative case. These languages are called fusional languages,
  because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite of fusional
  languages are agglutinative languages which construct words by stringing morphemes
  together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit. An example
  of such a language is Turkish, where for example, the word evlerinizden, or \"from
  your houses\", consists of the morphemes, ev-ler-iniz-den with the meanings house-plural-your-from.
  The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called
  polysynthetic languages. They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence
  in a single word. For example, in Persian the single word nafahmidamesh means I
  didn't understand it consisting of morphemes na-fahm-id-am-esh with the meanings,
  \"negation.understand.past.I.it\". As another example with more complexity, in the
  Yupik word tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq, which means \"He had not yet said again
  that he was going to hunt reindeer\", the word consists of the morphemes tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq
  with the meanings, \"reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative\",
  and except for the morpheme tuntu (\"reindeer\") none of the other morphemes can
  appear in isolation.[78]\nMany languages use morphology to cross-reference words
  within a sentence. This is sometimes called agreement. For example, in many Indo-European
  languages, adjectives must cross-reference the noun they modify in terms of number,
  case, and gender, so that the Latin adjective bonus, or \"good\", is inflected to
  agree with a noun that is masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case.
  In many polysynthetic languages, verbs cross-reference their subjects and objects.
  In these types of languages, a single verb may include information that would require
  an entire sentence in English. For example, in the Basque phrase ikusi nauzu, or
  \"you saw me\", the past tense auxiliary verb n-au-zu (similar to English \"do\")
  agrees with both the subject (you) expressed by the n- prefix, and with the object
  (me) expressed by the -zu suffix. The sentence could be directly transliterated
  as \"see you-did-me\"[79]\nSyntax[edit]\nMain article: Syntax\n\n\n\n\nIn addition
  to word classes, a sentence can be analyzed in terms of grammatical functions: \"The
  cat\" is the subject of the phrase, \"on the mat\" is a locative phrase, and \"sat\"
  is the core of the predicate.\n\n\nAnother way in which languages convey meaning
  is through the order of words within a sentence. The grammatical rules for how to
  produce new sentences from words that are already known is called syntax. The syntactical
  rules of a language determine why a sentence in English such as \"I love you\" is
  meaningful, but \"*love you I\" is not.[note 3] Syntactical rules determine how
  word order and sentence structure is constrained, and how those constraints contribute
  to meaning.[80] For example, in English, the two sentences \"the slaves were cursing
  the master\" and \"the master was cursing the slaves\" mean different things, because
  the role of the grammatical subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the
  verb, and the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb. Conversely,
  in Latin, both Dominus servos vituperabat and Servos vituperabat dominus mean \"the
  master was reprimanding the slaves\", because servos, or \"slaves\", is in the accusative
  case, showing that they are the grammatical object of the sentence, and dominus,
  or \"master\", is in the nominative case, showing that he is the subject.[81]\nLatin
  uses morphology to express the distinction between subject and object, whereas English
  uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is
  the rule of inverse word order in questions, which exists in many languages. This
  rule explains why when in English, the phrase \"John is talking to Lucy\" is turned
  into a question, it becomes \"Who is John talking to?\", and not \"John is talking
  to who?\". The latter example may be used as a way of placing special emphasis on
  \"who\", thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes
  the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in
  units, called phrases, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure.
  Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure,
  connecting the phrases to each other at different levels.[82] To the right is a
  graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence \"the cat
  sat on the mat\". The sentence is analyzed as being constituted by a noun phrase,
  a verb, and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided
  into a preposition and a noun phrase, and the noun phrases consist of an article
  and a noun.[83]\nThe reason sentences can be seen as being composed of phrases is
  because each phrase would be moved around as a single element if syntactic operations
  were carried out. For example, \"the cat\" is one phrase, and \"on the mat\" is
  another, because they would be treated as single units if a decision was made to
  emphasize the location by moving forward the prepositional phrase: \"[And] on the
  mat, the cat sat\".[83] There are many different formalist and functionalist frameworks
  that propose theories for describing syntactic structures, based on different assumptions
  about what language is and how it should be described. Each of them would analyze
  a sentence such as this in a different manner.[17]\nTypology and universals[edit]\nMain
  articles: Linguistic typology and Linguistic universal\nLanguages can be classified
  in relation to their grammatical types. Languages that belong to different families
  nonetheless often have features in common, and these shared features tend to correlate.[84]
  For example, languages can be classified on the basis of their basic word order,
  the relative order of the verb, and its constituents in a normal indicative sentence.
  In English, the basic order is SVO: \"The snake(S) bit(V) the man(O)\", whereas
  for example, the corresponding sentence in the Australian language Gamilaraay would
  be d̪uyugu n̪ama d̪ayn yiːy (snake man bit), SOV.[85] Word order type is relevant
  as a typological parameter, because basic word order type corresponds with other
  syntactic parameters, such as the relative order of nouns and adjectives, or of
  the use of prepositions or postpositions. Such correlations are called implicational
  universals.[86] For example, most (but not all) languages that are of the SOV type
  have postpositions rather than prepositions, and have adjectives before nouns.[87]\nAll
  languages structure sentences into Subject, Verb, and Object, but languages differ
  in the way they classify the relations between actors and actions. English uses
  the nominative-accusative word typology: in English transitive clauses, the subjects
  of both intransitive sentences (\"I run\") and transitive sentences (\"I love you\")
  are treated in the same way, shown here by the nominative pronoun I. Some languages,
  called ergative, Gamilaraay among them, distinguish instead between Agents and Patients.
  In ergative languages, the single participant in an intransitive sentence, such
  as \"I run\", is treated the same as the patient in a transitive sentence, giving
  the equivalent of \"me run\" and \"you love me\". Only in transitive sentences would
  the equivalent of the pronoun \"I\" be used.[85] In this way the semantic roles
  can map onto the grammatical relations in different ways, grouping an intransitive
  subject either with Agents (accusative type) or Patients (ergative type) or even
  making each of the three roles differently, which is called the tripartite type.[88]\nThe
  shared features of languages which belong to the same typological class type may
  have arisen completely independently. Their co-occurrence might be due to universal
  laws governing the structure of natural languages, \"language universals\", or they
  might be the result of languages evolving convergent solutions to the recurring
  communicative problems that humans use language to solve.[18]\nSocial contexts of
  use and transmission[edit]\n\n\n\n\nThe Wall of Love in Paris, where the phrase
  \"I love you\" is featured in 250 languages of the world.[89]\n\n\nWhile humans
  have the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an environment
  in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent
  on communities of speakers in which children learn language from their elders and
  peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used
  by those who speak them to communicate and to solve a plethora of social tasks.
  Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes.[18]
  Due to the way in which language is transmitted between generations and within communities,
  language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due
  to language contact. The process is similar to the process of evolution, where the
  process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a phylogenetic tree.[90]\nHowever,
  languages differ from a biological organisms in that they readily incorporate elements
  from other languages through the process of diffusion, as speakers of different
  languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language,
  acquiring their first language or languages as children, or learning new languages
  as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world,
  many small languages are becoming endangered as their speakers shift to other languages
  that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech
  communities.[91]\nUsage and meaning[edit]\nMain article: Pragmatics\nThe semantic
  study of meaning assumes that meaning is located in a relation between signs and
  meanings that are firmly established through social convention. However, semantics
  does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language.
  Rather, when studying the way in which words and signs are used, it is often the
  case that words have different meanings, depending on the social context of use.
  An important example of this is the process called deixis, which describes the way
  in which certain words refer to entities through their relation between a specific
  point in time and space when the word is uttered. Such words are, for example, the
  word, \"I\" (which designates the person speaking), \"now\" (which designates the
  moment of speaking), and \"here\" (which designates the time of speaking). Signs
  also change their meanings over time, as the conventions governing their usage gradually
  change. The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions changes depending
  on context is called pragmatics. Deixis is an important part of the way that we
  use language to point out entities in the world.[92] Pragmatics is concerned with
  the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to
  meaning. For example, in all languages, linguistic expressions can be used not just
  to transmit information, but to perform actions. Certain actions are made only through
  language, but nonetheless have tangible effects, e.g. the act of \"naming\", which
  creates a new name for some entity, or the act of \"pronouncing someone man and
  wife\", which creates a social contract of marriage. These types of acts are called
  speech acts, although they can of course also be carried out through writing or
  hand signing.[93]\nThe form of linguistic expression often does not correspond to
  the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner
  table a person asks, \"Can you reach the salt?\", that is, in fact, not a question
  about the length of the arms of the one being addressed, but a request to pass the
  salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken;
  these kinds of effects of meaning are called conversational implicatures. These
  social rules for which ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain
  situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation to their context
  vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring communicative
  competence in a language.[94]\nLanguage acquisition[edit]\nMain articles: Language
  acquisition, Second-language acquisition, Second language and Language education\nAll
  healthy, normally developing human beings learn to use language. Children acquire
  the language or languages used around them: whichever languages they receive sufficient
  exposure to during childhood. The development is essentially the same for children
  acquiring sign or oral languages.[95] This learning process is referred to as first-language
  acquisition, since unlike many other kinds of learning, it requires no direct teaching
  or specialized study. In The Descent of Man, naturalist Charles Darwin called this
  process \"an instinctive tendency to acquire an art\".[10]\n\n\n\n\nAll normal children
  acquire language if they are exposed to it in their first years of life, even in
  cultures where adults rarely address infants and toddlers directly.\n\n\n\nA lesson
  at Kituwah Academy on the Qualla Boundary in North Carolina, where the Cherokee
  language is the medium of instruction from pre-school on up and students learn it
  as a first language.\n\n\n\nFirst language acquisition proceeds in a fairly regular
  sequence, though there is a wide degree of variation in the timing of particular
  stages among normally developing infants. From birth, newborns respond more readily
  to human speech than to other sounds. Around one month of age, babies appear to
  be able to distinguish between different speech sounds. Around six months of age,
  a child will begin babbling, producing the speech sounds or handshapes of the languages
  used around them. Words appear around the age of 12 to 18 months; the average vocabulary
  of an eighteen-month-old child is around 50 words. A child's first utterances are
  holophrases (literally \"whole-sentences\"), utterances that use just one word to
  communicate some idea. Several months after a child begins producing words, she
  or he will produce two-word utterances, and within a few more months will begin
  to produce telegraphic speech, or short sentences that are less grammatically complex
  than adult speech, but that do show regular syntactic structure. From roughly the
  age of three to five years, a child's ability to speak or sign is refined to the
  point that it resembles adult language.[96][97] Studies published in 2013 have indicated
  that unborn fetuses are capable of language acquisition to some degree.[98][99]\nAcquisition
  of second and additional languages can come at any age, through exposure in daily
  life or courses. Children learning a second language are more likely to achieve
  native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking
  a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference
  between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the
  process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner
  already knows.[100]\nLanguage and culture[edit]\nSee also: Culture and Speech community\n\n\n\n\nArnold
  Lakhovsky, The Conversation (circa 1935)\n\n\nLanguages, understood as the particular
  set of speech norms of a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture
  of the community that speaks them. Languages differ not only in pronunciation, vocabulary,
  and grammar, but also through having different \"cultures of speaking.\" Humans
  use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group as well as
  difference from others. Even among speakers of one language, several different ways
  of using the language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular
  subgroups within a larger culture. Linguists and anthropologists, particularly sociolinguists,
  ethnolinguists, and linguistic anthropologists have specialized in studying how
  ways of speaking vary between speech communities.[101]\nLinguists use the term \"varieties\"
  to refer to the different ways of speaking a language. This term includes geographically
  or socioculturally defined dialects as well as the jargons or styles of subcultures.
  Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style
  as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.[102]\nBecause
  norms for language use are shared by members of a specific group, communicative
  style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic
  differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example,
  speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority
  or social class, one's area of origin, or status as a second language speaker. These
  kinds of differences are not part of the linguistic system, but are an important
  part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.[103]\nHowever,
  many languages also have grammatical conventions that signal the social position
  of the speaker in relation to others through the use of registers that are related
  to social hierarchies or divisions. In many languages, there are stylistic or even
  grammatical differences between the ways men and women speak, between age groups,
  or between social classes, just as some languages employ different words depending
  on who is listening. For example, in the Australian language Dyirbal, a married
  man must use a special set of words to refer to everyday items when speaking in
  the presence of his mother-in-law.[104] Some cultures, for example, have elaborate
  systems of \"social deixis\", or systems of signalling social distance through linguistic
  means.[105] In English, social deixis is shown mostly through distinguishing between
  addressing some people by first name and others by surname, and in titles such as
  \"Mrs.\", \"boy\", \"Doctor\", or \"Your Honor\", but in other languages, such systems
  may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language.
  For instance, in languages of east Asia such as Thai, Burmese, and Javanese, different
  words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or
  lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the
  lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.[105]\nWriting, literacy and
  technology[edit]\nMain articles: Writing and Literacy\n\n\n\n\nAn inscription of
  Swampy Cree using Canadian Aboriginal syllabics, an abugida developed by Christian
  missionaries for Indigenous Canadian languages\n\n\nThroughout history a number
  of different ways of representing language in graphic media have been invented.
  These are called writing systems.\nThe use of writing has made language even more
  useful to humans. It makes it possible to store large amounts of information outside
  of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances
  that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different
  genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities,
  writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one
  spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive
  development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit
  and formal education.[106]\nThe invention of the first writing systems is roughly
  contemporary with the beginning of the Bronze Age in the late 4th millennium BC.
  The Sumerian archaic cuneiform script and the Egyptian hieroglyphs are generally
  considered to be the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral
  proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with the earliest coherent texts
  from about 2600 BC. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent
  invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely
  independently of Sumerian, or was a case of cultural diffusion. A similar debate
  exists for the Chinese script, which developed around 1200 BC. The pre-Columbian
  Mesoamerican writing systems (including among others Olmec and Maya scripts) are
  generally believed to have had independent origins.[68]\nLanguage change[edit]\nMain
  articles: Language change and Grammaticalization\n\n\n\n\nThe first page of the
  poem Beowulf, written in Old English in the early medieval period (800 – 1100 AD).
  Although Old English is the direct ancestor of modern English, it is unintelligible
  to contemporary English speakers.\n\n\nAll languages change as speakers adopt or
  invent new ways of speaking and pass them on to other members of their speech community.
  Language change happens at all levels from the phonological level to the levels
  of vocabulary, morphology, syntax, and discourse. Even though language change is
  often initially evaluated negatively by speakers of the language who often consider
  changes to be \"decay\" or a sign of slipping norms of language usage, it is natural
  and inevitable.[107]\nChanges may affect specific sounds or the entire phonological
  system. Sound change can consist of the replacement of one speech sound or phonetic
  feature by another, the complete loss of the affected sound, or even the introduction
  of a new sound in a place where there previously was none. Sound changes can be
  conditioned in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of
  certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be regular, which means
  that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are
  met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes
  can sometimes be sporadic, affecting only one particular word or a few words, without
  any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a chain shift in which
  the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the Germanic languages
  when the sound change known as Grimm's law affected all the stop consonants in the
  system. The original consonant *bʰ became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous
  *b in turn became /p/, and the previous *p became /f/. The same process applied
  to all stop consonants and explains why Italic languages such as Latin have p in
  words like pater and pisces, whereas Germanic languages, like English, have father
  and fish.[108]\nAnother example is the Great Vowel Shift in English, which is the
  reason that the spelling of English vowels do not correspond well to their current
  pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography
  out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the
  erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and
  shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin
  mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.[109]\nChange
  also happens in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as idioms or
  particular constructions become grammaticalized. This frequently happens when words
  or morphemes erode and the grammatical system is unconsciously rearranged to compensate
  for the lost element. For example, in some varieties of Caribbean Spanish the final
  /s/ has eroded away. Since Standard Spanish uses final /s/ in the morpheme marking
  the second person subject \"you\" in verbs, the Caribbean varieties now have to
  express the second person using the pronoun tú. This means that the sentence \"what's
  your name\" is ¿como te llamas? ['komo te 'jamas] in Standard Spanish, but ['komo
  'tu te 'jama] in Caribbean Spanish. The simple sound change has affected both morphology
  and syntax.[110] Another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual petrification
  of idioms into new grammatical forms, for example, the way the English \"going to\"
  construction lost its aspect of movement and in some varieties of English has almost
  become a full-fledged future tense (e.g. I'm gonna).\nLanguage change may be motivated
  by \"language internal\" factors, such as changes in pronunciation motivated by
  certain sounds being difficult to distinguish aurally or to produce, or through
  patterns of change that cause some rare types of constructions to drift towards
  more common types.[111] Other causes of language change are social, such as when
  certain pronunciations become emblematic of membership in certain groups, such as
  social classes, or with ideologies, and therefore are adopted by those who wish
  to identify with those groups or ideas. In this way, issues of identity and politics
  can have profound effects on language structure.[112]\nLanguage contact[edit]\nMain
  article: language contact\nOne important source of language change is contact and
  resulting diffusion of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs
  when speakers of two or more languages or varieties interact on a regular basis.[113]Multilingualism
  is likely to have been the norm throughout human history and most people in the
  modern world are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the ethno-national
  state, monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small
  islands. But with the ideology that made one people, one state, and one language
  the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout
  the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding
  to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are multilingual and most
  languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.[114]\nWhen speakers
  of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence
  each other. Through sustained language contact over long periods, linguistic traits
  diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different families may converge
  to become more similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact, this
  may lead to the formation of language areas in which unrelated languages share a
  number of linguistic features. A number of such language areas have been documented,
  among them, the Balkan language area, the Mesoamerican language area, and the Ethiopian
  language area. Also, larger areas such as South Asia, Europe, and Southeast Asia
  have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of
  specific areal features.[115][116]\nLanguage contact may also lead to a variety
  of other linguistic phenomena, including language convergence, borrowing, and relexification
  (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In
  situations of extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation
  of new mixed languages that cannot be considered to belong to a single language
  family. One type of mixed language called pidgins occurs when adult speakers of
  two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither
  group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case,
  they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages,
  but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language
  comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in
  both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers,
  but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language.
  But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually
  children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation
  of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure
  and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called
  a creole language. An example of such mixed languages is Tok Pisin, the official
  language of Papua New-Guinea, which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English
  and Austronesian languages; others are Kreyòl ayisyen, the French-based creole language
  spoken in Haiti, and Michif, a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American

  Ethnologue defines a \"living language\" as \"one that has at least one speaker
  for whom it is their first language\". The exact number of known living languages
  varies from 6,000 to 7,000, depending on the precision of one's definition of \"language\",
  and in particular, on how one defines the distinction between languages and dialects.
  As of 2015, Ethnologue cataloged 7,102 living human languages.[119] The Ethnologue
  establishes linguistic groups based on studies of mutual intelligibility, and therefore
  often includes more categories than more conservative classifications. For example,
  the Danish language that most scholars consider a single language with several dialects
  is classified as two distinct languages (Danish and Jutish) by the Ethnologue.[118]\nAccording
  to the Ethnologue, 389 languages (nearly 6%) have more than a million speakers.
  These languages together account for 94% of the world's population, whereas 94%
  of the world's languages account for the remaining 6% of the global population.
  To the right is a table of the world's 10 most spoken languages with population
  estimates from the Ethnologue (2009 figures).[118]\nLanguages and dialects[edit]\nMain
  article: Dialect § Dialect or language\n\n\n\n\nMulti-lingual sign outside the mayor's
  office in Novi Sad, written in the four official languages of the city: Serbian,
  Hungarian, Slovak, and Pannonian Rusyn.\n\n\nThere is no clear distinction between
  a language and a dialect, notwithstanding a famous aphorism attributed to linguist
  Max Weinreich that \"a language is a dialect with an army and navy\".[120] For example,
  national boundaries frequently override linguistic difference in determining whether
  two linguistic varieties are languages or dialects. Cantonese and Mandarin are,
  for example, often classified as \"dialects\" of Chinese, even though they are more
  different from each other than Swedish is from Norwegian. Before the Yugoslav civil
  war, Serbo-Croatian was considered a single language with two dialects, but now
  Croatian and Serbian are considered different languages and employ different writing
  systems. In other words, the distinction may hinge on political considerations as
  much as on cultural differences, distinctive writing systems, or degree of mutual
  intelligibility.[121]\nLanguage families of the world[edit]\nMain articles: Language
  family, Dialectology, Historical linguistics and List of language families\n\n\n\n\nPrincipal
  language families of the world (and in some cases geographic groups of families).
  For greater detail, see Distribution of languages in the world.\n\n\nThe world's
  languages can be grouped into language families consisting of languages that can
  be shown to have common ancestry. Linguists recognize many hundreds of language
  families, although some of them can possibly be grouped into larger units as more
  evidence becomes available and in-depth studies are carried out. At present, there
  are also dozens of language isolates: languages that cannot be shown to be related
  to any other languages in the world. Among them are Basque, spoken in Europe, Zuni
  of New Mexico, Purépecha of Mexico, Ainu of Japan, Burushaski of Pakistan, and many
  others.[122]\nThe language family of the world that has the most speakers is the
  Indo-European languages, spoken by 46% of the world's population.[123] This family
  includes major world languages like English, Spanish, Russian, and Hindustani (Hindi/Urdu).
  The Indo-European family achieved prevalence first during the Eurasian Migration
  Period (c. 400–800 AD)[citation needed], and subsequently through the European colonial
  expansion, which brought the Indo-European languages to a politically and often
  numerically dominant position in the Americas and much of Africa. The Sino-Tibetan
  languages are spoken by 20%[123] of the world's population and include many of the
  languages of East Asia, including Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, and hundreds of smaller
  languages.[124]\nAfrica is home to a large number of language families, the largest
  of which is the Niger-Congo language family, which includes such languages as Swahili,
  Shona, and Yoruba. Speakers of the Niger-Congo languages account for 6.9% of the
  world's population.[123] A similar number of people speak the Afroasiatic languages,
  which include the populous Semitic languages such as Arabic, Hebrew language, and
  the languages of the Sahara region, such as the Berber languages and Hausa.[124]\nThe
  Austronesian languages are spoken by 5.5% of the world's population and stretch
  from Madagascar to maritime Southeast Asia all the way to Oceania.[123] It includes
  such languages as Malagasy, Māori, Samoan, and many of the indigenous languages
  of Indonesia and Taiwan. The Austronesian languages are considered to have originated
  in Taiwan around 3000 BC and spread through the Oceanic region through island-hopping,
  based on an advanced nautical technology. Other populous language families are the
  Dravidian languages of South Asia (among them Kannada Tamil and Telugu), the Turkic
  languages of Central Asia (such as Turkish), the Austroasiatic (among them Khmer),
  and Tai–Kadai languages of Southeast Asia (including Thai).[124]\nThe areas of the
  world in which there is the greatest linguistic diversity, such as the Americas,
  Papua New Guinea, West Africa, and South-Asia, contain hundreds of small language
  families. These areas together account for the majority of the world's languages,
  though not the majority of speakers. In the Americas, some of the largest language
  families include the Quechumaran, Arawak, and Tupi-Guarani families of South America,
  the Uto-Aztecan, Oto-Manguean, and Mayan of Mesoamerica, and the Na-Dene and Algonquian
  language families of North America. In Australia, most indigenous languages belong
  to the Pama-Nyungan family, whereas Papua-New Guinea is home to a large number of
  small families and isolates, as well as a number of Austronesian languages.[122]\nLanguage
  endangerment[edit]\nMain articles: Endangered language, Language loss, Language
  shift and Language death\n\n\n\n\nTogether, the eight countries in red contain more
  than 50% of the world's languages. The areas in blue are the most linguistically
  diverse in the world, and the locations of most of the world's endangered languages.\n\n\nLanguage
  endangerment occurs when a language is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers
  die out or shift to speaking another language. Language loss occurs when the language
  has no more native speakers, and becomes a dead language. If eventually no one speaks
  the language at all, it becomes an extinct language. While languages have always
  gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated
  rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes of globalization and neo-colonialism,
  where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.[125]\nThe more
  commonly spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less
  commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The total number
  of languages in the world is not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors.
  The consensus is that there are between 6,000[126] and 7,000 languages currently
  spoken (as of 2010), and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by
  the year 2100.[125] The top 20 languages, those spoken by more than 50 million speakers
  each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages
  are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.[125]\nThe
  United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) operates
  with five levels of language endangerment: \"safe\", \"vulnerable\" (not spoken
  by children outside the home), \"definitely endangered\" (not spoken by children),
  \"severely endangered\" (only spoken by the oldest generations), and \"critically
  endangered\" (spoken by few members of the oldest generation, often semi-speakers).
  Notwithstanding claims that the world would be better off if most adopted a single
  common lingua franca, such as English or Esperanto, there is a consensus that the
  loss of languages harms the cultural diversity of the world. It is a common belief,
  going back to the biblical narrative of the tower of Babel, that linguistic diversity
  causes political conflict,[27] but this is contradicted by the fact that many of
  the world's major episodes of violence have taken place in situations with low linguistic
  diversity, such as the Yugoslav and American Civil War, or the genocide of Rwanda,
  whereas many of the most stable political units have been highly multilingual.[127]\nMany
  projects aim to prevent or slow this loss by revitalizing endangered languages and
  promoting education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries
  have enacted specific legislation to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous
  speech communities. A minority of linguists have argued that language loss is a
  natural process that should not be counteracted, and that documenting endangered
  languages for posterity is sufficient.[128]\nSee also[edit]\n\n\nLanguage portal\n\n\n\nBook:

  notes[edit]\n\n^ The gorilla Koko reportedly uses as many as 1000 words in American
  Sign Language, and understands 2000 words of spoken English. There are some doubts
  about whether her use of signs is based on complex understanding or simple conditioning;
  Candland (1993).\n^ \"Functional grammar analyzes grammatical structure, as do formal
  and structural grammar; but it also analyzes the entire communicative situation:
  the purpose of the speech event, its participants, its discourse context. Functionalists
  maintain that the communicative situation motivates, constrains, explains, or otherwise
  determines grammatical structure, and that a structural or formal approaches not
  merely limited to an artificially restricted data base, but is inadequate even as
  a structural account. Functional grammar, then, differs from formal and structural
  grammar in that it purports not to model but to explain; and the explanation is
  grounded in the communicative situation\"; Nichols (1984)\n^ The prefixed asterisk

  /* @nomin */\n} );Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of
  communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific
  example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics.Questions
  concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience,
  have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau
  have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held
  that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers
  such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major
  figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure, Noam Chomsky and William C.
  Stokoe.Estimates of the number of languages in the world vary between 5,000 and
  7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on a partly arbitrary distinction between
  languages and dialects. Natural languages are spoken or signed, but any language
  can be encoded into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli –
  for example, in graphic writing, braille, or whistling. This is because human language
  is modality-independent. Depending on philosophical perspectives regarding the definition
  of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, \"language\" may refer
  to the cognitive ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to
  describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances
  that can be produced from those rules. All languages rely on the process of semiosis
  to relate signs to particular meanings. Oral and sign languages contain a phonological
  system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or morphemes,
  and a syntactic system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form
  phrases and utterances.Human language has the properties of productivity, recursivity,
  and displacement, and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex
  structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of animal
  communication. Language is thought to have originated when early hominins started
  gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to
  form a theory of other minds and a shared intentionality.[1][2] This development
  is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many
  linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative
  and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the human
  brain, but especially in Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Humans acquire language through
  social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently when
  they are approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched
  in human culture. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language
  also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group identity, social
  stratification, as well as social grooming and entertainment.Languages evolve and
  diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by
  comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must
  have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages
  that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family. The Indo-European
  family is the most widely spoken and includes English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian,
  and Hindi; the Sino-Tibetan family, which includes Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese,
  and Standard Tibetan; the Afro-Asiatic family, which includes Arabic, Amharic, Somali,
  and Hebrew; the Bantu languages, which include Swahili, Zulu, Shona, and hundreds
  of other languages spoken throughout Africa; and the Malayo-Polynesian languages,
  which include Indonesian, Malay, Tagalog, Malagasy, and hundreds of other languages
  spoken throughout the Pacific. The languages of the Dravidian family that are spoken
  mostly in Southern India include Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. Academic
  consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of
  the 21st century will probably have become extinct by the year 2100.The English
  word language derives ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *dn̥ǵʰwéh₂s \"tongue,
  speech, language\" through Latin lingua, \"language; tongue\", and Old French language.[3]
  The word is sometimes used to refer to codes, ciphers, and other kinds of artificially
  constructed communication systems such as formally defined computer languages used
  for computer programming. Unlike conventional human languages, a formal language
  in this sense is a system of signs for encoding and decoding information. This article
  specifically concerns the properties of natural human language as it is studied
  in the discipline of linguistics.As an object of linguistic study, \"language\"
  has two primary meanings: an abstract concept, and a specific linguistic system,
  e.g. \"French\". The Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, who defined the modern
  discipline of linguistics, first explicitly formulated the distinction using the
  French word langage for language as a concept, langue as a specific instance of
  a language system, and parole for the concrete usage of speech in a particular language.[4]When
  speaking of language as a general concept, definitions can be used which stress
  different aspects of the phenomenon.[5] These definitions also entail different
  approaches and understandings of language, and they inform different and often incompatible
  schools of linguistic theory.[6] Debates about the nature and origin of language
  go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as Gorgias and Plato debated
  the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could
  represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication
  and truth were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible
  because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and
  prior to, language.[7]During the Enlightenment and its debates about human origins,
  it became fashionable to speculate about the origin of language. Thinkers such as
  Rousseau and Herder argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression
  of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical
  expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and Descartes
  held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder
  about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world – asking whether
  language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates
  concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This
  led to the question of whether philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic
  problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the
  creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially
  the study of language, is associated with what has been called the linguistic turn
  and philosophers such as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy. These debates
  about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness
  remain active today.[8]One definition sees language primarily as the mental faculty
  that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and to
  produce and understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of
  language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity
  for language as a unique development of the human brain. Proponents of the view
  that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported
  by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where
  language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages
  may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together
  without a common language; for example, creole languages and spontaneously developed
  sign languages such as Nicaraguan Sign Language. This view, which can be traced
  back to the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely
  innate, for example, in Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar, or American philosopher
  Jerry Fodor's extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied
  in studies of language within a cognitive science framework and in neurolinguistics.[9][10]Another
  definition sees language as a formal system of signs governed by grammatical rules
  of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages
  can be described as closed structural systems consisting of rules that relate particular
  signs to particular meanings.[11] This structuralist view of language was first
  introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure,[12] and his structuralism remains foundational
  for many approaches to language.[13]Some proponents of Saussure's view of language
  have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying
  its basic elements and then by presenting a formal account of the rules according
  to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent
  of such a theory is Noam Chomsky, the originator of the generative theory of grammar,
  who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated
  using transformational grammars.[14] Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate
  feature of the human mind and to constitute the rudiments of what language is.[15]
  By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide
  formal definitions of language are commonly used in formal logic, in formal theories
  of grammar, and in applied computational linguistics.[16][17] In the philosophy
  of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations
  between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as Alfred Tarski,
  Bertrand Russell, and other formal logicians.Yet another definition sees language
  as a system of communication that enables humans to exchange verbal or symbolic
  utterances. This definition stresses the social functions of language and the fact
  that humans use it to express themselves and to manipulate objects in their environment.
  Functional theories of grammar explain grammatical structures by their communicative
  functions, and understand the grammatical structures of language to be the result
  of an adaptive process by which grammar was \"tailored\" to serve the communicative
  needs of its users.[18][19]This view of language is associated with the study of
  language in pragmatic, cognitive, and interactive frameworks, as well as in sociolinguistics
  and linguistic anthropology. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic
  phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are
  employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of linguistic
  typology, or the classification of languages according to structural features, as
  it can be shown that processes of grammaticalization tend to follow trajectories
  that are partly dependent on typology.[17] In the philosophy of language, the view
  of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with
  Wittgenstein's later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as J. L.
  Austin, Paul Grice, John Searle, and W. O. Quine.[20]Human language is unique in
  comparison to other forms of communication, such as those used by non-human animals.
  Communication systems used by other animals such as bees or apes are closed systems
  that consist of a finite, usually very limited, number of possible ideas that can
  be expressed.[21]In contrast, human language is open-ended and productive, meaning
  that it allows humans to produce a vast range of utterances from a finite set of
  elements, and to create new words and sentences. This is possible because human
  language is based on a dual code, in which a finite number of elements which are
  meaningless in themselves (e.g. sounds, letters or gestures) can be combined to
  form a theoretically infinite number of larger units of meaning (words and sentences).[22]
  Furthermore, the symbols and grammatical rules of any particular language are largely
  arbitrary, so that the system can only be acquired through social interaction.[23]
  The known systems of communication used by animals, on the other hand, can only
  express a finite number of utterances that are mostly genetically determined.[24]Several
  species of animals have proved to be able to acquire forms of communication through
  social learning: for instance a bonobo named Kanzi learned to express itself using
  a set of symbolic lexigrams. Similarly, many species of birds and whales learn their
  songs by imitating other members of their species. However, while some animals may
  acquire large numbers of words and symbols,[note 1] none have been able to learn
  as many different signs as are generally known by an average 4 year old human, nor
  have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language.[25]Human
  languages also differ from animal communication systems in that they employ grammatical
  and semantic categories, such as noun and verb, present and past, which may be used
  to express exceedingly complex meanings.[25] Human language is also unique in having
  the property of recursivity: for example, a noun phrase can contain another noun
  phrase (as in \"[[the chimpanzee]'s lips]\") or a clause can contain another clause
  (as in \"[I see [the dog is running]]\").[2] Human language is also the only known
  natural communication system whose adaptability may be referred to as modality independent.
  This means that it can be used not only for communication through one channel or
  medium, but through several. For example, spoken language uses the auditive modality,
  whereas sign languages and writing use the visual modality, and braille writing
  uses the tactile modality.[26]Human language is also unique in being able to refer
  to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events that
  took place in the past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events
  that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called displacement,
  and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication
  of bees that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight),
  the degree to which it is used in human language is also considered unique.[22]Theories
  about the origin of language differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what
  language is. Some theories are based on the idea that language is so complex that
  one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that
  it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors.
  These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is
  that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything
  found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the
  transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based.
  Similarly, theories based on Chomsky's generative view of language see language
  mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist
  theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.[28]The
  only prominent proponent of a discontinuity-based theory of human language origins
  is linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky.[28] Chomsky proposes that \"some random
  mutation took place, maybe after some strange cosmic ray shower, and it reorganized
  the brain, implanting a language organ in an otherwise primate brain.\"[29] Though
  cautioning against taking this story too literally, Chomsky insists that \"it may
  be closer to reality than many other fairy tales that are told about evolutionary
  processes, including language.\"[29]Continuity-based theories are held by a majority
  of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Those who see
  language as being mostly innate, for example psychologist Steven Pinker, hold the
  precedents to be animal cognition,[10] whereas those who see language as a socially
  learned tool of communication, such as psychologist Michael Tomasello, see it as
  having developed from animal communication in primates: either gestural or vocal
  communication to assist in cooperation.[24] Other continuity-based models see language
  as having developed from music, a view already espoused by Rousseau, Herder, Humboldt,
  and Charles Darwin. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist Steven Mithen.[30]Stephen
  Anderson states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000
  years[31] and that:Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally
  find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only once, and that all
  modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can
  no longer be recovered ... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction.[32]Because
  language emerged in the early prehistory of man, its early development has left
  no historical traces, and it is believed that no comparable processes can be observed
  today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example,
  primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language
  must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical
  adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among
  the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are the size of
  the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a larynx capable of advanced sound
  production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.[33]It is mostly
  undisputed that pre-human australopithecines did not have communication systems
  significantly different from those found in great apes in general, but scholarly
  opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of the genus Homo some
  2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like
  systems (proto-language) as early as Homo habilis (2.3 million years ago) while
  others place the development of primitive symbolic communication only with Homo
  erectus (1.8 million years ago) or Homo heidelbergensis (0.6 million years ago),
  and the development of language proper with Anatomically Modern Homo sapiens with
  the Upper Paleolithic revolution less than 100,000 years ago.[34][35]The study of
  language, linguistics, has been developing into a science since the first grammatical
  descriptions of particular languages in India more than 2000 years ago. Modern linguistics
  is a science that concerns itself with all aspects of language, examining it from
  all of the theoretical viewpoints described above.[36]The academic study of language
  is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical
  angles, all of which inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, descriptive
  linguistics examines the grammar of single languages, theoretical linguistics develops
  theories on how best to conceptualize and define the nature of language based on
  data from the various extant human languages, sociolinguistics studies how languages
  are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions
  of language and grammatical description, neurolinguistics studies how language is
  processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, computational
  linguistics builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational
  models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic
  hypotheses, and historical linguistics relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions
  of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language
  families by using the comparative method.[37]The formal study of language is often
  considered to have started in India with Pāṇini, the 5th century BC grammarian who
  formulated 3,959 rules of Sanskrit morphology. However, Sumerian scribes already
  studied the differences between Sumerian and Akkadian grammar around 1900 BC. Subsequent
  grammatical traditions developed in all of the ancient cultures that adopted writing.[38]In
  the 17th century AD, the French Port-Royal Grammarians developed the idea that the
  grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics of thought,
  and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of
  the comparative method by British philologist and expert on ancient India William
  Jones sparked the rise of comparative linguistics.[39] The scientific study of language
  was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by Wilhelm von Humboldt.
  Early in the 20th century, Ferdinand de Saussure introduced the idea of language
  as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between
  them.[12]By introducing a distinction between diachronic and synchronic analyses
  of language, he laid the foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure
  also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental
  in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between syntagm
  and paradigm, and the Langue-parole distinction, distinguishing language as an abstract
  system (langue), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (parole).[40]In
  the 1960s, Noam Chomsky formulated the generative theory of language. According
  to this theory, the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules that
  is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages.
  This set of rules is called Universal Grammar; for Chomsky, describing it is the
  primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the
  grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as
  they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable
  linguistic variability is generated.[41]In opposition to the formal theories of
  the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language
  is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference
  to their functions. Formal theories of grammar seek to define the different elements
  of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal
  rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed
  by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out.[17][note
  2] The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of the concepts
  (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language)
  which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how
  the mind creates meaning through language.[42]Speaking is the default modality for
  language in all cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated
  capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus,
  the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus
  required for acquiring and producing language.[43] The study of the genetic bases
  for human language is at an early stage: the only gene that has definitely been
  implicated in language production is FOXP2, which may cause a kind of congenital
  language disorder if affected by mutations.[44]The brain is the coordinating center
  of all linguistic activity; it controls both the production of linguistic cognition
  and of meaning and the mechanics of speech production. Nonetheless, our knowledge
  of the neurological bases for language is quite limited, though it has advanced
  considerably with the use of modern imaging techniques. The discipline of linguistics
  dedicated to studying the neurological aspects of language is called neurolinguistics.[45]Early
  work in neurolinguistics involved the study of language in people with brain lesions,
  to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists
  in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated
  in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which is located in the
  posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere.
  People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition
  in which there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains
  a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second
  area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant
  hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning
  that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out.[46] They are
  typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently.
  Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency,
  articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex
  grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also
  exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to
  determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect
  the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive
  aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer
  with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have
  difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific
  to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.[47][48]With
  technological advances in the late 20th century, neurolinguists have also incorporated
  non-invasive techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
  electrophysiology to study language processing in individuals without impairments.[45]Spoken
  language relies on human physical ability to produce sound, which is a longitudinal
  wave propagated through the air at a frequency capable of vibrating the ear drum.
  This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs
  consist of the lungs, the voice box (larynx), and the upper vocal tract – the throat,
  the mouth, and the nose. By controlling the different parts of the speech apparatus,
  the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.[49]The sound
  of speech can be analyzed into a combination of segmental and suprasegmental elements.
  The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are
  usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman
  script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment
  and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore
  are distinguished by their distinct sounds which are a result of their different
  articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena
  encompass such elements as stress, phonation type, voice timbre, and prosody or
  intonation, all of which may have effects across multiple segments.[50]Consonants
  and vowel segments combine to form syllables, which in turn combine to form utterances;
  these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations. Acoustically,
  these different segments are characterized by different formant structures, that
  are visible in a spectrogram of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram
  of the formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude peaks
  in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.[50][51]Vowels are those sounds that
  have no audible friction caused by the narrowing or obstruction of some part of
  the upper vocal tract. They vary in quality according to the degree of lip aperture
  and the placement of the tongue within the oral cavity.[50] Vowels are called close
  when the lips are relatively closed, as in the pronunciation of the vowel [i] (English
  \"ee\"), or open when the lips are relatively open, as in the vowel [a] (English
  \"ah\"). If the tongue is located towards the back of the mouth, the quality changes,
  creating vowels such as [u] (English \"oo\"). The quality also changes depending
  on whether the lips are rounded as opposed to unrounded, creating distinctions such
  as that between [i] (unrounded front vowel such as English \"ee\") and [y] (rounded
  front vowel such as German \"ü\").[52]Consonants are those sounds that have audible
  friction or closure at some point within the upper vocal tract. Consonant sounds
  vary by place of articulation, i.e. the place in the vocal tract where the airflow
  is obstructed, commonly at the lips, teeth, alveolar ridge, palate, velum, uvula,
  or glottis. Each place of articulation produces a different set of consonant sounds,
  which are further distinguished by manner of articulation, or the kind of friction,
  whether full closure, in which case the consonant is called occlusive or stop, or
  different degrees of aperture creating fricatives and approximants. Consonants can
  also be either voiced or unvoiced, depending on whether the vocal cords are set
  in vibration by airflow during the production of the sound. Voicing is what separates
  English [s] in bus (unvoiced sibilant) from [z] in buzz (voiced sibilant).[53]Some
  speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve release of air flow through the
  nasal cavity, and these are called nasals or nasalized sounds. Other sounds are
  defined by the way the tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called
  laterals, because the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds
  (called rhotics) that are characterized by how the tongue is positioned relative
  to the air stream.[51]By using these speech organs, humans can produce hundreds
  of distinct sounds: some appear very often in the world's languages, whereas others
  are much more common in certain language families, language areas, or even specific
  to a single language.[54]When described as a system of symbolic communication, language
  is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: signs, meanings, and a code
  connecting signs with their meanings. The study of the process of semiosis, how
  signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called semiotics. Signs
  can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the
  language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs,
  such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted
  by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.[55]Some of the properties
  that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness
  of the linguistic sign, meaning that there is no predictable connection between
  a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, meaning
  that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures
  that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases;
  the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which
  linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that
  can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the
  productivity of the linguistic system, meaning that the finite number of linguistic
  elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.[55]The
  rules by which signs can be combined to form words and phrases are called syntax
  or grammar. The meaning that is connected to individual signs, morphemes, words,
  phrases, and texts is called semantics.[56] The division of language into separate
  but connected systems of sign and meaning goes back to the first linguistic studies
  of de Saussure and is now used in almost all branches of linguistics.[57]Languages
  express meaning by relating a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms
  must be something that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures,
  and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation
  of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs
  can be considered arbitrary, in the sense that the convention is established socially
  and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific
  sign form and its meaning.Thus, languages must have a vocabulary of signs related
  to specific meaning. The English sign \"dog\" denotes, for example, a member of
  the species Canis familiaris. In a language, the array of arbitrary signs connected
  to specific meanings is called the lexicon, and a single sign connected to a meaning
  is called a lexeme. Not all meanings in a language are represented by single words.
  Often, semantic concepts are embedded in the morphology or syntax of the language
  in the form of grammatical categories.[58]All languages contain the semantic structure
  of predication: a structure that predicates a property, state, or action. Traditionally,
  semantics has been understood to be the study of how speakers and interpreters assign
  truth values to statements, so that meaning is understood to be the process by which
  a predicate can be said to be true or false about an entity, e.g. \"[x [is y]]\"
  or \"[x [does y]]\". Recently, this model of semantics has been complemented with
  more dynamic models of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the context
  in which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning. Such models of meaning
  are explored in the field of pragmatics.[58]Depending on modality, language structure
  can be based on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic
  or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to
  construct meaning are studied in phonology.[59] The study of how humans produce
  and perceive vocal sounds is called phonetics.[60] In spoken language, meaning is
  produced when sounds become part of a system in which some sounds can contribute
  to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, only a limited number
  of the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute
  to constructing meaning.[54]Sounds as part of a linguistic system are called phonemes.[61]
  Phonemes are abstract units of sound, defined as the smallest units in a language
  that can serve to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally different
  words, a so-called minimal pair. In English, for example, the words bat [bæt] and
  pat [pʰæt] form a minimal pair, in which the distinction between /b/ and /p/ differentiates
  the two words, which have different meanings. However, each language contrasts sounds
  in different ways. For example, in a language that does not distinguish between
  voiced and unvoiced consonants, the sounds [p] and [b] (if they both occur) could
  be considered a single phoneme, and consequently, the two pronunciations would have
  the same meaning. Similarly, the English language does not distinguish phonemically
  between aspirated and non-aspirated pronunciations of consonants, as many other
  languages do: the unaspirated /p/ in spin [spɪn] and the aspirated /p/ in pin [pʰɪn]
  are considered to be merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme (such
  variants of a single phoneme are called allophones), whereas in Mandarin Chinese,
  the same difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words [pʰá] 'crouch'
  and [pá] 'eight' (the accent above the á means that the vowel is pronounced with
  a high tone).[62]All spoken languages have phonemes of at least two different categories,
  vowels and consonants, that can be combined to form syllables.[50] As well as segments
  such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey
  meaning. Many languages, for example, use stress, pitch, duration, and tone to distinguish
  meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments,
  they are called suprasegmental.[63] Some languages have only a few phonemes, for
  example, Rotokas and Pirahã language with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas
  languages like Taa may have as many as 141 phonemes.[62] In sign languages, the
  equivalent to phonemes (formerly called cheremes) are defined by the basic elements
  of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond
  to manners of articulation in spoken language.[64][65][66]Writing systems represent
  language using visual symbols, which may or may not correspond to the sounds of
  spoken language. The Latin alphabet (and those on which it is based or that have
  been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds,
  so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant
  or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the Inuktitut
  syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In logographic scripts, each sign
  represents an entire word,[67] and will generally bear no relation to the sound
  of that word in spoken language.Because all languages have a very large number of
  words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents
  the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according
  to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system
  is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the
  horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the Arabic
  script), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension
  (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating
  lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction
  and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.[68]In order
  to represent the sounds of the world's languages in writing, linguists have developed
  the International Phonetic Alphabet, designed to represent all of the discrete sounds
  that are known to contribute to meaning in human languages.[69]Grammar is the study
  of how meaningful elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into
  utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved
  around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they are bound
  to other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful
  elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the
  internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure
  of phrases and sentences are called syntax.[70]Grammar can be described as a system
  of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different
  aspects of meaning.[71] Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through
  the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common
  as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the
  grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing
  between their relations to a predicate, the encoding of temporal and spatial relations
  on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction
  between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.[72]Languages
  organize their parts of speech into classes according to their functions and positions
  relative to other parts. All languages, for instance, make a basic distinction between
  a group of words that prototypically denotes things and concepts and a group of
  words that prototypically denotes actions and events. The first group, which includes
  English words such as \"dog\" and \"song\", are usually called nouns. The second,
  which includes \"run\" and \"sing\", are called verbs. Another common category is
  the adjective: words that describe properties or qualities of nouns, such as \"red\"
  or \"big\". Word classes can be \"open\" if new words can continuously be added
  to the class, or relatively \"closed\" if there is a fixed number of words in a
  class. In English, the class of pronouns is closed, whereas the class of adjectives
  is open, since an infinite number of adjectives can be constructed from verbs (e.g.
  \"saddened\") or nouns (e.g. with the -like suffix, as in \"noun-like\"). In other
  languages such as Korean, the situation is the opposite, and new pronouns can be
  constructed, whereas the number of adjectives is fixed.[73]Word classes also carry
  out differing functions in grammar. Prototypically, verbs are used to construct
  predicates, while nouns are used as arguments of predicates. In a sentence such
  as \"Sally runs\", the predicate is \"runs\", because it is the word that predicates
  a specific state about its argument \"Sally\". Some verbs such as \"curse\" can
  take two arguments, e.g. \"Sally cursed John\". A predicate that can only take a
  single argument is called intransitive, while a predicate that can take two arguments
  is called transitive.[74]Many other word classes exist in different languages, such
  as conjunctions like \"and\" that serve to join two sentences, articles that introduce
  a noun, interjections such as \"wow!\", or ideophones like \"splash\" that mimic
  the sound of some event. Some languages have positionals that describe the spatial
  position of an event or entity. Many languages have classifiers that identify countable
  nouns as belonging to a particular type or having a particular shape. For instance,
  in Japanese, the general noun classifier for humans is nin (人), and it is used for
  counting humans, whatever they are called:[75]For trees, it would be:In linguistics,
  the study of the internal structure of complex words and the processes by which
  words are formed is called morphology. In most languages, it is possible to construct
  complex words that are built of several morphemes. For instance, the English word
  \"unexpected\" can be analyzed as being composed of the three morphemes \"un-\",
  \"expect\" and \"-ed\".[76]Morphemes can be classified according to whether they
  are independent morphemes, so-called roots, or whether they can only co-occur attached
  to other morphemes. These bound morphemes or affixes can be classified according
  to their position in relation to the root: prefixes precede the root, suffixes follow
  the root, and infixes are inserted in the middle of a root. Affixes serve to modify
  or elaborate the meaning of the root. Some languages change the meaning of words
  by changing the phonological structure of a word, for example, the English word
  \"run\", which in the past tense is \"ran\". This process is called ablaut. Furthermore,
  morphology distinguishes between the process of inflection, which modifies or elaborates
  on a word, and the process of derivation, which creates a new word from an existing
  one. In English, the verb \"sing\" has the inflectional forms \"singing\" and \"sung\",
  which are both verbs, and the derivational form \"singer\", which is a noun derived
  from the verb with the agentive suffix \"-er\".[77]Languages differ widely in how
  much they rely on morphological processes of word formation. In some languages,
  for example, Chinese, there are no morphological processes, and all grammatical
  information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type
  of morpho-syntax is often called isolating, or analytic, because there is almost
  a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most
  languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in the degree
  to which morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European
  languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed
  into smaller segments. For example, in Latin, the word bonus, or \"good\", consists
  of the root bon-, meaning \"good\", and the suffix -us, which indicates masculine
  gender, singular number, and nominative case. These languages are called fusional
  languages, because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite
  of fusional languages are agglutinative languages which construct words by stringing
  morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit.
  An example of such a language is Turkish, where for example, the word evlerinizden,
  or \"from your houses\", consists of the morphemes, ev-ler-iniz-den with the meanings
  house-plural-your-from. The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent
  are traditionally called polysynthetic languages. They may express the equivalent
  of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example, in Persian the single
  word nafahmidamesh means I didn't understand it consisting of morphemes na-fahm-id-am-esh
  with the meanings, \"negation.understand.past.I.it\". As another example with more
  complexity, in the Yupik word tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq, which means \"He had
  not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer\", the word consists of the
  morphemes tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq with the meanings, \"reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative\",
  and except for the morpheme tuntu (\"reindeer\") none of the other morphemes can
  appear in isolation.[78]Many languages use morphology to cross-reference words within
  a sentence. This is sometimes called agreement. For example, in many Indo-European
  languages, adjectives must cross-reference the noun they modify in terms of number,
  case, and gender, so that the Latin adjective bonus, or \"good\", is inflected to
  agree with a noun that is masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case.
  In many polysynthetic languages, verbs cross-reference their subjects and objects.
  In these types of languages, a single verb may include information that would require
  an entire sentence in English. For example, in the Basque phrase ikusi nauzu, or
  \"you saw me\", the past tense auxiliary verb n-au-zu (similar to English \"do\")
  agrees with both the subject (you) expressed by the n- prefix, and with the object
  (me) expressed by the -zu suffix. The sentence could be directly transliterated
  as \"see you-did-me\"[79]Another way in which languages convey meaning is through
  the order of words within a sentence. The grammatical rules for how to produce new
  sentences from words that are already known is called syntax. The syntactical rules
  of a language determine why a sentence in English such as \"I love you\" is meaningful,
  but \"*love you I\" is not.[note 3] Syntactical rules determine how word order and
  sentence structure is constrained, and how those constraints contribute to meaning.[80]
  For example, in English, the two sentences \"the slaves were cursing the master\"
  and \"the master was cursing the slaves\" mean different things, because the role
  of the grammatical subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the verb, and
  the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb. Conversely,
  in Latin, both Dominus servos vituperabat and Servos vituperabat dominus mean \"the
  master was reprimanding the slaves\", because servos, or \"slaves\", is in the accusative
  case, showing that they are the grammatical object of the sentence, and dominus,
  or \"master\", is in the nominative case, showing that he is the subject.[81]Latin
  uses morphology to express the distinction between subject and object, whereas English
  uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is
  the rule of inverse word order in questions, which exists in many languages. This
  rule explains why when in English, the phrase \"John is talking to Lucy\" is turned
  into a question, it becomes \"Who is John talking to?\", and not \"John is talking
  to who?\". The latter example may be used as a way of placing special emphasis on
  \"who\", thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes
  the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in
  units, called phrases, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure.
  Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure,
  connecting the phrases to each other at different levels.[82] To the right is a
  graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence \"the cat
  sat on the mat\". The sentence is analyzed as being constituted by a noun phrase,
  a verb, and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided
  into a preposition and a noun phrase, and the noun phrases consist of an article
  and a noun.[83]The reason sentences can be seen as being composed of phrases is
  because each phrase would be moved around as a single element if syntactic operations
  were carried out. For example, \"the cat\" is one phrase, and \"on the mat\" is
  another, because they would be treated as single units if a decision was made to
  emphasize the location by moving forward the prepositional phrase: \"[And] on the
  mat, the cat sat\".[83] There are many different formalist and functionalist frameworks
  that propose theories for describing syntactic structures, based on different assumptions
  about what language is and how it should be described. Each of them would analyze
  a sentence such as this in a different manner.[17]Languages can be classified in
  relation to their grammatical types. Languages that belong to different families
  nonetheless often have features in common, and these shared features tend to correlate.[84]
  For example, languages can be classified on the basis of their basic word order,
  the relative order of the verb, and its constituents in a normal indicative sentence.
  In English, the basic order is SVO: \"The snake(S) bit(V) the man(O)\", whereas
  for example, the corresponding sentence in the Australian language Gamilaraay would
  be d̪uyugu n̪ama d̪ayn yiːy (snake man bit), SOV.[85] Word order type is relevant
  as a typological parameter, because basic word order type corresponds with other
  syntactic parameters, such as the relative order of nouns and adjectives, or of
  the use of prepositions or postpositions. Such correlations are called implicational
  universals.[86] For example, most (but not all) languages that are of the SOV type
  have postpositions rather than prepositions, and have adjectives before nouns.[87]All
  languages structure sentences into Subject, Verb, and Object, but languages differ
  in the way they classify the relations between actors and actions. English uses
  the nominative-accusative word typology: in English transitive clauses, the subjects
  of both intransitive sentences (\"I run\") and transitive sentences (\"I love you\")
  are treated in the same way, shown here by the nominative pronoun I. Some languages,
  called ergative, Gamilaraay among them, distinguish instead between Agents and Patients.
  In ergative languages, the single participant in an intransitive sentence, such
  as \"I run\", is treated the same as the patient in a transitive sentence, giving
  the equivalent of \"me run\" and \"you love me\". Only in transitive sentences would
  the equivalent of the pronoun \"I\" be used.[85] In this way the semantic roles
  can map onto the grammatical relations in different ways, grouping an intransitive
  subject either with Agents (accusative type) or Patients (ergative type) or even
  making each of the three roles differently, which is called the tripartite type.[88]The
  shared features of languages which belong to the same typological class type may
  have arisen completely independently. Their co-occurrence might be due to universal
  laws governing the structure of natural languages, \"language universals\", or they
  might be the result of languages evolving convergent solutions to the recurring
  communicative problems that humans use language to solve.[18]While humans have the
  ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an environment
  in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent
  on communities of speakers in which children learn language from their elders and
  peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used
  by those who speak them to communicate and to solve a plethora of social tasks.
  Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes.[18]
  Due to the way in which language is transmitted between generations and within communities,
  language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due
  to language contact. The process is similar to the process of evolution, where the
  process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a phylogenetic tree.[90]However,
  languages differ from a biological organisms in that they readily incorporate elements
  from other languages through the process of diffusion, as speakers of different
  languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language,
  acquiring their first language or languages as children, or learning new languages
  as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world,
  many small languages are becoming endangered as their speakers shift to other languages
  that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech
  communities.[91]The semantic study of meaning assumes that meaning is located in
  a relation between signs and meanings that are firmly established through social
  convention. However, semantics does not study the way in which social conventions
  are made and affect language. Rather, when studying the way in which words and signs
  are used, it is often the case that words have different meanings, depending on
  the social context of use. An important example of this is the process called deixis,
  which describes the way in which certain words refer to entities through their relation
  between a specific point in time and space when the word is uttered. Such words
  are, for example, the word, \"I\" (which designates the person speaking), \"now\"
  (which designates the moment of speaking), and \"here\" (which designates the time
  of speaking). Signs also change their meanings over time, as the conventions governing
  their usage gradually change. The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions
  changes depending on context is called pragmatics. Deixis is an important part of
  the way that we use language to point out entities in the world.[92] Pragmatics
  is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns
  contribute to meaning. For example, in all languages, linguistic expressions can
  be used not just to transmit information, but to perform actions. Certain actions
  are made only through language, but nonetheless have tangible effects, e.g. the
  act of \"naming\", which creates a new name for some entity, or the act of \"pronouncing
  someone man and wife\", which creates a social contract of marriage. These types
  of acts are called speech acts, although they can of course also be carried out
  through writing or hand signing.[93]The form of linguistic expression often does
  not correspond to the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example,
  if at a dinner table a person asks, \"Can you reach the salt?\", that is, in fact,
  not a question about the length of the arms of the one being addressed, but a request
  to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which
  it is spoken; these kinds of effects of meaning are called conversational implicatures.
  These social rules for which ways of using language are considered appropriate in
  certain situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation to their
  context vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring
  communicative competence in a language.[94]All healthy, normally developing human
  beings learn to use language. Children acquire the language or languages used around
  them: whichever languages they receive sufficient exposure to during childhood.
  The development is essentially the same for children acquiring sign or oral languages.[95]
  This learning process is referred to as first-language acquisition, since unlike
  many other kinds of learning, it requires no direct teaching or specialized study.
  In The Descent of Man, naturalist Charles Darwin called this process \"an instinctive
  tendency to acquire an art\".[10]First language acquisition proceeds in a fairly
  regular sequence, though there is a wide degree of variation in the timing of particular
  stages among normally developing infants. From birth, newborns respond more readily
  to human speech than to other sounds. Around one month of age, babies appear to
  be able to distinguish between different speech sounds. Around six months of age,
  a child will begin babbling, producing the speech sounds or handshapes of the languages
  used around them. Words appear around the age of 12 to 18 months; the average vocabulary
  of an eighteen-month-old child is around 50 words. A child's first utterances are
  holophrases (literally \"whole-sentences\"), utterances that use just one word to
  communicate some idea. Several months after a child begins producing words, she
  or he will produce two-word utterances, and within a few more months will begin
  to produce telegraphic speech, or short sentences that are less grammatically complex
  than adult speech, but that do show regular syntactic structure. From roughly the
  age of three to five years, a child's ability to speak or sign is refined to the
  point that it resembles adult language.[96][97] Studies published in 2013 have indicated
  that unborn fetuses are capable of language acquisition to some degree.[98][99]Acquisition
  of second and additional languages can come at any age, through exposure in daily
  life or courses. Children learning a second language are more likely to achieve
  native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking
  a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference
  between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the
  process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner
  already knows.[100]Languages, understood as the particular set of speech norms of
  a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that
  speaks them. Languages differ not only in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar,
  but also through having different \"cultures of speaking.\" Humans use language
  as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group as well as difference from
  others. Even among speakers of one language, several different ways of using the
  language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups
  within a larger culture. Linguists and anthropologists, particularly sociolinguists,
  ethnolinguists, and linguistic anthropologists have specialized in studying how
  ways of speaking vary between speech communities.[101]Linguists use the term \"varieties\"
  to refer to the different ways of speaking a language. This term includes geographically
  or socioculturally defined dialects as well as the jargons or styles of subcultures.
  Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style
  as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.[102]Because
  norms for language use are shared by members of a specific group, communicative
  style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic
  differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example,
  speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority
  or social class, one's area of origin, or status as a second language speaker. These
  kinds of differences are not part of the linguistic system, but are an important
  part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.[103]However,
  many languages also have grammatical conventions that signal the social position
  of the speaker in relation to others through the use of registers that are related
  to social hierarchies or divisions. In many languages, there are stylistic or even
  grammatical differences between the ways men and women speak, between age groups,
  or between social classes, just as some languages employ different words depending
  on who is listening. For example, in the Australian language Dyirbal, a married
  man must use a special set of words to refer to everyday items when speaking in
  the presence of his mother-in-law.[104] Some cultures, for example, have elaborate
  systems of \"social deixis\", or systems of signalling social distance through linguistic
  means.[105] In English, social deixis is shown mostly through distinguishing between
  addressing some people by first name and others by surname, and in titles such as
  \"Mrs.\", \"boy\", \"Doctor\", or \"Your Honor\", but in other languages, such systems
  may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language.
  For instance, in languages of east Asia such as Thai, Burmese, and Javanese, different
  words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or
  lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the
  lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.[105]Throughout history a
  number of different ways of representing language in graphic media have been invented.
  These are called writing systems.The use of writing has made language even more
  useful to humans. It makes it possible to store large amounts of information outside
  of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances
  that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different
  genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities,
  writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one
  spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive
  development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit
  and formal education.[106]The invention of the first writing systems is roughly
  contemporary with the beginning of the Bronze Age in the late 4th millennium BC.
  The Sumerian archaic cuneiform script and the Egyptian hieroglyphs are generally
  considered to be the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral
  proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with the earliest coherent texts
  from about 2600 BC. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent
  invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely
  independently of Sumerian, or was a case of cultural diffusion. A similar debate
  exists for the Chinese script, which developed around 1200 BC. The pre-Columbian
  Mesoamerican writing systems (including among others Olmec and Maya scripts) are
  generally believed to have had independent origins.[68]All languages change as speakers
  adopt or invent new ways of speaking and pass them on to other members of their
  speech community. Language change happens at all levels from the phonological level
  to the levels of vocabulary, morphology, syntax, and discourse. Even though language
  change is often initially evaluated negatively by speakers of the language who often
  consider changes to be \"decay\" or a sign of slipping norms of language usage,
  it is natural and inevitable.[107]Changes may affect specific sounds or the entire
  phonological system. Sound change can consist of the replacement of one speech sound
  or phonetic feature by another, the complete loss of the affected sound, or even
  the introduction of a new sound in a place where there previously was none. Sound
  changes can be conditioned in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in
  the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be regular,
  which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions
  are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound
  changes can sometimes be sporadic, affecting only one particular word or a few words,
  without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a chain shift
  in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the Germanic
  languages when the sound change known as Grimm's law affected all the stop consonants
  in the system. The original consonant *bʰ became /b/ in the Germanic languages,
  the previous *b in turn became /p/, and the previous *p became /f/. The same process
  applied to all stop consonants and explains why Italic languages such as Latin have
  p in words like pater and pisces, whereas Germanic languages, like English, have
  father and fish.[108]Another example is the Great Vowel Shift in English, which
  is the reason that the spelling of English vowels do not correspond well to their
  current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established
  orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change
  is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct
  and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused
  Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.[109]Change
  also happens in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as idioms or
  particular constructions become grammaticalized. This frequently happens when words
  or morphemes erode and the grammatical system is unconsciously rearranged to compensate
  for the lost element. For example, in some varieties of Caribbean Spanish the final
  /s/ has eroded away. Since Standard Spanish uses final /s/ in the morpheme marking
  the second person subject \"you\" in verbs, the Caribbean varieties now have to
  express the second person using the pronoun tú. This means that the sentence \"what's
  your name\" is ¿como te llamas? ['komo te 'jamas] in Standard Spanish, but ['komo
  'tu te 'jama] in Caribbean Spanish. The simple sound change has affected both morphology
  and syntax.[110] Another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual petrification
  of idioms into new grammatical forms, for example, the way the English \"going to\"
  construction lost its aspect of movement and in some varieties of English has almost
  become a full-fledged future tense (e.g. I'm gonna).Language change may be motivated
  by \"language internal\" factors, such as changes in pronunciation motivated by
  certain sounds being difficult to distinguish aurally or to produce, or through
  patterns of change that cause some rare types of constructions to drift towards
  more common types.[111] Other causes of language change are social, such as when
  certain pronunciations become emblematic of membership in certain groups, such as
  social classes, or with ideologies, and therefore are adopted by those who wish
  to identify with those groups or ideas. In this way, issues of identity and politics
  can have profound effects on language structure.[112]One important source of language
  change is contact and resulting diffusion of linguistic traits between languages.
  Language contact occurs when speakers of two or more languages or varieties interact
  on a regular basis.[113]Multilingualism is likely to have been the norm throughout
  human history and most people in the modern world are multilingual. Before the rise
  of the concept of the ethno-national state, monolingualism was characteristic mainly
  of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the ideology that made one people,
  one state, and one language the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism
  started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries
  in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries
  are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other
  languages.[114]When speakers of different languages interact closely, it is typical
  for their languages to influence each other. Through sustained language contact
  over long periods, linguistic traits diffuse between languages, and languages belonging
  to different families may converge to become more similar. In areas where many languages
  are in close contact, this may lead to the formation of language areas in which
  unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A number of such language
  areas have been documented, among them, the Balkan language area, the Mesoamerican
  language area, and the Ethiopian language area. Also, larger areas such as South
  Asia, Europe, and Southeast Asia have sometimes been considered language areas,
  because of widespread diffusion of specific areal features.[115][116]Language contact
  may also lead to a variety of other linguistic phenomena, including language convergence,
  borrowing, and relexification (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with
  that of another language). In situations of extreme and sustained language contact,
  it may lead to the formation of new mixed languages that cannot be considered to
  belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called pidgins occurs
  when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but
  in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group
  fluently. In such a case, they will often construct a communication form that has
  traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological
  structure. The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological
  categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having
  any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as
  their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech
  community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first
  language. As the generation of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be
  seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type
  of language is generally called a creole language. An example of such mixed languages
  is Tok Pisin, the official language of Papua New-Guinea, which originally arose
  as a Pidgin based on English and Austronesian languages; others are Kreyòl ayisyen,
  the French-based creole language spoken in Haiti, and Michif, a mixed language of
  Canada, based on the Native American language Cree and French.[117]SIL Ethnologue
  defines a \"living language\" as \"one that has at least one speaker for whom it
  is their first language\". The exact number of known living languages varies from
  6,000 to 7,000, depending on the precision of one's definition of \"language\",
  and in particular, on how one defines the distinction between languages and dialects.
  As of 2015, Ethnologue cataloged 7,102 living human languages.[119] The Ethnologue
  establishes linguistic groups based on studies of mutual intelligibility, and therefore
  often includes more categories than more conservative classifications. For example,
  the Danish language that most scholars consider a single language with several dialects
  is classified as two distinct languages (Danish and Jutish) by the Ethnologue.[118]According
  to the Ethnologue, 389 languages (nearly 6%) have more than a million speakers.
  These languages together account for 94% of the world's population, whereas 94%
  of the world's languages account for the remaining 6% of the global population.
  To the right is a table of the world's 10 most spoken languages with population
  estimates from the Ethnologue (2009 figures).[118]There is no clear distinction
  between a language and a dialect, notwithstanding a famous aphorism attributed to
  linguist Max Weinreich that \"a language is a dialect with an army and navy\".[120]
  For example, national boundaries frequently override linguistic difference in determining
  whether two linguistic varieties are languages or dialects. Cantonese and Mandarin
  are, for example, often classified as \"dialects\" of Chinese, even though they
  are more different from each other than Swedish is from Norwegian. Before the Yugoslav
  civil war, Serbo-Croatian was considered a single language with two dialects, but
  now Croatian and Serbian are considered different languages and employ different
  writing systems. In other words, the distinction may hinge on political considerations
  as much as on cultural differences, distinctive writing systems, or degree of mutual
  intelligibility.[121]The world's languages can be grouped into language families
  consisting of languages that can be shown to have common ancestry. Linguists recognize
  many hundreds of language families, although some of them can possibly be grouped
  into larger units as more evidence becomes available and in-depth studies are carried
  out. At present, there are also dozens of language isolates: languages that cannot
  be shown to be related to any other languages in the world. Among them are Basque,
  spoken in Europe, Zuni of New Mexico, Purépecha of Mexico, Ainu of Japan, Burushaski
  of Pakistan, and many others.[122]The language family of the world that has the
  most speakers is the Indo-European languages, spoken by 46% of the world's population.[123]
  This family includes major world languages like English, Spanish, Russian, and Hindustani
  (Hindi/Urdu). The Indo-European family achieved prevalence first during the Eurasian
  Migration Period (c. 400–800 AD)[citation needed], and subsequently through the
  European colonial expansion, which brought the Indo-European languages to a politically
  and often numerically dominant position in the Americas and much of Africa. The
  Sino-Tibetan languages are spoken by 20%[123] of the world's population and include
  many of the languages of East Asia, including Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, and hundreds
  of smaller languages.[124]Africa is home to a large number of language families,
  the largest of which is the Niger-Congo language family, which includes such languages
  as Swahili, Shona, and Yoruba. Speakers of the Niger-Congo languages account for
  6.9% of the world's population.[123] A similar number of people speak the Afroasiatic
  languages, which include the populous Semitic languages such as Arabic, Hebrew language,
  and the languages of the Sahara region, such as the Berber languages and Hausa.[124]The
  Austronesian languages are spoken by 5.5% of the world's population and stretch
  from Madagascar to maritime Southeast Asia all the way to Oceania.[123] It includes
  such languages as Malagasy, Māori, Samoan, and many of the indigenous languages
  of Indonesia and Taiwan. The Austronesian languages are considered to have originated
  in Taiwan around 3000 BC and spread through the Oceanic region through island-hopping,
  based on an advanced nautical technology. Other populous language families are the
  Dravidian languages of South Asia (among them Kannada Tamil and Telugu), the Turkic
  languages of Central Asia (such as Turkish), the Austroasiatic (among them Khmer),
  and Tai–Kadai languages of Southeast Asia (including Thai).[124]The areas of the
  world in which there is the greatest linguistic diversity, such as the Americas,
  Papua New Guinea, West Africa, and South-Asia, contain hundreds of small language
  families. These areas together account for the majority of the world's languages,
  though not the majority of speakers. In the Americas, some of the largest language
  families include the Quechumaran, Arawak, and Tupi-Guarani families of South America,
  the Uto-Aztecan, Oto-Manguean, and Mayan of Mesoamerica, and the Na-Dene and Algonquian
  language families of North America. In Australia, most indigenous languages belong
  to the Pama-Nyungan family, whereas Papua-New Guinea is home to a large number of
  small families and isolates, as well as a number of Austronesian languages.[122]Language
  endangerment occurs when a language is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers
  die out or shift to speaking another language. Language loss occurs when the language
  has no more native speakers, and becomes a dead language. If eventually no one speaks
  the language at all, it becomes an extinct language. While languages have always
  gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated
  rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes of globalization and neo-colonialism,
  where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.[125]The more
  commonly spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less
  commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The total number
  of languages in the world is not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors.
  The consensus is that there are between 6,000[126] and 7,000 languages currently
  spoken (as of 2010), and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by
  the year 2100.[125] The top 20 languages, those spoken by more than 50 million speakers
  each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages
  are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.[125]The
  United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) operates
  with five levels of language endangerment: \"safe\", \"vulnerable\" (not spoken
  by children outside the home), \"definitely endangered\" (not spoken by children),
  \"severely endangered\" (only spoken by the oldest generations), and \"critically
  endangered\" (spoken by few members of the oldest generation, often semi-speakers).
  Notwithstanding claims that the world would be better off if most adopted a single
  common lingua franca, such as English or Esperanto, there is a consensus that the
  loss of languages harms the cultural diversity of the world. It is a common belief,
  going back to the biblical narrative of the tower of Babel, that linguistic diversity
  causes political conflict,[27] but this is contradicted by the fact that many of
  the world's major episodes of violence have taken place in situations with low linguistic
  diversity, such as the Yugoslav and American Civil War, or the genocide of Rwanda,
  whereas many of the most stable political units have been highly multilingual.[127]Many
  projects aim to prevent or slow this loss by revitalizing endangered languages and
  promoting education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries
  have enacted specific legislation to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous
  speech communities. A minority of linguists have argued that language loss is a
  natural process that should not be counteracted, and that documenting endangered
  languages for posterity is sufficient.[128]"
