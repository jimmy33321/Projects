  Best Cash Back Card :Â Blue Cash Preferred Card from American ExpressThe winner of our cash back card analysis, Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express (a NextAdvisor advertiser) combines excellent cash back rewards with a generous 15-month 0% APR period. You’ll earn 6% cash back at supermarkets (on up to $6K in purchases annually), 3% at gas stations and select department stores like Sears, JCP, Kohls, Nordstrom and Macy’s, and 1% cash back on all your other purchases. Plus, there’s a $150 bonusÂ after spending $1,000 in the first 3 months – pretty easy to earn if you use your card like a typical consumer. On top of this you can take advantage of its 0% intro APR for the first 15 months on purchases and balance transfers (although there is a 3% balance transfer fee). I really like this card because of its huge cash back potential. Anyone who spends a lot on groceries and gas can really rack up the cash back rewards. And you don’t have to sign up quarterly to get your cash back – it’s automatic. There is a $75 annual fee, which can be off-putting to some, but honestly if you use your card like a typical consumer you should more than earn this back. If you prefer a card with no annual fee, generous and straightforward cash back rewards (effective 2% cash back on everything!) and a 15-month 0% intro APR period, check out the Citi Double Cash Card. Or to find out which cash back card is the best for your spending patterns, use our free Personalized Cash Back Calculator.

  Best Balance Transfer Card: ChaseÂ Slate
- |2+

- |
  If you overdid it on some shopping purchases and can’t fully pay off your balance on one or more credit cards, ChaseÂ Slate is the card for you.Â  Instead of starting to rack up huge interest fees, you can transfer your balances to the Chase Slate. With a 15-month 0% intro APR on balance transfers and purchases, as well as no balance transfer fees and no annual fee, this card can save you a ton in interest payments. It’s the only card we’ve found that offers both no balance transfer fee and a lengthy 0% intro APR. And unlike other cards with stellar features like these, people with merely good credit (often viewed as a credit score above 660) have a chance to be approved for this card. Note that the $0 balance transfer fee is only available for the first 60 days, but since the reason most people get this card is to transfer their balances immediately that shouldn’t be an issue.Â  If you’re in the market for a balance-transfer card and aren’t sure which one is best for your situation, take a look at our free Balance Transfer CalculatorÂ to determine which card will save you the most.

  Best Low APR Card:Â Citi Simplicity
- |
  Leading the pack with an outstanding 21-month 0% intro APR (the longest we’ve found) and no annual fee or late fees, Citi Simplicity will carry you well into 2017 interest-free. You’ll enjoy a 0% intro APR period for 21 months (that’s over 1.5 years!) on both purchases and balance transfers. Plus you won’t pay late fees, penalty rates or an annual fee. Although we encourage our readers to pay their cards on time to maintain a healthy credit score, having no late fees and no penalty rates is a huge bonus for anyone who may be late with a payment every now and then.Â Now is the time to get this card, as any purchases you make will be interest-free until 2017. This extended 0% APR period will allow you to pay down your balance over time without costing you anything in interest fees. Note this card does have a 3% balance transfer fee.

  Best Travel Card:Â Capital One Venture Rewards Card
- |2+

- |
  If you’re saving up for that big vacation or are just a frequent traveler, you should strongly consider the Capital One Venture Rewards Card. It starts off with a 40,000 point bonus – equal to $400 in travel – after you spend $3,000 in the first 90 days. Plus you’ll earn 2 miles for every dollar you spend. That’s 2x miles onÂ everyÂ purchase, not just in certain categories or on special deals you have to sign up for quarterly. Â Using your earned miles is easy too- just book your travel and then redeem your miles as a statement credit against your travel costs. You can travel however and wherever you’d like; on any airline, at any hotel and with any rental car company (or cruise!). You can also make your travel plans however you would like; online, with a travel agent or over the phone. The bottom line is that you just need to pay for the travel with this card, it’s as simple as that.
- |
  The Capital One Venture Rewards CardÂ had a very high reward value of $2.00 for every $100 spent in both the flight and hotel categories in ourÂ Travel Rewards Credit Card Analysis. This high value means that your miles are worth more than with other popular travel cards on the market today. And an added perk is that when you travel outside the U.S. you won’t have to pay foreign transaction fees and it hasÂ chip and signature technology. The card does have a $59 annual fee, but it’s waived the first year so you’ll have a year to determine if this card is right for you before having to pay an annual charge. As an added bonus, the cardÂ was designed for people with good to excellent credit, making it a little more accessible than cards that require excellent credit.

  Best Card for Anyone with Good (but not Great) Credit: Chase Freedom
- |
  If you’re in the market for a credit card but don’t necessarily have terrific credit, Chase Freedom might be right up your alley. It was developed for those with “Good” credit, which is typically considered to be a credit score between 660 and 724 on the FICO credit score scale (if you don’t know your credit score you can get it for free). The card doesn’t skimp on extras either – to start with you’ll get an enormous $150 intro bonus after spending just $500 in the first 3 months. You’ll also earn 5% cash back on up to $1,500 in purchases in categories that rotate quarterly (note: you need to register each quarter to receive this cash back), and 1% back on everything else you buy. Plus there’s no annual fee to worry about paying. We really like this card because it has the great features that cards typically oriented towards consumers with great credit do, but it’s available to those who might have a hit or two on the credit report.
- |
  Best Card for Students: Discover it for Students
- |
  Offering both cash back rewards and a 0% intro APR,Â Discover it for Students hits the mark for the college-bound. First off, you’ll earn 5% cash back on up to $1,500 in purchases in categories that rotate quarterly and 1% cash back on all other purchases. You will need to register online quarterly to receive the 5% back, but it’s worth it. Plus, you can take advantage of a 6-month 0% intro APR on your purchases. That means you’ll pay no interest at all for the first 6 months you have this card. We’re not encouraging student debt, but it’s nice to know if you put a gift or two and some textbooks on your card you’ll have 6 months to pay for them without owing any interest. Just make sure you practice responsible use of your card and you’ll be able to build a credit history and boost your credit score. And did we mention there is no annual fee AND no foreign transaction fees? So if you travel outside the U.S. you won’t pay any additional fees to use your card, which can save you a ton of money. Overall this is a great card for any college (or grad school) student that combines strong rewards with a 0% intro APR on purchases and very reasonable ongoing interest rate.

  Best Card for Businesses: Ink Cash Business Card
- |
  Ink Cash Business Card is a terrific pick for business. It serves up some great business-oriented features including generous cash back rewards, a 0% intro APR and no annual fee. Plus there’s a $200 bonus after spending $3,000 in the first 3 months. In addition you’ll earn 5% cash back on purchases at office supply stores and on landline, cellular phone, internet and cable TV services (on up to $25,000 in combined purchases). You’ll also get 2% cash back on the first $25,000 in combined purchases at restaurants and gas stations and an unlimited 1% cash back on all other purchases. Â On the downside, the 5% and 2% cash back rewards are issued annually on your account anniversary, but the 1% cash back rewards are issued monthly. The 12-month 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers can be very helpful to new businesses looking to make some big purchases they don’t need to pay off for a year, or to mature businesses who just want to take advantage of paying no interest on their purchases and balance transfers for a year.

        For the person who has to wait for a chip … let me see it has nothing to do with you.   Its really between the store and the credit card co.    You have to check into the credit card co before you apply for one.  American Express has one if you spend 1,000.00 in three months you get 300.00 back.  Let me see, is that good, and no yearly charge.  With out credit or credit cards, let me see, you have no credit.  That’s just the way things are in the present.  Its not how it was 50 years ago.  Lots of cards give you cash back,1%,2%,3%,5% and on and on.  Only spend what you can afford and then get cash back.   Its a no brainer

        I never carried an AMEX card, or any card that asked me to pay a fee for making them money, for that matter.  I did open an account with the AMEX Brokerage for a period. Huge mistake!  Money would dissappear and reappear in my account for no reason.  They completely bungled reporting dividens and sales.  I make sure to throw out anything from AMEX  that appears in my mailbox immediately.

        The best credit card, is NO CREDIT CARD…..
- |
  Dad said. ” If you can’t pay cash for it, then you probably don’t need it all that bad…”
- |
  I haven’t found the need for any credit cards in the nearly 60 years I’ve been on this planet..
- |
  I only borrowed money one time back in the Army to purchase a limited Luxury edition
- |
  of the 1973 Plymouth Barracuda that some guy was selling for $4,000.00 at the time..
- |
  I rushed back on base to the credit union and pulled a $4 500.00 quick cash loan and was back at the dealer in less than 30 minutes only to find out the guy sold the rare car for $5000.00 while I was at the bank.. They only built 50 of those cars and I had planned to put it into storage until I retired and sell 6 at auction for as much as it
- |
  would bring..  About a year ago, I saw that same mint condition model Barracuda
- |
  sell at Barret’s Classic Auto Auction for a little over  $150,000.00..  I was so pissed at myself for not going to the bank to begin with,  that I never borrowed money for anything ever again…..

        The fact of the matter is if you can’t afford to pay your credit card off each month, then don’t use your credit card.  But if your like me, and pay your card off each month, then your foolish to not take advantage of the cash back offers credit cards offer.  I’ve received hundreds of dollars each year from cash back for my gas purchases, cell phone bill, and even a “1% back on all purchases” card will net you a substantial amount each year.  I’ll admit when I was younger I got suckered in by the credit cards, and paid a fair amount of interest penalties, but now I’m getting all that money back and more by taking advantage of these cash back rewards.  It’s free money folks…

        I cancelled my American Express card because they never supported me when I needed it the most.  I had a little accident when driving a rental car and American Express said  they couldn’t help me.  The cost of the damages were $840.00.  They did nothing.  They said that they didn’t cover anything.   I don’t know why they always say that if  we use their card when renting a car we don’t have to worry about anything.  That is a lie, huge lie.  In two different ocassions I needed them, but they did not help.  The second time they didn’t help me it was when I thought that it wasn’t worth it to have the Card and cancelled it.  I didn’t trust them anymore.   I don’t want anything to do with American Express anymore.

        American Express has decided not to renew its agreement with Costco, that is why they have the new card: damage control! Early in 2016 it will go to Citi and I will drop my AmEx card which charges merchants too much and as one commenter said, is not accepted as widely, especially in Europe where Visa reins supreme.

        I had an American Express a while back. Too many places didn’t accept it. One place that did asked me if I had any other cards that I could use. The retailer told me that American Express charges much higher rates and they would prefer that I use anything else. I will stick with the Double Cash card. As for the others, I have never paid credit card interest so low rates are not a benefit for me.

  Never finance with a credit card unless the rate is less than you are paying on a car loan and never buy what you cannot afford to pay for when the bill comes.

        I’ve been doing this for years to beat the interest! Every time you use your card, write it in your checkbook and deduct the amount. End of month when statement comes, add back the balance and pay the bill in full. If you can’t afford to do this you should not have a card! Who can afford those humungus rates?

        AMEX is and always has been a credit rip off.  With the likes of Chase Freedom and even Sam’s Club Master Card,  AMEX cash back is a farce from the get go.  And PAY an annual fee just for the card??????    I have 2 Chase Freedom cards, an Ink card, Sam’s Master card and Lowes.   I pay off EVERYTHING each month and my FICO score is 630.  I’ve never paid for a credit card.   I have a savings account at Ally Bank, which pays me 1% interest.  YOU can do far better than  AMEX.

        American Express will not give you 3% cash back unless it is only big gas stations like Chevron, Texaco,  Shell, ARCO etc. But if you go any gas station which are also groceries stations too they give  you no cash back. Same as the supermarket too. It is kind of misleading information. I don’t like this card at all.

        American express is not give you 3% cash back on petrol, unless you purchased it from Texaco, Chevron and like others which are the only gas stations. If you are going to go buy the petrol from fred meyer, safeway, or QFC, they will give you nothing. In this way I don’t like this card, also they are one month behind to give any 3% gas reward.

        What amazes me is how many people claim to be experts on credit and finances and yet they carry over a credit card balance from month to month. Why have 14 credit cards and plan on them for an emergency fund? The best way I have personally found and that many of my students of Financial Peace University have found is to have a cash emergency fund. A minimum of $1000 in a cash savings account will do, but a 3-6 month household expenses emergency fund will do far better and your life will be much better off for it.
- |
  If you are too cash poor to pay off your credit cards, then you are too poor to even use those same credit cards. I have two credit cards, one for personal use and one for business use. They both get paid off every month, have no fees, and I don’t really care what the interest rate is on them as I have never (As in not one single time since I got the cards) carried a balance over from one month to the next.
- |
  As for me, I make a modest income, pay attention to my finances, and I am not a sucker who buys everything I see or falls for the store ‘discount’ if I apply for credit. I do live quite well all the same. I even plan to have my 15 year mortgage paid off in less than half of that amount of time. And I still have a credit score in the 820+ range.

        Claire, you’re thinking of the Blue Cash Everyday Card (3% on groceries).  Blue Cash Preferred from American express is in fact 6% cash back up to $6,000 in annual purchases.  Also 3% on gas and 3% back from most large department stores.  This is simply the best cash back card out there and if advertised better should be a must have card for most households.

        The definition of “Good” by this “Advisor” seems to be how much cashback you get or the period of 0% APR. Never is any mention made of the predatory interest rates on balances. It is all focused on consumption. O% APR only works if you have the money to pay off the balance at the end AND if you spend your time tracking when one 0% ends and go through the hassle of getting a new one. I’ve had the same 10% fixed APR cards for over 20 years and don’t have the time to figure out which card pays which % for which type of purchase; even 10% is predatory in a 0% interest earnings environment.  We did get a Venture One card when my daughter lived overseas because of low/no Foreign Transaction fees which we occasionally earn Price Erase dollars with when we travel but we pay that card off timely because of the 16% APR.

        As far as points cards go, the Barclay Arrival Plus World Elite Mastercard is inferior to the Chase Sapphire because the World Card does not let you transfer points to airlines, and that’s the best use of points. It is nonsense to say that the Barclay Card is the only one with true chip and pin technology. My Sapphire Card has it and  I’m sure many others. The Sapphire Card also charges no overseas transfer fees and it becomes the main insurer when you use it for rental cars. Look very closely at the Sapphire card before you take what I consider to be the largely flawed advice in this column.

        P.S. to my last.  BTW, I put small charges on all 14 cards each month (to keep them “active”).  And each month, I pay off the balances in full.  My purpose of having so many cards is simple.  They’re my “safety net” – protecting me against surprise emergency expenses.  My combined utilization rate on all cards is under 5% – and my credit score is 748.

        The only credit card I’d consider “evil” would be a card issued by a predatory issuer – one that markets to people who have bad credit with $300 credit limits and a $100 annual fee (with monthly “maintenance” fees) and/or issuance fees.
- |
  Beyond those cards, there are only smart cardholders and stupid cardholders.  I know because I was married to a stupid cardholder for 20 years before I finally divorced her.  Early on in our marriage, she got a VISA with a $500 credit limit.  Before the ink was dry on her signature, she was in a shopping mall – returning hours later with over a dozen pairs of shoes (and remaining credit in the single digits).  And when I asked her, “Why so many shoes?” she answered (seemingly shocked I’d even asked), “Because they were on sale!”  She maintained that attitude for the remainder of our marriage.
- |
  Shortly after I divorced her, she filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I was handling my debts just fine – until her creditors came after me (community property state).  Her debts were so large I was forced to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy just to stay afloat.  But in 2011, after 5 years of on-time payments to my trustee, I emerged from that debt-free.
- |
  Immediately after discharge, I applied for and got a secured VISA from my credit union.  And after 12 on-time monthly payments on the card, they converted it to an unsecured card.  A year later in 2013 (7 years from the filing date), all Chapter 13 notations dropped away from my credit reports.  And armed with a clean credit file and 2 years good history on that one VISA card, I began applying for other cards.
- |
  As of today, I have 14 credit cards with a $34k combined credit limit.  None of them have any fees and all of them are unsecured.  My ex?  She currently has one new VISA card (the predatory kind).  And sadly, after the divorce bankruptcy, she started getting herself into debt trouble again.  Fortunately for her, she acquired a new boyfriend (“sugar daddy”) who took on my earlier role of trying to bail her out of debt.  Unfortunately, one of the first things he gave her was (ahem) herpes.  What comes around goes around, I guess.

Before the ink was dry on her signature, she was in a shopping mall – returning hours later with over a dozen pairs of shoes (and remaining credit in the single digits).  And when I asked her, “Why so many shoes?” she answered (seemingly shocked I’d even asked), “Because they were on sale!”  She maintained that attitude for the remainder of our marriage.

  Shortly after I divorced her, she filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I was handling my debts just fine – until her creditors came after me (community property state).  Her debts were so large I was forced to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy just to stay afloat.  But in 2011, after 5 years of on-time payments to my trustee, I emerged from that debt-free.
- |
  Immediately after discharge, I applied for and got a secured VISA from my credit union.  And after 12 on-time monthly payments on the card, they converted it to an unsecured card.  A year later in 2013 (7 years from the filing date), all Chapter 13 notations dropped away from my credit reports.  And armed with a clean credit file and 2 years good history on that one VISA card, I began applying for other cards.
- |
  As of today, I have 14 credit cards with a $34k combined credit limit.  None of them have any fees and all of them are unsecured.  My ex?  She currently has one new VISA card (the predatory kind).  And sadly, after the divorce bankruptcy, she started getting herself into debt trouble again.  Fortunately for her, she acquired a new boyfriend (“sugar daddy”) who took on my earlier role of trying to bail her out of debt.  Unfortunately, one of the first things he gave her was (ahem) herpes.  What comes around goes around, I guess.

        I can’t take advantage of any balance transfers because my ex purposely defaulted on three mortgages with my name on them.  He was awarded these houses in the divorce settlement, but the banks would not take my name off the mortgages.  None of my current creditors care about my dilemma, especially Citi, who is perfectly happy gouging me for 26% interest on my current card.   None of the cards is interested in helping anyone out of paying them interest.

        I love how the people who believe there are no ‘Good’ credit cards, are also the ones who have no idea how to manage their money. The main reason to ever have a credit card is to build up your credit score. The world works around credit scores. Thats how buisnesses trust to do transactions with you. Need a car, you also need a credit score. Need a house, or apartment, you also need a credit score. If you pay the card off in full each month, you don’t have to deal with interest rates. If you plan on paying only the minimum, than you’re going to put yourself in a never ending hole of debt. (It also lowers your score.) If you don’t know how to spend your money wisely, it isn’t the credit cards fault. It’s yours.

        Lies, and Cheats…  Credit Cards are not in anyone’s best interest.  They take your money, and give you very little in return.  Save your money or invest!!!!  I’ll never go back.  Lost too much on credit cards.

        There  is NO good BANK card.  I long ago put my money in a credit union where there are no fees, pay interest on checking, a free credit card with a reasonable interest rate, free bill pay and I never pay any fees because I pay in full each month.  I have one credit card – Amex – which I also pay in full each month.  It can be done, folks.  I live on Social Security and don’t spend beyond my ability to pay.  That’s the secret!

        Yep save silver for the dollar collapse and never trust banks. Just cash your check there and walk out with all the money. The money can be taken. I walk in cash my check get all the cash and a few rolls of nickels (copper / nickel alloy hoarding) and leave. Do not trust.

        Chase Freedom has a hidden benefit for travelers: it has FREE insurance against travel interruptions or cancellations.  Flight cancelled due to weather?  Normally tough luck.  Get  sick or a death in the family?  Too bad.  Companion develops a flying problem?  So sad for you.  Unless you have the insurance.  They are great to work with.  I used it to fly to California from the middle of the country and board a cruise.  Had the weather made me miss the flight it would be reimbursed or be applied to to another cruise.  Purchased cruise insurance is basically worthless unless something happens under their rules.  I used it when my mom couldn’t fly to Australia, full refund where we would have had to walk away from $4,000.

  I pay it off every month and it’s the greatest card in my wallet.

        Discover tops my list.  They’re prompt at responding to inquiries, problems, whatever.  Very courteous, polite, whether online or person to person.  Using a card wisely is key.  I’m a Depression child, and am fully aware of the benefits and pitfalls of credit.   School children deserve to start hearing about wise spending as early as 1st grade and  throughout their learning careers.

        Darius, you’re making a circular (faulty) claim…if people who couldn’t use the cards properly didn’t – you wouldn’t be getting any rewards.  The money is coming from the misuse of the cards by others, you are gaining by an industry that is taking intentional advantage of others.  It’s like saying people who can’t win gambling in Las Vegas shouldn’t go…but if none of the losers went – there would be no Las Vegas to go to.
- |
  If you don’t mind gaining off the backs of those losing (ie: pyramid scheme), then credit card rewards are for you.  It’s the principle of the thing, just b/c it doesn’t look like bad from your perspective…you have to decide if the entire structure is something you want to contribute too.

        Credit unions are insured by the NCUA.
- |
  Banks are insured by the FDIC.
- |
  Both the NCUA and the FDIC have less than double digit percentages of the insured resources in their reserves, so you better be in the first 7 percent of people who trusted their bank and/or credit union.
- |
  Both agencies have already been ordered to make anything over the $250,000 limit available for bail-ins.  When that is gone, what do you really think is going to stop them from taking everything else in the bank?
- |
  Your cash is safer in a good hiding place than in any bank or credit union, although most people will learn this the hard way when the bank holidays begin.
- |
  Your best investment is in paying off every debt you can, and then buying physical assets, food, bullets, gold, silver…

        My relationship with Discover spans three decades.  Before the internet, when colleges didn’t charge extra for using a credit card, I used to put my tuition on the Discover card.  When the bill came in, I wrote a check, put it in the envelope, and wrote a ‘mail by’ date on the envelope — hoping my reimbursement would arrive before the check reached Discover.  One month, I got a bill with an unusually high balance and interest.  I called to see what was wrong.  As the Discover CSR explained that my check had not been received, I moved a shopping list which was covering my unpaid bill.  The CSR said I was a good customer, forgave the interest, and gave me an adjusted balance to pay.  They advertise that today, but have been doing it for a generation.
- |
  There’s more, of course.  Extended warranties, price protection, cash back, discounted gift cards, and cash back for referrals make Discover an attractive charge card.  I think their security is unusual.  When my niece went to Europe last year, she was able to use her mother’s credit cards without verifying her identity.  When my college student and I used the same Discover card at gas stations in two towns within minutes, Discover called, texted, and emailed me to contact them regarding suspicious activity.  I appreciate that.

        I see there are those here who do not like credit cards. Well, if you are unable to use them properly you should not use them. I have been using credit cards since 1983, have never paid a cent to them and have received and average of $500/year from them for using their cards. So I want to give my thanks to all of you who help the card companies pay me for using their cards. Free enterprise is wonderful when you understand and use the rules to your benefit.

        I see there are those here who do not like credit cards. Well, if you are unable to use them properly you should not use them. I have been using credit cards since 1983, have never paid a cent to them and have received and average of $500/year from them for using their cards. So I want to give my thanks to all of you who help the card companies pay me for using their cards. Free enterprise is wonderful when you understand and use the rules to your benefit.

        Tasha needs to get out of the forrest so she can see the trees.  Most Credit Unions are open to anyone now, and any NON-PROFIT credit card is better that a for-profit bank card, duh !

  There is no such thing as a bank giving you “cash-back”. Except for freedompop home  internet, nothing is free. If they can give you miles or cash back, they have to add a lot of hidden fees to get the money. Think a business is really stupid enough to lose money to make you happy ?  ( The first year onto the recession, Chase made 100 billion profit on cash-back credit cards while giving $100 to open a checking account. Unaware to most,  Credit Card debt was the second cause of the recession. )

        Use cards that have cash back features, but avoid ones with initial fees, and ALWAYS pay them off each month.    That way you get the advantage of no interest charges on your card purchases AND the bonus of cash back rewards.   A one-percent cash back on purchases you are going to make anyway is a better return than most savings accounts these days.

  30, 2015Whether you’ve got a balance you can’t fully pay off from some big purchases,
  are looking to earn some extra rewards or want to save up for that vacation, getting
  the right credit card can easily save you hundreds or thousands of dollars. With
  the economy on the upswing, right now credit card issuers are courting potential
  cardholders by offering spectacular bonuses, lengthy 0% intro APRs and generous
  reward programs.Â If your credit card falls short, it may be time to upgrade your
  wallet. Help improve your financial situation by taking advantage of these terrific
  credit card offers for 2015 while they’re still available.Best Cash Back Card :Â Blue
  Cash Preferred Card from American ExpressThe winner of our cash back card analysis,
  Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express (a NextAdvisor advertiser) combines
  excellent cash back rewards with a generous 15-month 0% APR period. You’ll earn
  6% cash back at supermarkets (on up to $6K in purchases annually), 3% at gas stations
  and select department stores like Sears, JCP, Kohls, Nordstrom and Macy’s, and 1%
  cash back on all your other purchases. Plus, there’s a $150 bonusÂ after spending
  $1,000 in the first 3 months – pretty easy to earn if you use your card like a typical
  consumer. On top of this you can take advantage of its 0% intro APR for the first
  15 months on purchases and balance transfers (although there is a 3% balance transfer
  fee). I really like this card because of its huge cash back potential. Anyone who
  spends a lot on groceries and gas can really rack up the cash back rewards. And
  you don’t have to sign up quarterly to get your cash back – it’s automatic. There
  is a $75 annual fee, which can be off-putting to some, but honestly if you use your
  card like a typical consumer you should more than earn this back. If you prefer
  a card with no annual fee, generous and straightforward cash back rewards (effective
  2% cash back on everything!) and a 15-month 0% intro APR period, check out the Citi
  Double Cash Card. Or to find out which cash back card is the best for your spending
  patterns, use our free Personalized Cash Back Calculator.Best Balance Transfer Card:
  ChaseÂ SlateIf you overdid it on some shopping purchases and can’t fully pay off
  your balance on one or more credit cards, ChaseÂ Slate is the card for you.Â  Instead
  of starting to rack up huge interest fees, you can transfer your balances to the
  Chase Slate. With a 15-month 0% intro APR on balance transfers and purchases, as
  well as no balance transfer fees and no annual fee, this card can save you a ton
  in interest payments. It’s the only card we’ve found that offers both no balance
  transfer fee and a lengthy 0% intro APR. And unlike other cards with stellar features
  like these, people with merely good credit (often viewed as a credit score above
  660) have a chance to be approved for this card. Note that the $0 balance transfer
  fee is only available for the first 60 days, but since the reason most people get
  this card is to transfer their balances immediately that shouldn’t be an issue.Â 
  If you’re in the market for a balance-transfer card and aren’t sure which one is
  best for your situation, take a look at our free Balance Transfer CalculatorÂ to
  determine which card will save you the most.Best Low APR Card:Â Citi SimplicityLeading
  the pack with an outstanding 21-month 0% intro APR (the longest we’ve found) and
  no annual fee or late fees, Citi Simplicity will carry you well into 2017 interest-free.
  You’ll enjoy a 0% intro APR period for 21 months (that’s over 1.5 years!) on both
  purchases and balance transfers. Plus you won’t pay late fees, penalty rates or
  an annual fee. Although we encourage our readers to pay their cards on time to maintain
  a healthy credit score, having no late fees and no penalty rates is a huge bonus
  for anyone who may be late with a payment every now and then.Â Now is the time to
  get this card, as any purchases you make will be interest-free until 2017. This
  extended 0% APR period will allow you to pay down your balance over time without
  costing you anything in interest fees. Note this card does have a 3% balance transfer
  fee.Best Travel Card:Â Capital One Venture Rewards CardIf you’re saving up for that
  big vacation or are just a frequent traveler, you should strongly consider the Capital
  One Venture Rewards Card. It starts off with a 40,000 point bonus – equal to $400
  in travel – after you spend $3,000 in the first 90 days. Plus you’ll earn 2 miles
  for every dollar you spend. That’s 2x miles onÂ everyÂ purchase, not just in certain
  categories or on special deals you have to sign up for quarterly. Â Using your earned
  miles is easy too- just book your travel and then redeem your miles as a statement
  credit against your travel costs. You can travel however and wherever you’d like;
  on any airline, at any hotel and with any rental car company (or cruise!). You can
  also make your travel plans however you would like; online, with a travel agent
  or over the phone. The bottom line is that you just need to pay for the travel with
  this card, it’s as simple as that.The Capital One Venture Rewards CardÂ had a very
  high reward value of $2.00 for every $100 spent in both the flight and hotel categories
  in ourÂ Travel Rewards Credit Card Analysis. This high value means that your miles
  are worth more than with other popular travel cards on the market today. And an
  added perk is that when you travel outside the U.S. you won’t have to pay foreign
  transaction fees and it hasÂ chip and signature technology. The card does have a
  $59 annual fee, but it’s waived the first year so you’ll have a year to determine
  if this card is right for you before having to pay an annual charge. As an added
  bonus, the cardÂ was designed for people with good to excellent credit, making it
  a little more accessible than cards that require excellent credit.Best Card for
  Anyone with Good (but not Great) Credit: Chase FreedomIf you’re in the market for
  a credit card but don’t necessarily have terrific credit, Chase Freedom might be
  right up your alley. It was developed for those with “Good” credit, which is typically
  considered to be a credit score between 660 and 724 on the FICO credit score scale
  (if you don’t know your credit score you can get it for free). The card doesn’t
  skimp on extras either – to start with you’ll get an enormous $150 intro bonus after
  spending just $500 in the first 3 months. You’ll also earn 5% cash back on up to
  $1,500 in purchases in categories that rotate quarterly (note: you need to register
  each quarter to receive this cash back), and 1% back on everything else you buy.
  Plus there’s no annual fee to worry about paying. We really like this card because
  it has the great features that cards typically oriented towards consumers with great
  credit do, but it’s available to those who might have a hit or two on the credit
  report.Best Card for Students: Discover it for StudentsOffering both cash back rewards
  and a 0% intro APR,Â Discover it for Students hits the mark for the college-bound.
  First off, you’ll earn 5% cash back on up to $1,500 in purchases in categories that
  rotate quarterly and 1% cash back on all other purchases. You will need to register
  online quarterly to receive the 5% back, but it’s worth it. Plus, you can take advantage
  of a 6-month 0% intro APR on your purchases. That means you’ll pay no interest at
  all for the first 6 months you have this card. We’re not encouraging student debt,
  but it’s nice to know if you put a gift or two and some textbooks on your card you’ll
  have 6 months to pay for them without owing any interest. Just make sure you practice
  responsible use of your card and you’ll be able to build a credit history and boost
  your credit score. And did we mention there is no annual fee AND no foreign transaction
  fees? So if you travel outside the U.S. you won’t pay any additional fees to use
  your card, which can save you a ton of money. Overall this is a great card for any
  college (or grad school) student that combines strong rewards with a 0% intro APR
  on purchases and very reasonable ongoing interest rate.Best Card for Businesses:
  Ink Cash Business CardInk Cash Business Card is a terrific pick for business. It
  serves up some great business-oriented features including generous cash back rewards,
  a 0% intro APR and no annual fee. Plus there’s a $200 bonus after spending $3,000
  in the first 3 months. In addition you’ll earn 5% cash back on purchases at office
  supply stores and on landline, cellular phone, internet and cable TV services (on
  up to $25,000 in combined purchases). You’ll also get 2% cash back on the first
  $25,000 in combined purchases at restaurants and gas stations and an unlimited 1%
  cash back on all other purchases. Â On the downside, the 5% and 2% cash back rewards
  are issued annually on your account anniversary, but the 1% cash back rewards are
  issued monthly. The 12-month 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers can
  be very helpful to new businesses looking to make some big purchases they don’t
  need to pay off for a year, or to mature businesses who just want to take advantage
  of paying no interest on their purchases and balance transfers for a year.Best Card

  . Does anyone know where my assistant could possibly find a blank Calendar copy
  to fill out ?There are too many Gen Essers writing about finance.  Unless you are
  over age 50, you can’t possibly know enough to be criticizing or advising anyone
  about finance and economic matters.  Robert Campbell C.D.For the person who has
  to wait for a chip … let me see it has nothing to do with you.   Its really between
  the store and the credit card co.    You have to check into the credit card co before
  you apply for one.  American Express has one if you spend 1,000.00 in three months
  you get 300.00 back.  Let me see, is that good, and no yearly charge.  With out
  credit or credit cards, let me see, you have no credit.  That’s just the way things
  are in the present.  Its not how it was 50 years ago.  Lots of cards give you cash
  back,1%,2%,3%,5% and on and on.  Only spend what you can afford and then get cash
  back.   Its a no brainerMusic started playing any time I opened up this website,
  so irritating!After inquiring, my credit union said that they will not be sending
  me a chip card until the end of 2016 !! Is there something illegal about this that
  I have to wait so long for security ??I never carried an AMEX card, or any card
  that asked me to pay a fee for making them money, for that matter.  I did open an
  account with the AMEX Brokerage for a period. Huge mistake!  Money would dissappear
  and reappear in my account for no reason.  They completely bungled reporting dividens
  and sales.  I make sure to throw out anything from AMEX  that appears in my mailbox
  immediately.The best credit card, is NO CREDIT CARD…..\n"

  Dad said. ” If you can’t pay cash for it, then you probably don’t need it all that bad…”

  I haven’t found the need for any credit cards in the nearly 60 years I’ve been on this planet..

  I only borrowed money one time back in the Army to purchase a limited Luxury edition

  of the 1973 Plymouth Barracuda that some guy was selling for $4,000.00 at the time..

  I rushed back on base to the credit union and pulled a $4 500.00 quick cash loan and was back at the dealer in less than 30 minutes only to find out the guy sold the rare car for $5000.00 while I was at the bank.. They only built 50 of those cars and I had planned to put it into storage until I retired and sell 6 at auction for as much as it

  would bring..  About a year ago, I saw that same mint condition model Barracuda

  sell at Barret’s Classic Auto Auction for a little over  $150,000.00..  I was so pissed at myself for not going to the bank to begin with,  that I never borrowed money for anything ever again…..The fact of the matter is if you can’t afford to pay your credit card off each month, then don’t use your credit card.  But if your like me, and pay your card off each month, then your foolish to not take advantage of the cash back offers credit cards offer.  I’ve received hundreds of dollars each year from cash back for my gas purchases, cell phone bill, and even a “1% back on all purchases” card will net you a substantial amount each year.  I’ll admit when I was younger I got suckered in by the credit cards, and paid a fair amount of interest penalties, but now I’m getting all that money back and more by taking advantage of these cash back rewards.  It’s free money folks…SORRY MS. TASHA  LOCKYER

  ACCORDING  TO THE ABOVE CREDIT CARD HOLDERS AND MYSELF , YOU APPARENTLY DID NOT DO A VERY GOOD JOB IN THE LAST 6 YEARS WHEN YOU COVERED “all things”  YOU SEEMED TO HAVE MISSED QUITE A FEW. MOST OF THESE CREDIT CARD CO. HAVE SCREWED OVER MOST OF US ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. I NOW ONLY USE MY CC IN CASE OF EMERGENCY ONLY

  LISAwould TY  on June 22nd  write e mail me  how you cut your mortgage  in half  the timeI cancelled my American Express card because they never supported me when I needed it the most.  I had a little accident when driving a rental car and American Express said  they couldn’t help me.  The cost of the damages were $840.00.  They did nothing.  They said that they didn’t cover anything.   I don’t know why they always say that if  we use their card when renting a car we don’t have to worry about anything.  That is a lie, huge lie.  In two different ocassions I needed them, but they did not help.  The second time they didn’t help me it was when I thought that it wasn’t worth it to have the Card and cancelled it.  I didn’t trust them anymore.   I don’t want anything to do with American Express anymore.American Express has decided not to renew its agreement with Costco, that is why they have the new card: damage control! Early in 2016 it will go to Citi and I will drop my AmEx card which charges merchants too much and as one commenter said, is not accepted as widely, especially in Europe where Visa reins supreme.I had an American Express a while back. Too many places didn’t accept it. One place that did asked me if I had any other cards that I could use. The retailer told me that American Express charges much higher rates and they would prefer that I use anything else. I will stick with the Double Cash card. As for the others, I have never paid credit card interest so low rates are not a benefit for me.Never finance with a credit card unless the rate is less than you are paying on a car loan and never buy what you cannot afford to pay for when the bill comes.I’ve been doing this for years to beat the interest! Every time you use your card, write it in your checkbook and deduct the amount. End of month when statement comes, add back the balance and pay the bill in full. If you can’t afford to do this you should not have a card! Who can afford those humungus rates?AMEX is and always has been a credit rip off.  With the likes of Chase Freedom and even Sam’s Club Master Card,  AMEX cash back is a farce from the get go.  And PAY an annual fee just for the card??????    I have 2 Chase Freedom cards, an Ink card, Sam’s Master card and Lowes.   I pay off EVERYTHING each month and my FICO score is 630.  I’ve never paid for a credit card.   I have a savings account at Ally Bank, which pays me 1% interest.  YOU can do far better than  AMEX.BS.The best credit card is NO credit card.American Express will not give you 3% cash back unless it is only big gas stations like Chevron, Texaco,  Shell, ARCO etc. But if you go any gas station which are also groceries stations too they give  you no cash back. Same as the supermarket too. It is kind of misleading information. I don’t like this card at all.American Express will not give you 3% cash back unless it is only big gas stations like Chevron, Texaco,  Shell, ARCO etc. But if you go any gas station which are also groceries stations too they give  you no cash back. Same as the supermarket too. It is kind of misleading information. I don’t like this card at all.American express is not give you 3% cash back on petrol, unless you purchased it from Texaco, Chevron and like others which are the only gas stations. If you are going to go buy the petrol from fred meyer, safeway, or QFC, they will give you nothing. In this way I don’t like this card, also they are one month behind to give any 3% gas reward.American express is not give you 3% cash back on petrol, unless you purchased it from Texaco, Chevron and like others which are the only gas stations.

Why have 14 credit cards and plan on them for an emergency fund? The best way I have personally found and that many of my students of Financial Peace University have found is to have a cash emergency fund. A minimum of $1000 in a cash savings account will do, but a 3-6 month household expenses emergency fund will do far better and your life will be much better off for it.If you are too cash poor to pay off your credit cards, then you are too poor to even use those same credit cards. I have two credit cards, one for personal use and one for business use. They both get paid off every month, have no fees, and I don’t really care what the interest rate is on them as I have never (As in not one single time since I got the cards) carried a balance over from one month to the next.As for me, I make a modest income, pay attention to my finances, and I am not a sucker who buys everything I see or falls for the store ‘discount’ if I apply for credit. I do live quite well all the same. I even plan to have my 15 year mortgage paid off in less than half of that amount of time. And I still have a credit score in the 820+ range.Managing your credit cards better may not work for you, but it certainly does work for many of us out here in the real world.What amazes me is how many people claim to be experts on credit and finances and yet they carry over a credit card balance from month to month.

Blue Cash Preferred from American express is in fact 6% cash back up to $6,000 in annual purchases.  Also 3% on gas and 3% back from most large department stores.  This is simply the best cash back card out there and if advertised better should be a must have card for most households.This and the Visa Signature rewards cards are the best reward offerings out there.Claire, you’re thinking of the Blue Cash Everyday Card (3% on groceries).

Never is any mention made of the predatory interest rates on balances. It is all focused on consumption. O% APR only works if you have the money to pay off the balance at the end AND if you spend your time tracking when one 0% ends and go through the hassle of getting a new one. I’ve had the same 10% fixed APR cards for over 20 years and don’t have the time to figure out which card pays which % for which type of purchase; even 10% is predatory in a 0% interest earnings environment.  We did get a Venture One card when my daughter lived overseas because of low/no Foreign Transaction fees which we occasionally earn Price Erase dollars with when we travel but we pay that card off timely because of the 16% APR.The definition of “Good” by this “Advisor” seems to be how much cashback you get or the period of 0% APR.

It is nonsense to say that the Barclay Card is the only one with true chip and pin technology. My Sapphire Card has it and  I’m sure many others. The Sapphire Card also charges no overseas transfer fees and it becomes the main insurer when you use it for rental cars. Look very closely at the Sapphire card before you take what I consider to be the largely flawed advice in this column.As far as points cards go, the Barclay Arrival Plus World Elite Mastercard is inferior to the Chase Sapphire because the World Card does not let you transfer points to airlines, and that’s the best use of points.

BTW, I put small charges on all 14 cards each month (to keep them “active”).  And each month, I pay off the balances in full.  My purpose of having so many cards is simple.  They’re my “safety net” – protecting me against surprise emergency expenses.  My combined utilization rate on all cards is under 5% – and my credit score is 748.P.S. to my last.

My combined utilization rate on all cards is under 5% – and my credit score is 748.The only credit card I’d consider “evil” would be a card issued by a predatory issuer – one that markets to people who have bad credit with $300 credit limits and a $100 annual fee (with monthly “maintenance” fees) and/or issuance fees.Beyond those cards, there are only smart cardholders and stupid cardholders.  I know because I was married to a stupid cardholder for 20 years before I finally divorced her.  Early on in our marriage, she got a VISA with a $500 credit limit.  Before the ink was dry on her signature, she was in a shopping mall – returning hours later with over a dozen pairs of shoes (and remaining credit in the single digits).  And when I asked her, “Why so many shoes?” she answered (seemingly shocked I’d even asked), “Because they were on sale!”  She maintained that attitude for the remainder of our marriage.Shortly after I divorced her, she filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I was handling my debts just fine – until her creditors came after me (community property state).  Her debts were so large I was forced to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy just to stay afloat.  But in 2011, after 5 years of on-time payments to my trustee, I emerged from that debt-free.Immediately after discharge, I applied for and got a secured VISA from my credit union.  And after 12 on-time monthly payments on the card, they converted it to an unsecured card.  A year later in 2013 (7 years from the filing date), all Chapter 13 notations dropped away from my credit reports.  And armed with a clean credit file and 2 years good history on that one VISA card, I began applying for other cards.As of today, I have 14 credit cards with a $34k combined credit limit.  None of them have any fees and all of them are unsecured.  My ex?  She currently has one new VISA card (the predatory kind).  And sadly, after the divorce bankruptcy, she started getting herself into debt trouble again.  Fortunately for her, she acquired a new boyfriend (“sugar daddy”) who took on my earlier role of trying to bail her out of debt.

He was awarded these houses in the divorce settlement, but the banks would not take my name off the mortgages.  None of my current creditors care about my dilemma, especially Citi, who is perfectly happy gouging me for 26% interest on my current card.

The main reason to ever have a credit card is to build up your credit score. The world works around credit scores. Thats how buisnesses trust to do transactions with you. Need a car, you also need a credit score. Need a house, or apartment, you also need a credit score. If you pay the card off in full each month, you don’t have to deal with interest rates. If you plan on paying only the minimum, than you’re going to put yourself in a never ending hole of debt. (It also lowers your score.) If you don’t know how to spend your money wisely, it isn’t the credit cards fault. It’s yours.I love how the people who believe there are no ‘Good’ credit cards, are also the ones who have no idea how to manage their money.

When the bill came in, I wrote a check, put it in the envelope, and wrote a ‘mail by’ date on the envelope — hoping my reimbursement would arrive before the check reached Discover.  One month, I got a bill with an unusually high balance and interest.  I called to see what was wrong.  As the Discover CSR explained that my check had not been received, I moved a shopping list which was covering my unpaid bill.  The CSR said I was a good customer, forgave the interest, and gave me an adjusted balance to pay.  They advertise that today, but have been doing it for a generation.There’s more, of course.  Extended warranties, price protection, cash back, discounted gift cards, and cash back for referrals make Discover an attractive charge card.  I think their security is unusual.  When my niece went to Europe last year, she was able to use her mother’s credit cards without verifying her identity.  When my college student and I used the same Discover card at gas stations in two towns within minutes, Discover called, texted, and emailed me to contact them regarding suspicious activity.  I appreciate that.My relationship with Discover spans three decades.  Before the internet, when colleges didn’t charge extra for using a credit card, I used to put my tuition on the Discover card.

Well, if you are unable to use them properly you should not use them. I have been using credit cards since 1983, have never paid a cent to them and have received and average of $500/year from them for using their cards. So I want to give my thanks to all of you who help the card companies pay me for using their cards. Free enterprise is wonderful when you understand and use the rules to your benefit.I see there are those here who do not like credit cards.

  There is no such thing as a bank giving you “cash-back”. Except for freedompop home  internet, nothing is free. If they can give you miles or cash back, they have to add a lot of hidden fees to get the money. Think a business is really stupid enough to lose money to make you happy ?  ( The first year onto the recession, Chase made 100 billion profit on cash-back credit cards while giving $100 to open a checking account. Unaware to most,  Credit Card debt was the second cause of the recession. )Tasha needs to get out of the forrest so she can see the trees.

  off each month.    That way you get the advantage of no interest charges on your

  Credit Cards for 2015\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby Tasha Lockyer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember
  11, 2014\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUpdated: November 30, 2015\nWhether
  you’ve got a balance you can’t fully pay off from some big purchases, are looking
  to earn some extra rewards or want to save up for that vacation, getting the right
  credit card can easily save you hundreds or thousands of dollars. With the economy
  on the upswing, right now credit card issuers are courting potential cardholders
  by offering spectacular bonuses, lengthy 0% intro APRs and generous reward programs.Â If
  your credit card falls short, it may be time to upgrade your wallet. Help improve
  your financial situation by taking advantage of these terrific credit card offers
  for 2015 while they’re still available.\nBest Cash Back Card :Â Blue Cash Preferred
  Card from American ExpressThe winner of our cash back card analysis, Blue Cash Preferred
  Card from American Express (a NextAdvisor advertiser) combines excellent cash back
  rewards with a generous 15-month 0% APR period. You’ll earn 6% cash back at supermarkets
  (on up to $6K in purchases annually), 3% at gas stations and select department stores
  like Sears, JCP, Kohls, Nordstrom and Macy’s, and 1% cash back on all your other
  purchases. Plus, there’s a $150 bonusÂ after spending $1,000 in the first 3 months
  – pretty easy to earn if you use your card like a typical consumer. On top of this
  you can take advantage of its 0% intro APR for the first 15 months on purchases
  and balance transfers (although there is a 3% balance transfer fee). I really like
  this card because of its huge cash back potential. Anyone who spends a lot on groceries
  and gas can really rack up the cash back rewards. And you don’t have to sign up
  quarterly to get your cash back – it’s automatic. There is a $75 annual fee, which
  can be off-putting to some, but honestly if you use your card like a typical consumer
  you should more than earn this back. If you prefer a card with no annual fee, generous
  and straightforward cash back rewards (effective 2% cash back on everything!) and
  a 15-month 0% intro APR period, check out the Citi Double Cash Card. Or to find
  out which cash back card is the best for your spending patterns, use our free Personalized
  Cash Back Calculator.\nBest Balance Transfer Card: ChaseÂ Slate\n\nIf you overdid
  it on some shopping purchases and can’t fully pay off your balance on one or more
  credit cards, ChaseÂ Slate is the card for you.Â  Instead of starting to rack up
  huge interest fees, you can transfer your balances to the Chase Slate. With a 15-month
  0% intro APR on balance transfers and purchases, as well as no balance transfer
  fees and no annual fee, this card can save you a ton in interest payments. It’s
  the only card we’ve found that offers both no balance transfer fee and a lengthy
  0% intro APR. And unlike other cards with stellar features like these, people with
  merely good credit (often viewed as a credit score above 660) have a chance to be
  approved for this card. Note that the $0 balance transfer fee is only available
  for the first 60 days, but since the reason most people get this card is to transfer
  their balances immediately that shouldn’t be an issue.Â  If you’re in the market
  for a balance-transfer card and aren’t sure which one is best for your situation,
  take a look at our free Balance Transfer CalculatorÂ to determine which card will
  save you the most.\nBest Low APR Card:Â Citi Simplicity\nLeading the pack with an
  outstanding 21-month 0% intro APR (the longest we’ve found) and no annual fee or
  late fees, Citi Simplicity will carry you well into 2017 interest-free. You’ll enjoy
  a 0% intro APR period for 21 months (that’s over 1.5 years!) on both purchases and
  balance transfers. Plus you won’t pay late fees, penalty rates or an annual fee.
  Although we encourage our readers to pay their cards on time to maintain a healthy
  credit score, having no late fees and no penalty rates is a huge bonus for anyone
  who may be late with a payment every now and then.Â Now is the time to get this
  card, as any purchases you make will be interest-free until 2017. This extended
  0% APR period will allow you to pay down your balance over time without costing
  you anything in interest fees. Note this card does have a 3% balance transfer fee.\nBest
  Travel Card:Â Capital One Venture Rewards Card\n\nIf you’re saving up for that big
  vacation or are just a frequent traveler, you should strongly consider the Capital
  One Venture Rewards Card. It starts off with a 40,000 point bonus – equal to $400
  in travel – after you spend $3,000 in the first 90 days. Plus you’ll earn 2 miles
  for every dollar you spend. That’s 2x miles onÂ everyÂ purchase, not just in certain
  categories or on special deals you have to sign up for quarterly. Â Using your earned
  miles is easy too- just book your travel and then redeem your miles as a statement
  credit against your travel costs. You can travel however and wherever you’d like;
  on any airline, at any hotel and with any rental car company (or cruise!). You can
  also make your travel plans however you would like; online, with a travel agent
  or over the phone. The bottom line is that you just need to pay for the travel with
  this card, it’s as simple as that.\nThe Capital One Venture Rewards CardÂ had a
  very high reward value of $2.00 for every $100 spent in both the flight and hotel
  categories in ourÂ Travel Rewards Credit Card Analysis. This high value means that
  your miles are worth more than with other popular travel cards on the market today.
  And an added perk is that when you travel outside the U.S. you won’t have to pay
  foreign transaction fees and it hasÂ chip and signature technology. The card does
  have a $59 annual fee, but it’s waived the first year so you’ll have a year to determine
  if this card is right for you before having to pay an annual charge. As an added
  bonus, the cardÂ was designed for people with good to excellent credit, making it
  a little more accessible than cards that require excellent credit.\nBest Card for
  Anyone with Good (but not Great) Credit: Chase Freedom\nIf you’re in the market
  for a credit card but don’t necessarily have terrific credit, Chase Freedom might
  be right up your alley. It was developed for those with “Good” credit, which is
  typically considered to be a credit score between 660 and 724 on the FICO credit
  score scale (if you don’t know your credit score you can get it for free). The card
  doesn’t skimp on extras either – to start with you’ll get an enormous $150 intro
  bonus after spending just $500 in the first 3 months. You’ll also earn 5% cash back
  on up to $1,500 in purchases in categories that rotate quarterly (note: you need
  to register each quarter to receive this cash back), and 1% back on everything else
  you buy. Plus there’s no annual fee to worry about paying. We really like this card
  because it has the great features that cards typically oriented towards consumers
  with great credit do, but it’s available to those who might have a hit or two on
  the credit report.\nBest Card for Students: Discover it for Students\nOffering both
  cash back rewards and a 0% intro APR,Â Discover it for Students hits the mark for
  the college-bound. First off, you’ll earn 5% cash back on up to $1,500 in purchases
  in categories that rotate quarterly and 1% cash back on all other purchases. You
  will need to register online quarterly to receive the 5% back, but it’s worth it.
  Plus, you can take advantage of a 6-month 0% intro APR on your purchases. That means
  you’ll pay no interest at all for the first 6 months you have this card. We’re not
  encouraging student debt, but it’s nice to know if you put a gift or two and some
  textbooks on your card you’ll have 6 months to pay for them without owing any interest.
  Just make sure you practice responsible use of your card and you’ll be able to build
  a credit history and boost your credit score. And did we mention there is no annual
  fee AND no foreign transaction fees? So if you travel outside the U.S. you won’t
  pay any additional fees to use your card, which can save you a ton of money. Overall
  this is a great card for any college (or grad school) student that combines strong
  rewards with a 0% intro APR on purchases and very reasonable ongoing interest rate.\nBest
  Card for Businesses: Ink Cash Business Card\nInk Cash Business Card is a terrific
  pick for business. It serves up some great business-oriented features including
  generous cash back rewards, a 0% intro APR and no annual fee. Plus there’s a $200
  bonus after spending $3,000 in the first 3 months. In addition you’ll earn 5% cash
  back on purchases at office supply stores and on landline, cellular phone, internet
  and cable TV services (on up to $25,000 in combined purchases). You’ll also get
  2% cash back on the first $25,000 in combined purchases at restaurants and gas stations
  and an unlimited 1% cash back on all other purchases. Â On the downside, the 5%
  and 2% cash back rewards are issued annually on your account anniversary, but the
  1% cash back rewards are issued monthly. The 12-month 0% intro APR on purchases
  and balance transfers can be very helpful to new businesses looking to make some
  big purchases they don’t need to pay off for a year, or to mature businesses who
  just want to take advantage of paying no interest on their purchases and balance
  transfers for a year.\nBest Card for Average Credit: Barclaycard Rewards Mastercard\nBest

  the person who has to wait for a chip … let me see it has nothing to do with you.
  \  Its really between the store and the credit card co.    You have to check into
  the credit card co before you apply for one.  American Express has one if you spend
  1,000.00 in three months you get 300.00 back.  Let me see, is that good, and no
  yearly charge.  With out credit or credit cards, let me see, you have no credit.
  \ That’s just the way things are in the present.  Its not how it was 50 years ago.
  \ Lots of cards give you cash back,1%,2%,3%,5% and on and on.  Only spend what you
  can afford and then get cash back.   Its a no brainer\n\n      \n               \n

  a fee for making them money, for that matter.  I did open an account with the AMEX
  Brokerage for a period. Huge mistake!  Money would dissappear and reappear in my
  account for no reason.  They completely bungled reporting dividens and sales.  I
  make sure to throw out anything from AMEX  that appears in my mailbox immediately.\n\n

  is NO CREDIT CARD…..\nDad said. ” If you can’t pay cash for it, then you probably
  don’t need it all that bad…”\nI haven’t found the need for any credit cards in the
  nearly 60 years I’ve been on this planet..\nI only borrowed money one time back
  in the Army to purchase a limited Luxury edition\nof the 1973 Plymouth Barracuda
  that some guy was selling for $4,000.00 at the time..\nI rushed back on base to
  the credit union and pulled a $4 500.00 quick cash loan and was back at the dealer
  in less than 30 minutes only to find out the guy sold the rare car for $5000.00
  while I was at the bank.. They only built 50 of those cars and I had planned to
  put it into storage until I retired and sell 6 at auction for as much as it\nwould
  bring..  About a year ago, I saw that same mint condition model Barracuda\nsell
  at Barret’s Classic Auto Auction for a little over  $150,000.00..  I was so pissed
  at myself for not going to the bank to begin with,  that I never borrowed money
  for anything ever again…..\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n     \n      \n

  \     The fact of the matter is if you can’t afford to pay your credit card off
  each month, then don’t use your credit card.  But if your like me, and pay your
  card off each month, then your foolish to not take advantage of the cash back offers
  credit cards offer.  I’ve received hundreds of dollars each year from cash back
  for my gas purchases, cell phone bill, and even a “1% back on all purchases” card
  will net you a substantial amount each year.  I’ll admit when I was younger I got
  suckered in by the credit cards, and paid a fair amount of interest penalties, but
  now I’m getting all that money back and more by taking advantage of these cash back
  rewards.  It’s free money folks…\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n     \n

  \ \n\t  \n\n      I cancelled my American Express card because they never supported
  me when I needed it the most.  I had a little accident when driving a rental car
  and American Express said  they couldn’t help me.  The cost of the damages were
  $840.00.  They did nothing.  They said that they didn’t cover anything.   I don’t
  know why they always say that if  we use their card when renting a car we don’t
  have to worry about anything.  That is a lie, huge lie.  In two different ocassions
  I needed them, but they did not help.  The second time they didn’t help me it was
  when I thought that it wasn’t worth it to have the Card and cancelled it.  I didn’t
  trust them anymore.   I don’t want anything to do with American Express anymore.\n\n

  has decided not to renew its agreement with Costco, that is why they have the new
  card: damage control! Early in 2016 it will go to Citi and I will drop my AmEx card

  especially in Europe where Visa reins supreme.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n

  \ \n\t  \n\n      I had an American Express a while back. Too many places didn’t
  accept it. One place that did asked me if I had any other cards that I could use.
  The retailer told me that American Express charges much higher rates and they would
  prefer that I use anything else. I will stick with the Double Cash card. As for
  the others, I have never paid credit card interest so low rates are not a benefit
  for me.\nNever finance with a credit card unless the rate is less than you are paying
  on a car loan and never buy what you cannot afford to pay for when the bill comes.\n\n

  for years to beat the interest! Every time you use your card, write it in your checkbook
  and deduct the amount. End of month when statement comes, add back the balance and
  pay the bill in full. If you can’t afford to do this you should not have a card!
  Who can afford those humungus rates?\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n

  of Chase Freedom and even Sam’s Club Master Card,  AMEX cash back is a farce from
  the get go.  And PAY an annual fee just for the card??????    I have 2 Chase Freedom
  cards, an Ink card, Sam’s Master card and Lowes.   I pay off EVERYTHING each month
  and my FICO score is 630.  I’ve never paid for a credit card.   I have a savings
  account at Ally Bank, which pays me 1% interest.  YOU can do far better than  AMEX.\n\n

  claim to be experts on credit and finances and yet they carry over a credit card
  balance from month to month. Why have 14 credit cards and plan on them for an emergency
  fund? The best way I have personally found and that many of my students of Financial
  Peace University have found is to have a cash emergency fund. A minimum of $1000
  in a cash savings account will do, but a 3-6 month household expenses emergency
  fund will do far better and your life will be much better off for it.\nIf you are
  too cash poor to pay off your credit cards, then you are too poor to even use those
  same credit cards. I have two credit cards, one for personal use and one for business
  use. They both get paid off every month, have no fees, and I don’t really care what
  the interest rate is on them as I have never (As in not one single time since I
  got the cards) carried a balance over from one month to the next.\nAs for me, I
  make a modest income, pay attention to my finances, and I am not a sucker who buys
  everything I see or falls for the store ‘discount’ if I apply for credit. I do live
  quite well all the same. I even plan to have my 15 year mortgage paid off in less
  than half of that amount of time. And I still have a credit score in the 820+ range.\nManaging
  your credit cards better may not work for you, but it certainly does work for many
  of us out here in the real world.\n\n      \n               \n     \n\n   \n     \n

  the same 10% fixed APR cards for over 20 years and don’t have the time to figure

  a 0% interest earnings environment.  We did get a Venture One card when my daughter

  would be a card issued by a predatory issuer – one that markets to people who have
  bad credit with $300 credit limits and a $100 annual fee (with monthly “maintenance”
  fees) and/or issuance fees.\nBeyond those cards, there are only smart cardholders
  and stupid cardholders.  I know because I was married to a stupid cardholder for
  20 years before I finally divorced her.  Early on in our marriage, she got a VISA
  with a $500 credit limit.  Before the ink was dry on her signature, she was in a
  shopping mall – returning hours later with over a dozen pairs of shoes (and remaining
  credit in the single digits).  And when I asked her, “Why so many shoes?” she answered
  (seemingly shocked I’d even asked), “Because they were on sale!”  She maintained
  that attitude for the remainder of our marriage.\nShortly after I divorced her,
  she filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I was handling my debts just fine – until her
  creditors came after me (community property state).  Her debts were so large I was
  forced to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy just to stay afloat.  But in 2011, after
  5 years of on-time payments to my trustee, I emerged from that debt-free.\nImmediately
  after discharge, I applied for and got a secured VISA from my credit union.  And
  after 12 on-time monthly payments on the card, they converted it to an unsecured

  S. Ismore \t  March 13, 2015\n      \n      \n\t  \n\t  \n\n      The only credit
  card I’d consider “evil” would be a card issued by a predatory issuer – one that
  markets to people who have bad credit with $300 credit limits and a $100 annual
  fee (with monthly “maintenance” fees) and/or issuance fees.\nBeyond those cards,
  there are only smart cardholders and stupid cardholders.  I know because I was married
  to a stupid cardholder for 20 years before I finally divorced her.  Early on in
  our marriage, she got a VISA with a $500 credit limit.  Before the ink was dry on
  her signature, she was in a shopping mall – returning hours later with over a dozen
  pairs of shoes (and remaining credit in the single digits).  And when I asked her,
  “Why so many shoes?” she answered (seemingly shocked I’d even asked), “Because they
  were on sale!”  She maintained that attitude for the remainder of our marriage.\nShortly
  after I divorced her, she filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I was handling my debts
  just fine – until her creditors came after me (community property state).  Her debts
  were so large I was forced to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy just to stay afloat.
  \ But in 2011, after 5 years of on-time payments to my trustee, I emerged from that
  debt-free.\nImmediately after discharge, I applied for and got a secured VISA from
  my credit union.  And after 12 on-time monthly payments on the card, they converted
  it to an unsecured card.  A year later in 2013 (7 years from the filing date), all
  Chapter 13 notations dropped away from my credit reports.  And armed with a clean
  credit file and 2 years good history on that one VISA card, I began applying for
  other cards.\nAs of today, I have 14 credit cards with a $34k combined credit limit.

  to build up your credit score. The world works around credit scores. Thats how buisnesses
  trust to do transactions with you. Need a car, you also need a credit score. Need
  a house, or apartment, you also need a credit score. If you pay the card off in
  full each month, you don’t have to deal with interest rates. If you plan on paying
  only the minimum, than you’re going to put yourself in a never ending hole of debt.

  didn’t – you wouldn’t be getting any rewards.  The money is coming from the misuse
  of the cards by others, you are gaining by an industry that is taking intentional
  advantage of others.  It’s like saying people who can’t win gambling in Las Vegas
  shouldn’t go…but if none of the losers went – there would be no Las Vegas to go
  to.\nIf you don’t mind gaining off the backs of those losing (ie: pyramid scheme),

  \     \n      \n\t  \n\t  \n\n      My relationship with Discover spans three decades.
  \ Before the internet, when colleges didn’t charge extra for using a credit card,
  I used to put my tuition on the Discover card.  When the bill came in, I wrote a
  check, put it in the envelope, and wrote a ‘mail by’ date on the envelope — hoping
  my reimbursement would arrive before the check reached Discover.  One month, I got
  a bill with an unusually high balance and interest.  I called to see what was wrong.
  \ As the Discover CSR explained that my check had not been received, I moved a shopping
  list which was covering my unpaid bill.  The CSR said I was a good customer, forgave
  the interest, and gave me an adjusted balance to pay.  They advertise that today,
  but have been doing it for a generation.\nThere’s more, of course.  Extended warranties,
  price protection, cash back, discounted gift cards, and cash back for referrals
  make Discover an attractive charge card.  I think their security is unusual.  When
  my niece went to Europe last year, she was able to use her mother’s credit cards
  without verifying her identity.  When my college student and I used the same Discover
  card at gas stations in two towns within minutes, Discover called, texted, and emailed
  me to contact them regarding suspicious activity.  I appreciate that.\n\n      \n

  to our newsletter to get the latest deals and reviewsUpdated: November 30, 2015Whether
  you’ve got a balance you can’t fully pay off from some big purchases, are looking
  to earn some extra rewards or want to save up for that vacation, getting the right
  credit card can easily save you hundreds or thousands of dollars. With the economy
  on the upswing, right now credit card issuers are courting potential cardholders
  by offering spectacular bonuses, lengthy 0% intro APRs and generous reward programs.Â If
  your credit card falls short, it may be time to upgrade your wallet. Help improve
  your financial situation by taking advantage of these terrific credit card offers
  for 2015 while they’re still available.Best Cash Back Card :Â Blue Cash Preferred
  Card from American ExpressThe winner of our cash back card analysis, Blue Cash Preferred
  Card from American Express (a NextAdvisor advertiser) combines excellent cash back
  rewards with a generous 15-month 0% APR period. You’ll earn 6% cash back at supermarkets
  (on up to $6K in purchases annually), 3% at gas stations and select department stores
  like Sears, JCP, Kohls, Nordstrom and Macy’s, and 1% cash back on all your other
  purchases. Plus, there’s a $150 bonusÂ after spending $1,000 in the first 3 months
  – pretty easy to earn if you use your card like a typical consumer. On top of this
  you can take advantage of its 0% intro APR for the first 15 months on purchases
  and balance transfers (although there is a 3% balance transfer fee). I really like
  this card because of its huge cash back potential. Anyone who spends a lot on groceries
  and gas can really rack up the cash back rewards. And you don’t have to sign up
  quarterly to get your cash back – it’s automatic. There is a $75 annual fee, which
  can be off-putting to some, but honestly if you use your card like a typical consumer
  you should more than earn this back. If you prefer a card with no annual fee, generous
  and straightforward cash back rewards (effective 2% cash back on everything!) and
  a 15-month 0% intro APR period, check out the Citi Double Cash Card. Or to find
  out which cash back card is the best for your spending patterns, use our free Personalized
  Cash Back Calculator.Best Balance Transfer Card: ChaseÂ SlateIf you overdid it on
  some shopping purchases and can’t fully pay off your balance on one or more credit
  cards, ChaseÂ Slate is the card for you.Â  Instead of starting to rack up huge interest
  fees, you can transfer your balances to the Chase Slate. With a 15-month 0% intro
  APR on balance transfers and purchases, as well as no balance transfer fees and
  no annual fee, this card can save you a ton in interest payments. It’s the only
  card we’ve found that offers both no balance transfer fee and a lengthy 0% intro
  APR. And unlike other cards with stellar features like these, people with merely
  good credit (often viewed as a credit score above 660) have a chance to be approved
  for this card. Note that the $0 balance transfer fee is only available for the first
  60 days, but since the reason most people get this card is to transfer their balances
  immediately that shouldn’t be an issue.Â  If you’re in the market for a balance-transfer
  card and aren’t sure which one is best for your situation, take a look at our free
  Balance Transfer CalculatorÂ to determine which card will save you the most.Best
  Low APR Card:Â Citi SimplicityLeading the pack with an outstanding 21-month 0% intro
  APR (the longest we’ve found) and no annual fee or late fees, Citi Simplicity will
  carry you well into 2017 interest-free. You’ll enjoy a 0% intro APR period for 21
  months (that’s over 1.5 years!) on both purchases and balance transfers. Plus you
  won’t pay late fees, penalty rates or an annual fee. Although we encourage our readers
  to pay their cards on time to maintain a healthy credit score, having no late fees
  and no penalty rates is a huge bonus for anyone who may be late with a payment every
  now and then.Â Now is the time to get this card, as any purchases you make will
  be interest-free until 2017. This extended 0% APR period will allow you to pay down
  your balance over time without costing you anything in interest fees. Note this
  card does have a 3% balance transfer fee.Best Travel Card:Â Capital One Venture
  Rewards CardIf you’re saving up for that big vacation or are just a frequent traveler,
  you should strongly consider the Capital One Venture Rewards Card. It starts off
  with a 40,000 point bonus – equal to $400 in travel – after you spend $3,000 in
  the first 90 days. Plus you’ll earn 2 miles for every dollar you spend. That’s 2x
  miles onÂ everyÂ purchase, not just in certain categories or on special deals you
  have to sign up for quarterly. Â Using your earned miles is easy too- just book
  your travel and then redeem your miles as a statement credit against your travel
  costs. You can travel however and wherever you’d like; on any airline, at any hotel
  and with any rental car company (or cruise!). You can also make your travel plans
  however you would like; online, with a travel agent or over the phone. The bottom
  line is that you just need to pay for the travel with this card, it’s as simple
  as that.The Capital One Venture Rewards CardÂ had a very high reward value of $2.00
  for every $100 spent in both the flight and hotel categories in ourÂ Travel Rewards
  Credit Card Analysis. This high value means that your miles are worth more than
  with other popular travel cards on the market today. And an added perk is that when
  you travel outside the U.S. you won’t have to pay foreign transaction fees and it
  hasÂ chip and signature technology. The card does have a $59 annual fee, but it’s
  waived the first year so you’ll have a year to determine if this card is right for
  you before having to pay an annual charge. As an added bonus, the cardÂ was designed
  for people with good to excellent credit, making it a little more accessible than
  cards that require excellent credit.Best Card for Anyone with Good (but not Great)
  Credit: Chase FreedomIf you’re in the market for a credit card but don’t necessarily
  have terrific credit, Chase Freedom might be right up your alley. It was developed
  for those with “Good” credit, which is typically considered to be a credit score
  between 660 and 724 on the FICO credit score scale (if you don’t know your credit
  score you can get it for free). The card doesn’t skimp on extras either – to start
  with you’ll get an enormous $150 intro bonus after spending just $500 in the first
  3 months. You’ll also earn 5% cash back on up to $1,500 in purchases in categories
  that rotate quarterly (note: you need to register each quarter to receive this cash
  back), and 1% back on everything else you buy. Plus there’s no annual fee to worry
  about paying. We really like this card because it has the great features that cards
  typically oriented towards consumers with great credit do, but it’s available to
  those who might have a hit or two on the credit report.Best Card for Students: Discover
  it for StudentsOffering both cash back rewards and a 0% intro APR,Â Discover it
  for Students hits the mark for the college-bound. First off, you’ll earn 5% cash
  back on up to $1,500 in purchases in categories that rotate quarterly and 1% cash
  back on all other purchases. You will need to register online quarterly to receive
  the 5% back, but it’s worth it. Plus, you can take advantage of a 6-month 0% intro
  APR on your purchases. That means you’ll pay no interest at all for the first 6
  months you have this card. We’re not encouraging student debt, but it’s nice to
  know if you put a gift or two and some textbooks on your card you’ll have 6 months
  to pay for them without owing any interest. Just make sure you practice responsible
  use of your card and you’ll be able to build a credit history and boost your credit
  score. And did we mention there is no annual fee AND no foreign transaction fees?
  So if you travel outside the U.S. you won’t pay any additional fees to use your
  card, which can save you a ton of money. Overall this is a great card for any college
  (or grad school) student that combines strong rewards with a 0% intro APR on purchases
  and very reasonable ongoing interest rate.Best Card for Businesses: Ink Cash Business
  CardInk Cash Business Card is a terrific pick for business. It serves up some great
  business-oriented features including generous cash back rewards, a 0% intro APR
  and no annual fee. Plus there’s a $200 bonus after spending $3,000 in the first
  3 months. In addition you’ll earn 5% cash back on purchases at office supply stores
  and on landline, cellular phone, internet and cable TV services (on up to $25,000
  in combined purchases). You’ll also get 2% cash back on the first $25,000 in combined
  purchases at restaurants and gas stations and an unlimited 1% cash back on all other
  purchases. Â On the downside, the 5% and 2% cash back rewards are issued annually
  on your account anniversary, but the 1% cash back rewards are issued monthly. The
  12-month 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers can be very helpful to
  new businesses looking to make some big purchases they don’t need to pay off for
  a year, or to mature businesses who just want to take advantage of paying no interest
  on their purchases and balance transfers for a year.Best Card for Average Credit:

  finance and economic matters.  Robert Campbell C.D.For the person who has to wait
  for a chip … let me see it has nothing to do with you.   Its really between the
  store and the credit card co.    You have to check into the credit card co before
  you apply for one.  American Express has one if you spend 1,000.00 in three months
  you get 300.00 back.  Let me see, is that good, and no yearly charge.  With out
  credit or credit cards, let me see, you have no credit.  That’s just the way things
  are in the present.  Its not how it was 50 years ago.  Lots of cards give you cash
  back,1%,2%,3%,5% and on and on.  Only spend what you can afford and then get cash
  back.   Its a no brainerMusic started playing any time I opened up this website,
  so irritating!After inquiring, my credit union said that they will not be sending
  me a chip card until the end of 2016 !! Is there something illegal about this that
  I have to wait so long for security ??I never carried an AMEX card, or any card
  that asked me to pay a fee for making them money, for that matter.  I did open an
  account with the AMEX Brokerage for a period. Huge mistake!  Money would dissappear
  and reappear in my account for no reason.  They completely bungled reporting dividens
  and sales.  I make sure to throw out anything from AMEX  that appears in my mailbox
  immediately.The best credit card, is NO CREDIT CARD…..\nDad said. ” If you can’t
  pay cash for it, then you probably don’t need it all that bad…”\nI haven’t found
  the need for any credit cards in the nearly 60 years I’ve been on this planet..\nI
  only borrowed money one time back in the Army to purchase a limited Luxury edition\nof
  the 1973 Plymouth Barracuda that some guy was selling for $4,000.00 at the time..\nI
  rushed back on base to the credit union and pulled a $4 500.00 quick cash loan and
  was back at the dealer in less than 30 minutes only to find out the guy sold the
  rare car for $5000.00 while I was at the bank.. They only built 50 of those cars
  and I had planned to put it into storage until I retired and sell 6 at auction for
  as much as it\nwould bring..  About a year ago, I saw that same mint condition model
  Barracuda\nsell at Barret’s Classic Auto Auction for a little over  $150,000.00..
  \ I was so pissed at myself for not going to the bank to begin with,  that I never
  borrowed money for anything ever again…..The fact of the matter is if you can’t
  afford to pay your credit card off each month, then don’t use your credit card.
  \ But if your like me, and pay your card off each month, then your foolish to not
  take advantage of the cash back offers credit cards offer.  I’ve received hundreds
  of dollars each year from cash back for my gas purchases, cell phone bill, and even
  a “1% back on all purchases” card will net you a substantial amount each year.  I’ll
  admit when I was younger I got suckered in by the credit cards, and paid a fair
  amount of interest penalties, but now I’m getting all that money back and more by
  taking advantage of these cash back rewards.  It’s free money folks…SORRY MS. TASHA

  TY  on June 22nd  write e mail me  how you cut your mortgage  in half  the timeI
  cancelled my American Express card because they never supported me when I needed
  it the most.  I had a little accident when driving a rental car and American Express
  said  they couldn’t help me.  The cost of the damages were $840.00.  They did nothing.
  \ They said that they didn’t cover anything.   I don’t know why they always say
  that if  we use their card when renting a car we don’t have to worry about anything.
  \ That is a lie, huge lie.  In two different ocassions I needed them, but they did
  not help.  The second time they didn’t help me it was when I thought that it wasn’t
  worth it to have the Card and cancelled it.  I didn’t trust them anymore.   I don’t
  want anything to do with American Express anymore.American Express has decided not
  to renew its agreement with Costco, that is why they have the new card: damage control!
  Early in 2016 it will go to Citi and I will drop my AmEx card which charges merchants
  too much and as one commenter said, is not accepted as widely, especially in Europe
  where Visa reins supreme.I had an American Express a while back. Too many places
  didn’t accept it. One place that did asked me if I had any other cards that I could
  use. The retailer told me that American Express charges much higher rates and they
  would prefer that I use anything else. I will stick with the Double Cash card. As
  for the others, I have never paid credit card interest so low rates are not a benefit
  for me.Never finance with a credit card unless the rate is less than you are paying
  on a car loan and never buy what you cannot afford to pay for when the bill comes.I’ve
  been doing this for years to beat the interest! Every time you use your card, write
  it in your checkbook and deduct the amount. End of month when statement comes, add
  back the balance and pay the bill in full. If you can’t afford to do this you should
  not have a card! Who can afford those humungus rates?AMEX is and always has been
  a credit rip off.  With the likes of Chase Freedom and even Sam’s Club Master Card,
  \ AMEX cash back is a farce from the get go.  And PAY an annual fee just for the
  card??????    I have 2 Chase Freedom cards, an Ink card, Sam’s Master card and Lowes.
  \  I pay off EVERYTHING each month and my FICO score is 630.  I’ve never paid for
  a credit card.   I have a savings account at Ally Bank, which pays me 1% interest.
  \ YOU can do far better than  AMEX.BS.The best credit card is NO credit card.American

  people claim to be experts on credit and finances and yet they carry over a credit
  card balance from month to month. Why have 14 credit cards and plan on them for
  an emergency fund? The best way I have personally found and that many of my students
  of Financial Peace University have found is to have a cash emergency fund. A minimum
  of $1000 in a cash savings account will do, but a 3-6 month household expenses emergency
  fund will do far better and your life will be much better off for it.If you are
  too cash poor to pay off your credit cards, then you are too poor to even use those
  same credit cards. I have two credit cards, one for personal use and one for business
  use. They both get paid off every month, have no fees, and I don’t really care what
  the interest rate is on them as I have never (As in not one single time since I
  got the cards) carried a balance over from one month to the next.As for me, I make
  a modest income, pay attention to my finances, and I am not a sucker who buys everything
  I see or falls for the store ‘discount’ if I apply for credit. I do live quite well
  all the same. I even plan to have my 15 year mortgage paid off in less than half
  of that amount of time. And I still have a credit score in the 820+ range.Managing
  your credit cards better may not work for you, but it certainly does work for many

  of “Good” by this “Advisor” seems to be how much cashback you get or the period
  of 0% APR. Never is any mention made of the predatory interest rates on balances.
  It is all focused on consumption. O% APR only works if you have the money to pay
  off the balance at the end AND if you spend your time tracking when one 0% ends
  and go through the hassle of getting a new one. I’ve had the same 10% fixed APR
  cards for over 20 years and don’t have the time to figure out which card pays which

  when I asked her, “Why so many shoes?” she answered (seemingly shocked I’d even
  asked), “Because they were on sale!”  She maintained that attitude for the remainder

  a credit score. If you pay the card off in full each month, you don’t have to deal
  with interest rates. If you plan on paying only the minimum, than you’re going to

  relationship with Discover spans three decades.  Before the internet, when colleges
  didn’t charge extra for using a credit card, I used to put my tuition on the Discover
  card.  When the bill came in, I wrote a check, put it in the envelope, and wrote
  a ‘mail by’ date on the envelope — hoping my reimbursement would arrive before the
  check reached Discover.  One month, I got a bill with an unusually high balance
  and interest.  I called to see what was wrong.  As the Discover CSR explained that
  my check had not been received, I moved a shopping list which was covering my unpaid
  bill.  The CSR said I was a good customer, forgave the interest, and gave me an
  adjusted balance to pay.  They advertise that today, but have been doing it for
  a generation.There’s more, of course.  Extended warranties, price protection, cash
  back, discounted gift cards, and cash back for referrals make Discover an attractive
  charge card.  I think their security is unusual.  When my niece went to Europe last
  year, she was able to use her mother’s credit cards without verifying her identity.
