  and began getting organized, it was found that there were no longer any funds available
  to us for paying the cost of hosting our services. That situation was explained
  in the announcement made in this forum posting on November 12, 2010. Therefore,
  the MC began a donation drive in early November. Our financial history from November
  2010 to date is shown in the table below:\n"

  Notes:(a) Donations via the Tides Foundation paid for all costs while Larry Sanger was Editor-in-Chief of Citizendium.(b) Lower cost negotiated by Dan Nessett.
- |
  (c) Includes $51.60 additional cost for time spent moving  Citizendium to new 3-server configuration.
- |
  (d) Further cost lowering for 3-server configuration negotiated by Dan Nessett.
- |
  (e) See Larry Sanger's notes for details concerning Sept. 2011 through January 2012.
- |
  (f) PayPal apparently charges approximately a 4.12% fee on donations made to the Citizendium account. The gross sum of donations during this period was actually $250.00.
- |
  (g) Hayford Peirce replaced Larry Sanger as Treasurer in late January. Additional donations were received but the previous balance of funds had not yet, as of January 31st, been transferred to Hayford's dedicated bank account at Chase maintained solely for the Citizendium account.
- |
  (h) Balance shown includes a donation of 48.25 that was not yet credited by the bank on Feb. 29, 2012.
- |
  (i) Includes a $12.00 bank service charge for having a monthly balance below the minimum required.
- |
  (j) Includes an extra $49.97 for a half-month by the service provider as we begin the migration to a cheaper service. While this is being worked on by the technical staff, we are temporarily paying two monthly charges.
- |
  (k) $319.90 of this total has been contributed by one of our techs as a special extra donation to cover the cost of the old servers while he works to migrate us to a cheaper service. To see the actual normal donations, deduct this amount.
- |2+

- |
  (l) Includes an extra $99.95 for a full month by the service provider as we continue the migration to a cheaper service. While this is being worked on by the technical staff, we are temporarily paying two monthly charges, the original $319.90 plus the extra $99.95.  As stated in Footnote (k), one of our techs is making a special donation to cover the $319.90.  It also includes a $12.00 bank charge for having a monthly balance below the minimum required.
- |
  (m) A number of donations are made towards the end of the month, generally via PayPal. Because it takes several days for our bank account to process PayPal transfers, it is easier for me to do the bookkeeping if I wait until the 4th or 5th of the following month to process the accounts—this way my figures of money in and money out jibe with the bank figures of what is actually in our account.
- |
  (n) The migration to a cheaper service is now complete. The monthly charge by the service provider will be $99.95. This month also includes a $12.00 bank charge for having a monthly balance below the minimum required.
- |2+

- |
  Our fiscal months start and end on the 20th (until Sept. 2011, the 16th) of each month because that is when we pay server costs for the coming month. Beginning with February 2012, however, with a new Treasurer in place, the above charts will reflect a calendar month and not the fiscal month. The figures shown will henceforth reflect the financial situation as of the last calendar day of that month.
- "The MC is making every effort to find some university, or philanthropist or charitable
  non-profit organization to help us with free server facilities or with additional
  funds. However, we have had no success to date. It appears that we must continue
  to raise our own funds by donations. \n"
- |
  What we will urgently need is for a small number of our members to pledge  monthly donations ranging from $5.80 per month to $11.60 per month, as shown just below:
- |2+

- |
  20 members pledging $5.80 per month would raise $116.00 (which would be $112 after deducting PayPal's fee, sufficient for hosting cost) or
- |
  15 members pledging $7.74 per month would raise $116.00 (which would be $112 after deducting PayPal's fee, sufficient for hosting cost) or
- |
  10 members pledging $11.60 per month would raise $116.00 (which would be $112 after deducting PayPal's fee, sufficient for hosting cost)In Southern California, the cost of seeing a movie at the cinema is $15.

  }In late October, 2010, when the Management Council (MC) came into being and began getting organized, it was found that there were no longer any funds available to us for paying the cost of hosting our services. That situation was explained in the announcement made in this forum posting on November 12, 2010. Therefore, the MC began a donation drive in early November. Our financial history from November 2010 to date is shown in the table below:
- |
  (b) Lower cost negotiated by Dan Nessett.
- |
  (c) Includes $51.60 additional cost for time spent moving  Citizendium to new 3-server configuration.
- |
  (d) Further cost lowering for 3-server configuration negotiated by Dan Nessett.
- |
  (e) See Larry Sanger's notes for details concerning Sept. 2011 through January 2012.
- |
  (f) PayPal apparently charges approximately a 4.12% fee on donations made to the Citizendium account. The gross sum of donations during this period was actually $250.00.
- |
  (g) Hayford Peirce replaced Larry Sanger as Treasurer in late January. Additional donations were received but the previous balance of funds had not yet, as of January 31st, been transferred to Hayford's dedicated bank account at Chase maintained solely for the Citizendium account.
- |
  (h) Balance shown includes a donation of 48.25 that was not yet credited by the bank on Feb. 29, 2012.
- |
  (i) Includes a $12.00 bank service charge for having a monthly balance below the minimum required.
- |
  (j) Includes an extra $49.97 for a half-month by the service provider as we begin the migration to a cheaper service. While this is being worked on by the technical staff, we are temporarily paying two monthly charges.
- |
  (k) $319.90 of this total has been contributed by one of our techs as a special extra donation to cover the cost of the old servers while he works to migrate us to a cheaper service. To see the actual normal donations, deduct this amount.
- |2+

- |
  (l) Includes an extra $99.95 for a full month by the service provider as we continue the migration to a cheaper service. While this is being worked on by the technical staff, we are temporarily paying two monthly charges, the original $319.90 plus the extra $99.95.  As stated in Footnote (k), one of our techs is making a special donation to cover the $319.90.  It also includes a $12.00 bank charge for having a monthly balance below the minimum required.
- |
  (m) A number of donations are made towards the end of the month, generally via PayPal. Because it takes several days for our bank account to process PayPal transfers, it is easier for me to do the bookkeeping if I wait until the 4th or 5th of the following month to process the accounts—this way my figures of money in and money out jibe with the bank figures of what is actually in our account.
- |
  (n) The migration to a cheaper service is now complete. The monthly charge by the service provider will be $99.95. This month also includes a $12.00 bank charge for having a monthly balance below the minimum required.
- |
  Our fiscal months start and end on the 20th (until Sept. 2011, the 16th) of each month because that is when we pay server costs for the coming month. Beginning with February 2012, however, with a new Treasurer in place, the above charts will reflect a calendar month and not the fiscal month. The figures shown will henceforth reflect the financial situation as of the last calendar day of that month.
- "The MC is making every effort to find some university, or philanthropist or charitable
  non-profit organization to help us with free server facilities or with additional
  funds. However, we have had no success to date. It appears that we must continue
  to raise our own funds by donations. \n"
- |
  What we will urgently need is for a small number of our members to pledge  monthly donations ranging from $5.80 per month to $11.60 per month, as shown just below:

  In Southern California, the cost of seeing a movie at the cinema is $15.

  when the Management Council (MC) came into being and began getting organized, it
  was found that there were no longer any funds available to us for paying the cost
  of hosting our services. That situation was explained in the announcement made in
  this forum posting on November 12, 2010. Therefore, the MC began a donation drive
  in early November. Our financial history from November 2010 to date is shown in
  the table below:\n\n Financial history as of June 30, 2012\n\n Month\nDonationsduring

  Donations via the Tides Foundation paid for all costs while Larry Sanger was Editor-in-Chief
  of Citizendium.(b) Lower cost negotiated by Dan Nessett.\n(c) Includes $51.60 additional
  cost for time spent moving  Citizendium to new 3-server configuration.\n(d) Further
  cost lowering for 3-server configuration negotiated by Dan Nessett.\n(e) See Larry
  Sanger's notes for details concerning Sept. 2011 through January 2012.\n(f) PayPal
  apparently charges approximately a 4.12% fee on donations made to the Citizendium
  account. The gross sum of donations during this period was actually $250.00.\n(g)
  Hayford Peirce replaced Larry Sanger as Treasurer in late January. Additional donations
  were received but the previous balance of funds had not yet, as of January 31st,
  been transferred to Hayford's dedicated bank account at Chase maintained solely
  for the Citizendium account.\n(h) Balance shown includes a donation of 48.25 that
  was not yet credited by the bank on Feb. 29, 2012.\n(i) Includes a $12.00 bank service
  charge for having a monthly balance below the minimum required.\n(j) Includes an
  extra $49.97 for a half-month by the service provider as we begin the migration
  to a cheaper service. While this is being worked on by the technical staff, we are
  temporarily paying two monthly charges.\n(k) $319.90 of this total has been contributed
  by one of our techs as a special extra donation to cover the cost of the old servers
  while he works to migrate us to a cheaper service. To see the actual normal donations,
  deduct this amount.\n\n(l) Includes an extra $99.95 for a full month by the service
  provider as we continue the migration to a cheaper service. While this is being
  worked on by the technical staff, we are temporarily paying two monthly charges,
  the original $319.90 plus the extra $99.95.  As stated in Footnote (k), one of our
  techs is making a special donation to cover the $319.90.  It also includes a $12.00
  bank charge for having a monthly balance below the minimum required.\n(m) A number
  of donations are made towards the end of the month, generally via PayPal. Because
  it takes several days for our bank account to process PayPal transfers, it is easier
  for me to do the bookkeeping if I wait until the 4th or 5th of the following month
  to process the accounts—this way my figures of money in and money out jibe with
  the bank figures of what is actually in our account.\n(n) The migration to a cheaper
  service is now complete. The monthly charge by the service provider will be $99.95.
  This month also includes a $12.00 bank charge for having a monthly balance below
  the minimum required.\n\nOur fiscal months start and end on the 20th (until Sept.
  2011, the 16th) of each month because that is when we pay server costs for the coming
  month. Beginning with February 2012, however, with a new Treasurer in place, the
  above charts will reflect a calendar month and not the fiscal month. The figures
  shown will henceforth reflect the financial situation as of the last calendar day
  of that month.\nThe MC is making every effort to find some university, or philanthropist
  or charitable non-profit organization to help us with free server facilities or
  with additional funds. However, we have had no success to date. It appears that
  we must continue to raise our own funds by donations. \nWhat we will urgently need
  is for a small number of our members to pledge  monthly donations ranging from $5.80
  per month to $11.60 per month, as shown just below:\n\n20 members pledging $5.80
  per month would raise $116.00 (which would be $112 after deducting PayPal's fee,
  sufficient for hosting cost) or\n15 members pledging $7.74 per month would raise
  $116.00 (which would be $112 after deducting PayPal's fee, sufficient for hosting
  cost) or\n10 members pledging $11.60 per month would raise $116.00 (which would
  be $112 after deducting PayPal's fee, sufficient for hosting cost)In Southern California,
  the cost of seeing a movie at the cinema is $15.\n\nSee also\nDonate\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRetrieved

  late October, 2010, when the Management Council (MC) came into being and began getting
  organized, it was found that there were no longer any funds available to us for
  paying the cost of hosting our services. That situation was explained in the announcement
  made in this forum posting on November 12, 2010. Therefore, the MC began a donation
  drive in early November. Our financial history from November 2010 to date is shown
  in the table below:\n(b) Lower cost negotiated by Dan Nessett.\n(c) Includes $51.60
  additional cost for time spent moving  Citizendium to new 3-server configuration.\n(d)
  Further cost lowering for 3-server configuration negotiated by Dan Nessett.\n(e)
  See Larry Sanger's notes for details concerning Sept. 2011 through January 2012.\n(f)
  PayPal apparently charges approximately a 4.12% fee on donations made to the Citizendium
  account. The gross sum of donations during this period was actually $250.00.\n(g)
  Hayford Peirce replaced Larry Sanger as Treasurer in late January. Additional donations
  were received but the previous balance of funds had not yet, as of January 31st,
  been transferred to Hayford's dedicated bank account at Chase maintained solely
  for the Citizendium account.\n(h) Balance shown includes a donation of 48.25 that
  was not yet credited by the bank on Feb. 29, 2012.\n(i) Includes a $12.00 bank service
  charge for having a monthly balance below the minimum required.\n(j) Includes an
  extra $49.97 for a half-month by the service provider as we begin the migration
  to a cheaper service. While this is being worked on by the technical staff, we are
  temporarily paying two monthly charges.\n(k) $319.90 of this total has been contributed
  by one of our techs as a special extra donation to cover the cost of the old servers
  while he works to migrate us to a cheaper service. To see the actual normal donations,
  deduct this amount.\n\n(l) Includes an extra $99.95 for a full month by the service
  provider as we continue the migration to a cheaper service. While this is being
  worked on by the technical staff, we are temporarily paying two monthly charges,
  the original $319.90 plus the extra $99.95.  As stated in Footnote (k), one of our
  techs is making a special donation to cover the $319.90.  It also includes a $12.00
  bank charge for having a monthly balance below the minimum required.\n(m) A number
  of donations are made towards the end of the month, generally via PayPal. Because
  it takes several days for our bank account to process PayPal transfers, it is easier
  for me to do the bookkeeping if I wait until the 4th or 5th of the following month
  to process the accounts—this way my figures of money in and money out jibe with
  the bank figures of what is actually in our account.\n(n) The migration to a cheaper
  service is now complete. The monthly charge by the service provider will be $99.95.
