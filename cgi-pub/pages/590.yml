- "  Part\r\n"
- "    4: \r\n"
- "    Konrad\r\n"
- "    Zuse's Z1 and Z3 Computers\r\n"
- "  \r\n"
- "  The Z2 Computer\r\n"
- "    Unsatisfied with the reliability of the binary switching metal sheets used
  in the Z1,\r\n"
- "    Konrad Zuse next constructed the Z2 computer. The Z2 used the same type of
  mechanical\r\n"
- "    memory as the Z1, but he used 800 old relays from phone companies to construct
  the\r\n"
- "    arithmetic and control units. The Z2\x92s arithmetic unit consisted of a 16-bit\r\n"
- "    fixed-point engine, because he wanted to test the reliability of relays for
  arithmetic\r\n"
- "    calculations. Unfortunately, photos and plans of the Z2 were destroyed by allied
  air raids\r\n"
- "    during the war. However, the Z2 served its purpose, because it convinced my
  father that\r\n"
- "    relays were indeed reliable, and he subsequently built his Z3 computer completely
  out of\r\n"
- "    relays (600 for the arithmetic unit and 1,800 for the memory and control units).The
  Z3 Computer (1939-1941)\r\n"
- "    Helped by friends and with some small support from the government, Konrad Zuse
  constructed\r\n"
- "    his Z3 machine from 1939 to 1941 in the MethfesselstraÃ\x9Fe 7 in Berlin-Kreuzberg.
  He wanted\r\n"
- "    to use the Z3 to demonstrate that it was possible to build a reliable, freely
  programmable\r\n"
- "    computer based on a binary floating point number and switching system, which
  could be used\r\n"
- "    for very complicated arithmetic calculations. For reliability reasons he used
  relays for\r\n"
- "    the entire machine.\r\n"
- "  \r\n"
- "  \r\n"
- "    Fig.24. The original design of the Z3 \r\n"
- "    drawn by Konrad Zuse in 1939.\r\n"
- "    \r\n"
- "    Fig.25. The Z3 that was rebuilt by \r\n"
- "    Konrad Zuse in 1960/61.\r\n"
- "  \r\n"
- "  The original design of the Z3 is illustrated in Fig.24.\r\n"
- "    Unfortunately no photos of the original Z3 exist, because all documents and
  photographs\r\n"
- "    were destroyed by allied air raids during the Second World War. \r\n"
- "    Konrad Zuse rebuilt the Z3 at\r\n"
- "    his Zuse KG(3) company between 1960 and 1961 (Fig.25)  in\r\n"
- "    order to demonstrate the performance of this machine to justify his patents
  and to show\r\n"
- "    the world his creation (and also to demonstrate the machine for advertising
  purposes).\r\n"
- "    Like the original machine, the rebuilt Z3 is completely constructed from relays.
  The Z3's\r\n"
- "    memory (64 words, each comprising 22 bits) is seen on the left-hand side of
  Fig.25. The\r\n"
- "    console is at the front, while the binary floating point arithmetic unit appears
  on the\r\n"
- "    right-hand side. The Z3 is about five meters long, two meters high, and 80cm
  wide.\r\n"
- "    (3)The Zuse\r\n"
- "    KG (where \"KG\" means a special type of company in the form of a limited\r\n"
- "    partnership) was founded in 1949 in Neukirchen (Kreis HÃ¼nfeld). This is about
  120km north\r\n"
- "    of Frankfurt. \r\n"
- "    In 1957, the Zuse KG was moved\r\n"
- "    to Bad Hersfeld, which lies 15km north of Neukirchen. This move was prompted
  by the lack\r\n"
- "    of space for rooms and the cramped production facilities.\r\n"
- "  \r\n"
- "    \r\n"
- "  Fig.26. Konrad Zuse with the rebuilt Z3 in\r\n"
- "    1961. The memory is \r\n"
- "    on the left (note the \"Z\" logo Z of the Zuse KG company). The arithmetic
  unit\r\n"
- "    with the stepwise relays are on the right, and \r\n"
- "    the console with punch tape reader is on the front left.\r\n"
- "    Fig.27. A page from Konrad \r\n"
- "    Zuse\x92s diary from May 12, 1941, when he presented the working \r\n"
- "    Z3 to scientists in Berlin.\r\n"
- "  \r\n"
- "    \r\n"
- "  It is\r\n"
- "    now undisputed that the Z3 was the first reliable, freely programmable, working
  computer\r\n"
- "    in the world based on a binary floating-point number and switching system.
  In 1941, the Z3\r\n"
- "    contained almost all of the features of a modern computer as defined by John
  von Neumann\r\n"
- "    and his colleagues in 1946 [BURK46].\r\n"
- "    The only exception was the ability to store the program in the memory together
  with the\r\n"
- "    data. Konrad Zuse did not implement this feature in the Z3, because his 64-word
  memory was\r\n"
- "    too small to support this mode of operation. Due to the fact that he wanted
  to calculate\r\n"
- "    thousands of instructions in a meaningful order, he only used the memory to
  store values\r\n"
- "    or numbers.\r\n"
- "  \r\n"
- "  Fig.28. A block diagram of the Z3.\r\n"
- "    Fig.29. The rebuilt Z3 (1961).\r\n"
- "  \r\n"
- "    \r\n"
- "  The block\r\n"
- "    structure of the Z3 is very similar to a modern computer. The Z3 consisted
  of separate\r\n"
- "    units, such as a punch tape reader, control unit, floating-point arithmetic
  unit, and\r\n"
- "    input/output devices. With respect to this theme, Burks et al. [BURK46] wrote
  as late as 1946, \"In as much as the\r\n"
- "    completed device will be a general-purpose computing machine it should contain
  main organs\r\n"
- "    relating to arithmetic, memory-storage, control and connection with the human
  operator. It\r\n"
- "    is intended that the machine be fully automatic in character, i.e. independent
  of the\r\n"
- "    human operator after the computation starts.\" It is important to note that
  the Z3 fully met Burks\x92\r\n"
- "    requirements. Also, the Z3 supported a special operating mode, because the
  Lu\r\n"
- "    instruction stopped the program and activated the input device. The human operator
  could\r\n"
- "    check, among other things, the contents of the Registers R1 and R2 in the arithmetic
  unit,\r\n"
- "    he or she could perform intermediate calculations using the Registers R1 and

  and Work of Konrad Zuse (by Horst Zuse)\r\n  Part\r\n    4: \r\n    Konrad\r\n    Zuse's
  Z1 and Z3 Computers\r\n  \r\n  The Z2 Computer\r\n    Unsatisfied with the reliability
  of the binary switching metal sheets used in the Z1,\r\n    Konrad Zuse next constructed
  the Z2 computer. The Z2 used the same type of mechanical\r\n    memory as the Z1,
  but he used 800 old relays from phone companies to construct the\r\n    arithmetic
  and control units. The Z2\x92s arithmetic unit consisted of a 16-bit\r\n    fixed-point
  engine, because he wanted to test the reliability of relays for arithmetic\r\n    calculations.
  Unfortunately, photos and plans of the Z2 were destroyed by allied air raids\r\n
  \   during the war. However, the Z2 served its purpose, because it convinced my
  father that\r\n    relays were indeed reliable, and he subsequently built his Z3
  computer completely out of\r\n    relays (600 for the arithmetic unit and 1,800
  for the memory and control units).The Z3 Computer (1939-1941)\r\n    Helped by friends
  and with some small support from the government, Konrad Zuse constructed\r\n    his
  Z3 machine from 1939 to 1941 in the MethfesselstraÃ\x9Fe 7 in Berlin-Kreuzberg.
  He wanted\r\n    to use the Z3 to demonstrate that it was possible to build a reliable,
  freely programmable\r\n    computer based on a binary floating point number and
  switching system, which could be used\r\n    for very complicated arithmetic calculations.
  For reliability reasons he used relays for\r\n    the entire machine.\r\n  \r\n
  \ \r\n    Fig.24. The original design of the Z3 \r\n    drawn by Konrad Zuse in
  1939.\r\n    \r\n    Fig.25. The Z3 that was rebuilt by \r\n    Konrad Zuse in 1960/61.\r\n
  \ \r\n  The original design of the Z3 is illustrated in Fig.24.\r\n    Unfortunately
  no photos of the original Z3 exist, because all documents and photographs\r\n    were
  destroyed by allied air raids during the Second World War. \r\n    Konrad Zuse rebuilt
  the Z3 at\r\n    his Zuse KG(3) company between 1960 and 1961 (Fig.25)  in\r\n    order
  to demonstrate the performance of this machine to justify his patents and to show\r\n
  \   the world his creation (and also to demonstrate the machine for advertising
  purposes).\r\n    Like the original machine, the rebuilt Z3 is completely constructed
  from relays. The Z3's\r\n    memory (64 words, each comprising 22 bits) is seen
  on the left-hand side of Fig.25. The\r\n    console is at the front, while the binary
  floating point arithmetic unit appears on the\r\n    right-hand side. The Z3 is
  about five meters long, two meters high, and 80cm wide.\r\n    (3)The Zuse\r\n    KG
  (where \"KG\" means a special type of company in the form of a limited\r\n    partnership)
  was founded in 1949 in Neukirchen (Kreis HÃ¼nfeld). This is about 120km north\r\n
  \   of Frankfurt. \r\n    In 1957, the Zuse KG was moved\r\n    to Bad Hersfeld,
  which lies 15km north of Neukirchen. This move was prompted by the lack\r\n    of
  space for rooms and the cramped production facilities.\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  Fig.26.
  Konrad Zuse with the rebuilt Z3 in\r\n    1961. The memory is \r\n    on the left
  (note the \"Z\" logo Z of the Zuse KG company). The arithmetic unit\r\n    with
  the stepwise relays are on the right, and \r\n    the console with punch tape reader
  is on the front left.\r\n    Fig.27. A page from Konrad \r\n    Zuse\x92s diary
  from May 12, 1941, when he presented the working \r\n    Z3 to scientists in Berlin.\r\n
  \ \r\n    \r\n  It is\r\n    now undisputed that the Z3 was the first reliable,
  freely programmable, working computer\r\n    in the world based on a binary floating-point
  number and switching system. In 1941, the Z3\r\n    contained almost all of the
  features of a modern computer as defined by John von Neumann\r\n    and his colleagues
  in 1946 [BURK46].\r\n    The only exception was the ability to store the program
  in the memory together with the\r\n    data. Konrad Zuse did not implement this
  feature in the Z3, because his 64-word memory was\r\n    too small to support this
  mode of operation. Due to the fact that he wanted to calculate\r\n    thousands
  of instructions in a meaningful order, he only used the memory to store values\r\n
  \   or numbers.\r\n  \r\n  Fig.28. A block diagram of the Z3.\r\n    Fig.29. The
  rebuilt Z3 (1961).\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  The block\r\n    structure of the Z3 is very
  similar to a modern computer. The Z3 consisted of separate\r\n    units, such as
  a punch tape reader, control unit, floating-point arithmetic unit, and\r\n    input/output
  devices. With respect to this theme, Burks et al. [BURK46] wrote as late as 1946,
  \"In as much as the\r\n    completed device will be a general-purpose computing
  machine it should contain main organs\r\n    relating to arithmetic, memory-storage,
  control and connection with the human operator. It\r\n    is intended that the machine
  be fully automatic in character, i.e. independent of the\r\n    human operator after
  the computation starts.\" It is important to note that the Z3 fully met Burks\x92\r\n
  \   requirements. Also, the Z3 supported a special operating mode, because the Lu\r\n
  \   instruction stopped the program and activated the input device. The human operator
  could\r\n    check, among other things, the contents of the Registers R1 and R2
  in the arithmetic unit,\r\n    he or she could perform intermediate calculations
  using the Registers R1 and R2, then the\r\n    operator could continue running the
  program.\r\n  \r\n  Previous Section    Return to Index    Next Section\r\n   \r\n
