  CLASSIFICATION OFTHE SCIENCES
- |2+

- |
  The aim of every classification is to establish order in
- |
  things and in thought. When this operation is applied
- |
  in the sciences at a given time in their evolution, it
- |
  provides a faithful though provisional picture of the
- |
  scientific knowledge at that time. By enabling us to
- |
  take such an inventory of our knowledge, classification
- |
  provides a sort of spatiotemporal cross section of the
- |
  sphere of ideas and culture of a given period. The value
- |2
   of classification, however, goes beyond a mere inven-
- |
  tory or “table of contents,” no matter how complete.
- |
  The very fact that classification appeals to logical
- |
  criteria which may possibly be subjective or objective
- |
  in nature gives us an initial idea of the obstacles con-
- |
  fronting the classifier, difficulties scarcely encountered
- |
  in the preparation of a catalogue, properly so called.
- |
  Consequently, a well conducted effort at surveying the
- |
  history of the classification of the sciences may be
- |
  valuable in leading us to discover the connections and
- |
  analogies existing among the different fields of knowl-
- |
  edge at a given time, and within the context of a
- |
  particular type of civilization. However, history of any
- |
  sort is not a static phenomenon, but follows an evolu-
- |
  tionary course. We are obliged therefore to study the
- |
  sciences and their classification considered essentially
- |
  as an historical process subject to continuous develop-
- |
  ment. We shall thus see the appearance of the great
- |
  currents of ideas which have sometimes dominated
- |
  many centuries and we can seek what is less apparent,
- |
  namely, the structure underlying these ideas.
- |
  We can already discern among the ancients this need
- |
  to classify and discover relationships and hidden con-
- |
  nections in order to obtain a total view of reality and
- |
  to explain the mechanism of the universe. Take
- |
  Pythagoras, for example, whose life was described by
- |
  Porphyry and Iamblichus, and whose teaching was
- |
  addressed primarily to those initiated in his circle.
- |
  According to Pythagoras, geometry, arithmetic (theory
- |
  of numbers), and music (acoustics) lead to the discovery
- |
  of the secrets of number and harmony; only the sage
- |
  by starting with these principles is able to reconstruct
- |
  reality (Stobaeus, Florilège, I, 62-63). Through Archy-
- |
  tas of Tarentum, Plato had been introduced to the
- |
  Pythagorean method, as can be seen in several places
- |
  in the Timaeus, the Platonic dialogue on which Proclus
- |
  wrote a commentary in four books.
- |
  Plato thought that ideas should be ordered according
- |
  to their extension (denotation) in inverse relationship
- |
  to their intension (comprehension): by starting from
- |
  general and vague ideas, one should end up with more
- |
  specific and clearer ideas. This dichotomy and progres-
- |
  sive division of each idea into those ideas immediately
- |
  below it, is expounded in the Republic. There is really
- |
  a hierarchy made up of genus (γένη) and species (εἴδη),
- |
  but for Plato, genus and species are inseparable. Be-
- |
  sides, Plato applies the term mathemata (μαθήματα)
- |
  not only to the exact sciences but also to the technical
- |
  and mechanical arts and to the liberal arts like music
- |
  and gymnastics, that is to say, to all the disciplines
- |
  capable of educating a man. However, among thesemathemata Plato bestows a privileged place on the
- |
  sciences properly called mathematical. We must re-
- |
  member that geometry, arithmetic, astrology (in the   Page 463, Volume 1
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  sense of astronomy), and music belonged typically to
- |
  Hellenic culture. In the Laws, Plato returns to this
- |
  question in order to remind the reader that the first
- |
  three sciences must be acquired by every free man
- |
  (Laws VII, 817E).
- |
  It was not until Aristotle that we find the separation
- |
  between species and genus, which was to become the
- |
  basis of Aristotelian logic. The species is the specifica-
- |
  tion of the genus; both appear in deduction, induction,
- |
  and in the theory of definition (per genus proximum
- |
  et differentiam specificam). We find this hierarchy again
- |
  in all the later types of classification, however, the
- |
  criterion of division by species and genus was later
- |
  shown to be inadequate; for example, according to the
- |
  theory of evolution zoological and botanical species
- |
  have no stability. We must therefore take into account
- |
  other criteria: such as the contrasting criteria of objec-
- |
  tivity and subjectivity, criteria varying with respect to
- |
  method, foundations, aims, and so forth. But, returning
- |
  to Aristotle, who is generally more systematic in his
- |
  ordering of the sciences, we note that for him there
- |
  exist only three large groups of sciences: (1) theoretical
- |
  sciences (physics and philosophy); (2) practical sciences
- |
  (ethics and politics); (3) poetic sciences (aesthetics).
- |
  We also note that for him all reality is knowable
- |
  only through classification, but we must not forget also
- |
  that for Aristotle all sciences have to be subordinate
- |
  to philosophy. It is true that Aristotle's Physics comes
- |
  exactly between mathematics and theology and is pre-
- |
  ceded by Logic, which is the structure of science and
- |
  also the science of structure. Physics is followed by
- |
  Aristotle's treatises On the Heavens (De caelo), andMeterology. This plan is in conformity with the prin-
- |
  ciples of classification which appear in several places
- |
  of his work. We note three in particular. In Aristotle'sTopics we read that science “is indeed called specula-
- |
  tive, practical, and poetic, the differences depending
- |
  on how each is related respectively to the theory, the
- |
  production, and the action of something” (Topics VI,
- |
  6, 145a 15). In the Nicomachean Ethics (VI, 3-5) there
- |
  is a brief passage concerning art (technē), science
- |
  (epistemē), wisdom (phronēsis), philosophy (sophia), and
- |
  intelligence (nous). There are longer passages in theMetaphysics.
- |2+

- |
  “Physics is the theoretical science of material objects
- |
  in motion...; mathematics is a contemplative sci-
- |
  ence, though certain mathematical entities are station-
- |
  ary” (VI, 1026a). Then farther on: “Theoretical sci-
- |
  ences come before the practical ones and philosophy
- |
  before the theoretical sciences...; motion exists only
- |
  in relation to quantity, quality, and place” (XI, 7
- |
  passim; XI, 12, 1068b).
- |
  Among Aristotle's pupils, Demetrius of Phalerum
- |
  was a great encyclopedic mind and one of the orga
- |
  nizers of the library in Alexandria, the center of scien-
- |
  tists and philosophers. He deserves mention here for
- |
  having introduced divisions and subdivisions of knowl-
- |
  edge with the aim of permitting specialization in a
- |
  given field of study. In the second century B.C., there
- |
  was Posidonius of Apamea, the Stoic and polymath;
- |
  he was later in Rome and Cadiz; his work also included
- |
  all fields of learning, though unfortunately only some
- |
  few fragments of his work are extant.
- |
  In the following century, in Rome, Marcus Terentius
- |
  Varro expounded a whole program of studies extending
- |
  from grammar to architecture (Varro was contem-
- |
  porary with Vitruvius), the program answering certain
- |
  practical needs without being devoid, however, of a
- |
  certain idealism. In Varro's Disciplinarum (ca. 50 B.C.),
- |
  which may be regarded as the first illustrated encyclo-
- |
  pedia, we find the following classification: grammar,
- |
  dialectic, rhetoric, geometry, arithmetic, astrology,
- |
  music, medicine, and architecture. It reflects perfectly
- |
  the genius of his time and especially of his people;
- |
  it owes nothing, in any case, to Aristotelian ideas. With
- |
  respect to special disciplines, mention must be made
- |
  of the works of the physician A. Cornelius Celsus and
- |
  the Natural History of Pliny the Elder in 37 books,
- |
  completed in A.D. 77, a true testament of ancient sci-
- |
  ence and a model of classification within a branch
- |
  of science. Pliny's work has come down to us in its
- |
  entirety.
- |
  We know that the Arabs preserved Creek science,
- |
  that they translated the works of the ancients, added
- |
  commentaries, and not only left the imprint of their
- |
  genius on these commentaries, but made some original
- |
  contributions in every field of knowledge. Greek sci-
- |
  ence, enriched by the Arabs' contribution, was intro-
- |
  duced by the Moors into Spain, and then proceeded
- |
  to penetrate other European countries. Within Islam
- |
  there appeared during the seventh century the first
- |
  seeds of the new sciences which were essentially reli-
- |
  gious; then a distinction was made between Arabic
- |
  sciences (such as poetry and the art of oratory) and
- |
  foreign sciences (astronomy, medicine, mathematics).
- |
  Most of the “foreign sciences” came from the Greek
- |
  heritage, thanks to the Syrian translations; there were
- |
  also works translated from the Sanskrit via the Pali.
- |
  A very distinct effort at classification is discernible
- |
  among the Arabs, for example, in Al Farabi and
- |
  Avicenna (Ibn Sina), an effort which had been preceded
- |
  by the work of systematization. To be remembered are
- |
  the names of Djahiz (`Amr Ibn Bahr Jahiz), an Iraquian
- |
  scientist (died 868), author of a bestiary, or Book of
- |
  Animals in seven volumes, in which we meet subjects
- |
  going beyond the scope of the title. His contemporary
- |
  Ibn Qutaibah wrote a treatise, Adab al Katib, contain-
- |
  ing an essay on classification (in the introduction).

- |
  In China and in India throughout the centuries, there
- |
  are examples of classification in encyclopedic works.
- |
  In China such works always enjoyed, more than else-
- |
  where, an important role in education and in prepara-
- |
  tion for taking examinations for official positions. In
- |
  the Han dynasty (second century B.C.) appeared a
- |
  dictionary entitled Erh-ya; it was probably composed
- |
  earlier. This work is divided into nineteen categories:
- |
  explanation of definitions, definitions of concepts, ex-
- |
  planation of words, degrees of affinity; then come the
- |
  art of construction, tools, music, heaven, earth, hills,
- |
  mountains, water, fields, forests, insects, fish, birds,
- |
  quadrupeds, and domestic animals. Notice that this
- |
  series is not devoid of a certain structure. During the
- |
  same period there also appeared a classification in the
- |
  dictionary of Liu Hsi (or Liu Hsieh), the Shih-ming
- |2+

- |
  or interpretation of concepts. The criterion applied is
- |
  the way of passing from heaven to earth and from earth
- |
  to man; it includes twenty-seven divisions. In the Ming
- |
  era, which marked the first commercial contacts with
- |
  the Occident, the number of schools and candidates
- |
  taking examinations increased rapidly; in 1615, Mei
- |
  Ying-tsu published the Tzu-hui, a dictionary which
- |
  revolutionized the arrangement of words by ordering
- |
  them on the basis of graphic analogies. A century later,
- |
  by taking the Tzu-hui as a model, a new dictionary
- |
  was published, the K'ang-hsi tzu-tien, (dictionary of
- |
  the era of “splendid peace”) which serves as the basis
- |
  of modern Chinese encyclopedias.
- |
  In India, works embracing the whole of knowledge
- |
  or bearing on a particular field have been traditional
- |
  since ancient times. The language used in the beginning
- |
  was nearly always Sanskrit. In the first centuries A.D.
- |
  there were the Dharmaśāstra (Treatises of the Correct
- |
  Order) in which there are ideas on cosmology, social
- |
  rules, human functions, and law. In the eleventh cen-
- |
  tury, the encyclopedic work of the Sanskrit author
- |
  from Kashmir, Abinavagupta, and in the twelfth cen-
- |
  tury Somadeva's work on the arts and techniques are
- |
  worthy of notice. At the beginning of the nineteenth
- |
  century, encyclopedic works multiplied constantly, at
- |
  first in Sanskrit, then in the majority of the languages
- |
  of India: Hindi (the government's language), Bengali,
- |
  Marath, Gujrāti, Tamil, Malayālam, Telugu, Kannada.
- |
  Returning to the Occident, more precisely to the
- |
  medieval Christian Occident, we find that for many
- |
  centuries the regular study of the Quadrivium (arith-
- |
  metic, music, geometry, and astronomy) was a required
- |
  preliminary to the study of philosophy and theology.
- |
  This rule, followed in Paris as well as in Oxford, had
- |
  been the practice in Constantinople where a new
- |
  branch of science was added to the list, namely, the
- |
  art of “horse-matters” or veterinary art. In Paris,
- |
  among the first masters of the Abbey of Saint-Victor,
- |2
   which was one of the famous Parisian schools of the
- |
  twelfth century, was the important scholar, Hugh of
- |
  Saint-Victor. His chief work, the Didascalicon, contains
- |
  a classification of the sciences and is a typical example
- |
  of the cultural level of the high Middle Ages. The
- |
  following are its main divisions, resulting from philos-
- |
  ophy's encompassing all knowledge. Philosophy is sub-
- |
  divided into: (1) theoretical sciences (mathematics,
- |
  physics, theology); (2) practical sciences (private or
- |
  public); (3) mechanical sciences (navigation, agricul-
- |
  ture, hunting, medicine, theater); (4) logic, including
- |
  grammar and rhetoric. There is obviously a certain
- |
  arbitrariness in the system proposed here, but nautical
- |
  knowledge emerges as a new branch of science. Fur-
- |
  thermore, cartography is soon to make its appearance—
- |
  well before the era of great sea voyages and discoveries.
- |
  As for Hugh of Saint-Victor, a curious mind and good
- |
  pedagogue, he gave his readers the following advice:
- |
  learn everything, you will see later that nothing is
- |
  superfluous (omnia disce, videbis postea nihil esse
- |
  superfluum).
- |
  In the thirteenth century, we see how Roger Bacon,
- |
  continuing the work of Robert Grosseteste, placed
- |
  mathematics at the base of the sciences of nature. His
- "classification contains four large classes: (1) grammar \n"
- |
  and logic; (2) mathematics; (3) philosophy of nature;
- |
  and (4) metaphysics and ethics.
- |
  We must now observe that the essays on classification
- |
  mentioned above, though they provide us with a fairly
- |
  faithful picture of the knowledge of an era and in a
- |
  given country, have yet failed to yield any satisfactory
- |
  connection among the scientific disciplines; they fail
- |
  even more to furnish a theory of knowledge internal
- |
  to the sciences which would enable us to take into
- |
  account the great currents of thought in the sciences.
- |
  It was not until the time of the Renaissance, more
- |
  specifically, the end of the Renaissance, that a system
- |
  of classification appeared which for the first time is
- |
  logical, organic, and firmly structured with respect to
- |
  aims, objects, and different groups of phenomena. It
- |
  was the system proposed by Francis Bacon in his work
- |
  on the worth and advancement of the sciences (De
- |
  dignitate et augmentis scientiarum). The author applied
- |
  psychological criteria, namely, Memory, Imagination,
- |
  and Reason: history is constructed by memory, and may
- |
  be either Civil History or Natural History; poetry flows
- |
  from the fancy or imagination, and may be narrative,
- |
  dramatic, or parabolic; finally, philosophy, which re-
- |
  sults from the use of reason, is divided into the sciences
- |
  of the divine, of nature, and of man. The system of
- |
  the classification of the sciences and arts by Francis
- |
  Bacon was adopted, with a few modifications, by
- |
  d'Alembert in the Discours préliminaire des éditeurs
- |
  de l'Encyclopédie.

- |
  Locke and Leibniz make a clear distinction between
- |
  natural sciences (of bodies and of the mind) and moral
- |
  sciences (history and ethics). Locke introduced Semi-
- |
  otic or the science of language, and Leibniz gave logic
- |
  a preponderant place. From the eighteenth century on,
- |
  most philosophers and scientists who dealt with clas-
- |
  sification divided the sciences into two fundamental
- |
  kinds: sciences of nature and sciences of the mind.
- |
  Towards the middle of the nineteenth century there
- |
  appeared the system of Auguste Comte, which is based
- |
  on a series of decreasing generality and increasing
- |
  complexity of subject matter in the following order:
- |
  mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology,
- |
  sociology. The order of the classes is inherently linear,
- |
  and has several weak points. Comte pictured in it a
- |
  “natural logic” which has nothing to do with the mod-
- |
  ern idea of axiomatic logic. He excluded the study of
- |
  a spiritual or purely mental subject (it is true that he
- |
  later added morals and introspective data); he included
- |
  among the abstract sciences the concrete science of
- |
  astronomy. His system was reshaped by T. Whittaker
- |
  who separated the two orders of objective (physical)
- |
  and subjective (psychological) sciences; unfortunately,
- |
  this separation fails to take account of the historical
- |
  development of the sciences.
- |
  It was the great physicist A. M. Ampère who pro-
- |
  posed to make a comprehensive table of all the fields
- |
  of science. In his first table, Ampère separated all
- |
  knowledge into two domains and divided each domain
- |
  into subdomains and branches; the first domain com-
- |
  prised the cosmological sciences and the second the
- |
  sciences of the mind. In his second table, each branch
- |
  is divided into sub-branches and into the primary sci-
- |
  ences. In a third and final classification, he divided each
- |
  science of the first order into sciences of the second
- |
  and third orders, thus producing a sort of binary system
- |
  which provided a total of 27 = 128 names of disci-
- |
  plines. Ampère's system based on the content of the
- |
  sciences, possesses a very dynamic internal structure;
- |
  it takes into account the historical relations among
- |
  different domains and it remains the most complete
- |
  inventory of scientific knowledge for the mid-
- |
  nineteenth century.
- |
  In 1851, A. A. Cournot worked out a system which
- |
  introduced a separation between structural laws and
- |
  historical criteria in all their forms by employing three
- |
  great series of sciences, a theoretical, an historical, and
- |
  a practical series, each composed of the following kinds
- |
  of science: mathematical, physical, biological, mental
- |
  or symbolical, and political. Every branch of science
- |
  has its place in one of the three times five boxes in
- |
  columns. This is clearly an advance on Comte's system
- |
  in particular, even though, here again, logic remains
- |
  a difficult science to place satisfactorily. (The question
- |2
   can again be raised whether each science does not have
- |
  its own axiomatic structure or whether there might not
- |
  be a common axiomatic structure underlying all the
- |
  sciences.)
- |
  Not long after Cournot, Herbert Spencer started
- |
  from the assumption that all knowledge varies with
- |
  the object, and he classified the sciences according to
- |
  their degree of abstraction in relation to the object.
- |
  He thus obtained a linear series going from the abstract
- |
  to the concrete, in which series there is the following
- |
  order of succession: the abstract sciences, like logic and
- |
  mathematics which are concerned with the form in
- |
  which phenomena appear; the abstract-concrete sci-
- |
  ences, like mechanics, physics, and chemistry which
- |
  investigate the causes of these phenomena; and, finally,
- |
  the concrete sciences which are interested only in
- |
  results. There is a striking similarity between this divi-
- |
  sion and the one in the passage from Aristotle's Topics
- |2+

- |
  quoted above.
- |
  It is in the Manuel du libraire et de l'amateur de
- |
  livres (“Bookseller's and Book-Lover's Manual”) of
- |
  Jacques-Charles Brunet, and exactly in the introduction
- |
  to Volume 6 (5th ed. 1865), that we find the first insight
- |
  into a historical classification. The author examines
- |
  many systems, including Konrad Gesner's, that of the
- |
  Parisian publishers at the time of the Revolution, and
- |
  Ampère's.
- |
  Several German and British philosophers and scien-
- |
  tists dealt with the same problem of classification.
- |
  Besides Schopenhauer, who distinguished between
- |
  empirical (a posteriori) sciences and pure (a priori)
- |
  sciences, there were Hegel, Helmholtz, Wilhelm
- |
  Dilthey, Hugo Münsterberg, and later the psychologists
- |
  Alfred Adler and Wilhelm Wundt. Wundt drew a sharp
- |
  contrast between the sciences of the real and formal
- |
  sciences. The chemist and Nobel laureate Wilhelm
- |
  Ostwald divided the sciences into formal, physical, and
- |
  biological. Paul Tillich considered three kinds: sciences
- |
  of thought or the ideal, of being or the real, and of
- |
  the mind or normative sciences. Among the British
- |
  writers, classifications were made by Jeremy Bentham,
- |
  John Stuart Mill, Karl Pearson, and Franklin H. Gid-
- |
  dings. The American scientist and philosopher Charles
- |
  S. Peirce (son of the mathematician and astronomer
- |
  Benjamin Peirce) classified the sciences after investi-
- |
  gating and writing on logic, psychology, mathematics,
- |
  astronomy, optics, chemistry, and even technology.
- |
  Peirce emphasized methods of inquiry in two essays
- |
  “The Fixation of Belief” and “How To Make Our Ideas
- |
  Clear” (Popular Science Monthly, 1877-78), which
- |
  mark the beginning of American pragmatism, though
- |
  he later preferred the term “pragmaticism” (as ex-
- |
  plained in the article “Pragmatism” in this Dictionary).
- |
  Peirce's trichotomous classification placed Sciences of   Page 466, Volume 1
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Discovery first, followed by Sciences of Review and
- |
  Practical Sciences in a descending order of importance.
- |
  Sciences of Discovery included Mathematics (of logic,
- |
  of discrete series, of continua and pseudo-continua),
- |
  Philosophy (phenomenology, normative science, meta-
- |
  physics), and Idioscopy (physical and psychical sci-
- |
  ences). Peirce had a low opinion of Comte's and Spen-
- |
  cer's attempts at synthesis which fell under Sciences
- |
  of Review, and had even a lower opinion of the Practi-
- |
  cal Sciences which included a motley array of items
- |
  such as etiquette, paper-making, wine tasting, etc.
- |
  (Peirce, I, 77-137).
- |
  In 1920, Adrien Naville's Classification des sciences
- |2+

- |
  appeared, based not on nomenclature, strictly speaking,
- |
  but on the leading ideas of the principal groups of
- |
  sciences and their interrelations. Naville separated
- |
  three great classes of science: Theorematics, science of
- |
  laws; History, science of facts; and Canonics, science
- |
  of normative rules. These three classes provide answers
- |
  to three questions, respectively: What is possible?
- |
  What is real? What is good? To Naville the science
- |
  of laws (nomology) is fundamental. A law is a condi-
- |
  tionally necessary relationship; law exists wherever
- |
  resemblance dominates the scene. Hence, science must
- |
  be concerned with general facts, thus recalling the
- |
  statement of Marcelin Berthelot (1827-1907) in the
- |
  Preface to the Grande Encyclopédie (p. v): “The classi-
- |
  fication of general facts is the classification of the
- |
  sciences.”
- |
  In the first class considered by Naville, following
- |
  nomology are mathematics, physics, chemistry, somatic
- |
  biology, psychology, and sociology. Natural history, the
- |
  theory of evolution, and human geography belong to
- |
  the second class. The sciences of normative rules are
- |
  the work of the arts and of everything concerned with
- |
  the beautiful, the true, and the useful for society as
- |
  well as for the individual.
- |
  Among recent thinkers preoccupied with the prob-
- |
  lem of classification is the Soviet writer Bonifatii M.
- |
  Kedrov whose system is a closed, cyclical, and tight
- |
  structure based on principles of objectivity, subordi-
- |
  nation, and transition from lower to higher forms. The
- |
  psychologist Jean Piaget has on several occasions in-
- |
  vestigated classification, its history, and its importance
- |
  for the theory of knowledge. He has emphasized the
- |
  increasing interpenetration of all the branches of
- |
  knowledge, the role of linguistic structuralism, and the
- |
  operational theory of intelligence. The system which
- |
  he has proposed is not circular or closed, and even
- |
  less a linear one, but rather takes the form of a con-
- |
  stantly growing spiral. According to Piaget, the
- |
  subject-object opposition and dualism must be elimi-
- |
  nated, for there is a constant interaction and mutual
- |
  exchange between the two.
- |2+

- |2
   The object is known only through actions of the subject
- |
  and the subject is known only through the relations it has
- |
  to objects, from which the twofold consequence is that in
- |
  order to ground logic and mathematics we must really go
- |
  back in one form or another to the subject, and in order
- |
  to construct a science of the subject we must go back to
- |
  biology, hence also to physics and mathematics
- |2+

- |
  (Piaget, p.
- |
  1159).
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Lately a leading role has been assigned to language,
- |
  to its mathematical structure, its axiomatic logic of
- |
  grammatical categories, and to the logic of binary
- |
  relations in linguistics. The linguistic problem is tied
- |
  to the automatic (computerized) treatment of “infor-
- |
  mation,” which is a matter of interest not only to
- |
  philologists, philosophers, and psychologists but
- |
  equally as much to mathematicians, cybernetic theo-
- |
  rists, and engineers. Logic, which has only with great
- |
  difficulty found its place in the classification of the
- |
  sciences, is not the sole basis of structural linguistics,
- |
  for the latter depends on the psychology of form
- |
  (Gestalttheorie) and on topology and graphs. Starting
- |
  with language everything seems to converge on the
- |
  unity of knowledge. This advance towards unity should
- |
  perhaps be, after all, the primary aim of a new scien-
- |
  tific humanism. A classification of the sciences which
- |
  is free from the subject-object dualism and from an
- |
  enslaving chainwork of values, and which takes into
- |
  account the profound, intimate, and reciprocal rela-
- |
  tionships among all disciplines, would be the only
- |
  classification fit to instruct us about the present state
- |
  of our scientific knowledge.

  OFTHE SCIENCES\n\nThe aim of every classification is to establish order in\nthings
  and in thought. When this operation is applied\nin the sciences at a given time
  in their evolution, it\nprovides a faithful though provisional picture of the\nscientific
  knowledge at that time. By enabling us to\ntake such an inventory of our knowledge,
  classification\nprovides a sort of spatiotemporal cross section of the\nsphere of
  ideas and culture of a given period. The value\n of classification, however, goes
  beyond a mere inven-\ntory or “table of contents,” no matter how complete.\nThe
  very fact that classification appeals to logical\ncriteria which may possibly be
  subjective or objective\nin nature gives us an initial idea of the obstacles con-\nfronting
  the classifier, difficulties scarcely encountered\nin the preparation of a catalogue,
  properly so called.\nConsequently, a well conducted effort at surveying the\nhistory
  of the classification of the sciences may be\nvaluable in leading us to discover
  the connections and\nanalogies existing among the different fields of knowl-\nedge
  at a given time, and within the context of a\nparticular type of civilization. However,
  history of any\nsort is not a static phenomenon, but follows an evolu-\ntionary
  course. We are obliged therefore to study the\nsciences and their classification
  considered essentially\nas an historical process subject to continuous develop-\nment.
  We shall thus see the appearance of the great\ncurrents of ideas which have sometimes
  dominated\nmany centuries and we can seek what is less apparent,\nnamely, the structure
  underlying these ideas.\nWe can already discern among the ancients this need\nto
  classify and discover relationships and hidden con-\nnections in order to obtain
  a total view of reality and\nto explain the mechanism of the universe. Take\nPythagoras,
  for example, whose life was described by\nPorphyry and Iamblichus, and whose teaching
  was\naddressed primarily to those initiated in his circle.\nAccording to Pythagoras,
  geometry, arithmetic (theory\nof numbers), and music (acoustics) lead to the discovery\nof
  the secrets of number and harmony; only the sage\nby starting with these principles
  is able to reconstruct\nreality (Stobaeus, Florilège, I, 62-63). Through Archy-\ntas
  of Tarentum, Plato had been introduced to the\nPythagorean method, as can be seen
  in several places\nin the Timaeus, the Platonic dialogue on which Proclus\nwrote
  a commentary in four books.\nPlato thought that ideas should be ordered according\nto
  their extension (denotation) in inverse relationship\nto their intension (comprehension):
  by starting from\ngeneral and vague ideas, one should end up with more\nspecific
  and clearer ideas. This dichotomy and progres-\nsive division of each idea into
  those ideas immediately\nbelow it, is expounded in the Republic. There is really\na
  hierarchy made up of genus (γένη) and species (εἴδη),\nbut for Plato, genus and
  species are inseparable. Be-\nsides, Plato applies the term mathemata (μαθήματα)\nnot
  only to the exact sciences but also to the technical\nand mechanical arts and to
  the liberal arts like music\nand gymnastics, that is to say, to all the disciplines\ncapable
  of educating a man. However, among thesemathemata Plato bestows a privileged place
  on the\nsciences properly called mathematical. We must re-\nmember that geometry,
  arithmetic, astrology (in the   Page 463, Volume 1\n\n\nsense of astronomy), and
  music belonged typically to\nHellenic culture. In the Laws, Plato returns to this\nquestion
  in order to remind the reader that the first\nthree sciences must be acquired by
  every free man\n(Laws VII, 817E).\nIt was not until Aristotle that we find the separation\nbetween
  species and genus, which was to become the\nbasis of Aristotelian logic. The species
  is the specifica-\ntion of the genus; both appear in deduction, induction,\nand
  in the theory of definition (per genus proximum\net differentiam specificam). We
  find this hierarchy again\nin all the later types of classification, however, the\ncriterion
  of division by species and genus was later\nshown to be inadequate; for example,
  according to the\ntheory of evolution zoological and botanical species\nhave no
  stability. We must therefore take into account\nother criteria: such as the contrasting
  criteria of objec-\ntivity and subjectivity, criteria varying with respect to\nmethod,
  foundations, aims, and so forth. But, returning\nto Aristotle, who is generally
  more systematic in his\nordering of the sciences, we note that for him there\nexist
  only three large groups of sciences: (1) theoretical\nsciences (physics and philosophy);
  (2) practical sciences\n(ethics and politics); (3) poetic sciences (aesthetics).\nWe
  also note that for him all reality is knowable\nonly through classification, but
  we must not forget also\nthat for Aristotle all sciences have to be subordinate\nto
  philosophy. It is true that Aristotle's Physics comes\nexactly between mathematics
  and theology and is pre-\nceded by Logic, which is the structure of science and\nalso
  the science of structure. Physics is followed by\nAristotle's treatises On the Heavens
  (De caelo), andMeterology. This plan is in conformity with the prin-\nciples of
  classification which appear in several places\nof his work. We note three in particular.
  In Aristotle'sTopics we read that science “is indeed called specula-\ntive, practical,
  and poetic, the differences depending\non how each is related respectively to the
  theory, the\nproduction, and the action of something” (Topics VI,\n6, 145a 15).
  In the Nicomachean Ethics (VI, 3-5) there\nis a brief passage concerning art (technē),
  science\n(epistemē), wisdom (phronēsis), philosophy (sophia), and\nintelligence
  (nous). There are longer passages in theMetaphysics.\n\n“Physics is the theoretical
  science of material objects\nin motion...; mathematics is a contemplative sci-\nence,
  though certain mathematical entities are station-\nary” (VI, 1026a). Then farther
  on: “Theoretical sci-\nences come before the practical ones and philosophy\nbefore
  the theoretical sciences...; motion exists only\nin relation to quantity, quality,
  and place” (XI, 7\npassim; XI, 12, 1068b).\nAmong Aristotle's pupils, Demetrius
  of Phalerum\nwas a great encyclopedic mind and one of the orga\nnizers of the library
  in Alexandria, the center of scien-\ntists and philosophers. He deserves mention
  here for\nhaving introduced divisions and subdivisions of knowl-\nedge with the
  aim of permitting specialization in a\ngiven field of study. In the second century
  B.C., there\nwas Posidonius of Apamea, the Stoic and polymath;\nhe was later in
  Rome and Cadiz; his work also included\nall fields of learning, though unfortunately
  only some\nfew fragments of his work are extant.\nIn the following century, in Rome,
  Marcus Terentius\nVarro expounded a whole program of studies extending\nfrom grammar
  to architecture (Varro was contem-\nporary with Vitruvius), the program answering
  certain\npractical needs without being devoid, however, of a\ncertain idealism.
  In Varro's Disciplinarum (ca. 50 B.C.),\nwhich may be regarded as the first illustrated
  encyclo-\npedia, we find the following classification: grammar,\ndialectic, rhetoric,
  geometry, arithmetic, astrology,\nmusic, medicine, and architecture. It reflects
  perfectly\nthe genius of his time and especially of his people;\nit owes nothing,
  in any case, to Aristotelian ideas. With\nrespect to special disciplines, mention
  must be made\nof the works of the physician A. Cornelius Celsus and\nthe Natural
  History of Pliny the Elder in 37 books,\ncompleted in A.D. 77, a true testament
  of ancient sci-\nence and a model of classification within a branch\nof science.
  Pliny's work has come down to us in its\nentirety.\nWe know that the Arabs preserved
  Creek science,\nthat they translated the works of the ancients, added\ncommentaries,
  and not only left the imprint of their\ngenius on these commentaries, but made some
  original\ncontributions in every field of knowledge. Greek sci-\nence, enriched
  by the Arabs' contribution, was intro-\nduced by the Moors into Spain, and then
  proceeded\nto penetrate other European countries. Within Islam\nthere appeared during
  the seventh century the first\nseeds of the new sciences which were essentially
  reli-\ngious; then a distinction was made between Arabic\nsciences (such as poetry
  and the art of oratory) and\nforeign sciences (astronomy, medicine, mathematics).\nMost
  of the “foreign sciences” came from the Greek\nheritage, thanks to the Syrian translations;
  there were\nalso works translated from the Sanskrit via the Pali.\nA very distinct
  effort at classification is discernible\namong the Arabs, for example, in Al Farabi
  and\nAvicenna (Ibn Sina), an effort which had been preceded\nby the work of systematization.
  To be remembered are\nthe names of Djahiz (`Amr Ibn Bahr Jahiz), an Iraquian\nscientist
  (died 868), author of a bestiary, or Book of\nAnimals in seven volumes, in which
  we meet subjects\ngoing beyond the scope of the title. His contemporary\nIbn Qutaibah
  wrote a treatise, Adab al Katib, contain-\ning an essay on classification (in the
  introduction).\n   Page 464, Volume 1\n\n\n\n\nIn China and in India throughout
  the centuries, there\nare examples of classification in encyclopedic works.\nIn
  China such works always enjoyed, more than else-\nwhere, an important role in education
  and in prepara-\ntion for taking examinations for official positions. In\nthe Han
  dynasty (second century B.C.) appeared a\ndictionary entitled Erh-ya; it was probably
  composed\nearlier. This work is divided into nineteen categories:\nexplanation of
  definitions, definitions of concepts, ex-\nplanation of words, degrees of affinity;
  then come the\nart of construction, tools, music, heaven, earth, hills,\nmountains,
  water, fields, forests, insects, fish, birds,\nquadrupeds, and domestic animals.
  Notice that this\nseries is not devoid of a certain structure. During the\nsame
  period there also appeared a classification in the\ndictionary of Liu Hsi (or Liu
  Hsieh), the Shih-ming\n\nor interpretation of concepts. The criterion applied is\nthe
  way of passing from heaven to earth and from earth\nto man; it includes twenty-seven
  divisions. In the Ming\nera, which marked the first commercial contacts with\nthe
  Occident, the number of schools and candidates\ntaking examinations increased rapidly;
  in 1615, Mei\nYing-tsu published the Tzu-hui, a dictionary which\nrevolutionized
  the arrangement of words by ordering\nthem on the basis of graphic analogies. A
  century later,\nby taking the Tzu-hui as a model, a new dictionary\nwas published,
  the K'ang-hsi tzu-tien, (dictionary of\nthe era of “splendid peace”) which serves
  as the basis\nof modern Chinese encyclopedias.\nIn India, works embracing the whole
  of knowledge\nor bearing on a particular field have been traditional\nsince ancient
  times. The language used in the beginning\nwas nearly always Sanskrit. In the first
  centuries A.D.\nthere were the Dharmaśāstra (Treatises of the Correct\nOrder) in
  which there are ideas on cosmology, social\nrules, human functions, and law. In
  the eleventh cen-\ntury, the encyclopedic work of the Sanskrit author\nfrom Kashmir,
  Abinavagupta, and in the twelfth cen-\ntury Somadeva's work on the arts and techniques
  are\nworthy of notice. At the beginning of the nineteenth\ncentury, encyclopedic
  works multiplied constantly, at\nfirst in Sanskrit, then in the majority of the
  languages\nof India: Hindi (the government's language), Bengali,\nMarath, Gujrāti,
  Tamil, Malayālam, Telugu, Kannada.\nReturning to the Occident, more precisely to
  the\nmedieval Christian Occident, we find that for many\ncenturies the regular study
  of the Quadrivium (arith-\nmetic, music, geometry, and astronomy) was a required\npreliminary
  to the study of philosophy and theology.\nThis rule, followed in Paris as well as
  in Oxford, had\nbeen the practice in Constantinople where a new\nbranch of science
  was added to the list, namely, the\nart of “horse-matters” or veterinary art. In
  Paris,\namong the first masters of the Abbey of Saint-Victor,\n which was one of
  the famous Parisian schools of the\ntwelfth century, was the important scholar,
  Hugh of\nSaint-Victor. His chief work, the Didascalicon, contains\na classification
  of the sciences and is a typical example\nof the cultural level of the high Middle
  Ages. The\nfollowing are its main divisions, resulting from philos-\nophy's encompassing
  all knowledge. Philosophy is sub-\ndivided into: (1) theoretical sciences (mathematics,\nphysics,
  theology); (2) practical sciences (private or\npublic); (3) mechanical sciences
  (navigation, agricul-\nture, hunting, medicine, theater); (4) logic, including\ngrammar
  and rhetoric. There is obviously a certain\narbitrariness in the system proposed
  here, but nautical\nknowledge emerges as a new branch of science. Fur-\nthermore,
  cartography is soon to make its appearance—\nwell before the era of great sea voyages
  and discoveries.\nAs for Hugh of Saint-Victor, a curious mind and good\npedagogue,
  he gave his readers the following advice:\nlearn everything, you will see later
  that nothing is\nsuperfluous (omnia disce, videbis postea nihil esse\nsuperfluum).\nIn
  the thirteenth century, we see how Roger Bacon,\ncontinuing the work of Robert Grosseteste,
  placed\nmathematics at the base of the sciences of nature. His\nclassification contains
  four large classes: (1) grammar \nand logic; (2) mathematics; (3) philosophy of
  nature;\nand (4) metaphysics and ethics.\nWe must now observe that the essays on
  classification\nmentioned above, though they provide us with a fairly\nfaithful
  picture of the knowledge of an era and in a\ngiven country, have yet failed to yield
  any satisfactory\nconnection among the scientific disciplines; they fail\neven more
  to furnish a theory of knowledge internal\nto the sciences which would enable us
  to take into\naccount the great currents of thought in the sciences.\nIt was not
  until the time of the Renaissance, more\nspecifically, the end of the Renaissance,
  that a system\nof classification appeared which for the first time is\nlogical,
  organic, and firmly structured with respect to\naims, objects, and different groups
  of phenomena. It\nwas the system proposed by Francis Bacon in his work\non the worth
  and advancement of the sciences (De\ndignitate et augmentis scientiarum). The author
  applied\npsychological criteria, namely, Memory, Imagination,\nand Reason: history
  is constructed by memory, and may\nbe either Civil History or Natural History; poetry
  flows\nfrom the fancy or imagination, and may be narrative,\ndramatic, or parabolic;
  finally, philosophy, which re-\nsults from the use of reason, is divided into the
  sciences\nof the divine, of nature, and of man. The system of\nthe classification
  of the sciences and arts by Francis\nBacon was adopted, with a few modifications,
  by\nd'Alembert in the Discours préliminaire des éditeurs\nde l'Encyclopédie.\n\n   Page
  465, Volume 1\n\n\n\n\nLocke and Leibniz make a clear distinction between\nnatural
  sciences (of bodies and of the mind) and moral\nsciences (history and ethics). Locke
  introduced Semi-\notic or the science of language, and Leibniz gave logic\na preponderant
  place. From the eighteenth century on,\nmost philosophers and scientists who dealt
  with clas-\nsification divided the sciences into two fundamental\nkinds: sciences
  of nature and sciences of the mind.\nTowards the middle of the nineteenth century
  there\nappeared the system of Auguste Comte, which is based\non a series of decreasing
  generality and increasing\ncomplexity of subject matter in the following order:\nmathematics,
  astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology,\nsociology. The order of the classes is
  inherently linear,\nand has several weak points. Comte pictured in it a\n“natural
  logic” which has nothing to do with the mod-\nern idea of axiomatic logic. He excluded
  the study of\na spiritual or purely mental subject (it is true that he\nlater added
  morals and introspective data); he included\namong the abstract sciences the concrete
  science of\nastronomy. His system was reshaped by T. Whittaker\nwho separated the
  two orders of objective (physical)\nand subjective (psychological) sciences; unfortunately,\nthis
  separation fails to take account of the historical\ndevelopment of the sciences.\nIt
  was the great physicist A. M. Ampère who pro-\nposed to make a comprehensive table
  of all the fields\nof science. In his first table, Ampère separated all\nknowledge
  into two domains and divided each domain\ninto subdomains and branches; the first
  domain com-\nprised the cosmological sciences and the second the\nsciences of the
  mind. In his second table, each branch\nis divided into sub-branches and into the
  primary sci-\nences. In a third and final classification, he divided each\nscience
  of the first order into sciences of the second\nand third orders, thus producing
  a sort of binary system\nwhich provided a total of 27 = 128 names of disci-\nplines.
  Ampère's system based on the content of the\nsciences, possesses a very dynamic
  internal structure;\nit takes into account the historical relations among\ndifferent
  domains and it remains the most complete\ninventory of scientific knowledge for
  the mid-\nnineteenth century.\nIn 1851, A. A. Cournot worked out a system which\nintroduced
  a separation between structural laws and\nhistorical criteria in all their forms
  by employing three\ngreat series of sciences, a theoretical, an historical, and\na
  practical series, each composed of the following kinds\nof science: mathematical,
  physical, biological, mental\nor symbolical, and political. Every branch of science\nhas
  its place in one of the three times five boxes in\ncolumns. This is clearly an advance
  on Comte's system\nin particular, even though, here again, logic remains\na difficult
  science to place satisfactorily. (The question\n can again be raised whether each
  science does not have\nits own axiomatic structure or whether there might not\nbe
  a common axiomatic structure underlying all the\nsciences.)\nNot long after Cournot,
  Herbert Spencer started\nfrom the assumption that all knowledge varies with\nthe
  object, and he classified the sciences according to\ntheir degree of abstraction
  in relation to the object.\nHe thus obtained a linear series going from the abstract\nto
  the concrete, in which series there is the following\norder of succession: the abstract
  sciences, like logic and\nmathematics which are concerned with the form in\nwhich
  phenomena appear; the abstract-concrete sci-\nences, like mechanics, physics, and
  chemistry which\ninvestigate the causes of these phenomena; and, finally,\nthe concrete
  sciences which are interested only in\nresults. There is a striking similarity between
  this divi-\nsion and the one in the passage from Aristotle's Topics\n\nquoted above.\nIt
  is in the Manuel du libraire et de l'amateur de\nlivres (“Bookseller's and Book-Lover's
  Manual”) of\nJacques-Charles Brunet, and exactly in the introduction\nto Volume
  6 (5th ed. 1865), that we find the first insight\ninto a historical classification.
  The author examines\nmany systems, including Konrad Gesner's, that of the\nParisian
  publishers at the time of the Revolution, and\nAmpère's.\nSeveral German and British
  philosophers and scien-\ntists dealt with the same problem of classification.\nBesides
  Schopenhauer, who distinguished between\nempirical (a posteriori) sciences and pure
  (a priori)\nsciences, there were Hegel, Helmholtz, Wilhelm\nDilthey, Hugo Münsterberg,
  and later the psychologists\nAlfred Adler and Wilhelm Wundt. Wundt drew a sharp\ncontrast
  between the sciences of the real and formal\nsciences. The chemist and Nobel laureate
  Wilhelm\nOstwald divided the sciences into formal, physical, and\nbiological. Paul
  Tillich considered three kinds: sciences\nof thought or the ideal, of being or the
  real, and of\nthe mind or normative sciences. Among the British\nwriters, classifications
  were made by Jeremy Bentham,\nJohn Stuart Mill, Karl Pearson, and Franklin H. Gid-\ndings.
  The American scientist and philosopher Charles\nS. Peirce (son of the mathematician
  and astronomer\nBenjamin Peirce) classified the sciences after investi-\ngating
  and writing on logic, psychology, mathematics,\nastronomy, optics, chemistry, and
  even technology.\nPeirce emphasized methods of inquiry in two essays\n“The Fixation
  of Belief” and “How To Make Our Ideas\nClear” (Popular Science Monthly, 1877-78),
  which\nmark the beginning of American pragmatism, though\nhe later preferred the
  term “pragmaticism” (as ex-\nplained in the article “Pragmatism” in this Dictionary).\nPeirce's
  trichotomous classification placed Sciences of   Page 466, Volume 1\n\n\nDiscovery
  first, followed by Sciences of Review and\nPractical Sciences in a descending order
  of importance.\nSciences of Discovery included Mathematics (of logic,\nof discrete
  series, of continua and pseudo-continua),\nPhilosophy (phenomenology, normative
  science, meta-\nphysics), and Idioscopy (physical and psychical sci-\nences). Peirce
  had a low opinion of Comte's and Spen-\ncer's attempts at synthesis which fell under
  Sciences\nof Review, and had even a lower opinion of the Practi-\ncal Sciences which
  included a motley array of items\nsuch as etiquette, paper-making, wine tasting,
  etc.\n(Peirce, I, 77-137).\nIn 1920, Adrien Naville's Classification des sciences\n\nappeared,
  based not on nomenclature, strictly speaking,\nbut on the leading ideas of the principal
  groups of\nsciences and their interrelations. Naville separated\nthree great classes
  of science: Theorematics, science of\nlaws; History, science of facts; and Canonics,
  science\nof normative rules. These three classes provide answers\nto three questions,
  respectively: What is possible?\nWhat is real? What is good? To Naville the science\nof
  laws (nomology) is fundamental. A law is a condi-\ntionally necessary relationship;
  law exists wherever\nresemblance dominates the scene. Hence, science must\nbe concerned
  with general facts, thus recalling the\nstatement of Marcelin Berthelot (1827-1907)
  in the\nPreface to the Grande Encyclopédie (p. v): “The classi-\nfication of general
  facts is the classification of the\nsciences.”\nIn the first class considered by
  Naville, following\nnomology are mathematics, physics, chemistry, somatic\nbiology,
  psychology, and sociology. Natural history, the\ntheory of evolution, and human
  geography belong to\nthe second class. The sciences of normative rules are\nthe
  work of the arts and of everything concerned with\nthe beautiful, the true, and
  the useful for society as\nwell as for the individual.\nAmong recent thinkers preoccupied
  with the prob-\nlem of classification is the Soviet writer Bonifatii M.\nKedrov
  whose system is a closed, cyclical, and tight\nstructure based on principles of
  objectivity, subordi-\nnation, and transition from lower to higher forms. The\npsychologist
  Jean Piaget has on several occasions in-\nvestigated classification, its history,
  and its importance\nfor the theory of knowledge. He has emphasized the\nincreasing
  interpenetration of all the branches of\nknowledge, the role of linguistic structuralism,
  and the\noperational theory of intelligence. The system which\nhe has proposed is
  not circular or closed, and even\nless a linear one, but rather takes the form of
  a con-\nstantly growing spiral. According to Piaget, the\nsubject-object opposition
  and dualism must be elimi-\nnated, for there is a constant interaction and mutual\nexchange
  between the two.\n\n The object is known only through actions of the subject\nand
  the subject is known only through the relations it has\nto objects, from which the
  twofold consequence is that in\norder to ground logic and mathematics we must really
  go\nback in one form or another to the subject, and in order\nto construct a science
  of the subject we must go back to\nbiology, hence also to physics and mathematics\n\n(Piaget,
  p.\n1159).\n\n\nLately a leading role has been assigned to language,\nto its mathematical
  structure, its axiomatic logic of\ngrammatical categories, and to the logic of binary\nrelations
  in linguistics. The linguistic problem is tied\nto the automatic (computerized)
  treatment of “infor-\nmation,” which is a matter of interest not only to\nphilologists,
  philosophers, and psychologists but\nequally as much to mathematicians, cybernetic
  theo-\nrists, and engineers. Logic, which has only with great\ndifficulty found
  its place in the classification of the\nsciences, is not the sole basis of structural
  linguistics,\nfor the latter depends on the psychology of form\n(Gestalttheorie)
  and on topology and graphs. Starting\nwith language everything seems to converge
  on the\nunity of knowledge. This advance towards unity should\nperhaps be, after
  all, the primary aim of a new scien-\ntific humanism. A classification of the sciences
  which\nis free from the subject-object dualism and from an\nenslaving chainwork
  of values, and which takes into\naccount the profound, intimate, and reciprocal
  rela-\ntionships among all disciplines, would be the only\nclassification fit to
  instruct us about the present state\nof our scientific knowledge.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nA.-M.
