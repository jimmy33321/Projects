                  ALLEGORY INLITERARY HISTORY
- |2
                  In the expansion of Western thought allegory has
- |2
                      played a major part from the earliest times to the present. Allegories have
- |2
                      taken many forms, from mere emblems like the eagle and the dove, to the
- |2
                      simple fables of Aesop and parables of Christ, to vast poetic
- |2
                      structures like The Divine Comedy and equally large
- |2
                      forms like the patristic glosses and commentaries on the Bible. Essentially
- |2
                      a means of structuring language so as to produce continuously linked series
- |2
                      of double or multiple meanings, this symbols mode depends largely upon
- |2
                      syncretic mixtures of symbols from which it builds up “levels of
- |2
                      meaning,” sometimes as few as two, or as many as seven.
- |2
                      Minimally it holds that no single literal meaning can stand alone, but that
- |2
                      a valid utterance must possess a transcendent meaning as well, a
- |2
                      symbolic surplus beyond the literal level. Most alle- gories are images of cosmic order, and their fixed,
- |2
                      hierarchical, and timeless character becomes problem- atic whenever such cosmic orders are subjected to
- |2
                      temporal analysis. The key to the permanence of al-
- |2
                          legory throughout history appears to be its ornamental surface,
- |2
                      which allies it with changes in cosmology and decorum and gives it an
- |2
                      exploratory as well as a tradi- tional and
- |2
                      conservationist function.
- "                \n"
- |2
                          Terminology.
- |2
                       Following classical tradition, the sev-
- |2
                          enth-century scholar Isidore of Seville called allegory an
- |2
                      inversion of speech, alieni loquium, aliud enim sonat,
- |2
                          aliud intelligitur, whereby, in saying one thing
- |2
                       a person conveys or understands something else (
- |2
                          Ety- mologiae
- |2
                       I, 47.22). Such deceptively simple formulas, which abound in the
- |2
                      history of allegory, suggest, if nothing else, the fundamentally oblique
- |2
                      character of this symbolic mode. When Saint Augustine speaks of
- |2
                      “a mode of speech in which one thing is understood by
- |2
                      another,” his very open definition is based on the assumption
- |2
                      that some primary or literal
- |2
                      (ῥητη̂) level of sense
- |2
                      may include another secondary or even more remote sense, which the trained
- |2
                      interpreter will seek out through a process of reflection. Such
- |2
                      secondary meanings may be imposed upon a text, or an author may
- |2
                      clearly build them into a text, but no clear dis-
- |2
                          tinction separates the interpretive and creative aspects of
- |2
                      allegory, since the two are poles in a single commu- nicative method. The allegorical poet encodes an
- |2
                      oblique, multiple (Dante called it a “polysemous”)
- |2
                      meaning in his fiction, using emblems and iconographic devices, for
- |2
                      example, the scythe of time, or the apple of discord, and the stories that
- |2
                      go with them.
- |2
                  The allegorical interpreter decodes this same com-
- |2
                      plex message, which assumes that allegory is a struc- tural reality within the text. Nevertheless, though
- |2
                          al- legory may exist in a text as a
- |2
                      structure, the key to this structure is usually found in some system of
- |2
                      values or ideas that lies outside the immediate context.
- |2
                      “The allegorical method means the interpretation of a text
- |2
                      in terms of something else, irrespective of what that something else is.
- |2
                      That something else may be book learning, it may be practical wisdom, or it
- |2
                      may be one's inner consciousness. All these are matters which depend
- |2
                      upon external circumstances” (Wolfson, Philo, I, 134). Allegory thus not only assumes a certain stabil- ity of literal meaning, but also the
- |2
                      legitimacy of a movement back and forth between that literal meaning
- |2
                      and some external frame of reference. In the history of the mode both
- |2
                      creators and interpreters have en- joyed wide
- |2
                      freedom in the ways they have understood the internal and external
- |2
                      dimensions of their texts, and the historian is faced with a bewildering
- |2
                      variety of allegorical procedures. Theologians, however, have often
- |2
                      sought to systematize the allegorical method.
- |2
                  A plethora of traditional technical terms conveys the encyclopedic spirit of
- |2
                      this procedure. Hardly an idea in the history of Western thought has failed
- |2
                      to find allegorical expression, at some period or other. Major
- |2
                      allegorists like Dante and Spenser have often summed up the world views of
- |2
                      their time. The term “allegory” itself comes from the
- |2
                      teachings of Greco-Roman rhet- oricians,
- |2
                      Demetrius, Cicero, Quintilian, and others, who take it to mean a series of
- |2
                      linked metaphors, as exemplified in Horace's Ode (I,
- |2
                      14), in which the poet elaborates on the “ship of
- |2
                      state,” subdividing the single main figure of speech into a
- |2
                      series of nautical/political042
- |2
                       parallels. Unlike the single metaphor, however, alle- gory tends to depart from the world of sense- experience, moving toward
- |2
                      rumination. Metaphor sees, but allegory thinks, and thus often creates an
- |2
                      effect of geometric abstraction. Allegory is furthermore highly
- |2
                      ornamental, using elaborate symbolism and personification.
- |2
                  Deriving from Greek allos + agoreuein
- |2
                      (“other + speak out”), allegory implies only the most
- |2
                      general kind of semantic doubling, and classical rhetoric draws rather
- |2
                      uncertain lines between allegory and other fig-
- |2
                      ures of speech, metaphor, synecdoche, metonymy, and the like. It
- |2
                      associates allegory with notions of design, with terms like paradeigma and schema,
- |2
                      and later critics link allegory with figura,
- |2
                      impresa, and emblema, which point
- |2
                      to vision, structure, and external form.
- |2
                  By contrast the older Greek term for allegorical meaning refers us to a
- |2
                      veiling function of language.Hyponoia
- |2
                      (ὑπόνοια) was
- |2
                      the term which, Plutarch tells us (De audiendis
- |2
                      poetic 4.19), the “ancients” had used, and
- |2
                      it implies a hidden meaning, a conjectural or suppositious sense, buried
- |2
                          under the literal surface. Plato (Republic II. 378d), Euripides (Phoenicians 1131-33), Aristophanes (Frogs
- |2
                      1425-31), Xenophon (Symposium III, 6), all use hyponoia to mean what is later subsumed under
- "                    allegory (Pépin, pp. 85-86). \n"
- |2
                          Hy- ponoia
- |2
                       furthermore has a noetic character; the reader or listener will have
- |2
                      to think his way through a se- mantic barrier,
- |2
                      beyond which lies a realm of mystic knowledge. Thus Philo Judaeus may
- "                    equate the \n"
- |2
                          hy- ponoia
- |2
                       of a text with its latent theme, its mystery, its secret, its
- |2
                      unexpressed, unseen, nonliteral, or simply intelligible meaning. While
- |2
                      theological and other ex- egetes stress the
- |2
                      mysteries of allegory, and classical rhetoric stresses its semantic form,
- |2
                      analyzing the shift from hidden to open meaning as a semantic
- |2
                      inversion, both exegetes and rhetoricians alike possess a large store
- |2
                      of technical synonyms, among them parabole, typos,
- |2
                          fabula, symbolon, ennoia, fictio, figmentum, insinuatio, significatio,
- |2
                          similitudo, figura, imago, inter-
- |2
                          pretatio, involucrum, integumentum. Some of these
- |2
                      terms define the “external circumstances” of allegory
- |2
                      as a theological framework, others as philosophy, still others as rhetoric
- |2
                      or poetics. In most of the terms obliquity and mystery are the chief
- |2
                      emphasis. Augus- tine observes in his De doctrina (2.7-8) that “when
- |2
                      something is searched for with difficulty it is, as a result, more
- |2
                      delightfully discovered.”
- |2
                  If an ascetic interpretive rigor is one main source of pleasure in allegory,
- |2
                      exegetical intricacy is the vice of the mode. From a certain angle allegory
- |2
                      is merely a mode of systematic commentary upon a text, as opposed to
- |2
                      an unmediated, direct, or literal reading of the text, and thus exegesis
- |2
                      must depart from its
- |2
                       source in the text. This departure may become ob- sessive. Dante labels his Commedia
- |2
                      “digressive,” while typically the medieval
- |2
                      commentator ringed his text with marginalia. The medieval distinction
- |2
                      between a gloss and a commentary allowed the latter to stray further
- |2
                      from the literal sense. The interpreter often thought of himself as boring
- |2
                      his way through a “rind” or
- |2
                      “bark,” so as to allow the hidden symbolic truth to
- |2
                      flow outward from the textual center. In the Middle Ages at least a text
- |2
                      would be valued in the measure to which its lode of inner meaning appeared
- |2
                      to defy exhaustion.

                          Continuities in the History of Allegory.
- |2
                       A literary method which encourages the search for multiplicity
- |2
                      of sense is bound to provoke attack from rationalist quarters, a situation
- |2
                      we observe with Plato, whose rejection of the poets from his ideal republic
- |2
                      includes a rejection of the allegorical defense of Homeric myth. Early
- |2
                      Greek philosophers, among them Heraclitus and Pythagoras, had found a piety
- |2
                      toward god, nature, and man in apparently scandalous passages concerning
- |2
                      the gods. Philosophy inverted myth, so that, for example, the jealousy
- |2
                      of a god would “truly” represent the physical
- |2
                      activity of a natural force. Such a means of saving Homer for morality
- |2
                      proved both superficial and irrational in the light of Plato's dialectical
- |2
                      analysis. For Plato this allegorical transformation of evil-minded
- |2
                      myths did more harm than good, for it permitted the continuance of poetry
- |2
                      in preference to the higher pursuit of philosophy. The wisdom saved thereby
- |2
                      was, in principle, sophistry. Ironically, Plato himself pro- vided the most substantial mechanism and
- |2
                      authority for the persistence of Western allegory.
- |2
                  The Platonic theory of ideas has two aspects which lead to allegorical
- |2
                      interpretations of both signs and things, provided the overarching
- |2
                      authority of dialectic is allowed to fade from sight. In the first place
- |2
                      the ideas may be taken to constitute the formulas, if not exactly the
- |2
                      forms, by which the allegorist's “some-
- |2
                          thing” is interpreted as
- |2
                      “something else.” If the snake is an emblem of
- |2
                      jealousy, then it is the idea jealousy that
- |2
                      organizes the “coaptation” of the snake for this
- |2
                      symbolic purpose. To speak of “the idea of a thing”
- |2
                      is almost to invoke the allegorical process, for the idea transcends the
- |2
                      thing, much as the allegorist's fiction departs from the literal sense of
- |2
                      an utterance. Yet this is not the strongest Platonic support for allegory,
- |2
                          pow- erful though it is.
- |2
                  More important is the Platonic arrangement of the theory of ideas as a vast
- |2
                      hierarchical construct, from lower to higher forms. By adopting the
- |2
                      “principle of plenitude,” the notion that an
- |2
                      intelligible world would possess all possible forms of all possible
- |2
                      things—as the effluence of the One—Plato answered the allegorist's043
- |2
                       encyclopedic demand for a plenitude of
- |2
                      “somethings” by which to symbolize his
- |2
                      “anythings.” Plenitude also implied an infinitely
- |2
                      subdivided universe, while it led to an otherworldly tendency within the
- |2
                      whole ap- proach to life, such that a
- |2
                      Platonizing allegorist would always be happy to think of X in terms of Y,
- |2
                      since this would achieve transcendency beyond the bonds of mere
- |2
                      material reference. By questioning the essential value of material nature,
- |2
                      the Platonic dialectic opens the way to a spiritualizing of nature, and in
- |2
                      the case of Plato himself this leads to the use of allegory pre- cisely at the moment in his dialogues when
- |2
                      the analysis of nature has reached the highest point of transcend- ence describable in natural,
- |2
                      human terms. At that point a leap of iconographic faith takes place, as in
- |2
                      the vision of love Diotima gives Socrates, when the realistic and
- |2
                      human drama of the Symposium gives way to a
- |2
                          “con- ceptual
- |2
                      myth,” a spiritual diagram of a love which cannot be represented
- |2
                      “in terms of” ordinary human experience. The Platonic
- |2
                      use of allegory, itself alle- gorized in the
- |2
                      Myth of the Cave, reaches a climax in the Timaeus.
- |2
                      There, since the universe is not explicable in purely natural terms, its
- |2
                      ideal character is permitted to surge up in a fanciful, visionary theory of
- |2
                      cosmic order.
- |2
                  The Platonic example may be archetypal for the history of allegory, in that
- |2
                      his attack upon Homeric allegorizing is not as general or consistent as at
- |2
                      first it seems. He is perhaps open to the charge that he is attacking
- |2
                      any allegory which differs in its frame of reference from his own.
- |2
                      Throughout the complex de- velopment of
- |2
                      Hebraic-Christian exegesis such private invectives are common. The
- |2
                      Christian exegetes attack their pagan counterparts, and then proceed to
- |2
                      employ the rejected hermeneutic method.
- |2
                  At the same time, while rejection and resistance to allegory occur
- |2
                      periodically within and between con- tending
- |2
                      schools of thought, the method can survive attack largely because its
- |2
                      principle of semantic inver- sion enables the
- |2
                      allegorist to shift his ground freely whenever an opponent questions him.
- |2
                      Since in the theological context of most serious ancient allegory
- |2
                      there is scarcely room for a scientific theory of lan-
- |2
                          guage, since, in short, language is here a means of revelation,
- |2
                      there seems to have been no way for the allegorist to gain perspective on
- |2
                      his own activity. By the second century A.D., as a treatise like Plutarch'sOf Isis and Osiris will show, a multiplicity of Medi- terranean religions had grown up,
- |2
                      yielding an unre- strained exchange of
- |2
                      figures between variant faiths, each one providing the materials for
- |2
                      iconography within the framework of some other faith.
- |2
                  In spite of the intricacy of much exegesis the mode generally depends for
- |2
                      its force upon the belief that
- |2
                       words have magical power, a belief that is evident in the
- |2
                      influential treatises of Pseudo-Dionysius, On the
- |2
                          Celestial Hierarchy and On the Divine Names.
- |2
                      Plotinus had already systematized the hierarchical aspect of the
- |2
                      Platonic ideas, giving to each hypostasis of the One a particular magical
- |2
                      quantum of effluence and in- fluence. Within
- |2
                      such frameworks allegory can play a double role. In its Neo-Platonic aspect
- |2
                      it looks “up- ward” to a
- |2
                      transcendental plane of purer Being, but at the same time it retains the
- |2
                      primitivist drive of a language system in which every term has its own
- |2
                      share of magical force. By the same token most allegorical fictions
- |2
                      are romantic myths, in which the characters make full use of magical
- |2
                      weapons, vehicles, settings, and quests. The history of allegory is,
- |2
                      strictly speaking, not the history of rival theologies and philosophies.
- |2
                      The logic of allegory is only remotely rationalistic. Instead, we
- |2
                      observe a struggle of magic-thinking to survive within a climate of
- |2
                      ever-increasing intellectual and semantic sophistication. This is the more
- |2
                      curious in the light of the allegorist's frequent pretense of being logi- cal and rational. The pretense covers the
- |2
                      true situation, which is that allegories are strict in the manner of
- |2
                      magic rituals, substituting mechanical for rational rigor.

                          Allegorical Syncretism.
- |2
                       The creation and inter- pretation
- |2
                      of allegorical texts seems to depend on an acceptance of syncretism, the
- |2
                      kind of colloidal mixture of religious, philosophical, and cultural beliefs
- |2
                      which particularly marks the Hellenistic Age, the second century A.D.,
- |2
                      and the High Renaissance, although in the Renaissance syncretism is
- |2
                      strongly aesthetic in its combination of elements. Syncretism may be icono- graphically distinguished from
- |2
                      synthesis, insofar as the former preserves the individual traits of the
- |2
                      combining beliefs, whereas the latter would achieve a radical
- |2
                      transformation of disparate cultural forces, until a sin- gle set among them came to dominate and control the
- |2
                      assimilation of other sets as minor premisses in the logic of the culture
- |2
                      as a whole. Syncretism is the cult of diversity within a culture yearning
- |2
                      for unified order. It is often to be associated with gnostic
- |2
                      spirituality, since the experience of gnosis
- |2
                      includes a transcendence of the multiplicity of faiths by entertaining all
- |2
                      their claims on an equal footing. Thus Gnosticism finds its sources in
- |2
                      Greek Orphism, Pythagoreanism, Mazdean dualism, Jewish apocalyptic,
- |2
                      Egyptian mystery- religions,
- |2
                      Hellenistic astrological cult, and various kinds of numerology,
- |2
                      “along with the crass 'spirituality' of mediums, quacks, and
- |2
                      religious adventurers” (Grant,Roman Hellenism, p. 74).
- |2
                  The early centuries of Christian expansion spanned a period of syncretism in
- |2
                      the Mediterranean world, a fact not without its bearing on the development of044
- |2
                       Christian exegesis. The Alexandrian School, most nota- bly Clement and Origen, who anticipated the visions
- |2
                      of the fourth-century fathers, Basil of Caesarea, Gregory Nazianzen, and
- |2
                      Gregory of Nyssa, introduced key notions from Greek philosophy, which was
- |2
                      given authority for them by the syncretism of Philo, who, although a
- |2
                      Jew, stands at the head of this tradition. The broadly allegorical
- |2
                      structure of Augustine's two cities, of God and Man, may owe something to
- |2
                      his own syncretic background. In such a climate the religious convert
- |2
                      may bring remnants of his former faith with him into the new faith.
- |2
                      Syncretism has this great ad- vantage for the
- |2
                      allegorist: it gathers in, rather than expels; but at the same time it
- |2
                      preserves the sense of diverse origins and intellectual styles.
- |2
                  A similar, if theologically less complicated syn-
- |2
                          cretism surrounds the artist, poet, and scientist during the
- |2
                      Renaissance. The “survival of the pagan gods” can
- |2
                      occur then, as during the Middle Ages, because while their pagan attributes
- |2
                      are assimilated by allegory to moral and mystical frameworks, all of which
- |2
                      are guided by Christian principle, their identities as pagan gods are
- |2
                      still preserved in ornamental forms within the work of art. This
- |2
                      “neo-paganism,” as we may call it, had arisen early
- |2
                      in the West and its legacy remains alive even during the Middle Ages,
- |2
                      although only when the Renaissance saw a fresh sense of freedom within
- |2
                      the domain of vision and imagination could the cult of diversity be
- |2
                      permitted to express itself in designs of universal harmony. There is thus
- |2
                      no conflict in the fact that Spenser, in The Faerie
- |2
                          Queene, bases an important episode and much of the detail of his
- |2
                      Fifth Book on “Egyptian” lore, coming from Plutarch,
- |2
                          Of Isis and Osiris, and Lucian, De Syria dea, while allegorically the poet ties
- |2
                      these materials to the legend of Saint George of England, the Arthurian
- |2
                      Legend, fairy lore, and so on, weaving the whole structure with fine
- |2
                      traces of Hermetic philosophy, number symbolism, and the cosmology of
- "                    Giordano Bruno. Such combinations \n"

- |2
                       their elements in a sort of mosaic. On the surface such iconographies
- |2
                      are richly textured and decorated.
- |2
                  Piety may be the chief source of syncretic abun-
- |2
                      dance. The allegorist does not wish to lose any of the materials
- |2
                      present to his mind. This is clear in the case of both Homeric and biblical
- |2
                      allegory. A range of motives may contribute to such systematic
- |2
                          “accommo-
- |2
                      dation.” Piety begins with the mystery of the word
- |2
                      itself, spoken in fine verses or written down in magical alphabetic
- |2
                      characters. Ancient allegory also displays a reverence for age, naturally
- |2
                      enough, since men obeyed inherited social, political, and religious
- |2
                      forms of authority. Finally, piety includes the widely held belief
- |2
                      that poets, prophets, lawmakers, priests, and philosophers—wise
- |2
                      men, in short—enjoyed their wis
- |2
                      dom because they were divinely inspired. Inspiration in
- |2
                      particular could account for the jumble of disparate pieces that, over
- |2
                      time, found its way into a sacred canon. The inspired and mystical meaning
- |2
                      was proved rather than disproved by the appearance of arbitrary
- |2
                      inclusion. The more erotic the Song of Songs, the better its candidacy for
- |2
                      allegorical interpretation as a myth of hierogamy between divine and human
- |2
                      partners. Once the alien document is compressed into the overall
- |2
                      vision, its message, assumed to be an inspired revela- tion, takes on a transcendental character, and
- |2
                      allegory must follow.
- |2
                  To piety as the conservative force of syncretism may be added its debased
- |2
                      form, superstition. A higher mo- tive, which is
- |2
                      harder to define, is the conciliatory and accommodating desire to permit a
- |2
                      diverse world of many faces and characters. This motive comes into
- |2
                      play when rival world views meet in conflict at their bor- ders, when the opposite impulse would, as with icono- clasm, seek to destroy the rival
- |2
                      iconography. Allegory here becomes a diplomatic medium of thought. Pseudo- Heraclitus, for example, tries
- |2
                      to balance different in- terests in his Homeric Problems (first century A.D.). He claims
- |2
                      that Homer's Apollo represents the sun, in a physical allegory of the
- |2
                      origins of the plague in theIliad, while his concern is with cosmogony in readingIliad XVIII, where the Shield of Achilles becomes
- |2
                      for him a vast cosmological symbol. Yet with these materi- alist readings he aligns others of a different sort,
- |2
                      as when he moralizes Athena to mean wisdom, or Hermes to mean
- |2
                      eloquence and reason. Finally, his overall syncretism stretches to include
- |2
                      a quasi-historical alle- gory, by which the
- |2
                      adultery of Ares and Aphrodite represents the mythic origin of
- |2
                      metalworking, while the ejection of Hephaistos from heaven stands for
- |2
                      the physical discovery that heat can be focussed by mirrors, to create
- |2
                      fire. The immediate aim of these varied inter-
- |2
                          pretations is the defense of Homer against his moraliz- ing detractors, but beyond this, and perhaps more
- |2
                      deeply felt, is the exegete's desire to use Homer as the encyclopedic
- |2
                      container for a wide and disparate vari- ety of
- |2
                      intellectual disciplines. Philosophy ceases to be the framework for Homer;
- |2
                      Homer becomes the frame- work for philosophy.
- |2
                      Homer has attained the canonical status of a sacred literary body.
- |2
                  The bolder allegorical syncretisms arise when the elements to be contained
- |2
                      by the allegory are histori- cally
- |2
                      accidental inclusions within an inherited literary corpus. The problem is
- |2
                      clearest with the Old Testa- ment. Origen, who
- |2
                      believes in the mysterious revela- tions of
- |2
                      Scripture, is aware how absurd it is to believe, literally, that God
- |2
                      planted a garden like a farmer, or that He walked about in the garden. With
- |2
                      the New Testament Origen recognized the patently implausible045
- |2
                       character of the story that the Devil could show the kingdoms
- |2
                      of the earth from a single mountain top. “And the careful reader
- |2
                      will detect thousands of other passages in the gospels like this, which
- |2
                      will convince him that events which did not take place at all are
- |2
                      woven into the records of what literally did happen” (De principiis IV.3.1). The allegorist therefore
- |2
                      proposes to supplant the literal inconsistency by a spiritual
- |2
                      equivalent possessed of inner truth, precisely, in short, what had been
- |2
                      veiled by the inconsistent literal surface. Believing that “the
- |2
                      skillful plan of [God] the provi- dential
- |2
                      ruler is not so clear in things on earth as it is in regard to the sun and
- |2
                      moon and stars,” Origen asserts the revelatory function of
- |2
                      language when deal- ing with sacred literature.
- |2
                  Origen is influenced by Philo Judaeus, through the intermediary Clement of
- |2
                      Alexandria, and this Alex- andrian
- |2
                      tradition, which would show parallels in the development of Hellenistic
- |2
                      allegory, suggests that major allegory requires a belief in miracles and
- |2
                          epiphe- nomena, at least on a verbal
- |2
                      level. Origen notes that it is “the most wonderful
- |2
                      thing” that spiritual truths could be veiled under
- |2
                      “stories of wars and conquerors and the conquered,”
- |2
                      and he notes that “the Word of God has arranged for certain
- |2
                      stumbling-blocks, as it were, and hindrances and impossibilities to be
- |2
                      inserted in the midst of the law and the history.” Such
- |2
                      barriers are providential—the more strange they seem, the
- |2
                      more they goad the reader to “learn from the Scrip- tures.” Like many allegorists, Origen can
- |2
                      suddenly undercut his own appearance of caprice. He holds that the
- |2
                      historically true passages are “far more numerous than those
- |2
                      which are composed with purely spiritual meanings.” Yet whenever
- |2
                      a historical scandal appears, he can, if he chooses, fall back on a
- |2
                      spiritual inter- pretation. For this
- |2
                      reason his method has appeared to one of his close students
- |2
                      “unchartably subjective.... Whatever Origen's theory of allegory
- |2
                      may have been, it is quite inaccurate to call his application of its sys- tematic” (Hanson, p. 245). Now,
- |2
                      if allegory is expected to have what Hanson calls
- |2
                      “rules,” it seems clear that Origen and all other
- |2
                      major allegorists are “unchartably subjective.” But
- |2
                      then, so is syncretism in general, and for that reason, in describing his
- |2
                      own work, Dante used his term “polysemous,” or
- |2
                      ambiguous.
- |2
                  Yet another approach will demand both more and less from allegorical
- |2
                      syncretism and will perhaps justify its endless prolixity. This approach is
- |2
                      to be found in the Origenist and Philonic belief in the mystery of the
- |2
                      Word. Prophecy assumes that the prophet not only sees the vision of the
- |2
                      truth, but can “speak out” for this vision, sharing
- |2
                      in the divine Logos. Philo may alle- gorize
- |2
                      any portion of the Old Testament, any single image or word, any story, any
- |2
                      disparity or contra
- |2
                      dictory episode. But he does not do this in a spirit of negative
- |2
                      or defensive reaction, but rather as the ex-
- |2
                          pression of an intellectual or speculative freedom. This mode
- |2
                      employs philosophic methods, but Philo is per-
- |2
                      haps less a philosopher than a prophet of philosophy. Thus he may go
- |2
                      beyond the Platonic use of the Ideas as the forms, or paradigms, of things
- |2
                      in the universe, and can hold that the Logos is everywhere immanent in
- |2
                      the cosmos—“the totality of the powers of God
- |2
                      existing within the cosmos itself” (Wolfson, Philo, p. 327). This Logos, unlike the Stoics' material logos,
- |2
                      is immaterial, and on that basis can lead to allegories judged
- |2
                      “unchartably subjective” from the perspective of
- |2
                      natural and human history. Phrased differently, the Philonic use of an
- |2
                      immanent logos directs hermeneutic towards mystery, which is buried within
- |2
                      the Word, whereas the Stoic logos directs it away from mystery towards
- |2
                      reason. Yet Philo and the allegorical tradition stemming from him may not
- |2
                      be identified with the via negativa of the
- |2
                      mystics, since rather than draw his cosmological interpretations into such
- |2
                      a spiritualism of the Logos that they reach evanescence, in a cloud of
- |2
                      unknowing, he draws them toward an infinitely ramified, but consistently
- |2
                      word-centered universe of discourse. What saves his allegory from
- |2
                      irrationality is its recognition that “rationality, when
- |2
                      conceived as complete, as excluding all arbitrariness, becomes itself
- |2
                      a kind of irrationality” (Lovejoy, Great Chain of
- |2
                          Being, p. 331). Philo is continuously interested in the
- |2
                      verbal, linguistic aspect of the Word. He shares the almost immemorial
- |2
                      use of exegetical etymologizing, which is finally canonized in the
- |2
                      encyclopedic Etymologiae of Saint Isidore. If we
- |2
                      broaden the Philonic approach to include images and figures of speech as
- |2
                      well as the literal or referential materials of language, we may speak
- |2
                      of the “logology” of poets and artists as well as of
- |2
                      theologians and philosophers (Burke, Rhetoric of
- |2
                      Religion).
- |2
                  The underlying wisdom of the Philonic strain of allegory is its stress on
- |2
                      the freedom of the interpreting mind, on what a seventeenth-century divine
- |2
                      called “the liberty of prophesying.” Its vice is
- |2
                      ingenuity, but its virtue is the corresponding one of a compulsion to
- |2
                      investigate and comment upon the Word and its prog-
- |2
                      eny, words. The noblest document composed with such allegory in mind
- |2
                      is the Fourth Gospel. Common to all such Logos-centered allegories is the
- |2
                      belief that words contain wisdom, and the form in which we inherit
- |2
                      words from the past is itself not without reason, if we can only discover
- |2
                      the inner web of motives that led to the slow formation of that legacy. It
- |2
                      is often said that allegory, outside the specifically historical mode
- |2
                      known as typology, is antihistorical. When morality and ethics are the
- |2
                      reference-point, this is true enough.046
- |2
                       But because words are an essential mechanism of human thought,
- |2
                      their recorded forms of combination and formation are primary resources of
- |2
                      the historian, and the allegorist's accommodative impulse includes a
- |2
                      desire to preserve these resources, rather than see them destroyed by
- |2
                      advances or regressions of a cultural set. When the ancient gloss
- |2
                      identifies Zeus as “life,” be-
- |2
                          cause his name coincides with the Greek word for life, an
- |2
                      element of history enters the interpretation through what may be a false
- |2
                      etymology. Such equations hold that the universe is coherent when read as a
- |2
                      logos.
- "                \n"
- |2
                          Allegory and the Cosmos.
- |2
                       The history of allegory is tuned to the history of cosmological
- |2
                      speculation, so much so that allegory might be defined as figurative
- |2
                      cosmology. Each such fiction presents the image of a universe (and this is
- |2
                      true even of short works), or implies that its details fit into a cosmic
- |2
                      picture. Yet this imagery is not identical with the scientist's use of
- |2
                      theoretical models. The allegorist does not prove and disprove hypotheses
- |2
                      which are then dropped if they fail to hold up as fact. Allegory does not
- |2
                      move toward the certainty of fact; it moves toward tenacity of belief.
- |2
                      Analogy serves the allegorist, as it serves the cosmolo- gist, but here the test of the figurative schema is not its yield of experiment or
- |2
                      observation, but its fertility in leading to still further figuration. The
- |2
                      allegorist treats his universe as if its being were literal, as if it
- |2
                      were a book. Thus there arises the tradition of “book as
- |2
                      symbol,” in which Homer and the Bible hold the first place. Such
- |2
                      works are simply large enough to contain a world of words. In them the cult
- |2
                      of the One gives way to a cult of the Universe.
- |2
                  As distinct from the Hellenic, a somewhat less phys-
- |2
                          ical notion of cosmos governs the Hebraic-Christian tradition.
- |2
                      Here, from the encyclopedic resources of the Old Testament come theories of
- |2
                      the Law as the form of the universe. Philo found the Law
- |2
                      “complete and true and good,” and in this total system “anything that seemed to be
- |2
                      lacking in it was really hidden behind the literalness of the words and it
- |2
                      was the task of the student to search it out” (Wolfson, Church Fathers, p. 25). Not necessarily the truth or
- |2
                      the goodness of the Torah led to its exegetical treatment, but rather
- |2
                      its assumed completeness. For Christians this unity carried over into
- |2
                      the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy by events recounted in the New.
- |2
                      The structure of the Bible as it finally evolved into the canonical
- |2
                      Books, bounded by Genesis and the Apocalypse, implies the cosmic
- |2
                      analogy on which its Logos is ordered.
- |2
                  Syncretism in ancient Mediterranean religious life raised the question of
- |2
                      universal order, while the in- fluence of
- |2
                      Alexander also led in this direction. The monolithic pretensions of
- |2
                      Augustan Rome may likewise have influenced the strongly allegorical cast of Vergi
- |2
                      lian and Ovidian poetry, so different from Homer. But it was not
- |2
                      until the Middle Ages that the drive toward universal containment and
- |2
                      encirclement led to the complete dominance of allegorical methods. From
- |2
                      the eleventh century onwards influences from Pseudo- Dionysius, Plato, and Plotinus give exegetes a
- |2
                      secure sense of philosophic direction. The Timaeus
- |2
                      and theCelestial Hierarchy provide terms and images. But in
- |2
                      all areas of life this period shows universalist pre- tensions, which Maurice de Wulf characterized simply
- |2
                      as “a tendency toward unity.” Political dreams of a
- |2
                      universal brotherhood, intellectual dreams of a totally organized body of
- |2
                      knowledge, theological dreams of a total theological summa—these were the natural background for
- |2
                      allegorical literature. Bernard of Clairvaux finds infinite detail in a
- |2
                      closed world, by imagining four infinitely reflexive
- |2
                      “mirrors” of knowl-
- |2
                      edge—the natural, intellectual, moral, and historical.
- |2
                      Dante's Commendia, whose form and setting rival the
- |2
                      universe, finds a parallel in his De monarchia, a
- |2
                      theory of political unification. By symmetry the actual physi- cal universe is converted into a symbol,
- |2
                      and we can speak of a “symbolic mentality” which
- |2
                      denied the more immediate puzzles presented by the senses. The flight
- |2
                      from the limited toward the infinity of the Divine Being kept its balance
- |2
                      only, if at all, by asserting that man's world was closed and finite.
- |2
                      Ockham's principle of parsimony was invented, it seems, to stem this icon- ographic tide, since scholastic
- |2
                      thought, at first ration- alizing, ends by
- |2
                      absorbing the medieval compulsion to turn relations into icons.
- |2
                  In a sense allegory thrives even more abundantly during the Renaissance,
- |2
                      because the new cosmology does not at once drive out the old, so that
- |2
                      visionary and scientific cosmologies coexist, their very difference
- |2
                      enriching the imagery of poets and theologians. The main development of the
- |2
                      mode is the gradual rejection of the theory of
- |2
                      “levels” of meaning. Most allegorists have in fact
- |2
                      used two levels, whatever they may have claimed to do. They take a sentence
- |2
                      and give it a double meaning. At its simplest this process will be
- |2
                      seen in the parables of Christ. Clement of Alexandria, however,
- |2
                      distinguished four levels on which he could read a sacred text, a literal
- |2
                      level and three subsidiary symbolic stages, the moral, physical, and
- |2
                      theological. Origen held that as man is made of body, soul, and
- |2
                      spirit, so interpretation must yield three levels of meaning, the literal,
- |2
                      moral, and spiritual. Jerome in- voked the
- |2
                      literal, tropological, and mystical. Augustine held that all readings of
- |2
                      Scripture, however structured, should express charity, yet he too could
- |2
                      speak of a hierarchy of levels, for instance, historical,
- |2
                      aetiological, analogical, and allegorical (De utilitate
- |2
                          credendi, 3.5). What became the classical formulation of Christian047
- |2
                       method, the fourfold theory, appeared in Saint John Cassian,
- |2
                      who set forth a system of historical (literal), tropological (moral),
- |2
                      allegorical, and anagogical. This theory is encapsulated in the mnemonic
- |2
                      distich, first cited in 1330, by Augustin de Dacie:
- "                        \n"
- "                            \n"
- |2
                                  Littera gesta docet, quid credas
- |2
                                  allegoria,
- "                            \n"
- |2
                                  Moralia quid agas, quo tendas
- |2
                                  anagogica.
- "                            \n"
- |2
                       The effect of such planar theories of reading is that allegory becomes
- |2
                      more mechanical in theory than it can or need ever be in practice.
- |2
                  What was once available only to the instructed interpreter is now the common
- |2
                      property of the experi- encing subject. It
- |2
                      is an error, however, to believe that romantic
- |2
                      “symbolism” destroys allegory, although it loosens
- |2
                      and reorders the “levels” on which texts are made and
- |2
                      read. Shelley's Prometheus Unbound is as much an
- |2
                      allegory as the Psychomachia of Prudentius
- |2
                      (348-?410). Where the mode radically declines in force is not as a creative
- |2
                      method, but in the interpretive divisions of theology, where the new
- |2
                      criticism of the Bible, with its scientific research into textual
- |2
                      evolution, raises questions about the literary level which are so
- |2
                      searching that the dependent symbolic levels pale in theological
- |2
                      importance.

- |2
                          Allegory and Time.
- |2
                       “Rationality has nothing to do with dates.”
- |2
                      Thus Lovejoy epitomized the static and “absolutely
- |2
                      rigid” form of the Great Chain of Being as it had set up the
- |2
                      framework of traditional allegory. The stasis of hierarchy is mirrored in
- |2
                      the markedly static character of most allegorical fictions, be they
- |2
                      stories, dramas, lyrics, or whatever. Allegorical narra- tive yields a fixated image of change, in which
- |2
                      time is synchronic, never diachronic. Augustine imagines human destiny
- |2
                      in the shape of a city, following the Book of Revelation. Joachim of Floris
- |2
                      diagrams history as an allegorical tree with stems and branches. Time
- |2
                      becomes a hypostatized form of becoming.
- |2
                  Two aspects of the mode are thus historically prob-
- |2
                          lematic. (1) The Hebraic-Christian belief in prophecy asserts
- |2
                      that historical figures may prefigure other his-
- |2
                          torical figures, Joshua becoming the “type” of
- |2
                      Jesus. Scholars have held that the historicity of the figurae radically differentiates them from allegorical
- |2
                      emblems, such as the anchor of faith. Yet the typological figure is
- |2
                      under constant pressure to revert to a timeless sym-
- |2
                      bol, since typology in fact is collapsing the diachronic time-span
- |2
                      and stopping the fluent openness of time by envisioning miraculous kairoi, or prophetic moments when time
- |2
                      “stands still.” (2) Modern science attacks the
- |2
                      fixation of allegory in yet another quarter, and here perhaps there exists
- |2
                      a possibility of a radical change in the allegorical method. During and
- |2
                      after the Renais- sance new methods arise
- |2
                      for the analysis and explora
- |2
                      tion of the origins of things, along with
- |2
                      their progres- sive development away from
- |2
                      those origins. The text of the Bible is one such object of study, but the
- |2
                      physical universe and the historical world of men are more crucial. In
- |2
                      the Monads of Bruno and Leibniz the Great Chain of Being is
- |2
                      “temporalized,” as the closed world of Ptolemy, so
- |2
                      useful to the poet's need for a cosmos, gives way to an infinite universe.
- |2
                  Even more upsetting is the discovery of anthro-
- |2
                          pological development. With the Renaissance a some- what aesthetic cult of Euhemerus arises, finding
- |2
                      human origins for the gods, who are regarded as divinized heroes. Such
- |2
                      beliefs lead, along with new historical and archeological knowledge, to new
- |2
                      theories of human evolution, beginning with primitive forms and advanc- ing to more complex societies. After
- |2
                      Vico it is no longer possible for mythology or iconography to divorce
- |2
                      itself from temporal change. First the philosophes
- |2
                      of the Enlightenment debunk the allegorizing of the gods and daemons,
- |2
                      then the ground shifts under all forms of imagination, so that
- |2
                      developmental myths take over from the former static world view. The
- |2
                      “new allegor- ism”
- |2
                      tends to be more monolithic than the old, permit-
- |2
                          ting a single theory of change, whatever it may be, to explain
- |2
                      various possible modes of change.

- |2
                          Allegory and Decorum.
- |2
                       While a large view may portend the general undermining of allegory in
- |2
                      the modern period, the close-up analysis of allegory makes this appear
- |2
                      an unlikely development. Allegories are, as a symbolic mode, composed of
- |2
                      ornaments—not, strictly speaking, metaphors. Thus, the Greek
- |2
                      term for the larger outlines of a major allegory would be kosmos, while in classical Greek the same term does double
- |2
                      duty for the rhetorician's “ornament.” The same
- |2
                      double usage appears in Latin decus, which grows
- |2
                      into the English terms “decoration” and
- |2
                      “decorum.” Allegory expresses the interplay of little
- |2
                      and great worlds, which are ornamentally reflecting surfaces of microcosm
- |2
                      and macrocosm.
- |2
                  There is no reason to suppose that men will cease to decorate themselves or
- |2
                      fail to recognize decorum. But modes of ornament continuously change. Con- ceivably the present world, with its
- |2
                      increased stand- ardization of artifacts
- |2
                      and its diminishing barriers to travel, will see the speeding-up of
- |2
                      allegorical processes. Whether revolutions undermine or reorder
- |2
                      cosmologies has become the allegorist's chief problem. Allegory can no
- |2
                      longer be what for centuries it had tried to be, the image of permanence in
- |2
                      a world of flux. Franz Kafka is perhaps the greatest allegorical writer of
- |2
                      modern times, and his work revels in cloudy interactions be- tween wierdly undefined characters. Yet Kafka
- |2
                      looks at this obscure scene with microscopic delicacy. He bases his
- |2
                      fictions largely upon “the Law,” on which,048
- |2
                       following the ancient Jewish tradition, he meditates and builds
- |2
                      a vision of man's destiny as a creature caught up in a closed, imprisoning
- |2
                      world.
- |2
                  Generally speaking, modern allegory shows sings of breaking down many of the
- |2
                      normal divisions between things, either by use of dream-mechanisms or by
- |2
                      other surrealistic devices. The mode is creatively perhaps most alive
- |2
                      in science-fiction, but it permeates the art of advertising, wherever
- |2
                      decoration and decorum are the primary commercial interests.
- |2
                      Philosophically and theologically there is less place for allegory than
- |2
                      in earlier centuries, but one can discern traces of it in the
- |2
                      subjectivism of the phenomenologist's concept of transcendence, and in the
- |2
                      actual use of fiction by ex- istentialist
- |2
                      authors (for example, the novels of Camus, or earlier, the quasi-fictional
- |2
                      treatises of Kierkegaard). As in previous times, the allegorist can today
- |2
                      use many different media, including music (with
- |2
                      “programs” and leitmotifs) and the visual arts (with
- |2
                      emblems and icons).

               Dictionary of the History of IdeasIn the expansion of Western thought allegory has
- |2
                      played a major part from the earliest times to the present. Allegories have
- |2
                      taken many forms, from mere emblems like the eagle and the dove, to the
- |2
                      simple fables of Aesop and parables of Christ, to vast poetic
- |2
                      structures like The Divine Comedy and equally large
- |2
                      forms like the patristic glosses and commentaries on the Bible. Essentially
- |2
                      a means of structuring language so as to produce continuously linked series
- |2
                      of double or multiple meanings, this symbols mode depends largely upon
- |2
                      syncretic mixtures of symbols from which it builds up “levels of
- |2
                      meaning,” sometimes as few as two, or as many as seven.
- |2
                      Minimally it holds that no single literal meaning can stand alone, but that
- |2
                      a valid utterance must possess a transcendent meaning as well, a
- |2
                      symbolic surplus beyond the literal level. Most alle- gories are images of cosmic order, and their fixed,
- |2
                      hierarchical, and timeless character becomes problem- atic whenever such cosmic orders are subjected to
- |2
                      temporal analysis. The key to the permanence of al-
- |2
                          legory throughout history appears to be its ornamental surface,
- |2
                      which allies it with changes in cosmology and decorum and gives it an
- |2
                      exploratory as well as a tradi- tional and
- |2
                      conservationist function.

                          Terminology.
- |2
                       Following classical tradition, the sev-
- |2
                          enth-century scholar Isidore of Seville called allegory an
- |2
                      inversion of speech, alieni loquium, aliud enim sonat,
- |2
                          aliud intelligitur, whereby, in saying one thing
- |2
                       a person conveys or understands something else (
- |2
                          Ety- mologiae
- |2
                       I, 47.22). Such deceptively simple formulas, which abound in the
- |2
                      history of allegory, suggest, if nothing else, the fundamentally oblique
- |2
                      character of this symbolic mode. When Saint Augustine speaks of
- |2
                      “a mode of speech in which one thing is understood by
- |2
                      another,” his very open definition is based on the assumption
- |2
                      that some primary or literal
- |2
                      (ῥητη̂) level of sense
- |2
                      may include another secondary or even more remote sense, which the trained
- |2
                      interpreter will seek out through a process of reflection. Such
- |2
                      secondary meanings may be imposed upon a text, or an author may
- |2
                      clearly build them into a text, but no clear dis-
- |2
                          tinction separates the interpretive and creative aspects of
- |2
                      allegory, since the two are poles in a single commu- nicative method. The allegorical poet encodes an
- |2
                      oblique, multiple (Dante called it a “polysemous”)
- |2
                      meaning in his fiction, using emblems and iconographic devices, for
- |2
                      example, the scythe of time, or the apple of discord, and the stories that
- |2
                      go with them.The allegorical interpreter decodes this same com-
- |2
                      plex message, which assumes that allegory is a struc- tural reality within the text. Nevertheless, though
- |2
                          al- legory may exist in a text as a
- |2
                      structure, the key to this structure is usually found in some system of
- |2
                      values or ideas that lies outside the immediate context.
- |2
                      “The allegorical method means the interpretation of a text
- |2
                      in terms of something else, irrespective of what that something else is.
- |2
                      That something else may be book learning, it may be practical wisdom, or it
- |2
                      may be one's inner consciousness. All these are matters which depend
- |2
                      upon external circumstances” (Wolfson, Philo, I, 134). Allegory thus not only assumes a certain stabil- ity of literal meaning, but also the
- |2
                      legitimacy of a movement back and forth between that literal meaning
- |2
                      and some external frame of reference. In the history of the mode both
- |2
                      creators and interpreters have en- joyed wide
- |2
                      freedom in the ways they have understood the internal and external
- |2
                      dimensions of their texts, and the historian is faced with a bewildering
- |2
                      variety of allegorical procedures. Theologians, however, have often
- |2
                      sought to systematize the allegorical method.A plethora of traditional technical terms conveys the encyclopedic spirit of
- |2
                      this procedure. Hardly an idea in the history of Western thought has failed
- |2
                      to find allegorical expression, at some period or other. Major
- |2
                      allegorists like Dante and Spenser have often summed up the world views of
- |2
                      their time. The term “allegory” itself comes from the
- |2
                      teachings of Greco-Roman rhet- oricians,
- |2
                      Demetrius, Cicero, Quintilian, and others, who take it to mean a series of
- |2
                      linked metaphors, as exemplified in Horace's Ode (I,
- |2
                      14), in which the poet elaborates on the “ship of
- |2
                      state,” subdividing the single main figure of speech into a
- |2
                      series of nautical/politicalDeriving from Greek allos + agoreuein
- |2
                      (“other + speak out”), allegory implies only the most
- |2
                      general kind of semantic doubling, and classical rhetoric draws rather
- |2
                      uncertain lines between allegory and other fig-
- |2
                      ures of speech, metaphor, synecdoche, metonymy, and the like. It
- |2
                      associates allegory with notions of design, with terms like paradeigma and schema,
- |2
                      and later critics link allegory with figura,
- |2
                      impresa, and emblema, which point
- |2
                      to vision, structure, and external form.By contrast the older Greek term for allegorical meaning refers us to a
- |2
                      veiling function of language.Hyponoia
- |2
                      (ὑπόνοια) was
- |2
                      the term which, Plutarch tells us (De audiendis
- |2
                      poetic 4.19), the “ancients” had used, and
- |2
                      it implies a hidden meaning, a conjectural or suppositious sense, buried
- |2
                          under the literal surface. Plato (Republic II. 378d), Euripides (Phoenicians 1131-33), Aristophanes (Frogs
- |2
                      1425-31), Xenophon (Symposium III, 6), all use hyponoia to mean what is later subsumed under
- "                    allegory (Pépin, pp. 85-86). \n"
- |2
                          Hy- ponoia
- |2
                       furthermore has a noetic character; the reader or listener will have
- |2
                      to think his way through a se- mantic barrier,
- |2
                      beyond which lies a realm of mystic knowledge. Thus Philo Judaeus may
- "                    equate the \n"
- |2
                          hy- ponoia
- |2
                       of a text with its latent theme, its mystery, its secret, its
- |2
                      unexpressed, unseen, nonliteral, or simply intelligible meaning. While
- |2
                      theological and other ex- egetes stress the
- |2
                      mysteries of allegory, and classical rhetoric stresses its semantic form,
- |2
                      analyzing the shift from hidden to open meaning as a semantic
- |2
                      inversion, both exegetes and rhetoricians alike possess a large store
- |2
                      of technical synonyms, among them parabole, typos,
- |2
                          fabula, symbolon, ennoia, fictio, figmentum, insinuatio, significatio,
- |2
                          similitudo, figura, imago, inter-
- |2
                          pretatio, involucrum, integumentum. Some of these
- |2
                      terms define the “external circumstances” of allegory
- |2
                      as a theological framework, others as philosophy, still others as rhetoric
- |2
                      or poetics. In most of the terms obliquity and mystery are the chief
- |2
                      emphasis. Augus- tine observes in his De doctrina (2.7-8) that “when
- |2
                      something is searched for with difficulty it is, as a result, more
- |2
                      delightfully discovered.”If an ascetic interpretive rigor is one main source of pleasure in allegory,
- |2
                      exegetical intricacy is the vice of the mode. From a certain angle allegory
- |2
                      is merely a mode of systematic commentary upon a text, as opposed to
- |2
                      an unmediated, direct, or literal reading of the text, and thus exegesis
- |2
                      must depart from its
- |2
                       source in the text. This departure may become ob- sessive. Dante labels his Commedia
- |2
                      “digressive,” while typically the medieval
- |2
                      commentator ringed his text with marginalia. The medieval distinction
- |2
                      between a gloss and a commentary allowed the latter to stray further
- |2
                      from the literal sense. The interpreter often thought of himself as boring
- |2
                      his way through a “rind” or
- |2
                      “bark,” so as to allow the hidden symbolic truth to
- |2
                      flow outward from the textual center. In the Middle Ages at least a text
- |2
                      would be valued in the measure to which its lode of inner meaning appeared
- |2
                      to defy exhaustion.

                          Continuities in the History of Allegory.
- |2
                       A literary method which encourages the search for multiplicity
- |2
                      of sense is bound to provoke attack from rationalist quarters, a situation
- |2
                      we observe with Plato, whose rejection of the poets from his ideal republic
- |2
                      includes a rejection of the allegorical defense of Homeric myth. Early
- |2
                      Greek philosophers, among them Heraclitus and Pythagoras, had found a piety
- |2
                      toward god, nature, and man in apparently scandalous passages concerning
- |2
                      the gods. Philosophy inverted myth, so that, for example, the jealousy
- |2
                      of a god would “truly” represent the physical
- |2
                      activity of a natural force. Such a means of saving Homer for morality
- |2
                      proved both superficial and irrational in the light of Plato's dialectical
- |2
                      analysis. For Plato this allegorical transformation of evil-minded
- |2
                      myths did more harm than good, for it permitted the continuance of poetry
- |2
                      in preference to the higher pursuit of philosophy. The wisdom saved thereby
- |2
                      was, in principle, sophistry. Ironically, Plato himself pro- vided the most substantial mechanism and
- |2
                      authority for the persistence of Western allegory.The Platonic theory of ideas has two aspects which lead to allegorical
- |2
                      interpretations of both signs and things, provided the overarching
- |2
                      authority of dialectic is allowed to fade from sight. In the first place
- |2
                      the ideas may be taken to constitute the formulas, if not exactly the
- |2
                      forms, by which the allegorist's “some-
- |2
                          thing” is interpreted as
- |2
                      “something else.” If the snake is an emblem of
- |2
                      jealousy, then it is the idea jealousy that
- |2
                      organizes the “coaptation” of the snake for this
- |2
                      symbolic purpose. To speak of “the idea of a thing”
- |2
                      is almost to invoke the allegorical process, for the idea transcends the
- |2
                      thing, much as the allegorist's fiction departs from the literal sense of
- |2
                      an utterance. Yet this is not the strongest Platonic support for allegory,
- |2
                          pow- erful though it is.More important is the Platonic arrangement of the theory of ideas as a vast
- |2
                      hierarchical construct, from lower to higher forms. By adopting the
- |2
                      “principle of plenitude,” the notion that an
- |2
                      intelligible world would possess all possible forms of all possible
- |2
                      things—as the effluence of the One—Plato answered the allegorist'sThe Platonic example may be archetypal for the history of allegory, in that
- |2
                      his attack upon Homeric allegorizing is not as general or consistent as at
- |2
                      first it seems. He is perhaps open to the charge that he is attacking
- |2
                      any allegory which differs in its frame of reference from his own.
- |2
                      Throughout the complex de- velopment of
- |2
                      Hebraic-Christian exegesis such private invectives are common. The
- |2
                      Christian exegetes attack their pagan counterparts, and then proceed to
- |2
                      employ the rejected hermeneutic method.At the same time, while rejection and resistance to allegory occur
- |2
                      periodically within and between con- tending
- |2
                      schools of thought, the method can survive attack largely because its
- |2
                      principle of semantic inver- sion enables the
- |2
                      allegorist to shift his ground freely whenever an opponent questions him.
- |2
                      Since in the theological context of most serious ancient allegory
- |2
                      there is scarcely room for a scientific theory of lan-
- |2
                          guage, since, in short, language is here a means of revelation,
- |2
                      there seems to have been no way for the allegorist to gain perspective on
- |2
                      his own activity. By the second century A.D., as a treatise like Plutarch'sOf Isis and Osiris will show, a multiplicity of Medi- terranean religions had grown up,
- |2
                      yielding an unre- strained exchange of
- |2
                      figures between variant faiths, each one providing the materials for
- |2
                      iconography within the framework of some other faith.In spite of the intricacy of much exegesis the mode generally depends for
- |2
                      its force upon the belief that
- |2
                       words have magical power, a belief that is evident in the
- |2
                      influential treatises of Pseudo-Dionysius, On the
- |2
                          Celestial Hierarchy and On the Divine Names.
- |2
                      Plotinus had already systematized the hierarchical aspect of the
- |2
                      Platonic ideas, giving to each hypostasis of the One a particular magical
- |2
                      quantum of effluence and in- fluence. Within
- |2
                      such frameworks allegory can play a double role. In its Neo-Platonic aspect
- |2
                      it looks “up- ward” to a
- |2
                      transcendental plane of purer Being, but at the same time it retains the
- |2
                      primitivist drive of a language system in which every term has its own
- |2
                      share of magical force. By the same token most allegorical fictions
- |2
                      are romantic myths, in which the characters make full use of magical
- |2
                      weapons, vehicles, settings, and quests. The history of allegory is,
- |2
                      strictly speaking, not the history of rival theologies and philosophies.
- |2
                      The logic of allegory is only remotely rationalistic. Instead, we
- |2
                      observe a struggle of magic-thinking to survive within a climate of
- |2
                      ever-increasing intellectual and semantic sophistication. This is the more
- |2
                      curious in the light of the allegorist's frequent pretense of being logi- cal and rational. The pretense covers the
- |2
                      true situation, which is that allegories are strict in the manner of
- |2
                      magic rituals, substituting mechanical for rational rigor.
- |2
                          Allegorical Syncretism.
- |2
                       The creation and inter- pretation
- |2
                      of allegorical texts seems to depend on an acceptance of syncretism, the
- |2
                      kind of colloidal mixture of religious, philosophical, and cultural beliefs
- |2
                      which particularly marks the Hellenistic Age, the second century A.D.,
- |2
                      and the High Renaissance, although in the Renaissance syncretism is
- |2
                      strongly aesthetic in its combination of elements. Syncretism may be icono- graphically distinguished from
- |2
                      synthesis, insofar as the former preserves the individual traits of the
- |2
                      combining beliefs, whereas the latter would achieve a radical
- |2
                      transformation of disparate cultural forces, until a sin- gle set among them came to dominate and control the
- |2
                      assimilation of other sets as minor premisses in the logic of the culture
- |2
                      as a whole. Syncretism is the cult of diversity within a culture yearning
- |2
                      for unified order. It is often to be associated with gnostic
- |2
                      spirituality, since the experience of gnosis
- |2
                      includes a transcendence of the multiplicity of faiths by entertaining all
- |2
                      their claims on an equal footing. Thus Gnosticism finds its sources in
- |2
                      Greek Orphism, Pythagoreanism, Mazdean dualism, Jewish apocalyptic,
- |2
                      Egyptian mystery- religions,
- |2
                      Hellenistic astrological cult, and various kinds of numerology,
- |2
                      “along with the crass 'spirituality' of mediums, quacks, and
- |2
                      religious adventurers” (Grant,Roman Hellenism, p. 74).The early centuries of Christian expansion spanned a period of syncretism in
- |2
                      the Mediterranean world, a fact not without its bearing on the development ofA similar, if theologically less complicated syn-
- |2
                          cretism surrounds the artist, poet, and scientist during the
- |2
                      Renaissance. The “survival of the pagan gods” can
- |2
                      occur then, as during the Middle Ages, because while their pagan attributes
- |2
                      are assimilated by allegory to moral and mystical frameworks, all of which
- |2
                      are guided by Christian principle, their identities as pagan gods are
- |2
                      still preserved in ornamental forms within the work of art. This
- |2
                      “neo-paganism,” as we may call it, had arisen early
- |2
                      in the West and its legacy remains alive even during the Middle Ages,
- |2
                      although only when the Renaissance saw a fresh sense of freedom within
- |2
                      the domain of vision and imagination could the cult of diversity be
- |2
                      permitted to express itself in designs of universal harmony. There is thus
- |2
                      no conflict in the fact that Spenser, in The Faerie
- |2
                          Queene, bases an important episode and much of the detail of his
- |2
                      Fifth Book on “Egyptian” lore, coming from Plutarch,
- |2
                          Of Isis and Osiris, and Lucian, De Syria dea, while allegorically the poet ties
- |2
                      these materials to the legend of Saint George of England, the Arthurian
- |2
                      Legend, fairy lore, and so on, weaving the whole structure with fine
- |2
                      traces of Hermetic philosophy, number symbolism, and the cosmology of
- "                    Giordano Bruno. Such combinations \n"
- |2
                          sus- pend
- |2
                       their elements in a sort of mosaic. On the surface such iconographies
- |2
                      are richly textured and decorated.Piety may be the chief source of syncretic abun-
- |2
                      dance. The allegorist does not wish to lose any of the materials
- |2
                      present to his mind. This is clear in the case of both Homeric and biblical
- |2
                      allegory. A range of motives may contribute to such systematic
- |2
                          “accommo-
- |2
                      dation.” Piety begins with the mystery of the word
- |2
                      itself, spoken in fine verses or written down in magical alphabetic
- |2
                      characters. Ancient allegory also displays a reverence for age, naturally
- |2
                      enough, since men obeyed inherited social, political, and religious
- |2
                      forms of authority. Finally, piety includes the widely held belief
- |2
                      that poets, prophets, lawmakers, priests, and philosophers—wise
- |2
                      men, in short—enjoyed their wis
- |2
                      dom because they were divinely inspired. Inspiration in
- |2
                      particular could account for the jumble of disparate pieces that, over
- |2
                      time, found its way into a sacred canon. The inspired and mystical meaning
- |2
                      was proved rather than disproved by the appearance of arbitrary
- |2
                      inclusion. The more erotic the Song of Songs, the better its candidacy for
- |2
                      allegorical interpretation as a myth of hierogamy between divine and human
- |2
                      partners. Once the alien document is compressed into the overall
- |2
                      vision, its message, assumed to be an inspired revela- tion, takes on a transcendental character, and
- |2
                      allegory must follow.To piety as the conservative force of syncretism may be added its debased
- |2
                      form, superstition. A higher mo- tive, which is
- |2
                      harder to define, is the conciliatory and accommodating desire to permit a
- |2
                      diverse world of many faces and characters. This motive comes into
- |2
                      play when rival world views meet in conflict at their bor- ders, when the opposite impulse would, as with icono- clasm, seek to destroy the rival
- |2
                      iconography. Allegory here becomes a diplomatic medium of thought. Pseudo- Heraclitus, for example, tries
- |2
                      to balance different in- terests in his Homeric Problems (first century A.D.). He claims
- |2
                      that Homer's Apollo represents the sun, in a physical allegory of the
- |2
                      origins of the plague in theIliad, while his concern is with cosmogony in readingIliad XVIII, where the Shield of Achilles becomes
- |2
                      for him a vast cosmological symbol. Yet with these materi- alist readings he aligns others of a different sort,
- |2
                      as when he moralizes Athena to mean wisdom, or Hermes to mean
- |2
                      eloquence and reason. Finally, his overall syncretism stretches to include
- |2
                      a quasi-historical alle- gory, by which the
- |2
                      adultery of Ares and Aphrodite represents the mythic origin of
- |2
                      metalworking, while the ejection of Hephaistos from heaven stands for
- |2
                      the physical discovery that heat can be focussed by mirrors, to create
- |2
                      fire. The immediate aim of these varied inter-
- |2
                          pretations is the defense of Homer against his moraliz- ing detractors, but beyond this, and perhaps more
- |2
                      deeply felt, is the exegete's desire to use Homer as the encyclopedic
- |2
                      container for a wide and disparate vari- ety of
- |2
                      intellectual disciplines. Philosophy ceases to be the framework for Homer;
- |2
                      Homer becomes the frame- work for philosophy.
- |2
                      Homer has attained the canonical status of a sacred literary body.The bolder allegorical syncretisms arise when the elements to be contained
- |2
                      by the allegory are histori- cally
- |2
                      accidental inclusions within an inherited literary corpus. The problem is
- |2
                      clearest with the Old Testa- ment. Origen, who
- |2
                      believes in the mysterious revela- tions of
- |2
                      Scripture, is aware how absurd it is to believe, literally, that God
- |2
                      planted a garden like a farmer, or that He walked about in the garden. With
- |2
                      the New Testament Origen recognized the patently implausibleOrigen is influenced by Philo Judaeus, through the intermediary Clement of
- |2
                      Alexandria, and this Alex- andrian
- |2
                      tradition, which would show parallels in the development of Hellenistic
- |2
                      allegory, suggests that major allegory requires a belief in miracles and
- |2
                          epiphe- nomena, at least on a verbal
- |2
                      level. Origen notes that it is “the most wonderful
- |2
                      thing” that spiritual truths could be veiled under
- |2
                      “stories of wars and conquerors and the conquered,”
- |2
                      and he notes that “the Word of God has arranged for certain
- |2
                      stumbling-blocks, as it were, and hindrances and impossibilities to be
- |2
                      inserted in the midst of the law and the history.” Such
- |2
                      barriers are providential—the more strange they seem, the
- |2
                      more they goad the reader to “learn from the Scrip- tures.” Like many allegorists, Origen can
- |2
                      suddenly undercut his own appearance of caprice. He holds that the
- |2
                      historically true passages are “far more numerous than those
- |2
                      which are composed with purely spiritual meanings.” Yet whenever
- |2
                      a historical scandal appears, he can, if he chooses, fall back on a
- |2
                      spiritual inter- pretation. For this
- |2
                      reason his method has appeared to one of his close students
- |2
                      “unchartably subjective.... Whatever Origen's theory of allegory
- |2
                      may have been, it is quite inaccurate to call his application of its sys- tematic” (Hanson, p. 245). Now,
- |2
                      if allegory is expected to have what Hanson calls
- |2
                      “rules,” it seems clear that Origen and all other
- |2
                      major allegorists are “unchartably subjective.” But
- |2
                      then, so is syncretism in general, and for that reason, in describing his
- |2
                      own work, Dante used his term “polysemous,” or
- |2
                      ambiguous.Yet another approach will demand both more and less from allegorical
- |2
                      syncretism and will perhaps justify its endless prolixity. This approach is
- |2
                      to be found in the Origenist and Philonic belief in the mystery of the
- |2
                      Word. Prophecy assumes that the prophet not only sees the vision of the
- |2
                      truth, but can “speak out” for this vision, sharing
- |2
                      in the divine Logos. Philo may alle- gorize
- |2
                      any portion of the Old Testament, any single image or word, any story, any
- |2
                      disparity or contra
- |2
                      dictory episode. But he does not do this in a spirit of negative
- |2
                      or defensive reaction, but rather as the ex-
- |2
                          pression of an intellectual or speculative freedom. This mode
- |2
                      employs philosophic methods, but Philo is per-
- |2
                      haps less a philosopher than a prophet of philosophy. Thus he may go
- |2
                      beyond the Platonic use of the Ideas as the forms, or paradigms, of things
- |2
                      in the universe, and can hold that the Logos is everywhere immanent in
- |2
                      the cosmos—“the totality of the powers of God
- |2
                      existing within the cosmos itself” (Wolfson, Philo, p. 327). This Logos, unlike the Stoics' material logos,
- |2
                      is immaterial, and on that basis can lead to allegories judged
- |2
                      “unchartably subjective” from the perspective of
- |2
                      natural and human history. Phrased differently, the Philonic use of an
- |2
                      immanent logos directs hermeneutic towards mystery, which is buried within
- |2
                      the Word, whereas the Stoic logos directs it away from mystery towards
- |2
                      reason. Yet Philo and the allegorical tradition stemming from him may not
- |2
                      be identified with the via negativa of the
- |2
                      mystics, since rather than draw his cosmological interpretations into such
- |2
                      a spiritualism of the Logos that they reach evanescence, in a cloud of
- |2
                      unknowing, he draws them toward an infinitely ramified, but consistently
- |2
                      word-centered universe of discourse. What saves his allegory from
- |2
                      irrationality is its recognition that “rationality, when
- |2
                      conceived as complete, as excluding all arbitrariness, becomes itself
- |2
                      a kind of irrationality” (Lovejoy, Great Chain of
- |2
                          Being, p. 331). Philo is continuously interested in the
- |2
                      verbal, linguistic aspect of the Word. He shares the almost immemorial
- |2
                      use of exegetical etymologizing, which is finally canonized in the
- |2
                      encyclopedic Etymologiae of Saint Isidore. If we
- |2
                      broaden the Philonic approach to include images and figures of speech as
- |2
                      well as the literal or referential materials of language, we may speak
- |2
                      of the “logology” of poets and artists as well as of
- |2
                      theologians and philosophers (Burke, Rhetoric of
- |2
                      Religion).The underlying wisdom of the Philonic strain of allegory is its stress on
- |2
                      the freedom of the interpreting mind, on what a seventeenth-century divine
- |2
                      called “the liberty of prophesying.” Its vice is
- |2
                      ingenuity, but its virtue is the corresponding one of a compulsion to
- |2
                      investigate and comment upon the Word and its prog-
- |2
                      eny, words. The noblest document composed with such allegory in mind
- |2
                      is the Fourth Gospel. Common to all such Logos-centered allegories is the
- |2
                      belief that words contain wisdom, and the form in which we inherit
- |2
                      words from the past is itself not without reason, if we can only discover
- |2
                      the inner web of motives that led to the slow formation of that legacy. It
- |2
                      is often said that allegory, outside the specifically historical mode
- |2
                      known as typology, is antihistorical. When morality and ethics are the
- |2
                      reference-point, this is true enough.
- |2
                          Allegory and the Cosmos.
- |2
                       The history of allegory is tuned to the history of cosmological
- |2
                      speculation, so much so that allegory might be defined as figurative
- |2
                      cosmology. Each such fiction presents the image of a universe (and this is
- |2
                      true even of short works), or implies that its details fit into a cosmic
- |2
                      picture. Yet this imagery is not identical with the scientist's use of
- |2
                      theoretical models. The allegorist does not prove and disprove hypotheses
- |2
                      which are then dropped if they fail to hold up as fact. Allegory does not
- |2
                      move toward the certainty of fact; it moves toward tenacity of belief.
- |2
                      Analogy serves the allegorist, as it serves the cosmolo- gist, but here the test of the figurative schema is not its yield of experiment or
- |2
                      observation, but its fertility in leading to still further figuration. The
- |2
                      allegorist treats his universe as if its being were literal, as if it
- |2
                      were a book. Thus there arises the tradition of “book as
- |2
                      symbol,” in which Homer and the Bible hold the first place. Such
- |2
                      works are simply large enough to contain a world of words. In them the cult
- |2
                      of the One gives way to a cult of the Universe.As distinct from the Hellenic, a somewhat less phys-
- |2
                          ical notion of cosmos governs the Hebraic-Christian tradition.
- |2
                      Here, from the encyclopedic resources of the Old Testament come theories of
- |2
                      the Law as the form of the universe. Philo found the Law
- |2
                      “complete and true and good,” and in this total system “anything that seemed to be
- |2
                      lacking in it was really hidden behind the literalness of the words and it
- |2
                      was the task of the student to search it out” (Wolfson, Church Fathers, p. 25). Not necessarily the truth or
- |2
                      the goodness of the Torah led to its exegetical treatment, but rather
- |2
                      its assumed completeness. For Christians this unity carried over into
- |2
                      the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy by events recounted in the New.
- |2
                      The structure of the Bible as it finally evolved into the canonical
- |2
                      Books, bounded by Genesis and the Apocalypse, implies the cosmic
- |2
                      analogy on which its Logos is ordered.Syncretism in ancient Mediterranean religious life raised the question of
- |2
                      universal order, while the in- fluence of
- |2
                      Alexander also led in this direction. The monolithic pretensions of
- |2
                      Augustan Rome may likewise have influenced the strongly allegorical cast of Vergi
- |2
                      lian and Ovidian poetry, so different from Homer. But it was not
- |2
                      until the Middle Ages that the drive toward universal containment and
- |2
                      encirclement led to the complete dominance of allegorical methods. From
- |2
                      the eleventh century onwards influences from Pseudo- Dionysius, Plato, and Plotinus give exegetes a
- |2
                      secure sense of philosophic direction. The Timaeus
- |2
                      and theCelestial Hierarchy provide terms and images. But in
- |2
                      all areas of life this period shows universalist pre- tensions, which Maurice de Wulf characterized simply
- |2
                      as “a tendency toward unity.” Political dreams of a
- |2
                      universal brotherhood, intellectual dreams of a totally organized body of
- |2
                      knowledge, theological dreams of a total theological summa—these were the natural background for
- |2
                      allegorical literature. Bernard of Clairvaux finds infinite detail in a
- |2
                      closed world, by imagining four infinitely reflexive
- |2
                      “mirrors” of knowl-
- |2
                      edge—the natural, intellectual, moral, and historical.
- |2
                      Dante's Commendia, whose form and setting rival the
- |2
                      universe, finds a parallel in his De monarchia, a
- |2
                      theory of political unification. By symmetry the actual physi- cal universe is converted into a symbol,
- |2
                      and we can speak of a “symbolic mentality” which
- |2
                      denied the more immediate puzzles presented by the senses. The flight
- |2
                      from the limited toward the infinity of the Divine Being kept its balance
- |2
                      only, if at all, by asserting that man's world was closed and finite.
- |2
                      Ockham's principle of parsimony was invented, it seems, to stem this icon- ographic tide, since scholastic
- |2
                      thought, at first ration- alizing, ends by
- |2
                      absorbing the medieval compulsion to turn relations into icons.In a sense allegory thrives even more abundantly during the Renaissance,
- |2
                      because the new cosmology does not at once drive out the old, so that
- |2
                      visionary and scientific cosmologies coexist, their very difference
- |2
                      enriching the imagery of poets and theologians. The main development of the
- |2
                      mode is the gradual rejection of the theory of
- |2
                      “levels” of meaning. Most allegorists have in fact
- |2
                      used two levels, whatever they may have claimed to do. They take a sentence
- |2
                      and give it a double meaning. At its simplest this process will be
- |2
                      seen in the parables of Christ. Clement of Alexandria, however,
- |2
                      distinguished four levels on which he could read a sacred text, a literal
- |2
                      level and three subsidiary symbolic stages, the moral, physical, and
- |2
                      theological. Origen held that as man is made of body, soul, and
- |2
                      spirit, so interpretation must yield three levels of meaning, the literal,
- |2
                      moral, and spiritual. Jerome in- voked the
- |2
                      literal, tropological, and mystical. Augustine held that all readings of
- |2
                      Scripture, however structured, should express charity, yet he too could
- |2
                      speak of a hierarchy of levels, for instance, historical,
- |2
                      aetiological, analogical, and allegorical (De utilitate
- |2
                          credendi, 3.5). What became the classical formulation of ChristianWhat was once available only to the instructed interpreter is now the common
- |2
                      property of the experi- encing subject. It
- |2
                      is an error, however, to believe that romantic
- |2
                      “symbolism” destroys allegory, although it loosens
- |2
                      and reorders the “levels” on which texts are made and
- |2
                      read. Shelley's Prometheus Unbound is as much an
- |2
                      allegory as the Psychomachia of Prudentius
- |2
                      (348-?410). Where the mode radically declines in force is not as a creative
- |2
                      method, but in the interpretive divisions of theology, where the new
- |2
                      criticism of the Bible, with its scientific research into textual
- |2
                      evolution, raises questions about the literary level which are so
- |2
                      searching that the dependent symbolic levels pale in theological
- |2
                      importance.
- |2
                          Allegory and Time.
- |2
                       “Rationality has nothing to do with dates.”
- |2
                      Thus Lovejoy epitomized the static and “absolutely
- |2
                      rigid” form of the Great Chain of Being as it had set up the
- |2
                      framework of traditional allegory. The stasis of hierarchy is mirrored in
- |2
                      the markedly static character of most allegorical fictions, be they
- |2
                      stories, dramas, lyrics, or whatever. Allegorical narra- tive yields a fixated image of change, in which
- |2
                      time is synchronic, never diachronic. Augustine imagines human destiny
- |2
                      in the shape of a city, following the Book of Revelation. Joachim of Floris
- |2
                      diagrams history as an allegorical tree with stems and branches. Time
- |2
                      becomes a hypostatized form of becoming.Two aspects of the mode are thus historically prob-
- |2
                          lematic. (1) The Hebraic-Christian belief in prophecy asserts
- |2
                      that historical figures may prefigure other his-
- |2
                          torical figures, Joshua becoming the “type” of
- |2
                      Jesus. Scholars have held that the historicity of the figurae radically differentiates them from allegorical
- |2
                      emblems, such as the anchor of faith. Yet the typological figure is
- |2
                      under constant pressure to revert to a timeless sym-
- |2
                      bol, since typology in fact is collapsing the diachronic time-span
- |2
                      and stopping the fluent openness of time by envisioning miraculous kairoi, or prophetic moments when time
- |2
                      “stands still.” (2) Modern science attacks the
- |2
                      fixation of allegory in yet another quarter, and here perhaps there exists
- |2
                      a possibility of a radical change in the allegorical method. During and
- |2
                      after the Renais- sance new methods arise
- |2
                      for the analysis and explora
- |2
                      tion of the origins of things, along with
- |2
                      their progres- sive development away from
- |2
                      those origins. The text of the Bible is one such object of study, but the
- |2
                      physical universe and the historical world of men are more crucial. In
- |2
                      the Monads of Bruno and Leibniz the Great Chain of Being is
- |2
                      “temporalized,” as the closed world of Ptolemy, so
- |2
                      useful to the poet's need for a cosmos, gives way to an infinite universe.Even more upsetting is the discovery of anthro-
- |2
                          pological development. With the Renaissance a some- what aesthetic cult of Euhemerus arises, finding
- |2
                      human origins for the gods, who are regarded as divinized heroes. Such
- |2
                      beliefs lead, along with new historical and archeological knowledge, to new
- |2
                      theories of human evolution, beginning with primitive forms and advanc- ing to more complex societies. After
- |2
                      Vico it is no longer possible for mythology or iconography to divorce
- |2
                      itself from temporal change. First the philosophes
- |2
                      of the Enlightenment debunk the allegorizing of the gods and daemons,
- |2
                      then the ground shifts under all forms of imagination, so that
- |2
                      developmental myths take over from the former static world view. The
- |2
                      “new allegor- ism”
- |2
                      tends to be more monolithic than the old, permit-
- |2
                          ting a single theory of change, whatever it may be, to explain
- |2
                      various possible modes of change.
- |2
                          Allegory and Decorum.
- |2
                       While a large view may portend the general undermining of allegory in
- |2
                      the modern period, the close-up analysis of allegory makes this appear
- |2
                      an unlikely development. Allegories are, as a symbolic mode, composed of
- |2
                      ornaments—not, strictly speaking, metaphors. Thus, the Greek
- |2
                      term for the larger outlines of a major allegory would be kosmos, while in classical Greek the same term does double
- |2
                      duty for the rhetorician's “ornament.” The same
- |2
                      double usage appears in Latin decus, which grows
- |2
                      into the English terms “decoration” and
- |2
                      “decorum.” Allegory expresses the interplay of little
- |2
                      and great worlds, which are ornamentally reflecting surfaces of microcosm
- |2
                      and macrocosm.There is no reason to suppose that men will cease to decorate themselves or
- |2
                      fail to recognize decorum. But modes of ornament continuously change. Con- ceivably the present world, with its
- |2
                      increased stand- ardization of artifacts
- |2
                      and its diminishing barriers to travel, will see the speeding-up of
- |2
                      allegorical processes. Whether revolutions undermine or reorder
- |2
                      cosmologies has become the allegorist's chief problem. Allegory can no
- |2
                      longer be what for centuries it had tried to be, the image of permanence in
- |2
                      a world of flux. Franz Kafka is perhaps the greatest allegorical writer of
- |2
                      modern times, and his work revels in cloudy interactions be- tween wierdly undefined characters. Yet Kafka
- |2
                      looks at this obscure scene with microscopic delicacy. He bases his
- |2
                      fictions largely upon “the Law,” on which,Generally speaking, modern allegory shows sings of breaking down many of the
- |2
                      normal divisions between things, either by use of dream-mechanisms or by
- |2
                      other surrealistic devices. The mode is creatively perhaps most alive
- |2
                      in science-fiction, but it permeates the art of advertising, wherever
- |2
                      decoration and decorum are the primary commercial interests.
- |2
                      Philosophically and theologically there is less place for allegory than
- |2
                      in earlier centuries, but one can discern traces of it in the
- |2
                      subjectivism of the phenomenologist's concept of transcendence, and in the
- |2
                      actual use of fiction by ex- istentialist
- |2
                      authors (for example, the novels of Camus, or earlier, the quasi-fictional
- |2
                      treatises of Kierkegaard). As in previous times, the allegorist can today
- |2
                      use many different media, including music (with
- |2
                      “programs” and leitmotifs) and the visual arts (with
- |2
                      emblems and icons).General discussions: Kenneth Burke, The Rhetoric of

  \               ALLEGORY INLITERARY HISTORY\n                In the expansion of
  Western thought allegory has\n                    played a major part from the earliest
  times to the present. Allegories have\n                    taken many forms, from
  mere emblems like the eagle and the dove, to the\n                    simple fables
  of Aesop and parables of Christ, to vast poetic\n                    structures
  like The Divine Comedy and equally large\n                    forms like the patristic
  glosses and commentaries on the Bible. Essentially\n                    a means
  of structuring language so as to produce continuously linked series\n                    of
  double or multiple meanings, this symbols mode depends largely upon\n                    syncretic
  mixtures of symbols from which it builds up “levels of\n                    meaning,”
  sometimes as few as two, or as many as seven.\n                    Minimally it
  holds that no single literal meaning can stand alone, but that\n                    a
  valid utterance must possess a transcendent meaning as well, a\n                    symbolic
  surplus beyond the literal level. Most alle- gories are images of cosmic order,
  and their fixed,\n                    hierarchical, and timeless character becomes
  problem- atic whenever such cosmic orders are subjected to\n                    temporal
  analysis. The key to the permanence of al-\n                        legory throughout
  history appears to be its ornamental surface,\n                    which allies
  it with changes in cosmology and decorum and gives it an\n                    exploratory
  as well as a tradi- tional and\n                    conservationist function.\n
  \               \n                        Terminology.\n                     Following
  classical tradition, the sev-\n                        enth-century scholar Isidore
  of Seville called allegory an\n                    inversion of speech, alieni loquium,
  aliud enim sonat,\n                        aliud intelligitur, whereby, in saying
  one thing\n                     a person conveys or understands something else (\n
  \                       Ety- mologiae\n                     I, 47.22). Such deceptively
  simple formulas, which abound in the\n                    history of allegory, suggest,
  if nothing else, the fundamentally oblique\n                    character of this
  symbolic mode. When Saint Augustine speaks of\n                    “a mode of speech
  in which one thing is understood by\n                    another,” his very open
  definition is based on the assumption\n                    that some primary or
  literal\n                    (ῥητη̂) level of sense\n                    may include
  another secondary or even more remote sense, which the trained\n                    interpreter
  will seek out through a process of reflection. Such\n                    secondary
  meanings may be imposed upon a text, or an author may\n                    clearly
  build them into a text, but no clear dis-\n                        tinction separates
  the interpretive and creative aspects of\n                    allegory, since the
  two are poles in a single commu- nicative method. The allegorical poet encodes an\n
  \                   oblique, multiple (Dante called it a “polysemous”)\n                    meaning
  in his fiction, using emblems and iconographic devices, for\n                    example,
  the scythe of time, or the apple of discord, and the stories that\n                    go
  with them.\n                The allegorical interpreter decodes this same com-\n
  \                   plex message, which assumes that allegory is a struc- tural
  reality within the text. Nevertheless, though\n                        al- legory
  may exist in a text as a\n                    structure, the key to this structure
  is usually found in some system of\n                    values or ideas that lies
  outside the immediate context.\n                    “The allegorical method means
  the interpretation of a text\n                    in terms of something else, irrespective
  of what that something else is.\n                    That something else may be
  book learning, it may be practical wisdom, or it\n                    may be one's
  inner consciousness. All these are matters which depend\n                    upon
  external circumstances” (Wolfson, Philo, I, 134). Allegory thus not only assumes
  a certain stabil- ity of literal meaning, but also the\n                    legitimacy
  of a movement back and forth between that literal meaning\n                    and
  some external frame of reference. In the history of the mode both\n                    creators
  and interpreters have en- joyed wide\n                    freedom in the ways they
  have understood the internal and external\n                    dimensions of their
  texts, and the historian is faced with a bewildering\n                    variety
  of allegorical procedures. Theologians, however, have often\n                    sought
  to systematize the allegorical method.\n                A plethora of traditional
  technical terms conveys the encyclopedic spirit of\n                    this procedure.
  Hardly an idea in the history of Western thought has failed\n                    to
  find allegorical expression, at some period or other. Major\n                    allegorists
  like Dante and Spenser have often summed up the world views of\n                    their
  time. The term “allegory” itself comes from the\n                    teachings of
  Greco-Roman rhet- oricians,\n                    Demetrius, Cicero, Quintilian,
  and others, who take it to mean a series of\n                    linked metaphors,
  as exemplified in Horace's Ode (I,\n                    14), in which the poet elaborates
  on the “ship of\n                    state,” subdividing the single main figure
  of speech into a\n                    series of nautical/political042\n                     parallels.
  Unlike the single metaphor, however, alle- gory tends to depart from the world of
  sense- experience, moving toward\n                    rumination. Metaphor sees,
  but allegory thinks, and thus often creates an\n                    effect of geometric
  abstraction. Allegory is furthermore highly\n                    ornamental, using
  elaborate symbolism and personification.\n                Deriving from Greek allos
  + agoreuein\n                    (“other + speak out”), allegory implies only the
  most\n                    general kind of semantic doubling, and classical rhetoric
  draws rather\n                    uncertain lines between allegory and other fig-\n
  \                   ures of speech, metaphor, synecdoche, metonymy, and the like.
  It\n                    associates allegory with notions of design, with terms like
  paradeigma and schema,\n                    and later critics link allegory with
  figura,\n                    impresa, and emblema, which point\n                    to
  vision, structure, and external form.\n                By contrast the older Greek
  term for allegorical meaning refers us to a\n                    veiling function
  of language.Hyponoia\n                    (ὑπόνοια) was\n                    the
  term which, Plutarch tells us (De audiendis\n                    poetic 4.19), the
  “ancients” had used, and\n                    it implies a hidden meaning, a conjectural
  or suppositious sense, buried\n                        under the literal surface.
  Plato (Republic II. 378d), Euripides (Phoenicians 1131-33), Aristophanes (Frogs\n
  \                   1425-31), Xenophon (Symposium III, 6), all use hyponoia to mean
  what is later subsumed under\n                    allegory (Pépin, pp. 85-86). \n
  \                       Hy- ponoia\n                     furthermore has a noetic
  character; the reader or listener will have\n                    to think his way
  through a se- mantic barrier,\n                    beyond which lies a realm of
  mystic knowledge. Thus Philo Judaeus may\n                    equate the \n                        hy-
  ponoia\n                     of a text with its latent theme, its mystery, its secret,
  its\n                    unexpressed, unseen, nonliteral, or simply intelligible
  meaning. While\n                    theological and other ex- egetes stress the\n
  \                   mysteries of allegory, and classical rhetoric stresses its semantic
  form,\n                    analyzing the shift from hidden to open meaning as a
  semantic\n                    inversion, both exegetes and rhetoricians alike possess
  a large store\n                    of technical synonyms, among them parabole, typos,\n
  \                       fabula, symbolon, ennoia, fictio, figmentum, insinuatio,
  significatio,\n                        similitudo, figura, imago, inter-\n                        pretatio,
  involucrum, integumentum. Some of these\n                    terms define the “external
  circumstances” of allegory\n                    as a theological framework, others
  as philosophy, still others as rhetoric\n                    or poetics. In most
  of the terms obliquity and mystery are the chief\n                    emphasis.
  Augus- tine observes in his De doctrina (2.7-8) that “when\n                    something
  is searched for with difficulty it is, as a result, more\n                    delightfully
  discovered.”\n                If an ascetic interpretive rigor is one main source
  of pleasure in allegory,\n                    exegetical intricacy is the vice of
  the mode. From a certain angle allegory\n                    is merely a mode of
  systematic commentary upon a text, as opposed to\n                    an unmediated,
  direct, or literal reading of the text, and thus exegesis\n                    must
  depart from its\n                     source in the text. This departure may become
  ob- sessive. Dante labels his Commedia\n                    “digressive,” while
  typically the medieval\n                    commentator ringed his text with marginalia.
  The medieval distinction\n                    between a gloss and a commentary allowed
  the latter to stray further\n                    from the literal sense. The interpreter
  often thought of himself as boring\n                    his way through a “rind”
  or\n                    “bark,” so as to allow the hidden symbolic truth to\n                    flow
  outward from the textual center. In the Middle Ages at least a text\n                    would
  be valued in the measure to which its lode of inner meaning appeared\n                    to
  defy exhaustion.\n                \n                        Continuities in the
  History of Allegory.\n                     A literary method which encourages the
  search for multiplicity\n                    of sense is bound to provoke attack
  from rationalist quarters, a situation\n                    we observe with Plato,
  whose rejection of the poets from his ideal republic\n                    includes
  a rejection of the allegorical defense of Homeric myth. Early\n                    Greek
  philosophers, among them Heraclitus and Pythagoras, had found a piety\n                    toward
  god, nature, and man in apparently scandalous passages concerning\n                    the
  gods. Philosophy inverted myth, so that, for example, the jealousy\n                    of
  a god would “truly” represent the physical\n                    activity of a natural
  force. Such a means of saving Homer for morality\n                    proved both
  superficial and irrational in the light of Plato's dialectical\n                    analysis.
  For Plato this allegorical transformation of evil-minded\n                    myths
  did more harm than good, for it permitted the continuance of poetry\n                    in
  preference to the higher pursuit of philosophy. The wisdom saved thereby\n                    was,
  in principle, sophistry. Ironically, Plato himself pro- vided the most substantial
  mechanism and\n                    authority for the persistence of Western allegory.\n
  \               The Platonic theory of ideas has two aspects which lead to allegorical\n
  \                   interpretations of both signs and things, provided the overarching\n
  \                   authority of dialectic is allowed to fade from sight. In the
  first place\n                    the ideas may be taken to constitute the formulas,
  if not exactly the\n                    forms, by which the allegorist's “some-\n
  \                       thing” is interpreted as\n                    “something
  else.” If the snake is an emblem of\n                    jealousy, then it is the
  idea jealousy that\n                    organizes the “coaptation” of the snake
  for this\n                    symbolic purpose. To speak of “the idea of a thing”\n
  \                   is almost to invoke the allegorical process, for the idea transcends
  the\n                    thing, much as the allegorist's fiction departs from the
  literal sense of\n                    an utterance. Yet this is not the strongest
  Platonic support for allegory,\n                        pow- erful though it is.\n
  \               More important is the Platonic arrangement of the theory of ideas
  as a vast\n                    hierarchical construct, from lower to higher forms.
  By adopting the\n                    “principle of plenitude,” the notion that an\n
  \                   intelligible world would possess all possible forms of all possible\n
  \                   things—as the effluence of the One—Plato answered the allegorist's043\n
  \                    encyclopedic demand for a plenitude of\n                    “somethings”
  by which to symbolize his\n                    “anythings.” Plenitude also implied
  an infinitely\n                    subdivided universe, while it led to an otherworldly
  tendency within the\n                    whole ap- proach to life, such that a\n
  \                   Platonizing allegorist would always be happy to think of X in
  terms of Y,\n                    since this would achieve transcendency beyond the
  bonds of mere\n                    material reference. By questioning the essential
  value of material nature,\n                    the Platonic dialectic opens the
  way to a spiritualizing of nature, and in\n                    the case of Plato
  himself this leads to the use of allegory pre- cisely at the moment in his dialogues
  when\n                    the analysis of nature has reached the highest point of
  transcend- ence describable in natural,\n                    human terms. At that
  point a leap of iconographic faith takes place, as in\n                    the vision
  of love Diotima gives Socrates, when the realistic and\n                    human
  drama of the Symposium gives way to a\n                        “con- ceptual\n                    myth,”
  a spiritual diagram of a love which cannot be represented\n                    “in
  terms of” ordinary human experience. The Platonic\n                    use of allegory,
  itself alle- gorized in the\n                    Myth of the Cave, reaches a climax
  in the Timaeus.\n                    There, since the universe is not explicable
  in purely natural terms, its\n                    ideal character is permitted to
  surge up in a fanciful, visionary theory of\n                    cosmic order.\n
  \               The Platonic example may be archetypal for the history of allegory,
  in that\n                    his attack upon Homeric allegorizing is not as general
  or consistent as at\n                    first it seems. He is perhaps open to the
  charge that he is attacking\n                    any allegory which differs in its
  frame of reference from his own.\n                    Throughout the complex de-
  velopment of\n                    Hebraic-Christian exegesis such private invectives
  are common. The\n                    Christian exegetes attack their pagan counterparts,
  and then proceed to\n                    employ the rejected hermeneutic method.\n
  \               At the same time, while rejection and resistance to allegory occur\n
  \                   periodically within and between con- tending\n                    schools
  of thought, the method can survive attack largely because its\n                    principle
  of semantic inver- sion enables the\n                    allegorist to shift his
  ground freely whenever an opponent questions him.\n                    Since in
  the theological context of most serious ancient allegory\n                    there
  is scarcely room for a scientific theory of lan-\n                        guage,
  since, in short, language is here a means of revelation,\n                    there
  seems to have been no way for the allegorist to gain perspective on\n                    his
  own activity. By the second century A.D., as a treatise like Plutarch'sOf Isis and
  Osiris will show, a multiplicity of Medi- terranean religions had grown up,\n                    yielding
  an unre- strained exchange of\n                    figures between variant faiths,
  each one providing the materials for\n                    iconography within the
  framework of some other faith.\n                In spite of the intricacy of much
  exegesis the mode generally depends for\n                    its force upon the
  belief that\n                     words have magical power, a belief that is evident
  in the\n                    influential treatises of Pseudo-Dionysius, On the\n
  \                       Celestial Hierarchy and On the Divine Names.\n                    Plotinus
  had already systematized the hierarchical aspect of the\n                    Platonic
  ideas, giving to each hypostasis of the One a particular magical\n                    quantum
  of effluence and in- fluence. Within\n                    such frameworks allegory
  can play a double role. In its Neo-Platonic aspect\n                    it looks
  “up- ward” to a\n                    transcendental plane of purer Being, but at
  the same time it retains the\n                    primitivist drive of a language
  system in which every term has its own\n                    share of magical force.
  By the same token most allegorical fictions\n                    are romantic myths,
  in which the characters make full use of magical\n                    weapons, vehicles,
  settings, and quests. The history of allegory is,\n                    strictly
  speaking, not the history of rival theologies and philosophies.\n                    The
  logic of allegory is only remotely rationalistic. Instead, we\n                    observe
  a struggle of magic-thinking to survive within a climate of\n                    ever-increasing
  intellectual and semantic sophistication. This is the more\n                    curious
  in the light of the allegorist's frequent pretense of being logi- cal and rational.
  The pretense covers the\n                    true situation, which is that allegories
  are strict in the manner of\n                    magic rituals, substituting mechanical
  for rational rigor.\n                \n                        Allegorical Syncretism.\n
  \                    The creation and inter- pretation\n                    of allegorical
  texts seems to depend on an acceptance of syncretism, the\n                    kind
  of colloidal mixture of religious, philosophical, and cultural beliefs\n                    which
  particularly marks the Hellenistic Age, the second century A.D.,\n                    and
  the High Renaissance, although in the Renaissance syncretism is\n                    strongly
  aesthetic in its combination of elements. Syncretism may be icono- graphically distinguished
  from\n                    synthesis, insofar as the former preserves the individual
  traits of the\n                    combining beliefs, whereas the latter would achieve
  a radical\n                    transformation of disparate cultural forces, until
  a sin- gle set among them came to dominate and control the\n                    assimilation
  of other sets as minor premisses in the logic of the culture\n                    as
  a whole. Syncretism is the cult of diversity within a culture yearning\n                    for
  unified order. It is often to be associated with gnostic\n                    spirituality,
  since the experience of gnosis\n                    includes a transcendence of
  the multiplicity of faiths by entertaining all\n                    their claims
  on an equal footing. Thus Gnosticism finds its sources in\n                    Greek
  Orphism, Pythagoreanism, Mazdean dualism, Jewish apocalyptic,\n                    Egyptian
  mystery- religions,\n                    Hellenistic astrological cult, and various
  kinds of numerology,\n                    “along with the crass 'spirituality' of
  mediums, quacks, and\n                    religious adventurers” (Grant,Roman Hellenism,
  p. 74).\n                The early centuries of Christian expansion spanned a period
  of syncretism in\n                    the Mediterranean world, a fact not without
  its bearing on the development of044\n                     Christian exegesis. The
  Alexandrian School, most nota- bly Clement and Origen, who anticipated the visions\n
  \                   of the fourth-century fathers, Basil of Caesarea, Gregory Nazianzen,
  and\n                    Gregory of Nyssa, introduced key notions from Greek philosophy,
  which was\n                    given authority for them by the syncretism of Philo,
  who, although a\n                    Jew, stands at the head of this tradition.
  The broadly allegorical\n                    structure of Augustine's two cities,
  of God and Man, may owe something to\n                    his own syncretic background.
  In such a climate the religious convert\n                    may bring remnants
  of his former faith with him into the new faith.\n                    Syncretism
  has this great ad- vantage for the\n                    allegorist: it gathers in,
  rather than expels; but at the same time it\n                    preserves the sense
  of diverse origins and intellectual styles.\n                A similar, if theologically
  less complicated syn-\n                        cretism surrounds the artist, poet,
  and scientist during the\n                    Renaissance. The “survival of the
  pagan gods” can\n                    occur then, as during the Middle Ages, because
  while their pagan attributes\n                    are assimilated by allegory to
  moral and mystical frameworks, all of which\n                    are guided by Christian
  principle, their identities as pagan gods are\n                    still preserved
  in ornamental forms within the work of art. This\n                    “neo-paganism,”
  as we may call it, had arisen early\n                    in the West and its legacy
  remains alive even during the Middle Ages,\n                    although only when
  the Renaissance saw a fresh sense of freedom within\n                    the domain
  of vision and imagination could the cult of diversity be\n                    permitted
  to express itself in designs of universal harmony. There is thus\n                    no
  conflict in the fact that Spenser, in The Faerie\n                        Queene,
  bases an important episode and much of the detail of his\n                    Fifth
  Book on “Egyptian” lore, coming from Plutarch,\n                        Of Isis
  and Osiris, and Lucian, De Syria dea, while allegorically the poet ties\n                    these
  materials to the legend of Saint George of England, the Arthurian\n                    Legend,
  fairy lore, and so on, weaving the whole structure with fine\n                    traces
  of Hermetic philosophy, number symbolism, and the cosmology of\n                    Giordano
  Bruno. Such combinations \n                        sus- pend\n                     their
  elements in a sort of mosaic. On the surface such iconographies\n                    are
  richly textured and decorated.\n                Piety may be the chief source of
  syncretic abun-\n                    dance. The allegorist does not wish to lose
  any of the materials\n                    present to his mind. This is clear in
  the case of both Homeric and biblical\n                    allegory. A range of
  motives may contribute to such systematic\n                        “accommo-\n                    dation.”
  Piety begins with the mystery of the word\n                    itself, spoken in
  fine verses or written down in magical alphabetic\n                    characters.
  Ancient allegory also displays a reverence for age, naturally\n                    enough,
  since men obeyed inherited social, political, and religious\n                    forms
  of authority. Finally, piety includes the widely held belief\n                    that
  poets, prophets, lawmakers, priests, and philosophers—wise\n                    men,
  in short—enjoyed their wis\n                    dom because they were divinely inspired.
  Inspiration in\n                    particular could account for the jumble of disparate
  pieces that, over\n                    time, found its way into a sacred canon.
  The inspired and mystical meaning\n                    was proved rather than disproved
  by the appearance of arbitrary\n                    inclusion. The more erotic the
  Song of Songs, the better its candidacy for\n                    allegorical interpretation
  as a myth of hierogamy between divine and human\n                    partners. Once
  the alien document is compressed into the overall\n                    vision, its
  message, assumed to be an inspired revela- tion, takes on a transcendental character,
  and\n                    allegory must follow.\n                To piety as the
  conservative force of syncretism may be added its debased\n                    form,
  superstition. A higher mo- tive, which is\n                    harder to define,
  is the conciliatory and accommodating desire to permit a\n                    diverse
  world of many faces and characters. This motive comes into\n                    play
  when rival world views meet in conflict at their bor- ders, when the opposite impulse
  would, as with icono- clasm, seek to destroy the rival\n                    iconography.
  Allegory here becomes a diplomatic medium of thought. Pseudo- Heraclitus, for example,
  tries\n                    to balance different in- terests in his Homeric Problems
  (first century A.D.). He claims\n                    that Homer's Apollo represents
  the sun, in a physical allegory of the\n                    origins of the plague
  in theIliad, while his concern is with cosmogony in readingIliad XVIII, where the
  Shield of Achilles becomes\n                    for him a vast cosmological symbol.
  Yet with these materi- alist readings he aligns others of a different sort,\n                    as
  when he moralizes Athena to mean wisdom, or Hermes to mean\n                    eloquence
  and reason. Finally, his overall syncretism stretches to include\n                    a
  quasi-historical alle- gory, by which the\n                    adultery of Ares
  and Aphrodite represents the mythic origin of\n                    metalworking,
  while the ejection of Hephaistos from heaven stands for\n                    the
  physical discovery that heat can be focussed by mirrors, to create\n                    fire.
  The immediate aim of these varied inter-\n                        pretations is
  the defense of Homer against his moraliz- ing detractors, but beyond this, and perhaps
  more\n                    deeply felt, is the exegete's desire to use Homer as the
  encyclopedic\n                    container for a wide and disparate vari- ety of\n
  \                   intellectual disciplines. Philosophy ceases to be the framework
  for Homer;\n                    Homer becomes the frame- work for philosophy.\n
  \                   Homer has attained the canonical status of a sacred literary
  body.\n                The bolder allegorical syncretisms arise when the elements
  to be contained\n                    by the allegory are histori- cally\n                    accidental
  inclusions within an inherited literary corpus. The problem is\n                    clearest
  with the Old Testa- ment. Origen, who\n                    believes in the mysterious
  revela- tions of\n                    Scripture, is aware how absurd it is to believe,
  literally, that God\n                    planted a garden like a farmer, or that
  He walked about in the garden. With\n                    the New Testament Origen
  recognized the patently implausible045\n                     character of the story
  that the Devil could show the kingdoms\n                    of the earth from a
  single mountain top. “And the careful reader\n                    will detect thousands
  of other passages in the gospels like this, which\n                    will convince
  him that events which did not take place at all are\n                    woven into
  the records of what literally did happen” (De principiis IV.3.1). The allegorist
  therefore\n                    proposes to supplant the literal inconsistency by
  a spiritual\n                    equivalent possessed of inner truth, precisely,
  in short, what had been\n                    veiled by the inconsistent literal
  surface. Believing that “the\n                    skillful plan of [God] the provi-
  dential\n                    ruler is not so clear in things on earth as it is in
  regard to the sun and\n                    moon and stars,” Origen asserts the revelatory
  function of\n                    language when deal- ing with sacred literature.\n
  \               Origen is influenced by Philo Judaeus, through the intermediary
  Clement of\n                    Alexandria, and this Alex- andrian\n                    tradition,
  which would show parallels in the development of Hellenistic\n                    allegory,
  suggests that major allegory requires a belief in miracles and\n                        epiphe-
  nomena, at least on a verbal\n                    level. Origen notes that it is
  “the most wonderful\n                    thing” that spiritual truths could be veiled
  under\n                    “stories of wars and conquerors and the conquered,”\n
  \                   and he notes that “the Word of God has arranged for certain\n
  \                   stumbling-blocks, as it were, and hindrances and impossibilities
  to be\n                    inserted in the midst of the law and the history.” Such\n
  \                   barriers are providential—the more strange they seem, the\n
  \                   more they goad the reader to “learn from the Scrip- tures.”
  Like many allegorists, Origen can\n                    suddenly undercut his own
  appearance of caprice. He holds that the\n                    historically true
  passages are “far more numerous than those\n                    which are composed
  with purely spiritual meanings.” Yet whenever\n                    a historical
  scandal appears, he can, if he chooses, fall back on a\n                    spiritual
  inter- pretation. For this\n                    reason his method has appeared to
  one of his close students\n                    “unchartably subjective.... Whatever
  Origen's theory of allegory\n                    may have been, it is quite inaccurate
  to call his application of its sys- tematic” (Hanson, p. 245). Now,\n                    if
  allegory is expected to have what Hanson calls\n                    “rules,” it
  seems clear that Origen and all other\n                    major allegorists are
  “unchartably subjective.” But\n                    then, so is syncretism in general,
  and for that reason, in describing his\n                    own work, Dante used
  his term “polysemous,” or\n                    ambiguous.\n                Yet another
  approach will demand both more and less from allegorical\n                    syncretism
  and will perhaps justify its endless prolixity. This approach is\n                    to
  be found in the Origenist and Philonic belief in the mystery of the\n                    Word.
  Prophecy assumes that the prophet not only sees the vision of the\n                    truth,
  but can “speak out” for this vision, sharing\n                    in the divine
  Logos. Philo may alle- gorize\n                    any portion of the Old Testament,
  any single image or word, any story, any\n                    disparity or contra\n
  \                   dictory episode. But he does not do this in a spirit of negative\n
  \                   or defensive reaction, but rather as the ex-\n                        pression
  of an intellectual or speculative freedom. This mode\n                    employs
  philosophic methods, but Philo is per-\n                    haps less a philosopher
  than a prophet of philosophy. Thus he may go\n                    beyond the Platonic
  use of the Ideas as the forms, or paradigms, of things\n                    in the
  universe, and can hold that the Logos is everywhere immanent in\n                    the
  cosmos—“the totality of the powers of God\n                    existing within the
  cosmos itself” (Wolfson, Philo, p. 327). This Logos, unlike the Stoics' material
  logos,\n                    is immaterial, and on that basis can lead to allegories
  judged\n                    “unchartably subjective” from the perspective of\n                    natural
  and human history. Phrased differently, the Philonic use of an\n                    immanent
  logos directs hermeneutic towards mystery, which is buried within\n                    the
  Word, whereas the Stoic logos directs it away from mystery towards\n                    reason.
  Yet Philo and the allegorical tradition stemming from him may not\n                    be
  identified with the via negativa of the\n                    mystics, since rather
  than draw his cosmological interpretations into such\n                    a spiritualism
  of the Logos that they reach evanescence, in a cloud of\n                    unknowing,
  he draws them toward an infinitely ramified, but consistently\n                    word-centered
  universe of discourse. What saves his allegory from\n                    irrationality
  is its recognition that “rationality, when\n                    conceived as complete,
  as excluding all arbitrariness, becomes itself\n                    a kind of irrationality”
  (Lovejoy, Great Chain of\n                        Being, p. 331). Philo is continuously
  interested in the\n                    verbal, linguistic aspect of the Word. He
  shares the almost immemorial\n                    use of exegetical etymologizing,
  which is finally canonized in the\n                    encyclopedic Etymologiae
  of Saint Isidore. If we\n                    broaden the Philonic approach to include
  images and figures of speech as\n                    well as the literal or referential
  materials of language, we may speak\n                    of the “logology” of poets
  and artists as well as of\n                    theologians and philosophers (Burke,
  Rhetoric of\n                    Religion).\n                The underlying wisdom
  of the Philonic strain of allegory is its stress on\n                    the freedom
  of the interpreting mind, on what a seventeenth-century divine\n                    called
  “the liberty of prophesying.” Its vice is\n                    ingenuity, but its
  virtue is the corresponding one of a compulsion to\n                    investigate
  and comment upon the Word and its prog-\n                    eny, words. The noblest
  document composed with such allegory in mind\n                    is the Fourth
  Gospel. Common to all such Logos-centered allegories is the\n                    belief
  that words contain wisdom, and the form in which we inherit\n                    words
  from the past is itself not without reason, if we can only discover\n                    the
  inner web of motives that led to the slow formation of that legacy. It\n                    is
  often said that allegory, outside the specifically historical mode\n                    known
  as typology, is antihistorical. When morality and ethics are the\n                    reference-point,
  this is true enough.046\n                     But because words are an essential
  mechanism of human thought,\n                    their recorded forms of combination
  and formation are primary resources of\n                    the historian, and the
  allegorist's accommodative impulse includes a\n                    desire to preserve
  these resources, rather than see them destroyed by\n                    advances
  or regressions of a cultural set. When the ancient gloss\n                    identifies
  Zeus as “life,” be-\n                        cause his name coincides with the Greek
  word for life, an\n                    element of history enters the interpretation
  through what may be a false\n                    etymology. Such equations hold
  that the universe is coherent when read as a\n                    logos.\n                \n
  \                       Allegory and the Cosmos.\n                     The history
  of allegory is tuned to the history of cosmological\n                    speculation,
  so much so that allegory might be defined as figurative\n                    cosmology.
  Each such fiction presents the image of a universe (and this is\n                    true
  even of short works), or implies that its details fit into a cosmic\n                    picture.
  Yet this imagery is not identical with the scientist's use of\n                    theoretical
  models. The allegorist does not prove and disprove hypotheses\n                    which
  are then dropped if they fail to hold up as fact. Allegory does not\n                    move
  toward the certainty of fact; it moves toward tenacity of belief.\n                    Analogy
  serves the allegorist, as it serves the cosmolo- gist, but here the test of the
  figurative schema is not its yield of experiment or\n                    observation,
  but its fertility in leading to still further figuration. The\n                    allegorist
  treats his universe as if its being were literal, as if it\n                    were
  a book. Thus there arises the tradition of “book as\n                    symbol,”
  in which Homer and the Bible hold the first place. Such\n                    works
  are simply large enough to contain a world of words. In them the cult\n                    of
  the One gives way to a cult of the Universe.\n                As distinct from the
  Hellenic, a somewhat less phys-\n                        ical notion of cosmos governs
  the Hebraic-Christian tradition.\n                    Here, from the encyclopedic
  resources of the Old Testament come theories of\n                    the Law as
  the form of the universe. Philo found the Law\n                    “complete and
  true and good,” and in this total system “anything that seemed to be\n                    lacking
  in it was really hidden behind the literalness of the words and it\n                    was
  the task of the student to search it out” (Wolfson, Church Fathers, p. 25). Not
  necessarily the truth or\n                    the goodness of the Torah led to its
  exegetical treatment, but rather\n                    its assumed completeness.
  For Christians this unity carried over into\n                    the fulfillment
  of Old Testament prophecy by events recounted in the New.\n                    The
  structure of the Bible as it finally evolved into the canonical\n                    Books,
  bounded by Genesis and the Apocalypse, implies the cosmic\n                    analogy
  on which its Logos is ordered.\n                Syncretism in ancient Mediterranean
  religious life raised the question of\n                    universal order, while
  the in- fluence of\n                    Alexander also led in this direction. The
  monolithic pretensions of\n                    Augustan Rome may likewise have influenced
  the strongly allegorical cast of Vergi\n                    lian and Ovidian poetry,
  so different from Homer. But it was not\n                    until the Middle Ages
  that the drive toward universal containment and\n                    encirclement
  led to the complete dominance of allegorical methods. From\n                    the
  eleventh century onwards influences from Pseudo- Dionysius, Plato, and Plotinus
  give exegetes a\n                    secure sense of philosophic direction. The
  Timaeus\n                    and theCelestial Hierarchy provide terms and images.
  But in\n                    all areas of life this period shows universalist pre-
  tensions, which Maurice de Wulf characterized simply\n                    as “a
  tendency toward unity.” Political dreams of a\n                    universal brotherhood,
  intellectual dreams of a totally organized body of\n                    knowledge,
  theological dreams of a total theological summa—these were the natural background
  for\n                    allegorical literature. Bernard of Clairvaux finds infinite
  detail in a\n                    closed world, by imagining four infinitely reflexive\n
  \                   “mirrors” of knowl-\n                    edge—the natural, intellectual,
  moral, and historical.\n                    Dante's Commendia, whose form and setting
  rival the\n                    universe, finds a parallel in his De monarchia, a\n
  \                   theory of political unification. By symmetry the actual physi-
  cal universe is converted into a symbol,\n                    and we can speak of
  a “symbolic mentality” which\n                    denied the more immediate puzzles
  presented by the senses. The flight\n                    from the limited toward
  the infinity of the Divine Being kept its balance\n                    only, if
  at all, by asserting that man's world was closed and finite.\n                    Ockham's
  principle of parsimony was invented, it seems, to stem this icon- ographic tide,
  since scholastic\n                    thought, at first ration- alizing, ends by\n
  \                   absorbing the medieval compulsion to turn relations into icons.\n
  \               In a sense allegory thrives even more abundantly during the Renaissance,\n
  \                   because the new cosmology does not at once drive out the old,
  so that\n                    visionary and scientific cosmologies coexist, their
  very difference\n                    enriching the imagery of poets and theologians.
  The main development of the\n                    mode is the gradual rejection of
  the theory of\n                    “levels” of meaning. Most allegorists have in
  fact\n                    used two levels, whatever they may have claimed to do.
  They take a sentence\n                    and give it a double meaning. At its simplest
  this process will be\n                    seen in the parables of Christ. Clement
  of Alexandria, however,\n                    distinguished four levels on which
  he could read a sacred text, a literal\n                    level and three subsidiary
  symbolic stages, the moral, physical, and\n                    theological. Origen
  held that as man is made of body, soul, and\n                    spirit, so interpretation
  must yield three levels of meaning, the literal,\n                    moral, and
  spiritual. Jerome in- voked the\n                    literal, tropological, and
  mystical. Augustine held that all readings of\n                    Scripture, however
  structured, should express charity, yet he too could\n                    speak
  of a hierarchy of levels, for instance, historical,\n                    aetiological,
  analogical, and allegorical (De utilitate\n                        credendi, 3.5).
  What became the classical formulation of Christian047\n                     method,
  the fourfold theory, appeared in Saint John Cassian,\n                    who set
  forth a system of historical (literal), tropological (moral),\n                    allegorical,
  and anagogical. This theory is encapsulated in the mnemonic\n                    distich,
  first cited in 1330, by Augustin de Dacie:\n                        \n                            \n
  \                               Littera gesta docet, quid credas\n                                allegoria,\n
  \                           \n                                Moralia quid agas,
  quo tendas\n                                anagogica.\n                            \n
  \                    The effect of such planar theories of reading is that allegory
  becomes\n                    more mechanical in theory than it can or need ever
  be in practice.\n                What was once available only to the instructed
  interpreter is now the common\n                    property of the experi- encing
  subject. It\n                    is an error, however, to believe that romantic\n
  \                   “symbolism” destroys allegory, although it loosens\n                    and
  reorders the “levels” on which texts are made and\n                    read. Shelley's
  Prometheus Unbound is as much an\n                    allegory as the Psychomachia
  of Prudentius\n                    (348-?410). Where the mode radically declines
  in force is not as a creative\n                    method, but in the interpretive
  divisions of theology, where the new\n                    criticism of the Bible,
  with its scientific research into textual\n                    evolution, raises
  questions about the literary level which are so\n                    searching that
  the dependent symbolic levels pale in theological\n                    importance.\n
  \               \n                        Allegory and Time.\n                     “Rationality
  has nothing to do with dates.”\n                    Thus Lovejoy epitomized the
  static and “absolutely\n                    rigid” form of the Great Chain of Being
  as it had set up the\n                    framework of traditional allegory. The
  stasis of hierarchy is mirrored in\n                    the markedly static character
  of most allegorical fictions, be they\n                    stories, dramas, lyrics,
  or whatever. Allegorical narra- tive yields a fixated image of change, in which\n
  \                   time is synchronic, never diachronic. Augustine imagines human
  destiny\n                    in the shape of a city, following the Book of Revelation.
  Joachim of Floris\n                    diagrams history as an allegorical tree with
  stems and branches. Time\n                    becomes a hypostatized form of becoming.\n
  \               Two aspects of the mode are thus historically prob-\n                        lematic.
  (1) The Hebraic-Christian belief in prophecy asserts\n                    that historical
  figures may prefigure other his-\n                        torical figures, Joshua
  becoming the “type” of\n                    Jesus. Scholars have held that the historicity
  of the figurae radically differentiates them from allegorical\n                    emblems,
  such as the anchor of faith. Yet the typological figure is\n                    under
  constant pressure to revert to a timeless sym-\n                    bol, since typology
  in fact is collapsing the diachronic time-span\n                    and stopping
  the fluent openness of time by envisioning miraculous kairoi, or prophetic moments
  when time\n                    “stands still.” (2) Modern science attacks the\n
  \                   fixation of allegory in yet another quarter, and here perhaps
  there exists\n                    a possibility of a radical change in the allegorical
  method. During and\n                    after the Renais- sance new methods arise\n
  \                   for the analysis and explora\n                    tion of the
  origins of things, along with\n                    their progres- sive development
  away from\n                    those origins. The text of the Bible is one such
  object of study, but the\n                    physical universe and the historical
  world of men are more crucial. In\n                    the Monads of Bruno and Leibniz
  the Great Chain of Being is\n                    “temporalized,” as the closed world
  of Ptolemy, so\n                    useful to the poet's need for a cosmos, gives
  way to an infinite universe.\n                Even more upsetting is the discovery
  of anthro-\n                        pological development. With the Renaissance
  a some- what aesthetic cult of Euhemerus arises, finding\n                    human
  origins for the gods, who are regarded as divinized heroes. Such\n                    beliefs
  lead, along with new historical and archeological knowledge, to new\n                    theories
  of human evolution, beginning with primitive forms and advanc- ing to more complex
  societies. After\n                    Vico it is no longer possible for mythology
  or iconography to divorce\n                    itself from temporal change. First
  the philosophes\n                    of the Enlightenment debunk the allegorizing
  of the gods and daemons,\n                    then the ground shifts under all forms
  of imagination, so that\n                    developmental myths take over from
  the former static world view. The\n                    “new allegor- ism”\n                    tends
  to be more monolithic than the old, permit-\n                        ting a single
  theory of change, whatever it may be, to explain\n                    various possible
  modes of change.\n                \n                        Allegory and Decorum.\n
  \                    While a large view may portend the general undermining of allegory
  in\n                    the modern period, the close-up analysis of allegory makes
  this appear\n                    an unlikely development. Allegories are, as a symbolic
  mode, composed of\n                    ornaments—not, strictly speaking, metaphors.
  Thus, the Greek\n                    term for the larger outlines of a major allegory
  would be kosmos, while in classical Greek the same term does double\n                    duty
  for the rhetorician's “ornament.” The same\n                    double usage appears
  in Latin decus, which grows\n                    into the English terms “decoration”
  and\n                    “decorum.” Allegory expresses the interplay of little\n
  \                   and great worlds, which are ornamentally reflecting surfaces
  of microcosm\n                    and macrocosm.\n                There is no reason
  to suppose that men will cease to decorate themselves or\n                    fail
  to recognize decorum. But modes of ornament continuously change. Con- ceivably the
  present world, with its\n                    increased stand- ardization of artifacts\n
  \                   and its diminishing barriers to travel, will see the speeding-up
  of\n                    allegorical processes. Whether revolutions undermine or
  reorder\n                    cosmologies has become the allegorist's chief problem.
  Allegory can no\n                    longer be what for centuries it had tried to
  be, the image of permanence in\n                    a world of flux. Franz Kafka
  is perhaps the greatest allegorical writer of\n                    modern times,
  and his work revels in cloudy interactions be- tween wierdly undefined characters.
  Yet Kafka\n                    looks at this obscure scene with microscopic delicacy.
  He bases his\n                    fictions largely upon “the Law,” on which,048\n
  \                    following the ancient Jewish tradition, he meditates and builds\n
  \                   a vision of man's destiny as a creature caught up in a closed,
  imprisoning\n                    world.\n                Generally speaking, modern
  allegory shows sings of breaking down many of the\n                    normal divisions
  between things, either by use of dream-mechanisms or by\n                    other
  surrealistic devices. The mode is creatively perhaps most alive\n                    in
  science-fiction, but it permeates the art of advertising, wherever\n                    decoration
  and decorum are the primary commercial interests.\n                    Philosophically
  and theologically there is less place for allegory than\n                    in
  earlier centuries, but one can discern traces of it in the\n                    subjectivism
  of the phenomenologist's concept of transcendence, and in the\n                    actual
  use of fiction by ex- istentialist\n                    authors (for example, the
  novels of Camus, or earlier, the quasi-fictional\n                    treatises
  of Kierkegaard). As in previous times, the allegorist can today\n                    use
  many different media, including music (with\n                    “programs” and
  leitmotifs) and the visual arts (with\n                    emblems and icons).\n

  \               \n             Dictionary of the History of IdeasIn the expansion
  of Western thought allegory has\n                    played a major part from the
  earliest times to the present. Allegories have\n                    taken many forms,
  from mere emblems like the eagle and the dove, to the\n                    simple
  fables of Aesop and parables of Christ, to vast poetic\n                    structures
  like The Divine Comedy and equally large\n                    forms like the patristic
  glosses and commentaries on the Bible. Essentially\n                    a means
  of structuring language so as to produce continuously linked series\n                    of
  double or multiple meanings, this symbols mode depends largely upon\n                    syncretic
  mixtures of symbols from which it builds up “levels of\n                    meaning,”
  sometimes as few as two, or as many as seven.\n                    Minimally it
  holds that no single literal meaning can stand alone, but that\n                    a
  valid utterance must possess a transcendent meaning as well, a\n                    symbolic
  surplus beyond the literal level. Most alle- gories are images of cosmic order,
  and their fixed,\n                    hierarchical, and timeless character becomes
  problem- atic whenever such cosmic orders are subjected to\n                    temporal

  history appears to be its ornamental surface,\n                    which allies
  it with changes in cosmology and decorum and gives it an\n                    exploratory
  as well as a tradi- tional and\n                    conservationist function.\n
  \                       Terminology.\n                     Following classical tradition,
  the sev-\n                        enth-century scholar Isidore of Seville called
  allegory an\n                    inversion of speech, alieni loquium, aliud enim
  sonat,\n                        aliud intelligitur, whereby, in saying one thing\n
  \                    a person conveys or understands something else (\n                        Ety-
  mologiae\n                     I, 47.22). Such deceptively simple formulas, which
  abound in the\n                    history of allegory, suggest, if nothing else,
  the fundamentally oblique\n                    character of this symbolic mode.
  When Saint Augustine speaks of\n                    “a mode of speech in which one
  thing is understood by\n                    another,” his very open definition is
  based on the assumption\n                    that some primary or literal\n                    (ῥητη̂)
  level of sense\n                    may include another secondary or even more remote
  sense, which the trained\n                    interpreter will seek out through
  a process of reflection. Such\n                    secondary meanings may be imposed
  upon a text, or an author may\n                    clearly build them into a text,
  but no clear dis-\n                        tinction separates the interpretive and
  creative aspects of\n                    allegory, since the two are poles in a
  single commu- nicative method. The allegorical poet encodes an\n                    oblique,
  multiple (Dante called it a “polysemous”)\n                    meaning in his fiction,
  using emblems and iconographic devices, for\n                    example, the scythe
  of time, or the apple of discord, and the stories that\n                    go with
  them.The allegorical interpreter decodes this same com-\n                    plex
  message, which assumes that allegory is a struc- tural reality within the text.
  Nevertheless, though\n                        al- legory may exist in a text as
  a\n                    structure, the key to this structure is usually found in
  some system of\n                    values or ideas that lies outside the immediate
  context.\n                    “The allegorical method means the interpretation of
  a text\n                    in terms of something else, irrespective of what that
  something else is.\n                    That something else may be book learning,
  it may be practical wisdom, or it\n                    may be one's inner consciousness.
  All these are matters which depend\n                    upon external circumstances”
  (Wolfson, Philo, I, 134). Allegory thus not only assumes a certain stabil- ity of
  literal meaning, but also the\n                    legitimacy of a movement back
  and forth between that literal meaning\n                    and some external frame
  of reference. In the history of the mode both\n                    creators and
  interpreters have en- joyed wide\n                    freedom in the ways they have
  understood the internal and external\n                    dimensions of their texts,
  and the historian is faced with a bewildering\n                    variety of allegorical
  procedures. Theologians, however, have often\n                    sought to systematize
  the allegorical method.A plethora of traditional technical terms conveys the encyclopedic
  spirit of\n                    this procedure. Hardly an idea in the history of
  Western thought has failed\n                    to find allegorical expression,
  at some period or other. Major\n                    allegorists like Dante and Spenser
  have often summed up the world views of\n                    their time. The term
  “allegory” itself comes from the\n                    teachings of Greco-Roman rhet-
  oricians,\n                    Demetrius, Cicero, Quintilian, and others, who take
  it to mean a series of\n                    linked metaphors, as exemplified in
  Horace's Ode (I,\n                    14), in which the poet elaborates on the “ship
  of\n                    state,” subdividing the single main figure of speech into
  a\n                    series of nautical/politicalDeriving from Greek allos + agoreuein\n
  \                   (“other + speak out”), allegory implies only the most\n                    general
  kind of semantic doubling, and classical rhetoric draws rather\n                    uncertain
  lines between allegory and other fig-\n                    ures of speech, metaphor,
  synecdoche, metonymy, and the like. It\n                    associates allegory
  with notions of design, with terms like paradeigma and schema,\n                    and
  later critics link allegory with figura,\n                    impresa, and emblema,
  which point\n                    to vision, structure, and external form.By contrast
  the older Greek term for allegorical meaning refers us to a\n                    veiling
  function of language.Hyponoia\n                    (ὑπόνοια) was\n                    the
  term which, Plutarch tells us (De audiendis\n                    poetic 4.19), the
  “ancients” had used, and\n                    it implies a hidden meaning, a conjectural
  or suppositious sense, buried\n                        under the literal surface.
  Plato (Republic II. 378d), Euripides (Phoenicians 1131-33), Aristophanes (Frogs\n
  \                   1425-31), Xenophon (Symposium III, 6), all use hyponoia to mean
  what is later subsumed under\n                    allegory (Pépin, pp. 85-86). \n
  \                       Hy- ponoia\n                     furthermore has a noetic
  character; the reader or listener will have\n                    to think his way
  through a se- mantic barrier,\n                    beyond which lies a realm of
  mystic knowledge. Thus Philo Judaeus may\n                    equate the \n                        hy-
  ponoia\n                     of a text with its latent theme, its mystery, its secret,
  its\n                    unexpressed, unseen, nonliteral, or simply intelligible
  meaning. While\n                    theological and other ex- egetes stress the\n
  \                   mysteries of allegory, and classical rhetoric stresses its semantic
  form,\n                    analyzing the shift from hidden to open meaning as a
  semantic\n                    inversion, both exegetes and rhetoricians alike possess
  a large store\n                    of technical synonyms, among them parabole, typos,\n
  \                       fabula, symbolon, ennoia, fictio, figmentum, insinuatio,
  significatio,\n                        similitudo, figura, imago, inter-\n                        pretatio,
  involucrum, integumentum. Some of these\n                    terms define the “external
  circumstances” of allegory\n                    as a theological framework, others
  as philosophy, still others as rhetoric\n                    or poetics. In most
  of the terms obliquity and mystery are the chief\n                    emphasis.
  Augus- tine observes in his De doctrina (2.7-8) that “when\n                    something
  is searched for with difficulty it is, as a result, more\n                    delightfully
  discovered.”If an ascetic interpretive rigor is one main source of pleasure in allegory,\n
  \                   exegetical intricacy is the vice of the mode. From a certain
  angle allegory\n                    is merely a mode of systematic commentary upon
  a text, as opposed to\n                    an unmediated, direct, or literal reading
  of the text, and thus exegesis\n                    must depart from its\n                     source
  in the text. This departure may become ob- sessive. Dante labels his Commedia\n
  \                   “digressive,” while typically the medieval\n                    commentator
  ringed his text with marginalia. The medieval distinction\n                    between
  a gloss and a commentary allowed the latter to stray further\n                    from
  the literal sense. The interpreter often thought of himself as boring\n                    his
  way through a “rind” or\n                    “bark,” so as to allow the hidden symbolic
  truth to\n                    flow outward from the textual center. In the Middle
  Ages at least a text\n                    would be valued in the measure to which
  its lode of inner meaning appeared\n                    to defy exhaustion.\n                        Continuities
  in the History of Allegory.\n                     A literary method which encourages
  the search for multiplicity\n                    of sense is bound to provoke attack
  from rationalist quarters, a situation\n                    we observe with Plato,
  whose rejection of the poets from his ideal republic\n                    includes
  a rejection of the allegorical defense of Homeric myth. Early\n                    Greek
  philosophers, among them Heraclitus and Pythagoras, had found a piety\n                    toward
  god, nature, and man in apparently scandalous passages concerning\n                    the
  gods. Philosophy inverted myth, so that, for example, the jealousy\n                    of
  a god would “truly” represent the physical\n                    activity of a natural
  force. Such a means of saving Homer for morality\n                    proved both
  superficial and irrational in the light of Plato's dialectical\n                    analysis.
  For Plato this allegorical transformation of evil-minded\n                    myths
  did more harm than good, for it permitted the continuance of poetry\n                    in
  preference to the higher pursuit of philosophy. The wisdom saved thereby\n                    was,
  in principle, sophistry. Ironically, Plato himself pro- vided the most substantial
  mechanism and\n                    authority for the persistence of Western allegory.The
  Platonic theory of ideas has two aspects which lead to allegorical\n                    interpretations
  of both signs and things, provided the overarching\n                    authority
  of dialectic is allowed to fade from sight. In the first place\n                    the
  ideas may be taken to constitute the formulas, if not exactly the\n                    forms,
  by which the allegorist's “some-\n                        thing” is interpreted
  as\n                    “something else.” If the snake is an emblem of\n                    jealousy,
  then it is the idea jealousy that\n                    organizes the “coaptation”
  of the snake for this\n                    symbolic purpose. To speak of “the idea
  of a thing”\n                    is almost to invoke the allegorical process, for
  the idea transcends the\n                    thing, much as the allegorist's fiction
  departs from the literal sense of\n                    an utterance. Yet this is
  not the strongest Platonic support for allegory,\n                        pow- erful
  though it is.More important is the Platonic arrangement of the theory of ideas as
  a vast\n                    hierarchical construct, from lower to higher forms.
  By adopting the\n                    “principle of plenitude,” the notion that an\n
  \                   intelligible world would possess all possible forms of all possible\n
  \                   things—as the effluence of the One—Plato answered the allegorist'sThe
  Platonic example may be archetypal for the history of allegory, in that\n                    his
  attack upon Homeric allegorizing is not as general or consistent as at\n                    first
  it seems. He is perhaps open to the charge that he is attacking\n                    any
  allegory which differs in its frame of reference from his own.\n                    Throughout
  the complex de- velopment of\n                    Hebraic-Christian exegesis such
  private invectives are common. The\n                    Christian exegetes attack
  their pagan counterparts, and then proceed to\n                    employ the rejected
  hermeneutic method.At the same time, while rejection and resistance to allegory
  occur\n                    periodically within and between con- tending\n                    schools
  of thought, the method can survive attack largely because its\n                    principle
  of semantic inver- sion enables the\n                    allegorist to shift his
  ground freely whenever an opponent questions him.\n                    Since in
  the theological context of most serious ancient allegory\n                    there
  is scarcely room for a scientific theory of lan-\n                        guage,
  since, in short, language is here a means of revelation,\n                    there
  seems to have been no way for the allegorist to gain perspective on\n                    his
  own activity. By the second century A.D., as a treatise like Plutarch'sOf Isis and
  Osiris will show, a multiplicity of Medi- terranean religions had grown up,\n                    yielding
  an unre- strained exchange of\n                    figures between variant faiths,
  each one providing the materials for\n                    iconography within the
  framework of some other faith.In spite of the intricacy of much exegesis the mode
  generally depends for\n                    its force upon the belief that\n                     words
  have magical power, a belief that is evident in the\n                    influential
  treatises of Pseudo-Dionysius, On the\n                        Celestial Hierarchy
  and On the Divine Names.\n                    Plotinus had already systematized
  the hierarchical aspect of the\n                    Platonic ideas, giving to each
  hypostasis of the One a particular magical\n                    quantum of effluence
  and in- fluence. Within\n                    such frameworks allegory can play a
  double role. In its Neo-Platonic aspect\n                    it looks “up- ward”
  to a\n                    transcendental plane of purer Being, but at the same time
  it retains the\n                    primitivist drive of a language system in which
  every term has its own\n                    share of magical force. By the same
  token most allegorical fictions\n                    are romantic myths, in which
  the characters make full use of magical\n                    weapons, vehicles,
  settings, and quests. The history of allegory is,\n                    strictly
  speaking, not the history of rival theologies and philosophies.\n                    The
  logic of allegory is only remotely rationalistic. Instead, we\n                    observe
  a struggle of magic-thinking to survive within a climate of\n                    ever-increasing
  intellectual and semantic sophistication. This is the more\n                    curious
  in the light of the allegorist's frequent pretense of being logi- cal and rational.
  The pretense covers the\n                    true situation, which is that allegories
  are strict in the manner of\n                    magic rituals, substituting mechanical
  for rational rigor.\n                        Allegorical Syncretism.\n                     The
  creation and inter- pretation\n                    of allegorical texts seems to
  depend on an acceptance of syncretism, the\n                    kind of colloidal
  mixture of religious, philosophical, and cultural beliefs\n                    which
  particularly marks the Hellenistic Age, the second century A.D.,\n                    and
  the High Renaissance, although in the Renaissance syncretism is\n                    strongly
  aesthetic in its combination of elements. Syncretism may be icono- graphically distinguished
  from\n                    synthesis, insofar as the former preserves the individual
  traits of the\n                    combining beliefs, whereas the latter would achieve
  a radical\n                    transformation of disparate cultural forces, until
  a sin- gle set among them came to dominate and control the\n                    assimilation
  of other sets as minor premisses in the logic of the culture\n                    as
  a whole. Syncretism is the cult of diversity within a culture yearning\n                    for
  unified order. It is often to be associated with gnostic\n                    spirituality,
  since the experience of gnosis\n                    includes a transcendence of
  the multiplicity of faiths by entertaining all\n                    their claims
  on an equal footing. Thus Gnosticism finds its sources in\n                    Greek
  Orphism, Pythagoreanism, Mazdean dualism, Jewish apocalyptic,\n                    Egyptian
  mystery- religions,\n                    Hellenistic astrological cult, and various
  kinds of numerology,\n                    “along with the crass 'spirituality' of
  mediums, quacks, and\n                    religious adventurers” (Grant,Roman Hellenism,
  p. 74).The early centuries of Christian expansion spanned a period of syncretism
  in\n                    the Mediterranean world, a fact not without its bearing
  on the development ofA similar, if theologically less complicated syn-\n                        cretism
  surrounds the artist, poet, and scientist during the\n                    Renaissance.
  The “survival of the pagan gods” can\n                    occur then, as during
  the Middle Ages, because while their pagan attributes\n                    are assimilated
  by allegory to moral and mystical frameworks, all of which\n                    are
  guided by Christian principle, their identities as pagan gods are\n                    still
  preserved in ornamental forms within the work of art. This\n                    “neo-paganism,”
  as we may call it, had arisen early\n                    in the West and its legacy
  remains alive even during the Middle Ages,\n                    although only when
  the Renaissance saw a fresh sense of freedom within\n                    the domain
  of vision and imagination could the cult of diversity be\n                    permitted
  to express itself in designs of universal harmony. There is thus\n                    no
  conflict in the fact that Spenser, in The Faerie\n                        Queene,
  bases an important episode and much of the detail of his\n                    Fifth
  Book on “Egyptian” lore, coming from Plutarch,\n                        Of Isis
  and Osiris, and Lucian, De Syria dea, while allegorically the poet ties\n                    these
  materials to the legend of Saint George of England, the Arthurian\n                    Legend,
  fairy lore, and so on, weaving the whole structure with fine\n                    traces
  of Hermetic philosophy, number symbolism, and the cosmology of\n                    Giordano
  Bruno. Such combinations \n                        sus- pend\n                     their
  elements in a sort of mosaic. On the surface such iconographies\n                    are
  richly textured and decorated.Piety may be the chief source of syncretic abun-\n
  \                   dance. The allegorist does not wish to lose any of the materials\n
  \                   present to his mind. This is clear in the case of both Homeric
  and biblical\n                    allegory. A range of motives may contribute to
  such systematic\n                        “accommo-\n                    dation.”
  Piety begins with the mystery of the word\n                    itself, spoken in
  fine verses or written down in magical alphabetic\n                    characters.
  Ancient allegory also displays a reverence for age, naturally\n                    enough,
  since men obeyed inherited social, political, and religious\n                    forms
  of authority. Finally, piety includes the widely held belief\n                    that
  poets, prophets, lawmakers, priests, and philosophers—wise\n                    men,
  in short—enjoyed their wis\n                    dom because they were divinely inspired.
  Inspiration in\n                    particular could account for the jumble of disparate
  pieces that, over\n                    time, found its way into a sacred canon.
  The inspired and mystical meaning\n                    was proved rather than disproved
  by the appearance of arbitrary\n                    inclusion. The more erotic the
  Song of Songs, the better its candidacy for\n                    allegorical interpretation
  as a myth of hierogamy between divine and human\n                    partners. Once
  the alien document is compressed into the overall\n                    vision, its
  message, assumed to be an inspired revela- tion, takes on a transcendental character,
  and\n                    allegory must follow.To piety as the conservative force
  of syncretism may be added its debased\n                    form, superstition.
  A higher mo- tive, which is\n                    harder to define, is the conciliatory
  and accommodating desire to permit a\n                    diverse world of many
  faces and characters. This motive comes into\n                    play when rival
  world views meet in conflict at their bor- ders, when the opposite impulse would,
  as with icono- clasm, seek to destroy the rival\n                    iconography.
  Allegory here becomes a diplomatic medium of thought. Pseudo- Heraclitus, for example,
  tries\n                    to balance different in- terests in his Homeric Problems
  (first century A.D.). He claims\n                    that Homer's Apollo represents
  the sun, in a physical allegory of the\n                    origins of the plague
  in theIliad, while his concern is with cosmogony in readingIliad XVIII, where the
  Shield of Achilles becomes\n                    for him a vast cosmological symbol.
  Yet with these materi- alist readings he aligns others of a different sort,\n                    as
  when he moralizes Athena to mean wisdom, or Hermes to mean\n                    eloquence
  and reason. Finally, his overall syncretism stretches to include\n                    a
  quasi-historical alle- gory, by which the\n                    adultery of Ares
  and Aphrodite represents the mythic origin of\n                    metalworking,
  while the ejection of Hephaistos from heaven stands for\n                    the
  physical discovery that heat can be focussed by mirrors, to create\n                    fire.
  The immediate aim of these varied inter-\n                        pretations is
  the defense of Homer against his moraliz- ing detractors, but beyond this, and perhaps
  more\n                    deeply felt, is the exegete's desire to use Homer as the
  encyclopedic\n                    container for a wide and disparate vari- ety of\n
  \                   intellectual disciplines. Philosophy ceases to be the framework
  for Homer;\n                    Homer becomes the frame- work for philosophy.\n
  \                   Homer has attained the canonical status of a sacred literary
  body.The bolder allegorical syncretisms arise when the elements to be contained\n
  \                   by the allegory are histori- cally\n                    accidental
  inclusions within an inherited literary corpus. The problem is\n                    clearest
  with the Old Testa- ment. Origen, who\n                    believes in the mysterious
  revela- tions of\n                    Scripture, is aware how absurd it is to believe,
  literally, that God\n                    planted a garden like a farmer, or that
  He walked about in the garden. With\n                    the New Testament Origen
  recognized the patently implausibleOrigen is influenced by Philo Judaeus, through
  the intermediary Clement of\n                    Alexandria, and this Alex- andrian\n
  \                   tradition, which would show parallels in the development of
  Hellenistic\n                    allegory, suggests that major allegory requires
  a belief in miracles and\n                        epiphe- nomena, at least on a
  verbal\n                    level. Origen notes that it is “the most wonderful\n
  \                   thing” that spiritual truths could be veiled under\n                    “stories
  of wars and conquerors and the conquered,”\n                    and he notes that
  “the Word of God has arranged for certain\n                    stumbling-blocks,
  as it were, and hindrances and impossibilities to be\n                    inserted
  in the midst of the law and the history.” Such\n                    barriers are
  providential—the more strange they seem, the\n                    more they goad
  the reader to “learn from the Scrip- tures.” Like many allegorists, Origen can\n
  \                   suddenly undercut his own appearance of caprice. He holds that
  the\n                    historically true passages are “far more numerous than
  those\n                    which are composed with purely spiritual meanings.” Yet
  whenever\n                    a historical scandal appears, he can, if he chooses,
  fall back on a\n                    spiritual inter- pretation. For this\n                    reason
  his method has appeared to one of his close students\n                    “unchartably
  subjective.... Whatever Origen's theory of allegory\n                    may have
  been, it is quite inaccurate to call his application of its sys- tematic” (Hanson,
  p. 245). Now,\n                    if allegory is expected to have what Hanson calls\n
  \                   “rules,” it seems clear that Origen and all other\n                    major
  allegorists are “unchartably subjective.” But\n                    then, so is syncretism
  in general, and for that reason, in describing his\n                    own work,
  Dante used his term “polysemous,” or\n                    ambiguous.Yet another
  approach will demand both more and less from allegorical\n                    syncretism
  and will perhaps justify its endless prolixity. This approach is\n                    to
  be found in the Origenist and Philonic belief in the mystery of the\n                    Word.
  Prophecy assumes that the prophet not only sees the vision of the\n                    truth,
  but can “speak out” for this vision, sharing\n                    in the divine
  Logos. Philo may alle- gorize\n                    any portion of the Old Testament,
  any single image or word, any story, any\n                    disparity or contra\n
  \                   dictory episode. But he does not do this in a spirit of negative\n
  \                   or defensive reaction, but rather as the ex-\n                        pression
  of an intellectual or speculative freedom. This mode\n                    employs
  philosophic methods, but Philo is per-\n                    haps less a philosopher
  than a prophet of philosophy. Thus he may go\n                    beyond the Platonic
  use of the Ideas as the forms, or paradigms, of things\n                    in the
  universe, and can hold that the Logos is everywhere immanent in\n                    the
  cosmos—“the totality of the powers of God\n                    existing within the
  cosmos itself” (Wolfson, Philo, p. 327). This Logos, unlike the Stoics' material
  logos,\n                    is immaterial, and on that basis can lead to allegories
  judged\n                    “unchartably subjective” from the perspective of\n                    natural
  and human history. Phrased differently, the Philonic use of an\n                    immanent
  logos directs hermeneutic towards mystery, which is buried within\n                    the
  Word, whereas the Stoic logos directs it away from mystery towards\n                    reason.
  Yet Philo and the allegorical tradition stemming from him may not\n                    be
  identified with the via negativa of the\n                    mystics, since rather
  than draw his cosmological interpretations into such\n                    a spiritualism
  of the Logos that they reach evanescence, in a cloud of\n                    unknowing,
  he draws them toward an infinitely ramified, but consistently\n                    word-centered
  universe of discourse. What saves his allegory from\n                    irrationality
  is its recognition that “rationality, when\n                    conceived as complete,
  as excluding all arbitrariness, becomes itself\n                    a kind of irrationality”
  (Lovejoy, Great Chain of\n                        Being, p. 331). Philo is continuously
  interested in the\n                    verbal, linguistic aspect of the Word. He
  shares the almost immemorial\n                    use of exegetical etymologizing,
  which is finally canonized in the\n                    encyclopedic Etymologiae
  of Saint Isidore. If we\n                    broaden the Philonic approach to include
  images and figures of speech as\n                    well as the literal or referential
  materials of language, we may speak\n                    of the “logology” of poets
  and artists as well as of\n                    theologians and philosophers (Burke,
  Rhetoric of\n                    Religion).The underlying wisdom of the Philonic
  strain of allegory is its stress on\n                    the freedom of the interpreting
  mind, on what a seventeenth-century divine\n                    called “the liberty
  of prophesying.” Its vice is\n                    ingenuity, but its virtue is the
  corresponding one of a compulsion to\n                    investigate and comment
  upon the Word and its prog-\n                    eny, words. The noblest document
  composed with such allegory in mind\n                    is the Fourth Gospel. Common
  to all such Logos-centered allegories is the\n                    belief that words
  contain wisdom, and the form in which we inherit\n                    words from
  the past is itself not without reason, if we can only discover\n                    the
  inner web of motives that led to the slow formation of that legacy. It\n                    is
  often said that allegory, outside the specifically historical mode\n                    known
  as typology, is antihistorical. When morality and ethics are the\n                    reference-point,
  this is true enough.\n                        Allegory and the Cosmos.\n                     The
  history of allegory is tuned to the history of cosmological\n                    speculation,
  so much so that allegory might be defined as figurative\n                    cosmology.
  Each such fiction presents the image of a universe (and this is\n                    true
  even of short works), or implies that its details fit into a cosmic\n                    picture.
  Yet this imagery is not identical with the scientist's use of\n                    theoretical
  models. The allegorist does not prove and disprove hypotheses\n                    which
  are then dropped if they fail to hold up as fact. Allegory does not\n                    move
  toward the certainty of fact; it moves toward tenacity of belief.\n                    Analogy
  serves the allegorist, as it serves the cosmolo- gist, but here the test of the
  figurative schema is not its yield of experiment or\n                    observation,
  but its fertility in leading to still further figuration. The\n                    allegorist
  treats his universe as if its being were literal, as if it\n                    were
  a book. Thus there arises the tradition of “book as\n                    symbol,”
  in which Homer and the Bible hold the first place. Such\n                    works
  are simply large enough to contain a world of words. In them the cult\n                    of
  the One gives way to a cult of the Universe.As distinct from the Hellenic, a somewhat
  less phys-\n                        ical notion of cosmos governs the Hebraic-Christian
  tradition.\n                    Here, from the encyclopedic resources of the Old
  Testament come theories of\n                    the Law as the form of the universe.
  Philo found the Law\n                    “complete and true and good,” and in this
  total system “anything that seemed to be\n                    lacking in it was
  really hidden behind the literalness of the words and it\n                    was
  the task of the student to search it out” (Wolfson, Church Fathers, p. 25). Not
  necessarily the truth or\n                    the goodness of the Torah led to its
  exegetical treatment, but rather\n                    its assumed completeness.
  For Christians this unity carried over into\n                    the fulfillment
  of Old Testament prophecy by events recounted in the New.\n                    The
  structure of the Bible as it finally evolved into the canonical\n                    Books,
  bounded by Genesis and the Apocalypse, implies the cosmic\n                    analogy
  on which its Logos is ordered.Syncretism in ancient Mediterranean religious life
  raised the question of\n                    universal order, while the in- fluence
  of\n                    Alexander also led in this direction. The monolithic pretensions
  of\n                    Augustan Rome may likewise have influenced the strongly
  allegorical cast of Vergi\n                    lian and Ovidian poetry, so different
  from Homer. But it was not\n                    until the Middle Ages that the drive
  toward universal containment and\n                    encirclement led to the complete
  dominance of allegorical methods. From\n                    the eleventh century
  onwards influences from Pseudo- Dionysius, Plato, and Plotinus give exegetes a\n
  \                   secure sense of philosophic direction. The Timaeus\n                    and
  theCelestial Hierarchy provide terms and images. But in\n                    all
  areas of life this period shows universalist pre- tensions, which Maurice de Wulf
  characterized simply\n                    as “a tendency toward unity.” Political
  dreams of a\n                    universal brotherhood, intellectual dreams of a
  totally organized body of\n                    knowledge, theological dreams of
  a total theological summa—these were the natural background for\n                    allegorical
  literature. Bernard of Clairvaux finds infinite detail in a\n                    closed
  world, by imagining four infinitely reflexive\n                    “mirrors” of
  knowl-\n                    edge—the natural, intellectual, moral, and historical.\n
  \                   Dante's Commendia, whose form and setting rival the\n                    universe,
  finds a parallel in his De monarchia, a\n                    theory of political
  unification. By symmetry the actual physi- cal universe is converted into a symbol,\n
  \                   and we can speak of a “symbolic mentality” which\n                    denied
  the more immediate puzzles presented by the senses. The flight\n                    from
  the limited toward the infinity of the Divine Being kept its balance\n                    only,
  if at all, by asserting that man's world was closed and finite.\n                    Ockham's
  principle of parsimony was invented, it seems, to stem this icon- ographic tide,
  since scholastic\n                    thought, at first ration- alizing, ends by\n
  \                   absorbing the medieval compulsion to turn relations into icons.In
  a sense allegory thrives even more abundantly during the Renaissance,\n                    because
  the new cosmology does not at once drive out the old, so that\n                    visionary
  and scientific cosmologies coexist, their very difference\n                    enriching
  the imagery of poets and theologians. The main development of the\n                    mode
  is the gradual rejection of the theory of\n                    “levels” of meaning.
  Most allegorists have in fact\n                    used two levels, whatever they
  may have claimed to do. They take a sentence\n                    and give it a
  double meaning. At its simplest this process will be\n                    seen in
  the parables of Christ. Clement of Alexandria, however,\n                    distinguished
  four levels on which he could read a sacred text, a literal\n                    level
  and three subsidiary symbolic stages, the moral, physical, and\n                    theological.
  Origen held that as man is made of body, soul, and\n                    spirit,
  so interpretation must yield three levels of meaning, the literal,\n                    moral,
  and spiritual. Jerome in- voked the\n                    literal, tropological,
  and mystical. Augustine held that all readings of\n                    Scripture,
  however structured, should express charity, yet he too could\n                    speak
  of a hierarchy of levels, for instance, historical,\n                    aetiological,
  analogical, and allegorical (De utilitate\n                        credendi, 3.5).
  What became the classical formulation of ChristianWhat was once available only to
  the instructed interpreter is now the common\n                    property of the
  experi- encing subject. It\n                    is an error, however, to believe
  that romantic\n                    “symbolism” destroys allegory, although it loosens\n
  \                   and reorders the “levels” on which texts are made and\n                    read.
  Shelley's Prometheus Unbound is as much an\n                    allegory as the
  Psychomachia of Prudentius\n                    (348-?410). Where the mode radically
  declines in force is not as a creative\n                    method, but in the interpretive
  divisions of theology, where the new\n                    criticism of the Bible,
  with its scientific research into textual\n                    evolution, raises
  questions about the literary level which are so\n                    searching that
  the dependent symbolic levels pale in theological\n                    importance.\n
  \                       Allegory and Time.\n                     “Rationality has
  nothing to do with dates.”\n                    Thus Lovejoy epitomized the static
  and “absolutely\n                    rigid” form of the Great Chain of Being as
  it had set up the\n                    framework of traditional allegory. The stasis
  of hierarchy is mirrored in\n                    the markedly static character of
  most allegorical fictions, be they\n                    stories, dramas, lyrics,
  or whatever. Allegorical narra- tive yields a fixated image of change, in which\n
  \                   time is synchronic, never diachronic. Augustine imagines human
  destiny\n                    in the shape of a city, following the Book of Revelation.
  Joachim of Floris\n                    diagrams history as an allegorical tree with
  stems and branches. Time\n                    becomes a hypostatized form of becoming.Two
  aspects of the mode are thus historically prob-\n                        lematic.
  (1) The Hebraic-Christian belief in prophecy asserts\n                    that historical
  figures may prefigure other his-\n                        torical figures, Joshua
  becoming the “type” of\n                    Jesus. Scholars have held that the historicity
  of the figurae radically differentiates them from allegorical\n                    emblems,
  such as the anchor of faith. Yet the typological figure is\n                    under
  constant pressure to revert to a timeless sym-\n                    bol, since typology
  in fact is collapsing the diachronic time-span\n                    and stopping
  the fluent openness of time by envisioning miraculous kairoi, or prophetic moments
  when time\n                    “stands still.” (2) Modern science attacks the\n
  \                   fixation of allegory in yet another quarter, and here perhaps
  there exists\n                    a possibility of a radical change in the allegorical
  method. During and\n                    after the Renais- sance new methods arise\n
  \                   for the analysis and explora\n                    tion of the
  origins of things, along with\n                    their progres- sive development
  away from\n                    those origins. The text of the Bible is one such
  object of study, but the\n                    physical universe and the historical
  world of men are more crucial. In\n                    the Monads of Bruno and Leibniz
  the Great Chain of Being is\n                    “temporalized,” as the closed world
  of Ptolemy, so\n                    useful to the poet's need for a cosmos, gives
  way to an infinite universe.Even more upsetting is the discovery of anthro-\n                        pological
  development. With the Renaissance a some- what aesthetic cult of Euhemerus arises,
  finding\n                    human origins for the gods, who are regarded as divinized
  heroes. Such\n                    beliefs lead, along with new historical and archeological
  knowledge, to new\n                    theories of human evolution, beginning with
  primitive forms and advanc- ing to more complex societies. After\n                    Vico
  it is no longer possible for mythology or iconography to divorce\n                    itself
  from temporal change. First the philosophes\n                    of the Enlightenment
  debunk the allegorizing of the gods and daemons,\n                    then the ground
  shifts under all forms of imagination, so that\n                    developmental
  myths take over from the former static world view. The\n                    “new
  allegor- ism”\n                    tends to be more monolithic than the old, permit-\n
  \                       ting a single theory of change, whatever it may be, to explain\n
  \                   various possible modes of change.\n                        Allegory
  and Decorum.\n                     While a large view may portend the general undermining
  of allegory in\n                    the modern period, the close-up analysis of
  allegory makes this appear\n                    an unlikely development. Allegories
  are, as a symbolic mode, composed of\n                    ornaments—not, strictly
  speaking, metaphors. Thus, the Greek\n                    term for the larger outlines
  of a major allegory would be kosmos, while in classical Greek the same term does
  double\n                    duty for the rhetorician's “ornament.” The same\n                    double
  usage appears in Latin decus, which grows\n                    into the English
  terms “decoration” and\n                    “decorum.” Allegory expresses the interplay
  of little\n                    and great worlds, which are ornamentally reflecting
  surfaces of microcosm\n                    and macrocosm.There is no reason to suppose
  that men will cease to decorate themselves or\n                    fail to recognize
  decorum. But modes of ornament continuously change. Con- ceivably the present world,
  with its\n                    increased stand- ardization of artifacts\n                    and
  its diminishing barriers to travel, will see the speeding-up of\n                    allegorical
  processes. Whether revolutions undermine or reorder\n                    cosmologies
  has become the allegorist's chief problem. Allegory can no\n                    longer
  be what for centuries it had tried to be, the image of permanence in\n                    a
  world of flux. Franz Kafka is perhaps the greatest allegorical writer of\n                    modern
  times, and his work revels in cloudy interactions be- tween wierdly undefined characters.
  Yet Kafka\n                    looks at this obscure scene with microscopic delicacy.
  He bases his\n                    fictions largely upon “the Law,” on which,Generally
  speaking, modern allegory shows sings of breaking down many of the\n                    normal
  divisions between things, either by use of dream-mechanisms or by\n                    other
  surrealistic devices. The mode is creatively perhaps most alive\n                    in
  science-fiction, but it permeates the art of advertising, wherever\n                    decoration
  and decorum are the primary commercial interests.\n                    Philosophically
  and theologically there is less place for allegory than\n                    in
  earlier centuries, but one can discern traces of it in the\n                    subjectivism
  of the phenomenologist's concept of transcendence, and in the\n                    actual
  use of fiction by ex- istentialist\n                    authors (for example, the
  novels of Camus, or earlier, the quasi-fictional\n                    treatises
  of Kierkegaard). As in previous times, the allegorist can today\n                    use
  many different media, including music (with\n                    “programs” and
  leitmotifs) and the visual arts (with\n                    emblems and icons).General
