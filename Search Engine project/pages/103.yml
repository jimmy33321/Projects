- "Chapter 23. Deliberate bias: Conflict creates bad science\r\n"
- "When proper scientific procedure is undermined by conflicting\r\n"
- "goals so that it results in deception, we say it is biased. This form\r\n"
- "of bias is prevalent in advertising - companies universally advocate\r\n"
- "their products, emphasizing product assets while concealing product\r\n"
- "faults and concealing the advantages of competitor products. You\r\n"
- "don't expect an advertisement from a private company to offer a fair\r\n"
- "appraisal of the commodity. But bias even exists in the way that\r\n"
- "states promote their lotteries by advertising the number of winners\r\n"
- "and money \"given away\" without telling you the number of\r\n"
- "losers and money taken in.\r\n"
- "Deliberate bias occurs in science as well as in business and\r\n"
- "politics. The potential for bias arises when a scientist has some\r\n"
- "goal other than (or in addition to) finding an accurate model of\r\n"
- "nature, such as increasing profits, furthering a political cause, or\r\n"
- "protecting funding. As an example, the environmental consulting firm\r\n"
- "that renders an opinion about the environmental effects of the latest\r\n"
- "subdivision may not give a completely accurate assessment. The future\r\n"
- "work that this firm receives from developers is likely to depend on\r\n"
- "what they say. If the developers don't like the assessment, they will\r\n"
- "likely find another environmental next time. Thus there is a conflict\r\n"
- "between obtaining an unbiased model, and making the largest profit\r\n"
- "possible. In these cases, the scientists are motivated to present\r\n"
- "biased arguments. There are many situations which present a conflict\r\n"
- "between scientific objectivity and some other goal. \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "Drugs and medicine\r\n"
- "We take for granted an unlimited supply of medicinal drugs. If we\r\n"
- "get pneumonia, gonorrhea, HIV, or cancer, the drugs of choice are\r\n"
- "invariably available. They may not cure us, but whatever drugs we\r\n"
- "know about (that have been approved) are in abundant supply. \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "For the most part, this abundance of and reliance on drugs comes\r\n"
- "from public trust of health care. We don't imagine that our doctors\r\n"
- "try to prescribe us useless or unnecessary drugs (if anything, the\r\n"
- "patient often requests drugs when they are unnecessary). But in\r\n"
- "reality, many drugs ARE unnecessary, and some drugs are no better\r\n"
- "than cheaper alternatives. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is\r\n"
- "charged with approving new foods and drugs for the U.S. In 1992, it\r\n"
- "was approving about 20 new drugs a year but regarded only about 20%\r\n"
- "of those as true advances. So many drugs are no better than\r\n"
- "alternatives (many are obviously at least slightly worse than\r\n"
- "alternatives). And physicians often don't have the evidence to know\r\n"
- "which drugs are best. \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "The goals of consumers are in conflict with those of drug\r\n"
- "companies in some respects. \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "The consumer wants drugs that\r\n"
- "are\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "cost-effective \r\n"
- "safe \r\n"
- "with few side-effects. \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "If two drugs are equally effective, we want the cheaper one. We may\r\n"
- "even not want the most effective drug if a cheaper one will do the\r\n"
- "trick. \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "But the goals of any drug company\r\n"
- "are different:\r\n"
- "company profits,\r\n"
- "which may involve\r\n"
- "company reputation \r\n"
- " a successful treatment but not necessarily a cure \r\n"
- "low risk of liability claims (which may include drug safety and low\r\n"
- "side-effect) \r\n"
- "It costs to hundreds of millions of dollars to get a drug approved\r\n"
- "by the FDA now. Much of the cost is in research and trials, but even\r\n"
- "FDA consideration itself costs millions. So it is not cheap. Most\r\n"
- "important is time, because the sooner a drug hits the market, the\r\n"
- "sooner the company reaps the benefits. So drug companies have strong\r\n"
- "incentives to market any product that is approved by the FDA -- once\r\n"
- "approved, the major costs of money (and time) have already been\r\n"
- "borne. \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "Of course, it does not behoove a company to market a harmful\r\n"
- "product -- liability costs can be quite high. But most products that\r\n"
- "pass all the hurdles of FDA approval can be regarded as harmless at\r\n"
- "worst. The drug company has a very strong incentive to market its\r\n"
- "approved products regardless of whether the consumer benefits or not.\r\n"
- "One of the most economically successful drugs ever was an ulcer\r\n"
- "medicine that reduced suffering. It did not cure ulcers but instead\r\n"
- "had to be taken as long as the patient had the ulcer. Research later\r\n"
- "found that most ulcers were caused by a bacterium and that treatment\r\n"
- "with antibiotics cured the ulcer. So the original ulcer treatment was\r\n"
- "based on a misunderstanding of the cause of ulcers. \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "The drug industry is a relatively new one. Yet is it also a huge\r\n"
- "one economically. Perhaps as a consequence of this high-dollar label,\r\n"
- "its practices have come under scrutiny in the last decade or so. In\r\n"
- "spite of the public trust of health care in this country, many\r\n"
- "practices of the drug industry are not in the best interest of the\r\n"
- "patient. They instead seemed to be directed at promoting and selling\r\n"
- "products, and for a prescription drug, the key player in drug sales\r\n"
- "is the physician. Drug companies have thus made huge efforts to\r\n"
- "influence physicians toward selling company products. Some of the\r\n"
- "major (legal) practices that have been uncovered include: \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "1) Drug companies have paid for\r\n"
- "university research on their products and have then blocked\r\n"
- "publication of unfavorable results and/or cut continued funding of\r\n"
- "the work when the results began to look bad. \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "2) Pharmacy sales people routinely visit\r\n"
- "physicians at work, offering them free lunches, free samples of\r\n"
- "medicines, gifts, information to promote their products, and notepads\r\n"
- "and pens with company logos. (Next time you visit a physician, look\r\n"
- "around the inner rooms for evidence of company logos on charts, pens,\r\n"
- "pads, and so on.) \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "3) To maintain their licenses, physicians\r\n"
- "are required to take courses in continuing medical education (CME).\r\n"
- "These courses are often sponsored and paid for by drug companies in\r\n"
- "exotic locations and with hand-picked speakers who provide favorable\r\n"
- "coverage of company products. \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "4) Drug companies publish ads in medical\r\n"
- "journals that look and read like research articles. These ads promote\r\n"
- "products. \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "These practices are not in the interest of good medicine, unless\r\n"
- "one assumes that what is good for the drug company is good for us. \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "DNA\r\n"
- "A second, well-documented case in which conflict is manifested is\r\n"
- "over DNA typing. These examples may not reflect current debate over\r\n"
- "DNA technology, but one should use them to appreciate the strong\r\n"
- "potential for conflict over any scientific issue in the legal system.\r\n"
- "The rush to implement DNA typing in the U.S. criminal system was\r\n"
- "done before guidelines were set for proper DNA typing procedures.\r\n"
- "Consequently, there were varying levels of uncertainty in the use of\r\n"
- "these methods by law enforcement agencies and commercial labs. They\r\n"
- "were also reluctant to admit the uncertainty. The manifestation of\r\n"
- "conflict over DNA evidence was thus  heated and  surfaced in the\r\n"
- "popular press on several occasions. We introduce this material in a\r\n"
- "prospective manner - by first imagining how the prosecution, defense,\r\n"
- "and forensic lab can be expected to behave to achieve their goals in\r\n"
- "ways that are contrary to fair scientific procedure. You have already\r\n"
- "been exposed to the nature of the models and data in DNA typing, so\r\n"
- "now the issue is how the different legal parties deal with the\r\n"
- "problems in evaluation and ideal data.\r\n"
- "If a case that uses DNA typing has come to trial, we can assume\r\n"
- "that the DNA results support the prosecution's case.  There are thus\r\n"
- "three parties in conflict:\r\n"
- "Prosecution    <<< (in\r\n"
- "conflict with) >>>   Defense   <<< (in\r\n"
- "conflict with) >>>   DNA lab\r\n"
- "We can assume that the DNA lab's\r\n"
- "results support the Prosecution's case, or there would not be a\r\n"
- "trial, so the conflict will lie between the Defense and the other two\r\n"
- "agencies.  Now consider how this conflict might be manifested.\r\n"
- "I) What might the prosecution do to\r\n"
- "improve the chances of reaching its goals? \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "1) eliminate test procedures that\r\n"
- "\t\tbenefit the suspect (eliminate standards; build a case of\r\n"
- "\t\tcircumstantial evidence to shield criticism of the DNA fingerprint\r\n"
- "\t\tevidence). \r\n"
- "\t\t\r\n"
- "\t\t2) harass or impede prior\r\n"
- "\t\twitnesses for the defense who might testify in the future. \r\n"
- "\t\t\r\n"
- "\t\t3) keep a list of sympathetic\r\n"
- "\t\texpert witnesses \r\n"
- "\t\t\r\n"
- "\t\t4) Maintain positive relationships with labs that have\r\n"
- "\t\tcontributed to convictions in the past. \r\n"
- "\t\t\r\n"
- "\tII) With respect to the errors and\r\n"
- "uncertainties of DNA evidence in specific cases: \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "5) argue that inconsistencies are\r\n"
- "\t\tplausible artifacts \r\n"
- "\t\t\r\n"
- "\t\t6) fail to question any outcome in its favor \r\n"
- "\t\t\r\n"
- "\tIII) How is the defense likely to behave? \r\n"
- "\t\r\n"
- "1) keep a list of sympathetic\r\n"
- "\t\texpert witnesses \r\n"
- "\t\t\r\n"
- "\t\t2) emphasize all inconsistencies\r\n"
- "\t\tin the DNA analyses as evidence of innocence \r\n"
- "\t\t\r\n"
- "\t\t3) question all assumptions, original data, calculations \r\n"
- "\t\t\r\n"
- "\tIV) How is the lab likely to behave? \r\n"
- "\t\r\n"
- "1) Produce results that enhance\r\n"
- "\t\tthe goals of their economic benefactor, including \r\n"
- "\t\t\r\n"
- "\t\t2) establish a reputation for a\r\n"
- "\t\tlack of indecisiveness; overstate case \r\n"
- "\t\t\r\n"
- "\t\t3) defend its initial conclusions \r\n"
- "\t\t\r\n"
- "\tEvidence from DNA cases\r\n"
- "The case histories available from the last 4-5 years of DNA\r\n"
- "forensics verify many of these expectations. In particular, DNA\r\n"
- "testing has omitted such basic elements as standards and blind\r\n"
- "procedures (I.1 above); the prosecution in the Castro case ignored\r\n"
- "inconsistencies in the evidence (I.5, I.6); the lab in the Castro\r\n"
- "case overstated the significance of a match and defended such\r\n"
- "practices as failing to include a male control for the male-specific\r\n"
- "probe (III.2, III.3). Defense and prosecution agencies definitely\r\n"
- "keep lists of sympathetic witnesses (I.3, II.1), and defense agencies\r\n"
- "indeed choose witnesses to challenge the nature of DNA evidence based\r\n"
- "on its (necessarily false) assumptions (II.3). And finally,\r\n"
- "harassment by the prosecution of experts who testify for the defense\r\n"
- "is well documented, both in the courtroom and outside (I.2). This\r\n"
- "harassment includes character assassination on the witness stand,\r\n"
- "implied threats to personal liberties for witnesses who were in the\r\n"
- "U.S. on visas, and contacts made to journal editors to prevent\r\n"
- "publication of papers submitted by the witness. Some of these cases\r\n"
- "have been described in the popular press, and others are known to us\r\n"
- "through contacts with our colleagues. These latter manifestations of\r\n"
- "conflict don't make sense in the context of a single trial, but they\r\n"
- "stem from the fact that networks exist in which prosecuting attorneys\r\n"
- "share information and parallel networks exist among defense\r\n"
- "attorneys.  Expert witnesses are often used in multiple trials across\r\n"
- "the country, so any expert witness who is discouraged at the end of\r\n"
- "one trial will be less likely to participate in future trials, and\r\n"
- "conversely, an expert who does well in a trial may be more likely to\r\n"
- "participate in future trials.  \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "The suggestions of harassment have even extended to scientists who\r\n"
- "merely publish criticisms of forensic applications of DNA typing. In\r\n"
- "the 1991-92 Christmas break, two papers were published in Science on\r\n"
- "opposites of the DNA fingerprinting conflict (Science 254: 1745-50,\r\n"
- "and 1735-39). At the same time, news items were also published in\r\n"
- "Science, Nature, The New York Times, and The Washington Post, in\r\n"
- "which the details of this conflict were aired in full detail. The\r\n"
- "authors of the paper opposing use of current DNA typing methods\r\n"
- "(Lewontin & Hartl) were phoned by a Justice Department official\r\n"
- "and allegedly threatened with retaliation (having their federal\r\n"
- "funding jeopardized); the official denied the threats but did not\r\n"
- "deny the phone call. The Lewontin-Hartl article had apparently been\r\n"
- "leaked in advance of publication, and an editor for Science contacted\r\n"
- "the head editor to have a rebuttal published. However, it turned out\r\n"
- "that the editor requesting the rebuttal owns a patent for DNA\r\n"
- "fingerprinting and stands to benefit financially by forensic use of\r\n"
- "DNA typing methods. The two authors chosen for the rebuttal had been\r\n"
- "funded by the FBI to work on DNA fingerprinting methods. So, there\r\n"
- "appears to have been some serious conflicts of interest at least on\r\n"
- "one side of the issue.\r\n"
- "This treatment of conflict in DNA trials has omitted a 4th\r\n"
- "category of people whose goals may conflict with the agencies above: \r\n"
- "the expert witnesses themselves.  The goals of expert witnesses may\r\n"
- "be varied, including monetary (the standard rate is $1000/day in\r\n"
- "court), notoriety, and philosophical (e.g., some people volunteer to\r\n"
- "assist the defense on a no-cost basis, merely to ensure a fair\r\n"
- "trial).  \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "EMFs\r\n"
- "The last specific example to be discussed concerns some old\r\n"
- "examples of conflict between power companies and population exposure\r\n"
- "to high-intensity EMFs. The primary conflict has been between the\r\n"
- "people exposed to EMFs (e.g. those living under high-voltage power\r\n"
- "lines) and corporations or government agencies responsible for\r\n"
- "various aspects of electric power. In a series of three articles in\r\n"
- "The New Yorker (12, 19, and 26 June, 1989), Paul Brodeur\r\n"
- "described in a somewhat sensationalist manner how various agencies\r\n"

- "to obscure and suppress evidence contrary to their views, along with\r\n"
- "the suspicious ill fates that befell the careers of scientists who\r\n"
- "testified in opposition to these organizations. For example, the Navy\r\n"
- "\"classified\" a report of such evidences to prevent its\r\n"
- "dissemination. The New York Power Company attempted to discredit\r\n"

- "criticizing its own investigation of this matter. Fortunately, the\r\n"
- "suppression of possible harmful effects of EMFs happears to have\r\n"
- "subsided, and power companies have even recently funded research into\r\n"
- "the problem.\r\n"
- "The footprints of bias: Generalities\r\n"
- "The attempt to deceive in science may take many specific forms. At\r\n"
- "a general level, arguments may avoid the scientific method entirely,\r\n"

  the null model enjoys a protected status, and it is to anyone's advantage to choose

  science\r\nWhen proper scientific procedure is undermined by conflicting\r\ngoals
  so that it results in deception, we say it is biased. This form\r\nof bias is prevalent
  in advertising - companies universally advocate\r\ntheir products, emphasizing product
  assets while concealing product\r\nfaults and concealing the advantages of competitor
  products. You\r\ndon't expect an advertisement from a private company to offer a
  fair\r\nappraisal of the commodity. But bias even exists in the way that\r\nstates
  promote their lotteries by advertising the number of winners\r\nand money \"given
  away\" without telling you the number of\r\nlosers and money taken in.\r\nDeliberate
  bias occurs in science as well as in business and\r\npolitics. The potential for
  bias arises when a scientist has some\r\ngoal other than (or in addition to) finding
  an accurate model of\r\nnature, such as increasing profits, furthering a political
  cause, or\r\nprotecting funding. As an example, the environmental consulting firm\r\nthat
  renders an opinion about the environmental effects of the latest\r\nsubdivision
  may not give a completely accurate assessment. The future\r\nwork that this firm
  receives from developers is likely to depend on\r\nwhat they say. If the developers
  don't like the assessment, they will\r\nlikely find another environmental next time.
  Thus there is a conflict\r\nbetween obtaining an unbiased model, and making the
  largest profit\r\npossible. In these cases, the scientists are motivated to present\r\nbiased
  arguments. There are many situations which present a conflict\r\nbetween scientific
  objectivity and some other goal. \r\n\r\nDrugs and medicine\r\nWe take for granted
  an unlimited supply of medicinal drugs. If we\r\nget pneumonia, gonorrhea, HIV,
  or cancer, the drugs of choice are\r\ninvariably available. They may not cure us,
  but whatever drugs we\r\nknow about (that have been approved) are in abundant supply.
  \r\n\r\nFor the most part, this abundance of and reliance on drugs comes\r\nfrom
  public trust of health care. We don't imagine that our doctors\r\ntry to prescribe
  us useless or unnecessary drugs (if anything, the\r\npatient often requests drugs
  when they are unnecessary). But in\r\nreality, many drugs ARE unnecessary, and some
  drugs are no better\r\nthan cheaper alternatives. The Food and Drug Administration
  (FDA) is\r\ncharged with approving new foods and drugs for the U.S. In 1992, it\r\nwas
  approving about 20 new drugs a year but regarded only about 20%\r\nof those as true
  advances. So many drugs are no better than\r\nalternatives (many are obviously at
  least slightly worse than\r\nalternatives). And physicians often don't have the
  evidence to know\r\nwhich drugs are best. \r\n\r\nThe goals of consumers are in
  conflict with those of drug\r\ncompanies in some respects. \r\n\r\nThe consumer
  wants drugs that\r\nare\r\n\r\ncost-effective \r\nsafe \r\nwith few side-effects.
  \r\n\r\nIf two drugs are equally effective, we want the cheaper one. We may\r\neven
  not want the most effective drug if a cheaper one will do the\r\ntrick. \r\n\r\nBut
  the goals of any drug company\r\nare different:\r\ncompany profits,\r\nwhich may
  involve\r\ncompany reputation \r\n a successful treatment but not necessarily a
  cure \r\nlow risk of liability claims (which may include drug safety and low\r\nside-effect)
  \r\nIt costs to hundreds of millions of dollars to get a drug approved\r\nby the
  FDA now. Much of the cost is in research and trials, but even\r\nFDA consideration
  itself costs millions. So it is not cheap. Most\r\nimportant is time, because the
  sooner a drug hits the market, the\r\nsooner the company reaps the benefits. So
  drug companies have strong\r\nincentives to market any product that is approved
  by the FDA -- once\r\napproved, the major costs of money (and time) have already
  been\r\nborne. \r\n\r\nOf course, it does not behoove a company to market a harmful\r\nproduct
  -- liability costs can be quite high. But most products that\r\npass all the hurdles
  of FDA approval can be regarded as harmless at\r\nworst. The drug company has a
  very strong incentive to market its\r\napproved products regardless of whether the
  consumer benefits or not.\r\nOne of the most economically successful drugs ever
  was an ulcer\r\nmedicine that reduced suffering. It did not cure ulcers but instead\r\nhad
  to be taken as long as the patient had the ulcer. Research later\r\nfound that most
  ulcers were caused by a bacterium and that treatment\r\nwith antibiotics cured the
  ulcer. So the original ulcer treatment was\r\nbased on a misunderstanding of the
  cause of ulcers. \r\n\r\nThe drug industry is a relatively new one. Yet is it also
  a huge\r\none economically. Perhaps as a consequence of this high-dollar label,\r\nits
  practices have come under scrutiny in the last decade or so. In\r\nspite of the
  public trust of health care in this country, many\r\npractices of the drug industry
  are not in the best interest of the\r\npatient. They instead seemed to be directed
  at promoting and selling\r\nproducts, and for a prescription drug, the key player
  in drug sales\r\nis the physician. Drug companies have thus made huge efforts to\r\ninfluence
  physicians toward selling company products. Some of the\r\nmajor (legal) practices
  that have been uncovered include: \r\n\r\n1) Drug companies have paid for\r\nuniversity
  research on their products and have then blocked\r\npublication of unfavorable results
  and/or cut continued funding of\r\nthe work when the results began to look bad.
  \r\n\r\n2) Pharmacy sales people routinely visit\r\nphysicians at work, offering
  them free lunches, free samples of\r\nmedicines, gifts, information to promote their
  products, and notepads\r\nand pens with company logos. (Next time you visit a physician,
  look\r\naround the inner rooms for evidence of company logos on charts, pens,\r\npads,
  and so on.) \r\n\r\n3) To maintain their licenses, physicians\r\nare required to
  take courses in continuing medical education (CME).\r\nThese courses are often sponsored
  and paid for by drug companies in\r\nexotic locations and with hand-picked speakers
  who provide favorable\r\ncoverage of company products. \r\n\r\n4) Drug companies
  publish ads in medical\r\njournals that look and read like research articles. These
  ads promote\r\nproducts. \r\n\r\nThese practices are not in the interest of good
  medicine, unless\r\none assumes that what is good for the drug company is good for
  us. \r\n\r\nDNA\r\nA second, well-documented case in which conflict is manifested
  is\r\nover DNA typing. These examples may not reflect current debate over\r\nDNA
  technology, but one should use them to appreciate the strong\r\npotential for conflict
  over any scientific issue in the legal system.\r\nThe rush to implement DNA typing
  in the U.S. criminal system was\r\ndone before guidelines were set for proper DNA
  typing procedures.\r\nConsequently, there were varying levels of uncertainty in
  the use of\r\nthese methods by law enforcement agencies and commercial labs. They\r\nwere
  also reluctant to admit the uncertainty. The manifestation of\r\nconflict over DNA
  evidence was thus  heated and  surfaced in the\r\npopular press on several occasions.
  We introduce this material in a\r\nprospective manner - by first imagining how the
  prosecution, defense,\r\nand forensic lab can be expected to behave to achieve their
  goals in\r\nways that are contrary to fair scientific procedure. You have already\r\nbeen
  exposed to the nature of the models and data in DNA typing, so\r\nnow the issue
  is how the different legal parties deal with the\r\nproblems in evaluation and ideal
  data.\r\nIf a case that uses DNA typing has come to trial, we can assume\r\nthat
  the DNA results support the prosecution's case.  There are thus\r\nthree parties
  in conflict:\r\nProsecution    <<< (in\r\nconflict with) >>>   Defense   <<< (in\r\nconflict
  with) >>>   DNA lab\r\nWe can assume that the DNA lab's\r\nresults support the Prosecution's
  case, or there would not be a\r\ntrial, so the conflict will lie between the Defense
  and the other two\r\nagencies.  Now consider how this conflict might be manifested.\r\nI)
  What might the prosecution do to\r\nimprove the chances of reaching its goals? \r\n\r\n1)
  eliminate test procedures that\r\n\t\tbenefit the suspect (eliminate standards;
  build a case of\r\n\t\tcircumstantial evidence to shield criticism of the DNA fingerprint\r\n\t\tevidence).
  \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t2) harass or impede prior\r\n\t\twitnesses for the defense who might
  testify in the future. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t3) keep a list of sympathetic\r\n\t\texpert
  witnesses \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t4) Maintain positive relationships with labs that have\r\n\t\tcontributed
  to convictions in the past. \r\n\t\t\r\n\tII) With respect to the errors and\r\nuncertainties
  of DNA evidence in specific cases: \r\n\r\n5) argue that inconsistencies are\r\n\t\tplausible
  artifacts \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t6) fail to question any outcome in its favor \r\n\t\t\r\n\tIII)
  How is the defense likely to behave? \r\n\t\r\n1) keep a list of sympathetic\r\n\t\texpert
  witnesses \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t2) emphasize all inconsistencies\r\n\t\tin the DNA analyses
  as evidence of innocence \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t3) question all assumptions, original data,
  calculations \r\n\t\t\r\n\tIV) How is the lab likely to behave? \r\n\t\r\n1) Produce
  results that enhance\r\n\t\tthe goals of their economic benefactor, including \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t2)
  establish a reputation for a\r\n\t\tlack of indecisiveness; overstate case \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t3)
  defend its initial conclusions \r\n\t\t\r\n\tEvidence from DNA cases\r\nThe case
  histories available from the last 4-5 years of DNA\r\nforensics verify many of these
  expectations. In particular, DNA\r\ntesting has omitted such basic elements as standards
  and blind\r\nprocedures (I.1 above); the prosecution in the Castro case ignored\r\ninconsistencies
  in the evidence (I.5, I.6); the lab in the Castro\r\ncase overstated the significance
  of a match and defended such\r\npractices as failing to include a male control for
  the male-specific\r\nprobe (III.2, III.3). Defense and prosecution agencies definitely\r\nkeep
  lists of sympathetic witnesses (I.3, II.1), and defense agencies\r\nindeed choose
  witnesses to challenge the nature of DNA evidence based\r\non its (necessarily false)
  assumptions (II.3). And finally,\r\nharassment by the prosecution of experts who
  testify for the defense\r\nis well documented, both in the courtroom and outside
  (I.2). This\r\nharassment includes character assassination on the witness stand,\r\nimplied
  threats to personal liberties for witnesses who were in the\r\nU.S. on visas, and
  contacts made to journal editors to prevent\r\npublication of papers submitted by
  the witness. Some of these cases\r\nhave been described in the popular press, and
  others are known to us\r\nthrough contacts with our colleagues. These latter manifestations
  of\r\nconflict don't make sense in the context of a single trial, but they\r\nstem
  from the fact that networks exist in which prosecuting attorneys\r\nshare information
  and parallel networks exist among defense\r\nattorneys.  Expert witnesses are often
  used in multiple trials across\r\nthe country, so any expert witness who is discouraged
  at the end of\r\none trial will be less likely to participate in future trials,
  and\r\nconversely, an expert who does well in a trial may be more likely to\r\nparticipate
  in future trials.  \r\n\r\nThe suggestions of harassment have even extended to scientists
  who\r\nmerely publish criticisms of forensic applications of DNA typing. In\r\nthe
  1991-92 Christmas break, two papers were published in Science on\r\nopposites of
  the DNA fingerprinting conflict (Science 254: 1745-50,\r\nand 1735-39). At the same
  time, news items were also published in\r\nScience, Nature, The New York Times,
  and The Washington Post, in\r\nwhich the details of this conflict were aired in
  full detail. The\r\nauthors of the paper opposing use of current DNA typing methods\r\n(Lewontin
  & Hartl) were phoned by a Justice Department official\r\nand allegedly threatened
  with retaliation (having their federal\r\nfunding jeopardized); the official denied
  the threats but did not\r\ndeny the phone call. The Lewontin-Hartl article had apparently
  been\r\nleaked in advance of publication, and an editor for Science contacted\r\nthe
  head editor to have a rebuttal published. However, it turned out\r\nthat the editor
  requesting the rebuttal owns a patent for DNA\r\nfingerprinting and stands to benefit
  financially by forensic use of\r\nDNA typing methods. The two authors chosen for
  the rebuttal had been\r\nfunded by the FBI to work on DNA fingerprinting methods.
  So, there\r\nappears to have been some serious conflicts of interest at least on\r\none
  side of the issue.\r\nThis treatment of conflict in DNA trials has omitted a 4th\r\ncategory
  of people whose goals may conflict with the agencies above: \r\nthe expert witnesses
  themselves.  The goals of expert witnesses may\r\nbe varied, including monetary
  (the standard rate is $1000/day in\r\ncourt), notoriety, and philosophical (e.g.,
  some people volunteer to\r\nassist the defense on a no-cost basis, merely to ensure
  a fair\r\ntrial).  \r\n\r\nEMFs\r\nThe last specific example to be discussed concerns
  some old\r\nexamples of conflict between power companies and population exposure\r\nto
  high-intensity EMFs. The primary conflict has been between the\r\npeople exposed
  to EMFs (e.g. those living under high-voltage power\r\nlines) and corporations or
  government agencies responsible for\r\nvarious aspects of electric power. In a series
  of three articles in\r\nThe New Yorker (12, 19, and 26 June, 1989), Paul Brodeur\r\ndescribed
  in a somewhat sensationalist manner how various agencies\r\ndealt with the potentially
  damaging evidence that EMF-emitting\r\nutilities may be harmful, the various extents
  to which they attempted\r\nto obscure and suppress evidence contrary to their views,
  along with\r\nthe suspicious ill fates that befell the careers of scientists who\r\ntestified
  in opposition to these organizations. For example, the Navy\r\n\"classified\" a
  report of such evidences to prevent its\r\ndissemination. The New York Power Company
  attempted to discredit\r\nscientists testifying against it. Witnesses testifying
  against the\r\nNYPC lost appointments and funding. The President of the National\r\nAcademy
  threatened to sue the Saturday Review for an article\r\ncriticizing its own investigation
  of this matter. Fortunately, the\r\nsuppression of possible harmful effects of EMFs
  happears to have\r\nsubsided, and power companies have even recently funded research
  into\r\nthe problem.\r\nThe footprints of bias: Generalities\r\nThe attempt to deceive
  in science may take many specific forms. At\r\na general level, arguments may avoid
  the scientific method entirely,\r\nor they may instead appear to follow scientific
  procedure but violate\r\none or more elements of the scientific method (models,
  data,\r\nevaluation, revision). The next few sections of this chapter describe\r\ndifferent
  kinds and levels of possible bias at a level that\r\ntranscends specific cases.
  These generalities are useful in that they\r\nenable you to detect bias without
  knowing the specifics of the\r\nsituation.\r\nThe standard scientific approach to
  evaluating a model is to\r\ngather data. If you suspect bias (e.g., you doubt the
  claim of\r\nsupport for a model), the ideal approach is to simply gather the\r\nrelevant
  data yourself and evaluate the claim. But this approach\r\nrequires time that none
  of us have (we can't research everything). In\r\nmany cases, blatant examples of
  bias can be detected by noting some\r\nsimple features of a situation..\r\nLook
  for Conflict of Interest\r\nThe first and easiest clue to assist you in anticipating\r\ndeliberate
  bias is conflict of interest. If another party's goal\r\ndiffers from your goal,
  and your goal is to seek the\r\nscientific \"truth\", then there is a good chance
  that that\r\nparty is biased -- just as you may be biased if YOUR goal differs\r\nfrom
  seeking scientific truth. Service on many Federal panels\r\nrequires a declaration
  of all conflicts of interest in advance (and\r\nyou will be excused from consideration
  where those conflicts lie).\r\nThat is, the government avoids the mere appearance
  of bias based on\r\nthe existence of conflict, without looking for evidence of actual\r\nbias.
  However, in our daily lives, we are confronted with conflict at\r\nevery turn, and
  we can't simply avoid bias by avoiding interactions\r\ninvolving conflict (e.g.,
  every time you make a purchase, there is a\r\nconflict of interest between you and
  the seller). Thus, being aware\r\nof conflict is a first step in avoiding bias,
  but you can also\r\nbenefit by watching for a few symptoms of bias.\r\nNon-scientific
  arguments (blatant bias)\r\nSometimes, someone is so biased that they resort to
  lines of\r\nreasoning and argumentation that are clearly in violation of science.\r\nThese
  cases are easy to expose, because they can be detected without\r\neven looking at
  data or analysis. And many of them are already\r\nfamiliar to you, as given in the
  following table:\r\nArguments in Violation of the Scientific Method\r\n\r\n\t\t\tAppeal
  to authority \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tAppeal to authority is the defense
  of a model by indicating that the model is endorsed by someone well known (an authority).
  \ A model should stand on its own merits. The fact that a\r\n\t\t\tparticular person
  supports the model is irrelevant, though the\r\n\t\t\tspecifics of what they have
  to say may assist you in evaluating\r\n\t\t\tthe model. \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\tCharacter
  assassination of opponent \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tCharacter assassination
  is the attempt to discredit someone's character (e.g., point out that they associate
  with undesirable people, etc.).  The character of somebody is irrelevant to the
  evidence they\r\n\t\t\tpresent that supports or refutes the model. We should evaluate
  the\r\n\t\t\tevidence, not the person presenting it. \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\tRefusal
  to admit error \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tRefusal to admit error is the
  refusal to specify the conditions under which a model should be rejected or the
  refusal to accept its refutation in the face of solid evidence against it.  All
  models are false, and anyone who refuses to discuss how\r\n\t\t\ttheir model could
  be seriously in error is obscuring a fair\r\n\t\t\tappraisal of their model (or
  is using an unfalsifiable model) \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\tIdentify trivial
  flaws in an opponent's model \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tThis violation
  refers to the practice of searching for unimportant details about a model that are
  false, and using those minor limitations as the basis for refuting the model. The
  fact that all models are false does not mean that all are\r\n\t\t\tuseless. Yet
  it is a common trick of lawyers to harp endlessly on\r\n\t\t\tthe fact that a particular
  model advocated by their opponent is\r\n\t\t\tnot perfect and thus should be abandoned.
  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\tDefend an unfalsifiable model \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA
  model must be falsifiable to be useful.  \"Falsifiable\" merely means that it could
  be refuted if the data turn out to be a certain way.  An unfalsifiable model is
  one that cannot be refuted no matter how the data turn out.  Creationists, for example,
  adopt and then defend an\r\n\t\t\tunfalsifiable model. An unfalsifiable model is
  one that is framed\r\n\t\t\tso that we could never gather data to show it is wrong.
  By\r\n\t\t\tcontrast, science is predicated on the assumption that all models\r\n\t\t\twill
  eventually be overturned. \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\tRequire refutation of
  all alternatives\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA special case of defending an unfalsifiable
  model, this one is\r\n\t\t\tsubtle. It is takes the form of insisting that a class
  of models is correct until all variations of them have been rejected.  As an example,
  we might refuse to accept that the probability of Heads in a coin flip is 0.5 unless
  we reject all alternatives to 0.5.  Whereas it is possible to refute that the probability
  of Heads in\r\n\t\t\ta coin flip is 1/2, it is impossible to refute that the\r\n\t\t\tprobability
  of Heads is anything other than 1/2, because that\r\n\t\t\twould mean showing it
  is exactly 1/2. (It would take an infinite number of flips to reject everything
  other than 1/2.)  This argument also takes the form\r\n\t\t\tof claiming that there
  is some truth to a model until it has been shown that there is nothing to it at
  all. \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\tUse anecdotes and post hoc observations\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\nThis
  category represents a non-systematic presentation of special cases made in defense
  of (rather than as a test of) a particular model.   \r\nAn anecdote is an isolated,
  often informal observation made without a systematic, thorough evaluation of the
  available evidence.\r\nAs a selected observation, it is not necessarily representative
  of a systematic survey of the relevant observations.  \r\nPost hoc observations
  are observations made after the fact, often to bolster a particular model.  It is
  easy to select unrepresentative data that support almost any model.\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t \r\nPerhaps
  the most subtle but useful of these points is the refusal\r\nto admit error. In
  science, models are tested precisely because the\r\nscientist acknowledges that
  every model has imperfections which may\r\nwarrant its abandonment. Someone who
  is trying to advocate a model\r\nmay want to suppress all doubt about its imperfections
  and thus\r\nsuggest that it can't be wrong. That attitude is a sure sign that the\r\nperson
  is biased. Of course, in many cases you will already know that\r\nthe person is
  biased (as with a car salesperson), and the best that\r\nyou can hope for is to
  determine how much they deviate from\r\nobjectivity.\r\nSubtle violations of the
  scientific method: Experimental design\r\nThe template for ideal data presented
  earlier is a strategy for\r\nproducing data with a minimum of bias. But the template
  can be\r\napplied in many ways, and someone with a goal of biasing data can\r\nnonetheless
  adhere to this template and still generate biased data.\r\nLet's consider a pharmaceutical
  company testing the efficacy of a new\r\ndrug. How many ways can we imagine that
  the data reported from such a\r\nstudy might be deliberately biased, when the trials
  are undertaken by\r\nthe company that would profit from marketing the drug? The
  following\r\ntable lists a few of the possibilities.\r\nBogus designs\r\n\r\n\t\t\tViolation
  of accepted procedure\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tImpact\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\tChange
  design in mid-course\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tAn investigator may terminate an experiment
  prematurely if it\r\n\t\t\tis producing unwanted results; if the experiment is never\r\n\t\t\tcompleted,
  it will not be reported.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\tAssay for a narrow spectrum of unlikely
  results\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tThe public well being is many-faceted, and a product
  is\r\n\t\t\tunlikely to have a negative impact on more than a few facets. With\r\n\t\t\tadvance
  knowledge of the likely negative effects (e.g., a drug\r\n\t\t\tcauses brain cancer),
  a study can be designed to purposefully omit\r\n\t\t\tmeasuring those negative effects
  and focus on others (e.g., colon\r\n\t\t\tcancer). Were the subjects a fair sample
  of the relevant\r\n\t\t\tpopulation? The medicine might be more effective on some
  age\r\n\t\t\tgroups than others, so the study might be confined to the most\r\n\t\t\tresponsive
  age groups (determined in preliminary trials). While\r\n\t\t\tthe data would be
  accurate as reported, details of the age group\r\n\t\t\tmight be omitted to encourage
  a broader interpretation of the\r\n\t\t\tresults than is warranted.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\tProtocol
  concealed\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIt is easy to write a protocol that conceals
  how the study was actually conducted in some important respects.  For example, was
  a blind design really used? Although a blind design exists\r\n\t\t\ton paper, it
  is possible to let patients and staff know which\r\n\t\t\tpatients belong to which
  groups. Indeed, patients can sometimes\r\n\t\t\tdetermine whether they are receiving
  the drug or placebo. Were the\r\n\t\t\tcontrols treated in exactly the same manner
  as the group receiving\r\n\t\t\tthe medicine? It is possible to describe countless
  ways in which\r\n\t\t\tthe control group and treatment group were treated similarly,
  yet\r\n\t\t\tto omit ways in which they were treated differently. The medicine\r\n\t\t\tmight
  be given along with some other substance that can affect\r\n\t\t\tpatient response,
  with this additional substance being omitted\r\n\t\t\tfrom the placebo.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\tSmall
  samples\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tScience often assumes \"innocent until proven guilty\"\r\n\t\t\tin
  interpreting experiments designed to determine if a product is\r\n\t\t\thazardous.
  Small samples increase the difficulty of demonstrating\r\n\t\t\tthat a compound
  is hazardous, even when it really is.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\tNon-random assignments\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tMost
  studies, especially those of humans, begin with enough\r\n\t\t\tvariation among
  subjects that random assignment to control or\r\n\t\t\ttreatment groups is essential
  to eliminate a multitude of\r\n\t\t\tconfounding factors. Clever non-random assignments
  could produce a\r\n\t\t\tstrong bias in favor of either outcome.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\tPseudo
  controls\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tThere are many dimensions to the proper establishment
  of\r\n\t\t\tcontrols, including assignment of the control groups and\r\n\t\t\tsubsequent
  treatment of the controls. It is possible to describe\r\n\t\t\tmany ways in which
  a control is treated properly while omitting\r\n\t\t\tother ways in which a control
  is treated differently.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t \r\nWe can obviously find additional ways
  to bias the outcome of\r\ntests. Short of undertaking the study yourself, or having
  a neutral\r\norganization conduct the study, there are always ways to present a\r\nbiased
  model comparison while nonetheless being absolutely truthful\r\nabout the experimental
  design.\r\nBiased model evaluation\r\nEven when the raw data themselves were gathered
  with the utmost\r\ncare, there is still great opportunity for bias. Bias can arise
  as\r\neasily during data analysis, synthesis and interpretation, as during\r\ndata
  gathering. This idea is captured in the title of a book\r\npublished some years
  ago, \"How to Lie With Statistics.\" Two\r\nmethods of biasing evaluation are (i)
  throwing out some of the\r\nresults, and (ii) searching for a statistical test to
  support a\r\ndesired outcome.\r\nThrowing out results. We often assume that a study
  reports\r\nall relevant results. But studies often have (valid) reasons for\r\nthrowing
  out certain results. Throwing out results can also bias a\r\nstudy, however. If
  we flip a coin ten times, and we repeat this\r\nexperiment enough times, we will
  eventually obtain 10 heads in some\r\ntrials and ten tails in others. We might then
  report that a random\r\ncoin flip test produced ten head (or tails), even though
  the entire\r\nset of results produced an equal number of heads and tails - by\r\nfailing
  to report some results, we have biased those that we do\r\nreport. For example,
  a product test may have been repeated many\r\ntimes, with the ones finally published
  being limited to those\r\nfavoring the product.\r\nThis principle applies widely.
  In a court case, the defense will\r\nonly present the data that they have that tends
  to exonerate their\r\nclient. In other cases, the models being tested during the
  evaluation\r\nand revision step of the scientific method are not representative
  of\r\nall those that could be compared. For example, the U.S. Forest\r\nService,
  when writing management plans for National Forests, is often\r\nrequired to compare
  several alternative management options. The bias\r\narises because the alternative
  options (e.g. models) that the U.S.\r\nForest Service considers are not always representative
  of all\r\npossible management options. Hence the models being evaluated are a\r\nbiased
  subset of all those conceivable.\r\nSearching for the \"right\" test. There are\r\nhundreds
  of ways to conduct statistical tests. Some study designs fit\r\ncleanly into standardized
  statistical procedures, but in many cases,\r\nunexpected results dictate that statistical
  tests be modified to suit\r\nthe circumstances. Thus, any one data set may have
  dozens to hundreds\r\nof ways of being analyzed. In reporting the results, someone
  may bias\r\nthe evaluation step by reporting only those tests favorable to a\r\nparticular
  goal. We should point out that this practice offers a\r\nlimited opportunity to
  bias an evaluation. If the data strongly\r\nsupport a particular result, it won't
  be easy to find an acceptable\r\ntest which obscures that result. \r\n\r\nVery subtle
  bias: Controlling the null model\r\n\r\nAs noted in a previous chapter, \r\nmany
  evaluations are based on a \r\nnull\r\nmodel approach: \r\nthe null model is accepted
  until proven\r\nwrong. \r\nTo \"control\" the \r\nnull model means to \"choose\"
  the null model.  \r\nChoice of the null model can have a big effect on the outcome\r\nof
  even the most unbiased scientific evaluation for the simple reason that a null model
  is accepted until proven guilty.  Any uncertainty or inadequacy in the data will
  thus rule in favor of the null model.   By choosing the null model, therefore, many
  of the studies testing the model will \"accept\" it, not because the evidence for
  it is strong, but because the evidence against it is weak.  As a consequence, the
  null model enjoys a protected status, and it is to anyone's advantage to choose
  which model is adopted as the null model.  Choice of the null model in this sense
  does not even mean developing it or proposing/inventing it.  Given a set of alternatives
  decided upon in advance, controlling the null model means simply the selection of
  which model from that set is adopted.\r\n\r\nConsider the two alternative models
  that might be used in\r\napproving a new food additive for baby formula:\r\na) food
  additives are considered harmful unless proven safe to\r\n\t\tsome limit\r\n\t\tb)
  food additives are considered safe unless shown to be harmful\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\tAs
  the null model, (a) requires a rigorous demonstration of the\r\nsafety of a food
  additive before it is approved. In contrast, (b)\r\nrequires that an additive can
  be used until a harmful effect is\r\ndemonstrated. As noted in the Data chapters,
  an enormous sample size\r\nmight be required to demonstrate a mild harmful effect,
  so a harmful\r\nproduct could reach market much more easily under null model (b)
  than\r\nunder (a). \r\n\r\nChoice of the null model represents a powerful yet potentially\r\nsubtle
  way in which an entire program of research can be biased.\r\nEvery other aspect
  of design, models used, and evaluation could meet\r\nacceptable standards, yet choice
  of a null model favorable to one\r\nside in a conflict will bias many outcomes in
  favor of that side.\r\nMinimizing the abuses\r\nRecognizing the possible abuses
  of science is the simplest and\r\nmost effective way to avoid being subjected to
  them. Beyond this, we\r\ncan think of no single simple rule to follow that will
  minimize the\r\nopportunity for someone to violate the spirit of science and present\r\nmisleading
  results -- there are countless ways to bias data. One\r\nstrategy to avoid bias
  is to require detailed, explicit protocols.\r\nAnother is to have the data gathered
  by and individual or company\r\nlacking a vested interest in the outcome. But even
  with these\r\npolicies, there is no guarantee that deliberate biases can be weeded\r\nout.

  used biased (but perhaps, \r\nwell-intentioned) methods \r\nin\r\n\t\t\t\r\narriving
  at \r\nconclusions. \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\tWhen proper scientific procedure
  is undermined by conflicting\r\ngoals so that it results in deception, we say it
  is biased. This form\r\nof bias is prevalent in advertising - companies universally
  advocate\r\ntheir products, emphasizing product assets while concealing product\r\nfaults
  and concealing the advantages of competitor products. You\r\ndon't expect an advertisement
  from a private company to offer a fair\r\nappraisal of the commodity. But bias even
  exists in the way that\r\nstates promote their lotteries by advertising the number
  of winners\r\nand money \"given away\" without telling you the number of\r\nlosers
  and money taken in.Deliberate bias occurs in science as well as in business and\r\npolitics.
  The potential for bias arises when a scientist has some\r\ngoal other than (or in
  addition to) finding an accurate model of\r\nnature, such as increasing profits,
  furthering a political cause, or\r\nprotecting funding. As an example, the environmental
  consulting firm\r\nthat renders an opinion about the environmental effects of the
  latest\r\nsubdivision may not give a completely accurate assessment. The future\r\nwork
  that this firm receives from developers is likely to depend on\r\nwhat they say.
  If the developers don't like the assessment, they will\r\nlikely find another environmental
  next time. Thus there is a conflict\r\nbetween obtaining an unbiased model, and
  making the largest profit\r\npossible. In these cases, the scientists are motivated
  to present\r\nbiased arguments. There are many situations which present a conflict\r\nbetween
  scientific objectivity and some other goal. \r\nWe take for granted an unlimited
  supply of medicinal drugs. If we\r\nget pneumonia, gonorrhea, HIV, or cancer, the
  drugs of choice are\r\ninvariably available. They may not cure us, but whatever
  drugs we\r\nknow about (that have been approved) are in abundant supply. \r\nFor
  the most part, this abundance of and reliance on drugs comes\r\nfrom public trust
  of health care. We don't imagine that our doctors\r\ntry to prescribe us useless
  or unnecessary drugs (if anything, the\r\npatient often requests drugs when they
  are unnecessary). But in\r\nreality, many drugs ARE unnecessary, and some drugs
  are no better\r\nthan cheaper alternatives. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
  is\r\ncharged with approving new foods and drugs for the U.S. In 1992, it\r\nwas
  approving about 20 new drugs a year but regarded only about 20%\r\nof those as true
  advances. So many drugs are no better than\r\nalternatives (many are obviously at
  least slightly worse than\r\nalternatives). And physicians often don't have the
  evidence to know\r\nwhich drugs are best. \r\nThe goals of consumers are in conflict
  with those of drug\r\ncompanies in some respects. \r\nThe consumer wants drugs that\r\nare\r\nIf
  two drugs are equally effective, we want the cheaper one. We may\r\neven not want
  the most effective drug if a cheaper one will do the\r\ntrick. \r\nBut the goals
  of any drug company\r\nare different:which may involveIt costs to hundreds of millions
  of dollars to get a drug approved\r\nby the FDA now. Much of the cost is in research
  and trials, but even\r\nFDA consideration itself costs millions. So it is not cheap.
  Most\r\nimportant is time, because the sooner a drug hits the market, the\r\nsooner
  the company reaps the benefits. So drug companies have strong\r\nincentives to market
  any product that is approved by the FDA -- once\r\napproved, the major costs of
  money (and time) have already been\r\nborne. \r\nOf course, it does not behoove
  a company to market a harmful\r\nproduct -- liability costs can be quite high. But
  most products that\r\npass all the hurdles of FDA approval can be regarded as harmless
  at\r\nworst. The drug company has a very strong incentive to market its\r\napproved
  products regardless of whether the consumer benefits or not.\r\nOne of the most
  economically successful drugs ever was an ulcer\r\nmedicine that reduced suffering.
  It did not cure ulcers but instead\r\nhad to be taken as long as the patient had
  the ulcer. Research later\r\nfound that most ulcers were caused by a bacterium and
  that treatment\r\nwith antibiotics cured the ulcer. So the original ulcer treatment
  was\r\nbased on a misunderstanding of the cause of ulcers. \r\nThe drug industry
  is a relatively new one. Yet is it also a huge\r\none economically. Perhaps as a
  consequence of this high-dollar label,\r\nits practices have come under scrutiny
  in the last decade or so. In\r\nspite of the public trust of health care in this
  country, many\r\npractices of the drug industry are not in the best interest of
  the\r\npatient. They instead seemed to be directed at promoting and selling\r\nproducts,
  and for a prescription drug, the key player in drug sales\r\nis the physician. Drug
  companies have thus made huge efforts to\r\ninfluence physicians toward selling
  company products. Some of the\r\nmajor (legal) practices that have been uncovered
  include: \r\n1) Drug companies have paid for\r\nuniversity research on their products
  and have then blocked\r\npublication of unfavorable results and/or cut continued
  funding of\r\nthe work when the results began to look bad. \r\n2) Pharmacy sales
  people routinely visit\r\nphysicians at work, offering them free lunches, free samples
  of\r\nmedicines, gifts, information to promote their products, and notepads\r\nand
  pens with company logos. (Next time you visit a physician, look\r\naround the inner
  rooms for evidence of company logos on charts, pens,\r\npads, and so on.) \r\n3)
  To maintain their licenses, physicians\r\nare required to take courses in continuing
  medical education (CME).\r\nThese courses are often sponsored and paid for by drug
  companies in\r\nexotic locations and with hand-picked speakers who provide favorable\r\ncoverage
  of company products. \r\n4) Drug companies publish ads in medical\r\njournals that
  look and read like research articles. These ads promote\r\nproducts. \r\nThese practices
  are not in the interest of good medicine, unless\r\none assumes that what is good
  for the drug company is good for us. \r\nA second, well-documented case in which
  conflict is manifested is\r\nover DNA typing. These examples may not reflect current
  debate over\r\nDNA technology, but one should use them to appreciate the strong\r\npotential
  for conflict over any scientific issue in the legal system.The rush to implement
  DNA typing in the U.S. criminal system was\r\ndone before guidelines were set for
  proper DNA typing procedures.\r\nConsequently, there were varying levels of uncertainty
  in the use of\r\nthese methods by law enforcement agencies and commercial labs.
  They\r\nwere also reluctant to admit the uncertainty. The manifestation of\r\nconflict
  over DNA evidence was thus  heated and  surfaced in the\r\npopular press on several
  occasions. We introduce this material in a\r\nprospective manner - by first imagining
  how the prosecution, defense,\r\nand forensic lab can be expected to behave to achieve
  their goals in\r\nways that are contrary to fair scientific procedure. You have
  already\r\nbeen exposed to the nature of the models and data in DNA typing, so\r\nnow
  the issue is how the different legal parties deal with the\r\nproblems in evaluation
  and ideal data.If a case that uses DNA typing has come to trial, we can assume\r\nthat
  the DNA results support the prosecution's case.  There are thus\r\nthree parties
  in conflict:Prosecution    <<< (in\r\nconflict with) >>>   Defense   <<< (in\r\nconflict
  with) >>>   DNA labWe can assume that the DNA lab's\r\nresults support the Prosecution's
  case, or there would not be a\r\ntrial, so the conflict will lie between the Defense
  and the other two\r\nagencies.  Now consider how this conflict might be manifested.I)
  What might the prosecution do to\r\nimprove the chances of reaching its goals? \r\nII)
  With respect to the errors and\r\nuncertainties of DNA evidence in specific cases:
  \r\n5) argue that inconsistencies are\r\n\t\tplausible artifacts \r\n\t\t6) fail
  to question any outcome in its favor \r\n\t\tIII) How is the defense likely to behave?
  \r\n\t1) keep a list of sympathetic\r\n\t\texpert witnesses \r\n\t\t2) emphasize
  all inconsistencies\r\n\t\tin the DNA analyses as evidence of innocence \r\n\t\t3)
  question all assumptions, original data, calculations \r\n\t\tIV) How is the lab
  likely to behave? \r\n\t1) Produce results that enhance\r\n\t\tthe goals of their
  economic benefactor, including \r\n\t\t2) establish a reputation for a\r\n\t\tlack
  of indecisiveness; overstate case \r\n\t\t3) defend its initial conclusions \r\n\t\tThe
  case histories available from the last 4-5 years of DNA\r\nforensics verify many
  of these expectations. In particular, DNA\r\ntesting has omitted such basic elements
  as standards and blind\r\nprocedures (I.1 above); the prosecution in the Castro
  case ignored\r\ninconsistencies in the evidence (I.5, I.6); the lab in the Castro\r\ncase
  overstated the significance of a match and defended such\r\npractices as failing
  to include a male control for the male-specific\r\nprobe (III.2, III.3). Defense
  and prosecution agencies definitely\r\nkeep lists of sympathetic witnesses (I.3,
  II.1), and defense agencies\r\nindeed choose witnesses to challenge the nature of
  DNA evidence based\r\non its (necessarily false) assumptions (II.3). And finally,\r\nharassment
  by the prosecution of experts who testify for the defense\r\nis well documented,
  both in the courtroom and outside (I.2). This\r\nharassment includes character assassination
  on the witness stand,\r\nimplied threats to personal liberties for witnesses who
  were in the\r\nU.S. on visas, and contacts made to journal editors to prevent\r\npublication
  of papers submitted by the witness. Some of these cases\r\nhave been described in
  the popular press, and others are known to us\r\nthrough contacts with our colleagues.
  These latter manifestations of\r\nconflict don't make sense in the context of a
  single trial, but they\r\nstem from the fact that networks exist in which prosecuting
  attorneys\r\nshare information and parallel networks exist among defense\r\nattorneys.
  \ Expert witnesses are often used in multiple trials across\r\nthe country, so any
  expert witness who is discouraged at the end of\r\none trial will be less likely
  to participate in future trials, and\r\nconversely, an expert who does well in a
  trial may be more likely to\r\nparticipate in future trials.  \r\nThe suggestions
  of harassment have even extended to scientists who\r\nmerely publish criticisms
  of forensic applications of DNA typing. In\r\nthe 1991-92 Christmas break, two papers
  were published in Science on\r\nopposites of the DNA fingerprinting conflict (Science
  254: 1745-50,\r\nand 1735-39). At the same time, news items were also published
  in\r\nScience, Nature, The New York Times, and The Washington Post, in\r\nwhich
  the details of this conflict were aired in full detail. The\r\nauthors of the paper
  opposing use of current DNA typing methods\r\n(Lewontin & Hartl) were phoned by
  a Justice Department official\r\nand allegedly threatened with retaliation (having
  their federal\r\nfunding jeopardized); the official denied the threats but did not\r\ndeny
  the phone call. The Lewontin-Hartl article had apparently been\r\nleaked in advance
  of publication, and an editor for Science contacted\r\nthe head editor to have a
  rebuttal published. However, it turned out\r\nthat the editor requesting the rebuttal
  owns a patent for DNA\r\nfingerprinting and stands to benefit financially by forensic
  use of\r\nDNA typing methods. The two authors chosen for the rebuttal had been\r\nfunded
  by the FBI to work on DNA fingerprinting methods. So, there\r\nappears to have been
  some serious conflicts of interest at least on\r\none side of the issue.This treatment
  of conflict in DNA trials has omitted a 4th\r\ncategory of people whose goals may
  conflict with the agencies above: \r\nthe expert witnesses themselves.  The goals
  of expert witnesses may\r\nbe varied, including monetary (the standard rate is $1000/day
  in\r\ncourt), notoriety, and philosophical (e.g., some people volunteer to\r\nassist
  the defense on a no-cost basis, merely to ensure a fair\r\ntrial).  \r\nThe last
  specific example to be discussed concerns some old\r\nexamples of conflict between
  power companies and population exposure\r\nto high-intensity EMFs. The primary conflict
  has been between the\r\npeople exposed to EMFs (e.g. those living under high-voltage
  power\r\nlines) and corporations or government agencies responsible for\r\nvarious
  aspects of electric power. In a series of three articles in\r\nThe New Yorker (12,
  19, and 26 June, 1989), Paul Brodeur\r\ndescribed in a somewhat sensationalist manner
  how various agencies\r\ndealt with the potentially damaging evidence that EMF-emitting\r\nutilities
  may be harmful, the various extents to which they attempted\r\nto obscure and suppress
  evidence contrary to their views, along with\r\nthe suspicious ill fates that befell
  the careers of scientists who\r\ntestified in opposition to these organizations.
  For example, the Navy\r\n\"classified\" a report of such evidences to prevent its\r\ndissemination.
  The New York Power Company attempted to discredit\r\nscientists testifying against
  it. Witnesses testifying against the\r\nNYPC lost appointments and funding. The
  President of the National\r\nAcademy threatened to sue the Saturday Review for an
  article\r\ncriticizing its own investigation of this matter. Fortunately, the\r\nsuppression
  of possible harmful effects of EMFs happears to have\r\nsubsided, and power companies
  have even recently funded research into\r\nthe problem.The attempt to deceive in
  science may take many specific forms. At\r\na general level, arguments may avoid
  the scientific method entirely,\r\nor they may instead appear to follow scientific
  procedure but violate\r\none or more elements of the scientific method (models,
  data,\r\nevaluation, revision). The next few sections of this chapter describe\r\ndifferent
  kinds and levels of possible bias at a level that\r\ntranscends specific cases.
  These generalities are useful in that they\r\nenable you to detect bias without
  knowing the specifics of the\r\nsituation.The standard scientific approach to evaluating
  a model is to\r\ngather data. If you suspect bias (e.g., you doubt the claim of\r\nsupport
  for a model), the ideal approach is to simply gather the\r\nrelevant data yourself
  and evaluate the claim. But this approach\r\nrequires time that none of us have
  (we can't research everything). In\r\nmany cases, blatant examples of bias can be
  detected by noting some\r\nsimple features of a situation..Look for Conflict of
  InterestThe first and easiest clue to assist you in anticipating\r\ndeliberate bias
  is conflict of interest. If another party's goal\r\ndiffers from your goal, and
  your goal is to seek the\r\nscientific \"truth\", then there is a good chance that
  that\r\nparty is biased -- just as you may be biased if YOUR goal differs\r\nfrom
  seeking scientific truth. Service on many Federal panels\r\nrequires a declaration
  of all conflicts of interest in advance (and\r\nyou will be excused from consideration
  where those conflicts lie).\r\nThat is, the government avoids the mere appearance
  of bias based on\r\nthe existence of conflict, without looking for evidence of actual\r\nbias.
  However, in our daily lives, we are confronted with conflict at\r\nevery turn, and
  we can't simply avoid bias by avoiding interactions\r\ninvolving conflict (e.g.,
  every time you make a purchase, there is a\r\nconflict of interest between you and
  the seller). Thus, being aware\r\nof conflict is a first step in avoiding bias,
  but you can also\r\nbenefit by watching for a few symptoms of bias.Sometimes, someone
  is so biased that they resort to lines of\r\nreasoning and argumentation that are
  clearly in violation of science.\r\nThese cases are easy to expose, because they
  can be detected without\r\neven looking at data or analysis. And many of them are
  already\r\nfamiliar to you, as given in the following table:Arguments in Violation
  of the Scientific MethodAppeal to authority \r\n\t\t\tAppeal to authority is the
  defense of a model by indicating that the model is endorsed by someone well known
  (an authority).  A model should stand on its own merits. The fact that a\r\n\t\t\tparticular
  person supports the model is irrelevant, though the\r\n\t\t\tspecifics of what they
  have to say may assist you in evaluating\r\n\t\t\tthe model. \r\n\t\t\tCharacter
  assassination of opponent \r\n\t\t\tCharacter assassination is the attempt to discredit
  someone's character (e.g., point out that they associate with undesirable people,
  etc.).  The character of somebody is irrelevant to the evidence they\r\n\t\t\tpresent
  that supports or refutes the model. We should evaluate the\r\n\t\t\tevidence, not
  the person presenting it. \r\n\t\t\tRefusal to admit error \r\n\t\t\tRefusal to
  admit error is the refusal to specify the conditions under which a model should
  be rejected or the refusal to accept its refutation in the face of solid evidence
  against it.  All models are false, and anyone who refuses to discuss how\r\n\t\t\ttheir
  model could be seriously in error is obscuring a fair\r\n\t\t\tappraisal of their
  model (or is using an unfalsifiable model) \r\n\t\t\tIdentify trivial flaws in an
  opponent's model \r\n\t\t\tThis violation refers to the practice of searching for
  unimportant details about a model that are false, and using those minor limitations
  as the basis for refuting the model. The fact that all models are false does not
  mean that all are\r\n\t\t\tuseless. Yet it is a common trick of lawyers to harp
  endlessly on\r\n\t\t\tthe fact that a particular model advocated by their opponent
  is\r\n\t\t\tnot perfect and thus should be abandoned. \r\n\t\t\tDefend an unfalsifiable
  model \r\n\t\t\tA model must be falsifiable to be useful.  \"Falsifiable\" merely
  means that it could be refuted if the data turn out to be a certain way.  An unfalsifiable
  model is one that cannot be refuted no matter how the data turn out.  Creationists,
  for example, adopt and then defend an\r\n\t\t\tunfalsifiable model. An unfalsifiable
  model is one that is framed\r\n\t\t\tso that we could never gather data to show
  it is wrong. By\r\n\t\t\tcontrast, science is predicated on the assumption that
  all models\r\n\t\t\twill eventually be overturned. \r\n\t\t\tRequire refutation
  of all alternativesA special case of defending an unfalsifiable model, this one
  is\r\n\t\t\tsubtle. It is takes the form of insisting that a class of models is
  correct until all variations of them have been rejected.  As an example, we might
  refuse to accept that the probability of Heads in a coin flip is 0.5 unless we reject
  all alternatives to 0.5.  Whereas it is possible to refute that the probability
  of Heads in\r\n\t\t\ta coin flip is 1/2, it is impossible to refute that the\r\n\t\t\tprobability
  of Heads is anything other than 1/2, because that\r\n\t\t\twould mean showing it
  is exactly 1/2. (It would take an infinite number of flips to reject everything
  other than 1/2.)  This argument also takes the form\r\n\t\t\tof claiming that there
  is some truth to a model until it has been shown that there is nothing to it at
  all. \r\n\t\t\tUse anecdotes and post hoc observations\r\nThis category represents
  a non-systematic presentation of special cases made in defense of (rather than as
  a test of) a particular model.   \r\nAn anecdote is an isolated, often informal
  observation made without a systematic, thorough evaluation of the available evidence.\r\nAs
  a selected observation, it is not necessarily representative of a systematic survey
  of the relevant observations.  \r\nPost hoc observations are observations made after
  the fact, often to bolster a particular model.  It is easy to select unrepresentative
  data that support almost any model.\r\n Perhaps the most subtle but useful of these
  points is the refusal\r\nto admit error. In science, models are tested precisely
  because the\r\nscientist acknowledges that every model has imperfections which may\r\nwarrant
  its abandonment. Someone who is trying to advocate a model\r\nmay want to suppress
  all doubt about its imperfections and thus\r\nsuggest that it can't be wrong. That
  attitude is a sure sign that the\r\nperson is biased. Of course, in many cases you
  will already know that\r\nthe person is biased (as with a car salesperson), and
  the best that\r\nyou can hope for is to determine how much they deviate from\r\nobjectivity.The
  template for ideal data presented earlier is a strategy for\r\nproducing data with
  a minimum of bias. But the template can be\r\napplied in many ways, and someone
  with a goal of biasing data can\r\nnonetheless adhere to this template and still
  generate biased data.\r\nLet's consider a pharmaceutical company testing the efficacy
  of a new\r\ndrug. How many ways can we imagine that the data reported from such
  a\r\nstudy might be deliberately biased, when the trials are undertaken by\r\nthe
  company that would profit from marketing the drug? The following\r\ntable lists
  a few of the possibilities.Bogus designsViolation of accepted procedureImpactChange
  design in mid-courseAn investigator may terminate an experiment prematurely if it\r\n\t\t\tis
  producing unwanted results; if the experiment is never\r\n\t\t\tcompleted, it will
  not be reported.Assay for a narrow spectrum of unlikely resultsThe public well being
  is many-faceted, and a product is\r\n\t\t\tunlikely to have a negative impact on
  more than a few facets. With\r\n\t\t\tadvance knowledge of the likely negative effects
  (e.g., a drug\r\n\t\t\tcauses brain cancer), a study can be designed to purposefully
  omit\r\n\t\t\tmeasuring those negative effects and focus on others (e.g., colon\r\n\t\t\tcancer).
  Were the subjects a fair sample of the relevant\r\n\t\t\tpopulation? The medicine
  might be more effective on some age\r\n\t\t\tgroups than others, so the study might
  be confined to the most\r\n\t\t\tresponsive age groups (determined in preliminary
  trials). While\r\n\t\t\tthe data would be accurate as reported, details of the age
  group\r\n\t\t\tmight be omitted to encourage a broader interpretation of the\r\n\t\t\tresults
  than is warranted.Protocol concealedIt is easy to write a protocol that conceals
  how the study was actually conducted in some important respects.  For example, was
  a blind design really used? Although a blind design exists\r\n\t\t\ton paper, it
  is possible to let patients and staff know which\r\n\t\t\tpatients belong to which
  groups. Indeed, patients can sometimes\r\n\t\t\tdetermine whether they are receiving
  the drug or placebo. Were the\r\n\t\t\tcontrols treated in exactly the same manner
  as the group receiving\r\n\t\t\tthe medicine? It is possible to describe countless
  ways in which\r\n\t\t\tthe control group and treatment group were treated similarly,
  yet\r\n\t\t\tto omit ways in which they were treated differently. The medicine\r\n\t\t\tmight
  be given along with some other substance that can affect\r\n\t\t\tpatient response,
  with this additional substance being omitted\r\n\t\t\tfrom the placebo.Small samplesScience
  often assumes \"innocent until proven guilty\"\r\n\t\t\tin interpreting experiments
  designed to determine if a product is\r\n\t\t\thazardous. Small samples increase
  the difficulty of demonstrating\r\n\t\t\tthat a compound is hazardous, even when
  it really is.Non-random assignmentsMost studies, especially those of humans, begin
  with enough\r\n\t\t\tvariation among subjects that random assignment to control
  or\r\n\t\t\ttreatment groups is essential to eliminate a multitude of\r\n\t\t\tconfounding
  factors. Clever non-random assignments could produce a\r\n\t\t\tstrong bias in favor
  of either outcome.Pseudo controlsThere are many dimensions to the proper establishment
  of\r\n\t\t\tcontrols, including assignment of the control groups and\r\n\t\t\tsubsequent
  treatment of the controls. It is possible to describe\r\n\t\t\tmany ways in which
  a control is treated properly while omitting\r\n\t\t\tother ways in which a control
  is treated differently. We can obviously find additional ways to bias the outcome
  of\r\ntests. Short of undertaking the study yourself, or having a neutral\r\norganization
  conduct the study, there are always ways to present a\r\nbiased model comparison
  while nonetheless being absolutely truthful\r\nabout the experimental design.Even
  when the raw data themselves were gathered with the utmost\r\ncare, there is still
  great opportunity for bias. Bias can arise as\r\neasily during data analysis, synthesis
  and interpretation, as during\r\ndata gathering. This idea is captured in the title
  of a book\r\npublished some years ago, \"How to Lie With Statistics.\" Two\r\nmethods
  of biasing evaluation are (i) throwing out some of the\r\nresults, and (ii) searching
  for a statistical test to support a\r\ndesired outcome.Throwing out results. We
  often assume that a study reports\r\nall relevant results. But studies often have
  (valid) reasons for\r\nthrowing out certain results. Throwing out results can also
  bias a\r\nstudy, however. If we flip a coin ten times, and we repeat this\r\nexperiment
  enough times, we will eventually obtain 10 heads in some\r\ntrials and ten tails
  in others. We might then report that a random\r\ncoin flip test produced ten head
  (or tails), even though the entire\r\nset of results produced an equal number of
  heads and tails - by\r\nfailing to report some results, we have biased those that
  we do\r\nreport. For example, a product test may have been repeated many\r\ntimes,
  with the ones finally published being limited to those\r\nfavoring the product.This
  principle applies widely. In a court case, the defense will\r\nonly present the
  data that they have that tends to exonerate their\r\nclient. In other cases, the
  models being tested during the evaluation\r\nand revision step of the scientific
  method are not representative of\r\nall those that could be compared. For example,
  the U.S. Forest\r\nService, when writing management plans for National Forests,
  is often\r\nrequired to compare several alternative management options. The bias\r\narises
  because the alternative options (e.g. models) that the U.S.\r\nForest Service considers
  are not always representative of all\r\npossible management options. Hence the models
  being evaluated are a\r\nbiased subset of all those conceivable.Searching for the
  \"right\" test. There are\r\nhundreds of ways to conduct statistical tests. Some
  study designs fit\r\ncleanly into standardized statistical procedures, but in many
  cases,\r\nunexpected results dictate that statistical tests be modified to suit\r\nthe
  circumstances. Thus, any one data set may have dozens to hundreds\r\nof ways of
  being analyzed. In reporting the results, someone may bias\r\nthe evaluation step
  by reporting only those tests favorable to a\r\nparticular goal. We should point
  out that this practice offers a\r\nlimited opportunity to bias an evaluation. If
  the data strongly\r\nsupport a particular result, it won't be easy to find an acceptable\r\ntest
  which obscures that result. \r\n\r\nAs noted in a previous chapter, \r\nmany evaluations
  are based on a \r\nnull\r\nmodel approach: \r\nthe null model is accepted until
  proven\r\nwrong. \r\nTo \"control\" the \r\nnull model means to \"choose\" the null
  model.  \r\nChoice of the null model can have a big effect on the outcome\r\nof
  even the most unbiased scientific evaluation for the simple reason that a null model
  is accepted until proven guilty.  Any uncertainty or inadequacy in the data will
  thus rule in favor of the null model.   By choosing the null model, therefore, many
  of the studies testing the model will \"accept\" it, not because the evidence for
  it is strong, but because the evidence against it is weak.  As a consequence, the
  null model enjoys a protected status, and it is to anyone's advantage to choose
  which model is adopted as the null model.  Choice of the null model in this sense
  does not even mean developing it or proposing/inventing it.  Given a set of alternatives
  decided upon in advance, controlling the null model means simply the selection of
  which model from that set is adopted.\r\nConsider the two alternative models that
  might be used in\r\napproving a new food additive for baby formula:a) food additives
  are considered harmful unless proven safe to\r\n\t\tsome limitb) food additives
  are considered safe unless shown to be harmful\r\n\t\t\t\tAs the null model, (a)
  requires a rigorous demonstration of the\r\nsafety of a food additive before it
  is approved. In contrast, (b)\r\nrequires that an additive can be used until a harmful
  effect is\r\ndemonstrated. As noted in the Data chapters, an enormous sample size\r\nmight
  be required to demonstrate a mild harmful effect, so a harmful\r\nproduct could
  reach market much more easily under null model (b) than\r\nunder (a). \r\nChoice
  of the null model represents a powerful yet potentially\r\nsubtle way in which an
  entire program of research can be biased.\r\nEvery other aspect of design, models
  used, and evaluation could meet\r\nacceptable standards, yet choice of a null model
  favorable to one\r\nside in a conflict will bias many outcomes in favor of that
  side.Recognizing the possible abuses of science is the simplest and\r\nmost effective
  way to avoid being subjected to them. Beyond this, we\r\ncan think of no single
  simple rule to follow that will minimize the\r\nopportunity for someone to violate
  the spirit of science and present\r\nmisleading results -- there are countless ways
  to bias data. One\r\nstrategy to avoid bias is to require detailed, explicit protocols.\r\nAnother
  is to have the data gathered by and individual or company\r\nlacking a vested interest
  in the outcome. But even with these\r\npolicies, there is no guarantee that deliberate
  biases can be weeded\r\nout. The following table gives a few pointers.Ensuring legitimate
