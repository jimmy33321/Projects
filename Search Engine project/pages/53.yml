- "\"But,\" you might say, \"none of this shakes my belief that 2 and 2 are 4.\" You
  are quite right, except in marginal cases -- and it is only in marginal cases that
  you are doubtful whether a certain animal is a dog or a certain length is less than
  a meter. Two must be two of something, and the proposition \"2 and 2 are 4\" is
  useless unless it can be applied. Two dogs and two dogs are certainly four dogs,
  but cases arise in which you are doubtful whether two of them are dogs. \"Well,
  at any rate there are four animals,\" you may say. But there are microorganisms
  concerning which it is doubtful whether they are animals or plants. \"Well, then
  living organisms,\" you say. But there are things of which it is doubtful whether
  they are living organisms or not. You will be driven into saying: \"Two entities
  and two entities are four entities.\" When you have told me what you mean by \"entity,\"
  we will resume the argument.\r\n"

- "I wanted certainty in the kind of way in which people want religious faith. I thought
  that certainty is more likely to be found in mathematics than elsewhere. But I discovered
  that many mathematical demonstrations, which my teachers expected me to accept,
  were full of fallacies, and that, if certainty were indeed discoverable in mathematics,
  it would be in a new field of mathematics, with more solid foundations than those
  that had hitherto been thought secure. But as the work proceeded, I was continually
  reminded of the fable about the elephant and the tortoise. having constructed an
  elephant upon which the mathematical world could rest, I found the elephant tottering,
  and proceeded to construct a tortoise to keep the elephant from falling. But the
  tortoise was no more secure than the elephant, and after some twenty years of very
  arduous toil, I came to the conclusion that there was nothing more that I could
  do in the way of making mathematical knowledge indubitable.Portraits from Memory.

- "Work is of two kinds: first, altering the position of matter at or near the earth's
  surface relatively to other such matter; second, telling other people to do so.
  The first kind is unpleasant and ill paid; the second is pleasant and highly paid.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "A sense of duty is useful in work but offensive in personal relations. Certain
  characteristics of the subject are clear. To begin with, we do not, in this subject,
  deal with particular things or particular properties: we deal formally with what
  can be said about \"any\" thing or \"any\" property. We are prepared to say that
  one and one are two, but not that Socrates and Plato are two, because, in our capacity
  of logicians or pure mathematicians, we have never heard of Socrates or Plato. A
  world in which there were no such individuals would still be a world in which one
  and one are two. It is not open to us, as pure mathematicians or logicians, to mention
  anything at all, because, if we do so we introduce something irrelevant and not
  formal. \r\n"

  engines of progress.Marriage and Morals.\r\n"

- "It can be shown that a mathematical web of some kind can be woven about any universe
  containing several objects. The fact that our universe lends itself to mathematical
  treatment is not a fact of any great philosophical significance.\r\n"

  1966).\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "Every living thing is a sort of imperialist, seeking to transform as much as possible

rawText: "\r\nQuotations by Bertrand Russell\r\n\r\nMathematics takes us into the
  region of absolute necessity, to which not only the actual word, but every possible
  word, must conform.\r\nQuoted in N Rose Mathematical Maxims and Minims (Raleigh
  N C 1988).\r\n\r\nAlthough this may seem a paradox, all exact science is dominated
  by the idea of approximation.\r\nQuoted in W H Auden and L Kronenberger, The Viking
  Book of Aphorisms (New York 1966).\r\n\r\nAt the age of eleven, I began Euclid,
  with my brother as my tutor. This was one of the great events of my life, as dazzling
  as first love. I had not imagined there was anything so delicious in the world.
  From that moment until I was thirty-eight, mathematics was my chief interest and
  my chief source of happiness.The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell .\r\n\r\nA good
  notation has a subtlety and suggestiveness which at times make it almost seem like
  a live teacher.\r\nQuoted in J R Newman, The World of Mathematics (New York 1956).\r\n\r\nIf
  I were a medical man, I should prescribe a holiday to any patient who considered
  his work important.The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell .\r\n\r\nOrdinary language
  is totally unsuited for expressing what physics really asserts, since the words
  of everyday life are not sufficiently abstract. Only mathematics and mathematical
  logic can say as little as the physicist means to say.The Scientific Outlook, 1931.\r\n\r\nWith
  equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to understand the hearts of
  men. I have wished to know why the stars shine. And I have tried to apprehend the
  Pythagorean power by which number holds sway about the flux. A little of this, but
  not much, I have achieved. The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell .\r\n\r\nAt first
  it seems obvious, but the more you think about it the stranger the deductions from
  this axiom seem to become; in the end you cease to understand what is meant by it.\r\nQuoted
  in N Rose Mathematical Maxims and Minims (Raleigh N C 1988).\r\n\r\nCalculus required
  continuity, and continuity was supposed to require the infinitely little; but nobody
  could discover what the infinitely little might be.\r\nQuoted in N Rose Mathematical
  Maxims and Minims (Raleigh N C 1988).\r\n\r\nThe fact that all Mathematics is Symbolic
  Logic is one of the greatest discoveries of our age; and when this fact has been
  established, the remainder of the principles of mathematics consists in the analysis
  of Symbolic Logic itself. Principles of Mathematics. 1903.\r\n\r\nA habit of basing
  convictions upon evidence, and of giving to them only that degree or certainty which
  the evidence warrants, would, if it became general, cure most of the ills from which
  the world suffers. \r\nQuoted in G Simmons Calculus Gems (New York 1992).\r\n\r\nThe
  method of \"postulating\" what we want has many advantages; they are the same as
  the advantages of theft over honest toil.Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy,
  New York and London, 1919, p 71.\r\n\r\nAristotle maintained that women have fewer
  teeth than men; although he was twice married, it never occurred to him to verify
  this statement by examining his wives' mouths.The Impact of Science on Society,
  1952.\r\n\r\n[Upon hearing via Littlewood an exposition on the theory of relativity:]\r\nTo
  think I have spent my life on absolute muck.\r\nQuoted in J E Littlewood, A Mathematician's
  Miscellany, 1953.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" you might say, \"none of this shakes my belief
  that 2 and 2 are 4.\" You are quite right, except in marginal cases -- and it is
  only in marginal cases that you are doubtful whether a certain animal is a dog or
  a certain length is less than a meter. Two must be two of something, and the proposition
  \"2 and 2 are 4\" is useless unless it can be applied. Two dogs and two dogs are
  certainly four dogs, but cases arise in which you are doubtful whether two of them
  are dogs. \"Well, at any rate there are four animals,\" you may say. But there are
  microorganisms concerning which it is doubtful whether they are animals or plants.
  \"Well, then living organisms,\" you say. But there are things of which it is doubtful
  whether they are living organisms or not. You will be driven into saying: \"Two
  entities and two entities are four entities.\" When you have told me what you mean
  by \"entity,\" we will resume the argument.\r\nQuoted in N Rose Mathematical Maxims
  and Minims (Raleigh N C 1988).\r\n\r\nI wanted certainty in the kind of way in which
  people want religious faith. I thought that certainty is more likely to be found
  in mathematics than elsewhere. But I discovered that many mathematical demonstrations,
  which my teachers expected me to accept, were full of fallacies, and that, if certainty
  were indeed discoverable in mathematics, it would be in a new field of mathematics,
  with more solid foundations than those that had hitherto been thought secure. But
  as the work proceeded, I was continually reminded of the fable about the elephant
  and the tortoise. having constructed an elephant upon which the mathematical world
  could rest, I found the elephant tottering, and proceeded to construct a tortoise
  to keep the elephant from falling. But the tortoise was no more secure than the
  elephant, and after some twenty years of very arduous toil, I came to the conclusion
  that there was nothing more that I could do in the way of making mathematical knowledge
  indubitable.Portraits from Memory. \r\n\r\nMen who are unhappy, like men who sleep
  badly, are always proud of the fact.\r\nQuoted in W H Auden and L Kronenberger,
  The Viking Book of Aphorisms (New York 1966).\r\n\r\nWork is of two kinds: first,
  altering the position of matter at or near the earth's surface relatively to other
  such matter; second, telling other people to do so. The first kind is unpleasant
  and ill paid; the second is pleasant and highly paid.\r\n\r\nA sense of duty is
  useful in work but offensive in personal relations. Certain characteristics of the
  subject are clear. To begin with, we do not, in this subject, deal with particular
  things or particular properties: we deal formally with what can be said about \"any\"
  thing or \"any\" property. We are prepared to say that one and one are two, but
  not that Socrates and Plato are two, because, in our capacity of logicians or pure
  mathematicians, we have never heard of Socrates or Plato. A world in which there
  were no such individuals would still be a world in which one and one are two. It
  is not open to us, as pure mathematicians or logicians, to mention anything at all,
  because, if we do so we introduce something irrelevant and not formal. \r\nQuoted
  in J R Newman, The World of Mathematics (New York 1956).\r\n\r\nThe desire to understand
  the world and the desire to reform it are the two great engines of progress.Marriage
  and Morals.\r\n\r\nIt can be shown that a mathematical web of some kind can be woven
  about any universe containing several objects. The fact that our universe lends
  itself to mathematical treatment is not a fact of any great philosophical significance.\r\nQuoted
  in W H Auden and L Kronenberger, The Viking Book of Aphorisms (New York 1966).\r\n\r\nEvery
  living thing is a sort of imperialist, seeking to transform as much as possible
  of its environment into itself... When we compare the (present) human population
  of the globe with... that of former times, we see that \"chemical imperialism\"
  has been... the main end to which human intelligence has been devoted.An Outline
  of Philosophy, (New York 1960) 31-32. \r\n\r\nAlmost everything that distinguishes
  the modern world from earlier centuries is attibutable to science, which achieved
  its most spectacular triumphs in the seventeenth century.History of Western Philosophy,
  (London, 1979) 512.\r\n\r\nThe whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics
  are always so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts.\r\n\r\nThe
  point of philosophy is to start with something so simple as not to seem worth stating,
  and to end with something so paradoxical that no one will believe it.\r\n\r\nBoredom
  is a vital problem for the moralist, since at least half the sins of mankind are
  caused by the fear of it.\r\nQuoted in Des MacHale, Wisdom (London, 2002).\r\n\r\nDrunkenness
  is temporary suicide: the happiness it brings is merely negative, a momentary cessation
  of unhappiness.\r\nQuoted in Des MacHale, Wisdom (London, 2002).\r\n\r\nFew people
  can be happy unless they hate some other person, nation or creed.\r\nQuoted in Des
  MacHale, Wisdom (London, 2002).\r\n\r\nNo one gossips about other people's secret
  virtues.\r\nQuoted in Des MacHale, Wisdom (London, 2002).\r\n\r\n\r\nMore quotations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOC/EFR

  my life on absolute muck.\r\nQuoted in J E Littlewood, A Mathematician's Miscellany,
  1953.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" you might say, \"none of this shakes my belief that 2 and
  2 are 4.\" You are quite right, except in marginal cases -- and it is only in marginal
  cases that you are doubtful whether a certain animal is a dog or a certain length
  is less than a meter. Two must be two of something, and the proposition \"2 and
  2 are 4\" is useless unless it can be applied. Two dogs and two dogs are certainly
  four dogs, but cases arise in which you are doubtful whether two of them are dogs.
  \"Well, at any rate there are four animals,\" you may say. But there are microorganisms
  concerning which it is doubtful whether they are animals or plants. \"Well, then
  living organisms,\" you say. But there are things of which it is doubtful whether
  they are living organisms or not. You will be driven into saying: \"Two entities
  and two entities are four entities.\" When you have told me what you mean by \"entity,\"
  we will resume the argument.\r\nQuoted in N Rose Mathematical Maxims and Minims
  (Raleigh N C 1988).\r\n\r\nI wanted certainty in the kind of way in which people
  want religious faith. I thought that certainty is more likely to be found in mathematics
  than elsewhere. But I discovered that many mathematical demonstrations, which my
  teachers expected me to accept, were full of fallacies, and that, if certainty were
  indeed discoverable in mathematics, it would be in a new field of mathematics, with
  more solid foundations than those that had hitherto been thought secure. But as
  the work proceeded, I was continually reminded of the fable about the elephant and
  the tortoise. having constructed an elephant upon which the mathematical world could
  rest, I found the elephant tottering, and proceeded to construct a tortoise to keep
  the elephant from falling. But the tortoise was no more secure than the elephant,
  and after some twenty years of very arduous toil, I came to the conclusion that
  there was nothing more that I could do in the way of making mathematical knowledge
  indubitable.Portraits from Memory. \r\n\r\nMen who are unhappy, like men who sleep
  badly, are always proud of the fact.\r\nQuoted in W H Auden and L Kronenberger,
  The Viking Book of Aphorisms (New York 1966).\r\n\r\nWork is of two kinds: first,
  altering the position of matter at or near the earth's surface relatively to other
  such matter; second, telling other people to do so. The first kind is unpleasant
  and ill paid; the second is pleasant and highly paid.\r\n\r\nA sense of duty is
  useful in work but offensive in personal relations. Certain characteristics of the
  subject are clear. To begin with, we do not, in this subject, deal with particular
  things or particular properties: we deal formally with what can be said about \"any\"
  thing or \"any\" property. We are prepared to say that one and one are two, but
  not that Socrates and Plato are two, because, in our capacity of logicians or pure
  mathematicians, we have never heard of Socrates or Plato. A world in which there
  were no such individuals would still be a world in which one and one are two. It
  is not open to us, as pure mathematicians or logicians, to mention anything at all,
  because, if we do so we introduce something irrelevant and not formal. \r\nQuoted
  in J R Newman, The World of Mathematics (New York 1956).\r\n\r\nThe desire to understand
  the world and the desire to reform it are the two great engines of progress.Marriage
  and Morals.\r\n\r\nIt can be shown that a mathematical web of some kind can be woven
  about any universe containing several objects. The fact that our universe lends
  itself to mathematical treatment is not a fact of any great philosophical significance.\r\nQuoted
  in W H Auden and L Kronenberger, The Viking Book of Aphorisms (New York 1966).\r\n\r\nEvery
  living thing is a sort of imperialist, seeking to transform as much as possible
  of its environment into itself... When we compare the (present) human population
  of the globe with... that of former times, we see that \"chemical imperialism\"
  has been... the main end to which human intelligence has been devoted.An Outline
  of Philosophy, (New York 1960) 31-32. \r\n\r\nAlmost everything that distinguishes
  the modern world from earlier centuries is attibutable to science, which achieved
  its most spectacular triumphs in the seventeenth century.History of Western Philosophy,
  (London, 1979) 512.\r\n\r\nThe whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics
  are always so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts.\r\n\r\nThe
  point of philosophy is to start with something so simple as not to seem worth stating,
  and to end with something so paradoxical that no one will believe it.\r\n\r\nBoredom
  is a vital problem for the moralist, since at least half the sins of mankind are
  caused by the fear of it.\r\nQuoted in Des MacHale, Wisdom (London, 2002).\r\n\r\nDrunkenness
  is temporary suicide: the happiness it brings is merely negative, a momentary cessation
  of unhappiness.\r\nQuoted in Des MacHale, Wisdom (London, 2002).\r\n\r\nFew people
  can be happy unless they hate some other person, nation or creed.\r\nQuoted in Des
  MacHale, Wisdom (London, 2002).\r\n\r\nNo one gossips about other people's secret
  virtues.\r\nQuoted in Des MacHale, Wisdom (London, 2002).\r\n\r\n\r\nMore quotations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
