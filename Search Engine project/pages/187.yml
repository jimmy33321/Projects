  Mathematics (from Greek μάθημα máthēma, “knowledge, study, learning”) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers),[2]structure,[3]space,[2] and change.[4][5][6] There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.[7][8]
- |
  Mathematicians seek out patterns[9][10] and use them to formulate new conjectures. Mathematicians resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity for as far back as written records exist. The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.
- |
  Rigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements. Since the pioneering work of Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932), David Hilbert (1862–1943), and others on axiomatic systems in the late 19th century, it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance, when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day.[11]

  Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) said, "The universe cannot be read until we have learned the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written. It is written in mathematical language, and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word. Without these, one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth."[12]Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences".[13]Benjamin Peirce (1809–1880) called mathematics "the science that draws necessary conclusions".[14] David Hilbert said of mathematics: "We are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense. Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules. Rather, it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise."[15]Albert Einstein (1879–1955) stated that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."[16] French mathematician Claire Voisin states "There is creative drive in mathematics, it's all about movement trying to express itself." [17]
- |
  Mathematics is essential in many fields, including natural science, engineering, medicine, finance and the social sciences. Applied mathematics has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and game theory. Mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics, or mathematics for its own sake, without having any application in mind. There is no clear line separating pure and applied mathematics, and practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered.[18]

  The history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing series of abstractions. The first abstraction, which is shared by many animals,[19] was probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges (for example) have something in common, namely quantity of their members.

  More complex mathematics did not appear until around 3000 BC, when the Babylonians and Egyptians began using arithmetic, algebra and geometry for taxation and other financial calculations, for building and construction, and for astronomy.[21] The earliest uses of mathematics were in trading, land measurement, painting and weaving patterns and the recording of time.
- |
  In Babylonian mathematics elementary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) first appears in the archaeological record. Numeracy pre-dated writing and numeral systems have been many and diverse, with the first known written numerals created by Egyptians in Middle Kingdom texts such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus.[citation needed]
- |
  Between 600 and 300 BC the Ancient Greeks began a systematic study of mathematics in its own right with Greek mathematics.[22]
- |
  Mathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and science, to the benefit of both. Mathematical discoveries continue to be made today. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January 2006 issue of the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, "The number of papers and books included in the Mathematical Reviews database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9 million, and more than 75 thousand items are added to the database each year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical theorems and their proofs."[23]

  Etymology
- |
  The word mathematics comes from the Greek μάθημα (máthēma), which, in the ancient Greek language, means "that which is learnt",[24] "what one gets to know", hence also "study" and "science", and in modern Greek just "lesson". The word máthēma is derived from μανθάνω (manthano), while the modern Greek equivalent is μαθαίνω (mathaino), both of which mean "to learn". In Greece, the word for "mathematics" came to have the narrower and more technical meaning "mathematical study" even in Classical times.[25] Its adjective is μαθηματικός (mathēmatikós), meaning "related to learning" or "studious", which likewise further came to mean "mathematical". In particular, μαθηματικὴ τέχνη (mathēmatikḗ tékhnē), Latin: ars mathematica, meant "the mathematical art".
- |
  In Latin, and in English until around 1700, the term mathematics more commonly meant "astrology" (or sometimes "astronomy") rather than "mathematics"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. This has resulted in several mistranslations: a particularly notorious one is Saint Augustine's warning that Christians should beware of mathematici meaning astrologers, which is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.[26]
- |
  The apparent plural form in English, like the French plural form les mathématiques (and the less commonly used singular derivative la mathématique), goes back to the Latin neuter plural mathematica (Cicero), based on the Greek plural τα μαθηματικά (ta mathēmatiká), used by Aristotle (384–322 BC), and meaning roughly "all things mathematical"; although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective mathematic(al) and formed the noun mathematics anew, after the pattern of physics and metaphysics, which were inherited from the Greek.[27] In English, the noun mathematics takes singular verb forms. It is often shortened to maths or, in English-speaking North America, math.[28]

  Aristotle defined mathematics as "the science of quantity", and this definition prevailed until the 18th century.[29] Starting in the 19th century, when the study of mathematics increased in rigor and began to address abstract topics such as group theory and projective geometry, which have no clear-cut relation to quantity and measurement, mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety of new definitions.[30] Some of these definitions emphasize the deductive character of much of mathematics, some emphasize its abstractness, some emphasize certain topics within mathematics. Today, no consensus on the definition of mathematics prevails, even among professionals.[7] There is not even consensus on whether mathematics is an art or a science.[8] A great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of mathematics, or consider it undefinable.[7] Some just say, "Mathematics is what mathematicians do."[7]
- |
  Three leading types of definition of mathematics are called logicist, intuitionist, and formalist, each reflecting a different philosophical school of thought.[31] All have severe problems, none has widespread acceptance, and no reconciliation seems possible.[31]
- |
  An early definition of mathematics in terms of logic was Benjamin Peirce's "the science that draws necessary conclusions" (1870).[32] In the Principia Mathematica, Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead advanced the philosophical program known as logicism, and attempted to prove that all mathematical concepts, statements, and principles can be defined and proven entirely in terms of symbolic logic. A logicist definition of mathematics is Russell's "All Mathematics is Symbolic Logic" (1903).[33]
- |
  Intuitionist definitions, developing from the philosophy of mathematician L.E.J. Brouwer, identify mathematics with certain mental phenomena. An example of an intuitionist definition is "Mathematics is the mental activity which consists in carrying out constructs one after the other."[31] A peculiarity of intuitionism is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid according to other definitions. In particular, while other philosophies of mathematics allow objects that can be proven to exist even though they cannot be constructed, intuitionism allows only mathematical objects that one can actually construct.
- |
  Formalist definitions identify mathematics with its symbols and the rules for operating on them. Haskell Curry defined mathematics simply as "the science of formal systems".[34] A formal system is a set of symbols, or tokens, and some rules telling how the tokens may be combined into formulas. In formal systems, the word axiom has a special meaning, different from the ordinary meaning of "a self-evident truth". In formal systems, an axiom is a combination of tokens that is included in a given formal system without needing to be derived using the rules of the system.

  Gauss referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences".[13] In the original Latin Regina Scientiarum, as well as in German Königin der Wissenschaften, the word corresponding to science means a "field of knowledge", and this was the original meaning of "science" in English, also; mathematics is in this sense a field of knowledge. The specialization restricting the meaning of "science" to natural science follows the rise of Baconian science, which contrasted "natural science" to scholasticism, the Aristotelean method of inquiring from first principles. The role of empirical experimentation and observation is negligible in mathematics, compared to natural sciences such as psychology, biology, or physics. Albert Einstein stated that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."[16] More recently, Marcus du Sautoy has called mathematics "the Queen of Science ... the main driving force behind scientific discovery".[35]
- |
  Many philosophers believe that mathematics is not experimentally falsifiable, and thus not a science according to the definition of Karl Popper.[36] However, in the 1930s Gödel's incompleteness theorems convinced many mathematicians[who?] that mathematics cannot be reduced to logic alone, and Karl Popper concluded that "most mathematical theories are, like those of physics and biology, hypothetico-deductive: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it seemed even recently."[37] Other thinkers, notably Imre Lakatos, have applied a version of falsificationism to mathematics itself.
- |
  An alternative view is that certain scientific fields (such as theoretical physics) are mathematics with axioms that are intended to correspond to reality. The theoretical physicist J.M. Ziman proposed that science is public knowledge, and thus includes mathematics.[38] Mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably the exploration of the logical consequences of assumptions. Intuition and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of conjectures in both mathematics and the (other) sciences. Experimental mathematics continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.
- |
  The opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians[who?] feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven liberal arts; others[who?] feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics. One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is created (as in art) or discovered (as in science). It is common to see universities divided into sections that include a division of Science and Mathematics, indicating that the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide. In practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the philosophy of mathematics.[citation needed]

  Mathematics arises from many different kinds of problems. At first these were found in commerce, land measurement, architecture and later astronomy; today, all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians, and many problems arise within mathematics itself. For example, the physicist Richard Feynman invented the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight, and today's string theory, a still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four fundamental forces of nature, continues to inspire new mathematics.[39]
- |
  Some mathematics is relevant only in the area that inspired it, and is applied to solve further problems in that area. But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts. A distinction is often made between pure mathematics and applied mathematics. However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications, e.g. number theory in cryptography. This remarkable fact, that even the "purest" mathematics often turns out to have practical applications, is what Eugene Wigner has called "the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics".[40] As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest Mathematics Subject Classification runs to 46 pages.[41] Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including statistics, operations research, and computer science.

  For those who are mathematically inclined, there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics. Many mathematicians talk about the elegance of mathematics, its intrinsic aesthetics and inner beauty. Simplicity and generality are valued. There is beauty in a simple and elegant proof, such as Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers, and in an elegant numerical method that speeds calculation, such as the fast Fourier transform. G.H. Hardy in A Mathematician's Apology expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He identified criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic.[42] Mathematicians often strive to find proofs that are particularly elegant, proofs from "The Book" of God according to Paul Erdős.[43][44] The popularity of recreational mathematics is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions.

  Most of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century.[45] Before that, mathematics was written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery.[46]Euler (1707–1783) was responsible for many of the notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. It is compressed: a few symbols contain a great deal of information. Like musical notation, modern mathematical notation has a strict syntax and encodes information that would be difficult to write in any other way.
- |
  Mathematical language can be difficult to understand for beginners. Common words such as or and only have more precise meanings than in everyday speech. Moreover, words such as open and field have specialized mathematical meanings. Technical terms such as homeomorphism and integrable have precise meanings in mathematics. Additionally, shorthand phrases such as iff for "if and only if" belong to mathematical jargon. There is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as "rigor".
- |
  Mathematical proof is fundamentally a matter of rigor. Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This is to avoid mistaken "theorems", based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject.[47] The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at the time of Isaac Newton the methods employed were less rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th century. Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics. Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about computer-assisted proofs. Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may not be sufficiently rigorous.[48]
- |
  Axioms in traditional thought were "self-evident truths", but that conception is problematic.[49] At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an axiomatic system. It was the goal of Hilbert's program to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to Gödel's incompleteness theorem every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has undecidable formulas; and so a final axiomatization of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but set theory in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.[50]

  Mathematics can, broadly speaking, be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e. arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and analysis). In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields: to logic, to set theory (foundations), to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences (applied mathematics), and more recently to the rigorous study of uncertainty. While some areas might seem unrelated, the Langlands program has found connections between areas previously thought unconnected, such as Galois groups, Riemann surfaces and number theory.
- |
  Foundations and philosophy
- |
  In order to clarify the foundations of mathematics, the fields of mathematical logic and set theory were developed. Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of logic and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies sets or collections of objects. Category theory, which deals in an abstract way with mathematical structures and relationships between them, is still in development. The phrase "crisis of foundations" describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930.[51] Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to the present day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time, including the controversy over Cantor's set theory and the Brouwer–Hilbert controversy.
- |
  Mathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous axiomatic framework, and studying the implications of such a framework. As such, it is home to Gödel's incompleteness theorems which (informally) imply that any effective formal system that contains basic arithmetic, if sound (meaning that all theorems that can be proven are true), is necessarily incomplete (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved in that system). Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation, Gödel showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical fact, but which does not follow from those axioms. Therefore, no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory. Modern logic is divided into recursion theory, model theory, and proof theory, and is closely linked to theoretical computer science,[citation needed] as well as to category theory.
- |
  Theoretical computer science includes computability theory, computational complexity theory, and information theory. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most well-known model – the Turing machine. Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware. A famous problem is the "P = NP?" problem, one of the Millennium Prize Problems.[52] Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as compression and entropy.

  Quantity
- |
  The study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar natural numbers and integers ("whole numbers") and arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in arithmetic. The deeper properties of integers are studied in number theory, from which come such popular results as Fermat's Last Theorem. The twin prime conjecture and Goldbach's conjecture are two unsolved problems in number theory.
- |
  As the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a subset of the rational numbers ("fractions"). These, in turn, are contained within the real numbers, which are used to represent continuous quantities. Real numbers are generalized to complex numbers. These are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include quaternions and octonions. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the transfinite numbers, which formalize the concept of "infinity". Another area of study is size, which leads to the cardinal numbers and then to another conception of infinity: the aleph numbers, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.

  Structure
- |
  Many mathematical objects, such as sets of numbers and functions, exhibit internal structure as a consequence of operations or relations that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance number theory studies properties of the set of integers that can be expressed in terms of arithmetic operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or structures) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of abstraction, to state axioms for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study groups, rings, fields and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of abstract algebra.
- |
  By its great generality, abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning compass and straightedge constructions were finally solved using Galois theory, which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic theory is linear algebra, which is the general study of vector spaces, whose elements called vectors have both quantity and direction, and can be used to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of geometry and algebra have very strong interactions in modern mathematics. Combinatorics studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.

  The study of space originates with geometry – in particular, Euclidean geometry. Trigonometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions; it combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known Pythagorean theorem. The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, non-Euclidean geometries (which play a central role in general relativity) and topology. Quantity and space both play a role in analytic geometry, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry. Convex and discrete geometry were developed to solve problems in number theory and functional analysis but now are pursued with an eye on applications in optimization and computer science. Within differential geometry are the concepts of fiber bundles and calculus on manifolds, in particular, vector and tensor calculus. Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of polynomial equations, combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of topological groups, which combine structure and space. Lie groups are used to study space, structure, and change. Topology in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in 20th-century mathematics; it includes point-set topology, set-theoretic topology, algebraic topology and differential topology. In particular, instances of modern-day topology are metrizability theory, axiomatic set theory, homotopy theory, and Morse theory. Topology also includes the now solved Poincaré conjecture, and the still unsolved areas of the Hodge conjecture. Other results in geometry and topology, including the four color theorem and Kepler conjecture, have been proved only with the help of computers.

  Change
- |
  Understanding and describing change is a common theme in the natural sciences, and calculus was developed as a powerful tool to investigate it. Functions arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of real numbers and functions of a real variable is known as real analysis, with complex analysis the equivalent field for the complex numbers. Functional analysis focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) spaces of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is quantum mechanics. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as differential equations. Many phenomena in nature can be described by dynamical systems; chaos theory makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still deterministic behavior.

  Applied mathematics
- |
  Applied mathematics concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry. Thus, "applied mathematics" is a mathematical science with specialized knowledge. The term applied mathematics also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, applied mathematics focuses on the "formulation, study, and use of mathematical models" in science, engineering, and other areas of mathematical practice.
- |
  In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in pure mathematics.
- |
  Statistics and other decision sciences
- |
  Applied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of statistics, whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with probability theory. Statisticians (working as part of a research project) "create data that makes sense" with random sampling and with randomized experiments;[53] the design of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before the data be available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or when analyzing data from observational studies, statisticians "make sense of the data" using the art of modelling and the theory of inference – with model selection and estimation; the estimated models and consequential predictions should be tested on new data.[54]
- |
  Statistical theory studies decision problems such as minimizing the risk (expected loss) of a statistical action, such as using a procedure in, for example, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and selecting the best. In these traditional areas of mathematical statistics, a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an objective function, like expected loss or cost, under specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence.[55] Because of its use of optimization, the mathematical theory of statistics shares concerns with other decision sciences, such as operations research, control theory, and mathematical economics.[56]
- |
  Computational mathematics
- |
  Computational mathematics proposes and studies methods for solving mathematical problems that are typically too large for human numerical capacity. Numerical analysis studies methods for problems in analysis using functional analysis and approximation theory; numerical analysis includes the study of approximation and discretization broadly with special concern for rounding errors. Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially algorithmic matrix and graph theory. Other areas of computational mathematics include computer algebra and symbolic computation.

  Mathematical awards
- |
  Arguably the most prestigious award in mathematics is the Fields Medal,[57][58] established in 1936 and now awarded every four years. The Fields Medal is often considered a mathematical equivalent to the Nobel Prize.
- |
  The Wolf Prize in Mathematics, instituted in 1978, recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the Abel Prize, was introduced in 2003. The Chern Medal was introduced in 2010 to recognize lifetime achievement. These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular body of work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an outstanding problem in an established field.
- |
  A famous list of 23 open problems, called "Hilbert's problems", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician David Hilbert. This list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the "Millennium Prize Problems", was published in 2000. A solution to each of these problems carries a $1 million reward, and only one (the Riemann hypothesis) is duplicated in Hilbert's problems.

- '} );Mathematics (from Greek μάθημα máthēma, “knowledge, study, learning”) is the
  study of topics such as quantity (numbers),[2]structure,[3]space,[2] and change.[4][5][6]
  There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact
  scope and definition of mathematics.[7][8]Mathematicians seek out patterns[9][10]
  and use them to formulate new conjectures. Mathematicians resolve the truth or falsity
  of conjectures by mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models
  of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions
  about nature. Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from
  counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions
  of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity for as far
  back as written records exist. The research required to solve mathematical problems
  can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.Rigorous arguments first appeared
  in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid''s Elements. Since the pioneering work
  of Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932), David Hilbert (1862–1943), and others on axiomatic
  systems in the late 19th century, it has become customary to view mathematical research
  as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and
  definitions. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance,
  when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to
  a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the
  present day.[11]Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) said, "The universe cannot be read until
  we have learned the language and become familiar with the characters in which it
  is written. It is written in mathematical language, and the letters are triangles,
  circles and other geometrical figures, without which means it is humanly impossible
  to comprehend a single word. Without these, one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth."[12]Carl
  Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences".[13]Benjamin
  Peirce (1809–1880) called mathematics "the science that draws necessary conclusions".[14]
  David Hilbert said of mathematics: "We are not speaking here of arbitrariness in
  any sense. Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily
  stipulated rules. Rather, it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity
  that can only be so and by no means otherwise."[15]Albert Einstein (1879–1955) stated
  that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain;
  and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."[16] French mathematician
  Claire Voisin states "There is creative drive in mathematics, it''s all about movement
  trying to express itself." [17]Mathematics is essential in many fields, including
  natural science, engineering, medicine, finance and the social sciences. Applied
  mathematics has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics
  and game theory. Mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics, or mathematics
  for its own sake, without having any application in mind. There is no clear line
  separating pure and applied mathematics, and practical applications for what began
  as pure mathematics are often discovered.[18]The history of mathematics can be seen
  as an ever-increasing series of abstractions. The first abstraction, which is shared
  by many animals,[19] was probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection
  of two apples and a collection of two oranges (for example) have something in common,
  namely quantity of their members.As evidenced by tallies found on bone, in addition
  to recognizing how to count physical objects, prehistoric peoples may have also
  recognized how to count abstract quantities, like time – days, seasons, years.[20]More
  complex mathematics did not appear until around 3000 BC, when the Babylonians and
  Egyptians began using arithmetic, algebra and geometry for taxation and other financial
  calculations, for building and construction, and for astronomy.[21] The earliest
  uses of mathematics were in trading, land measurement, painting and weaving patterns
  and the recording of time.In Babylonian mathematics elementary arithmetic (addition,
  subtraction, multiplication and division) first appears in the archaeological record.
  Numeracy pre-dated writing and numeral systems have been many and diverse, with
  the first known written numerals created by Egyptians in Middle Kingdom texts such
  as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus.[citation needed]Between 600 and 300 BC the Ancient
  Greeks began a systematic study of mathematics in its own right with Greek mathematics.[22]Mathematics
  has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between
  mathematics and science, to the benefit of both. Mathematical discoveries continue
  to be made today. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January 2006 issue of
  the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, "The number of papers and books
  included in the Mathematical Reviews database since 1940 (the first year of operation
  of MR) is now more than 1.9 million, and more than 75 thousand items are added to
  the database each year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain
  new mathematical theorems and their proofs."[23]The word mathematics comes from
  the Greek μάθημα (máthēma), which, in the ancient Greek language, means "that which
  is learnt",[24] "what one gets to know", hence also "study" and "science", and in
  modern Greek just "lesson". The word máthēma is derived from μανθάνω (manthano),
  while the modern Greek equivalent is μαθαίνω (mathaino), both of which mean "to
  learn". In Greece, the word for "mathematics" came to have the narrower and more
  technical meaning "mathematical study" even in Classical times.[25] Its adjective
  is μαθηματικός (mathēmatikós), meaning "related to learning" or "studious", which
  likewise further came to mean "mathematical". In particular, μαθηματικὴ τέχνη (mathēmatikḗ
  tékhnē), Latin: ars mathematica, meant "the mathematical art".In Latin, and in English
  until around 1700, the term mathematics more commonly meant "astrology" (or sometimes
  "astronomy") rather than "mathematics"; the meaning gradually changed to its present
  one from about 1500 to 1800. This has resulted in several mistranslations: a particularly
  notorious one is Saint Augustine''s warning that Christians should beware of mathematici
  meaning astrologers, which is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.[26]The
  apparent plural form in English, like the French plural form les mathématiques (and
  the less commonly used singular derivative la mathématique), goes back to the Latin
  neuter plural mathematica (Cicero), based on the Greek plural τα μαθηματικά (ta
  mathēmatiká), used by Aristotle (384–322 BC), and meaning roughly "all things mathematical";
  although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective mathematic(al)
  and formed the noun mathematics anew, after the pattern of physics and metaphysics,
  which were inherited from the Greek.[27] In English, the noun mathematics takes
  singular verb forms. It is often shortened to maths or, in English-speaking North
  America, math.[28]Aristotle defined mathematics as "the science of quantity", and
  this definition prevailed until the 18th century.[29] Starting in the 19th century,
  when the study of mathematics increased in rigor and began to address abstract topics
  such as group theory and projective geometry, which have no clear-cut relation to
  quantity and measurement, mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety
  of new definitions.[30] Some of these definitions emphasize the deductive character
  of much of mathematics, some emphasize its abstractness, some emphasize certain
  topics within mathematics. Today, no consensus on the definition of mathematics
  prevails, even among professionals.[7] There is not even consensus on whether mathematics
  is an art or a science.[8] A great many professional mathematicians take no interest
  in a definition of mathematics, or consider it undefinable.[7] Some just say, "Mathematics
  is what mathematicians do."[7]Three leading types of definition of mathematics are
  called logicist, intuitionist, and formalist, each reflecting a different philosophical
  school of thought.[31] All have severe problems, none has widespread acceptance,
  and no reconciliation seems possible.[31]An early definition of mathematics in terms
  of logic was Benjamin Peirce''s "the science that draws necessary conclusions" (1870).[32]
  In the Principia Mathematica, Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead advanced
  the philosophical program known as logicism, and attempted to prove that all mathematical
  concepts, statements, and principles can be defined and proven entirely in terms
  of symbolic logic. A logicist definition of mathematics is Russell''s "All Mathematics
  is Symbolic Logic" (1903).[33]Intuitionist definitions, developing from the philosophy
  of mathematician L.E.J. Brouwer, identify mathematics with certain mental phenomena.
  An example of an intuitionist definition is "Mathematics is the mental activity
  which consists in carrying out constructs one after the other."[31] A peculiarity
  of intuitionism is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid according
  to other definitions. In particular, while other philosophies of mathematics allow
  objects that can be proven to exist even though they cannot be constructed, intuitionism
  allows only mathematical objects that one can actually construct.Formalist definitions
  identify mathematics with its symbols and the rules for operating on them. Haskell
  Curry defined mathematics simply as "the science of formal systems".[34] A formal
  system is a set of symbols, or tokens, and some rules telling how the tokens may
  be combined into formulas. In formal systems, the word axiom has a special meaning,
  different from the ordinary meaning of "a self-evident truth". In formal systems,
  an axiom is a combination of tokens that is included in a given formal system without
  needing to be derived using the rules of the system.Gauss referred to mathematics
  as "the Queen of the Sciences".[13] In the original Latin Regina Scientiarum, as
  well as in German Königin der Wissenschaften, the word corresponding to science
  means a "field of knowledge", and this was the original meaning of "science" in
  English, also; mathematics is in this sense a field of knowledge. The specialization
  restricting the meaning of "science" to natural science follows the rise of Baconian
  science, which contrasted "natural science" to scholasticism, the Aristotelean method
  of inquiring from first principles. The role of empirical experimentation and observation
  is negligible in mathematics, compared to natural sciences such as psychology, biology,
  or physics. Albert Einstein stated that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer
  to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer
  to reality."[16] More recently, Marcus du Sautoy has called mathematics "the Queen
  of Science ... the main driving force behind scientific discovery".[35]Many philosophers
  believe that mathematics is not experimentally falsifiable, and thus not a science
  according to the definition of Karl Popper.[36] However, in the 1930s Gödel''s incompleteness
  theorems convinced many mathematicians[who?] that mathematics cannot be reduced
  to logic alone, and Karl Popper concluded that "most mathematical theories are,
  like those of physics and biology, hypothetico-deductive: pure mathematics therefore
  turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures,
  than it seemed even recently."[37] Other thinkers, notably Imre Lakatos, have applied
  a version of falsificationism to mathematics itself.An alternative view is that
  certain scientific fields (such as theoretical physics) are mathematics with axioms
  that are intended to correspond to reality. The theoretical physicist J.M. Ziman
  proposed that science is public knowledge, and thus includes mathematics.[38] Mathematics
  shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably the exploration
  of the logical consequences of assumptions. Intuition and experimentation also play
  a role in the formulation of conjectures in both mathematics and the (other) sciences.
  Experimental mathematics continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and
  computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and
  mathematics.The opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians[who?]
  feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic
  side, and its history in the traditional seven liberal arts; others[who?] feel that
  to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that
  the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering
  has driven much development in mathematics. One way this difference of viewpoint
  plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is created (as
  in art) or discovered (as in science). It is common to see universities divided
  into sections that include a division of Science and Mathematics, indicating that
  the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide. In practice,
  mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated
  at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the philosophy of mathematics.[citation
  needed]Mathematics arises from many different kinds of problems. At first these
  were found in commerce, land measurement, architecture and later astronomy; today,
  all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians, and many problems arise
  within mathematics itself. For example, the physicist Richard Feynman invented the
  path integral formulation of quantum mechanics using a combination of mathematical
  reasoning and physical insight, and today''s string theory, a still-developing scientific
  theory which attempts to unify the four fundamental forces of nature, continues
  to inspire new mathematics.[39]Some mathematics is relevant only in the area that
  inspired it, and is applied to solve further problems in that area. But often mathematics
  inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of
  mathematical concepts. A distinction is often made between pure mathematics and
  applied mathematics. However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications,
  e.g. number theory in cryptography. This remarkable fact, that even the "purest"
  mathematics often turns out to have practical applications, is what Eugene Wigner
  has called "the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics".[40] As in most areas
  of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization:
  there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest Mathematics
  Subject Classification runs to 46 pages.[41] Several areas of applied mathematics
  have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines
  in their own right, including statistics, operations research, and computer science.For
  those who are mathematically inclined, there is often a definite aesthetic aspect
  to much of mathematics. Many mathematicians talk about the elegance of mathematics,
  its intrinsic aesthetics and inner beauty. Simplicity and generality are valued.
  There is beauty in a simple and elegant proof, such as Euclid''s proof that there
  are infinitely many prime numbers, and in an elegant numerical method that speeds
  calculation, such as the fast Fourier transform. G.H. Hardy in A Mathematician''s
  Apology expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves,
  sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He identified criteria such
  as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors that contribute
  to a mathematical aesthetic.[42] Mathematicians often strive to find proofs that
  are particularly elegant, proofs from "The Book" of God according to Paul Erdős.[43][44]
  The popularity of recreational mathematics is another sign of the pleasure many
  find in solving mathematical questions.Most of the mathematical notation in use
  today was not invented until the 16th century.[45] Before that, mathematics was
  written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery.[46]Euler (1707–1783) was
  responsible for many of the notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics
  much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. It is compressed:
  a few symbols contain a great deal of information. Like musical notation, modern
  mathematical notation has a strict syntax and encodes information that would be
  difficult to write in any other way.Mathematical language can be difficult to understand
  for beginners. Common words such as or and only have more precise meanings than
  in everyday speech. Moreover, words such as open and field have specialized mathematical
  meanings. Technical terms such as homeomorphism and integrable have precise meanings
  in mathematics. Additionally, shorthand phrases such as iff for "if and only if"
  belong to mathematical jargon. There is a reason for special notation and technical
  vocabulary: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians
  refer to this precision of language and logic as "rigor".Mathematical proof is fundamentally
  a matter of rigor. Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means
  of systematic reasoning. This is to avoid mistaken "theorems", based on fallible
  intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject.[47]
  The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected
  detailed arguments, but at the time of Isaac Newton the methods employed were less
  rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence
  of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th century. Misunderstanding the rigor
  is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics. Today, mathematicians
  continue to argue among themselves about computer-assisted proofs. Since large computations
  are hard to verify, such proofs may not be sufficiently rigorous.[48]Axioms in traditional
  thought were "self-evident truths", but that conception is problematic.[49] At a
  formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning
  only in the context of all derivable formulas of an axiomatic system. It was the
  goal of Hilbert''s program to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis,
  but according to Gödel''s incompleteness theorem every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic
  system has undecidable formulas; and so a final axiomatization of mathematics is
  impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal
  content) nothing but set theory in some axiomatization, in the sense that every
  mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.[50]Mathematics
  can, broadly speaking, be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space,
  and change (i.e. arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and analysis). In addition to these
  main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the
  heart of mathematics to other fields: to logic, to set theory (foundations), to
  the empirical mathematics of the various sciences (applied mathematics), and more
  recently to the rigorous study of uncertainty. While some areas might seem unrelated,
  the Langlands program has found connections between areas previously thought unconnected,
  such as Galois groups, Riemann surfaces and number theory.In order to clarify the
  foundations of mathematics, the fields of mathematical logic and set theory were
  developed. Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of logic and the applications
  of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics
  that studies sets or collections of objects. Category theory, which deals in an
  abstract way with mathematical structures and relationships between them, is still
  in development. The phrase "crisis of foundations" describes the search for a rigorous
  foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930.[51]
  Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to the present
  day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the
  time, including the controversy over Cantor''s set theory and the Brouwer–Hilbert
  controversy.Mathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous
  axiomatic framework, and studying the implications of such a framework. As such,
  it is home to Gödel''s incompleteness theorems which (informally) imply that any
  effective formal system that contains basic arithmetic, if sound (meaning that all
  theorems that can be proven are true), is necessarily incomplete (meaning that there
  are true theorems which cannot be proved in that system). Whatever finite collection
  of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation, Gödel showed how to construct
  a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical fact, but which does not follow
  from those axioms. Therefore, no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full
  number theory. Modern logic is divided into recursion theory, model theory, and
  proof theory, and is closely linked to theoretical computer science,[citation needed]
  as well as to category theory.Theoretical computer science includes computability
  theory, computational complexity theory, and information theory. Computability theory
  examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including
  the most well-known model – the Turing machine. Complexity theory is the study of
  tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by computer,
  are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain
  practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware. A
  famous problem is the "P = NP?" problem, one of the Millennium Prize Problems.[52]
  Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored
  on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as compression and entropy.The
  study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar natural numbers and integers
  ("whole numbers") and arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in
  arithmetic. The deeper properties of integers are studied in number theory, from
  which come such popular results as Fermat''s Last Theorem. The twin prime conjecture
  and Goldbach''s conjecture are two unsolved problems in number theory.As the number
  system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a subset of the rational
  numbers ("fractions"). These, in turn, are contained within the real numbers, which
  are used to represent continuous quantities. Real numbers are generalized to complex
  numbers. These are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include
  quaternions and octonions. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the
  transfinite numbers, which formalize the concept of "infinity". Another area of
  study is size, which leads to the cardinal numbers and then to another conception
  of infinity: the aleph numbers, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of
  infinitely large sets.Many mathematical objects, such as sets of numbers and functions,
  exhibit internal structure as a consequence of operations or relations that are
  defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be
  expressed in terms of that structure; for instance number theory studies properties
  of the set of integers that can be expressed in terms of arithmetic operations.
  Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or structures)
  exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of abstraction,
  to state axioms for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class
  of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study groups, rings, fields
  and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic
  operations) constitute the domain of abstract algebra.By its great generality, abstract
  algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number
  of ancient problems concerning compass and straightedge constructions were finally
  solved using Galois theory, which involves field theory and group theory. Another
  example of an algebraic theory is linear algebra, which is the general study of
  vector spaces, whose elements called vectors have both quantity and direction, and
  can be used to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of
  the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of geometry and algebra have
  very strong interactions in modern mathematics. Combinatorics studies ways of enumerating
  the number of objects that fit a given structure.The study of space originates with
  geometry – in particular, Euclidean geometry. Trigonometry is the branch of mathematics
  that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and
  with the trigonometric functions; it combines space and numbers, and encompasses
  the well-known Pythagorean theorem. The modern study of space generalizes these
  ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, non-Euclidean geometries (which play
  a central role in general relativity) and topology. Quantity and space both play
  a role in analytic geometry, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry. Convex
  and discrete geometry were developed to solve problems in number theory and functional
  analysis but now are pursued with an eye on applications in optimization and computer
  science. Within differential geometry are the concepts of fiber bundles and calculus
  on manifolds, in particular, vector and tensor calculus. Within algebraic geometry
  is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of polynomial equations,
  combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of topological
  groups, which combine structure and space. Lie groups are used to study space, structure,
  and change. Topology in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth
  area in 20th-century mathematics; it includes point-set topology, set-theoretic
  topology, algebraic topology and differential topology. In particular, instances
  of modern-day topology are metrizability theory, axiomatic set theory, homotopy
  theory, and Morse theory. Topology also includes the now solved Poincaré conjecture,
  and the still unsolved areas of the Hodge conjecture. Other results in geometry
  and topology, including the four color theorem and Kepler conjecture, have been
  proved only with the help of computers.Understanding and describing change is a
  common theme in the natural sciences, and calculus was developed as a powerful tool
  to investigate it. Functions arise here, as a central concept describing a changing
  quantity. The rigorous study of real numbers and functions of a real variable is
  known as real analysis, with complex analysis the equivalent field for the complex
  numbers. Functional analysis focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional)
  spaces of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is quantum
  mechanics. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and
  its rate of change, and these are studied as differential equations. Many phenomena
  in nature can be described by dynamical systems; chaos theory makes precise the
  ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still deterministic
  behavior.Applied mathematics concerns itself with mathematical methods that are
  typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry. Thus, "applied mathematics"
  is a mathematical science with specialized knowledge. The term applied mathematics
  also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical
  problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, applied mathematics focuses
  on the "formulation, study, and use of mathematical models" in science, engineering,
  and other areas of mathematical practice.In the past, practical applications have
  motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject
  of study in pure mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own
  sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research
  in pure mathematics.Applied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline
  of statistics, whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with probability
  theory. Statisticians (working as part of a research project) "create data that
  makes sense" with random sampling and with randomized experiments;[53] the design
  of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before
  the data be available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or
  when analyzing data from observational studies, statisticians "make sense of the
  data" using the art of modelling and the theory of inference – with model selection
  and estimation; the estimated models and consequential predictions should be tested
  on new data.[54]Statistical theory studies decision problems such as minimizing
  the risk (expected loss) of a statistical action, such as using a procedure in,
  for example, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and selecting the best. In
  these traditional areas of mathematical statistics, a statistical-decision problem
  is formulated by minimizing an objective function, like expected loss or cost, under
  specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing
  the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence.[55] Because
  of its use of optimization, the mathematical theory of statistics shares concerns
  with other decision sciences, such as operations research, control theory, and mathematical
  economics.[56]Computational mathematics proposes and studies methods for solving
  mathematical problems that are typically too large for human numerical capacity.
  Numerical analysis studies methods for problems in analysis using functional analysis
  and approximation theory; numerical analysis includes the study of approximation
  and discretization broadly with special concern for rounding errors. Numerical analysis
  and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical
  science, especially algorithmic matrix and graph theory. Other areas of computational
  mathematics include computer algebra and symbolic computation.Arguably the most
  prestigious award in mathematics is the Fields Medal,[57][58] established in 1936
  and now awarded every four years. The Fields Medal is often considered a mathematical
  equivalent to the Nobel Prize.The Wolf Prize in Mathematics, instituted in 1978,
  recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the Abel
  Prize, was introduced in 2003. The Chern Medal was introduced in 2010 to recognize
  lifetime achievement. These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular
  body of work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an outstanding
  problem in an established field.A famous list of 23 open problems, called "Hilbert''s
  problems", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician David Hilbert. This list
  achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems
  have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the "Millennium
  Prize Problems", was published in 2000. A solution to each of these problems carries
  a $1 million reward, and only one (the Riemann hypothesis) is duplicated in Hilbert''s
  problems.'

  see Math (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\nEuclid (holding calipers), Greek mathematician,
  3rd century BC, as imagined by Raphael in this detail from The School of Athens.[1]\n\n\nMathematics
  (from Greek μάθημα máthēma, “knowledge, study, learning”) is the study of topics
  such as quantity (numbers),[2]structure,[3]space,[2] and change.[4][5][6] There
  is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope
  and definition of mathematics.[7][8]\nMathematicians seek out patterns[9][10] and
  use them to formulate new conjectures. Mathematicians resolve the truth or falsity
  of conjectures by mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models
  of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions
  about nature. Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from
  counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions
  of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity for as far
  back as written records exist. The research required to solve mathematical problems
  can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.\nRigorous arguments first
  appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements. Since the pioneering
  work of Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932), David Hilbert (1862–1943), and others on axiomatic
  systems in the late 19th century, it has become customary to view mathematical research
  as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and
  definitions. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance,
  when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to
  a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the
  present day.[11]\nGalileo Galilei (1564–1642) said, \"The universe cannot be read
  until we have learned the language and become familiar with the characters in which
  it is written. It is written in mathematical language, and the letters are triangles,
  circles and other geometrical figures, without which means it is humanly impossible
  to comprehend a single word. Without these, one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth.\"[12]Carl
  Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) referred to mathematics as \"the Queen of the Sciences\".[13]Benjamin
  Peirce (1809–1880) called mathematics \"the science that draws necessary conclusions\".[14]
  David Hilbert said of mathematics: \"We are not speaking here of arbitrariness in
  any sense. Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily
  stipulated rules. Rather, it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity
  that can only be so and by no means otherwise.\"[15]Albert Einstein (1879–1955)
  stated that \"as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain;
  and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.\"[16] French mathematician
  Claire Voisin states \"There is creative drive in mathematics, it's all about movement
  trying to express itself.\" [17]\nMathematics is essential in many fields, including
  natural science, engineering, medicine, finance and the social sciences. Applied
  mathematics has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics
  and game theory. Mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics, or mathematics
  for its own sake, without having any application in mind. There is no clear line
  separating pure and applied mathematics, and practical applications for what began
  as pure mathematics are often discovered.[18]\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n1.1

  article: History of mathematics\nThe history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing
  series of abstractions. The first abstraction, which is shared by many animals,[19]
  was probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection of two apples and
  a collection of two oranges (for example) have something in common, namely quantity
  of their members.\n\n\n\n\nGreek mathematician Pythagoras (c. 570 – c. 495 BC),
  commonly credited with discovering the Pythagorean theorem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMayan numerals\n\n\nAs
  evidenced by tallies found on bone, in addition to recognizing how to count physical
  objects, prehistoric peoples may have also recognized how to count abstract quantities,
  like time – days, seasons, years.[20]\nMore complex mathematics did not appear until
  around 3000 BC, when the Babylonians and Egyptians began using arithmetic, algebra
  and geometry for taxation and other financial calculations, for building and construction,
  and for astronomy.[21] The earliest uses of mathematics were in trading, land measurement,
  painting and weaving patterns and the recording of time.\nIn Babylonian mathematics
  elementary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) first
  appears in the archaeological record. Numeracy pre-dated writing and numeral systems
  have been many and diverse, with the first known written numerals created by Egyptians
  in Middle Kingdom texts such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus.[citation needed]\nBetween
  600 and 300 BC the Ancient Greeks began a systematic study of mathematics in its
  own right with Greek mathematics.[22]\nMathematics has since been greatly extended,
  and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and science, to the
  benefit of both. Mathematical discoveries continue to be made today. According to
  Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January 2006 issue of the Bulletin of the American Mathematical
  Society, \"The number of papers and books included in the Mathematical Reviews database
  since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9 million, and
  more than 75 thousand items are added to the database each year. The overwhelming
  majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical theorems and their proofs.\"[23]\nEtymology\nThe
  word mathematics comes from the Greek μάθημα (máthēma), which, in the ancient Greek
  language, means \"that which is learnt\",[24] \"what one gets to know\", hence also
  \"study\" and \"science\", and in modern Greek just \"lesson\". The word máthēma
  is derived from μανθάνω (manthano), while the modern Greek equivalent is μαθαίνω
  (mathaino), both of which mean \"to learn\". In Greece, the word for \"mathematics\"
  came to have the narrower and more technical meaning \"mathematical study\" even
  in Classical times.[25] Its adjective is μαθηματικός (mathēmatikós), meaning \"related
  to learning\" or \"studious\", which likewise further came to mean \"mathematical\".
  In particular, μαθηματικὴ τέχνη (mathēmatikḗ tékhnē), Latin: ars mathematica, meant
  \"the mathematical art\".\nIn Latin, and in English until around 1700, the term
  mathematics more commonly meant \"astrology\" (or sometimes \"astronomy\") rather
  than \"mathematics\"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about
  1500 to 1800. This has resulted in several mistranslations: a particularly notorious
  one is Saint Augustine's warning that Christians should beware of mathematici meaning
  astrologers, which is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.[26]\nThe
  apparent plural form in English, like the French plural form les mathématiques (and
  the less commonly used singular derivative la mathématique), goes back to the Latin
  neuter plural mathematica (Cicero), based on the Greek plural τα μαθηματικά (ta
  mathēmatiká), used by Aristotle (384–322 BC), and meaning roughly \"all things mathematical\";
  although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective mathematic(al)
  and formed the noun mathematics anew, after the pattern of physics and metaphysics,
  which were inherited from the Greek.[27] In English, the noun mathematics takes
  singular verb forms. It is often shortened to maths or, in English-speaking North
  America, math.[28]\nDefinitions of mathematics\nMain article: Definitions of mathematics\n\n\n\n\nLeonardo
  Fibonacci, the Italian mathematician who established the Hindu–Arabic numeral system
  to the Western World\n\n\nAristotle defined mathematics as \"the science of quantity\",
  and this definition prevailed until the 18th century.[29] Starting in the 19th century,
  when the study of mathematics increased in rigor and began to address abstract topics
  such as group theory and projective geometry, which have no clear-cut relation to
  quantity and measurement, mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety
  of new definitions.[30] Some of these definitions emphasize the deductive character
  of much of mathematics, some emphasize its abstractness, some emphasize certain
  topics within mathematics. Today, no consensus on the definition of mathematics
  prevails, even among professionals.[7] There is not even consensus on whether mathematics
  is an art or a science.[8] A great many professional mathematicians take no interest
  in a definition of mathematics, or consider it undefinable.[7] Some just say, \"Mathematics
  is what mathematicians do.\"[7]\nThree leading types of definition of mathematics
  are called logicist, intuitionist, and formalist, each reflecting a different philosophical
  school of thought.[31] All have severe problems, none has widespread acceptance,
  and no reconciliation seems possible.[31]\nAn early definition of mathematics in
  terms of logic was Benjamin Peirce's \"the science that draws necessary conclusions\"
  (1870).[32] In the Principia Mathematica, Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead
  advanced the philosophical program known as logicism, and attempted to prove that
  all mathematical concepts, statements, and principles can be defined and proven
  entirely in terms of symbolic logic. A logicist definition of mathematics is Russell's
  \"All Mathematics is Symbolic Logic\" (1903).[33]\nIntuitionist definitions, developing
  from the philosophy of mathematician L.E.J. Brouwer, identify mathematics with certain
  mental phenomena. An example of an intuitionist definition is \"Mathematics is the
  mental activity which consists in carrying out constructs one after the other.\"[31]
  A peculiarity of intuitionism is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered
  valid according to other definitions. In particular, while other philosophies of
  mathematics allow objects that can be proven to exist even though they cannot be
  constructed, intuitionism allows only mathematical objects that one can actually
  construct.\nFormalist definitions identify mathematics with its symbols and the
  rules for operating on them. Haskell Curry defined mathematics simply as \"the science
  of formal systems\".[34] A formal system is a set of symbols, or tokens, and some
  rules telling how the tokens may be combined into formulas. In formal systems, the
  word axiom has a special meaning, different from the ordinary meaning of \"a self-evident
  truth\". In formal systems, an axiom is a combination of tokens that is included
  in a given formal system without needing to be derived using the rules of the system.\nMathematics
  as science\n\n\n\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss, known as the prince of mathematicians\n\n\nGauss
  referred to mathematics as \"the Queen of the Sciences\".[13] In the original Latin
  Regina Scientiarum, as well as in German Königin der Wissenschaften, the word corresponding
  to science means a \"field of knowledge\", and this was the original meaning of
  \"science\" in English, also; mathematics is in this sense a field of knowledge.
  The specialization restricting the meaning of \"science\" to natural science follows
  the rise of Baconian science, which contrasted \"natural science\" to scholasticism,
  the Aristotelean method of inquiring from first principles. The role of empirical
  experimentation and observation is negligible in mathematics, compared to natural
  sciences such as psychology, biology, or physics. Albert Einstein stated that \"as
  far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far
  as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.\"[16] More recently, Marcus du
  Sautoy has called mathematics \"the Queen of Science ... the main driving force
  behind scientific discovery\".[35]\nMany philosophers believe that mathematics is
  not experimentally falsifiable, and thus not a science according to the definition
  of Karl Popper.[36] However, in the 1930s Gödel's incompleteness theorems convinced
  many mathematicians[who?] that mathematics cannot be reduced to logic alone, and
  Karl Popper concluded that \"most mathematical theories are, like those of physics
  and biology, hypothetico-deductive: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much
  closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it seemed
  even recently.\"[37] Other thinkers, notably Imre Lakatos, have applied a version
  of falsificationism to mathematics itself.\nAn alternative view is that certain
  scientific fields (such as theoretical physics) are mathematics with axioms that
  are intended to correspond to reality. The theoretical physicist J.M. Ziman proposed
  that science is public knowledge, and thus includes mathematics.[38] Mathematics
  shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably the exploration
  of the logical consequences of assumptions. Intuition and experimentation also play
  a role in the formulation of conjectures in both mathematics and the (other) sciences.
  Experimental mathematics continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and
  computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and
  mathematics.\nThe opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians[who?]
  feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic
  side, and its history in the traditional seven liberal arts; others[who?] feel that
  to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that
  the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering
  has driven much development in mathematics. One way this difference of viewpoint
  plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is created (as
  in art) or discovered (as in science). It is common to see universities divided
  into sections that include a division of Science and Mathematics, indicating that
  the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide. In practice,
  mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated
  at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the philosophy of mathematics.[citation
  needed]\nInspiration, pure and applied mathematics, and aesthetics\nMain article:
  Mathematical beauty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaac Newton (left) and Gottfried Wilhelm
  Leibniz (right), developers of infinitesimal calculus\n\n\nMathematics arises from
  many different kinds of problems. At first these were found in commerce, land measurement,
  architecture and later astronomy; today, all sciences suggest problems studied by
  mathematicians, and many problems arise within mathematics itself. For example,
  the physicist Richard Feynman invented the path integral formulation of quantum
  mechanics using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight, and
  today's string theory, a still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify
  the four fundamental forces of nature, continues to inspire new mathematics.[39]\nSome
  mathematics is relevant only in the area that inspired it, and is applied to solve
  further problems in that area. But often mathematics inspired by one area proves
  useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts. A distinction
  is often made between pure mathematics and applied mathematics. However pure mathematics
  topics often turn out to have applications, e.g. number theory in cryptography.
  This remarkable fact, that even the \"purest\" mathematics often turns out to have
  practical applications, is what Eugene Wigner has called \"the unreasonable effectiveness
  of mathematics\".[40] As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the
  scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized

  Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside
  of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including statistics,
  operations research, and computer science.\nFor those who are mathematically inclined,
  there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics. Many mathematicians
  talk about the elegance of mathematics, its intrinsic aesthetics and inner beauty.
  Simplicity and generality are valued. There is beauty in a simple and elegant proof,
  such as Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers, and in an elegant
  numerical method that speeds calculation, such as the fast Fourier transform. G.H.
  Hardy in A Mathematician's Apology expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations
  are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He identified
  criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors
  that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic.[42] Mathematicians often strive to
  find proofs that are particularly elegant, proofs from \"The Book\" of God according
  to Paul Erdős.[43][44] The popularity of recreational mathematics is another sign
  of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions.\nNotation, language,
  and rigor\nMain article: Mathematical notation\n\n\n\n\nLeonhard Euler, who created
  and popularized much of the mathematical notation used today\n\n\nMost of the mathematical
  notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century.[45] Before that,
  mathematics was written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery.[46]Euler
  (1707–1783) was responsible for many of the notations in use today. Modern notation
  makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it
  daunting. It is compressed: a few symbols contain a great deal of information. Like
  musical notation, modern mathematical notation has a strict syntax and encodes information
  that would be difficult to write in any other way.\nMathematical language can be
  difficult to understand for beginners. Common words such as or and only have more
  precise meanings than in everyday speech. Moreover, words such as open and field
  have specialized mathematical meanings. Technical terms such as homeomorphism and
  integrable have precise meanings in mathematics. Additionally, shorthand phrases
  such as iff for \"if and only if\" belong to mathematical jargon. There is a reason
  for special notation and technical vocabulary: mathematics requires more precision
  than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic
  as \"rigor\".\nMathematical proof is fundamentally a matter of rigor. Mathematicians
  want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This
  is to avoid mistaken \"theorems\", based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances
  have occurred in the history of the subject.[47] The level of rigor expected in
  mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at
  the time of Isaac Newton the methods employed were less rigorous. Problems inherent
  in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis
  and formal proof in the 19th century. Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for
  some of the common misconceptions of mathematics. Today, mathematicians continue
  to argue among themselves about computer-assisted proofs. Since large computations
  are hard to verify, such proofs may not be sufficiently rigorous.[48]\nAxioms in
  traditional thought were \"self-evident truths\", but that conception is problematic.[49]
  At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic
  meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an axiomatic system. It
  was the goal of Hilbert's program to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic
  basis, but according to Gödel's incompleteness theorem every (sufficiently powerful)
  axiomatic system has undecidable formulas; and so a final axiomatization of mathematics
  is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal
  content) nothing but set theory in some axiomatization, in the sense that every
  mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.[50]\nFields
  of mathematics\nSee also: Areas of mathematics and Glossary of areas of mathematics\n\n\n\n\nAn
  abacus, a simple calculating tool used since ancient times\n\n\nMathematics can,
  broadly speaking, be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space, and
  change (i.e. arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and analysis). In addition to these
  main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the
  heart of mathematics to other fields: to logic, to set theory (foundations), to
  the empirical mathematics of the various sciences (applied mathematics), and more
  recently to the rigorous study of uncertainty. While some areas might seem unrelated,
  the Langlands program has found connections between areas previously thought unconnected,
  such as Galois groups, Riemann surfaces and number theory.\nFoundations and philosophy\nIn
  order to clarify the foundations of mathematics, the fields of mathematical logic
  and set theory were developed. Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study
  of logic and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set
  theory is the branch of mathematics that studies sets or collections of objects.
  Category theory, which deals in an abstract way with mathematical structures and
  relationships between them, is still in development. The phrase \"crisis of foundations\"
  describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from
  approximately 1900 to 1930.[51] Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics
  continues to the present day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number
  of controversies at the time, including the controversy over Cantor's set theory
  and the Brouwer–Hilbert controversy.\nMathematical logic is concerned with setting
  mathematics within a rigorous axiomatic framework, and studying the implications
  of such a framework. As such, it is home to Gödel's incompleteness theorems which
  (informally) imply that any effective formal system that contains basic arithmetic,
  if sound (meaning that all theorems that can be proven are true), is necessarily
  incomplete (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved in that
  system). Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation,
  Gödel showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical
  fact, but which does not follow from those axioms. Therefore, no formal system is
  a complete axiomatization of full number theory. Modern logic is divided into recursion
  theory, model theory, and proof theory, and is closely linked to theoretical computer
  science,[citation needed] as well as to category theory.\nTheoretical computer science
  includes computability theory, computational complexity theory, and information
  theory. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models
  of the computer, including the most well-known model – the Turing machine. Complexity
  theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically
  solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them
  is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of computer
  hardware. A famous problem is the \"P = NP?\" problem, one of the Millennium Prize
  Problems.[52] Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that
  can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as compression
  and entropy.\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematical logic\nSet theory\nCategory theory\nTheory
  of computation\n\nPure mathematics\nQuantity\nThe study of quantity starts with
  numbers, first the familiar natural numbers and integers (\"whole numbers\") and
  arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in arithmetic. The deeper
  properties of integers are studied in number theory, from which come such popular
  results as Fermat's Last Theorem. The twin prime conjecture and Goldbach's conjecture
  are two unsolved problems in number theory.\nAs the number system is further developed,
  the integers are recognized as a subset of the rational numbers (\"fractions\").
  These, in turn, are contained within the real numbers, which are used to represent
  continuous quantities. Real numbers are generalized to complex numbers. These are
  the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include quaternions and
  octonions. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the transfinite numbers,
  which formalize the concept of \"infinity\". Another area of study is size, which
  leads to the cardinal numbers and then to another conception of infinity: the aleph
  numbers, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural
  numbers\nIntegers\nRational numbers\nReal numbers\nComplex numbers\n\nStructure\nMany
  mathematical objects, such as sets of numbers and functions, exhibit internal structure
  as a consequence of operations or relations that are defined on the set. Mathematics
  then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure;
  for instance number theory studies properties of the set of integers that can be
  expressed in terms of arithmetic operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that
  different such structured sets (or structures) exhibit similar properties, which
  makes it possible, by a further step of abstraction, to state axioms for a class
  of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these
  axioms. Thus one can study groups, rings, fields and other abstract systems; together
  such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain
  of abstract algebra.\nBy its great generality, abstract algebra can often be applied
  to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning
  compass and straightedge constructions were finally solved using Galois theory,
  which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic theory
  is linear algebra, which is the general study of vector spaces, whose elements called
  vectors have both quantity and direction, and can be used to model (relations between)
  points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated
  areas of geometry and algebra have very strong interactions in modern mathematics.
  Combinatorics studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given
  structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombinatorics\nNumber theory\nGroup theory\nGraph theory\nOrder
  theory\nAlgebra\n\nSpace\nThe study of space originates with geometry – in particular,
  Euclidean geometry. Trigonometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships
  between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions;
  it combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known Pythagorean theorem.
  The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional
  geometry, non-Euclidean geometries (which play a central role in general relativity)
  and topology. Quantity and space both play a role in analytic geometry, differential
  geometry, and algebraic geometry. Convex and discrete geometry were developed to
  solve problems in number theory and functional analysis but now are pursued with
  an eye on applications in optimization and computer science. Within differential
  geometry are the concepts of fiber bundles and calculus on manifolds, in particular,
  vector and tensor calculus. Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric
  objects as solution sets of polynomial equations, combining the concepts of quantity
  and space, and also the study of topological groups, which combine structure and
  space. Lie groups are used to study space, structure, and change. Topology in all
  its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in 20th-century mathematics;
  it includes point-set topology, set-theoretic topology, algebraic topology and differential
  topology. In particular, instances of modern-day topology are metrizability theory,
  axiomatic set theory, homotopy theory, and Morse theory. Topology also includes
  the now solved Poincaré conjecture, and the still unsolved areas of the Hodge conjecture.
  Other results in geometry and topology, including the four color theorem and Kepler
  conjecture, have been proved only with the help of computers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometry\nTrigonometry\nDifferential
  geometry\nTopology\nFractal geometry\nMeasure theory\n\nChange\nUnderstanding and
  describing change is a common theme in the natural sciences, and calculus was developed
  as a powerful tool to investigate it. Functions arise here, as a central concept
  describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of real numbers and functions
  of a real variable is known as real analysis, with complex analysis the equivalent
  field for the complex numbers. Functional analysis focuses attention on (typically
  infinite-dimensional) spaces of functions. One of many applications of functional
  analysis is quantum mechanics. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between
  a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as differential equations.
  Many phenomena in nature can be described by dynamical systems; chaos theory makes
  precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still
  deterministic behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculus\nVector calculus\nDifferential equations\nDynamical
  systems\nChaos theory\nComplex analysis\nApplied mathematics\nApplied mathematics
  concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering,
  business, and industry. Thus, \"applied mathematics\" is a mathematical science
  with specialized knowledge. The term applied mathematics also describes the professional
  specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused
  on practical problems, applied mathematics focuses on the \"formulation, study,
  and use of mathematical models\" in science, engineering, and other areas of mathematical
  practice.\nIn the past, practical applications have motivated the development of
  mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics,
  where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of
  applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in pure mathematics.\nStatistics
  and other decision sciences\nApplied mathematics has significant overlap with the
  discipline of statistics, whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially
  with probability theory. Statisticians (working as part of a research project) \"create
  data that makes sense\" with random sampling and with randomized experiments;[53]
  the design of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data
  (before the data be available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples
  or when analyzing data from observational studies, statisticians \"make sense of
  the data\" using the art of modelling and the theory of inference – with model selection
  and estimation; the estimated models and consequential predictions should be tested
  on new data.[54]\nStatistical theory studies decision problems such as minimizing
  the risk (expected loss) of a statistical action, such as using a procedure in,
  for example, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and selecting the best. In
  these traditional areas of mathematical statistics, a statistical-decision problem
  is formulated by minimizing an objective function, like expected loss or cost, under
  specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing
  the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence.[55] Because
  of its use of optimization, the mathematical theory of statistics shares concerns
  with other decision sciences, such as operations research, control theory, and mathematical
  economics.[56]\nComputational mathematics\nComputational mathematics proposes and
  studies methods for solving mathematical problems that are typically too large for
  human numerical capacity. Numerical analysis studies methods for problems in analysis
  using functional analysis and approximation theory; numerical analysis includes
  the study of approximation and discretization broadly with special concern for rounding
  errors. Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic
  topics of mathematical science, especially algorithmic matrix and graph theory.
  Other areas of computational mathematics include computer algebra and symbolic computation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematical

  in mathematics is the Fields Medal,[57][58] established in 1936 and now awarded
  every four years. The Fields Medal is often considered a mathematical equivalent
  to the Nobel Prize.\nThe Wolf Prize in Mathematics, instituted in 1978, recognizes
  lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the Abel Prize, was
  introduced in 2003. The Chern Medal was introduced in 2010 to recognize lifetime
  achievement. These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular body of
  work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an outstanding problem
  in an established field.\nA famous list of 23 open problems, called \"Hilbert's
  problems\", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician David Hilbert. This list
  achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems
  have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the \"Millennium
  Prize Problems\", was published in 2000. A solution to each of these problems carries
  a $1 million reward, and only one (the Riemann hypothesis) is duplicated in Hilbert's
  problems.\nSee also\nMain article: Lists of mathematics topics\nMathematics and

  /* @nomin */\n} );Mathematics (from Greek μάθημα máthēma, “knowledge, study, learning”)
  is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers),[2]structure,[3]space,[2] and
  change.[4][5][6] There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers
  as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.[7][8]Mathematicians seek out
  patterns[9][10] and use them to formulate new conjectures. Mathematicians resolve
  the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof. When mathematical structures
  are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight
  or predictions about nature. Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics
  developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the
  shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity
  for as far back as written records exist. The research required to solve mathematical
  problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.Rigorous arguments
  first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements. Since the
  pioneering work of Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932), David Hilbert (1862–1943), and others
  on axiomatic systems in the late 19th century, it has become customary to view mathematical
  research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms
  and definitions. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance,
  when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to
  a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the
  present day.[11]Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) said, \"The universe cannot be read
  until we have learned the language and become familiar with the characters in which
  it is written. It is written in mathematical language, and the letters are triangles,
  circles and other geometrical figures, without which means it is humanly impossible
  to comprehend a single word. Without these, one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth.\"[12]Carl
  Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) referred to mathematics as \"the Queen of the Sciences\".[13]Benjamin
  Peirce (1809–1880) called mathematics \"the science that draws necessary conclusions\".[14]
  David Hilbert said of mathematics: \"We are not speaking here of arbitrariness in
  any sense. Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily
  stipulated rules. Rather, it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity
  that can only be so and by no means otherwise.\"[15]Albert Einstein (1879–1955)
  stated that \"as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain;
  and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.\"[16] French mathematician
  Claire Voisin states \"There is creative drive in mathematics, it's all about movement
  trying to express itself.\" [17]Mathematics is essential in many fields, including
  natural science, engineering, medicine, finance and the social sciences. Applied
  mathematics has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics
  and game theory. Mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics, or mathematics
  for its own sake, without having any application in mind. There is no clear line
  separating pure and applied mathematics, and practical applications for what began
  as pure mathematics are often discovered.[18]The history of mathematics can be seen
  as an ever-increasing series of abstractions. The first abstraction, which is shared
  by many animals,[19] was probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection
  of two apples and a collection of two oranges (for example) have something in common,
  namely quantity of their members.As evidenced by tallies found on bone, in addition
  to recognizing how to count physical objects, prehistoric peoples may have also
  recognized how to count abstract quantities, like time – days, seasons, years.[20]More
  complex mathematics did not appear until around 3000 BC, when the Babylonians and
  Egyptians began using arithmetic, algebra and geometry for taxation and other financial
  calculations, for building and construction, and for astronomy.[21] The earliest
  uses of mathematics were in trading, land measurement, painting and weaving patterns
  and the recording of time.In Babylonian mathematics elementary arithmetic (addition,
  subtraction, multiplication and division) first appears in the archaeological record.
  Numeracy pre-dated writing and numeral systems have been many and diverse, with
  the first known written numerals created by Egyptians in Middle Kingdom texts such
  as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus.[citation needed]Between 600 and 300 BC the Ancient
  Greeks began a systematic study of mathematics in its own right with Greek mathematics.[22]Mathematics
  has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between
  mathematics and science, to the benefit of both. Mathematical discoveries continue
  to be made today. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January 2006 issue of
  the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, \"The number of papers and books
  included in the Mathematical Reviews database since 1940 (the first year of operation
  of MR) is now more than 1.9 million, and more than 75 thousand items are added to
  the database each year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain
  new mathematical theorems and their proofs.\"[23]The word mathematics comes from
  the Greek μάθημα (máthēma), which, in the ancient Greek language, means \"that which
  is learnt\",[24] \"what one gets to know\", hence also \"study\" and \"science\",
  and in modern Greek just \"lesson\". The word máthēma is derived from μανθάνω (manthano),
  while the modern Greek equivalent is μαθαίνω (mathaino), both of which mean \"to
  learn\". In Greece, the word for \"mathematics\" came to have the narrower and more
  technical meaning \"mathematical study\" even in Classical times.[25] Its adjective
  is μαθηματικός (mathēmatikós), meaning \"related to learning\" or \"studious\",
  which likewise further came to mean \"mathematical\". In particular, μαθηματικὴ
  τέχνη (mathēmatikḗ tékhnē), Latin: ars mathematica, meant \"the mathematical art\".In
  Latin, and in English until around 1700, the term mathematics more commonly meant
  \"astrology\" (or sometimes \"astronomy\") rather than \"mathematics\"; the meaning
  gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. This has resulted
  in several mistranslations: a particularly notorious one is Saint Augustine's warning
  that Christians should beware of mathematici meaning astrologers, which is sometimes
  mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.[26]The apparent plural form in
  English, like the French plural form les mathématiques (and the less commonly used
  singular derivative la mathématique), goes back to the Latin neuter plural mathematica
  (Cicero), based on the Greek plural τα μαθηματικά (ta mathēmatiká), used by Aristotle
  (384–322 BC), and meaning roughly \"all things mathematical\"; although it is plausible
  that English borrowed only the adjective mathematic(al) and formed the noun mathematics
  anew, after the pattern of physics and metaphysics, which were inherited from the
  Greek.[27] In English, the noun mathematics takes singular verb forms. It is often
  shortened to maths or, in English-speaking North America, math.[28]Aristotle defined
  mathematics as \"the science of quantity\", and this definition prevailed until
  the 18th century.[29] Starting in the 19th century, when the study of mathematics
  increased in rigor and began to address abstract topics such as group theory and
  projective geometry, which have no clear-cut relation to quantity and measurement,
  mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety of new definitions.[30]
  Some of these definitions emphasize the deductive character of much of mathematics,
  some emphasize its abstractness, some emphasize certain topics within mathematics.
  Today, no consensus on the definition of mathematics prevails, even among professionals.[7]
  There is not even consensus on whether mathematics is an art or a science.[8] A
  great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of mathematics,
  or consider it undefinable.[7] Some just say, \"Mathematics is what mathematicians
  do.\"[7]Three leading types of definition of mathematics are called logicist, intuitionist,
  and formalist, each reflecting a different philosophical school of thought.[31]
  All have severe problems, none has widespread acceptance, and no reconciliation
  seems possible.[31]An early definition of mathematics in terms of logic was Benjamin
  Peirce's \"the science that draws necessary conclusions\" (1870).[32] In the Principia
  Mathematica, Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead advanced the philosophical
  program known as logicism, and attempted to prove that all mathematical concepts,
  statements, and principles can be defined and proven entirely in terms of symbolic
  logic. A logicist definition of mathematics is Russell's \"All Mathematics is Symbolic
  Logic\" (1903).[33]Intuitionist definitions, developing from the philosophy of mathematician
  L.E.J. Brouwer, identify mathematics with certain mental phenomena. An example of
  an intuitionist definition is \"Mathematics is the mental activity which consists
  in carrying out constructs one after the other.\"[31] A peculiarity of intuitionism
  is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid according to other definitions.
  In particular, while other philosophies of mathematics allow objects that can be
  proven to exist even though they cannot be constructed, intuitionism allows only
  mathematical objects that one can actually construct.Formalist definitions identify
  mathematics with its symbols and the rules for operating on them. Haskell Curry
  defined mathematics simply as \"the science of formal systems\".[34] A formal system
  is a set of symbols, or tokens, and some rules telling how the tokens may be combined
  into formulas. In formal systems, the word axiom has a special meaning, different
  from the ordinary meaning of \"a self-evident truth\". In formal systems, an axiom
  is a combination of tokens that is included in a given formal system without needing
  to be derived using the rules of the system.Gauss referred to mathematics as \"the
  Queen of the Sciences\".[13] In the original Latin Regina Scientiarum, as well as
  in German Königin der Wissenschaften, the word corresponding to science means a
  \"field of knowledge\", and this was the original meaning of \"science\" in English,
  also; mathematics is in this sense a field of knowledge. The specialization restricting
  the meaning of \"science\" to natural science follows the rise of Baconian science,
  which contrasted \"natural science\" to scholasticism, the Aristotelean method of
  inquiring from first principles. The role of empirical experimentation and observation
  is negligible in mathematics, compared to natural sciences such as psychology, biology,
  or physics. Albert Einstein stated that \"as far as the laws of mathematics refer
  to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer
  to reality.\"[16] More recently, Marcus du Sautoy has called mathematics \"the Queen
  of Science ... the main driving force behind scientific discovery\".[35]Many philosophers
  believe that mathematics is not experimentally falsifiable, and thus not a science
  according to the definition of Karl Popper.[36] However, in the 1930s Gödel's incompleteness
  theorems convinced many mathematicians[who?] that mathematics cannot be reduced
  to logic alone, and Karl Popper concluded that \"most mathematical theories are,
  like those of physics and biology, hypothetico-deductive: pure mathematics therefore
  turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures,
  than it seemed even recently.\"[37] Other thinkers, notably Imre Lakatos, have applied
  a version of falsificationism to mathematics itself.An alternative view is that
  certain scientific fields (such as theoretical physics) are mathematics with axioms
  that are intended to correspond to reality. The theoretical physicist J.M. Ziman
  proposed that science is public knowledge, and thus includes mathematics.[38] Mathematics
  shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably the exploration
  of the logical consequences of assumptions. Intuition and experimentation also play
  a role in the formulation of conjectures in both mathematics and the (other) sciences.
  Experimental mathematics continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and
  computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and
  mathematics.The opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians[who?]
  feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic
  side, and its history in the traditional seven liberal arts; others[who?] feel that
  to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that
  the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering
  has driven much development in mathematics. One way this difference of viewpoint
  plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is created (as
  in art) or discovered (as in science). It is common to see universities divided
  into sections that include a division of Science and Mathematics, indicating that
  the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide. In practice,
  mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated
  at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the philosophy of mathematics.[citation
  needed]Mathematics arises from many different kinds of problems. At first these
  were found in commerce, land measurement, architecture and later astronomy; today,
  all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians, and many problems arise
  within mathematics itself. For example, the physicist Richard Feynman invented the
  path integral formulation of quantum mechanics using a combination of mathematical
  reasoning and physical insight, and today's string theory, a still-developing scientific
  theory which attempts to unify the four fundamental forces of nature, continues
  to inspire new mathematics.[39]Some mathematics is relevant only in the area that
  inspired it, and is applied to solve further problems in that area. But often mathematics
  inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of
  mathematical concepts. A distinction is often made between pure mathematics and
  applied mathematics. However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications,
  e.g. number theory in cryptography. This remarkable fact, that even the \"purest\"
  mathematics often turns out to have practical applications, is what Eugene Wigner
  has called \"the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics\".[40] As in most areas
  of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization:
  there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest Mathematics
  Subject Classification runs to 46 pages.[41] Several areas of applied mathematics
  have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines
  in their own right, including statistics, operations research, and computer science.For
  those who are mathematically inclined, there is often a definite aesthetic aspect
  to much of mathematics. Many mathematicians talk about the elegance of mathematics,
  its intrinsic aesthetics and inner beauty. Simplicity and generality are valued.
  There is beauty in a simple and elegant proof, such as Euclid's proof that there
  are infinitely many prime numbers, and in an elegant numerical method that speeds
  calculation, such as the fast Fourier transform. G.H. Hardy in A Mathematician's
  Apology expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves,
  sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He identified criteria such
  as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors that contribute
  to a mathematical aesthetic.[42] Mathematicians often strive to find proofs that
  are particularly elegant, proofs from \"The Book\" of God according to Paul Erdős.[43][44]
  The popularity of recreational mathematics is another sign of the pleasure many
  find in solving mathematical questions.Most of the mathematical notation in use
  today was not invented until the 16th century.[45] Before that, mathematics was
  written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery.[46]Euler (1707–1783) was
  responsible for many of the notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics
  much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. It is compressed:
  a few symbols contain a great deal of information. Like musical notation, modern
  mathematical notation has a strict syntax and encodes information that would be
  difficult to write in any other way.Mathematical language can be difficult to understand
  for beginners. Common words such as or and only have more precise meanings than
  in everyday speech. Moreover, words such as open and field have specialized mathematical
  meanings. Technical terms such as homeomorphism and integrable have precise meanings
  in mathematics. Additionally, shorthand phrases such as iff for \"if and only if\"
  belong to mathematical jargon. There is a reason for special notation and technical
  vocabulary: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians
  refer to this precision of language and logic as \"rigor\".Mathematical proof is
  fundamentally a matter of rigor. Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from
  axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This is to avoid mistaken \"theorems\",
  based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history
  of the subject.[47] The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time:
  the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at the time of Isaac Newton the methods
  employed were less rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton
  would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th century.
  Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics.
  Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about computer-assisted
  proofs. Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may not be sufficiently
  rigorous.[48]Axioms in traditional thought were \"self-evident truths\", but that
  conception is problematic.[49] At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols,
  which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of
  an axiomatic system. It was the goal of Hilbert's program to put all of mathematics
  on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to Gödel's incompleteness theorem every
  (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has undecidable formulas; and so a final
  axiomatization of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined
  to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but set theory in some axiomatization,
  in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas
  within set theory.[50]Mathematics can, broadly speaking, be subdivided into the
  study of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e. arithmetic, algebra, geometry,
  and analysis). In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated
  to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields: to logic, to set
  theory (foundations), to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences (applied
  mathematics), and more recently to the rigorous study of uncertainty. While some
  areas might seem unrelated, the Langlands program has found connections between
  areas previously thought unconnected, such as Galois groups, Riemann surfaces and
  number theory.In order to clarify the foundations of mathematics, the fields of
  mathematical logic and set theory were developed. Mathematical logic includes the
  mathematical study of logic and the applications of formal logic to other areas
  of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies sets or collections
  of objects. Category theory, which deals in an abstract way with mathematical structures
  and relationships between them, is still in development. The phrase \"crisis of
  foundations\" describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that
  took place from approximately 1900 to 1930.[51] Some disagreement about the foundations
  of mathematics continues to the present day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated
  by a number of controversies at the time, including the controversy over Cantor's
  set theory and the Brouwer–Hilbert controversy.Mathematical logic is concerned with
  setting mathematics within a rigorous axiomatic framework, and studying the implications
  of such a framework. As such, it is home to Gödel's incompleteness theorems which
  (informally) imply that any effective formal system that contains basic arithmetic,
  if sound (meaning that all theorems that can be proven are true), is necessarily
  incomplete (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved in that
  system). Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation,
  Gödel showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical
  fact, but which does not follow from those axioms. Therefore, no formal system is
  a complete axiomatization of full number theory. Modern logic is divided into recursion
  theory, model theory, and proof theory, and is closely linked to theoretical computer
  science,[citation needed] as well as to category theory.Theoretical computer science
  includes computability theory, computational complexity theory, and information
  theory. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models
  of the computer, including the most well-known model – the Turing machine. Complexity
  theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically
  solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them
  is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of computer
  hardware. A famous problem is the \"P = NP?\" problem, one of the Millennium Prize
  Problems.[52] Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that
  can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as compression
  and entropy.The study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar natural
  numbers and integers (\"whole numbers\") and arithmetical operations on them, which
  are characterized in arithmetic. The deeper properties of integers are studied in
  number theory, from which come such popular results as Fermat's Last Theorem. The
  twin prime conjecture and Goldbach's conjecture are two unsolved problems in number
  theory.As the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as
  a subset of the rational numbers (\"fractions\"). These, in turn, are contained
  within the real numbers, which are used to represent continuous quantities. Real
  numbers are generalized to complex numbers. These are the first steps of a hierarchy
  of numbers that goes on to include quaternions and octonions. Consideration of the
  natural numbers also leads to the transfinite numbers, which formalize the concept
  of \"infinity\". Another area of study is size, which leads to the cardinal numbers
  and then to another conception of infinity: the aleph numbers, which allow meaningful
  comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.Many mathematical objects, such
  as sets of numbers and functions, exhibit internal structure as a consequence of
  operations or relations that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties
  of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance number
  theory studies properties of the set of integers that can be expressed in terms
  of arithmetic operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured
  sets (or structures) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further
  step of abstraction, to state axioms for a class of structures, and then study at
  once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study groups,
  rings, fields and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures
  defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of abstract algebra.By its
  great generality, abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems;
  for instance a number of ancient problems concerning compass and straightedge constructions
  were finally solved using Galois theory, which involves field theory and group theory.
  Another example of an algebraic theory is linear algebra, which is the general study
  of vector spaces, whose elements called vectors have both quantity and direction,
  and can be used to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example
  of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of geometry and algebra have
  very strong interactions in modern mathematics. Combinatorics studies ways of enumerating
  the number of objects that fit a given structure.The study of space originates with
  geometry – in particular, Euclidean geometry. Trigonometry is the branch of mathematics
  that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and
  with the trigonometric functions; it combines space and numbers, and encompasses
  the well-known Pythagorean theorem. The modern study of space generalizes these
  ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, non-Euclidean geometries (which play
  a central role in general relativity) and topology. Quantity and space both play
  a role in analytic geometry, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry. Convex
  and discrete geometry were developed to solve problems in number theory and functional
  analysis but now are pursued with an eye on applications in optimization and computer
  science. Within differential geometry are the concepts of fiber bundles and calculus
  on manifolds, in particular, vector and tensor calculus. Within algebraic geometry
  is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of polynomial equations,
  combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of topological
  groups, which combine structure and space. Lie groups are used to study space, structure,
  and change. Topology in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth
  area in 20th-century mathematics; it includes point-set topology, set-theoretic
  topology, algebraic topology and differential topology. In particular, instances
  of modern-day topology are metrizability theory, axiomatic set theory, homotopy
  theory, and Morse theory. Topology also includes the now solved Poincaré conjecture,
  and the still unsolved areas of the Hodge conjecture. Other results in geometry
  and topology, including the four color theorem and Kepler conjecture, have been
  proved only with the help of computers.Understanding and describing change is a
  common theme in the natural sciences, and calculus was developed as a powerful tool
  to investigate it. Functions arise here, as a central concept describing a changing
  quantity. The rigorous study of real numbers and functions of a real variable is
  known as real analysis, with complex analysis the equivalent field for the complex
  numbers. Functional analysis focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional)
  spaces of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is quantum
  mechanics. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and
  its rate of change, and these are studied as differential equations. Many phenomena
  in nature can be described by dynamical systems; chaos theory makes precise the
  ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still deterministic
  behavior.Applied mathematics concerns itself with mathematical methods that are
  typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry. Thus, \"applied
  mathematics\" is a mathematical science with specialized knowledge. The term applied
  mathematics also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work
  on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, applied mathematics
  focuses on the \"formulation, study, and use of mathematical models\" in science,
  engineering, and other areas of mathematical practice.In the past, practical applications
  have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject
  of study in pure mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own
  sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research
  in pure mathematics.Applied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline
  of statistics, whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with probability
  theory. Statisticians (working as part of a research project) \"create data that
  makes sense\" with random sampling and with randomized experiments;[53] the design
  of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before
  the data be available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or
  when analyzing data from observational studies, statisticians \"make sense of the
  data\" using the art of modelling and the theory of inference – with model selection
  and estimation; the estimated models and consequential predictions should be tested
  on new data.[54]Statistical theory studies decision problems such as minimizing
  the risk (expected loss) of a statistical action, such as using a procedure in,
  for example, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and selecting the best. In
  these traditional areas of mathematical statistics, a statistical-decision problem
  is formulated by minimizing an objective function, like expected loss or cost, under
  specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing
  the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence.[55] Because
  of its use of optimization, the mathematical theory of statistics shares concerns
  with other decision sciences, such as operations research, control theory, and mathematical
  economics.[56]Computational mathematics proposes and studies methods for solving
  mathematical problems that are typically too large for human numerical capacity.
  Numerical analysis studies methods for problems in analysis using functional analysis
  and approximation theory; numerical analysis includes the study of approximation
  and discretization broadly with special concern for rounding errors. Numerical analysis
  and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical
  science, especially algorithmic matrix and graph theory. Other areas of computational
  mathematics include computer algebra and symbolic computation.Arguably the most
  prestigious award in mathematics is the Fields Medal,[57][58] established in 1936
  and now awarded every four years. The Fields Medal is often considered a mathematical
  equivalent to the Nobel Prize.The Wolf Prize in Mathematics, instituted in 1978,
  recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the Abel
  Prize, was introduced in 2003. The Chern Medal was introduced in 2010 to recognize
  lifetime achievement. These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular
  body of work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an outstanding
  problem in an established field.A famous list of 23 open problems, called \"Hilbert's
  problems\", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician David Hilbert. This list
  achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems
  have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the \"Millennium
  Prize Problems\", was published in 2000. A solution to each of these problems carries
  a $1 million reward, and only one (the Riemann hypothesis) is duplicated in Hilbert's
  problems."
