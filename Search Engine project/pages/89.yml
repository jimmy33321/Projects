  The demarcation between science and pseudoscience is part of the
- |
  larger task to determine which beliefs are epistemically warranted. The
- |
  entry clarifies the specific nature of pseudoscience in relation to
- |
  other forms of non-scientific doctrines and practices. The major
- |
  proposed demarcation criteria are discussed and some of their
- |
  weaknesses are pointed out. In conclusion, it is emphasized that there
- |
  is much more agreement about particular issues of demarcation than on the
- |
  general criteria that such judgments should be based upon. This is an
- |
  indication that there is still much important philosophical work to be
- |
  done on the demarcation between science and pseudoscience.

  1. The purpose of demarcations
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Demarcations of science from pseudoscience can be made for both
- |
  theoretical and practical reasons (Mahner 2007, 516). From a
- |
  theoretical point of view, the demarcation issue is an illuminating
- |
  perspective that contributes to the philosophy of science in the same
- |
  way that the study of fallacies contributes to the study of informal
- |
  logic and rational argumentation. From a practical point of view, the
- |
  distinction is important for decision guidance in both private and
- |
  public life. Since science is our most reliable source of knowledge in
- |
  a wide variety of areas, we need to distinguish scientific knowledge
- |
  from its look-alikes. Due to the high status of science in present-day
- |
  society, attempts to exaggerate the scientific status of various
- |
  claims, teachings, and products are common enough to make the
- |
  demarcation issue pressing in many areas. The demarcation issue is
- |
  therefore important in many practical applications such as the
- |
  following:
- |2+

- |
  Healthcare: Medical science develops and evaluates
- |
  treatments according to evidence of their effectiveness. Pseudoscientific
- |
  activities in this area give rise to ineffective and sometimes
- |
  dangerous interventions. Healthcare providers, insurers, government
- |
  authorities and – most importantly – patients need
- |
  guidance on how to distinguish between medical science and medical
- |
  pseudoscience.
- |2+

- |
  Expert testimony: It is essential for the rule of law
- |
  that courts get the facts right. The reliability of different types of
- |
  evidence must be correctly determined, and expert testimony must be
- |
  based on the best available knowledge. Sometimes it is in the interest
- |
  of litigants to present non-scientific claims as solid science.
- |
  Therefore courts must be able to distinguish between science and
- |
  pseudoscience. Philosophers have often had prominent roles in the
- |
  defence of science against pseudoscience in such contexts. (Hansson
- "2011) \n"
- |2+

- |
  Environmental policies: In order to be on the safe
- |
  side against potential disasters it may be legitimate to take
- |
  preventive measures when there is valid but yet insufficient evidence
- |
  of an environmental hazard. This must be distinguished from taking
- |
  measures against an alleged hazard for which there is no valid
- |
  evidence at all.  Therefore, decision-makers in environmental policy
- |
  must be able to distinguish between scientific and pseudoscientific
- |
  claims.
- |2+

- |
  Science education: The promoters of some
- |
  pseudosciences (notably creationism) try to introduce their teachings
- |
  in school curricula. Teachers and school authorities need to have
- |
  clear criteria of inclusion that protect students against unreliable
- |
  and disproved teachings.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Work on the demarcation problem seems to have waned after Laudan's
- |
  (1983) much noted death certificate according to which there is no
- |
  hope of finding a necessary and sufficient criterion of something as
- |
  heterogeneous as scientific methodology. In more recent years, the
- |
  problem has been revitalized. Philosophers attesting to its vitality
- |
  maintain that the concept can be clarified by other means than a
- |
  necessary and sufficient definition (Pigliucci 2013; Mahner 2013) or
- |
  that such a definition is indeed possible although it has to be
- |
  supplemented with discipline-specific criteria in order to become
- |
  fully operative. (Hansson 2013)
- |2+

- |
  2. The “science” of pseudoscience
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The oldest known use of the word “pseudoscience” dates
- |
  from 1796 when the historian James Pettit Andrew referred to alchemy
- |
  as a “fantastical pseudo-science” (Oxford English
- |
  Dictionary). The word has been in frequent use since the 1880s (Thurs
- |
  and Numbers 2013). Throughout its history the word has had a
- |
  clearly defamatory meaning (Laudan 1983, 119; Dolby 1987, 204). It
- |
  would be as strange for someone to proudly describe her own activities
- |
  as pseudoscience as to boast that they are bad science. Since the
- |
  derogatory connotation is an essential characteristic of the word
- |
  “pseudoscience”, an attempt to extricate a value-free
- |
  definition of the term would not be meaningful. An essentially
- |
  value-laden term has to be defined in value-laden terms. This is often
- |
  difficult since the specification of the value component tends to be
- |
  controversial.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  This problem is not specific to pseudoscience but follows directly
- |
  from a parallel but somewhat less conspicuous problem with the concept
- |
  of science. The common usage of the term “science” can be
- |
  described as partly descriptive, partly normative. When an activity is
- |
  recognized as science this usually involves an acknowledgement that it
- |
  has a positive role in our strivings for knowledge. On the other hand
- |
  the concept of science has been formed through a historical process,
- |
  and many contingencies influence what we call and do not call
- |
  science.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Against this background, in order not to be unduly complex a
- |
  definition of science has to go in either of two ways. It can focus on
- |
  the descriptive contents, and specify how the term is actually used.
- |
  Alternatively, it can focus on the normative element, and clarify the
- |
  more fundamental meaning of the term. The latter approach has been the
- |
  choice of most philosophers writing on the subject, and will be at
- |
  focus here. It involves, of necessity, some degree of idealization in
- |
  relation to common usage of the term “science”.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The English word “science” is primarily used about the
- |
  natural sciences and other fields of research that are considered to be
- |
  similar to them. Hence, political economy and sociology are counted as
- |
  sciences, whereas studies of literature and history are usually not.
- |
  The corresponding German word, “Wissenschaft”, has a much
- |
  broader meaning and includes all the academic specialties, including
- |
  the humanities. The German term has the advantage of more adequately
- |
  delimiting of the type of systematic knowledge that is at stake in the
- |
  conflict between science and pseudoscience. The misrepresentations of
- |
  history presented by Holocaust deniers and other pseudo-historians are
- |
  very similar in nature to the misrepresentations of natural science
- |
  promoted by creationists and homeopaths.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  More importantly, the natural and social sciences and the humanities
- |
  are all parts of the same human endeavour, namely systematic and
- |
  critical investigations aimed at acquiring the best possible
- |
  understanding of the workings of nature, people, and human
- |
  society. The disciplines that form this community of knowledge
- |
  disciplines are increasingly interdependent (Hansson 2007). Since
- |
  the second half of the 20th century, integrative disciplines such as
- |
  astrophysics, evolutionary biology, biochemistry, ecology, quantum
- |
  chemistry, the neurosciences, and game theory have developed at
- |
  dramatic speed and contributed to tying together previously
- |
  unconnected disciplines. These increased interconnections have also
- |
  linked the sciences and the humanities closer to each other, as can be
- |
  seen for instance from how historical knowledge relies increasingly on
- |
  advanced scientific analysis of archaeological findings.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The conflict between science and pseudoscience is best understood
- |
  with this extended sense of science. On one side of the conflict we
- |
  find the community of knowledge disciplines that includes the natural
- |
  and social sciences and the humanities. On the other side we find a
- |
  wide variety of movements and doctrines, such as creationism,
- |
  astrology, homeopathy, and Holocaust denialism that are in conflict
- |
  with results and methods that are generally accepted in the community
- |
  of knowledge disciplines.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Another way to express this is that the demarcation problem has a
- |
  deeper concern than that of demarcating the selection of human
- |
  activities that we have for various reasons chosen to call
- |
  “sciences”. The ultimate issue is “how to determine
- |
  which beliefs are epistemically warranted” (Fuller 1985,
- |
  331).
- |2+

- |
  3. The “pseudo” of pseudoscience
- |2+

- |
  3.1 Non-, un-, and pseudoscience
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The phrases “demarcation of science” and
- |
  “demarcation of science from pseudoscience” are often used
- |
  interchangeably, and many authors seem to have regarded them as equal
- |
  in meaning. In their view the task of drawing the outer boundaries of
- |
  science is essentially the same as that of drawing the boundary between
- |
  science and pseudoscience.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  This picture is oversimplified. All non-science is not
- |
  pseudoscience, and science has non-trivial borders to other
- |
  non-scientific phenomena, such as metaphysics, religion, and various
- |
  types of non-scientific systematized knowledge. (Mahner (2007, 548)
- |
  proposed the term “parascience” to cover non-scientific
- |
  practices that are not pseudoscientific.) Science also has the internal
- |
  demarcation problem of distinguishing between good and bad science.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  A comparison of the negated terms related to science can contribute
- |
  to clarify the conceptual distinctions. “Unscientific” is a
- |
  narrower concept than “non-scientific” (not scientific),
- |
  since the former but not the latter term implies some form of
- |
  contradiction or conflict with science. “Pseudoscientific”
- |
  is in its turn a narrower concept than “unscientific”. The
- |
  latter term differs from the former in covering inadvertent
- |
  mismeasurements and miscalculations and other forms of bad science
- |
  performed by scientists who are recognized as trying but failing to
- |
  produce good science.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Etymology provides us with an obvious starting-point for clarifying
- |
  what characteristics pseudoscience has in addition to being merely
- |
  non- or un-scientific. “Pseudo-”
- |
  (ψευδο-) means false. In accordance
- |
  with this, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines pseudoscience
- |
  as follows:
- |2+

- |
  “A pretended or spurious science; a collection of
- |
  related beliefs about the world mistakenly regarded as being based on
- |
  scientific method or as having the status that scientific truths now
- |
  have.”
- |2+

- |
  3.2 Non-science posing as science
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is
- |
  non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the
- |
  subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title Fads and Fallacies in the
- |
  Name of Science. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438),
- |
  “[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they
- |
  masquerade as genuinely scientific ones.” These and many other
- |
  authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching
- |
  has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996):
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  (1)
- |2
   it is not scientific, and
- |
  (2)
- |
  its major proponents try to create the impression that it is
- "scientific. \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The former of these two criteria is central to the concerns of the
- |
  philosophy of science. It has been the subject of important
- |
  controversies among philosophers, to be discussed below in Section 4.
- |
  The second criterion is philosophically less important, but it needs
- |
  careful treatment not least since many discussions of pseudoscience (in
- |
  and out of philosophy) have been confused due to insufficient attention
- |
  to it.
- |2+

- |
  3.3 The doctrinal component
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  An immediate problem with the definition based on (1) and (2) is
- |
  that it is too wide. There are phenomena that satisfy both criteria but
- |
  are not commonly called pseudoscientific. One of the clearest
- |
  examples of this is fraud in science. This is a practice that has a
- |
  high degree of scientific pretence and yet does not comply with
- |
  science, thus satisfying both criteria. Nevertheless, fraud in
- |
  otherwise legitimate branches of science is seldom if ever called
- |
  “pseudoscience”. The reason for this can be clarified with
- |
  the following hypothetical examples (Hansson 1996).
- |2+

- |
  Case 1: A biochemist performs an experiment that
- |
  she interprets as showing that a particular protein has an essential
- |
  rôle in muscle contraction. There is a consensus among her
- |
  colleagues that the result is a mere artefact, due to experimental
- |
  error.
- |2+

- |
  Case 2: A biochemist goes on performing one sloppy
- |
  experiment after the other. She consistently interprets them as showing
- |
  that a particular protein has a rôle in muscle contraction not
- |
  accepted by other scientists.
- |2+

- |
  Case 3: A biochemist performs various sloppy
- |
  experiments in different areas. One is the experiment referred to in
- |
  case 1. Much of her work is of the same quality. She does not propagate
- |
  any particular unorthodox theory.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  According to common usage, 1 and 3 are regarded as cases of bad
- |
  science, and only 2 as a case of pseudoscience. What is present in case
- |
  2, but absent in the other two, is a deviant doctrine.
- |
  Isolated breaches of the requirements of science are not commonly
- |
  regarded as pseudoscientific. Pseudoscience, as it is commonly
- |
  conceived, involves a sustained effort to promote teachings different
- |
  from those that have scientific legitimacy at the time.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  This explains why fraud in science is not usually regarded as
- |
  pseudoscientific. Such practices are not in general associated with a
- |
  deviant or unorthodox doctrine. To the contrary, the fraudulent
- |
  scientist is anxious that her results be in conformity with the
- |
  predictions of established scientific theories. Deviations from these
- |
  would lead to a much higher risk of disclosure.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The term “science” has both an individuated and an
- |
  unindividuated sense. In the individuated sense, biochemistry and
- |
  astronomy are different sciences, one of which includes
- |
  studies of muscle contraction and the other studies of supernovae. The
- |
  Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines this sense of science as
- |
  “a particular branch of knowledge or study; a recognized
- |
  department of learning”. In the unindividuated sense, the study
- |
  of muscle proteins and that of supernovae are parts of “one and
- |
  the same” science. In the words of the OED, unindividuated
- |
  science is “the kind of knowledge or intellectual activity of
- |
  which the various ‘sciences‘ are examples”.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Pseudoscience is an antithesis of science in the individuated rather
- |
  than the unindividuated sense. There is no unified corpus of
- |
  pseudoscience corresponding to the corpus of science. For a phenomenon
- |
  to be pseudoscientific, it must belong to one or the other of the
- |
  particular pseudosciences. In order to accommodate this feature, the
- |
  above definition can be modified by replacing (2) by the following
- |
  (Hansson 1996):
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  (2′)
- |2
   it is part of a
- |
  non-scientific doctrine whose major proponents try to create the
- "impression that it is scientific. \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Most philosophers of science, and most scientists, prefer to regard
- |
  science as constituted by methods of inquiry rather than by particular
- |
  doctrines. There is an obvious tension between (2′) and this
- |
  conventional view of science. This, however, may be as it should since
- |
  pseudoscience often involves a representation of science as a closed
- |
  and finished doctrine rather than as a methodology for open-ended
- |
  inquiry.
- |2+

- |
  3.4 A wider sense of pseudoscience
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Sometimes the term “pseudoscience” is used in a wider
- |
  sense than that which is captured in the definition constituted of (1)
- |
  and (2′). Contrary to (2′), doctrines that conflict with
- |
  science are sometimes called “pseudoscientific” in spite of
- |
  not being advanced as scientific. Hence, Grove (1985, 219) included
- |
  among the pseudoscientific doctrines those that “purport to offer
- |
  alternative accounts to those of science or claim to explain what
- |
  science cannot explain.” Similarly, Lugg (1987, 227–228)
- |
  maintained that “the clairvoyant's predictions are
- |
  pseudoscientific whether or not they are correct”, despite the
- |
  fact that most clairvoyants do not profess to be practitioners of
- |
  science. In this sense, pseudoscience is assumed to include not only
- |
  doctrines contrary to science proclaimed to be scientific but
- |
  doctrines contrary to science tout court, whether or not they
- |
  are put forward in the name of science. To cover this wider sense of
- |
  pseudoscience, (2′) can be modified as follows (Hansson 1996, 2013):
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  (2″)
- |
  it is part of a doctrine whose major proponents try to create the
- |
  impression that it represents the most reliable knowledge on its
- |
  subject matter.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Common usage seems to vacillate between the definitions
- |
  (1)+(2′) and (1)+(2″); and this in an interesting
- |
  way: In their comments on the meaning of the term, critics of
- |
  pseudoscience tend to endorse a definition close to (1)+(2′), but
- |
  their actual usage is often closer to (1)+(2″).
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The following examples serve to illustrate the difference between
- |
  the two definitions and also to clarify why clause (1) is needed:
- |2+

- |
  A creationist book gives a correct account of the structure of
- |
  DNA.
- |2+

- |
  An otherwise reliable chemistry book gives an incorrect account of
- |
  the structure of DNA.
- |2+

- |
  A creationist book denies that the human species shares common
- |
  ancestors with other primates.
- |2+

- |
  A preacher who denies that science can be trusted also
- |
  denies that the human species shares common ancestors with other
- |
  primates.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  (a) does not satisfy (1), and is therefore not pseudoscientific on
- |
  either account. (b) satisfies (1) but neither (2′) nor
- |
  (2″) and is therefore not pseudoscientific on either
- |
  account. (c) satisfies all three criteria, (1), (2′), and
- |
  (2″), and is therefore pseudoscientific on both accounts.
- |
  Finally, (d) satisfies (1) and (2″) and is therefore
- |
  pseudoscientific according to (1)+(2″) but not according
- |
  to (1)+(2′). As the last two examples illustrate, pseudoscience
- |
  and anti-science are sometimes difficult to distinguish. Promoters of
- |
  some pseudosciences (notably homeopathy) tend to be ambiguous between
- |
  opposition to science and claims that they themselves represent the
- |
  best science.
- |2+

- |
  3.5 The objects of demarcation
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Various proposals have been put forward on exactly what elements in
- |
  science or pseudoscience criteria of demarcation should be applied to.
- |
  Proposals include that the demarcation should refer to a research
- |
  program (Lakatos 1974a, 248–249), an epistemic field or cognitive
- |
  discipline, i.e. a group of people with common knowledge aims, and
- |
  their practices (Bunge 1982, 2001; Mahner 2007), a theory (Popper
- |
  1962, 1974), a practice (Lugg 1992; Morris 1987), a scientific
- |
  problem or question (Siitonen 1984), and a particular inquiry (Kuhn
- |
  1974; Mayo 1996). It is probably fair to say that demarcation criteria
- |
  can be meaningfully applied on each of these levels of description. A
- |
  much more difficult problem is whether one of these levels is the
- |
  fundamental level to which assessments on the other levels are
- |
  reducible.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Derksen (1993) differs from most other writers on the subject in
- |
  placing the emphasis in demarcation on the pseudoscientist, i.e. the
- |
  individual person conducting pseudoscience. His major argument for this
- |
  is that pseudoscience has scientific pretensions, and such pretensions
- |
  are associated with a person, not a theory, practice or entire field.
- |
  However, as was noted by Settle (1971), it is the rationality and
- |
  critical attitude built into institutions, rather than the personal
- |
  intellectual traits of individuals, that distinguishes science from
- |
  non-scientific practices such as magic. The individual practitioner of
- |
  magic in a pre-literate society is not necessarily less rational than
- |
  the individual scientist in modern Western society. What she lacks is
- |
  an intellectual environment of collective rationality and mutual
- |
  criticism. “It is almost a fallacy of division to insist on each
- |
  individual scientist being critically-minded” (Settle 1971,
- |
  174).
- |2+

- |
  3.6 A time-bound demarcation
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Some authors have maintained that the demarcation between science
- |
  and pseudoscience must be timeless. If this were true, then it would be
- |
  contradictory to label something as pseudoscience at one but not
- |
  another point in time. Hence, after showing that creationism is in some
- |
  respects similar to some doctrines from the early 18th
- |
  century, one author maintained that “if such an activity was
- |
  describable as science then, there is a cause for describing it as
- |
  science now” (Dolby 1987, 207). This argument is based on a
- |
  fundamental misconception of science. It is an essential feature of
- |
  science that it methodically strives for improvement through empirical
- |
  testing, intellectual criticism, and the exploration of new terrain. A
- |
  standpoint or theory cannot be scientific unless it relates adequately
- |
  to this process of improvement, which means as a minimum that
- |
  well-founded rejections of previous scientific standpoints are
- |
  accepted. The demarcation of science cannot be timeless, for the simple
- |
  reason that science itself is not timeless.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Nevertheless, the mutability of science is one of the factors that
- |
  renders the demarcation between science and pseudoscience difficult.
- |
  Derkson (1993, 19) rightly pointed out three major reasons why
- |
  demarcation is sometimes difficult: science changes over time, science
- |
  is heterogenous, and established science itself is not free of the
- |
  defects characteristic of pseudoscience.
- |2+

- |
  4. Alternative demarcation criteria
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Attempts to define what we today call science have a long history,
- |
  and the roots of the demarcation problem have sometimes been traced
- |
  back to Aristotle's Posterior Analytics (Laudan 1983).
- |
  However it was not until the 20th century that influential
- |
  definitions of science have contrasted it against pseudoscience.
- |2+

- |
  4.1 The logical positivists
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Around 1930, the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle developed
- |
  various verificationist approaches to science. The basic idea was that
- |
  a scientific statement could be distinguished from a metaphysical
- |
  statement by being at least in principle possible to verify. This
- |
  standpoint was associated with the view that the meaning of a
- "proposition is its method of verification (see the section on \n"
- |
  Verificationism in the entry on  the
- |2
    Vienna Circle).
- |2
   This proposal has often been included in accounts of the demarcation
- |
  between science and pseudoscience. However, this is not historically
- |
  quite accurate since the verificationist proposals had the aim of
- |
  solving a distinctly different demarcation problem, namely that between
- |
  science and metaphysics.
- |2+

- |
  4.2 Falsificationism
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Popper described the demarcation problem as the “key to most
- |
  of the fundamental problems in the philosophy of science”
- |
  (Popper 1962, 42). He rejected verifiability as a criterion for a
- |
  scientific theory or hypothesis to be scientific, rather than
- |
  pseudoscientific or metaphysical. Instead he proposed as a criterion
- |
  that the theory be falsifiable, or more precisely that
- |
  “statements or systems of statements, in order to be ranked as
- |
  scientific, must be capable of conflicting with possible, or
- |
  conceivable observations” (Popper 1962, 39).
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Popper presented this proposal as a way to draw the line between
- |
  statements belonging to the empirical sciences and “all other
- |
  statements – whether they are of a religious or of a metaphysical
- |
  character, or simply pseudoscientific” (Popper 1962, 39; cf.
- |
  Popper 1974, 981). It was both an alternative to the logical
- |
  positivists’ verification criteria and a criterion for
- |
  distinguishing between science and pseudoscience. Although Popper did
- |
  not emphasize the distinction, these are of course two different
- |
  issues (Bartley 1968). Popper conceded that metaphysical statements
- |
  may be “far from meaningless” (1974, 978–979) but showed no
- |
  such appreciation of pseudoscientific statements.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Popper's demarcation criterion has been criticized both for
- |
  excluding legitimate science (Hansson 2006) and for giving some
- |
  pseudosciences the status of being scientific (Agassi 1991; Mahner
- |
  2007, 518–519). Strictly speaking, his criterion excludes the
- |
  possibility that there can be a pseudoscientific claim that is
- |
  refutable. According to Larry Laudan (1983, 121), it “has the
- |
  untoward consequence of countenancing as ‘scientific’ every
- |
  crank claim which makes ascertainably false assertions”.
- |
  Astrology, rightly taken by Popper as an unusually clear example of a
- |
  pseudoscience, has in fact been tested and thoroughly refuted (Culver
- |
  and Ianna 1988; Carlson 1985). Similarly, the major threats to the
- |
  scientific status of psychoanalysis, another of his major targets, do
- |
  not come from claims that it is untestable but from claims that it has
- |
  been tested and failed the tests.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Defenders of Popper have claimed that this criticism relies on an
- |
  uncharitable interpretation of his ideas. They claim that he should not
- |
  be interpreted as meaning that falsifiability is a sufficient condition
- |
  for demarcating science. Some passages seem to suggest that he takes it
- |
  as only a necessary condition (Feleppa 1990, 142). Other passages
- |
  suggest that for a theory to be scientific, Popper requires (in
- |
  addition to falsifiability) that energetic attempts are made to put the
- |
  theory to test and that negative outcomes of the tests are accepted
- |
  (Cioffi 1985, 14–16). A falsification-based demarcation criterion that
- |
  includes these elements will avoid the most obvious counter-arguments
- |
  to a criterion based on falsifiability alone.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  However, in what seems to be his last statement of his position,
- |
  Popper declared that falsifiability is both a necessary and a
- |
  sufficient criterion. “A sentence (or a theory) is
- |
  empirical-scientific if and only if it is falsifiable”.
- |
  Furthermore, he emphasized that the falsifiability referred to here
- |
  “only has to do with the logical structure of sentences and
- |
  classes of sentences” (Popper [1989] 1994, 82). A (theoretical)
- |
  sentence, he says, is falsifiable if and only if it logically
- |
  contradicts some (empirical) sentence that describes a logically
- |
  possible event that it would be logically possible to observe (Popper
- |
  [1989] 1994, 83). A statement can be falsifiable in this sense although
- |
  it is not in practice possible to falsify it. It would seem to follow
- |
  from this interpretation that a statement's status as scientific
- |
  or non-scientific does not shift with time. On previous occasions he
- |
  seems to have interpreted falsifiability differently, and maintained
- |
  that “what was a metaphysical idea yesterday can become a
- |
  testable scientific theory tomorrow; and this happens
- |
  frequently” (Popper 1974, 981, cf. 984).
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Logical falsifiability is a much weaker criterion than practical
- |
  falsifiability. However, even logical falsifiability can create
- |
  problems in practical demarcations. Popper once adopted the view that
- |
  natural selection is not a proper scientific theory, arguing that it comes
- |
  close to only saying that “survivors survive”, which is
- |
  tautological. “Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory, but
- |
  a metaphysical research program” (Popper 1976, 168). This
- |
  statement has been criticized by evolutionary scientists who pointed
- |
  out that it misrepresents evolution. The theory of natural selection
- |
  has given rise to many predictions that have withstood tests both in
- |
  field studies and in laboratory settings (Ruse 1977; 2000).
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  In a lecture in Darwin College in 1977, Popper retracted his
- |
  previous view that the theory of natural selection is tautological. He
- |
  now admitted that it is a testable theory although “difficult to
- |
  test” (Popper 1978, 344). However, in spite of his well-argued
- |
  recantation his previous standpoint continues to be propagated in
- |
  defiance of the accumulating evidence from empirical tests of natural
- |
  selection.
- |2+

- |
  4.3 The criterion of puzzle-solving
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Thomas Kuhn is one of many philosophers for whom Popper's view
- |
  on the demarcation problem was a starting-point for developing their
- |
  own ideas. Kuhn criticized Popper for characterizing “the entire
- |
  scientific enterprise in terms that apply only to its occasional
- |
  revolutionary parts” (Kuhn 1974, 802). Popper's focus on
- |
  falsifications of theories led to a concentration on the rather rare
- |
  instances when a whole theory is at stake. According to Kuhn, the way
- |
  in which science works on such occasions cannot be used to characterize
- |
  the entire scientific enterprise. Instead it is in “normal
- |
  science”, the science that takes place between the unusual
- |
  moments of scientific revolutions, that we find the characteristics by
- |
  which science can be distinguished from other enterprises (Kuhn 1974,
- |
  801).
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  In normal science, the scientist's activity consists in
- |
  solving puzzles rather than testing fundamental theories. In
- |
  puzzle-solving, current theory is accepted, and the puzzle is indeed defined
- |
  in its terms. In Kuhn's view, “it is normal science, in which
- |
  Sir Karl's sort of testing does not occur, rather than
- |
  extraordinary science which most nearly distinguishes science from
- |
  other enterprises”, and therefore a demarcation criterion must
- |
  refer to the workings of normal science (Kuhn 1974, 802). Kuhn's
- |
  own demarcation criterion is the capability of puzzle-solving that
- |
  he sees as an essential characteristic of normal science.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Kuhn's view of demarcation is most clearly expressed in his
- |
  comparison of astronomy with astrology. Since antiquity, astronomy has
- |
  been a puzzle-solving activity and therefore a science. If an
- |
  astronomer's prediction failed, then this was a puzzle that he
- |
  could hope to solve for instance with more measurements or with
- |
  adjustments of the theory. In contrast, the astrologer had no such
- |
  puzzles since in that discipline “particular failures did not
- |
  give rise to research puzzles, for no man, however skilled, could make
- |
  use of them in a constructive attempt to revise the astrological
- |
  tradition” (Kuhn 1974, 804). Therefore, according to Kuhn,
- |
  astrology has never been a science.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Popper disapproved thoroughly of Kuhn's demarcation criterion.
- |
  According to Popper, astrologers are engaged in puzzle solving, and
- |
  consequently Kuhn's criterion commits him to recognize astrology
- |
  as a science. (Contrary to Kuhn, Popper defined puzzles as “minor
- |
  problems which do not affect the routine”.) In his view
- |
  Kuhn's proposal leads to “the major disaster” of a
- |
  “replacement of a rational criterion of science by a sociological
- |
  one” (Popper 1974, 1146–1147).
- |2+

- |
  4.4 Criteria based on scientific progress
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Popper's demarcation criterion concerns the logical structure
- |
  of theories. Imre Lakatos described this criterion as “a rather
- |
  stunning one. A theory may be scientific even if there is not a shred
- |
  of evidence in its favour, and it may be pseudoscientific even if all
- |
  the available evidence is in its favour. That is, the scientific or
- |
  non-scientific character of a theory can be determined independently of
- |
  the facts” (Lakatos 1981, 117).
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Instead, Lakatos (1970; 1974a; 1974b; 1981) proposed a modification
- |
  of Popper's criterion that he called “sophisticated
- |
  (methodological) falsificationism”. On this view, the demarcation
- |
  criterion should not be applied to an isolated hypothesis or theory but
- |
  rather to a whole research program that is characterized by a series of
- |
  theories successively replacing each other. In his view, a research
- |
  program is progressive if the new theories make surprising predictions
- |
  that are confirmed. In contrast, a degenerating research programme is
- |
  characterized by theories being fabricated only in order to accommodate
- |
  known facts. Progress in science is only possible if a research program
- |
  satisfies the minimum requirement that each new theory that is
- |
  developed in the program has a larger empirical content than its
- |
  predecessor. If a research program does not satisfy this requirement,
- |
  then it is pseudoscientific.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  According to Paul Thagard, a theory or discipline is
- |
  pseudoscientific if it satisfies two criteria. One of these is that the
- |
  theory fails to progress, and the other that “the community of
- |
  practitioners makes little attempt to develop the theory towards
- |
  solutions of the problems, shows no concern for attempts to evaluate
- |
  the theory in relation to others, and is selective in considering
- |
  confirmations and disconfirmations” (Thagard 1978, 228). A major
- |
  difference between his approach and that of Lakatos is that Lakatos
- |
  would classify a nonprogressive discipline as pseudoscientific even if
- |
  its practitioners work hard to improve it and turn it into a
- |
  progressive discipline.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  In a somewhat similar vein, Daniel Rothbart (1990) emphasized the
- |
  distinction between the standards to be used when testing a
- |
  theory and those to be used when determining whether a theory
- |
  should at all be tested. The latter, the eligibility criteria, include
- |
  that the theory should encapsulate the explanatory success of its
- |
  rival, and that it should yield testable implications that are inconsistent
- |
  with those of the rival. According to Rothbart, a theory is
- |
  unscientific if it is not testworthy in this sense.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  George Reisch proposed that demarcation could be based on the
- |
  requirement that a scientific discipline be adequately integrated into
- |
  the other sciences. The various scientific disciplines have strong
- |
  interconnections that are based on methodology, theory, similarity of
- |
  models etc. Creationism, for instance, is not scientific because its
- |
  basic principles and beliefs are incompatible with those that connect
- |
  and unify the sciences. More generally speaking, says Reisch, an
- |
  epistemic field is pseudoscientific if it cannot be incorporated into
- |
  the existing network of established sciences (Reisch 1998; cf. Bunge
- |
  1982, 379).
- |2+

- |
  4.5 Epistemic norms
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  A different approach, namely to base demarcation criteria on the
- |
  value base of science, was proposed by sociologist Robert K. Merton
- |
  ([1942] 1973). According to Merton, science is characterized by an
- |
  “ethos”, i.e. spirit, that can be summarized as four sets
- |
  of institutional imperatives. The first of these,
- |
  universalism, asserts that whatever their origins, truth
- |
  claims should be subjected to preestablished, impersonal criteria. This
- |
  implies that the acceptance or rejection of claims should not depend on
- |
  the personal or social qualities of their protagonists.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The second imperative, communism, says that the substantive
- |
  findings of science are the products of social collaboration and
- |
  therefore belong to the community, rather than being owned by
- |
  individuals or groups. This is, as Merton pointed out, incompatible
- |
  with patents that reserve exclusive rights of use to inventors and
- |
  discoverers. The term “communism” is somewhat infelicitous;
- |
  “communality” probably captures better what Merton aimed
- |
  at.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  His third imperative, disinterestedness, imposes a pattern
- |
  of institutional control that is intended to curb the effects of
- |
  personal or ideological motives that individual scientists may have.
- |
  The fourth imperative, organized scepticism, implies that
- |
  science allows detached scrutiny of beliefs that are dearly held by
- |
  other institutions. This is what sometimes brings science into
- |
  conflicts with religions and other ideologies.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Merton described these criteria as belonging to the sociology of
- |
  science, and thus as empirical statements about norms in actual science
- |
  rather than normative statements about how science should be
- |
  conducted (Merton [1942] 1973, 268). His criteria have often been
- |
  dismissed by sociologists as oversimplified, and they have only had
- |
  limited influence in philosophical discussions on the demarcation
- |
  issue (Dolby 1987; Ruse 2000). Their potential in the latter context
- |
  does not seem to have been sufficiently explored.
- |2+

- |
  4.6 Multi-criterial approaches
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Popper's method of demarcation consists essentially of the
- |
  single criterion of falsifiability (although some authors have wanted
- |
  to combine it with the additional criteria that tests are actually
- |
  performed and their outcomes respected, see Section 4.2). Most of the
- |
  other criteria discussed above are similarly mono-criterial, of course
- |
  with Merton's proposal as a major exception.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Most authors who have proposed demarcation criteria have instead put
- |
  forward a list of such criteria. A large number of lists have been
- |
  published that consist of (usually 5–10) criteria that can be
- |
  used in combination to identify a pseudoscience or pseudoscientific
- |
  practice. This includes lists by Langmuir ([1953] 1989),
- |
  Gruenberger (1964), Dutch (1982), Bunge (1982), Radner and Radner
- |
  (1982), Kitcher (1982, 30–54), Hansson (1983), Grove (1985), Thagard
- |
  (1988), Glymour and Stalker (1990), Derkson (1993, 2001), Vollmer
- |
  (1993), Ruse (1996, 300–306) and Mahner (2007). Many of the criteria
- |
  that appear on such lists relate closely to criteria discussed above in
- |
  Sections 4.2 and 4.4. One such list reads as follows:
- |2+

- |
  Belief in authority: It is contended that some person or
- |
  persons have a special ability to determine what is true or false.
- |
  Others have to accept their judgments.
- |2+

- |
  Unrepeatable experiments: Reliance is put on experiments
- |
  that cannot be repeated by others with the same outcome.
- |2+

- |
  Handpicked examples: Handpicked examples are used
- |
  although they are not representative of the general category that the
- |
  investigation refers to.
- |2+

- |
  Unwillingness to test: A theory is not tested although it
- |
  is possible to test it.
- |2+

- |
  Disregard of refuting information: Observations or
- |
  experiments that conflict with a theory are neglected.
- |2+

- |
  Built-in subterfuge: The testing of a theory is so
- |
  arranged that the theory can only be confirmed, never disconfirmed, by
- |
  the outcome.
- |2+

- |
  Explanations are abandoned without replacement. Tenable
- |
  explanations are given up without being replaced, so that the new
- |
  theory leaves much more unexplained than the previous one. (Hansson
- |
  1983)
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Some of the authors who have proposed multicriterial demarcations
- |
  have defended this approach as being superior to any mono-criterial
- |
  demarcation. Hence, Bunge (1982, 372) asserted that many philosophers
- |
  have failed to provide an adequate definition of science since they
- |
  have presupposed that a single attribute will do; in his view the
- |
  combination several criteria is needed. Dupré (1993, 242)
- |
  proposed that science is best understood as a Wittgensteinian family
- |
  resemblance concept. This would mean that there is a set of features
- |
  that are characteristic of science, but although every part of science
- |
  will have some of these features, we should not expect any part of
- |
  science to have all of them.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  However, a multicriterial definition of science is not needed to
- |
  justify a multicriterial account of how pseudoscience deviates from
- |
  science. Even if science can be characterized by a single defining
- |
  characteristic, different pseudoscientific practices may deviate from
- |
  science in widely divergent ways. Hence, the above-mentioned
- |
  seven-itemed characterization of pseudoscience was proposed as
- |
  representing seven common ways to deviate from a minimal (necessary
- |
  but not sufficient) criterion of science, namely: Science is a
- |
  systematic search for knowledge whose validity does not depend on the
- |
  particular individual but is open for anyone to check or
- |
  rediscover.
- |2+

- |
  5. Unity in diversity
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Kuhn observed that although his own and Popper's criteria of
- |
  demarcation are profoundly different, they lead to essentially the
- |
  same conclusions on what should be counted as science respectively
- |
  pseudoscience (Kuhn 1974, 803). This convergence of theoretically
- |
  divergent demarcation criteria is a quite general phenomenon.
- |
  Philosophers and other theoreticians of science differ widely in their
- |
  views on what science is. Nevertheless, there is virtual unanimity in
- |
  the community of knowledge disciplines on most particular issues of
- |
  demarcation. There is widespread agreement for instance that
- |
  creationism, astrology, homeopathy, Kirlian photography, dowsing,
- |
  ufology, ancient astronaut theory, Holocaust denialism, Velikovskian
- |
  catastrophism, and climate change denialism are pseudosciences. There
- |
  are a few points of controversy, for instance concerning the status of
- |
  Freudian psychoanalysis, but the general picture is one of consensus
- |
  rather than controversy in particular issues of demarcation.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It is in a sense paradoxical that so much agreement has been reached
- |
  in particular issues in spite of almost complete disagreement on the
- |
  general criteria that these judgments should presumably be based upon.
- |
  This puzzle is a sure indication that there is still much important
- |
  philosophical work to be done on the demarcation between science and
- |
  pseudoscience.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Philosophical reflection on pseudoscience has brought forth other
- |
  interesting problem areas in addition to the demarcation between
- |
  science and pseudoscience. Examples include related demarcations such
- |
  as that between science and religion, the relationship between science
- |
  and reliable non-scientific knowledge (for instance everyday
- |
  knowledge), the scope for justifiable simplifications in science
- |
  education and popular science, the nature and justification of
- |
  methodological naturalism in science (Boudry et al 2010), and the
- |
  meaning or meaninglessness of the concept of a supernatural
- |
  phenomenon. Several of these problem areas have as yet not received
- |
  much philosophical attention.

  The demarcation between science and pseudoscience is part of the
- |
  larger task to determine which beliefs are epistemically warranted. The
- |
  entry clarifies the specific nature of pseudoscience in relation to
- |
  other forms of non-scientific doctrines and practices. The major
- |
  proposed demarcation criteria are discussed and some of their
- |
  weaknesses are pointed out. In conclusion, it is emphasized that there
- |
  is much more agreement about particular issues of demarcation than on the
- |
  general criteria that such judgments should be based upon. This is an
- |
  indication that there is still much important philosophical work to be
- |
  done on the demarcation between science and pseudoscience.
- |2+

- |
  Demarcations of science from pseudoscience can be made for both
- |
  theoretical and practical reasons (Mahner 2007, 516). From a
- |
  theoretical point of view, the demarcation issue is an illuminating
- |
  perspective that contributes to the philosophy of science in the same
- |
  way that the study of fallacies contributes to the study of informal
- |
  logic and rational argumentation. From a practical point of view, the
- |
  distinction is important for decision guidance in both private and
- |
  public life. Since science is our most reliable source of knowledge in
- |
  a wide variety of areas, we need to distinguish scientific knowledge
- |
  from its look-alikes. Due to the high status of science in present-day
- |
  society, attempts to exaggerate the scientific status of various
- |
  claims, teachings, and products are common enough to make the
- |
  demarcation issue pressing in many areas. The demarcation issue is
- |
  therefore important in many practical applications such as the
- |
  following:Healthcare: Medical science develops and evaluates
- |
  treatments according to evidence of their effectiveness. Pseudoscientific
- |
  activities in this area give rise to ineffective and sometimes
- |
  dangerous interventions. Healthcare providers, insurers, government
- |
  authorities and – most importantly – patients need
- |
  guidance on how to distinguish between medical science and medical
- |
  pseudoscience.Expert testimony: It is essential for the rule of law
- |
  that courts get the facts right. The reliability of different types of
- |
  evidence must be correctly determined, and expert testimony must be
- |
  based on the best available knowledge. Sometimes it is in the interest
- |
  of litigants to present non-scientific claims as solid science.
- |
  Therefore courts must be able to distinguish between science and
- |
  pseudoscience. Philosophers have often had prominent roles in the
- |
  defence of science against pseudoscience in such contexts. (Hansson
- |
  2011) Environmental policies: In order to be on the safe
- |
  side against potential disasters it may be legitimate to take
- |
  preventive measures when there is valid but yet insufficient evidence
- |
  of an environmental hazard. This must be distinguished from taking
- |
  measures against an alleged hazard for which there is no valid
- |
  evidence at all.  Therefore, decision-makers in environmental policy
- |
  must be able to distinguish between scientific and pseudoscientific
- |
  claims.Science education: The promoters of some
- |
  pseudosciences (notably creationism) try to introduce their teachings
- |
  in school curricula. Teachers and school authorities need to have
- |
  clear criteria of inclusion that protect students against unreliable
- |
  and disproved teachings.
- |2+

- |
  Work on the demarcation problem seems to have waned after Laudan's
- |
  (1983) much noted death certificate according to which there is no
- |
  hope of finding a necessary and sufficient criterion of something as
- |
  heterogeneous as scientific methodology. In more recent years, the
- |
  problem has been revitalized. Philosophers attesting to its vitality
- |
  maintain that the concept can be clarified by other means than a
- |
  necessary and sufficient definition (Pigliucci 2013; Mahner 2013) or
- |
  that such a definition is indeed possible although it has to be
- |
  supplemented with discipline-specific criteria in order to become
- |
  fully operative. (Hansson 2013)
- |2+

- |
  The oldest known use of the word “pseudoscience” dates
- |
  from 1796 when the historian James Pettit Andrew referred to alchemy
- |
  as a “fantastical pseudo-science” (Oxford English
- |
  Dictionary). The word has been in frequent use since the 1880s (Thurs
- |
  and Numbers 2013). Throughout its history the word has had a
- |
  clearly defamatory meaning (Laudan 1983, 119; Dolby 1987, 204). It
- |
  would be as strange for someone to proudly describe her own activities
- |
  as pseudoscience as to boast that they are bad science. Since the
- |
  derogatory connotation is an essential characteristic of the word
- |
  “pseudoscience”, an attempt to extricate a value-free
- |
  definition of the term would not be meaningful. An essentially
- |
  value-laden term has to be defined in value-laden terms. This is often
- |
  difficult since the specification of the value component tends to be
- |
  controversial.
- |2+

- |
  This problem is not specific to pseudoscience but follows directly
- |
  from a parallel but somewhat less conspicuous problem with the concept
- |
  of science. The common usage of the term “science” can be
- |
  described as partly descriptive, partly normative. When an activity is
- |
  recognized as science this usually involves an acknowledgement that it
- |
  has a positive role in our strivings for knowledge. On the other hand
- |
  the concept of science has been formed through a historical process,
- |
  and many contingencies influence what we call and do not call
- |
  science.
- |2+

- |
  Against this background, in order not to be unduly complex a
- |
  definition of science has to go in either of two ways. It can focus on
- |
  the descriptive contents, and specify how the term is actually used.
- |
  Alternatively, it can focus on the normative element, and clarify the
- |
  more fundamental meaning of the term. The latter approach has been the
- |
  choice of most philosophers writing on the subject, and will be at
- |
  focus here. It involves, of necessity, some degree of idealization in
- |
  relation to common usage of the term “science”.
- |2+

- |
  The English word “science” is primarily used about the
- |
  natural sciences and other fields of research that are considered to be
- |
  similar to them. Hence, political economy and sociology are counted as
- |
  sciences, whereas studies of literature and history are usually not.
- |
  The corresponding German word, “Wissenschaft”, has a much
- |
  broader meaning and includes all the academic specialties, including
- |
  the humanities. The German term has the advantage of more adequately
- |
  delimiting of the type of systematic knowledge that is at stake in the
- |
  conflict between science and pseudoscience. The misrepresentations of
- |
  history presented by Holocaust deniers and other pseudo-historians are
- |
  very similar in nature to the misrepresentations of natural science
- |
  promoted by creationists and homeopaths.
- |2+

- |
  More importantly, the natural and social sciences and the humanities
- |
  are all parts of the same human endeavour, namely systematic and
- |
  critical investigations aimed at acquiring the best possible
- |
  understanding of the workings of nature, people, and human
- |
  society. The disciplines that form this community of knowledge
- |
  disciplines are increasingly interdependent (Hansson 2007). Since
- |
  the second half of the 20th century, integrative disciplines such as
- |
  astrophysics, evolutionary biology, biochemistry, ecology, quantum
- |
  chemistry, the neurosciences, and game theory have developed at
- |
  dramatic speed and contributed to tying together previously
- |
  unconnected disciplines. These increased interconnections have also
- |
  linked the sciences and the humanities closer to each other, as can be
- |
  seen for instance from how historical knowledge relies increasingly on
- |
  advanced scientific analysis of archaeological findings.
- |2+

- |
  The conflict between science and pseudoscience is best understood
- |
  with this extended sense of science. On one side of the conflict we
- |
  find the community of knowledge disciplines that includes the natural
- |
  and social sciences and the humanities. On the other side we find a
- |
  wide variety of movements and doctrines, such as creationism,
- |
  astrology, homeopathy, and Holocaust denialism that are in conflict
- |
  with results and methods that are generally accepted in the community
- |
  of knowledge disciplines.
- |2+

- |
  Another way to express this is that the demarcation problem has a
- |
  deeper concern than that of demarcating the selection of human
- |
  activities that we have for various reasons chosen to call
- |
  “sciences”. The ultimate issue is “how to determine
- |
  which beliefs are epistemically warranted” (Fuller 1985,
- |
  331).
- |2+

- |
  The phrases “demarcation of science” and
- |
  “demarcation of science from pseudoscience” are often used
- |
  interchangeably, and many authors seem to have regarded them as equal
- |
  in meaning. In their view the task of drawing the outer boundaries of
- |
  science is essentially the same as that of drawing the boundary between
- |
  science and pseudoscience.
- |2+

- |
  This picture is oversimplified. All non-science is not
- |
  pseudoscience, and science has non-trivial borders to other
- |
  non-scientific phenomena, such as metaphysics, religion, and various
- |
  types of non-scientific systematized knowledge. (Mahner (2007, 548)
- |
  proposed the term “parascience” to cover non-scientific
- |
  practices that are not pseudoscientific.) Science also has the internal
- |
  demarcation problem of distinguishing between good and bad science.
- |2+

- |
  A comparison of the negated terms related to science can contribute
- |
  to clarify the conceptual distinctions. “Unscientific” is a
- |
  narrower concept than “non-scientific” (not scientific),
- |
  since the former but not the latter term implies some form of
- |
  contradiction or conflict with science. “Pseudoscientific”
- |
  is in its turn a narrower concept than “unscientific”. The
- |
  latter term differs from the former in covering inadvertent
- |
  mismeasurements and miscalculations and other forms of bad science
- |
  performed by scientists who are recognized as trying but failing to
- |
  produce good science.
- |2+

- |
  Etymology provides us with an obvious starting-point for clarifying
- |
  what characteristics pseudoscience has in addition to being merely
- |
  non- or un-scientific. “Pseudo-”
- |
  (ψευδο-) means false. In accordance
- |
  with this, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines pseudoscience
- |
  as follows:
- |2+

- |
  Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is
- |
  non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the
- |
  subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title Fads and Fallacies in the
- |
  Name of Science. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438),
- |
  “[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they
- |
  masquerade as genuinely scientific ones.” These and many other
- |
  authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching
- |
  has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996):
- |2+

- |
  The former of these two criteria is central to the concerns of the
- |
  philosophy of science. It has been the subject of important
- |
  controversies among philosophers, to be discussed below in Section 4.
- |
  The second criterion is philosophically less important, but it needs
- |
  careful treatment not least since many discussions of pseudoscience (in
- |
  and out of philosophy) have been confused due to insufficient attention
- |
  to it.
- |2+

- |
  An immediate problem with the definition based on (1) and (2) is
- |
  that it is too wide. There are phenomena that satisfy both criteria but
- |
  are not commonly called pseudoscientific. One of the clearest
- |
  examples of this is fraud in science. This is a practice that has a
- |
  high degree of scientific pretence and yet does not comply with
- |
  science, thus satisfying both criteria. Nevertheless, fraud in
- |
  otherwise legitimate branches of science is seldom if ever called
- |
  “pseudoscience”. The reason for this can be clarified with
- |
  the following hypothetical examples (Hansson 1996).
- |2+

- |
  According to common usage, 1 and 3 are regarded as cases of bad
- |
  science, and only 2 as a case of pseudoscience. What is present in case
- |
  2, but absent in the other two, is a deviant doctrine.
- |
  Isolated breaches of the requirements of science are not commonly
- |
  regarded as pseudoscientific. Pseudoscience, as it is commonly
- |
  conceived, involves a sustained effort to promote teachings different
- |
  from those that have scientific legitimacy at the time.
- |2+

- |
  This explains why fraud in science is not usually regarded as
- |
  pseudoscientific. Such practices are not in general associated with a
- |
  deviant or unorthodox doctrine. To the contrary, the fraudulent
- |
  scientist is anxious that her results be in conformity with the
- |
  predictions of established scientific theories. Deviations from these
- |
  would lead to a much higher risk of disclosure.
- |2+

- |
  The term “science” has both an individuated and an
- |
  unindividuated sense. In the individuated sense, biochemistry and
- |
  astronomy are different sciences, one of which includes
- |
  studies of muscle contraction and the other studies of supernovae. The
- |
  Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines this sense of science as
- |
  “a particular branch of knowledge or study; a recognized
- |
  department of learning”. In the unindividuated sense, the study
- |
  of muscle proteins and that of supernovae are parts of “one and
- |
  the same” science. In the words of the OED, unindividuated
- |
  science is “the kind of knowledge or intellectual activity of
- |
  which the various ‘sciences‘ are examples”.
- |2+

- |
  Pseudoscience is an antithesis of science in the individuated rather
- |
  than the unindividuated sense. There is no unified corpus of
- |
  pseudoscience corresponding to the corpus of science. For a phenomenon
- |
  to be pseudoscientific, it must belong to one or the other of the
- |
  particular pseudosciences. In order to accommodate this feature, the
- |
  above definition can be modified by replacing (2) by the following
- |
  (Hansson 1996):
- |2+

- |
  Most philosophers of science, and most scientists, prefer to regard
- |
  science as constituted by methods of inquiry rather than by particular
- |
  doctrines. There is an obvious tension between (2′) and this
- |
  conventional view of science. This, however, may be as it should since
- |
  pseudoscience often involves a representation of science as a closed
- |
  and finished doctrine rather than as a methodology for open-ended
- |
  inquiry.
- |2+

- |
  Sometimes the term “pseudoscience” is used in a wider
- |
  sense than that which is captured in the definition constituted of (1)
- |
  and (2′). Contrary to (2′), doctrines that conflict with
- |
  science are sometimes called “pseudoscientific” in spite of
- |
  not being advanced as scientific. Hence, Grove (1985, 219) included
- |
  among the pseudoscientific doctrines those that “purport to offer
- |
  alternative accounts to those of science or claim to explain what
- |
  science cannot explain.” Similarly, Lugg (1987, 227–228)
- |
  maintained that “the clairvoyant's predictions are
- |
  pseudoscientific whether or not they are correct”, despite the
- |
  fact that most clairvoyants do not profess to be practitioners of
- |
  science. In this sense, pseudoscience is assumed to include not only
- |
  doctrines contrary to science proclaimed to be scientific but
- |
  doctrines contrary to science tout court, whether or not they
- |
  are put forward in the name of science. To cover this wider sense of
- |
  pseudoscience, (2′) can be modified as follows (Hansson 1996, 2013):
- |2+

- |
  Common usage seems to vacillate between the definitions
- |
  (1)+(2′) and (1)+(2″); and this in an interesting
- |
  way: In their comments on the meaning of the term, critics of
- |
  pseudoscience tend to endorse a definition close to (1)+(2′), but
- |
  their actual usage is often closer to (1)+(2″).
- |2+

- |
  The following examples serve to illustrate the difference between
- |
  the two definitions and also to clarify why clause (1) is needed:
- |2+

- |
  (a) does not satisfy (1), and is therefore not pseudoscientific on
- |
  either account. (b) satisfies (1) but neither (2′) nor
- |
  (2″) and is therefore not pseudoscientific on either
- |
  account. (c) satisfies all three criteria, (1), (2′), and
- |
  (2″), and is therefore pseudoscientific on both accounts.
- |
  Finally, (d) satisfies (1) and (2″) and is therefore
- |
  pseudoscientific according to (1)+(2″) but not according
- |
  to (1)+(2′). As the last two examples illustrate, pseudoscience
- |
  and anti-science are sometimes difficult to distinguish. Promoters of
- |
  some pseudosciences (notably homeopathy) tend to be ambiguous between
- |
  opposition to science and claims that they themselves represent the
- |
  best science.
- |2+

- |
  Various proposals have been put forward on exactly what elements in
- |
  science or pseudoscience criteria of demarcation should be applied to.
- |
  Proposals include that the demarcation should refer to a research
- |
  program (Lakatos 1974a, 248–249), an epistemic field or cognitive
- |
  discipline, i.e. a group of people with common knowledge aims, and
- |
  their practices (Bunge 1982, 2001; Mahner 2007), a theory (Popper
- |
  1962, 1974), a practice (Lugg 1992; Morris 1987), a scientific
- |
  problem or question (Siitonen 1984), and a particular inquiry (Kuhn
- |
  1974; Mayo 1996). It is probably fair to say that demarcation criteria
- |
  can be meaningfully applied on each of these levels of description. A
- |
  much more difficult problem is whether one of these levels is the
- |
  fundamental level to which assessments on the other levels are
- |
  reducible.
- |2+

- |
  Derksen (1993) differs from most other writers on the subject in
- |
  placing the emphasis in demarcation on the pseudoscientist, i.e. the
- |
  individual person conducting pseudoscience. His major argument for this
- |
  is that pseudoscience has scientific pretensions, and such pretensions
- |
  are associated with a person, not a theory, practice or entire field.
- |
  However, as was noted by Settle (1971), it is the rationality and
- |
  critical attitude built into institutions, rather than the personal
- |
  intellectual traits of individuals, that distinguishes science from
- |
  non-scientific practices such as magic. The individual practitioner of
- |
  magic in a pre-literate society is not necessarily less rational than
- |
  the individual scientist in modern Western society. What she lacks is
- |
  an intellectual environment of collective rationality and mutual
- |
  criticism. “It is almost a fallacy of division to insist on each
- |
  individual scientist being critically-minded” (Settle 1971,
- |
  174).
- |2+

- |
  Some authors have maintained that the demarcation between science
- |
  and pseudoscience must be timeless. If this were true, then it would be
- |
  contradictory to label something as pseudoscience at one but not
- |
  another point in time. Hence, after showing that creationism is in some
- |
  respects similar to some doctrines from the early 18th
- |
  century, one author maintained that “if such an activity was
- |
  describable as science then, there is a cause for describing it as
- |
  science now” (Dolby 1987, 207). This argument is based on a
- |
  fundamental misconception of science. It is an essential feature of
- |
  science that it methodically strives for improvement through empirical
- |
  testing, intellectual criticism, and the exploration of new terrain. A
- |
  standpoint or theory cannot be scientific unless it relates adequately
- |
  to this process of improvement, which means as a minimum that
- |
  well-founded rejections of previous scientific standpoints are
- |
  accepted. The demarcation of science cannot be timeless, for the simple
- |
  reason that science itself is not timeless.
- |2+

- |
  Nevertheless, the mutability of science is one of the factors that
- |
  renders the demarcation between science and pseudoscience difficult.
- |
  Derkson (1993, 19) rightly pointed out three major reasons why
- |
  demarcation is sometimes difficult: science changes over time, science
- |
  is heterogenous, and established science itself is not free of the
- |
  defects characteristic of pseudoscience.
- |2+

- |
  Attempts to define what we today call science have a long history,
- |
  and the roots of the demarcation problem have sometimes been traced
- |
  back to Aristotle's Posterior Analytics (Laudan 1983).
- |
  However it was not until the 20th century that influential
- |
  definitions of science have contrasted it against pseudoscience.
- |2+

- |
  Around 1930, the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle developed
- |
  various verificationist approaches to science. The basic idea was that
- |
  a scientific statement could be distinguished from a metaphysical
- |
  statement by being at least in principle possible to verify. This
- |
  standpoint was associated with the view that the meaning of a
- "proposition is its method of verification (see the section on \n"
- |
  Verificationism in the entry on  the
- |2
    Vienna Circle).
- |2
   This proposal has often been included in accounts of the demarcation
- |
  between science and pseudoscience. However, this is not historically
- |
  quite accurate since the verificationist proposals had the aim of
- |
  solving a distinctly different demarcation problem, namely that between
- |
  science and metaphysics.
- |2+

- |
  Popper described the demarcation problem as the “key to most
- |
  of the fundamental problems in the philosophy of science”
- |
  (Popper 1962, 42). He rejected verifiability as a criterion for a
- |
  scientific theory or hypothesis to be scientific, rather than
- |
  pseudoscientific or metaphysical. Instead he proposed as a criterion
- |
  that the theory be falsifiable, or more precisely that
- |
  “statements or systems of statements, in order to be ranked as
- |
  scientific, must be capable of conflicting with possible, or
- |
  conceivable observations” (Popper 1962, 39).
- |2+

- |
  Popper presented this proposal as a way to draw the line between
- |
  statements belonging to the empirical sciences and “all other
- |
  statements – whether they are of a religious or of a metaphysical
- |
  character, or simply pseudoscientific” (Popper 1962, 39; cf.
- |
  Popper 1974, 981). It was both an alternative to the logical
- |
  positivists’ verification criteria and a criterion for
- |
  distinguishing between science and pseudoscience. Although Popper did
- |
  not emphasize the distinction, these are of course two different
- |
  issues (Bartley 1968). Popper conceded that metaphysical statements
- |
  may be “far from meaningless” (1974, 978–979) but showed no
- |
  such appreciation of pseudoscientific statements.
- |2+

- |
  Popper's demarcation criterion has been criticized both for
- |
  excluding legitimate science (Hansson 2006) and for giving some
- |
  pseudosciences the status of being scientific (Agassi 1991; Mahner
- |
  2007, 518–519). Strictly speaking, his criterion excludes the
- |
  possibility that there can be a pseudoscientific claim that is
- |
  refutable. According to Larry Laudan (1983, 121), it “has the
- |
  untoward consequence of countenancing as ‘scientific’ every
- |
  crank claim which makes ascertainably false assertions”.
- |
  Astrology, rightly taken by Popper as an unusually clear example of a
- |
  pseudoscience, has in fact been tested and thoroughly refuted (Culver
- |
  and Ianna 1988; Carlson 1985). Similarly, the major threats to the
- |
  scientific status of psychoanalysis, another of his major targets, do
- |
  not come from claims that it is untestable but from claims that it has
- |
  been tested and failed the tests.
- |2+

- |
  Defenders of Popper have claimed that this criticism relies on an
- |
  uncharitable interpretation of his ideas. They claim that he should not
- |
  be interpreted as meaning that falsifiability is a sufficient condition
- |
  for demarcating science. Some passages seem to suggest that he takes it
- |
  as only a necessary condition (Feleppa 1990, 142). Other passages
- |
  suggest that for a theory to be scientific, Popper requires (in
- |
  addition to falsifiability) that energetic attempts are made to put the
- |
  theory to test and that negative outcomes of the tests are accepted
- |
  (Cioffi 1985, 14–16). A falsification-based demarcation criterion that
- |
  includes these elements will avoid the most obvious counter-arguments
- |
  to a criterion based on falsifiability alone.
- |2+

- |
  However, in what seems to be his last statement of his position,
- |
  Popper declared that falsifiability is both a necessary and a
- |
  sufficient criterion. “A sentence (or a theory) is
- |
  empirical-scientific if and only if it is falsifiable”.
- |
  Furthermore, he emphasized that the falsifiability referred to here
- |
  “only has to do with the logical structure of sentences and
- |
  classes of sentences” (Popper [1989] 1994, 82). A (theoretical)
- |
  sentence, he says, is falsifiable if and only if it logically
- |
  contradicts some (empirical) sentence that describes a logically
- |
  possible event that it would be logically possible to observe (Popper
- |
  [1989] 1994, 83). A statement can be falsifiable in this sense although
- |
  it is not in practice possible to falsify it. It would seem to follow
- |
  from this interpretation that a statement's status as scientific
- |
  or non-scientific does not shift with time. On previous occasions he
- |
  seems to have interpreted falsifiability differently, and maintained
- |
  that “what was a metaphysical idea yesterday can become a
- |
  testable scientific theory tomorrow; and this happens
- |
  frequently” (Popper 1974, 981, cf. 984).
- |2+

- |
  Logical falsifiability is a much weaker criterion than practical
- |
  falsifiability. However, even logical falsifiability can create
- |
  problems in practical demarcations. Popper once adopted the view that
- |
  natural selection is not a proper scientific theory, arguing that it comes
- |
  close to only saying that “survivors survive”, which is
- |
  tautological. “Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory, but
- |
  a metaphysical research program” (Popper 1976, 168). This
- |
  statement has been criticized by evolutionary scientists who pointed
- |
  out that it misrepresents evolution. The theory of natural selection
- |
  has given rise to many predictions that have withstood tests both in
- |
  field studies and in laboratory settings (Ruse 1977; 2000).
- |2+

- |
  In a lecture in Darwin College in 1977, Popper retracted his
- |
  previous view that the theory of natural selection is tautological. He
- |
  now admitted that it is a testable theory although “difficult to
- |
  test” (Popper 1978, 344). However, in spite of his well-argued
- |
  recantation his previous standpoint continues to be propagated in
- |
  defiance of the accumulating evidence from empirical tests of natural
- |
  selection.
- |2+

- |
  Thomas Kuhn is one of many philosophers for whom Popper's view
- |
  on the demarcation problem was a starting-point for developing their
- |
  own ideas. Kuhn criticized Popper for characterizing “the entire
- |
  scientific enterprise in terms that apply only to its occasional
- |
  revolutionary parts” (Kuhn 1974, 802). Popper's focus on
- |
  falsifications of theories led to a concentration on the rather rare
- |
  instances when a whole theory is at stake. According to Kuhn, the way
- |
  in which science works on such occasions cannot be used to characterize
- |
  the entire scientific enterprise. Instead it is in “normal
- |
  science”, the science that takes place between the unusual
- |
  moments of scientific revolutions, that we find the characteristics by
- |
  which science can be distinguished from other enterprises (Kuhn 1974,
- |
  801).
- |2+

- |
  In normal science, the scientist's activity consists in
- |
  solving puzzles rather than testing fundamental theories. In
- |
  puzzle-solving, current theory is accepted, and the puzzle is indeed defined
- |
  in its terms. In Kuhn's view, “it is normal science, in which
- |
  Sir Karl's sort of testing does not occur, rather than
- |
  extraordinary science which most nearly distinguishes science from
- |
  other enterprises”, and therefore a demarcation criterion must
- |
  refer to the workings of normal science (Kuhn 1974, 802). Kuhn's
- |
  own demarcation criterion is the capability of puzzle-solving that
- |
  he sees as an essential characteristic of normal science.
- |2+

- |
  Kuhn's view of demarcation is most clearly expressed in his
- |
  comparison of astronomy with astrology. Since antiquity, astronomy has
- |
  been a puzzle-solving activity and therefore a science. If an
- |
  astronomer's prediction failed, then this was a puzzle that he
- |
  could hope to solve for instance with more measurements or with
- |
  adjustments of the theory. In contrast, the astrologer had no such
- |
  puzzles since in that discipline “particular failures did not
- |
  give rise to research puzzles, for no man, however skilled, could make
- |
  use of them in a constructive attempt to revise the astrological
- |
  tradition” (Kuhn 1974, 804). Therefore, according to Kuhn,
- |
  astrology has never been a science.
- |2+

- |
  Popper disapproved thoroughly of Kuhn's demarcation criterion.
- |
  According to Popper, astrologers are engaged in puzzle solving, and
- |
  consequently Kuhn's criterion commits him to recognize astrology
- |
  as a science. (Contrary to Kuhn, Popper defined puzzles as “minor
- |
  problems which do not affect the routine”.) In his view
- |
  Kuhn's proposal leads to “the major disaster” of a
- |
  “replacement of a rational criterion of science by a sociological
- |
  one” (Popper 1974, 1146–1147).
- |2+

- |
  Popper's demarcation criterion concerns the logical structure
- |
  of theories. Imre Lakatos described this criterion as “a rather
- |
  stunning one. A theory may be scientific even if there is not a shred
- |
  of evidence in its favour, and it may be pseudoscientific even if all
- |
  the available evidence is in its favour. That is, the scientific or
- |
  non-scientific character of a theory can be determined independently of
- |
  the facts” (Lakatos 1981, 117).
- |2+

- |
  Instead, Lakatos (1970; 1974a; 1974b; 1981) proposed a modification
- |
  of Popper's criterion that he called “sophisticated
- |
  (methodological) falsificationism”. On this view, the demarcation
- |
  criterion should not be applied to an isolated hypothesis or theory but
- |
  rather to a whole research program that is characterized by a series of
- |
  theories successively replacing each other. In his view, a research
- |
  program is progressive if the new theories make surprising predictions
- |
  that are confirmed. In contrast, a degenerating research programme is
- |
  characterized by theories being fabricated only in order to accommodate
- |
  known facts. Progress in science is only possible if a research program
- |
  satisfies the minimum requirement that each new theory that is
- |
  developed in the program has a larger empirical content than its
- |
  predecessor. If a research program does not satisfy this requirement,
- |
  then it is pseudoscientific.
- |2+

- |
  According to Paul Thagard, a theory or discipline is
- |
  pseudoscientific if it satisfies two criteria. One of these is that the
- |
  theory fails to progress, and the other that “the community of
- |
  practitioners makes little attempt to develop the theory towards
- |
  solutions of the problems, shows no concern for attempts to evaluate
- |
  the theory in relation to others, and is selective in considering
- |
  confirmations and disconfirmations” (Thagard 1978, 228). A major
- |
  difference between his approach and that of Lakatos is that Lakatos
- |
  would classify a nonprogressive discipline as pseudoscientific even if
- |
  its practitioners work hard to improve it and turn it into a
- |
  progressive discipline.
- |2+

- |
  In a somewhat similar vein, Daniel Rothbart (1990) emphasized the
- |
  distinction between the standards to be used when testing a
- |
  theory and those to be used when determining whether a theory
- |
  should at all be tested. The latter, the eligibility criteria, include
- |
  that the theory should encapsulate the explanatory success of its
- |
  rival, and that it should yield testable implications that are inconsistent
- |
  with those of the rival. According to Rothbart, a theory is
- |
  unscientific if it is not testworthy in this sense.
- |2+

- |
  George Reisch proposed that demarcation could be based on the
- |
  requirement that a scientific discipline be adequately integrated into
- |
  the other sciences. The various scientific disciplines have strong
- |
  interconnections that are based on methodology, theory, similarity of
- |
  models etc. Creationism, for instance, is not scientific because its
- |
  basic principles and beliefs are incompatible with those that connect
- |
  and unify the sciences. More generally speaking, says Reisch, an
- |
  epistemic field is pseudoscientific if it cannot be incorporated into
- |
  the existing network of established sciences (Reisch 1998; cf. Bunge
- |
  1982, 379).
- |2+

- |
  A different approach, namely to base demarcation criteria on the
- |
  value base of science, was proposed by sociologist Robert K. Merton
- |
  ([1942] 1973). According to Merton, science is characterized by an
- |
  “ethos”, i.e. spirit, that can be summarized as four sets
- |
  of institutional imperatives. The first of these,
- |
  universalism, asserts that whatever their origins, truth
- |
  claims should be subjected to preestablished, impersonal criteria. This
- |
  implies that the acceptance or rejection of claims should not depend on
- |
  the personal or social qualities of their protagonists.
- |2+

- |
  The second imperative, communism, says that the substantive
- |
  findings of science are the products of social collaboration and
- |
  therefore belong to the community, rather than being owned by
- |
  individuals or groups. This is, as Merton pointed out, incompatible
- |
  with patents that reserve exclusive rights of use to inventors and
- |
  discoverers. The term “communism” is somewhat infelicitous;
- |
  “communality” probably captures better what Merton aimed
- |
  at.
- |2+

- |
  His third imperative, disinterestedness, imposes a pattern
- |
  of institutional control that is intended to curb the effects of
- |
  personal or ideological motives that individual scientists may have.
- |
  The fourth imperative, organized scepticism, implies that
- |
  science allows detached scrutiny of beliefs that are dearly held by
- |
  other institutions. This is what sometimes brings science into
- |
  conflicts with religions and other ideologies.
- |2+

- |
  Merton described these criteria as belonging to the sociology of
- |
  science, and thus as empirical statements about norms in actual science
- |
  rather than normative statements about how science should be
- |
  conducted (Merton [1942] 1973, 268). His criteria have often been
- |
  dismissed by sociologists as oversimplified, and they have only had
- |
  limited influence in philosophical discussions on the demarcation
- |
  issue (Dolby 1987; Ruse 2000). Their potential in the latter context
- |
  does not seem to have been sufficiently explored.
- |2+

- |
  Popper's method of demarcation consists essentially of the
- |
  single criterion of falsifiability (although some authors have wanted
- |
  to combine it with the additional criteria that tests are actually
- |
  performed and their outcomes respected, see Section 4.2). Most of the
- |
  other criteria discussed above are similarly mono-criterial, of course
- |
  with Merton's proposal as a major exception.
- |2+

- |
  Most authors who have proposed demarcation criteria have instead put
- |
  forward a list of such criteria. A large number of lists have been
- |
  published that consist of (usually 5–10) criteria that can be
- |
  used in combination to identify a pseudoscience or pseudoscientific
- |
  practice. This includes lists by Langmuir ([1953] 1989),
- |
  Gruenberger (1964), Dutch (1982), Bunge (1982), Radner and Radner
- |
  (1982), Kitcher (1982, 30–54), Hansson (1983), Grove (1985), Thagard
- |
  (1988), Glymour and Stalker (1990), Derkson (1993, 2001), Vollmer
- |
  (1993), Ruse (1996, 300–306) and Mahner (2007). Many of the criteria
- |
  that appear on such lists relate closely to criteria discussed above in
- |
  Sections 4.2 and 4.4. One such list reads as follows:
- |2+

- |
  Some of the authors who have proposed multicriterial demarcations
- |
  have defended this approach as being superior to any mono-criterial
- |
  demarcation. Hence, Bunge (1982, 372) asserted that many philosophers
- |
  have failed to provide an adequate definition of science since they
- |
  have presupposed that a single attribute will do; in his view the
- |
  combination several criteria is needed. Dupré (1993, 242)
- |
  proposed that science is best understood as a Wittgensteinian family
- |
  resemblance concept. This would mean that there is a set of features
- |
  that are characteristic of science, but although every part of science
- |
  will have some of these features, we should not expect any part of
- |
  science to have all of them.
- |2+

- |
  However, a multicriterial definition of science is not needed to
- |
  justify a multicriterial account of how pseudoscience deviates from
- |
  science. Even if science can be characterized by a single defining
- |
  characteristic, different pseudoscientific practices may deviate from
- |
  science in widely divergent ways. Hence, the above-mentioned
- |
  seven-itemed characterization of pseudoscience was proposed as
- |
  representing seven common ways to deviate from a minimal (necessary
- |
  but not sufficient) criterion of science, namely: Science is a
- |
  systematic search for knowledge whose validity does not depend on the
- |
  particular individual but is open for anyone to check or
- |
  rediscover.
- |2+

- |
  Kuhn observed that although his own and Popper's criteria of
- |
  demarcation are profoundly different, they lead to essentially the
- |
  same conclusions on what should be counted as science respectively
- |
  pseudoscience (Kuhn 1974, 803). This convergence of theoretically
- |
  divergent demarcation criteria is a quite general phenomenon.
- |
  Philosophers and other theoreticians of science differ widely in their
- |
  views on what science is. Nevertheless, there is virtual unanimity in
- |
  the community of knowledge disciplines on most particular issues of
- |
  demarcation. There is widespread agreement for instance that
- |
  creationism, astrology, homeopathy, Kirlian photography, dowsing,
- |
  ufology, ancient astronaut theory, Holocaust denialism, Velikovskian
- |
  catastrophism, and climate change denialism are pseudosciences. There
- |
  are a few points of controversy, for instance concerning the status of
- |
  Freudian psychoanalysis, but the general picture is one of consensus
- |
  rather than controversy in particular issues of demarcation.
- |2+

- |
  It is in a sense paradoxical that so much agreement has been reached
- |
  in particular issues in spite of almost complete disagreement on the
- |
  general criteria that these judgments should presumably be based upon.
- |
  This puzzle is a sure indication that there is still much important
- |
  philosophical work to be done on the demarcation between science and
- |
  pseudoscience.
- |2+

- |
  Philosophical reflection on pseudoscience has brought forth other
- |
  interesting problem areas in addition to the demarcation between
- |
  science and pseudoscience. Examples include related demarcations such
- |
  as that between science and religion, the relationship between science
- |
  and reliable non-scientific knowledge (for instance everyday
- |
  knowledge), the scope for justifiable simplifications in science
- |
  education and popular science, the nature and justification of
- |
  methodological naturalism in science (Boudry et al 2010), and the
- |
  meaning or meaninglessness of the concept of a supernatural
- |
  phenomenon. Several of these problem areas have as yet not received
- |
  much philosophical attention.

  and Pseudo-ScienceFirst published Wed Sep 3, 2008; substantive revision Mon Feb
  10, 2014\n\n\n\n\n\nThe demarcation between science and pseudoscience is part of
  the\nlarger task to determine which beliefs are epistemically warranted. The\nentry
  clarifies the specific nature of pseudoscience in relation to\nother forms of non-scientific
  doctrines and practices. The major\nproposed demarcation criteria are discussed
  and some of their\nweaknesses are pointed out. In conclusion, it is emphasized that
  there\nis much more agreement about particular issues of demarcation than on the\ngeneral
  criteria that such judgments should be based upon. This is an\nindication that there
  is still much important philosophical work to be\ndone on the demarcation between
  science and pseudoscience.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. The purpose of demarcations\n2. The “science”

  of science from pseudoscience can be made for both\ntheoretical and practical reasons
  (Mahner 2007, 516). From a\ntheoretical point of view, the demarcation issue is
  an illuminating\nperspective that contributes to the philosophy of science in the
  same\nway that the study of fallacies contributes to the study of informal\nlogic
  and rational argumentation. From a practical point of view, the\ndistinction is
  important for decision guidance in both private and\npublic life. Since science
  is our most reliable source of knowledge in\na wide variety of areas, we need to
  distinguish scientific knowledge\nfrom its look-alikes. Due to the high status of
  science in present-day\nsociety, attempts to exaggerate the scientific status of
  various\nclaims, teachings, and products are common enough to make the\ndemarcation
  issue pressing in many areas. The demarcation issue is\ntherefore important in many
  practical applications such as the\nfollowing:\n\nHealthcare: Medical science develops
  and evaluates\ntreatments according to evidence of their effectiveness. Pseudoscientific\nactivities
  in this area give rise to ineffective and sometimes\ndangerous interventions. Healthcare
  providers, insurers, government\nauthorities and – most importantly – patients need\nguidance
  on how to distinguish between medical science and medical\npseudoscience.\n\nExpert
  testimony: It is essential for the rule of law\nthat courts get the facts right.
  The reliability of different types of\nevidence must be correctly determined, and
  expert testimony must be\nbased on the best available knowledge. Sometimes it is
  in the interest\nof litigants to present non-scientific claims as solid science.\nTherefore
  courts must be able to distinguish between science and\npseudoscience. Philosophers
  have often had prominent roles in the\ndefence of science against pseudoscience
  in such contexts. (Hansson\n2011) \n\nEnvironmental policies: In order to be on
  the safe\nside against potential disasters it may be legitimate to take\npreventive
  measures when there is valid but yet insufficient evidence\nof an environmental
  hazard. This must be distinguished from taking\nmeasures against an alleged hazard
  for which there is no valid\nevidence at all.  Therefore, decision-makers in environmental
  policy\nmust be able to distinguish between scientific and pseudoscientific\nclaims.\n\nScience
  education: The promoters of some\npseudosciences (notably creationism) try to introduce
  their teachings\nin school curricula. Teachers and school authorities need to have\nclear
  criteria of inclusion that protect students against unreliable\nand disproved teachings.\n\n\n\nWork
  on the demarcation problem seems to have waned after Laudan's\n(1983) much noted
  death certificate according to which there is no\nhope of finding a necessary and
  sufficient criterion of something as\nheterogeneous as scientific methodology. In
  more recent years, the\nproblem has been revitalized. Philosophers attesting to
  its vitality\nmaintain that the concept can be clarified by other means than a\nnecessary
  and sufficient definition (Pigliucci 2013; Mahner 2013) or\nthat such a definition
  is indeed possible although it has to be\nsupplemented with discipline-specific
  criteria in order to become\nfully operative. (Hansson 2013)\n\n2. The “science”
  of pseudoscience\n\n\n\nThe oldest known use of the word “pseudoscience” dates\nfrom
  1796 when the historian James Pettit Andrew referred to alchemy\nas a “fantastical
  pseudo-science” (Oxford English\nDictionary). The word has been in frequent use
  since the 1880s (Thurs\nand Numbers 2013). Throughout its history the word has had
  a\nclearly defamatory meaning (Laudan 1983, 119; Dolby 1987, 204). It\nwould be
  as strange for someone to proudly describe her own activities\nas pseudoscience
  as to boast that they are bad science. Since the\nderogatory connotation is an essential
  characteristic of the word\n“pseudoscience”, an attempt to extricate a value-free\ndefinition
  of the term would not be meaningful. An essentially\nvalue-laden term has to be
  defined in value-laden terms. This is often\ndifficult since the specification of
  the value component tends to be\ncontroversial.\n\n\n\nThis problem is not specific
  to pseudoscience but follows directly\nfrom a parallel but somewhat less conspicuous
  problem with the concept\nof science. The common usage of the term “science” can
  be\ndescribed as partly descriptive, partly normative. When an activity is\nrecognized
  as science this usually involves an acknowledgement that it\nhas a positive role
  in our strivings for knowledge. On the other hand\nthe concept of science has been
  formed through a historical process,\nand many contingencies influence what we call
  and do not call\nscience.\n\n\n\nAgainst this background, in order not to be unduly
  complex a\ndefinition of science has to go in either of two ways. It can focus on\nthe
  descriptive contents, and specify how the term is actually used.\nAlternatively,
  it can focus on the normative element, and clarify the\nmore fundamental meaning
  of the term. The latter approach has been the\nchoice of most philosophers writing
  on the subject, and will be at\nfocus here. It involves, of necessity, some degree
  of idealization in\nrelation to common usage of the term “science”.\n\n\n\nThe English
  word “science” is primarily used about the\nnatural sciences and other fields of
  research that are considered to be\nsimilar to them. Hence, political economy and
  sociology are counted as\nsciences, whereas studies of literature and history are
  usually not.\nThe corresponding German word, “Wissenschaft”, has a much\nbroader
  meaning and includes all the academic specialties, including\nthe humanities. The
  German term has the advantage of more adequately\ndelimiting of the type of systematic
  knowledge that is at stake in the\nconflict between science and pseudoscience. The
  misrepresentations of\nhistory presented by Holocaust deniers and other pseudo-historians
  are\nvery similar in nature to the misrepresentations of natural science\npromoted
  by creationists and homeopaths.\n\n\n\nMore importantly, the natural and social
  sciences and the humanities\nare all parts of the same human endeavour, namely systematic
  and\ncritical investigations aimed at acquiring the best possible\nunderstanding
  of the workings of nature, people, and human\nsociety. The disciplines that form
  this community of knowledge\ndisciplines are increasingly interdependent (Hansson
  2007). Since\nthe second half of the 20th century, integrative disciplines such
  as\nastrophysics, evolutionary biology, biochemistry, ecology, quantum\nchemistry,
  the neurosciences, and game theory have developed at\ndramatic speed and contributed
  to tying together previously\nunconnected disciplines. These increased interconnections
  have also\nlinked the sciences and the humanities closer to each other, as can be\nseen
  for instance from how historical knowledge relies increasingly on\nadvanced scientific
  analysis of archaeological findings.\n\n\n\nThe conflict between science and pseudoscience
  is best understood\nwith this extended sense of science. On one side of the conflict
  we\nfind the community of knowledge disciplines that includes the natural\nand social
  sciences and the humanities. On the other side we find a\nwide variety of movements
  and doctrines, such as creationism,\nastrology, homeopathy, and Holocaust denialism
  that are in conflict\nwith results and methods that are generally accepted in the
  community\nof knowledge disciplines.\n\n\n\nAnother way to express this is that
  the demarcation problem has a\ndeeper concern than that of demarcating the selection
  of human\nactivities that we have for various reasons chosen to call\n“sciences”.
  The ultimate issue is “how to determine\nwhich beliefs are epistemically warranted”
  (Fuller 1985,\n331).\n\n3. The “pseudo” of pseudoscience\n\n3.1 Non-, un-, and pseudoscience\n\n\n\nThe
  phrases “demarcation of science” and\n“demarcation of science from pseudoscience”
  are often used\ninterchangeably, and many authors seem to have regarded them as
  equal\nin meaning. In their view the task of drawing the outer boundaries of\nscience
  is essentially the same as that of drawing the boundary between\nscience and pseudoscience.\n\n\n\nThis
  picture is oversimplified. All non-science is not\npseudoscience, and science has
  non-trivial borders to other\nnon-scientific phenomena, such as metaphysics, religion,
  and various\ntypes of non-scientific systematized knowledge. (Mahner (2007, 548)\nproposed
  the term “parascience” to cover non-scientific\npractices that are not pseudoscientific.)
  Science also has the internal\ndemarcation problem of distinguishing between good
  and bad science.\n\n\n\nA comparison of the negated terms related to science can
  contribute\nto clarify the conceptual distinctions. “Unscientific” is a\nnarrower
  concept than “non-scientific” (not scientific),\nsince the former but not the latter
  term implies some form of\ncontradiction or conflict with science. “Pseudoscientific”\nis
  in its turn a narrower concept than “unscientific”. The\nlatter term differs from
  the former in covering inadvertent\nmismeasurements and miscalculations and other
  forms of bad science\nperformed by scientists who are recognized as trying but failing
  to\nproduce good science.\n\n\n\nEtymology provides us with an obvious starting-point
  for clarifying\nwhat characteristics pseudoscience has in addition to being merely\nnon-
  or un-scientific. “Pseudo-”\n(ψευδο-) means false. In accordance\nwith this, the
  Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines pseudoscience\nas follows:\n\n“A pretended
  or spurious science; a collection of\nrelated beliefs about the world mistakenly
  regarded as being based on\nscientific method or as having the status that scientific
  truths now\nhave.”\n\n3.2 Non-science posing as science\n\n\n\nMany writers on pseudoscience
  have emphasized that pseudoscience is\nnon-science posing as science. The foremost
  modern classic on the\nsubject (Gardner 1957) bears the title Fads and Fallacies
  in the\nName of Science. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438),\n“[w]hat is objectionable
  about these beliefs is that they\nmasquerade as genuinely scientific ones.” These
  and many other\nauthors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching\nhas
  to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996):\n\n\n(1)\n it is not scientific,
  and\n(2)\nits major proponents try to create the impression that it is\nscientific.
  \n\n\n\n\nThe former of these two criteria is central to the concerns of the\nphilosophy
  of science. It has been the subject of important\ncontroversies among philosophers,
  to be discussed below in Section 4.\nThe second criterion is philosophically less
  important, but it needs\ncareful treatment not least since many discussions of pseudoscience
  (in\nand out of philosophy) have been confused due to insufficient attention\nto
  it.\n\n3.3 The doctrinal component\n\n\n\nAn immediate problem with the definition
  based on (1) and (2) is\nthat it is too wide. There are phenomena that satisfy both
  criteria but\nare not commonly called pseudoscientific. One of the clearest\nexamples
  of this is fraud in science. This is a practice that has a\nhigh degree of scientific
  pretence and yet does not comply with\nscience, thus satisfying both criteria. Nevertheless,
  fraud in\notherwise legitimate branches of science is seldom if ever called\n“pseudoscience”.
  The reason for this can be clarified with\nthe following hypothetical examples (Hansson
  1996).\n\nCase 1: A biochemist performs an experiment that\nshe interprets as showing
  that a particular protein has an essential\nrôle in muscle contraction. There is
  a consensus among her\ncolleagues that the result is a mere artefact, due to experimental\nerror.\n\nCase
  2: A biochemist goes on performing one sloppy\nexperiment after the other. She consistently
  interprets them as showing\nthat a particular protein has a rôle in muscle contraction
  not\naccepted by other scientists.\n\nCase 3: A biochemist performs various sloppy\nexperiments
  in different areas. One is the experiment referred to in\ncase 1. Much of her work
  is of the same quality. She does not propagate\nany particular unorthodox theory.\n\n\n\nAccording
  to common usage, 1 and 3 are regarded as cases of bad\nscience, and only 2 as a
  case of pseudoscience. What is present in case\n2, but absent in the other two,
  is a deviant doctrine.\nIsolated breaches of the requirements of science are not
  commonly\nregarded as pseudoscientific. Pseudoscience, as it is commonly\nconceived,
  involves a sustained effort to promote teachings different\nfrom those that have
  scientific legitimacy at the time.\n\n\n\nThis explains why fraud in science is
  not usually regarded as\npseudoscientific. Such practices are not in general associated
  with a\ndeviant or unorthodox doctrine. To the contrary, the fraudulent\nscientist
  is anxious that her results be in conformity with the\npredictions of established
  scientific theories. Deviations from these\nwould lead to a much higher risk of
  disclosure.\n\n\n\nThe term “science” has both an individuated and an\nunindividuated
  sense. In the individuated sense, biochemistry and\nastronomy are different sciences,
  one of which includes\nstudies of muscle contraction and the other studies of supernovae.
  The\nOxford English Dictionary (OED) defines this sense of science as\n“a particular
  branch of knowledge or study; a recognized\ndepartment of learning”. In the unindividuated
  sense, the study\nof muscle proteins and that of supernovae are parts of “one and\nthe
  same” science. In the words of the OED, unindividuated\nscience is “the kind of
  knowledge or intellectual activity of\nwhich the various ‘sciences‘ are examples”.\n\n\n\nPseudoscience
  is an antithesis of science in the individuated rather\nthan the unindividuated
  sense. There is no unified corpus of\npseudoscience corresponding to the corpus
  of science. For a phenomenon\nto be pseudoscientific, it must belong to one or the
  other of the\nparticular pseudosciences. In order to accommodate this feature, the\nabove
  definition can be modified by replacing (2) by the following\n(Hansson 1996):\n\n\n(2′)\n
  it is part of a\nnon-scientific doctrine whose major proponents try to create the\nimpression
  that it is scientific. \n\n\n\n\nMost philosophers of science, and most scientists,
  prefer to regard\nscience as constituted by methods of inquiry rather than by particular\ndoctrines.
  There is an obvious tension between (2′) and this\nconventional view of science.
  This, however, may be as it should since\npseudoscience often involves a representation
  of science as a closed\nand finished doctrine rather than as a methodology for open-ended\ninquiry.\n\n3.4
  A wider sense of pseudoscience\n\n\n\nSometimes the term “pseudoscience” is used
  in a wider\nsense than that which is captured in the definition constituted of (1)\nand
  (2′). Contrary to (2′), doctrines that conflict with\nscience are sometimes called
  “pseudoscientific” in spite of\nnot being advanced as scientific. Hence, Grove (1985,
  219) included\namong the pseudoscientific doctrines those that “purport to offer\nalternative
  accounts to those of science or claim to explain what\nscience cannot explain.”
  Similarly, Lugg (1987, 227–228)\nmaintained that “the clairvoyant's predictions
  are\npseudoscientific whether or not they are correct”, despite the\nfact that most
  clairvoyants do not profess to be practitioners of\nscience. In this sense, pseudoscience
  is assumed to include not only\ndoctrines contrary to science proclaimed to be scientific
  but\ndoctrines contrary to science tout court, whether or not they\nare put forward
  in the name of science. To cover this wider sense of\npseudoscience, (2′) can be
  modified as follows (Hansson 1996, 2013):\n\n\n(2″)\nit is part of a doctrine whose
  major proponents try to create the\nimpression that it represents the most reliable
  knowledge on its\nsubject matter.\n\n\n\n\nCommon usage seems to vacillate between
  the definitions\n(1)+(2′) and (1)+(2″); and this in an interesting\nway: In their
  comments on the meaning of the term, critics of\npseudoscience tend to endorse a
  definition close to (1)+(2′), but\ntheir actual usage is often closer to (1)+(2″).\n\n\n\nThe
  following examples serve to illustrate the difference between\nthe two definitions
  and also to clarify why clause (1) is needed:\n\nA creationist book gives a correct
  account of the structure of\nDNA.\n\nAn otherwise reliable chemistry book gives
  an incorrect account of\nthe structure of DNA.\n\nA creationist book denies that
  the human species shares common\nancestors with other primates.\n\nA preacher who
  denies that science can be trusted also\ndenies that the human species shares common
  ancestors with other\nprimates.\n\n\n\n(a) does not satisfy (1), and is therefore
  not pseudoscientific on\neither account. (b) satisfies (1) but neither (2′) nor\n(2″)
  and is therefore not pseudoscientific on either\naccount. (c) satisfies all three
  criteria, (1), (2′), and\n(2″), and is therefore pseudoscientific on both accounts.\nFinally,
  (d) satisfies (1) and (2″) and is therefore\npseudoscientific according to (1)+(2″)
  but not according\nto (1)+(2′). As the last two examples illustrate, pseudoscience\nand
  anti-science are sometimes difficult to distinguish. Promoters of\nsome pseudosciences
  (notably homeopathy) tend to be ambiguous between\nopposition to science and claims
  that they themselves represent the\nbest science.\n\n3.5 The objects of demarcation\n\n\n\nVarious
  proposals have been put forward on exactly what elements in\nscience or pseudoscience
  criteria of demarcation should be applied to.\nProposals include that the demarcation
  should refer to a research\nprogram (Lakatos 1974a, 248–249), an epistemic field
  or cognitive\ndiscipline, i.e. a group of people with common knowledge aims, and\ntheir
  practices (Bunge 1982, 2001; Mahner 2007), a theory (Popper\n1962, 1974), a practice
  (Lugg 1992; Morris 1987), a scientific\nproblem or question (Siitonen 1984), and
  a particular inquiry (Kuhn\n1974; Mayo 1996). It is probably fair to say that demarcation
  criteria\ncan be meaningfully applied on each of these levels of description. A\nmuch
  more difficult problem is whether one of these levels is the\nfundamental level
  to which assessments on the other levels are\nreducible.\n\n\n\nDerksen (1993) differs
  from most other writers on the subject in\nplacing the emphasis in demarcation on
  the pseudoscientist, i.e. the\nindividual person conducting pseudoscience. His major
  argument for this\nis that pseudoscience has scientific pretensions, and such pretensions\nare
  associated with a person, not a theory, practice or entire field.\nHowever, as was
  noted by Settle (1971), it is the rationality and\ncritical attitude built into
  institutions, rather than the personal\nintellectual traits of individuals, that
  distinguishes science from\nnon-scientific practices such as magic. The individual
  practitioner of\nmagic in a pre-literate society is not necessarily less rational
  than\nthe individual scientist in modern Western society. What she lacks is\nan
  intellectual environment of collective rationality and mutual\ncriticism. “It is
  almost a fallacy of division to insist on each\nindividual scientist being critically-minded”
  (Settle 1971,\n174).\n\n3.6 A time-bound demarcation\n\n\n\nSome authors have maintained
  that the demarcation between science\nand pseudoscience must be timeless. If this
  were true, then it would be\ncontradictory to label something as pseudoscience at
  one but not\nanother point in time. Hence, after showing that creationism is in
  some\nrespects similar to some doctrines from the early 18th\ncentury, one author
  maintained that “if such an activity was\ndescribable as science then, there is
  a cause for describing it as\nscience now” (Dolby 1987, 207). This argument is based
  on a\nfundamental misconception of science. It is an essential feature of\nscience
  that it methodically strives for improvement through empirical\ntesting, intellectual
  criticism, and the exploration of new terrain. A\nstandpoint or theory cannot be
  scientific unless it relates adequately\nto this process of improvement, which means
  as a minimum that\nwell-founded rejections of previous scientific standpoints are\naccepted.
  The demarcation of science cannot be timeless, for the simple\nreason that science
  itself is not timeless.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, the mutability of science is one of
  the factors that\nrenders the demarcation between science and pseudoscience difficult.\nDerkson
  (1993, 19) rightly pointed out three major reasons why\ndemarcation is sometimes
  difficult: science changes over time, science\nis heterogenous, and established
  science itself is not free of the\ndefects characteristic of pseudoscience.\n\n4.
  Alternative demarcation criteria\n\n\n\nAttempts to define what we today call science
  have a long history,\nand the roots of the demarcation problem have sometimes been
  traced\nback to Aristotle's Posterior Analytics (Laudan 1983).\nHowever it was not
  until the 20th century that influential\ndefinitions of science have contrasted
  it against pseudoscience.\n\n4.1 The logical positivists\n\n\n\nAround 1930, the
  logical positivists of the Vienna Circle developed\nvarious verificationist approaches
  to science. The basic idea was that\na scientific statement could be distinguished
  from a metaphysical\nstatement by being at least in principle possible to verify.
  This\nstandpoint was associated with the view that the meaning of a\nproposition
  is its method of verification (see the section on \nVerificationism in the entry
  on  the\n  Vienna Circle).\n This proposal has often been included in accounts of
  the demarcation\nbetween science and pseudoscience. However, this is not historically\nquite
  accurate since the verificationist proposals had the aim of\nsolving a distinctly
  different demarcation problem, namely that between\nscience and metaphysics.\n\n4.2
  Falsificationism\n\n\n\nPopper described the demarcation problem as the “key to
  most\nof the fundamental problems in the philosophy of science”\n(Popper 1962, 42).
  He rejected verifiability as a criterion for a\nscientific theory or hypothesis
  to be scientific, rather than\npseudoscientific or metaphysical. Instead he proposed
  as a criterion\nthat the theory be falsifiable, or more precisely that\n“statements
  or systems of statements, in order to be ranked as\nscientific, must be capable
  of conflicting with possible, or\nconceivable observations” (Popper 1962, 39).\n\n\n\nPopper
  presented this proposal as a way to draw the line between\nstatements belonging
  to the empirical sciences and “all other\nstatements – whether they are of a religious
  or of a metaphysical\ncharacter, or simply pseudoscientific” (Popper 1962, 39; cf.\nPopper
  1974, 981). It was both an alternative to the logical\npositivists’ verification
  criteria and a criterion for\ndistinguishing between science and pseudoscience.
  Although Popper did\nnot emphasize the distinction, these are of course two different\nissues
  (Bartley 1968). Popper conceded that metaphysical statements\nmay be “far from meaningless”
  (1974, 978–979) but showed no\nsuch appreciation of pseudoscientific statements.\n\n\n\nPopper's
  demarcation criterion has been criticized both for\nexcluding legitimate science
  (Hansson 2006) and for giving some\npseudosciences the status of being scientific
  (Agassi 1991; Mahner\n2007, 518–519). Strictly speaking, his criterion excludes
  the\npossibility that there can be a pseudoscientific claim that is\nrefutable.
  According to Larry Laudan (1983, 121), it “has the\nuntoward consequence of countenancing
  as ‘scientific’ every\ncrank claim which makes ascertainably false assertions”.\nAstrology,
  rightly taken by Popper as an unusually clear example of a\npseudoscience, has in
  fact been tested and thoroughly refuted (Culver\nand Ianna 1988; Carlson 1985).
  Similarly, the major threats to the\nscientific status of psychoanalysis, another
  of his major targets, do\nnot come from claims that it is untestable but from claims
  that it has\nbeen tested and failed the tests.\n\n\n\nDefenders of Popper have claimed
  that this criticism relies on an\nuncharitable interpretation of his ideas. They
  claim that he should not\nbe interpreted as meaning that falsifiability is a sufficient
  condition\nfor demarcating science. Some passages seem to suggest that he takes
  it\nas only a necessary condition (Feleppa 1990, 142). Other passages\nsuggest that
  for a theory to be scientific, Popper requires (in\naddition to falsifiability)
  that energetic attempts are made to put the\ntheory to test and that negative outcomes
  of the tests are accepted\n(Cioffi 1985, 14–16). A falsification-based demarcation
  criterion that\nincludes these elements will avoid the most obvious counter-arguments\nto
  a criterion based on falsifiability alone.\n\n\n\nHowever, in what seems to be his
  last statement of his position,\nPopper declared that falsifiability is both a necessary
  and a\nsufficient criterion. “A sentence (or a theory) is\nempirical-scientific
  if and only if it is falsifiable”.\nFurthermore, he emphasized that the falsifiability
  referred to here\n“only has to do with the logical structure of sentences and\nclasses
  of sentences” (Popper [1989] 1994, 82). A (theoretical)\nsentence, he says, is falsifiable
  if and only if it logically\ncontradicts some (empirical) sentence that describes
  a logically\npossible event that it would be logically possible to observe (Popper\n[1989]
  1994, 83). A statement can be falsifiable in this sense although\nit is not in practice
  possible to falsify it. It would seem to follow\nfrom this interpretation that a
  statement's status as scientific\nor non-scientific does not shift with time. On
  previous occasions he\nseems to have interpreted falsifiability differently, and
  maintained\nthat “what was a metaphysical idea yesterday can become a\ntestable
  scientific theory tomorrow; and this happens\nfrequently” (Popper 1974, 981, cf.
  984).\n\n\n\nLogical falsifiability is a much weaker criterion than practical\nfalsifiability.
  However, even logical falsifiability can create\nproblems in practical demarcations.
  Popper once adopted the view that\nnatural selection is not a proper scientific
  theory, arguing that it comes\nclose to only saying that “survivors survive”, which
  is\ntautological. “Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory, but\na metaphysical
  research program” (Popper 1976, 168). This\nstatement has been criticized by evolutionary
  scientists who pointed\nout that it misrepresents evolution. The theory of natural
  selection\nhas given rise to many predictions that have withstood tests both in\nfield
  studies and in laboratory settings (Ruse 1977; 2000).\n\n\n\nIn a lecture in Darwin
  College in 1977, Popper retracted his\nprevious view that the theory of natural
  selection is tautological. He\nnow admitted that it is a testable theory although
  “difficult to\ntest” (Popper 1978, 344). However, in spite of his well-argued\nrecantation
  his previous standpoint continues to be propagated in\ndefiance of the accumulating
  evidence from empirical tests of natural\nselection.\n\n4.3 The criterion of puzzle-solving\n\n\n\nThomas
  Kuhn is one of many philosophers for whom Popper's view\non the demarcation problem
  was a starting-point for developing their\nown ideas. Kuhn criticized Popper for
  characterizing “the entire\nscientific enterprise in terms that apply only to its
  occasional\nrevolutionary parts” (Kuhn 1974, 802). Popper's focus on\nfalsifications
  of theories led to a concentration on the rather rare\ninstances when a whole theory
  is at stake. According to Kuhn, the way\nin which science works on such occasions
  cannot be used to characterize\nthe entire scientific enterprise. Instead it is
  in “normal\nscience”, the science that takes place between the unusual\nmoments
  of scientific revolutions, that we find the characteristics by\nwhich science can
  be distinguished from other enterprises (Kuhn 1974,\n801).\n\n\n\nIn normal science,
  the scientist's activity consists in\nsolving puzzles rather than testing fundamental
  theories. In\npuzzle-solving, current theory is accepted, and the puzzle is indeed
  defined\nin its terms. In Kuhn's view, “it is normal science, in which\nSir Karl's
  sort of testing does not occur, rather than\nextraordinary science which most nearly
  distinguishes science from\nother enterprises”, and therefore a demarcation criterion
  must\nrefer to the workings of normal science (Kuhn 1974, 802). Kuhn's\nown demarcation
  criterion is the capability of puzzle-solving that\nhe sees as an essential characteristic
  of normal science.\n\n\n\nKuhn's view of demarcation is most clearly expressed in
  his\ncomparison of astronomy with astrology. Since antiquity, astronomy has\nbeen
  a puzzle-solving activity and therefore a science. If an\nastronomer's prediction
  failed, then this was a puzzle that he\ncould hope to solve for instance with more
  measurements or with\nadjustments of the theory. In contrast, the astrologer had
  no such\npuzzles since in that discipline “particular failures did not\ngive rise
  to research puzzles, for no man, however skilled, could make\nuse of them in a constructive
  attempt to revise the astrological\ntradition” (Kuhn 1974, 804). Therefore, according
  to Kuhn,\nastrology has never been a science.\n\n\n\nPopper disapproved thoroughly
  of Kuhn's demarcation criterion.\nAccording to Popper, astrologers are engaged in
  puzzle solving, and\nconsequently Kuhn's criterion commits him to recognize astrology\nas
  a science. (Contrary to Kuhn, Popper defined puzzles as “minor\nproblems which do
  not affect the routine”.) In his view\nKuhn's proposal leads to “the major disaster”
  of a\n“replacement of a rational criterion of science by a sociological\none” (Popper
  1974, 1146–1147).\n\n4.4 Criteria based on scientific progress\n\n\n\nPopper's demarcation
  criterion concerns the logical structure\nof theories. Imre Lakatos described this
  criterion as “a rather\nstunning one. A theory may be scientific even if there is
  not a shred\nof evidence in its favour, and it may be pseudoscientific even if all\nthe
  available evidence is in its favour. That is, the scientific or\nnon-scientific
  character of a theory can be determined independently of\nthe facts” (Lakatos 1981,
  117).\n\n\n\nInstead, Lakatos (1970; 1974a; 1974b; 1981) proposed a modification\nof
  Popper's criterion that he called “sophisticated\n(methodological) falsificationism”.
  On this view, the demarcation\ncriterion should not be applied to an isolated hypothesis
  or theory but\nrather to a whole research program that is characterized by a series
  of\ntheories successively replacing each other. In his view, a research\nprogram
  is progressive if the new theories make surprising predictions\nthat are confirmed.
  In contrast, a degenerating research programme is\ncharacterized by theories being
  fabricated only in order to accommodate\nknown facts. Progress in science is only
  possible if a research program\nsatisfies the minimum requirement that each new
  theory that is\ndeveloped in the program has a larger empirical content than its\npredecessor.
  If a research program does not satisfy this requirement,\nthen it is pseudoscientific.\n\n\n\nAccording
  to Paul Thagard, a theory or discipline is\npseudoscientific if it satisfies two
  criteria. One of these is that the\ntheory fails to progress, and the other that
  “the community of\npractitioners makes little attempt to develop the theory towards\nsolutions
  of the problems, shows no concern for attempts to evaluate\nthe theory in relation
  to others, and is selective in considering\nconfirmations and disconfirmations”
  (Thagard 1978, 228). A major\ndifference between his approach and that of Lakatos
  is that Lakatos\nwould classify a nonprogressive discipline as pseudoscientific
  even if\nits practitioners work hard to improve it and turn it into a\nprogressive
  discipline.\n\n\n\nIn a somewhat similar vein, Daniel Rothbart (1990) emphasized
  the\ndistinction between the standards to be used when testing a\ntheory and those
  to be used when determining whether a theory\nshould at all be tested. The latter,
  the eligibility criteria, include\nthat the theory should encapsulate the explanatory
  success of its\nrival, and that it should yield testable implications that are inconsistent\nwith
  those of the rival. According to Rothbart, a theory is\nunscientific if it is not
  testworthy in this sense.\n\n\n\nGeorge Reisch proposed that demarcation could be
  based on the\nrequirement that a scientific discipline be adequately integrated
  into\nthe other sciences. The various scientific disciplines have strong\ninterconnections
  that are based on methodology, theory, similarity of\nmodels etc. Creationism, for
  instance, is not scientific because its\nbasic principles and beliefs are incompatible
  with those that connect\nand unify the sciences. More generally speaking, says Reisch,
  an\nepistemic field is pseudoscientific if it cannot be incorporated into\nthe existing
  network of established sciences (Reisch 1998; cf. Bunge\n1982, 379).\n\n4.5 Epistemic
  norms\n\n\n\nA different approach, namely to base demarcation criteria on the\nvalue
  base of science, was proposed by sociologist Robert K. Merton\n([1942] 1973). According
  to Merton, science is characterized by an\n“ethos”, i.e. spirit, that can be summarized
  as four sets\nof institutional imperatives. The first of these,\nuniversalism, asserts
  that whatever their origins, truth\nclaims should be subjected to preestablished,
  impersonal criteria. This\nimplies that the acceptance or rejection of claims should
  not depend on\nthe personal or social qualities of their protagonists.\n\n\n\nThe
  second imperative, communism, says that the substantive\nfindings of science are
  the products of social collaboration and\ntherefore belong to the community, rather
  than being owned by\nindividuals or groups. This is, as Merton pointed out, incompatible\nwith
  patents that reserve exclusive rights of use to inventors and\ndiscoverers. The
  term “communism” is somewhat infelicitous;\n“communality” probably captures better
  what Merton aimed\nat.\n\n\n\nHis third imperative, disinterestedness, imposes a
  pattern\nof institutional control that is intended to curb the effects of\npersonal
  or ideological motives that individual scientists may have.\nThe fourth imperative,
  organized scepticism, implies that\nscience allows detached scrutiny of beliefs
  that are dearly held by\nother institutions. This is what sometimes brings science
  into\nconflicts with religions and other ideologies.\n\n\n\nMerton described these
  criteria as belonging to the sociology of\nscience, and thus as empirical statements
  about norms in actual science\nrather than normative statements about how science
  should be\nconducted (Merton [1942] 1973, 268). His criteria have often been\ndismissed
  by sociologists as oversimplified, and they have only had\nlimited influence in
  philosophical discussions on the demarcation\nissue (Dolby 1987; Ruse 2000). Their
  potential in the latter context\ndoes not seem to have been sufficiently explored.\n\n4.6
  Multi-criterial approaches\n\n\n\nPopper's method of demarcation consists essentially
  of the\nsingle criterion of falsifiability (although some authors have wanted\nto
  combine it with the additional criteria that tests are actually\nperformed and their
  outcomes respected, see Section 4.2). Most of the\nother criteria discussed above
  are similarly mono-criterial, of course\nwith Merton's proposal as a major exception.\n\n\n\nMost
  authors who have proposed demarcation criteria have instead put\nforward a list
  of such criteria. A large number of lists have been\npublished that consist of (usually
  5–10) criteria that can be\nused in combination to identify a pseudoscience or pseudoscientific\npractice.
  This includes lists by Langmuir ([1953] 1989),\nGruenberger (1964), Dutch (1982),
  Bunge (1982), Radner and Radner\n(1982), Kitcher (1982, 30–54), Hansson (1983),
  Grove (1985), Thagard\n(1988), Glymour and Stalker (1990), Derkson (1993, 2001),
  Vollmer\n(1993), Ruse (1996, 300–306) and Mahner (2007). Many of the criteria\nthat
  appear on such lists relate closely to criteria discussed above in\nSections 4.2
  and 4.4. One such list reads as follows:\n\nBelief in authority: It is contended
  that some person or\npersons have a special ability to determine what is true or
  false.\nOthers have to accept their judgments.\n\nUnrepeatable experiments: Reliance
  is put on experiments\nthat cannot be repeated by others with the same outcome.\n\nHandpicked
  examples: Handpicked examples are used\nalthough they are not representative of
  the general category that the\ninvestigation refers to.\n\nUnwillingness to test:
  A theory is not tested although it\nis possible to test it.\n\nDisregard of refuting
  information: Observations or\nexperiments that conflict with a theory are neglected.\n\nBuilt-in
  subterfuge: The testing of a theory is so\narranged that the theory can only be
  confirmed, never disconfirmed, by\nthe outcome.\n\nExplanations are abandoned without
  replacement. Tenable\nexplanations are given up without being replaced, so that
  the new\ntheory leaves much more unexplained than the previous one. (Hansson\n1983)\n\n\n\nSome
  of the authors who have proposed multicriterial demarcations\nhave defended this
  approach as being superior to any mono-criterial\ndemarcation. Hence, Bunge (1982,
  372) asserted that many philosophers\nhave failed to provide an adequate definition
  of science since they\nhave presupposed that a single attribute will do; in his
  view the\ncombination several criteria is needed. Dupré (1993, 242)\nproposed that
  science is best understood as a Wittgensteinian family\nresemblance concept. This
  would mean that there is a set of features\nthat are characteristic of science,
  but although every part of science\nwill have some of these features, we should
  not expect any part of\nscience to have all of them.\n\n\n\nHowever, a multicriterial
  definition of science is not needed to\njustify a multicriterial account of how
  pseudoscience deviates from\nscience. Even if science can be characterized by a
  single defining\ncharacteristic, different pseudoscientific practices may deviate
  from\nscience in widely divergent ways. Hence, the above-mentioned\nseven-itemed
  characterization of pseudoscience was proposed as\nrepresenting seven common ways
  to deviate from a minimal (necessary\nbut not sufficient) criterion of science,
  namely: Science is a\nsystematic search for knowledge whose validity does not depend
  on the\nparticular individual but is open for anyone to check or\nrediscover.\n\n5.
  Unity in diversity\n\n\n\nKuhn observed that although his own and Popper's criteria
  of\ndemarcation are profoundly different, they lead to essentially the\nsame conclusions
  on what should be counted as science respectively\npseudoscience (Kuhn 1974, 803).
  This convergence of theoretically\ndivergent demarcation criteria is a quite general
  phenomenon.\nPhilosophers and other theoreticians of science differ widely in their\nviews
  on what science is. Nevertheless, there is virtual unanimity in\nthe community of
  knowledge disciplines on most particular issues of\ndemarcation. There is widespread
  agreement for instance that\ncreationism, astrology, homeopathy, Kirlian photography,
  dowsing,\nufology, ancient astronaut theory, Holocaust denialism, Velikovskian\ncatastrophism,
  and climate change denialism are pseudosciences. There\nare a few points of controversy,
  for instance concerning the status of\nFreudian psychoanalysis, but the general
  picture is one of consensus\nrather than controversy in particular issues of demarcation.\n\n\n\nIt
  is in a sense paradoxical that so much agreement has been reached\nin particular
  issues in spite of almost complete disagreement on the\ngeneral criteria that these
  judgments should presumably be based upon.\nThis puzzle is a sure indication that
  there is still much important\nphilosophical work to be done on the demarcation
  between science and\npseudoscience.\n\n\n\nPhilosophical reflection on pseudoscience
  has brought forth other\ninteresting problem areas in addition to the demarcation
  between\nscience and pseudoscience. Examples include related demarcations such\nas
  that between science and religion, the relationship between science\nand reliable
  non-scientific knowledge (for instance everyday\nknowledge), the scope for justifiable
  simplifications in science\neducation and popular science, the nature and justification
  of\nmethodological naturalism in science (Boudry et al 2010), and the\nmeaning or
  meaninglessness of the concept of a supernatural\nphenomenon. Several of these problem
  areas have as yet not received\nmuch philosophical attention.\n\n\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\nCited

  demarcation between science and pseudoscience is part of the\nlarger task to determine
  which beliefs are epistemically warranted. The\nentry clarifies the specific nature
  of pseudoscience in relation to\nother forms of non-scientific doctrines and practices.
  The major\nproposed demarcation criteria are discussed and some of their\nweaknesses
  are pointed out. In conclusion, it is emphasized that there\nis much more agreement
  about particular issues of demarcation than on the\ngeneral criteria that such judgments
  should be based upon. This is an\nindication that there is still much important
  philosophical work to be\ndone on the demarcation between science and pseudoscience.\n\nDemarcations
  of science from pseudoscience can be made for both\ntheoretical and practical reasons
  (Mahner 2007, 516). From a\ntheoretical point of view, the demarcation issue is
  an illuminating\nperspective that contributes to the philosophy of science in the
  same\nway that the study of fallacies contributes to the study of informal\nlogic
  and rational argumentation. From a practical point of view, the\ndistinction is
  important for decision guidance in both private and\npublic life. Since science
  is our most reliable source of knowledge in\na wide variety of areas, we need to
  distinguish scientific knowledge\nfrom its look-alikes. Due to the high status of
  science in present-day\nsociety, attempts to exaggerate the scientific status of
  various\nclaims, teachings, and products are common enough to make the\ndemarcation
  issue pressing in many areas. The demarcation issue is\ntherefore important in many
  practical applications such as the\nfollowing:Healthcare: Medical science develops
  and evaluates\ntreatments according to evidence of their effectiveness. Pseudoscientific\nactivities
  in this area give rise to ineffective and sometimes\ndangerous interventions. Healthcare
  providers, insurers, government\nauthorities and – most importantly – patients need\nguidance
  on how to distinguish between medical science and medical\npseudoscience.Expert
  testimony: It is essential for the rule of law\nthat courts get the facts right.
  The reliability of different types of\nevidence must be correctly determined, and
  expert testimony must be\nbased on the best available knowledge. Sometimes it is
  in the interest\nof litigants to present non-scientific claims as solid science.\nTherefore
  courts must be able to distinguish between science and\npseudoscience. Philosophers
  have often had prominent roles in the\ndefence of science against pseudoscience
  in such contexts. (Hansson\n2011) Environmental policies: In order to be on the
  safe\nside against potential disasters it may be legitimate to take\npreventive
  measures when there is valid but yet insufficient evidence\nof an environmental
  hazard. This must be distinguished from taking\nmeasures against an alleged hazard
  for which there is no valid\nevidence at all.  Therefore, decision-makers in environmental
  policy\nmust be able to distinguish between scientific and pseudoscientific\nclaims.Science
  education: The promoters of some\npseudosciences (notably creationism) try to introduce
  their teachings\nin school curricula. Teachers and school authorities need to have\nclear
  criteria of inclusion that protect students against unreliable\nand disproved teachings.\n\nWork
  on the demarcation problem seems to have waned after Laudan's\n(1983) much noted
  death certificate according to which there is no\nhope of finding a necessary and
  sufficient criterion of something as\nheterogeneous as scientific methodology. In
  more recent years, the\nproblem has been revitalized. Philosophers attesting to
  its vitality\nmaintain that the concept can be clarified by other means than a\nnecessary
  and sufficient definition (Pigliucci 2013; Mahner 2013) or\nthat such a definition
  is indeed possible although it has to be\nsupplemented with discipline-specific
  criteria in order to become\nfully operative. (Hansson 2013)\n\nThe oldest known
  use of the word “pseudoscience” dates\nfrom 1796 when the historian James Pettit
  Andrew referred to alchemy\nas a “fantastical pseudo-science” (Oxford English\nDictionary).
  The word has been in frequent use since the 1880s (Thurs\nand Numbers 2013). Throughout
  its history the word has had a\nclearly defamatory meaning (Laudan 1983, 119; Dolby
  1987, 204). It\nwould be as strange for someone to proudly describe her own activities\nas
  pseudoscience as to boast that they are bad science. Since the\nderogatory connotation
  is an essential characteristic of the word\n“pseudoscience”, an attempt to extricate
  a value-free\ndefinition of the term would not be meaningful. An essentially\nvalue-laden
  term has to be defined in value-laden terms. This is often\ndifficult since the
  specification of the value component tends to be\ncontroversial.\n\nThis problem
  is not specific to pseudoscience but follows directly\nfrom a parallel but somewhat
  less conspicuous problem with the concept\nof science. The common usage of the term
  “science” can be\ndescribed as partly descriptive, partly normative. When an activity
  is\nrecognized as science this usually involves an acknowledgement that it\nhas
  a positive role in our strivings for knowledge. On the other hand\nthe concept of
  science has been formed through a historical process,\nand many contingencies influence
  what we call and do not call\nscience.\n\nAgainst this background, in order not
  to be unduly complex a\ndefinition of science has to go in either of two ways. It
  can focus on\nthe descriptive contents, and specify how the term is actually used.\nAlternatively,
  it can focus on the normative element, and clarify the\nmore fundamental meaning
  of the term. The latter approach has been the\nchoice of most philosophers writing
  on the subject, and will be at\nfocus here. It involves, of necessity, some degree
  of idealization in\nrelation to common usage of the term “science”.\n\nThe English
  word “science” is primarily used about the\nnatural sciences and other fields of
  research that are considered to be\nsimilar to them. Hence, political economy and
  sociology are counted as\nsciences, whereas studies of literature and history are
  usually not.\nThe corresponding German word, “Wissenschaft”, has a much\nbroader
  meaning and includes all the academic specialties, including\nthe humanities. The
  German term has the advantage of more adequately\ndelimiting of the type of systematic
  knowledge that is at stake in the\nconflict between science and pseudoscience. The
  misrepresentations of\nhistory presented by Holocaust deniers and other pseudo-historians
  are\nvery similar in nature to the misrepresentations of natural science\npromoted
  by creationists and homeopaths.\n\nMore importantly, the natural and social sciences
  and the humanities\nare all parts of the same human endeavour, namely systematic
  and\ncritical investigations aimed at acquiring the best possible\nunderstanding
  of the workings of nature, people, and human\nsociety. The disciplines that form
  this community of knowledge\ndisciplines are increasingly interdependent (Hansson
  2007). Since\nthe second half of the 20th century, integrative disciplines such
  as\nastrophysics, evolutionary biology, biochemistry, ecology, quantum\nchemistry,
  the neurosciences, and game theory have developed at\ndramatic speed and contributed
  to tying together previously\nunconnected disciplines. These increased interconnections
  have also\nlinked the sciences and the humanities closer to each other, as can be\nseen
  for instance from how historical knowledge relies increasingly on\nadvanced scientific
  analysis of archaeological findings.\n\nThe conflict between science and pseudoscience
  is best understood\nwith this extended sense of science. On one side of the conflict
  we\nfind the community of knowledge disciplines that includes the natural\nand social
  sciences and the humanities. On the other side we find a\nwide variety of movements
  and doctrines, such as creationism,\nastrology, homeopathy, and Holocaust denialism
  that are in conflict\nwith results and methods that are generally accepted in the
  community\nof knowledge disciplines.\n\nAnother way to express this is that the
  demarcation problem has a\ndeeper concern than that of demarcating the selection
  of human\nactivities that we have for various reasons chosen to call\n“sciences”.
  The ultimate issue is “how to determine\nwhich beliefs are epistemically warranted”
  (Fuller 1985,\n331).\n\nThe phrases “demarcation of science” and\n“demarcation of
  science from pseudoscience” are often used\ninterchangeably, and many authors seem
  to have regarded them as equal\nin meaning. In their view the task of drawing the
  outer boundaries of\nscience is essentially the same as that of drawing the boundary
  between\nscience and pseudoscience.\n\nThis picture is oversimplified. All non-science
  is not\npseudoscience, and science has non-trivial borders to other\nnon-scientific
  phenomena, such as metaphysics, religion, and various\ntypes of non-scientific systematized
  knowledge. (Mahner (2007, 548)\nproposed the term “parascience” to cover non-scientific\npractices
  that are not pseudoscientific.) Science also has the internal\ndemarcation problem
  of distinguishing between good and bad science.\n\nA comparison of the negated terms
  related to science can contribute\nto clarify the conceptual distinctions. “Unscientific”
  is a\nnarrower concept than “non-scientific” (not scientific),\nsince the former
  but not the latter term implies some form of\ncontradiction or conflict with science.
  “Pseudoscientific”\nis in its turn a narrower concept than “unscientific”. The\nlatter
  term differs from the former in covering inadvertent\nmismeasurements and miscalculations
  and other forms of bad science\nperformed by scientists who are recognized as trying
  but failing to\nproduce good science.\n\nEtymology provides us with an obvious starting-point
  for clarifying\nwhat characteristics pseudoscience has in addition to being merely\nnon-
  or un-scientific. “Pseudo-”\n(ψευδο-) means false. In accordance\nwith this, the
  Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines pseudoscience\nas follows:\n\nMany writers
  on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is\nnon-science posing as science.
  The foremost modern classic on the\nsubject (Gardner 1957) bears the title Fads
  and Fallacies in the\nName of Science. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438),\n“[w]hat
  is objectionable about these beliefs is that they\nmasquerade as genuinely scientific
  ones.” These and many other\nauthors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity
  or a teaching\nhas to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996):\n\nThe
  former of these two criteria is central to the concerns of the\nphilosophy of science.
  It has been the subject of important\ncontroversies among philosophers, to be discussed
  below in Section 4.\nThe second criterion is philosophically less important, but
  it needs\ncareful treatment not least since many discussions of pseudoscience (in\nand
  out of philosophy) have been confused due to insufficient attention\nto it.\n\nAn
  immediate problem with the definition based on (1) and (2) is\nthat it is too wide.
  There are phenomena that satisfy both criteria but\nare not commonly called pseudoscientific.
  One of the clearest\nexamples of this is fraud in science. This is a practice that
  has a\nhigh degree of scientific pretence and yet does not comply with\nscience,
  thus satisfying both criteria. Nevertheless, fraud in\notherwise legitimate branches
  of science is seldom if ever called\n“pseudoscience”. The reason for this can be
  clarified with\nthe following hypothetical examples (Hansson 1996).\n\nAccording
  to common usage, 1 and 3 are regarded as cases of bad\nscience, and only 2 as a
  case of pseudoscience. What is present in case\n2, but absent in the other two,
  is a deviant doctrine.\nIsolated breaches of the requirements of science are not
  commonly\nregarded as pseudoscientific. Pseudoscience, as it is commonly\nconceived,
  involves a sustained effort to promote teachings different\nfrom those that have
  scientific legitimacy at the time.\n\nThis explains why fraud in science is not
  usually regarded as\npseudoscientific. Such practices are not in general associated
  with a\ndeviant or unorthodox doctrine. To the contrary, the fraudulent\nscientist
  is anxious that her results be in conformity with the\npredictions of established
  scientific theories. Deviations from these\nwould lead to a much higher risk of
  disclosure.\n\nThe term “science” has both an individuated and an\nunindividuated
  sense. In the individuated sense, biochemistry and\nastronomy are different sciences,
  one of which includes\nstudies of muscle contraction and the other studies of supernovae.
  The\nOxford English Dictionary (OED) defines this sense of science as\n“a particular
  branch of knowledge or study; a recognized\ndepartment of learning”. In the unindividuated
  sense, the study\nof muscle proteins and that of supernovae are parts of “one and\nthe
  same” science. In the words of the OED, unindividuated\nscience is “the kind of
  knowledge or intellectual activity of\nwhich the various ‘sciences‘ are examples”.\n\nPseudoscience
  is an antithesis of science in the individuated rather\nthan the unindividuated
  sense. There is no unified corpus of\npseudoscience corresponding to the corpus
  of science. For a phenomenon\nto be pseudoscientific, it must belong to one or the
  other of the\nparticular pseudosciences. In order to accommodate this feature, the\nabove
  definition can be modified by replacing (2) by the following\n(Hansson 1996):\n\nMost
  philosophers of science, and most scientists, prefer to regard\nscience as constituted
  by methods of inquiry rather than by particular\ndoctrines. There is an obvious
  tension between (2′) and this\nconventional view of science. This, however, may
  be as it should since\npseudoscience often involves a representation of science
  as a closed\nand finished doctrine rather than as a methodology for open-ended\ninquiry.\n\nSometimes
  the term “pseudoscience” is used in a wider\nsense than that which is captured in
  the definition constituted of (1)\nand (2′). Contrary to (2′), doctrines that conflict
  with\nscience are sometimes called “pseudoscientific” in spite of\nnot being advanced
  as scientific. Hence, Grove (1985, 219) included\namong the pseudoscientific doctrines
  those that “purport to offer\nalternative accounts to those of science or claim
  to explain what\nscience cannot explain.” Similarly, Lugg (1987, 227–228)\nmaintained
  that “the clairvoyant's predictions are\npseudoscientific whether or not they are
  correct”, despite the\nfact that most clairvoyants do not profess to be practitioners
  of\nscience. In this sense, pseudoscience is assumed to include not only\ndoctrines
  contrary to science proclaimed to be scientific but\ndoctrines contrary to science tout
  court, whether or not they\nare put forward in the name of science. To cover this
  wider sense of\npseudoscience, (2′) can be modified as follows (Hansson 1996, 2013):\n\nCommon
  usage seems to vacillate between the definitions\n(1)+(2′) and (1)+(2″); and this
  in an interesting\nway: In their comments on the meaning of the term, critics of\npseudoscience
  tend to endorse a definition close to (1)+(2′), but\ntheir actual usage is often
  closer to (1)+(2″).\n\nThe following examples serve to illustrate the difference
  between\nthe two definitions and also to clarify why clause (1) is needed:\n\n(a)
  does not satisfy (1), and is therefore not pseudoscientific on\neither account.
  (b) satisfies (1) but neither (2′) nor\n(2″) and is therefore not pseudoscientific
  on either\naccount. (c) satisfies all three criteria, (1), (2′), and\n(2″), and
  is therefore pseudoscientific on both accounts.\nFinally, (d) satisfies (1) and
  (2″) and is therefore\npseudoscientific according to (1)+(2″) but not according\nto
  (1)+(2′). As the last two examples illustrate, pseudoscience\nand anti-science are
  sometimes difficult to distinguish. Promoters of\nsome pseudosciences (notably homeopathy)
  tend to be ambiguous between\nopposition to science and claims that they themselves
  represent the\nbest science.\n\nVarious proposals have been put forward on exactly
  what elements in\nscience or pseudoscience criteria of demarcation should be applied
  to.\nProposals include that the demarcation should refer to a research\nprogram
  (Lakatos 1974a, 248–249), an epistemic field or cognitive\ndiscipline, i.e. a group
  of people with common knowledge aims, and\ntheir practices (Bunge 1982, 2001; Mahner
  2007), a theory (Popper\n1962, 1974), a practice (Lugg 1992; Morris 1987), a scientific\nproblem
  or question (Siitonen 1984), and a particular inquiry (Kuhn\n1974; Mayo 1996). It
  is probably fair to say that demarcation criteria\ncan be meaningfully applied on
  each of these levels of description. A\nmuch more difficult problem is whether one
  of these levels is the\nfundamental level to which assessments on the other levels
  are\nreducible.\n\nDerksen (1993) differs from most other writers on the subject
  in\nplacing the emphasis in demarcation on the pseudoscientist, i.e. the\nindividual
  person conducting pseudoscience. His major argument for this\nis that pseudoscience
  has scientific pretensions, and such pretensions\nare associated with a person,
  not a theory, practice or entire field.\nHowever, as was noted by Settle (1971),
  it is the rationality and\ncritical attitude built into institutions, rather than
  the personal\nintellectual traits of individuals, that distinguishes science from\nnon-scientific
  practices such as magic. The individual practitioner of\nmagic in a pre-literate
  society is not necessarily less rational than\nthe individual scientist in modern
  Western society. What she lacks is\nan intellectual environment of collective rationality
  and mutual\ncriticism. “It is almost a fallacy of division to insist on each\nindividual
  scientist being critically-minded” (Settle 1971,\n174).\n\nSome authors have maintained
  that the demarcation between science\nand pseudoscience must be timeless. If this
  were true, then it would be\ncontradictory to label something as pseudoscience at
  one but not\nanother point in time. Hence, after showing that creationism is in
  some\nrespects similar to some doctrines from the early 18th\ncentury, one author
  maintained that “if such an activity was\ndescribable as science then, there is
  a cause for describing it as\nscience now” (Dolby 1987, 207). This argument is based
  on a\nfundamental misconception of science. It is an essential feature of\nscience
  that it methodically strives for improvement through empirical\ntesting, intellectual
  criticism, and the exploration of new terrain. A\nstandpoint or theory cannot be
  scientific unless it relates adequately\nto this process of improvement, which means
  as a minimum that\nwell-founded rejections of previous scientific standpoints are\naccepted.
  The demarcation of science cannot be timeless, for the simple\nreason that science
  itself is not timeless.\n\nNevertheless, the mutability of science is one of the
  factors that\nrenders the demarcation between science and pseudoscience difficult.\nDerkson
  (1993, 19) rightly pointed out three major reasons why\ndemarcation is sometimes
  difficult: science changes over time, science\nis heterogenous, and established
  science itself is not free of the\ndefects characteristic of pseudoscience.\n\nAttempts
  to define what we today call science have a long history,\nand the roots of the
  demarcation problem have sometimes been traced\nback to Aristotle's Posterior Analytics
  (Laudan 1983).\nHowever it was not until the 20th century that influential\ndefinitions
  of science have contrasted it against pseudoscience.\n\nAround 1930, the logical
  positivists of the Vienna Circle developed\nvarious verificationist approaches to
  science. The basic idea was that\na scientific statement could be distinguished
  from a metaphysical\nstatement by being at least in principle possible to verify.
  This\nstandpoint was associated with the view that the meaning of a\nproposition
  is its method of verification (see the section on \nVerificationism in the entry
  on  the\n  Vienna Circle).\n This proposal has often been included in accounts of
  the demarcation\nbetween science and pseudoscience. However, this is not historically\nquite
  accurate since the verificationist proposals had the aim of\nsolving a distinctly
  different demarcation problem, namely that between\nscience and metaphysics.\n\nPopper
  described the demarcation problem as the “key to most\nof the fundamental problems
  in the philosophy of science”\n(Popper 1962, 42). He rejected verifiability as a
  criterion for a\nscientific theory or hypothesis to be scientific, rather than\npseudoscientific
  or metaphysical. Instead he proposed as a criterion\nthat the theory be falsifiable,
  or more precisely that\n“statements or systems of statements, in order to be ranked
  as\nscientific, must be capable of conflicting with possible, or\nconceivable observations”
  (Popper 1962, 39).\n\nPopper presented this proposal as a way to draw the line between\nstatements
  belonging to the empirical sciences and “all other\nstatements – whether they are
  of a religious or of a metaphysical\ncharacter, or simply pseudoscientific” (Popper
  1962, 39; cf.\nPopper 1974, 981). It was both an alternative to the logical\npositivists’
  verification criteria and a criterion for\ndistinguishing between science and pseudoscience.
  Although Popper did\nnot emphasize the distinction, these are of course two different\nissues
  (Bartley 1968). Popper conceded that metaphysical statements\nmay be “far from meaningless”
  (1974, 978–979) but showed no\nsuch appreciation of pseudoscientific statements.\n\nPopper's
  demarcation criterion has been criticized both for\nexcluding legitimate science
  (Hansson 2006) and for giving some\npseudosciences the status of being scientific
  (Agassi 1991; Mahner\n2007, 518–519). Strictly speaking, his criterion excludes
  the\npossibility that there can be a pseudoscientific claim that is\nrefutable.
  According to Larry Laudan (1983, 121), it “has the\nuntoward consequence of countenancing
  as ‘scientific’ every\ncrank claim which makes ascertainably false assertions”.\nAstrology,
  rightly taken by Popper as an unusually clear example of a\npseudoscience, has in
  fact been tested and thoroughly refuted (Culver\nand Ianna 1988; Carlson 1985).
  Similarly, the major threats to the\nscientific status of psychoanalysis, another
  of his major targets, do\nnot come from claims that it is untestable but from claims
  that it has\nbeen tested and failed the tests.\n\nDefenders of Popper have claimed
  that this criticism relies on an\nuncharitable interpretation of his ideas. They
  claim that he should not\nbe interpreted as meaning that falsifiability is a sufficient
  condition\nfor demarcating science. Some passages seem to suggest that he takes
  it\nas only a necessary condition (Feleppa 1990, 142). Other passages\nsuggest that
  for a theory to be scientific, Popper requires (in\naddition to falsifiability)
  that energetic attempts are made to put the\ntheory to test and that negative outcomes
  of the tests are accepted\n(Cioffi 1985, 14–16). A falsification-based demarcation
  criterion that\nincludes these elements will avoid the most obvious counter-arguments\nto
  a criterion based on falsifiability alone.\n\nHowever, in what seems to be his last
  statement of his position,\nPopper declared that falsifiability is both a necessary
  and a\nsufficient criterion. “A sentence (or a theory) is\nempirical-scientific
  if and only if it is falsifiable”.\nFurthermore, he emphasized that the falsifiability
  referred to here\n“only has to do with the logical structure of sentences and\nclasses
  of sentences” (Popper [1989] 1994, 82). A (theoretical)\nsentence, he says, is falsifiable
  if and only if it logically\ncontradicts some (empirical) sentence that describes
  a logically\npossible event that it would be logically possible to observe (Popper\n[1989]
  1994, 83). A statement can be falsifiable in this sense although\nit is not in practice
  possible to falsify it. It would seem to follow\nfrom this interpretation that a
  statement's status as scientific\nor non-scientific does not shift with time. On
  previous occasions he\nseems to have interpreted falsifiability differently, and
  maintained\nthat “what was a metaphysical idea yesterday can become a\ntestable
  scientific theory tomorrow; and this happens\nfrequently” (Popper 1974, 981, cf.
  984).\n\nLogical falsifiability is a much weaker criterion than practical\nfalsifiability.
  However, even logical falsifiability can create\nproblems in practical demarcations.
  Popper once adopted the view that\nnatural selection is not a proper scientific
  theory, arguing that it comes\nclose to only saying that “survivors survive”, which
  is\ntautological. “Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory, but\na metaphysical
  research program” (Popper 1976, 168). This\nstatement has been criticized by evolutionary
  scientists who pointed\nout that it misrepresents evolution. The theory of natural
  selection\nhas given rise to many predictions that have withstood tests both in\nfield
  studies and in laboratory settings (Ruse 1977; 2000).\n\nIn a lecture in Darwin
  College in 1977, Popper retracted his\nprevious view that the theory of natural
  selection is tautological. He\nnow admitted that it is a testable theory although
  “difficult to\ntest” (Popper 1978, 344). However, in spite of his well-argued\nrecantation
  his previous standpoint continues to be propagated in\ndefiance of the accumulating
  evidence from empirical tests of natural\nselection.\n\nThomas Kuhn is one of many
  philosophers for whom Popper's view\non the demarcation problem was a starting-point
  for developing their\nown ideas. Kuhn criticized Popper for characterizing “the
  entire\nscientific enterprise in terms that apply only to its occasional\nrevolutionary
  parts” (Kuhn 1974, 802). Popper's focus on\nfalsifications of theories led to a
  concentration on the rather rare\ninstances when a whole theory is at stake. According
  to Kuhn, the way\nin which science works on such occasions cannot be used to characterize\nthe
  entire scientific enterprise. Instead it is in “normal\nscience”, the science that
  takes place between the unusual\nmoments of scientific revolutions, that we find
  the characteristics by\nwhich science can be distinguished from other enterprises
  (Kuhn 1974,\n801).\n\nIn normal science, the scientist's activity consists in\nsolving
  puzzles rather than testing fundamental theories. In\npuzzle-solving, current theory
  is accepted, and the puzzle is indeed defined\nin its terms. In Kuhn's view, “it
  is normal science, in which\nSir Karl's sort of testing does not occur, rather than\nextraordinary
  science which most nearly distinguishes science from\nother enterprises”, and therefore
  a demarcation criterion must\nrefer to the workings of normal science (Kuhn 1974,
  802). Kuhn's\nown demarcation criterion is the capability of puzzle-solving that\nhe
  sees as an essential characteristic of normal science.\n\nKuhn's view of demarcation
  is most clearly expressed in his\ncomparison of astronomy with astrology. Since
  antiquity, astronomy has\nbeen a puzzle-solving activity and therefore a science.
  If an\nastronomer's prediction failed, then this was a puzzle that he\ncould hope
  to solve for instance with more measurements or with\nadjustments of the theory.
  In contrast, the astrologer had no such\npuzzles since in that discipline “particular
  failures did not\ngive rise to research puzzles, for no man, however skilled, could
  make\nuse of them in a constructive attempt to revise the astrological\ntradition”
  (Kuhn 1974, 804). Therefore, according to Kuhn,\nastrology has never been a science.\n\nPopper
  disapproved thoroughly of Kuhn's demarcation criterion.\nAccording to Popper, astrologers
  are engaged in puzzle solving, and\nconsequently Kuhn's criterion commits him to
  recognize astrology\nas a science. (Contrary to Kuhn, Popper defined puzzles as
  “minor\nproblems which do not affect the routine”.) In his view\nKuhn's proposal
  leads to “the major disaster” of a\n“replacement of a rational criterion of science
  by a sociological\none” (Popper 1974, 1146–1147).\n\nPopper's demarcation criterion
  concerns the logical structure\nof theories. Imre Lakatos described this criterion
  as “a rather\nstunning one. A theory may be scientific even if there is not a shred\nof
  evidence in its favour, and it may be pseudoscientific even if all\nthe available
  evidence is in its favour. That is, the scientific or\nnon-scientific character
  of a theory can be determined independently of\nthe facts” (Lakatos 1981, 117).\n\nInstead,
  Lakatos (1970; 1974a; 1974b; 1981) proposed a modification\nof Popper's criterion
  that he called “sophisticated\n(methodological) falsificationism”. On this view,
  the demarcation\ncriterion should not be applied to an isolated hypothesis or theory
  but\nrather to a whole research program that is characterized by a series of\ntheories
  successively replacing each other. In his view, a research\nprogram is progressive
  if the new theories make surprising predictions\nthat are confirmed. In contrast,
  a degenerating research programme is\ncharacterized by theories being fabricated
  only in order to accommodate\nknown facts. Progress in science is only possible
  if a research program\nsatisfies the minimum requirement that each new theory that
  is\ndeveloped in the program has a larger empirical content than its\npredecessor.
  If a research program does not satisfy this requirement,\nthen it is pseudoscientific.\n\nAccording
  to Paul Thagard, a theory or discipline is\npseudoscientific if it satisfies two
  criteria. One of these is that the\ntheory fails to progress, and the other that
  “the community of\npractitioners makes little attempt to develop the theory towards\nsolutions
  of the problems, shows no concern for attempts to evaluate\nthe theory in relation
  to others, and is selective in considering\nconfirmations and disconfirmations”
  (Thagard 1978, 228). A major\ndifference between his approach and that of Lakatos
  is that Lakatos\nwould classify a nonprogressive discipline as pseudoscientific
  even if\nits practitioners work hard to improve it and turn it into a\nprogressive
  discipline.\n\nIn a somewhat similar vein, Daniel Rothbart (1990) emphasized the\ndistinction
  between the standards to be used when testing a\ntheory and those to be used when
  determining whether a theory\nshould at all be tested. The latter, the eligibility
  criteria, include\nthat the theory should encapsulate the explanatory success of
  its\nrival, and that it should yield testable implications that are inconsistent\nwith
  those of the rival. According to Rothbart, a theory is\nunscientific if it is not
  testworthy in this sense.\n\nGeorge Reisch proposed that demarcation could be based
  on the\nrequirement that a scientific discipline be adequately integrated into\nthe
  other sciences. The various scientific disciplines have strong\ninterconnections
  that are based on methodology, theory, similarity of\nmodels etc. Creationism, for
  instance, is not scientific because its\nbasic principles and beliefs are incompatible
  with those that connect\nand unify the sciences. More generally speaking, says Reisch,
  an\nepistemic field is pseudoscientific if it cannot be incorporated into\nthe existing
  network of established sciences (Reisch 1998; cf. Bunge\n1982, 379).\n\nA different
  approach, namely to base demarcation criteria on the\nvalue base of science, was
  proposed by sociologist Robert K. Merton\n([1942] 1973). According to Merton, science
  is characterized by an\n“ethos”, i.e. spirit, that can be summarized as four sets\nof
  institutional imperatives. The first of these,\nuniversalism, asserts that whatever
  their origins, truth\nclaims should be subjected to preestablished, impersonal criteria.
  This\nimplies that the acceptance or rejection of claims should not depend on\nthe
  personal or social qualities of their protagonists.\n\nThe second imperative, communism,
  says that the substantive\nfindings of science are the products of social collaboration
  and\ntherefore belong to the community, rather than being owned by\nindividuals
  or groups. This is, as Merton pointed out, incompatible\nwith patents that reserve
  exclusive rights of use to inventors and\ndiscoverers. The term “communism” is somewhat
  infelicitous;\n“communality” probably captures better what Merton aimed\nat.\n\nHis
  third imperative, disinterestedness, imposes a pattern\nof institutional control
  that is intended to curb the effects of\npersonal or ideological motives that individual
  scientists may have.\nThe fourth imperative, organized scepticism, implies that\nscience
  allows detached scrutiny of beliefs that are dearly held by\nother institutions.
  This is what sometimes brings science into\nconflicts with religions and other ideologies.\n\nMerton
  described these criteria as belonging to the sociology of\nscience, and thus as
  empirical statements about norms in actual science\nrather than normative statements
  about how science should be\nconducted (Merton [1942] 1973, 268). His criteria have
  often been\ndismissed by sociologists as oversimplified, and they have only had\nlimited
  influence in philosophical discussions on the demarcation\nissue (Dolby 1987; Ruse
  2000). Their potential in the latter context\ndoes not seem to have been sufficiently
  explored.\n\nPopper's method of demarcation consists essentially of the\nsingle
  criterion of falsifiability (although some authors have wanted\nto combine it with
  the additional criteria that tests are actually\nperformed and their outcomes respected,
  see Section 4.2). Most of the\nother criteria discussed above are similarly mono-criterial,
  of course\nwith Merton's proposal as a major exception.\n\nMost authors who have
  proposed demarcation criteria have instead put\nforward a list of such criteria.
  A large number of lists have been\npublished that consist of (usually 5–10) criteria
  that can be\nused in combination to identify a pseudoscience or pseudoscientific\npractice.
  This includes lists by Langmuir ([1953] 1989),\nGruenberger (1964), Dutch (1982),
  Bunge (1982), Radner and Radner\n(1982), Kitcher (1982, 30–54), Hansson (1983),
  Grove (1985), Thagard\n(1988), Glymour and Stalker (1990), Derkson (1993, 2001),
  Vollmer\n(1993), Ruse (1996, 300–306) and Mahner (2007). Many of the criteria\nthat
  appear on such lists relate closely to criteria discussed above in\nSections 4.2
  and 4.4. One such list reads as follows:\n\nSome of the authors who have proposed
  multicriterial demarcations\nhave defended this approach as being superior to any
  mono-criterial\ndemarcation. Hence, Bunge (1982, 372) asserted that many philosophers\nhave
  failed to provide an adequate definition of science since they\nhave presupposed
  that a single attribute will do; in his view the\ncombination several criteria is
  needed. Dupré (1993, 242)\nproposed that science is best understood as a Wittgensteinian
  family\nresemblance concept. This would mean that there is a set of features\nthat
  are characteristic of science, but although every part of science\nwill have some
  of these features, we should not expect any part of\nscience to have all of them.\n\nHowever,
  a multicriterial definition of science is not needed to\njustify a multicriterial
  account of how pseudoscience deviates from\nscience. Even if science can be characterized
  by a single defining\ncharacteristic, different pseudoscientific practices may deviate
  from\nscience in widely divergent ways. Hence, the above-mentioned\nseven-itemed
  characterization of pseudoscience was proposed as\nrepresenting seven common ways
  to deviate from a minimal (necessary\nbut not sufficient) criterion of science,
  namely: Science is a\nsystematic search for knowledge whose validity does not depend
  on the\nparticular individual but is open for anyone to check or\nrediscover.\n\nKuhn
  observed that although his own and Popper's criteria of\ndemarcation are profoundly
  different, they lead to essentially the\nsame conclusions on what should be counted
  as science respectively\npseudoscience (Kuhn 1974, 803). This convergence of theoretically\ndivergent
  demarcation criteria is a quite general phenomenon.\nPhilosophers and other theoreticians
  of science differ widely in their\nviews on what science is. Nevertheless, there
  is virtual unanimity in\nthe community of knowledge disciplines on most particular
  issues of\ndemarcation. There is widespread agreement for instance that\ncreationism,
  astrology, homeopathy, Kirlian photography, dowsing,\nufology, ancient astronaut
  theory, Holocaust denialism, Velikovskian\ncatastrophism, and climate change denialism
  are pseudosciences. There\nare a few points of controversy, for instance concerning
  the status of\nFreudian psychoanalysis, but the general picture is one of consensus\nrather
  than controversy in particular issues of demarcation.\n\nIt is in a sense paradoxical
  that so much agreement has been reached\nin particular issues in spite of almost
  complete disagreement on the\ngeneral criteria that these judgments should presumably
  be based upon.\nThis puzzle is a sure indication that there is still much important\nphilosophical
  work to be done on the demarcation between science and\npseudoscience.\n\nPhilosophical
  reflection on pseudoscience has brought forth other\ninteresting problem areas in
  addition to the demarcation between\nscience and pseudoscience. Examples include
  related demarcations such\nas that between science and religion, the relationship
  between science\nand reliable non-scientific knowledge (for instance everyday\nknowledge),
  the scope for justifiable simplifications in science\neducation and popular science,
  the nature and justification of\nmethodological naturalism in science (Boudry et
  al 2010), and the\nmeaning or meaninglessness of the concept of a supernatural\nphenomenon.
  Several of these problem areas have as yet not received\nmuch philosophical attention.\n\n
