rawText: "\r\n\r\nComputer 50\r\nThe University of Manchester Celebrates\r\n    the
  Birth of the Modern Computer\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate of 26 July 2010: Dr Brian Napper,
  the author of these pages, sadly passed away in March 2009. The\r\nComputer50 pages
  are now maintained by Toby Howard  at the\r\nSchool of Computer Science, The University
  of Manchester. For any\r\nqueries about these pages, please email\r\nToby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  Small-Scale Experimental Machine, known as SSEM, or\r\nthe \"Baby\", was designed
  and built at\r\nThe University of Manchester,\r\nand made its first successful run
  of a program on June 21st 1948.\r\nIt was the first machine that had all the components
  now classically regarded\r\nas characteristic of the basic computer. Most importantly
  it was the first\r\ncomputer that could store not only data but any (short!) user
  program\r\nin electronic memory and process it at electronic speed.\r\nFrom this
  Small-Scale Experimental Machine a full-sized \r\nmachine was designed and built,
  the\r\nManchester Mark 1, which by April 1949 was\r\ngenerally available for computation
  in scientific research in the University.\r\nWith the integration of a high speed
  magnetic drum by the Autumn (the ancestor\r\nof today's disc) this was the first
  machine with a fast electronic and magnetic\r\ntwo-level store. It in turn was the
  basis of the first commercially available\r\ncomputer, the\r\nFerranti Mark 1, the
  first machine off the production\r\nline being delivered in February 1951.\r\n\r\nThese
  pages tell the story of the Baby and the Mark 1,\r\nand give a record of the 50th
  anniversary\r\ncelebrations for the Mark 1, and the machines that followed it.\r\n\r\nThe
  highlight of the 1998 Celebrations was the construction of a\r\nworking replica
  of the Baby now on display at the\r\nMuseum of Science\r\nand Industry in Manchester\r\n(see
  Galleries > 1830\r\nWarehouse > Baby Computer).\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can see the latest
