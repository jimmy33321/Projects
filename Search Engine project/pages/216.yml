  support and encourage  each team member—from compensation to education to supporting
  \ a strong work/life balance.\n                \n                        We care

  leave. If you enjoy being active, we offer reimbursement for gym membership and
  other fitness activities. If you work in one of our high-tech offices, you’ll be
  treated to a healthy, gourmet lunch every day.\n                    \n                        We
  believe every employee should share in our success, so we offer competitive salaries,
  stock options, and retirement plans with a company match.\n                    \n
  \                       We actively encourage continued education. From teams sharing
  knowledge internally to external training and formal tuition reimbursement, we value
  a team that’s striving to always be better.\n                    \n                        We

  desks are standard issue.\n                    \n                        We believe
  teams perform their best when people enjoy their jobs and the people they work with.
  We offer multiple ways for team members to interact with each other after-hours,
  whether you work in the office or remotely.\n                    \n                    We
  have offices in New York, London, and Denver.  For many teams and openings, we also
