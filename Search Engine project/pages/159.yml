  History (from Greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning "inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation")[2] is the study of the past, particularly how it relates to humans.[3][4] It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians. Events occurring prior to written record are considered prehistory.
- |
  History can also refer to the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events, and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them.[5][6] Historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing "perspective" on the problems of the present.[5][7][8][9]
- |
  Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding King Arthur), are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends, because they do not show the "disinterested investigation" required of the discipline of history.[10][11]Herodotus, a 5th-century BCE Greek historian is considered within the Western tradition to be the "father of history", and, along with his contemporary Thucydides, helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history. Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. In Asia, a state chronicle, the Spring and Autumn Annals was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BCE although only 2nd century BCE texts survived.
- |
  Ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in university studies.

  History by Frederick Dielman (1896)

  The word history comes ultimately from Ancient Greek ἱστορία[12] (historía), meaning "inquiry","knowledge from inquiry", or "judge". It was in that sense that Aristotle used the word in his Περὶ Τὰ Ζῷα Ἱστορίαι[13] (Perì Tà Zôa Ηistoríai "Inquiries about Animals"). The ancestor word ἵστωρ is attested early on in Homeric Hymns, Heraclitus, the Athenian ephebes' oath, and in Boiotic inscriptions (in a legal sense, either "judge" or "witness", or similar).
- |
  The Greek word was borrowed into Classical Latin as historia, meaning 'investigation, inquiry, research, account, description, written account of past events, writing of history, historical narrative, recorded knowledge of past events, story, narrative'. History was borrowed from Latin (possibly via Old Irish or Old Welsh) into Old English as stær ('history, narrative, story'), but this word fell out of use in the late Old English period.[14]
- |
  Meanwhile, as Latin became Old French (and Anglo-Norman), historia developed into forms such as istorie, estoire, and historie, with new developments in the meaning: 'account of the events of a person's life (beginning of the 12th cent.), chronicle, account of events as relevant to a group of people or people in general (1155), dramatic or pictorial representation of historical events (c1240), body of knowledge relative to human evolution, science (c1265), narrative of real or imaginary events, story (c1462)'.[14]
- |
  It was from Anglo-Norman that history was borrowed into Middle English, and this time the loan stuck. It appears in the thirteenth-century Ancrene Riwle, but seems to have become a common word in the late fourteenth century, with an early attestation appearing in John Gower's Confessio Amantis of the 1390s (VI.1383): 'I finde in a bok compiled | To this matiere an old histoire, | The which comth nou to mi memoire'. In Middle English, the meaning of history was "story" in general. The restriction to the meaning 'the branch of knowledge that deals with past events; the formal record or study of past events, esp. human affairs' arose in the mid-fifteenth century.[14]
- |
  With the Renaissance, older senses of the word were revived, and it was in the Greek sense that Francis Bacon used the term in the late sixteenth century, when he wrote about "Natural History". For him, historia was "the knowledge of objects determined by space and time", that sort of knowledge provided by memory (while science was provided by reason, and poetry was provided by fantasy).[15]
- |
  In an expression of the linguistic synthetic vs. analytic/isolating dichotomy, English like Chinese (史 vs. 诌) now designates separate words for human history and storytelling in general. In modern German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both "history" and "story".
- |
  The adjective historical is attested from 1661, and historic from 1669.[16]
- |
  Historian in the sense of a "researcher of history" is attested from 1531. In all European languages, the substantive "history" is still used to mean both "what happened with men", and "the scholarly study of the happened", the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, "History", or the word historiography.[13]

  Historians write in the context of their own time, and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society. In the words of Benedetto Croce, "All history is contemporary history". History is facilitated by the formation of a 'true discourse of past' through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race.[17] The modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.
- |
  All events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record.[18] The task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past. Therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the 'true past').
- |
  The study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the humanities and at other times as part of the social sciences.[19] It can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from both. Some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification.[20] In the 20th century, French historian Fernand Braudel revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as economics, anthropology, and geography in the study of global history.
- |
  Traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an oral tradition, and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts. From the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures. In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three.[21] But writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.
- |
  Archaeology is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects, which, once unearthed, contribute to the study of history. But archaeology rarely stands alone. It uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries. However, archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history; that is to say, archaeology does not "fill the gaps" within textual sources. Indeed, "historical archaeology" is a specific branch of archaeology, often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources. For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical Annapolis, Maryland, USA; has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment, despite the ideology of "liberty" inherent in written documents at this time.
- |
  There are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, culturally, territorially, and thematically. These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant overlaps are often present, as in "The International Women's Movement in an Age of Transition, 1830–1975." It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization. The area called Big History resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. History has often been studied with some practical or theoretical aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.[22]

  The history of the world is the memory of the past experience of Homo sapiens sapiens around the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely in written records. By "prehistory", historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. By studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record. Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of Sub-Saharan Africa and pre-Columbian America. Historians in the West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the Western world.[23] In 1961, British historian E. H. Carr wrote:
- |2+

- |
  The line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease to live only in the present, and become consciously interested both in their past and in their future. History begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future. Records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.[24]

  This definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as Australian Aboriginals and New Zealand Māori in the past, and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with European civilization.

  Historiography has a number of related meanings. Firstly, it can refer to how history has been produced: the story of the development of methodology and practices (for example, the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis). Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical writing (for example, "medieval historiography during the 1960s" means "Works of medieval history written during the 1960s"). Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the Philosophy of history. As a meta-level analysis of descriptions of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives, interpretations, worldview, use of evidence, or method of presentation of other historians. Professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives.[25][26]

  Philosophy of history
- |2+

- |
  History's philosophical questions
- |
  What is the proper unit for the study of the human past—the individual? The polis? The civilization? The culture? Or the nation state?
- |
  Are there broad patterns and progress? Are there cycles? Is human history random and devoid of any meaning?
- |2+

- |
  Main article: Philosophy of history
- |
  Philosophy of history is a branch of philosophy concerning the eventual significance, if any, of human history. Furthermore, it speculates as to a possible teleological end to its development—that is, it asks if there is a design, purpose, directive principle, or finality in the processes of human history. Philosophy of history should not be confused with historiography, which is the study of history as an academic discipline, and thus concerns its methods and practices, and its development as a discipline over time. Nor should philosophy of history be confused with the history of philosophy, which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas through time.

  Historical method basics
- |
  The following questions are used by historians in modern work.
- |
  When was the source, written or unwritten, produced (date)?
- |
  Where was it produced (localization)?
- |
  By whom was it produced (authorship)?
- |
  From what pre-existing material was it produced (analysis)?
- |
  In what original form was it produced (integrity)?
- |
  What is the evidential value of its contents (credibility)?
- |
  The first four are known as higher criticism; the fifth, lower criticism; and, together, external criticism. The sixth and final inquiry about a source is called internal criticism.

- |
  The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write history.

  Herodotus of Halicarnassus (484 BC – ca.425 BC)[27] has generally been acclaimed as the "father of history". However, his contemporary Thucydides (ca. 460 BC – ca. 400 BC) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the History of the Peloponnesian War. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention.[27] In his historical method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, a neutral point of view, and that the human world was the result of the actions of human beings. Greek historians also viewed history as cyclical, with events regularly recurring.[28]
- |
  There were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval China. The groundwork for professional historiography in East Asia was established by the Han Dynasty court historian known as Sima Qian (145–90 BC), author of the Shiji (Records of the Grand Historian). For the quality of his written work, Sima Qian is posthumously known as the Father of Chinese Historiography. Chinese historians of subsequent dynastic periods in China used his Shiji as the official format for historical texts, as well as for biographical literature.[citation needed]
- |
  Saint Augustine was influential in Christian and Western thought at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and Renaissance periods, history was often studied through a sacred or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel brought philosophy and a more secular approach in historical study.[22]
- |
  In the preface to his book, the Muqaddimah (1377), the Arab historian and early sociologist, Ibn Khaldun, warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past. Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle superstition and uncritical acceptance of historical data." As a result, he introduced a scientific method to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his "new science".[29] His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state, communication, propaganda and systematic bias in history,[30] and he is thus considered to be the "father of historiography"[31][32] or the "father of the philosophy of history".[33]
- |
  In the West, historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany. The 19th-century historian with greatest influence on methods was Leopold von Ranke in Germany.

  In the 20th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or great men, to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a social science rather than as an art, which traditionally had been the case. Some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included Fernand Braudel, E. H. Carr, Fritz Fischer, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Hans-Ulrich Wehler, Bruce Trigger, Marc Bloch, Karl Dietrich Bracher, Peter Gay, Robert Fogel, Lucien Febvre and Lawrence Stone. Many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach. Braudel combined history with geography, Bracher history with political science, Fogel history with economics, Gay history with psychology, Trigger history with archaeology while Wehler, Bloch, Fischer, Stone, Febvre and Le Roy Ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics. More recently, the field of digital history has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.

  In opposition to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as Hugh Trevor-Roper, John Lukacs, Donald Creighton, Gertrude Himmelfarb and Gerhard Ritter argued that the key to the historians' work was the power of the imagination, and hence contended that history should be understood as an art. French historians associated with the Annales School introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of cultural history (cf. histoire des mentalités). Intellectual historians such as Herbert Butterfield, Ernst Nolte and George Mosse have argued for the significance of ideas in history. American historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked ethnic, racial, and socio-economic groups. Another genre of social history to emerge in the post-WWII era was Alltagsgeschichte (History of Everyday Life). Scholars such as Martin Broszat, Ian Kershaw and Detlev Peukert sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century Germany, especially in the Nazi period.

  Marxist historians such as Eric Hobsbawm, E. P. Thompson, Rodney Hilton, Georges Lefebvre, Eugene D. Genovese, Isaac Deutscher, C. L. R. James, Timothy Mason, Herbert Aptheker, Arno J. Mayer and Christopher Hill have sought to validate Karl Marx's theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to the Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as François Furet, Richard Pipes, J. C. D. Clark, Roland Mousnier, Henry Ashby Turner and Robert Conquest have offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history. Feminist historians such as Joan Wallach Scott, Claudia Koonz, Natalie Zemon Davis, Sheila Rowbotham, Gisela Bock, Gerda Lerner, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, and Lynn Hunt have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past. In recent years, postmodernists have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. In his 1997 book In Defence of History, Richard J. Evans, a professor of modern history at Cambridge University, defended the worth of history. Another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the Australian historian Keith Windschuttle's 1994 book, The Killing of History.

  Marxian theory of history
- |
  Main article: Marx's theory of history
- |
  The Marxist theory of historical materialism theorises that society is fundamentally determined by the material conditions at any given time – in other words, the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfil basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families.[34] Overall, Marx and Engels claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in Western Europe.[35] Marxist historiography was once orthodoxy in the Soviet Union, but since the collapse of communism there in 1991, Mikhail Krom says it has been reduced to the margins of scholarship.[36]
- |
  Stages of history
- |
  Marx observed that each stage or epoch created a new class or invention that would lead to its downfall. However the downfall would not be an automatically negative event, since with each step humanity at large would benefit. Each passing stage would therefore raise the standard of living of the masses while at the same time be doomed to its own downfall because of internal contradictions and class conflicts.
- |
  The first three stages are not given particular attention, since by Marx's time they had long come to pass. As such, he does not provide the principles of these stages as he does for capitalism and the stages that follow. Nonetheless, these epochs have common characteristics.

  Periods
- |
  Main article: Periodization
- |
  Historical study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of time. Historians give these periods of time names in order to allow "organising ideas and classificatory generalisations" to be used by historians.[37] The names given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the start and end of a particular period. Centuries and decades are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the dating system used. Most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past. The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied.[38]
- |
  Prehistoric periodisation
- |
  The field of history generally leaves prehistory to the archaeologists, who have entirely different sets of tools and theories. The usual method for periodisation of the distant prehistoric past, in archeology is to rely on changes in material culture and technology, such as the Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age and their sub-divisions also based on different styles of material remains. Despite the development over recent decades of the ability through radiocarbon dating and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts, these long-established schemes seem likely to remain in use. In many cases neighbouring cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it, which may be used.
- |
  Stages of history
- |
  Main article: Marx's theory of history § The stages of history
- |
  The Marxian theory of history identifies five stages of history:[39][40][41][42][43]
- |
  Primitive communism
- |
  The First Stage: is usually called primitive communism. It has the following characteristics.
- |
  Shared property: there is no concept of ownership beyond individual possessions. All is shared by the tribe to ensure its survival.[citation needed]
- |
  Hunting and gathering: tribal societies have yet to develop large scale agriculture and so their survival is a daily struggle.[citation needed]
- |
  Proto-democracy: there is usually no concept of "leadership" yet. So tribes are led by the best warrior if there is war, the best diplomat if they have steady contact with other tribes and so forth.
- |
  Slave society
- |
  The Second Stage: may be called slave society, considered to be the beginning of "class society" where private property appears.
- |
  Class: here the idea of class appears. There is always a slave-owning ruling class and the slaves themselves.
- |
  Statism: the state develops during this stage as a tool for the slave-owners to use and control the slaves.
- |
  Agriculture: people learn to cultivate plants and animals on a large enough scale to support large populations.
- |
  Democracy and authoritarianism: these opposites develop at the same stage. Democracy arises first with the development of the republican city-state, followed by the totalitarian empire.
- |
  Private property: citizens now own more than personal property. Land ownership is especially important during a time of agricultural development.
- |
  Feudalism
- |
  The Third Stage: may be called feudalism; it appears after slave society collapses. This was most obvious during the European Middle Ages when society went from slavery to feudalism.
- |
  Aristocracy: the state is ruled by monarchs who inherit their positions, or at times marry or conquer their ways into leadership.
- |
  Theocracy: this is a time of largely religious rule. When there is only one religion in the land and its organizations affect all parts of daily life.
- |
  Hereditary classes: castes can sometimes form and one's class is determined at birth with no form of advancement. This was the case with India.
- |
  Nation-state: nations are formed from the remnants of the fallen empires. Sometimes to rebuild themselves into empires once more. Such as England's transition from a province to an empire.
- |
  Capitalism
- |
  Marx pays special attention to this stage in human development. The bulk of his work is devoted to analysing the mechanisms of capitalism, which in western society classically arose "red in tooth and claw" from feudal society in a revolutionary movement. In capitalism, the profit motive rules and people, freed from serfdom, work for the capitalists for wages. The capitalist class are free to spread their laissez faire practices around the world. In the capitalist-controlled parliament, laws are made to protect wealth.
- |
  Capitalism may be considered the Fourth Stage in the sequence. It appears after the bourgeois revolution when the capitalists (or their merchant predecessors) overthrow the feudal system. Capitalism is categorized by the following:
- |
  Market economy: In capitalism, the entire economy is guided by market forces. Supporters of laissez faire economics argue that there should be little or no intervention from the government under capitalism. Marxists, however, such as Lenin in his Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, argue that the capitalist government is a powerful instrument for the furtherance of capitalism and the capitalist nation-state, particularly in the conquest of markets abroad.
- |
  Private property: The means of production are no longer in the hands of the monarchy and its nobles, but rather they are controlled by the capitalists. The capitalists control the means of production through commercial enterprises (such as corporations) which aim to maximise profit.
- |
  Parliamentary democracy: The capitalists tend to govern through an elected centralised parliament or congress, rather than under an autocracy. Capitalist (bourgeois) democracy, although it may be extended to the whole population, does not necessarily lead to universal suffrage. Historically it has excluded (by force, segregation, legislation or other means) sections of the population such as women, slaves, ex-slaves, people of colour or those on low income. The government acts on behalf of, and is controlled by, the capitalists through various methods.
- |
  Wages: In capitalism, workers are rewarded according to their contract with their employer. Power elites propagate the illusion that market forces mean wages converge to an equilibrium at which workers are paid for precisely the value of their services. In reality workers are paid less than the value of their productivity — the difference forming profit for the employer. In this sense all paid employment is exploitation and the worker is "alienated" from their work. Insofar as the profit-motive drives the market, it is impossible for workers to be paid for the full value of their labour, as all employers will act in the same manner.
- |
  Imperialism: Wealthy countries seek to dominate poorer countries in order to gain access to raw materials and to provide captive markets for finished products. This is done directly through war, the threat of war, or the export of capital. The capitalist's control over the state can play an essential part in the development of capitalism, to the extent the state directs warfare and other foreign intervention.
- |
  Financial institutions: Banks and capital markets such as stock exchanges direct unused capital to where it is needed. They reduce barriers to entry in all markets, especially to the poor; it is in this way that banks dramatically improve class mobility.
- |
  Monopolistic tendencies: The natural, unrestrained market forces will create monopolies from the most successful commercial entities.
- |
  But according to Marx, capitalism, like slave society and feudalism, also has critical failings — inner contradictions which will lead to its downfall. The working class, to which the capitalist class gave birth in order to produce commodities and profits, is the "grave digger" of capitalism. The worker is not paid the full value of what he or she produces. The rest is surplus value — the capitalist's profit, which Marx calls the "unpaid labour of the working class." The capitalists are forced by competition to attempt to drive down the wages of the working class to increase their profits, and this creates conflict between the classes, and gives rise to the development of class consciousness in the working class. The working class, through trade union and other struggles, becomes conscious of itself as an exploited class. In the view of classical Marxism, the struggles of the working class against the attacks of the capitalist class will eventually lead the working class to establish its own collective control over production
- |
  Socialism
- |
  After the working class gains class consciousness and mounts a revolution against the capitalists, socialism, which may be considered the Fifth Stage, will be attained, if the workers are successful.
- |
  Socialism may be characterised as follows:
- |
  Common property: the means of production are taken from the hands of a few capitalists and put in the hands of the workers. This translates into the democratic communes controlling the means of production.
- |
  Council democracy: Marx, basing himself on a thorough study of Paris Commune, believed that the workers would govern themselves through system of communes. He called this the dictatorship of the proletariat, which, overthrowing the dictatorship (governance) of capital, would democratically plan production and the resources of the planet.
- |
  Marx explained that, since socialism, the first stage of communism, would be "in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges", each worker would naturally expect to be awarded according to the amount of labor he contributes, despite the fact that each worker's ability and family circumstances would differ, so that the results would still be unequal at this stage, although fully supported by social provision.
- |
  Geographical locations
- |
  Particular geographical locations can form the basis of historical study, for example, continents, countries and cities. Understanding why historic events took place is important. To do this, historians often turn to geography. Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there. For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the geography of Egypt is essential. Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks. The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities. That meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization.

  Military history
- |
  Main article: Military history
- |
  Military history concerns warfare, strategies, battles, weapons, and the psychology of combat. The "new military history" since the 1970s has been concerned with soldiers more than generals, with psychology more than tactics, and with the broader impact of warfare on society and culture.[44]
- |
  History of religion
- |
  Main article: Religious history
- |
  The history of religion has been a main theme for both secular and religious historians for centuries, and continues to be taught in seminaries and academe. Leading journals include Church History, Catholic Historical Review, and History of Religions. Topics range widely from political and cultural and artistic dimensions, to theology and liturgy.[45] This subject studies religions from all regions and areas of the world where humans have lived.[46]
- |
  Social history
- |
  Main article: Social history
- |
  Social history, sometimes called the new social history, is the field that includes history of ordinary people and their strategies and institutions for coping with life.[47] In its "golden age" it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments. In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.[48] In the history departments of British universities in 2007, of the 5723 faculty members, 1644 (29%) identified themselves with social history while political history came next with 1425 (25%).[49] The "old" social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were "social" in the sense of being outside the elite system. Social history was contrasted with political history, intellectual history and the history of great men. English historian G. M. Trevelyan saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, "Without social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible."[50] While the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as "history with the people put back in."[51]

  Cultural history replaced social history as the dominant form in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people. How peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic. Cultural history includes the study of art in society as well is the study of images and human visual production (iconography).[52]
- |
  Diplomatic history
- |
  Main article: Diplomatic history
- |
  Diplomatic history focuses on the relationships between nations, primarily regarding diplomacy and the causes of wars. More recently it looks at the causes of peace and human rights. It typically presents the viewpoints of the foreign office, and long-term strategic values, as the driving force of continuity and change in history. This type of political history is the study of the conduct of international relations between states or across state boundaries over time. Historian Muriel Chamberlain notes that after the First World War:
- |
  diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation, at once the most important, most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies.[53]
- |
  She adds that after 1945, the trend reversed, allowing social history to replace it.
- |
  Economic history
- |
  Main articles: Economic history and Business history
- |
  Although economic history has been well established since the late 19th century, in recent years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and away from traditional history departments.[54]Business history deals with the history of individual business organizations, business methods, government regulation, labor relations, and impact on society. It also includes biographies of individual companies, executives, and entrepreneurs. It is related to economic history; Business history is most often taught in business schools.[55]
- |
  Environmental history
- |
  Main article: Environmental history
- |
  Environmental history is a new field that emerged in the 1980s to look at the history of the environment, especially in the long run, and the impact of human activities upon it.[56]

- |
  See also: History of the world and Universal history
- |
  World history is the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. World history is primarily a teaching field, rather than a research field. It gained popularity in the United States,[57] Japan[58] and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds.
- |
  It has led to highly controversial interpretations by Oswald Spengler and Arnold J. Toynbee, among others.
- |
  The World History Association publishes the Journal of World History every quarter since 1990.[59] The H-World discussion list[60] serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews.
- |
  People's history
- |
  Main article: People's history
- |
  A people's history is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events from the perspective of common people. A people's history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders. Individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary focus, which includes the disenfranchised, the oppressed, the poor, the nonconformists, and the otherwise forgotten people. This history also usually focuses on events occurring in the fullness of time, or when an overwhelming wave of smaller events cause certain developments to occur.

  Intellectual history
- |
  Main articles: Intellectual history and History of ideas
- |
  Intellectual history and the history of ideas emerged in the mid-20th century, with the focus on the intellectuals and their books on the one hand, and on the other the study of ideas as disembodied objects with a career of their own.[61][62]
- |
  Gender history
- |
  Main article: Gender history
- |
  Gender history is a sub-field of History and Gender studies, which looks at the past from the perspective of gender. It is in many ways, an outgrowth of women's history. Despite its relatively short life, Gender History (and its forerunner Women's History) has had a rather significant effect on the general study of history. Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases, each with its own challenges and outcomes. Although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession, other influences are more subtle.
- |
  Public history
- |
  Main article: Public history
- |
  Public history describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields. The term itself began to be used in the U.S. and Canada in the late 1970s, and the field has become increasingly professionalized since that time. Some of the most common settings for public history are museums, historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television companies, and all levels of government.[63]

  Professional and amateur historians discover, collect, organize, and present information about past events. In lists of historians, historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which they were writing, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialized. Chroniclers and annalists, though they are not historians in the true sense, are also frequently included.
- |
  The judgement of history
- |
  Since the 20th century, Western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide the "judgement of history."[64] The goals of historical judgements or interpretations are separate to those of legal judgements, that need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final.[65] A related issue to that of the judgement of history is that of collective memory.

  Pseudohistory is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart from standard historiographical conventions in a way which undermines their conclusions. Closely related to deceptive historical revisionism, works which draw controversial conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, particularly in the fields of national, political, military, and religious affairs, are often rejected as pseudohistory.

  Scholarship vs teaching
- |
  A major intellectual battle took place in Britain in the early twentieth century regarding the place of history teaching in the universities. At Oxford and Cambridge, scholarship was downplayed. Professor Charles Harding Firth, Oxford's Regius Professor of history in 1904 ridiculed the system as best suited to produce superficial journalists. The Oxford tutors, who had more votes than the professors, fought back in defense of their system saying that it successfully produced Britain's outstanding statesmen, administrators, prelates, and diplomats, and that mission was as valuable as training scholars. The tutors dominated the debate until after the Second World War. It forced aspiring young scholars to teach at outlying schools, such as Manchester University, where T.F. Tout was professionalising the History undergraduate programme at by introducing the study of original sources and requiring the writing of a thesis.[66][67]
- |
  In the United States, scholarship was concentrated at the major PhD-producing universities, while the large number of other colleges and universities focused on undergraduate teaching. A tendency in the 21st century was for the latter schools to increasingly demand scholarly productivity of their younger tenure-track faculty. Furthermore, universities have increasingly relied on inexpensive part-time adjuncts to do most of the classroom teaching.[68]
- |
  Nationalism
- |
  From the origins of national school systems in the 19th century, the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority. In the United States after World War I, a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in Western Civilization, so as to give students a common heritage with Europe. In the U.S. after 1980 attention increasingly moved toward teaching world history or requiring students to take courses in non-western cultures, to prepare students for life in a globalized economy.[69]
- |
  At the university level, historians debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the humanities. Many view the field from both perspectives.
- |
  The teaching of history in French schools was influenced by the Nouvelle histoire as disseminated after the 1960s by Cahiers pédagogiques and Enseignement and other journals for teachers. Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique, (INRDP). Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils children should learn about historians' approaches as well as facts and dates. Louis François, Dean of the History/Geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote "active methods" which would give pupils "the immense happiness of discovery." Proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored. Traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and national identity.[70]

  In most countries history textbook are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism, and give students the official line about national enemies.[71]
- |
  In many countries history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favorable light. For example, in Japan, mention of the Nanking Massacre has been removed from textbooks and the entire Second World War is given cursory treatment. Other countries have complained.[72] It was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid Marxist historiography.[73][74]
- |
  Academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes with success.[75][76]
- |
  In 21st-century Germany, the history curriculum is controlled by the 16 states, and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an "almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone" and reflects "principles formulated by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, thus oriented towards human rights, democracy and peace." The result is that "German textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centred on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness."[77]

  ^ Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself" (Marx, Karl: Letter to editor of the Russian paper Otetchestvennye Zapiskym, 1877). His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.

  Greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning "inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation")[2]
  is the study of the past, particularly how it relates to humans.[3][4] It is an
  umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection,
  organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events.
  Scholars who write about history are called historians. Events occurring prior to
  written record are considered prehistory.History can also refer to the academic
  discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events,
  and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them.[5][6]
  Historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing
  the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing "perspective"
  on the problems of the present.[5][7][8][9]Stories common to a particular culture,
  but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding King Arthur),
  are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends, because they do not show
  the "disinterested investigation" required of the discipline of history.[10][11]Herodotus,
  a 5th-century BCE Greek historian is considered within the Western tradition to
  be the "father of history", and, along with his contemporary Thucydides, helped
  form the foundations for the modern study of human history. Their works continue
  to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused
  Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing.
  In Asia, a state chronicle, the Spring and Autumn Annals was known to be compiled
  from as early as 722 BCE although only 2nd century BCE texts survived.Ancient influences
  have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved
  over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is
  wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain
  topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught
  as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is
  a major discipline in university studies.The word history comes ultimately from
  Ancient Greek ἱστορία[12] (historía), meaning "inquiry","knowledge from inquiry",
  or "judge". It was in that sense that Aristotle used the word in his Περὶ Τὰ Ζῷα
  Ἱστορίαι[13] (Perì Tà Zôa Ηistoríai "Inquiries about Animals"). The ancestor word
  ἵστωρ is attested early on in Homeric Hymns, Heraclitus, the Athenian ephebes''
  oath, and in Boiotic inscriptions (in a legal sense, either "judge" or "witness",
  or similar).The Greek word was borrowed into Classical Latin as historia, meaning
  ''investigation, inquiry, research, account, description, written account of past
  events, writing of history, historical narrative, recorded knowledge of past events,
  story, narrative''. History was borrowed from Latin (possibly via Old Irish or Old
  Welsh) into Old English as stær (''history, narrative, story''), but this word fell
  out of use in the late Old English period.[14]Meanwhile, as Latin became Old French
  (and Anglo-Norman), historia developed into forms such as istorie, estoire, and
  historie, with new developments in the meaning: ''account of the events of a person''s
  life (beginning of the 12th cent.), chronicle, account of events as relevant to
  a group of people or people in general (1155), dramatic or pictorial representation
  of historical events (c1240), body of knowledge relative to human evolution, science
  (c1265), narrative of real or imaginary events, story (c1462)''.[14]It was from
  Anglo-Norman that history was borrowed into Middle English, and this time the loan
  stuck. It appears in the thirteenth-century Ancrene Riwle, but seems to have become
  a common word in the late fourteenth century, with an early attestation appearing
  in John Gower''s Confessio Amantis of the 1390s (VI.1383): ''I finde in a bok compiled
  | To this matiere an old histoire, | The which comth nou to mi memoire''. In Middle
  English, the meaning of history was "story" in general. The restriction to the meaning
  ''the branch of knowledge that deals with past events; the formal record or study
  of past events, esp. human affairs'' arose in the mid-fifteenth century.[14]With
  the Renaissance, older senses of the word were revived, and it was in the Greek
  sense that Francis Bacon used the term in the late sixteenth century, when he wrote
  about "Natural History". For him, historia was "the knowledge of objects determined
  by space and time", that sort of knowledge provided by memory (while science was
  provided by reason, and poetry was provided by fantasy).[15]In an expression of
  the linguistic synthetic vs. analytic/isolating dichotomy, English like Chinese
  (史 vs. 诌) now designates separate words for human history and storytelling in general.
  In modern German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly
  synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both "history"
  and "story".The adjective historical is attested from 1661, and historic from 1669.[16]Historian
  in the sense of a "researcher of history" is attested from 1531. In all European
  languages, the substantive "history" is still used to mean both "what happened with
  men", and "the scholarly study of the happened", the latter sense sometimes distinguished
  with a capital letter, "History", or the word historiography.[13]Historians write
  in the context of their own time, and with due regard to the current dominant ideas
  of how to interpret the past, and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own
  society. In the words of Benedetto Croce, "All history is contemporary history".
  History is facilitated by the formation of a ''true discourse of past'' through
  the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race.[17]
  The modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of
  this discourse.All events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form
  constitute the historical record.[18] The task of historical discourse is to identify
  the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts
  of past. Therefore, the constitution of the historian''s archive is a result of
  circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts
  and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the ''true past'').The study
  of history has sometimes been classified as part of the humanities and at other
  times as part of the social sciences.[19] It can also be seen as a bridge between
  those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from both. Some individual historians
  strongly support one or the other classification.[20] In the 20th century, French
  historian Fernand Braudel revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside
  disciplines as economics, anthropology, and geography in the study of global history.Traditionally,
  historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on
  an oral tradition, and have attempted to answer historical questions through the
  study of written documents and oral accounts. From the beginning, historians have
  also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures. In general, the
  sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is
  written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult
  all three.[21] But writing is the marker that separates history from what comes
  before.Archaeology is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried
  sites and objects, which, once unearthed, contribute to the study of history. But
  archaeology rarely stands alone. It uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries.
  However, archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which
  are independent from history; that is to say, archaeology does not "fill the gaps"
  within textual sources. Indeed, "historical archaeology" is a specific branch of
  archaeology, often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual
  sources. For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical Annapolis,
  Maryland, USA; has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents
  and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities
  of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment, despite the
  ideology of "liberty" inherent in written documents at this time.There are varieties
  of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, culturally,
  territorially, and thematically. These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and
  significant overlaps are often present, as in "The International Women''s Movement
  in an Age of Transition, 1830–1975." It is possible for historians to concern themselves
  with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has
  been toward specialization. The area called Big History resists this specialization,
  and searches for universal patterns or trends. History has often been studied with
  some practical or theoretical aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual
  curiosity.[22]The history of the world is the memory of the past experience of Homo
  sapiens sapiens around the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely
  in written records. By "prehistory", historians mean the recovery of knowledge of
  the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture
  is not understood. By studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts,
  some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record. Since
  the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history''s
  implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of Sub-Saharan Africa
  and pre-Columbian America. Historians in the West have been criticized for focusing
  disproportionately on the Western world.[23] In 1961, British historian E. H. Carr
  wrote:The line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed
  when people cease to live only in the present, and become consciously interested
  both in their past and in their future. History begins with the handing down of
  tradition; and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past
  into the future. Records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future
  generations.[24]This definition includes within the scope of history the strong
  interests of peoples, such as Australian Aboriginals and New Zealand Māori in the
  past, and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations,
  even before their contact with European civilization.Historiography has a number
  of related meanings. Firstly, it can refer to how history has been produced: the
  story of the development of methodology and practices (for example, the move from
  short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis). Secondly,
  it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical writing (for
  example, "medieval historiography during the 1960s" means "Works of medieval history
  written during the 1960s"). Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the
  Philosophy of history. As a meta-level analysis of descriptions of the past, this
  third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses
  on the narratives, interpretations, worldview, use of evidence, or method of presentation
  of other historians. Professional historians also debate the question of whether
  history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives.[25][26]Philosophy
  of history is a branch of philosophy concerning the eventual significance, if any,
  of human history. Furthermore, it speculates as to a possible teleological end to
  its development—that is, it asks if there is a design, purpose, directive principle,
  or finality in the processes of human history. Philosophy of history should not
  be confused with historiography, which is the study of history as an academic discipline,
  and thus concerns its methods and practices, and its development as a discipline
  over time. Nor should philosophy of history be confused with the history of philosophy,
  which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas through time.The following
  questions are used by historians in modern work.The first four are known as higher
  criticism; the fifth, lower criticism; and, together, external criticism. The sixth
  and final inquiry about a source is called internal criticism.The historical method
  comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources
  and other evidence to research and then to write history.Herodotus of Halicarnassus
  (484 BC – ca.425 BC)[27] has generally been acclaimed as the "father of history".
  However, his contemporary Thucydides (ca. 460 BC – ca. 400 BC) is credited with
  having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work
  the History of the Peloponnesian War. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history
  as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause
  and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention.[27] In his historical
  method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, a neutral point of view, and that the
  human world was the result of the actions of human beings. Greek historians also
  viewed history as cyclical, with events regularly recurring.[28]There were historical
  traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval China.
  The groundwork for professional historiography in East Asia was established by the
  Han Dynasty court historian known as Sima Qian (145–90 BC), author of the Shiji
  (Records of the Grand Historian). For the quality of his written work, Sima Qian
  is posthumously known as the Father of Chinese Historiography. Chinese historians
  of subsequent dynastic periods in China used his Shiji as the official format for
  historical texts, as well as for biographical literature.[citation needed]Saint
  Augustine was influential in Christian and Western thought at the beginning of the
  medieval period. Through the Medieval and Renaissance periods, history was often
  studied through a sacred or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher
  and historian Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel brought philosophy and a more secular
  approach in historical study.[22]In the preface to his book, the Muqaddimah (1377),
  the Arab historian and early sociologist, Ibn Khaldun, warned of seven mistakes
  that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached
  the past as strange and in need of interpretation. The originality of Ibn Khaldun
  was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation
  of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which
  it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for
  experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of
  the past. Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle superstition and uncritical acceptance
  of historical data." As a result, he introduced a scientific method to the study
  of history, and he often referred to it as his "new science".[29] His historical
  method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state, communication,
  propaganda and systematic bias in history,[30] and he is thus considered to be the
  "father of historiography"[31][32] or the "father of the philosophy of history".[33]In
  the West, historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and
  18th centuries, especially in France and Germany. The 19th-century historian with
  greatest influence on methods was Leopold von Ranke in Germany.In the 20th century,
  academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended
  to glorify the nation or great men, to more objective and complex analyses of social
  and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century
  was a tendency to treat history more as a social science rather than as an art,
  which traditionally had been the case. Some of the leading advocates of history
  as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included Fernand
  Braudel, E. H. Carr, Fritz Fischer, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Hans-Ulrich Wehler,
  Bruce Trigger, Marc Bloch, Karl Dietrich Bracher, Peter Gay, Robert Fogel, Lucien
  Febvre and Lawrence Stone. Many of the advocates of history as a social science
  were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach. Braudel combined history
  with geography, Bracher history with political science, Fogel history with economics,
  Gay history with psychology, Trigger history with archaeology while Wehler, Bloch,
  Fischer, Stone, Febvre and Le Roy Ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated
  history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics. More recently, the
  field of digital history has begun to address ways of using computer technology
  to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.In opposition
  to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as Hugh Trevor-Roper,
  John Lukacs, Donald Creighton, Gertrude Himmelfarb and Gerhard Ritter argued that
  the key to the historians'' work was the power of the imagination, and hence contended
  that history should be understood as an art. French historians associated with the
  Annales School introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives
  of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of cultural history
  (cf. histoire des mentalités). Intellectual historians such as Herbert Butterfield,
  Ernst Nolte and George Mosse have argued for the significance of ideas in history.
  American historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked
  ethnic, racial, and socio-economic groups. Another genre of social history to emerge
  in the post-WWII era was Alltagsgeschichte (History of Everyday Life). Scholars
  such as Martin Broszat, Ian Kershaw and Detlev Peukert sought to examine what everyday
  life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century Germany, especially in the Nazi
  period.Marxist historians such as Eric Hobsbawm, E. P. Thompson, Rodney Hilton,
  Georges Lefebvre, Eugene D. Genovese, Isaac Deutscher, C. L. R. James, Timothy Mason,
  Herbert Aptheker, Arno J. Mayer and Christopher Hill have sought to validate Karl
  Marx''s theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to
  the Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as François Furet, Richard
  Pipes, J. C. D. Clark, Roland Mousnier, Henry Ashby Turner and Robert Conquest have
  offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history. Feminist historians such as Joan
  Wallach Scott, Claudia Koonz, Natalie Zemon Davis, Sheila Rowbotham, Gisela Bock,
  Gerda Lerner, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, and Lynn Hunt have argued for the importance
  of studying the experience of women in the past. In recent years, postmodernists
  have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that
  all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. In his 1997 book
  In Defence of History, Richard J. Evans, a professor of modern history at Cambridge
  University, defended the worth of history. Another defence of history from post-modernist
  criticism was the Australian historian Keith Windschuttle''s 1994 book, The Killing
  of History.The Marxist theory of historical materialism theorises that society is
  fundamentally determined by the material conditions at any given time – in other
  words, the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfil basic
  needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families.[34] Overall,
  Marx and Engels claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development
  of these material conditions in Western Europe.[35] Marxist historiography was once
  orthodoxy in the Soviet Union, but since the collapse of communism there in 1991,
  Mikhail Krom says it has been reduced to the margins of scholarship.[36]Marx observed
  that each stage or epoch created a new class or invention that would lead to its
  downfall. However the downfall would not be an automatically negative event, since
  with each step humanity at large would benefit. Each passing stage would therefore
  raise the standard of living of the masses while at the same time be doomed to its
  own downfall because of internal contradictions and class conflicts.The first three
  stages are not given particular attention, since by Marx''s time they had long come
  to pass. As such, he does not provide the principles of these stages as he does
  for capitalism and the stages that follow. Nonetheless, these epochs have common
  characteristics.These are approaches to history; not listed are histories of other
  fields, such as history of science, history of mathematics and history of philosophy.Historical
  study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of
  time. Historians give these periods of time names in order to allow "organising
  ideas and classificatory generalisations" to be used by historians.[37] The names
  given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the start
  and end of a particular period. Centuries and decades are commonly used periods
  and the time they represent depends on the dating system used. Most periods are
  constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past.
  The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they
  are viewed and studied.[38]The field of history generally leaves prehistory to the
  archaeologists, who have entirely different sets of tools and theories. The usual
  method for periodisation of the distant prehistoric past, in archeology is to rely
  on changes in material culture and technology, such as the Stone Age, Bronze Age
  and Iron Age and their sub-divisions also based on different styles of material
  remains. Despite the development over recent decades of the ability through radiocarbon
  dating and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts,
  these long-established schemes seem likely to remain in use. In many cases neighbouring
  cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it, which may be
  used.The Marxian theory of history identifies five stages of history:[39][40][41][42][43]The
  First Stage: is usually called primitive communism. It has the following characteristics.The
  Second Stage: may be called slave society, considered to be the beginning of "class
  society" where private property appears.The Third Stage: may be called feudalism;
  it appears after slave society collapses. This was most obvious during the European
  Middle Ages when society went from slavery to feudalism.Marx pays special attention
  to this stage in human development. The bulk of his work is devoted to analysing
  the mechanisms of capitalism, which in western society classically arose "red in
  tooth and claw" from feudal society in a revolutionary movement. In capitalism,
  the profit motive rules and people, freed from serfdom, work for the capitalists
  for wages. The capitalist class are free to spread their laissez faire practices
  around the world. In the capitalist-controlled parliament, laws are made to protect
  wealth.Capitalism may be considered the Fourth Stage in the sequence. It appears
  after the bourgeois revolution when the capitalists (or their merchant predecessors)
  overthrow the feudal system. Capitalism is categorized by the following:But according
  to Marx, capitalism, like slave society and feudalism, also has critical failings
  — inner contradictions which will lead to its downfall. The working class, to which
  the capitalist class gave birth in order to produce commodities and profits, is
  the "grave digger" of capitalism. The worker is not paid the full value of what
  he or she produces. The rest is surplus value — the capitalist''s profit, which
  Marx calls the "unpaid labour of the working class." The capitalists are forced
  by competition to attempt to drive down the wages of the working class to increase
  their profits, and this creates conflict between the classes, and gives rise to
  the development of class consciousness in the working class. The working class,
  through trade union and other struggles, becomes conscious of itself as an exploited
  class. In the view of classical Marxism, the struggles of the working class against
  the attacks of the capitalist class will eventually lead the working class to establish
  its own collective control over productionAfter the working class gains class consciousness
  and mounts a revolution against the capitalists, socialism, which may be considered
  the Fifth Stage, will be attained, if the workers are successful.Socialism may be
  characterised as follows:Marx explained that, since socialism, the first stage of
  communism, would be "in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually,
  still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges",
  each worker would naturally expect to be awarded according to the amount of labor
  he contributes, despite the fact that each worker''s ability and family circumstances
  would differ, so that the results would still be unequal at this stage, although
  fully supported by social provision.Particular geographical locations can form the
  basis of historical study, for example, continents, countries and cities. Understanding
  why historic events took place is important. To do this, historians often turn to
  geography. Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all
  affect the lives of the people who live there. For example, to explain why the ancient
  Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the geography of Egypt is
  essential. Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which
  flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks. The rich soil could help farmers
  grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities. That meant everyone did not
  have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization.Military
  history concerns warfare, strategies, battles, weapons, and the psychology of combat.
  The "new military history" since the 1970s has been concerned with soldiers more
  than generals, with psychology more than tactics, and with the broader impact of
  warfare on society and culture.[44]The history of religion has been a main theme
  for both secular and religious historians for centuries, and continues to be taught
  in seminaries and academe. Leading journals include Church History, Catholic Historical
  Review, and History of Religions. Topics range widely from political and cultural
  and artistic dimensions, to theology and liturgy.[45] This subject studies religions
  from all regions and areas of the world where humans have lived.[46]Social history,
  sometimes called the new social history, is the field that includes history of ordinary
  people and their strategies and institutions for coping with life.[47] In its "golden
  age" it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still
  is well represented in history departments. In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the
  proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social
  history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell
  from 40% to 30%.[48] In the history departments of British universities in 2007,
  of the 5723 faculty members, 1644 (29%) identified themselves with social history
  while political history came next with 1425 (25%).[49] The "old" social history
  before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often
  included political movements, like Populism, that were "social" in the sense of
  being outside the elite system. Social history was contrasted with political history,
  intellectual history and the history of great men. English historian G. M. Trevelyan
  saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting
  that, "Without social history, economic history is barren and political history
  unintelligible."[50] While the field has often been viewed negatively as history
  with the politics left out, it has also been defended as "history with the people
  put back in."[51]The chief subfields of social history include:Cultural history
  replaced social history as the dominant form in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically
  combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular
  cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines
  the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a
  group of people. How peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic.
  Cultural history includes the study of art in society as well is the study of images
  and human visual production (iconography).[52]Diplomatic history focuses on the
  relationships between nations, primarily regarding diplomacy and the causes of wars.
  More recently it looks at the causes of peace and human rights. It typically presents
  the viewpoints of the foreign office, and long-term strategic values, as the driving
  force of continuity and change in history. This type of political history is the
  study of the conduct of international relations between states or across state boundaries
  over time. Historian Muriel Chamberlain notes that after the First World War:She
  adds that after 1945, the trend reversed, allowing social history to replace it.Although
  economic history has been well established since the late 19th century, in recent
  years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and
  away from traditional history departments.[54]Business history deals with the history
  of individual business organizations, business methods, government regulation, labor
  relations, and impact on society. It also includes biographies of individual companies,
  executives, and entrepreneurs. It is related to economic history; Business history
  is most often taught in business schools.[55]Environmental history is a new field
  that emerged in the 1980s to look at the history of the environment, especially
  in the long run, and the impact of human activities upon it.[56]World history is
  the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. World history is
  primarily a teaching field, rather than a research field. It gained popularity in
  the United States,[57] Japan[58] and other countries after the 1980s with the realization
  that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds.It
  has led to highly controversial interpretations by Oswald Spengler and Arnold J.
  Toynbee, among others.The World History Association publishes the Journal of World
  History every quarter since 1990.[59] The H-World discussion list[60] serves as
  a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions
  among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews.A people''s
  history is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events
  from the perspective of common people. A people''s history is the history of the
  world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders. Individuals or groups
  not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary
  focus, which includes the disenfranchised, the oppressed, the poor, the nonconformists,
  and the otherwise forgotten people. This history also usually focuses on events
  occurring in the fullness of time, or when an overwhelming wave of smaller events
  cause certain developments to occur.Intellectual history and the history of ideas
  emerged in the mid-20th century, with the focus on the intellectuals and their books
  on the one hand, and on the other the study of ideas as disembodied objects with
  a career of their own.[61][62]Gender history is a sub-field of History and Gender
  studies, which looks at the past from the perspective of gender. It is in many ways,
  an outgrowth of women''s history. Despite its relatively short life, Gender History
  (and its forerunner Women''s History) has had a rather significant effect on the
  general study of history. Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first
  achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases,
  each with its own challenges and outcomes. Although some of the changes to the study
  of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous
  women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession,
  other influences are more subtle.Public history describes the broad range of activities
  undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally
  working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice has quite
  deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history,
  museum curatorship, and other related fields. The term itself began to be used in
  the U.S. and Canada in the late 1970s, and the field has become increasingly professionalized
  since that time. Some of the most common settings for public history are museums,
  historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television
  companies, and all levels of government.[63]Professional and amateur historians
  discover, collect, organize, and present information about past events. In lists
  of historians, historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which
  they were writing, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they
  specialized. Chroniclers and annalists, though they are not historians in the true
  sense, are also frequently included.Since the 20th century, Western historians have
  disavowed the aspiration to provide the "judgement of history."[64] The goals of
  historical judgements or interpretations are separate to those of legal judgements,
  that need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final.[65] A related
  issue to that of the judgement of history is that of collective memory.Pseudohistory
  is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart
  from standard historiographical conventions in a way which undermines their conclusions.
  Closely related to deceptive historical revisionism, works which draw controversial
  conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, particularly
  in the fields of national, political, military, and religious affairs, are often
  rejected as pseudohistory.A major intellectual battle took place in Britain in the
  early twentieth century regarding the place of history teaching in the universities.
  At Oxford and Cambridge, scholarship was downplayed. Professor Charles Harding Firth,
  Oxford''s Regius Professor of history in 1904 ridiculed the system as best suited
  to produce superficial journalists. The Oxford tutors, who had more votes than the
  professors, fought back in defense of their system saying that it successfully produced
  Britain''s outstanding statesmen, administrators, prelates, and diplomats, and that
  mission was as valuable as training scholars. The tutors dominated the debate until
  after the Second World War. It forced aspiring young scholars to teach at outlying
  schools, such as Manchester University, where T.F. Tout was professionalising the
  History undergraduate programme at by introducing the study of original sources
  and requiring the writing of a thesis.[66][67]In the United States, scholarship
  was concentrated at the major PhD-producing universities, while the large number
  of other colleges and universities focused on undergraduate teaching. A tendency
  in the 21st century was for the latter schools to increasingly demand scholarly
  productivity of their younger tenure-track faculty. Furthermore, universities have
  increasingly relied on inexpensive part-time adjuncts to do most of the classroom
  teaching.[68]From the origins of national school systems in the 19th century, the
  teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority. In the
  United States after World War I, a strong movement emerged at the university level
  to teach courses in Western Civilization, so as to give students a common heritage
  with Europe. In the U.S. after 1980 attention increasingly moved toward teaching
  world history or requiring students to take courses in non-western cultures, to
  prepare students for life in a globalized economy.[69]At the university level, historians
  debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the
  humanities. Many view the field from both perspectives.The teaching of history in
  French schools was influenced by the Nouvelle histoire as disseminated after the
  1960s by Cahiers pédagogiques and Enseignement and other journals for teachers.
  Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique,
  (INRDP). Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils children
  should learn about historians'' approaches as well as facts and dates. Louis François,
  Dean of the History/Geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education advised
  that teachers should provide historic documents and promote "active methods" which
  would give pupils "the immense happiness of discovery." Proponents said it was a
  reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching
  and left the students bored. Traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern
  innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and
  national identity.[70]In most countries history textbook are tools to foster nationalism
  and patriotism, and give students the official line about national enemies.[71]In
  many countries history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are
  written to put the national heritage in the most favorable light. For example, in
  Japan, mention of the Nanking Massacre has been removed from textbooks and the entire
  Second World War is given cursory treatment. Other countries have complained.[72]
  It was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid Marxist historiography.[73][74]Academic
  historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes
  with success.[75][76]In 21st-century Germany, the history curriculum is controlled
  by the 16 states, and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an "almost
  pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone" and reflects "principles formulated
  by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, thus oriented
  towards human rights, democracy and peace." The result is that "German textbooks
  usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding
  of citizenship centred on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and
  Europeanness."[77]'

  Nikolaos Gysis (1892)\n\n\n\n\n\nThose who cannot remember the past are condemned
  to repeat it.[1]\n\n\n—George Santayana\n\nHistory (from Greek ἱστορία, historia,
  meaning \"inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation\")[2] is the study of the
  past, particularly how it relates to humans.[3][4] It is an umbrella term that relates
  to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation,
  and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history
  are called historians. Events occurring prior to written record are considered prehistory.\nHistory
  can also refer to the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and
  analyse a sequence of past events, and objectively determine the patterns of cause
  and effect that determine them.[5][6] Historians sometimes debate the nature of
  history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in
  itself and as a way of providing \"perspective\" on the problems of the present.[5][7][8][9]\nStories
  common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the
  tales surrounding King Arthur), are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends,
  because they do not show the \"disinterested investigation\" required of the discipline
  of history.[10][11]Herodotus, a 5th-century BCE Greek historian is considered within
  the Western tradition to be the \"father of history\", and, along with his contemporary
  Thucydides, helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history. Their
  works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus
  and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in
  modern historical writing. In Asia, a state chronicle, the Spring and Autumn Annals
  was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BCE although only 2nd century BCE
  texts survived.\nAncient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of
  the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change
  today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific
  regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation.
  Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic
  study of history is a major discipline in university studies.\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1

  by Frederick Dielman (1896)\n\n\nThe word history comes ultimately from Ancient
  Greek ἱστορία[12] (historía), meaning \"inquiry\",\"knowledge from inquiry\", or
  \"judge\". It was in that sense that Aristotle used the word in his Περὶ Τὰ Ζῷα
  Ἱστορίαι[13] (Perì Tà Zôa Ηistoríai \"Inquiries about Animals\"). The ancestor word
  ἵστωρ is attested early on in Homeric Hymns, Heraclitus, the Athenian ephebes' oath,
  and in Boiotic inscriptions (in a legal sense, either \"judge\" or \"witness\",
  or similar).\nThe Greek word was borrowed into Classical Latin as historia, meaning
  'investigation, inquiry, research, account, description, written account of past
  events, writing of history, historical narrative, recorded knowledge of past events,
  story, narrative'. History was borrowed from Latin (possibly via Old Irish or Old
  Welsh) into Old English as stær ('history, narrative, story'), but this word fell
  out of use in the late Old English period.[14]\nMeanwhile, as Latin became Old French
  (and Anglo-Norman), historia developed into forms such as istorie, estoire, and
  historie, with new developments in the meaning: 'account of the events of a person's
  life (beginning of the 12th cent.), chronicle, account of events as relevant to
  a group of people or people in general (1155), dramatic or pictorial representation
  of historical events (c1240), body of knowledge relative to human evolution, science
  (c1265), narrative of real or imaginary events, story (c1462)'.[14]\nIt was from
  Anglo-Norman that history was borrowed into Middle English, and this time the loan
  stuck. It appears in the thirteenth-century Ancrene Riwle, but seems to have become
  a common word in the late fourteenth century, with an early attestation appearing
  in John Gower's Confessio Amantis of the 1390s (VI.1383): 'I finde in a bok compiled
  | To this matiere an old histoire, | The which comth nou to mi memoire'. In Middle
  English, the meaning of history was \"story\" in general. The restriction to the
  meaning 'the branch of knowledge that deals with past events; the formal record
  or study of past events, esp. human affairs' arose in the mid-fifteenth century.[14]\nWith
  the Renaissance, older senses of the word were revived, and it was in the Greek
  sense that Francis Bacon used the term in the late sixteenth century, when he wrote
  about \"Natural History\". For him, historia was \"the knowledge of objects determined
  by space and time\", that sort of knowledge provided by memory (while science was
  provided by reason, and poetry was provided by fantasy).[15]\nIn an expression of
  the linguistic synthetic vs. analytic/isolating dichotomy, English like Chinese
  (史 vs. 诌) now designates separate words for human history and storytelling in general.
  In modern German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly
  synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both \"history\"
  and \"story\".\nThe adjective historical is attested from 1661, and historic from
  1669.[16]\nHistorian in the sense of a \"researcher of history\" is attested from
  1531. In all European languages, the substantive \"history\" is still used to mean
  both \"what happened with men\", and \"the scholarly study of the happened\", the
  latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, \"History\", or the
  word historiography.[13]\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nThe title page to The Historians'
  History of the World\n\n\nHistorians write in the context of their own time, and
  with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and
  sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society. In the words of Benedetto
  Croce, \"All history is contemporary history\". History is facilitated by the formation
  of a 'true discourse of past' through the production of narrative and analysis of
  past events relating to the human race.[17] The modern discipline of history is
  dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.\nAll events that are
  remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record.[18]
  The task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully
  contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past. Therefore, the constitution
  of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive
  by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims
  to represent the 'true past').\nThe study of history has sometimes been classified
  as part of the humanities and at other times as part of the social sciences.[19]
  It can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies
  from both. Some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification.[20]
  In the 20th century, French historian Fernand Braudel revolutionized the study of
  history, by using such outside disciplines as economics, anthropology, and geography
  in the study of global history.\nTraditionally, historians have recorded events
  of the past, either in writing or by passing on an oral tradition, and have attempted
  to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts.
  From the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions,
  and pictures. In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into
  three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved,
  and historians often consult all three.[21] But writing is the marker that separates
  history from what comes before.\nArchaeology is a discipline that is especially
  helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects, which, once unearthed, contribute
  to the study of history. But archaeology rarely stands alone. It uses narrative
  sources to complement its discoveries. However, archaeology is constituted by a
  range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history; that is
  to say, archaeology does not \"fill the gaps\" within textual sources. Indeed, \"historical
  archaeology\" is a specific branch of archaeology, often contrasting its conclusions
  against those of contemporary textual sources. For example, Mark Leone, the excavator
  and interpreter of historical Annapolis, Maryland, USA; has sought to understand
  the contradiction between textual documents and the material record, demonstrating
  the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of
  the total historical environment, despite the ideology of \"liberty\" inherent in
  written documents at this time.\nThere are varieties of ways in which history can
  be organized, including chronologically, culturally, territorially, and thematically.
  These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant overlaps are often present,
  as in \"The International Women's Movement in an Age of Transition, 1830–1975.\"
  It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific
  and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization.
  The area called Big History resists this specialization, and searches for universal
  patterns or trends. History has often been studied with some practical or theoretical
  aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.[22]\nHistory

  is the memory of the past experience of Homo sapiens sapiens around the world, as
  that experience has been preserved, largely in written records. By \"prehistory\",
  historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written
  records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. By studying
  painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered
  even in the absence of a written record. Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory
  is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations,
  such as those of Sub-Saharan Africa and pre-Columbian America. Historians in the
  West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the Western world.[23]
  In 1961, British historian E. H. Carr wrote:\n\nThe line of demarcation between
  prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease to live only in the
  present, and become consciously interested both in their past and in their future.
  History begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition means the carrying
  of the habits and lessons of the past into the future. Records of the past begin
  to be kept for the benefit of future generations.[24]\n\nThis definition includes
  within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as Australian
  Aboriginals and New Zealand Māori in the past, and the oral records maintained and
  transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with European civilization.\nHistoriography\nMain
  article: Historiography\n\n\n\n\nThe title page to\"La Historia d'Italia\"\n\n\nHistoriography
  has a number of related meanings. Firstly, it can refer to how history has been
  produced: the story of the development of methodology and practices (for example,
  the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis).
  Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical
  writing (for example, \"medieval historiography during the 1960s\" means \"Works
  of medieval history written during the 1960s\"). Thirdly, it may refer to why history
  is produced: the Philosophy of history. As a meta-level analysis of descriptions
  of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis
  usually focuses on the narratives, interpretations, worldview, use of evidence,
  or method of presentation of other historians. Professional historians also debate
  the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or
  a series of competing narratives.[25][26]\nPhilosophy of history\n\nHistory's philosophical
  questions\nWhat is the proper unit for the study of the human past—the individual?
  The polis? The civilization? The culture? Or the nation state?\nAre there broad
  patterns and progress? Are there cycles? Is human history random and devoid of any
  meaning?\n\nMain article: Philosophy of history\nPhilosophy of history is a branch
  of philosophy concerning the eventual significance, if any, of human history. Furthermore,
  it speculates as to a possible teleological end to its development—that is, it asks
  if there is a design, purpose, directive principle, or finality in the processes
  of human history. Philosophy of history should not be confused with historiography,
  which is the study of history as an academic discipline, and thus concerns its methods
  and practices, and its development as a discipline over time. Nor should philosophy
  of history be confused with the history of philosophy, which is the study of the
  development of philosophical ideas through time.\nHistorical methods\nFurther information:
  Historical method\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA depiction of the ancient Library of Alexandria\n\n\n\nHistorical
  method basics\nThe following questions are used by historians in modern work.\nWhen
  was the source, written or unwritten, produced (date)?\nWhere was it produced (localization)?\nBy
  whom was it produced (authorship)?\nFrom what pre-existing material was it produced
  (analysis)?\nIn what original form was it produced (integrity)?\nWhat is the evidential
  value of its contents (credibility)?\nThe first four are known as higher criticism;
  the fifth, lower criticism; and, together, external criticism. The sixth and final
  inquiry about a source is called internal criticism.\n\nThe historical method comprises
  the techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other
  evidence to research and then to write history.\nHerodotus of Halicarnassus (484
  BC – ca.425 BC)[27] has generally been acclaimed as the \"father of history\". However,
  his contemporary Thucydides (ca. 460 BC – ca. 400 BC) is credited with having first
  approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the History
  of the Peloponnesian War. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being
  the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and
  effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention.[27] In his historical
  method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, a neutral point of view, and that the
  human world was the result of the actions of human beings. Greek historians also
  viewed history as cyclical, with events regularly recurring.[28]\nThere were historical
  traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval China.
  The groundwork for professional historiography in East Asia was established by the
  Han Dynasty court historian known as Sima Qian (145–90 BC), author of the Shiji
  (Records of the Grand Historian). For the quality of his written work, Sima Qian
  is posthumously known as the Father of Chinese Historiography. Chinese historians
  of subsequent dynastic periods in China used his Shiji as the official format for
  historical texts, as well as for biographical literature.[citation needed]\nSaint
  Augustine was influential in Christian and Western thought at the beginning of the
  medieval period. Through the Medieval and Renaissance periods, history was often
  studied through a sacred or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher
  and historian Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel brought philosophy and a more secular
  approach in historical study.[22]\nIn the preface to his book, the Muqaddimah (1377),
  the Arab historian and early sociologist, Ibn Khaldun, warned of seven mistakes
  that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached
  the past as strange and in need of interpretation. The originality of Ibn Khaldun
  was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation
  of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which
  it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for
  experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of
  the past. Ibn Khaldun often criticized \"idle superstition and uncritical acceptance
  of historical data.\" As a result, he introduced a scientific method to the study
  of history, and he often referred to it as his \"new science\".[29] His historical
  method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state, communication,
  propaganda and systematic bias in history,[30] and he is thus considered to be the
  \"father of historiography\"[31][32] or the \"father of the philosophy of history\".[33]\nIn
  the West, historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and
  18th centuries, especially in France and Germany. The 19th-century historian with
  greatest influence on methods was Leopold von Ranke in Germany.\nIn the 20th century,
  academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended
  to glorify the nation or great men, to more objective and complex analyses of social
  and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century
  was a tendency to treat history more as a social science rather than as an art,
  which traditionally had been the case. Some of the leading advocates of history
  as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included Fernand
  Braudel, E. H. Carr, Fritz Fischer, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Hans-Ulrich Wehler,
  Bruce Trigger, Marc Bloch, Karl Dietrich Bracher, Peter Gay, Robert Fogel, Lucien
  Febvre and Lawrence Stone. Many of the advocates of history as a social science
  were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach. Braudel combined history
  with geography, Bracher history with political science, Fogel history with economics,
  Gay history with psychology, Trigger history with archaeology while Wehler, Bloch,
  Fischer, Stone, Febvre and Le Roy Ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated
  history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics. More recently, the
  field of digital history has begun to address ways of using computer technology
  to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.\nIn opposition
  to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as Hugh Trevor-Roper,
  John Lukacs, Donald Creighton, Gertrude Himmelfarb and Gerhard Ritter argued that
  the key to the historians' work was the power of the imagination, and hence contended
  that history should be understood as an art. French historians associated with the
  Annales School introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives
  of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of cultural history
  (cf. histoire des mentalités). Intellectual historians such as Herbert Butterfield,
  Ernst Nolte and George Mosse have argued for the significance of ideas in history.
  American historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked
  ethnic, racial, and socio-economic groups. Another genre of social history to emerge
  in the post-WWII era was Alltagsgeschichte (History of Everyday Life). Scholars
  such as Martin Broszat, Ian Kershaw and Detlev Peukert sought to examine what everyday
  life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century Germany, especially in the Nazi
  period.\nMarxist historians such as Eric Hobsbawm, E. P. Thompson, Rodney Hilton,
  Georges Lefebvre, Eugene D. Genovese, Isaac Deutscher, C. L. R. James, Timothy Mason,
  Herbert Aptheker, Arno J. Mayer and Christopher Hill have sought to validate Karl
  Marx's theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to
  the Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as François Furet, Richard
  Pipes, J. C. D. Clark, Roland Mousnier, Henry Ashby Turner and Robert Conquest have
  offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history. Feminist historians such as Joan
  Wallach Scott, Claudia Koonz, Natalie Zemon Davis, Sheila Rowbotham, Gisela Bock,
  Gerda Lerner, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, and Lynn Hunt have argued for the importance
  of studying the experience of women in the past. In recent years, postmodernists
  have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that
  all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. In his 1997 book
  In Defence of History, Richard J. Evans, a professor of modern history at Cambridge
  University, defended the worth of history. Another defence of history from post-modernist
  criticism was the Australian historian Keith Windschuttle's 1994 book, The Killing
  of History.\nMarxian theory of history\nMain article: Marx's theory of history\nThe
  Marxist theory of historical materialism theorises that society is fundamentally
  determined by the material conditions at any given time – in other words, the relationships
  which people have with each other in order to fulfil basic needs such as feeding,
  clothing and housing themselves and their families.[34] Overall, Marx and Engels
  claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material
  conditions in Western Europe.[35] Marxist historiography was once orthodoxy in the
  Soviet Union, but since the collapse of communism there in 1991, Mikhail Krom says
  it has been reduced to the margins of scholarship.[36]\nStages of history\nMarx
  observed that each stage or epoch created a new class or invention that would lead
  to its downfall. However the downfall would not be an automatically negative event,
  since with each step humanity at large would benefit. Each passing stage would therefore
  raise the standard of living of the masses while at the same time be doomed to its
  own downfall because of internal contradictions and class conflicts.\nThe first
  three stages are not given particular attention, since by Marx's time they had long
  come to pass. As such, he does not provide the principles of these stages as he
  does for capitalism and the stages that follow. Nonetheless, these epochs have common
  characteristics.\nAreas of study\n\n\nParticular studies and fields\n\n\n\nThese
  are approaches to history; not listed are histories of other fields, such as history
  of science, history of mathematics and history of philosophy.\nAncient history :
  the study from the beginning of human history until the Early Middle Ages.\nAtlantic
  history: the study of the history of people living on or near the Atlantic Ocean.\nArt
  History: the study of changes in and social context of art.\nComparative history:
  historical analysis of social and cultural entities not confined to national boundaries.\nContemporary
  history: the study of recent historical events.\nCounterfactual history: the study
  of historical events as they might have happened in different causal circumstances.\nCultural
  history: the study of culture in the past.\nDigital History: the use of computing
  technologies do massive searches in published sources.\nEconomic History: the use
  of economic models fitted to the past.\nIntellectual history: the study of ideas
  in the context of the cultures that produced them and their development over time.\nMaritime
  history: the study of maritime transport and all the connected subjects.\nModern
  history : the study of the Modern Times, the era after the Middle Ages.\nMilitary
  History: the study of warfare and wars in history and what is sometimes considered
  to be a sub-branch of military history, Naval History.\nPaleography: study of ancient
  texts.\nPeople's history: historical work from the perspective of common people.\nPolitical
  history: the study of politics in the past.\nPsychohistory: study of the psychological
  motivations of historical events.\nPseudohistory: study about the past that falls
  outside the domain of mainstream history (sometimes it is an equivalent of pseudoscience).\nSocial
  History: the study of the process of social change throughout history.\nWomen's
  history: the history of female human beings. Gender history is related and covers
  the perspective of gender.\nWorld History: the study of history from a global perspective,
  with special attention to non-Western societies.\n\nPeriods\nMain article: Periodization\nHistorical
  study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of
  time. Historians give these periods of time names in order to allow \"organising
  ideas and classificatory generalisations\" to be used by historians.[37] The names
  given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the start
  and end of a particular period. Centuries and decades are commonly used periods
  and the time they represent depends on the dating system used. Most periods are
  constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past.
  The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they
  are viewed and studied.[38]\nPrehistoric periodisation\nThe field of history generally
  leaves prehistory to the archaeologists, who have entirely different sets of tools
  and theories. The usual method for periodisation of the distant prehistoric past,
  in archeology is to rely on changes in material culture and technology, such as
  the Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age and their sub-divisions also based on different
  styles of material remains. Despite the development over recent decades of the ability
  through radiocarbon dating and other scientific methods to give actual dates for
  many sites or artefacts, these long-established schemes seem likely to remain in
  use. In many cases neighbouring cultures with writing have left some history of
  cultures without it, which may be used.\nStages of history\nMain article: Marx's
  theory of history § The stages of history\nThe Marxian theory of history identifies
  five stages of history:[39][40][41][42][43]\nPrimitive communism\nThe First Stage:
  is usually called primitive communism. It has the following characteristics.\nShared
  property: there is no concept of ownership beyond individual possessions. All is
  shared by the tribe to ensure its survival.[citation needed]\nHunting and gathering:
  tribal societies have yet to develop large scale agriculture and so their survival
  is a daily struggle.[citation needed]\nProto-democracy: there is usually no concept
  of \"leadership\" yet. So tribes are led by the best warrior if there is war, the
  best diplomat if they have steady contact with other tribes and so forth.\nSlave
  society\nThe Second Stage: may be called slave society, considered to be the beginning
  of \"class society\" where private property appears.\nClass: here the idea of class
  appears. There is always a slave-owning ruling class and the slaves themselves.\nStatism:
  the state develops during this stage as a tool for the slave-owners to use and control
  the slaves.\nAgriculture: people learn to cultivate plants and animals on a large
  enough scale to support large populations.\nDemocracy and authoritarianism: these
  opposites develop at the same stage. Democracy arises first with the development
  of the republican city-state, followed by the totalitarian empire.\nPrivate property:
  citizens now own more than personal property. Land ownership is especially important
  during a time of agricultural development.\nFeudalism\nThe Third Stage: may be called
  feudalism; it appears after slave society collapses. This was most obvious during
  the European Middle Ages when society went from slavery to feudalism.\nAristocracy:
  the state is ruled by monarchs who inherit their positions, or at times marry or
  conquer their ways into leadership.\nTheocracy: this is a time of largely religious
  rule. When there is only one religion in the land and its organizations affect all
  parts of daily life.\nHereditary classes: castes can sometimes form and one's class
  is determined at birth with no form of advancement. This was the case with India.\nNation-state:
  nations are formed from the remnants of the fallen empires. Sometimes to rebuild
  themselves into empires once more. Such as England's transition from a province
  to an empire.\nCapitalism\nMarx pays special attention to this stage in human development.
  The bulk of his work is devoted to analysing the mechanisms of capitalism, which
  in western society classically arose \"red in tooth and claw\" from feudal society
  in a revolutionary movement. In capitalism, the profit motive rules and people,
  freed from serfdom, work for the capitalists for wages. The capitalist class are
  free to spread their laissez faire practices around the world. In the capitalist-controlled
  parliament, laws are made to protect wealth.\nCapitalism may be considered the Fourth
  Stage in the sequence. It appears after the bourgeois revolution when the capitalists
  (or their merchant predecessors) overthrow the feudal system. Capitalism is categorized
  by the following:\nMarket economy: In capitalism, the entire economy is guided by
  market forces. Supporters of laissez faire economics argue that there should be
  little or no intervention from the government under capitalism. Marxists, however,
  such as Lenin in his Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, argue that the
  capitalist government is a powerful instrument for the furtherance of capitalism
  and the capitalist nation-state, particularly in the conquest of markets abroad.\nPrivate
  property: The means of production are no longer in the hands of the monarchy and
  its nobles, but rather they are controlled by the capitalists. The capitalists control
  the means of production through commercial enterprises (such as corporations) which
  aim to maximise profit.\nParliamentary democracy: The capitalists tend to govern
  through an elected centralised parliament or congress, rather than under an autocracy.
  Capitalist (bourgeois) democracy, although it may be extended to the whole population,
  does not necessarily lead to universal suffrage. Historically it has excluded (by
  force, segregation, legislation or other means) sections of the population such
  as women, slaves, ex-slaves, people of colour or those on low income. The government
  acts on behalf of, and is controlled by, the capitalists through various methods.\nWages:
  In capitalism, workers are rewarded according to their contract with their employer.
  Power elites propagate the illusion that market forces mean wages converge to an
  equilibrium at which workers are paid for precisely the value of their services.
  In reality workers are paid less than the value of their productivity — the difference
  forming profit for the employer. In this sense all paid employment is exploitation
  and the worker is \"alienated\" from their work. Insofar as the profit-motive drives
  the market, it is impossible for workers to be paid for the full value of their
  labour, as all employers will act in the same manner.\nImperialism: Wealthy countries
  seek to dominate poorer countries in order to gain access to raw materials and to
  provide captive markets for finished products. This is done directly through war,
  the threat of war, or the export of capital. The capitalist's control over the state
  can play an essential part in the development of capitalism, to the extent the state
  directs warfare and other foreign intervention.\nFinancial institutions: Banks and
  capital markets such as stock exchanges direct unused capital to where it is needed.
  They reduce barriers to entry in all markets, especially to the poor; it is in this
  way that banks dramatically improve class mobility.\nMonopolistic tendencies: The
  natural, unrestrained market forces will create monopolies from the most successful
  commercial entities.\nBut according to Marx, capitalism, like slave society and
  feudalism, also has critical failings — inner contradictions which will lead to
  its downfall. The working class, to which the capitalist class gave birth in order
  to produce commodities and profits, is the \"grave digger\" of capitalism. The worker
  is not paid the full value of what he or she produces. The rest is surplus value
  — the capitalist's profit, which Marx calls the \"unpaid labour of the working class.\"
  The capitalists are forced by competition to attempt to drive down the wages of
  the working class to increase their profits, and this creates conflict between the
  classes, and gives rise to the development of class consciousness in the working
  class. The working class, through trade union and other struggles, becomes conscious
  of itself as an exploited class. In the view of classical Marxism, the struggles
  of the working class against the attacks of the capitalist class will eventually
  lead the working class to establish its own collective control over production\nSocialism\nAfter
  the working class gains class consciousness and mounts a revolution against the
  capitalists, socialism, which may be considered the Fifth Stage, will be attained,
  if the workers are successful.\nSocialism may be characterised as follows:\nCommon
  property: the means of production are taken from the hands of a few capitalists
  and put in the hands of the workers. This translates into the democratic communes
  controlling the means of production.\nCouncil democracy: Marx, basing himself on
  a thorough study of Paris Commune, believed that the workers would govern themselves
  through system of communes. He called this the dictatorship of the proletariat,
  which, overthrowing the dictatorship (governance) of capital, would democratically
  plan production and the resources of the planet.\nMarx explained that, since socialism,
  the first stage of communism, would be \"in every respect, economically, morally,
  and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose
  womb it emerges\", each worker would naturally expect to be awarded according to
  the amount of labor he contributes, despite the fact that each worker's ability
  and family circumstances would differ, so that the results would still be unequal
  at this stage, although fully supported by social provision.\nGeographical locations\nParticular
  geographical locations can form the basis of historical study, for example, continents,
  countries and cities. Understanding why historic events took place is important.
  To do this, historians often turn to geography. Weather patterns, the water supply,
  and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there.
  For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization,
  studying the geography of Egypt is essential. Egyptian civilization was built on
  the banks of the Nile River, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks.
  The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities.
  That meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs
  that helped develop the civilization.\nRegions\nHistory of Africa begins with the
  first emergence of modern human beings on the continent, continuing into its modern
  present as a patchwork of diverse and politically developing nation states.\nHistory
  of the Americas is the collective history of North and South America, including
  Central America and the Caribbean.\nHistory of North America is the study of the
  past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's northern
  and western hemisphere.\nHistory of Central America is the study of the past passed
  down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's western hemisphere.\nHistory
  of the Caribbean begins with the oldest evidence where 7,000-year-old remains have
  been found.\nHistory of South America is the study of the past passed down from
  generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's southern and western hemisphere.\n\nHistory
  of Antarctica emerges from early Western theories of a vast continent, known as
  Terra Australis, believed to exist in the far south of the globe.\nHistory of Australia
  starts with the documentation of the Makassar trading with Indigenous Australians
  on Australia's north coast.\nHistory of New Zealand dates back at least 700 years
  to when it was discovered and settled by Polynesians, who developed a distinct Māori
  culture centred on kinship links and land.\nHistory of the Pacific Islands covers
  the history of the islands in the Pacific Ocean.\nHistory of Eurasia is the collective
  history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions: the Middle East, South Asia,
  East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Europe, linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian
  steppe of Central Asia and Eastern Europe.\nHistory of Europe describes the passage
  of time from humans inhabiting the European continent to the present day.\nHistory
  of Asia can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal
  regions, East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East linked by the interior mass
  of the Eurasian steppe.\nHistory of East Asia is the study of the past passed down
  from generation to generation in East Asia.\nHistory of the Middle East begins with
  the earliest civilizations in the region now known as the Middle East that were
  established around 3000 BC, in Mesopotamia (Iraq).\nHistory of South Asia is the
  study of the past passed down from generation to generation in the Sub-Himalayan
  region.\nHistory of Southeast Asia has been characterized as interaction between
  regional players and foreign powers.\n\n\nMilitary history\nMain article: Military
  history\nMilitary history concerns warfare, strategies, battles, weapons, and the
  psychology of combat. The \"new military history\" since the 1970s has been concerned
  with soldiers more than generals, with psychology more than tactics, and with the
  broader impact of warfare on society and culture.[44]\nHistory of religion\nMain
  article: Religious history\nThe history of religion has been a main theme for both
  secular and religious historians for centuries, and continues to be taught in seminaries
  and academe. Leading journals include Church History, Catholic Historical Review,
  and History of Religions. Topics range widely from political and cultural and artistic
  dimensions, to theology and liturgy.[45] This subject studies religions from all
  regions and areas of the world where humans have lived.[46]\nSocial history\nMain
  article: Social history\nSocial history, sometimes called the new social history,
  is the field that includes history of ordinary people and their strategies and institutions
  for coping with life.[47] In its \"golden age\" it was a major growth field in the
  1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments.
  In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American
  universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion
  of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.[48] In the history departments of
  British universities in 2007, of the 5723 faculty members, 1644 (29%) identified
  themselves with social history while political history came next with 1425 (25%).[49]
  The \"old\" social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a
  central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were
  \"social\" in the sense of being outside the elite system. Social history was contrasted
  with political history, intellectual history and the history of great men. English
  historian G. M. Trevelyan saw it as the bridging point between economic and political
  history, reflecting that, \"Without social history, economic history is barren and
  political history unintelligible.\"[50] While the field has often been viewed negatively
  as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as \"history with
  the people put back in.\"[51]\nSubfields\nThe chief subfields of social history
  include:\n\nDemographic history\nBlack history\nHistory of education\nEthnic history\n\n\nFamily
  history\nLabor history\nRural history\nUrban history\n\nCultural history\nMain article:
  Cultural history\nCultural history replaced social history as the dominant form
  in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically combines the approaches of anthropology and
  history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations
  of historical experience. It examines the records and narrative descriptions of
  past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people. How peoples constructed
  their memory of the past is a major topic. Cultural history includes the study of
  art in society as well is the study of images and human visual production (iconography).[52]\nDiplomatic
  history\nMain article: Diplomatic history\nDiplomatic history focuses on the relationships
  between nations, primarily regarding diplomacy and the causes of wars. More recently
  it looks at the causes of peace and human rights. It typically presents the viewpoints
  of the foreign office, and long-term strategic values, as the driving force of continuity
  and change in history. This type of political history is the study of the conduct
  of international relations between states or across state boundaries over time.
  Historian Muriel Chamberlain notes that after the First World War:\ndiplomatic history
  replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation, at
  once the most important, most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies.[53]\nShe
  adds that after 1945, the trend reversed, allowing social history to replace it.\nEconomic
  history\nMain articles: Economic history and Business history\nAlthough economic
  history has been well established since the late 19th century, in recent years academic
  studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and away from traditional
  history departments.[54]Business history deals with the history of individual business
  organizations, business methods, government regulation, labor relations, and impact
  on society. It also includes biographies of individual companies, executives, and
  entrepreneurs. It is related to economic history; Business history is most often
  taught in business schools.[55]\nEnvironmental history\nMain article: Environmental
  history\nEnvironmental history is a new field that emerged in the 1980s to look
  at the history of the environment, especially in the long run, and the impact of
  human activities upon it.[56]\nWorld history\nMain article: World history\nSee also:
  History of the world and Universal history\nWorld history is the study of major
  civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. World history is primarily a teaching
  field, rather than a research field. It gained popularity in the United States,[57]
  Japan[58] and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students
  need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds.\nIt has led to highly
  controversial interpretations by Oswald Spengler and Arnold J. Toynbee, among others.\nThe
  World History Association publishes the Journal of World History every quarter since
  1990.[59] The H-World discussion list[60] serves as a network of communication among
  practitioners of world history, with discussions among scholars, announcements,
  syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews.\nPeople's history\nMain article: People's
  history\nA people's history is a type of historical work which attempts to account
  for historical events from the perspective of common people. A people's history
  is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders.
  Individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history
  are the primary focus, which includes the disenfranchised, the oppressed, the poor,
  the nonconformists, and the otherwise forgotten people. This history also usually
  focuses on events occurring in the fullness of time, or when an overwhelming wave
  of smaller events cause certain developments to occur.\nIntellectual history\nMain
  articles: Intellectual history and History of ideas\nIntellectual history and the
  history of ideas emerged in the mid-20th century, with the focus on the intellectuals
  and their books on the one hand, and on the other the study of ideas as disembodied
  objects with a career of their own.[61][62]\nGender history\nMain article: Gender
  history\nGender history is a sub-field of History and Gender studies, which looks
  at the past from the perspective of gender. It is in many ways, an outgrowth of
  women's history. Despite its relatively short life, Gender History (and its forerunner
  Women's History) has had a rather significant effect on the general study of history.
  Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance,
  it has gone through a number of different phases, each with its own challenges and
  outcomes. Although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious,
  such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater
  numbers of women into the historical profession, other influences are more subtle.\nPublic
  history\nMain article: Public history\nPublic history describes the broad range
  of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history
  who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history
  practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science,
  oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields. The term itself began
  to be used in the U.S. and Canada in the late 1970s, and the field has become increasingly
  professionalized since that time. Some of the most common settings for public history
  are museums, historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film
  and television companies, and all levels of government.[63]\nHistorians\nMain article:
  List of historians\n\n\n\n\nBenedetto Croce\n\n\nProfessional and amateur historians
  discover, collect, organize, and present information about past events. In lists
  of historians, historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which
  they were writing, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they
  specialized. Chroniclers and annalists, though they are not historians in the true
  sense, are also frequently included.\nThe judgement of history\nSince the 20th century,
  Western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide the \"judgement of history.\"[64]
  The goals of historical judgements or interpretations are separate to those of legal
  judgements, that need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final.[65]
  A related issue to that of the judgement of history is that of collective memory.\nSee
  also: Ash heap of history\nPseudohistory\nMain article: Pseudohistory\nPseudohistory
  is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart
  from standard historiographical conventions in a way which undermines their conclusions.
  Closely related to deceptive historical revisionism, works which draw controversial
  conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, particularly
  in the fields of national, political, military, and religious affairs, are often
  rejected as pseudohistory.\nTeaching history\nScholarship vs teaching\nA major intellectual
  battle took place in Britain in the early twentieth century regarding the place
  of history teaching in the universities. At Oxford and Cambridge, scholarship was
  downplayed. Professor Charles Harding Firth, Oxford's Regius Professor of history
  in 1904 ridiculed the system as best suited to produce superficial journalists.
  The Oxford tutors, who had more votes than the professors, fought back in defense
  of their system saying that it successfully produced Britain's outstanding statesmen,
  administrators, prelates, and diplomats, and that mission was as valuable as training
  scholars. The tutors dominated the debate until after the Second World War. It forced
  aspiring young scholars to teach at outlying schools, such as Manchester University,
  where T.F. Tout was professionalising the History undergraduate programme at by
  introducing the study of original sources and requiring the writing of a thesis.[66][67]\nIn
  the United States, scholarship was concentrated at the major PhD-producing universities,
  while the large number of other colleges and universities focused on undergraduate
  teaching. A tendency in the 21st century was for the latter schools to increasingly
  demand scholarly productivity of their younger tenure-track faculty. Furthermore,
  universities have increasingly relied on inexpensive part-time adjuncts to do most
  of the classroom teaching.[68]\nNationalism\nFrom the origins of national school
  systems in the 19th century, the teaching of history to promote national sentiment
  has been a high priority. In the United States after World War I, a strong movement
  emerged at the university level to teach courses in Western Civilization, so as
  to give students a common heritage with Europe. In the U.S. after 1980 attention
  increasingly moved toward teaching world history or requiring students to take courses
  in non-western cultures, to prepare students for life in a globalized economy.[69]\nAt
  the university level, historians debate the question of whether history belongs
  more to social science or to the humanities. Many view the field from both perspectives.\nThe
  teaching of history in French schools was influenced by the Nouvelle histoire as
  disseminated after the 1960s by Cahiers pédagogiques and Enseignement and other
  journals for teachers. Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et
  de documentation pédagogique, (INRDP). Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher
  training, said pupils children should learn about historians' approaches as well
  as facts and dates. Louis François, Dean of the History/Geography group in the Inspectorate
  of National Education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and
  promote \"active methods\" which would give pupils \"the immense happiness of discovery.\"
  Proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that
  characterized teaching and left the students bored. Traditionalists protested loudly
  it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French
  patriotism and national identity.[70]\nBias in school teaching\n\n\n\n\nHistory
  books in a bookstore.\n\n\nIn most countries history textbook are tools to foster
  nationalism and patriotism, and give students the official line about national enemies.[71]\nIn
  many countries history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are
  written to put the national heritage in the most favorable light. For example, in
  Japan, mention of the Nanking Massacre has been removed from textbooks and the entire
  Second World War is given cursory treatment. Other countries have complained.[72]
  It was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid Marxist historiography.[73][74]\nAcademic
  historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes
  with success.[75][76]\nIn 21st-century Germany, the history curriculum is controlled
  by the 16 states, and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an \"almost
  pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone\" and reflects \"principles formulated
  by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, thus oriented
  towards human rights, democracy and peace.\" The result is that \"German textbooks
  usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding
  of citizenship centred on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and
  Europeanness.\"[77]\nSee also\n\n\nBook: History\n\n\n\nHistory portal\n\nMain articles:

  /* @nomin */\n} );Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.[1]History
  (from Greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning \"inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation\")[2]
  is the study of the past, particularly how it relates to humans.[3][4] It is an
  umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection,
  organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events.
  Scholars who write about history are called historians. Events occurring prior to
  written record are considered prehistory.History can also refer to the academic
  discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events,
  and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them.[5][6]
  Historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing
  the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing \"perspective\"
  on the problems of the present.[5][7][8][9]Stories common to a particular culture,
  but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding King Arthur),
  are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends, because they do not show
  the \"disinterested investigation\" required of the discipline of history.[10][11]Herodotus,
  a 5th-century BCE Greek historian is considered within the Western tradition to
  be the \"father of history\", and, along with his contemporary Thucydides, helped
  form the foundations for the modern study of human history. Their works continue
  to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused
  Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing.
  In Asia, a state chronicle, the Spring and Autumn Annals was known to be compiled
  from as early as 722 BCE although only 2nd century BCE texts survived.Ancient influences
  have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved
  over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is
  wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain
  topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught
  as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is
  a major discipline in university studies.The word history comes ultimately from
  Ancient Greek ἱστορία[12] (historía), meaning \"inquiry\",\"knowledge from inquiry\",
  or \"judge\". It was in that sense that Aristotle used the word in his Περὶ Τὰ Ζῷα
  Ἱστορίαι[13] (Perì Tà Zôa Ηistoríai \"Inquiries about Animals\"). The ancestor word
  ἵστωρ is attested early on in Homeric Hymns, Heraclitus, the Athenian ephebes' oath,
  and in Boiotic inscriptions (in a legal sense, either \"judge\" or \"witness\",
  or similar).The Greek word was borrowed into Classical Latin as historia, meaning
  'investigation, inquiry, research, account, description, written account of past
  events, writing of history, historical narrative, recorded knowledge of past events,
  story, narrative'. History was borrowed from Latin (possibly via Old Irish or Old
  Welsh) into Old English as stær ('history, narrative, story'), but this word fell
  out of use in the late Old English period.[14]Meanwhile, as Latin became Old French
  (and Anglo-Norman), historia developed into forms such as istorie, estoire, and
  historie, with new developments in the meaning: 'account of the events of a person's
  life (beginning of the 12th cent.), chronicle, account of events as relevant to
  a group of people or people in general (1155), dramatic or pictorial representation
  of historical events (c1240), body of knowledge relative to human evolution, science
  (c1265), narrative of real or imaginary events, story (c1462)'.[14]It was from Anglo-Norman
  that history was borrowed into Middle English, and this time the loan stuck. It
  appears in the thirteenth-century Ancrene Riwle, but seems to have become a common
  word in the late fourteenth century, with an early attestation appearing in John
  Gower's Confessio Amantis of the 1390s (VI.1383): 'I finde in a bok compiled | To
  this matiere an old histoire, | The which comth nou to mi memoire'. In Middle English,
  the meaning of history was \"story\" in general. The restriction to the meaning
  'the branch of knowledge that deals with past events; the formal record or study
  of past events, esp. human affairs' arose in the mid-fifteenth century.[14]With
  the Renaissance, older senses of the word were revived, and it was in the Greek
  sense that Francis Bacon used the term in the late sixteenth century, when he wrote
  about \"Natural History\". For him, historia was \"the knowledge of objects determined
  by space and time\", that sort of knowledge provided by memory (while science was
  provided by reason, and poetry was provided by fantasy).[15]In an expression of
  the linguistic synthetic vs. analytic/isolating dichotomy, English like Chinese
  (史 vs. 诌) now designates separate words for human history and storytelling in general.
  In modern German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly
  synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both \"history\"
  and \"story\".The adjective historical is attested from 1661, and historic from
  1669.[16]Historian in the sense of a \"researcher of history\" is attested from
  1531. In all European languages, the substantive \"history\" is still used to mean
  both \"what happened with men\", and \"the scholarly study of the happened\", the
  latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, \"History\", or the
  word historiography.[13]Historians write in the context of their own time, and with
  due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and sometimes
  write to provide lessons for their own society. In the words of Benedetto Croce,
  \"All history is contemporary history\". History is facilitated by the formation
  of a 'true discourse of past' through the production of narrative and analysis of
  past events relating to the human race.[17] The modern discipline of history is
  dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.All events that are
  remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record.[18]
  The task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully
  contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past. Therefore, the constitution
  of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive
  by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims
  to represent the 'true past').The study of history has sometimes been classified
  as part of the humanities and at other times as part of the social sciences.[19]
  It can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies
  from both. Some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification.[20]
  In the 20th century, French historian Fernand Braudel revolutionized the study of
  history, by using such outside disciplines as economics, anthropology, and geography
  in the study of global history.Traditionally, historians have recorded events of
  the past, either in writing or by passing on an oral tradition, and have attempted
  to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts.
  From the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions,
  and pictures. In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into
  three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved,
  and historians often consult all three.[21] But writing is the marker that separates
  history from what comes before.Archaeology is a discipline that is especially helpful
  in dealing with buried sites and objects, which, once unearthed, contribute to the
  study of history. But archaeology rarely stands alone. It uses narrative sources
  to complement its discoveries. However, archaeology is constituted by a range of
  methodologies and approaches which are independent from history; that is to say,
  archaeology does not \"fill the gaps\" within textual sources. Indeed, \"historical
  archaeology\" is a specific branch of archaeology, often contrasting its conclusions
  against those of contemporary textual sources. For example, Mark Leone, the excavator
  and interpreter of historical Annapolis, Maryland, USA; has sought to understand
  the contradiction between textual documents and the material record, demonstrating
  the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of
  the total historical environment, despite the ideology of \"liberty\" inherent in
  written documents at this time.There are varieties of ways in which history can
  be organized, including chronologically, culturally, territorially, and thematically.
  These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant overlaps are often present,
  as in \"The International Women's Movement in an Age of Transition, 1830–1975.\"
  It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific
  and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization.
  The area called Big History resists this specialization, and searches for universal
  patterns or trends. History has often been studied with some practical or theoretical
  aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.[22]The history
  of the world is the memory of the past experience of Homo sapiens sapiens around
  the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely in written records. By
  \"prehistory\", historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area
  where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood.
  By studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information
  can be recovered even in the absence of a written record. Since the 20th century,
  the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion
  of certain civilizations, such as those of Sub-Saharan Africa and pre-Columbian
  America. Historians in the West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately
  on the Western world.[23] In 1961, British historian E. H. Carr wrote:The line of
  demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease
  to live only in the present, and become consciously interested both in their past
  and in their future. History begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition
  means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future. Records
  of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.[24]This definition
  includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as Australian
  Aboriginals and New Zealand Māori in the past, and the oral records maintained and
  transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with European civilization.Historiography
  has a number of related meanings. Firstly, it can refer to how history has been
  produced: the story of the development of methodology and practices (for example,
  the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis).
  Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical
  writing (for example, \"medieval historiography during the 1960s\" means \"Works
  of medieval history written during the 1960s\"). Thirdly, it may refer to why history
  is produced: the Philosophy of history. As a meta-level analysis of descriptions
  of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis
  usually focuses on the narratives, interpretations, worldview, use of evidence,
  or method of presentation of other historians. Professional historians also debate
  the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or
  a series of competing narratives.[25][26]Philosophy of history is a branch of philosophy
  concerning the eventual significance, if any, of human history. Furthermore, it
  speculates as to a possible teleological end to its development—that is, it asks
  if there is a design, purpose, directive principle, or finality in the processes
  of human history. Philosophy of history should not be confused with historiography,
  which is the study of history as an academic discipline, and thus concerns its methods
  and practices, and its development as a discipline over time. Nor should philosophy
  of history be confused with the history of philosophy, which is the study of the
  development of philosophical ideas through time.The following questions are used
  by historians in modern work.The first four are known as higher criticism; the fifth,
  lower criticism; and, together, external criticism. The sixth and final inquiry
  about a source is called internal criticism.The historical method comprises the
  techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence
  to research and then to write history.Herodotus of Halicarnassus (484 BC – ca.425
  BC)[27] has generally been acclaimed as the \"father of history\". However, his
  contemporary Thucydides (ca. 460 BC – ca. 400 BC) is credited with having first
  approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the History
  of the Peloponnesian War. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being
  the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and
  effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention.[27] In his historical
  method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, a neutral point of view, and that the
  human world was the result of the actions of human beings. Greek historians also
  viewed history as cyclical, with events regularly recurring.[28]There were historical
  traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval China.
  The groundwork for professional historiography in East Asia was established by the
  Han Dynasty court historian known as Sima Qian (145–90 BC), author of the Shiji
  (Records of the Grand Historian). For the quality of his written work, Sima Qian
  is posthumously known as the Father of Chinese Historiography. Chinese historians
  of subsequent dynastic periods in China used his Shiji as the official format for
  historical texts, as well as for biographical literature.[citation needed]Saint
  Augustine was influential in Christian and Western thought at the beginning of the
  medieval period. Through the Medieval and Renaissance periods, history was often
  studied through a sacred or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher
  and historian Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel brought philosophy and a more secular
  approach in historical study.[22]In the preface to his book, the Muqaddimah (1377),
  the Arab historian and early sociologist, Ibn Khaldun, warned of seven mistakes
  that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached
  the past as strange and in need of interpretation. The originality of Ibn Khaldun
  was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation
  of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which
  it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for
  experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of
  the past. Ibn Khaldun often criticized \"idle superstition and uncritical acceptance
  of historical data.\" As a result, he introduced a scientific method to the study
  of history, and he often referred to it as his \"new science\".[29] His historical
  method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state, communication,
  propaganda and systematic bias in history,[30] and he is thus considered to be the
  \"father of historiography\"[31][32] or the \"father of the philosophy of history\".[33]In
  the West, historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and
  18th centuries, especially in France and Germany. The 19th-century historian with
  greatest influence on methods was Leopold von Ranke in Germany.In the 20th century,
  academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended
  to glorify the nation or great men, to more objective and complex analyses of social
  and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century
  was a tendency to treat history more as a social science rather than as an art,
  which traditionally had been the case. Some of the leading advocates of history
  as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included Fernand
  Braudel, E. H. Carr, Fritz Fischer, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Hans-Ulrich Wehler,
  Bruce Trigger, Marc Bloch, Karl Dietrich Bracher, Peter Gay, Robert Fogel, Lucien
  Febvre and Lawrence Stone. Many of the advocates of history as a social science
  were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach. Braudel combined history
  with geography, Bracher history with political science, Fogel history with economics,
  Gay history with psychology, Trigger history with archaeology while Wehler, Bloch,
  Fischer, Stone, Febvre and Le Roy Ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated
  history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics. More recently, the
  field of digital history has begun to address ways of using computer technology
  to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.In opposition
  to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as Hugh Trevor-Roper,
  John Lukacs, Donald Creighton, Gertrude Himmelfarb and Gerhard Ritter argued that
  the key to the historians' work was the power of the imagination, and hence contended
  that history should be understood as an art. French historians associated with the
  Annales School introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives
  of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of cultural history
  (cf. histoire des mentalités). Intellectual historians such as Herbert Butterfield,
  Ernst Nolte and George Mosse have argued for the significance of ideas in history.
  American historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked
  ethnic, racial, and socio-economic groups. Another genre of social history to emerge
  in the post-WWII era was Alltagsgeschichte (History of Everyday Life). Scholars
  such as Martin Broszat, Ian Kershaw and Detlev Peukert sought to examine what everyday
  life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century Germany, especially in the Nazi
  period.Marxist historians such as Eric Hobsbawm, E. P. Thompson, Rodney Hilton,
  Georges Lefebvre, Eugene D. Genovese, Isaac Deutscher, C. L. R. James, Timothy Mason,
  Herbert Aptheker, Arno J. Mayer and Christopher Hill have sought to validate Karl
  Marx's theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to
  the Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as François Furet, Richard
  Pipes, J. C. D. Clark, Roland Mousnier, Henry Ashby Turner and Robert Conquest have
  offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history. Feminist historians such as Joan
  Wallach Scott, Claudia Koonz, Natalie Zemon Davis, Sheila Rowbotham, Gisela Bock,
  Gerda Lerner, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, and Lynn Hunt have argued for the importance
  of studying the experience of women in the past. In recent years, postmodernists
  have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that
  all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. In his 1997 book
  In Defence of History, Richard J. Evans, a professor of modern history at Cambridge
  University, defended the worth of history. Another defence of history from post-modernist
  criticism was the Australian historian Keith Windschuttle's 1994 book, The Killing
  of History.The Marxist theory of historical materialism theorises that society is
  fundamentally determined by the material conditions at any given time – in other
  words, the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfil basic
  needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families.[34] Overall,
  Marx and Engels claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development
  of these material conditions in Western Europe.[35] Marxist historiography was once
  orthodoxy in the Soviet Union, but since the collapse of communism there in 1991,
  Mikhail Krom says it has been reduced to the margins of scholarship.[36]Marx observed
  that each stage or epoch created a new class or invention that would lead to its
  downfall. However the downfall would not be an automatically negative event, since
  with each step humanity at large would benefit. Each passing stage would therefore
  raise the standard of living of the masses while at the same time be doomed to its
  own downfall because of internal contradictions and class conflicts.The first three
  stages are not given particular attention, since by Marx's time they had long come
  to pass. As such, he does not provide the principles of these stages as he does
  for capitalism and the stages that follow. Nonetheless, these epochs have common
  characteristics.These are approaches to history; not listed are histories of other
  fields, such as history of science, history of mathematics and history of philosophy.Historical
  study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of
  time. Historians give these periods of time names in order to allow \"organising
  ideas and classificatory generalisations\" to be used by historians.[37] The names
  given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the start
  and end of a particular period. Centuries and decades are commonly used periods
  and the time they represent depends on the dating system used. Most periods are
  constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past.
  The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they
  are viewed and studied.[38]The field of history generally leaves prehistory to the
  archaeologists, who have entirely different sets of tools and theories. The usual
  method for periodisation of the distant prehistoric past, in archeology is to rely
  on changes in material culture and technology, such as the Stone Age, Bronze Age
  and Iron Age and their sub-divisions also based on different styles of material
  remains. Despite the development over recent decades of the ability through radiocarbon
  dating and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts,
  these long-established schemes seem likely to remain in use. In many cases neighbouring
  cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it, which may be
  used.The Marxian theory of history identifies five stages of history:[39][40][41][42][43]The
  First Stage: is usually called primitive communism. It has the following characteristics.The
  Second Stage: may be called slave society, considered to be the beginning of \"class
  society\" where private property appears.The Third Stage: may be called feudalism;
  it appears after slave society collapses. This was most obvious during the European
  Middle Ages when society went from slavery to feudalism.Marx pays special attention
  to this stage in human development. The bulk of his work is devoted to analysing
  the mechanisms of capitalism, which in western society classically arose \"red in
  tooth and claw\" from feudal society in a revolutionary movement. In capitalism,
  the profit motive rules and people, freed from serfdom, work for the capitalists
  for wages. The capitalist class are free to spread their laissez faire practices
  around the world. In the capitalist-controlled parliament, laws are made to protect
  wealth.Capitalism may be considered the Fourth Stage in the sequence. It appears
  after the bourgeois revolution when the capitalists (or their merchant predecessors)
  overthrow the feudal system. Capitalism is categorized by the following:But according
  to Marx, capitalism, like slave society and feudalism, also has critical failings
  — inner contradictions which will lead to its downfall. The working class, to which
  the capitalist class gave birth in order to produce commodities and profits, is
  the \"grave digger\" of capitalism. The worker is not paid the full value of what
  he or she produces. The rest is surplus value — the capitalist's profit, which Marx
  calls the \"unpaid labour of the working class.\" The capitalists are forced by
  competition to attempt to drive down the wages of the working class to increase
  their profits, and this creates conflict between the classes, and gives rise to
  the development of class consciousness in the working class. The working class,
  through trade union and other struggles, becomes conscious of itself as an exploited
  class. In the view of classical Marxism, the struggles of the working class against
  the attacks of the capitalist class will eventually lead the working class to establish
  its own collective control over productionAfter the working class gains class consciousness
  and mounts a revolution against the capitalists, socialism, which may be considered
  the Fifth Stage, will be attained, if the workers are successful.Socialism may be
  characterised as follows:Marx explained that, since socialism, the first stage of
  communism, would be \"in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually,
  still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges\",
  each worker would naturally expect to be awarded according to the amount of labor
  he contributes, despite the fact that each worker's ability and family circumstances
  would differ, so that the results would still be unequal at this stage, although
  fully supported by social provision.Particular geographical locations can form the
  basis of historical study, for example, continents, countries and cities. Understanding
  why historic events took place is important. To do this, historians often turn to
  geography. Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all
  affect the lives of the people who live there. For example, to explain why the ancient
  Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the geography of Egypt is
  essential. Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which
  flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks. The rich soil could help farmers
  grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities. That meant everyone did not
  have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization.Military
  history concerns warfare, strategies, battles, weapons, and the psychology of combat.
  The \"new military history\" since the 1970s has been concerned with soldiers more
  than generals, with psychology more than tactics, and with the broader impact of
  warfare on society and culture.[44]The history of religion has been a main theme
  for both secular and religious historians for centuries, and continues to be taught
  in seminaries and academe. Leading journals include Church History, Catholic Historical
  Review, and History of Religions. Topics range widely from political and cultural
  and artistic dimensions, to theology and liturgy.[45] This subject studies religions
  from all regions and areas of the world where humans have lived.[46]Social history,
  sometimes called the new social history, is the field that includes history of ordinary
  people and their strategies and institutions for coping with life.[47] In its \"golden
  age\" it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still
  is well represented in history departments. In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the
  proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social
  history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell
  from 40% to 30%.[48] In the history departments of British universities in 2007,
  of the 5723 faculty members, 1644 (29%) identified themselves with social history
  while political history came next with 1425 (25%).[49] The \"old\" social history
  before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often
  included political movements, like Populism, that were \"social\" in the sense of
  being outside the elite system. Social history was contrasted with political history,
  intellectual history and the history of great men. English historian G. M. Trevelyan
  saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting
  that, \"Without social history, economic history is barren and political history
  unintelligible.\"[50] While the field has often been viewed negatively as history
  with the politics left out, it has also been defended as \"history with the people
  put back in.\"[51]The chief subfields of social history include:Cultural history
  replaced social history as the dominant form in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically
  combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular
  cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines
  the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a
  group of people. How peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic.
  Cultural history includes the study of art in society as well is the study of images
  and human visual production (iconography).[52]Diplomatic history focuses on the
  relationships between nations, primarily regarding diplomacy and the causes of wars.
  More recently it looks at the causes of peace and human rights. It typically presents
  the viewpoints of the foreign office, and long-term strategic values, as the driving
  force of continuity and change in history. This type of political history is the
  study of the conduct of international relations between states or across state boundaries
  over time. Historian Muriel Chamberlain notes that after the First World War:She
  adds that after 1945, the trend reversed, allowing social history to replace it.Although
  economic history has been well established since the late 19th century, in recent
  years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and
  away from traditional history departments.[54]Business history deals with the history
  of individual business organizations, business methods, government regulation, labor
  relations, and impact on society. It also includes biographies of individual companies,
  executives, and entrepreneurs. It is related to economic history; Business history
  is most often taught in business schools.[55]Environmental history is a new field
  that emerged in the 1980s to look at the history of the environment, especially
  in the long run, and the impact of human activities upon it.[56]World history is
  the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. World history is
  primarily a teaching field, rather than a research field. It gained popularity in
  the United States,[57] Japan[58] and other countries after the 1980s with the realization
  that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds.It
  has led to highly controversial interpretations by Oswald Spengler and Arnold J.
  Toynbee, among others.The World History Association publishes the Journal of World
  History every quarter since 1990.[59] The H-World discussion list[60] serves as
  a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions
  among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews.A people's
  history is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events
  from the perspective of common people. A people's history is the history of the
  world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders. Individuals or groups
  not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary
  focus, which includes the disenfranchised, the oppressed, the poor, the nonconformists,
  and the otherwise forgotten people. This history also usually focuses on events
  occurring in the fullness of time, or when an overwhelming wave of smaller events
  cause certain developments to occur.Intellectual history and the history of ideas
  emerged in the mid-20th century, with the focus on the intellectuals and their books
  on the one hand, and on the other the study of ideas as disembodied objects with
  a career of their own.[61][62]Gender history is a sub-field of History and Gender
  studies, which looks at the past from the perspective of gender. It is in many ways,
  an outgrowth of women's history. Despite its relatively short life, Gender History
  (and its forerunner Women's History) has had a rather significant effect on the
  general study of history. Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first
  achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases,
  each with its own challenges and outcomes. Although some of the changes to the study
  of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous
  women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession,
  other influences are more subtle.Public history describes the broad range of activities
  undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally
  working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice has quite
  deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history,
  museum curatorship, and other related fields. The term itself began to be used in
  the U.S. and Canada in the late 1970s, and the field has become increasingly professionalized
  since that time. Some of the most common settings for public history are museums,
  historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television
  companies, and all levels of government.[63]Professional and amateur historians
  discover, collect, organize, and present information about past events. In lists
  of historians, historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which
  they were writing, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they
  specialized. Chroniclers and annalists, though they are not historians in the true
  sense, are also frequently included.Since the 20th century, Western historians have
  disavowed the aspiration to provide the \"judgement of history.\"[64] The goals
  of historical judgements or interpretations are separate to those of legal judgements,
  that need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final.[65] A related
  issue to that of the judgement of history is that of collective memory.Pseudohistory
  is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart
  from standard historiographical conventions in a way which undermines their conclusions.
  Closely related to deceptive historical revisionism, works which draw controversial
  conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, particularly
  in the fields of national, political, military, and religious affairs, are often
  rejected as pseudohistory.A major intellectual battle took place in Britain in the
  early twentieth century regarding the place of history teaching in the universities.
  At Oxford and Cambridge, scholarship was downplayed. Professor Charles Harding Firth,
  Oxford's Regius Professor of history in 1904 ridiculed the system as best suited
  to produce superficial journalists. The Oxford tutors, who had more votes than the
  professors, fought back in defense of their system saying that it successfully produced
  Britain's outstanding statesmen, administrators, prelates, and diplomats, and that
  mission was as valuable as training scholars. The tutors dominated the debate until
  after the Second World War. It forced aspiring young scholars to teach at outlying
  schools, such as Manchester University, where T.F. Tout was professionalising the
  History undergraduate programme at by introducing the study of original sources
  and requiring the writing of a thesis.[66][67]In the United States, scholarship
  was concentrated at the major PhD-producing universities, while the large number
  of other colleges and universities focused on undergraduate teaching. A tendency
  in the 21st century was for the latter schools to increasingly demand scholarly
  productivity of their younger tenure-track faculty. Furthermore, universities have
  increasingly relied on inexpensive part-time adjuncts to do most of the classroom
  teaching.[68]From the origins of national school systems in the 19th century, the
  teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority. In the
  United States after World War I, a strong movement emerged at the university level
  to teach courses in Western Civilization, so as to give students a common heritage
  with Europe. In the U.S. after 1980 attention increasingly moved toward teaching
  world history or requiring students to take courses in non-western cultures, to
  prepare students for life in a globalized economy.[69]At the university level, historians
  debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the
  humanities. Many view the field from both perspectives.The teaching of history in
  French schools was influenced by the Nouvelle histoire as disseminated after the
  1960s by Cahiers pédagogiques and Enseignement and other journals for teachers.
  Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique,
  (INRDP). Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils children
  should learn about historians' approaches as well as facts and dates. Louis François,
  Dean of the History/Geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education advised
  that teachers should provide historic documents and promote \"active methods\" which
  would give pupils \"the immense happiness of discovery.\" Proponents said it was
  a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching
  and left the students bored. Traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern
  innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and
  national identity.[70]In most countries history textbook are tools to foster nationalism
  and patriotism, and give students the official line about national enemies.[71]In
  many countries history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are
  written to put the national heritage in the most favorable light. For example, in
  Japan, mention of the Nanking Massacre has been removed from textbooks and the entire
  Second World War is given cursory treatment. Other countries have complained.[72]
  It was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid Marxist historiography.[73][74]Academic
  historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes
  with success.[75][76]In 21st-century Germany, the history curriculum is controlled
  by the 16 states, and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an \"almost
  pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone\" and reflects \"principles formulated
  by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, thus oriented
  towards human rights, democracy and peace.\" The result is that \"German textbooks
  usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding
  of citizenship centred on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and
  Europeanness.\"[77]"
