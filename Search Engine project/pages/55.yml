- |
  1. Clarificatory The hope that these notes would have some claim to serve as a
- |
  document of record has limited the character of the anecdotal material
- |
  that could be included; roughly, it could not be gratuitously hurtful
- "and it had to have some point. \n"
- |2
   The following abbreviations are used in the less formal parts
- |
  of the text: Lab for Statistical Laboratory, UL for University
- |
  Lecturer, UAL for University Assistant Lecturer, OR for Operational
- |
  Research, DPMMS for the Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical
- |
  Statistics and DAMTP for the Department of Applied Mathematics and
- "Theoretical Physics. \n"

   Some of the long-serving members of the computing staff
- |
  figure in the article. The members of the secretarial staff have been
- |
  many and various; rough justice is perhaps best achieved by naming the
- |
  first and the last, both of whom have some special character. Beata
- |
  Reifenberg was the Lab Secretary in the St Andrew's Hill days. Wally
- |
  Smith says of her: ``I have seldom encountered an equal in all the days
- |
  since then. Her great ambition was to be able to afford to buy all the
- |
  Brandenburg concertos on long-play records''. Sarah Shea-Simonds has
- |
  been Secretary since 1985; it is Sarah who stirred the Laboratory into
- |
  the actions, long contemplated but not hitherto undertaken, of
- "celebrating this anniversary and writing this history. \n"
- |2
   This 2001 revision of the text corrects some minor errors and
- |
  adds material which came in too late to be incorporated in the 1993
- |
  version; notably from Frank Anscombe, Norman Bailey, Colin Campbell,
- |
  Anthony Edwards, Charles Goldie, David McLaren and Ingram Olkin. These
- |
  additions still concern only the period up to 1993 (to the point of an
- |
  apparent obliviousness of staff changes made soon after); events after
- |
  that are left to some other chronicler.

   2.
- |
  Prehistory
- |2
   There had been considerable activity in statistics in
- |
  Cambridge well before 1947, distinguished initially by some striking
- |
  individual figures and then by a quickening recognition of the subject
- |
  as a field in its own right. In coverage of the earliest phases we draw
- "largely (and briefly) on Edwards (1991). \n"
- |2
   Edwards regards statistics as beginning in Cambridge with
- |
  Augustus de Morgan (matriculated 1923), followed in that century by
- |
  R.L. Ellis (1836), J. Venn (1853), J.W.L. Glaisher (1867), all prime
- |
  names in any history of statistics or probability. F.J.M. Stratton
- |
  (1901) lectured on the Combination of Observations; Edwards' mention
- |
  that Fisher attended his lectures in 1911 gives a link with living
- "memory. \n"
- |2
   In 1912 a University Lectureship in Statistics was
- |
  established to which G. Udny Yule was appointed, working in the Faculty
- |
  of Agriculture. Yule was already the author of a very influential
- |
  textbook ( An Introduction to the Theory of Statistics,
- |
  Griffin, 1911), but is now remembered for his subsequent work in time
- |
  series analysis. He opened a new era in this subject by his proposal of
- |
  the autoregressive process. Yule retired in 1931, by then a Reader, but
- |
  remained an active figure. Maurice Bartlett mentions of his
- |
  postgraduate year (1932/3) that Yule ``was very much one of my mentors,
- |
  as he no doubt was of Maurice Kendall, who was a Cambridge student before
- "the Wishart era'' \n"
- |2
   While the Statistical Laboratory has been the product of many
- |
  influences, it is in the School of Agriculture that one rightly sees
- |
  its genesis. Statistics has been fostered there as a tool and as a
- |
  discipline from the days of Professor T.B. Wood, Udny Yule was a
- |
  seminal and international figure and it was the interaction of the
- |
  School and the Faculty of Mathematics (through the mediation of John
- |
  Wishart, as we shall see) which produced both the Statistical
- |
  Laboratory and the Diploma. The School has continued its own vital
- |
  interest in the subject with the A.R.C. Statistics Group. The history
- |
  of these developments has been set out very thoroughly by Colin
- "Campbell (1959). \n"
- |2
   Harold Jeffreys came squarely on to the Cambridge academic
- |
  scene when he was appointed a College Lecturer (St. John's) in 1922,
- |
  this being converted to a University Lectureship in 1926. Jeffreys'
- |
  primary interest, which was geophysics, stimulated him to a strong
- |
  derived interest in inference. His books Scientific Inference
- |
  (Cambridge University Press, 1931; third edition 1975) and Theory
- |
  of Probability (Clarendon Press, 1939; third edition 1961)
- |
  established his reputation in that field, then and now. Jeffreys'
- |
  approach to inference (and by `probability' he often means statistical
- |
  inference; by `inverse probability' he always does) was explicitly
- |
  Bayesian, with maximum entropy criteria also clearly formulated, and so
- "still finds considerable resonance. \n"
- |2
   Yule was succeeded on retirement in 1931 by John Wishart,
- |
  arriving from Rothamsted. Wishart's Readership was primarily assigned
- |
  to the Faculty of Agriculture, but the terms of his post directed him
- |
  to give courses for mathematicians as well as for postgraduate students
- |
  in agriculture. Bartlett writes: ``as there was space allotted to
- |
  Wishart in the School of Agriculture, where practical classes in
- |
  statistics were given, my own inclination is always to think of a
- |
  `Statistical Laboratory' being in existence from Wishart's arrival in
- "Cambridge''. \n"
- |2
   Some idea of the activity at this time may be gained from
- |
  Edwards' observation that a student taking Part III of the Mathematical
- |
  Tripos in 1935/6 ``could hear Sir Arthur Eddington's `Combination of
- |
  Observations' in the Michaelmas Term, John Wishart's `Theory of
- |
  Statistics' in the Lent Term and Harold Jeffreys' `Probability' in the
- |
  Easter Term''. Indeed, in 1931/2 Maurice Bartlett took just these
- |
  courses, with the substitution of Fowler's `Statistical Mechanics' for
- "Jeffreys' course. \n"
- |2
   In these days of student appraisal of lecturers etc. it is
- |
  interesting to note how common it seemed to be then that even
- |
  interesting material or brilliant intellects were accompanied by
- |
  indifferent delivery. Some of us can take heart! Henry Daniels says of
- |
  Wishart that ``although the lectures themselves were not very well
- |
  given, the material was very interesting'' and of Eddington
- |
  ``intriguing, and a little bizarre in some respects''. David Finney
- |
  writes of Jeffreys that his ``personal charm and enthusiasm did not
- |
  prevent a steady decline in attendance''. Norman Bailey recalls
- |
  Jeffreys' lectures as being ``interesting but difficult, not least
- |
  because from time to time Jeffreys would become inarticulate, simply
- |
  waving his arms while his brain moved on. When he rearticulated some
- |
  minutes later in a perfectly lucid way it was apparent that we
- |
  had just missed what he had thought but had been unable to say in those
- "precious minutes''. \n"
- |2
   One might also note the number of people, later to become
- |
  prominent statisticians, who passed through Cambridge before
- |
  the foundation of the Statistical Laboratory: e.g. Yates, Bartlett,
- |
  Finney, Maurice Kendall, Daniels, Cochran, Barnard, Cedric Smith and
- "Armitage. \n"
- |2
   Wishart was all the time endeavouring to promote the subject
- |
  of statistics, and in fact to develop a programme in mathematical
- |
  statistics. In this he was not positively helped by the presence in
- |
  Cambridge of the two luminaries of the subject: Jeffreys and Fisher
- |
  (who had been appointed Professor of Genetics in 1943). These two were
- |
  of course accorded the respect of the Faculty of Mathematics, which
- |
  Wishart (based in Agriculture) was not, and Wishart had the ambition of
- |
  creating a working unit in statistics, which they did not. A lofty word
- "from either of them could have a withering effect. \n"
- |2
   However, the Faculty of Mathematics evidently felt the need
- |
  for some in-house strength in statistics, and in June 1938 advertised a
- |
  University Lecturership for which special consideration was to be given
- |
  ``to candidates with qualifications in the Theory of Statistics''.
- |
  Maurice Bartlett was appointed. With a break for war-work he held the
- |
  post until 1947. He lectured first largely in statistical theory, a
- |
  subject which was still evolving to the shape we would recognise today.
- |
  Bartlett combined ideas which were in general circulation with his own
- |
  statistical research (never recognised at its full pioneering worth).
- |
  Frank Anscombe took notes of this course which Henry Daniels later
- |
  read, to realise that ``Bartlett's approach to the subject was one that
- |
  I sympathised with very much''. Violet Cane attended Maurice's
- |
  statistics course in 1939/40; she recalls finding it difficult at the
- |
  time, but realised later that she had (and still has!) a beautiful set
- |
  of notes. Development of ideas was then the consideration, rather than
- |
  rigour, so, when Dennis Lindley asked Bartlett to prove consistency of
- |
  the maximum likelihood estimate in class in 1946, this was a little
- |
  cruel, as he himself admits. It was to be yet a while before a good
- "proof was found by Wald (and, actually, by Lindley also). \n"
- |2
   Maurice Bartlett is of course specially noted for his early
- |
  and fundamental contributions to the theory of stochastic processes,
- |
  but it is first after his return from war work that he seems to have
- |
  given a course on the subject , whose reach had still not been defined
- |
  by a text. Bartlett's own text was one of the very first. The course
- |
  included stationary time series and diffusion processes as special
- |
  topics. Norman Bailey attended it in 1946/7. He had trouble with time
- |
  series component, ``but the evolutionary process component was nothing
- |
  short of inspiring and had considerable importance for a lot of my
- |
  later applied research". Wishart was also absent on national service
- |
  during the war years, when
- |
  his lectures were given by Dr J.O Irwin. Also, for at least one of
- |
  those years, mathematics undergraduates were required to come up during
- |
  the summer vacation to study electronics. Norman Bailey recalls
- |
  enjoying the electronics much more than the statistics. Jeffreys also
- |
  later gave a short course in statistics, reputedly to Wishart's
- |
  annoyance.

- |2
   Maurice Bartlett has kept copies of a three-way
- |
  correspondence in 1943 between himself, Wishart and F.P. White, then
- |
  Secretary of the Faculty Board of Mathematics. The former two were both
- |
  away on national service; Bartlett writes from the Projectile
- |
  Development Establishment in Aberporth and Wishart from the Civil
- |
  Establishments Branch, Admiralty, Whitehall. White had written to all
- |
  teachers of Mathematics in the University, including those on national
- |
  service, asking for their views on the pattern to be envisaged for the
- |
  Faculty and its activities after the war. The Faculty still had no
- |
  collective physical accommodation, and had reported immediately before
- |
  the war that its most urgent need was ``the foundation of an Institute
- |
  of Mathematics in close proximity to the Mathematical Laboratory and
- "the Philosophical Library''. \n"
- |2
   Wishart was of course concerned with the position of
- |
  Statistics; he plainly wished to escape from Agriculture, whose
- |
  interest in Statistics he considered too narrow, and very much wished
- |
  to be associated with the projected Institute. On the other hand, he
- |
  considered that Statistics should occupy a central position relative to
- |
  a number of Faculties, and sketched a case for the establishment of a
- |
  separate Faculty of Statistics. He nevertheless obviously regarded the
- |
  Faculty of Mathematics as the best single peg on which to cling
- |
  immediately: ``Returning to the question of the Institute, an `embryo'
- |
  school of Statistics should certainly be housed therein''. He wished
- |
  such a school to be open to members of any Faculty, but that its
- "fundamental basis should be mathematical. \n"
- |2
   Bartlett, already a member of the Faculty of Mathematics, was
- |
  more concerned with the provision of advanced courses. This meant Part
- |
  III courses; the Diploma was not yet envisaged. He was particularly
- |
  concerned to gain coverage for statistical (in fact, probabilistic)
- |
  thinking in physical contexts, and for a new course on the `theory of
- |
  stochastic processes', a topic then more familiar to some under the
- "names of `random functions' or `time series'. \n"
- |2
   The demand for trained statisticians revealed during the war
- |
  was such that in 1946 a second University Lectureship was advertised,
- |
  to which Henry Daniels was appointed. Wishart could now see his
- |
  long-nursed ambition of a Diploma in Statistics approaching
- |
  realisation. There were discussions about the content of the proposed
- |
  Diploma. Maurice Bartlett recalls a degree of irritation when, during
- |
  his convalescence after an appendectomy in 1946, he was ``visited by
- |
  Wishart in the nursing-home to discuss the final draft Diploma
- |
  regulations. These included the requirement to take a `field of
- |
  application', which was facilitated by the link with agriculture and
- |
  with genetics, following the appointment of Fisher during the war to
- |
  the genetics chair''. Bartlett himself missed out on the actual
- |
  foundation; in 1947 he left to become the first Professor of
- |
  Mathematical Statistics at Manchester. He was replaced in Cambridge
- |
  late that year by Frank Anscombe, from Rothamsted, who took up the post
- |
  in January, 1948.
- |
  3.
- |
  1947--55 Creation and
- |
  confirmation
- |2
   In 1947 the Faculty of Mathematics submitted a report to the
- |
  General Board proposing the establishment of a Diploma in Statistics
- |
  and a Statistical Laboratory, the former to be awarded to
- |
  mathematicians who had attended a course and been examined in
- |
  theoretical and applied statistics, and the latter ``to provide
- |
  primarily for the applied work in Statistics for students of this and
- |
  possibly of other Faculties, including Diploma and Research Students''.
- |2+

- |2
   This was considered by the General Board in a Report dated
- |
  14th May 1947 ( Reporter , 1946-47, p. 1058),
- |
  which indeed recommended the institution of a Diploma in Mathematical
- |
  Statistics. The qualification `Mathematical' had been inserted to quell
- |
  the concerns of some other Faculty Boards that the statement in the
- |
  Diploma document that the candidate had displayed a special knowledge
- |
  of Statistics and of its application in a certain field might be taken
- |
  to imply that he was an expert in that field. Wishart's lifelong
- |
  enthusiasm for the teaching of statistics was now
- |
  being rewarded, and his dreams of a properly-established unit being
- |
  fulfilled. At a Royal Statistical Society discussion meeting on the
- |
  Teaching of Statistics which he opened he was able to report with pride
- |
  that ``it is now possible for a mathematical graduate at the University
- |
  of Cambridge to take a one-year Diploma in Statistics, during which
- |
  time he will be attached to a department where practical work is done,
- |
  and will be examined finally on his work in the chosen field of
- |
  application'' ( J. Roy. Statist. Soc. A
- |
  (1948) 111 , p. 227). This relates to an
- |
  interesting theme which emerges repeatedly in the discussion: the need
- |
  revealed during the war for statisticians with both practical and
- |
  mathematical competence.
- |2+

- |2
   Fisher commented on these developments with his usual blend
- |
  of soundness and tetchiness; Edwards quotes passages from his
- |
  daughter's biography of him (Box, 1978). Fisher's own words at the end
- |
  are from a letter to Wishart in which he agrees to serve on a small
- "advisory Committee for the Diploma. \n"
- |
  ``After the diploma in mathematical statistics at Cambridge
- |
  was offered, to be awarded in recognition of one year's work in
- |
  statistics for graduates in mathematics, Fisher expressed the opinion
- |
  1949 that the regulations would only work well for those students who
- |
  had already taken mathematical statistics to Part III [of the
- |
  Mathematical Tripos] and who gave their year's work principally to
- |
  understanding an applied field. It seemed to him
- |
  the attempt by means of a single-year course organised by the faculty
- |
  of mathematics must necessarily fail to supply the real demand for
- |
  statistical training:
- |
  ` There is no wide or urgent demand for people
- |
  who will define methods of proof in set theory in the name of improving
- |
  mathematical statistics. There is a widespread and urgent demand for
- |
  mathematicians who understand that branch of mathematics known as
- |
  mathematical statistics but who are capable also of recognising
- |
  situations in the real world to which such mathematics is applicable.'
- "'' \n"
- |2
   In 1950 the University did indeed amend the regulations for
- |
  the Diploma so that candidates without adequate mathematical
- |
  preparation could be required to take two years over the course.
- |
  Developments in the world of statistics over following years doubtless
- |
  reinforced Fisher in his apprehensions. However, the Cambridge Diploma
- |
  has remained true to its initial conception: that the theoretical
- |
  grounding should be accompanied by close acquaintance with an applied
- "field and a testing investigation of data from that field. \n"
- |2
   The General Board report quoted above passed over the
- |
  question of the foundation of the Statistical Laboratory as an
- |
  institution, but nevertheless discussed the provision of accommodation
- |
  for the Laboratory. Whether this was deliberate is unclear. The
- |
  Buildings Syndicate had already indicated its conditional preparedness
- |
  to ``recommend the assignment of a vacant site in Corn Exchange Street
- |
  for a temporary hut'' ( Reporter , 1946--47, p.
- |
  1296). So, the Statistical Laboratory existed to the considerable
- |
  extent that it was to have its own building, erected to its own
- |
  specifications submitted through the Faculty Board of Mathematics. More
- |
  than that, eloquent and conclusive, the structure when completed
- |
  carried a sign: `Statistical Laboratory'. The building was indeed a
- |
  `hut': brick, single-storey, 70 feet by 24, with six working rooms, one
- |
  of these being a larger `students' room' which served also for
- |
  seminars. It faced on to St Andrew's Hill, a lane off Corn Exchange
- "Street which has since been obliterated by the Lion Yard car park. \n"
- |2
   Dennis Lindley's recollection of the plan of the building and
- |
  its eventual occupancy is sketched below. Dennis's impression is that
- |
  David Cox used whatever room happened to be spare, although this
- |
  presumably did not continue. He mentions also that Wishart's original
- |
  plans made no allowances for lavatories. We see them here beside the
- "boiler, of which more anon. \n"
- " \n"
- |2
   For the session 1947/8 accommodation had perforce to be found
- |
  in the School of Agriculture, classes being held there and in the Arts
- |
  School. Frank Anscombe recalls Henry Daniels demonstrating his Bicycle
- |
  Theory (a counterintuitive steering theory) outside the School of
- |
  Agriculture building, so remembered with affection. However, in 1948
- |
  the staff (namely: Wishart, Daniels and Anscombe, with two computing
- |
  assistants: Donald East and Ena Laurie) moved to St Andrew's Hill.
- |
  Wishart seems to have shifted from his quarters of 16 years in the
- |
  School of Agriculture without hesitation. Bartlett comments: ``Wishart
- |
  was always keen to `push' statistics, and I don't know whether this
- |
  contributed to his falling-out in due course with Engledow, then
- |
  Director of the School of Agriculture, and that in turn to the creation
- |
  of the Laboratory''. However, that the School of Agriculture had indeed
- |
  been helpful is indicated by an acknowledgement in the report from the
- |
  Faculty Board of Mathematics: ``In the past, a number of graduates in
- |
  Mathematics were encouraged to spend a fourth year in research and in
- |
  equipping themselves as practising statisticians; the Board have been
- |
  indebted to the Department of Agriculture for equipping a small
- |
  laboratory which provided the necessary facilities''. Such an origin
- |
  certainly made it natural to carry over the title `statistical
- |
  laboratory' which, while accepted at University College London as given
- "by Galton, sat rather less naturally in a Faculty of Mathematics. \n"
- |2
   In any case, John Wishart's `pushing' was to good effect.
- |
  Dennis Lindley was appointed in 1948 to a Demonstratorship and David
- |
  Cox in 1950 to an Assistant Lectureship. David Cox was well known to
- |
  Henry Daniels; the two had worked together at the Wool Industries
- |
  Research Association -- one of those pragmatic institutions whose mark
- |
  its sometime members happily bear for life (see Daniels and Whittle,
- "1993). \n"
- |2
   Ingram Olkin mentions, interestingly, that many of the
- |
  significant departments of statistics in the USA were founded about
- |
  this time: Columbia and North Carolina in 1946, Stanford in 1948,
- |
  Berkeley and Chicago around 1952 and Iowa State somewhat earlier.
- |
  Wishart set the content and tone of the teaching for the first term of
- |
  the Diploma; Violet Cane recalls feeling distinctly depressed and ready
- |
  to quit. However, matters changed greatly for the better after
- |
  Christmas, when Henry Daniels took over courses, and even more so after
- |
  Easter (1948), when Frank Anscombe joined. Relief seems to have been
- |
  general; Norman Bailey writes that ``the General Mathematical
- |
  Statistics course was given by Henry Daniels most brilliantly, as
- |
  evinced by the resounding ovation he received at the end''. Norman
- |
  testifies to the meatiness of the course, as does John Nelder (Diploma
- |
  1948/9). Design of Experiments was done thoroughly in those days. Frank
- |
  Anscombe gave the course in John's year; he dragged the class through
- |
  Galois fields in lectures and then asked candidates to design a
- |
  rotation experiment in the practical exam.
- |2+

- |2
   Henry Daniels has preserved his class lists from that time.
- |
  From his Stats II course for 1947/8 we can identify the members of the
- |
  first Diploma year and recognise many of them: N.T.J. Bailey, V.R.
- |
  Cane, J. Durbin, G.S. James, S.F. James, F.H.C. Marriott, P. Robinson,
- |
  D.C. Shaw, N.J. Wang and L. Whitehouse. There are other familiar names
- |
  on the list; e.g. J.M. Hammersley, J.A. Nelder and E.S. Page from Part
- |
  II of the Tripos, J.E. Drummond and J.C. Tanner from Part III and R.M.
- |
  Williams, a research student. C.R. Rao was also in Cambridge that year;
- "as a research student with Fisher, but attending the Lab seminars. \n"
- |2
   Dennis Lindley recalls some of the early Diploma examinations
- |
  as being so difficult (in an attempt to impress the mathematicians with
- |
  the respectability of the subject) that they stumped staff as well as
- |
  students, laying a supervision minefield for years to come. However,
- |
  Jim Durbin emphasises that, for the 1947/8 Diploma, the real problem,
- |
  at least for him, was ``the seven-hour practical exam
- |
  . We had 10 students in a small room grinding away for dear life on
- |
  Brunsviga manually-driven calculators all day long. The noise was
- |
  horrific and I found it so hard to concentrate I thought I'd probably
- |
  made a hash of it and hence, since Wishart was always going on about
- |
  the practical exam being the most important part of the whole affair,
- |
  had failed the Diploma. Fortunately, forbearance triumphed and I got a
- "Distinction''. \n"
- |2
   Both Henry and Violet speak of the particular vividness and
- |
  exhilaration of the immediate post-war years, as people streamed back
- |
  from war-work to resume their studies. This cohort represented a store
- |
  of banked-up talent; individuals who valued the prospects that peace
- |
  opened and met them with minds at once mature and fresh. One such was
- |
  Robin Williams, who had been working on electromagnetic separation
- |
  processes for the Manhattan Project, and who, despite encouragement to
- |
  stay, chose rather to start research in statistics in Cambridge from
- |
  1947. He was disappointed to find that his prospective supervisor,
- |
  Bartlett, had moved, to be replaced by Wishart. An appeal to Daniels
- |
  resulted in his being passed on to Frank Anscombe for what turned out
- |
  to be a rewarding collaboration (on the optimisation of experimental
- |
  lay-out in the presence of spatial autocorrelation between plots).
- "Robin recalls Anscombe and Daniels with warmth. \n"
- |2
   Other research students from this time were Dennis Evans,
- |
  Andrew Ehrenberg (both 1949/52), Wally Smith (1950/3) and Ewan Page
- |
  (1951/4). Wally very nearly missed the return to graduate work in
- |
  Cambridge. He had just served three years in the Royal Navy and had now
- |
  arranged study, grant and marriage. However, with the advent of the
- |
  Korean War, all releases were cancelled. Wally was appalled at the
- |
  prospect of the collapse of his plans and urgently required a ``letter
- |
  that would convince the admirals that I would be serving the nation
- |
  much better studying Statistics than drowning in the China Sea'' -
- |
  Wally could not swim. He found it difficult to convince anybody in
- |
  Cambridge of the urgency of his case, but at last wrung a missive from
- |
  his supervisor-to-be, Henry Daniels, which, reinforced by support from
- "Dr Stoneley of Pembroke, did the trick. \n"
- |2
   Wally recalls the Stats Lab as he knew it: housed in the St
- |
  Andrew's Hill hut. A cosy place, tiny offices, and a library whose
- |
  excellence he attributes to Lindley. The room containing the gas
- |
  furnace was off limits, with apparent good reason, as ``every week or
- |
  two a considerable explosion would erupt''. The furnace was in the care
- |
  of ``Donald East, who seemed, on first encounter, to be a little
- |
  distant and saturnine, but, on further acquaintance, proved to be
- |
  amiable and helpful, and very competent at his work (except, perhaps,
- |
  for those occasional lapses in the furnace room: once the detonation he
- |
  produced while making `necessary adjustments' caused a bang of many
- |
  decibels, and I do believe the doors rattled, while he came out
- "backwards from the furnace room at high velocity)''. \n"
- |2
   Something has been said of lecturing styles; Wally's
- |
  pen-pictures are too good not to reproduce in full.
- |
  ``Wishart was actually very friendly to me, and in truth I
- |
  liked him. I was in awe of someone who had a distribution named after
- |
  him, and especially one whose derivation was so dreadfully awkward. He
- |
  lectured very rapidly in a high-pitched squeaky voice with a Scottish
- |
  accent, and wrote very neat notes in very small writing...made me think
- |
  of an economical user of postcards, getting as much information home as
- |
  he could for the least postage.
- |
  ``Henry Daniels' course was on Stochastic Processes, and
- |
  was the one in which I had far and away the most interest, and I very
- |
  much enjoyed it. Though I confess that, even to this day, I often feel
- |
  when I am listening to Henry lecture that he is constantly hinting in a
- |
  mysterious and barely verbal way, as an undercurrent to what he is
- |
  actually saying, that there is a very subtle implication or explanation
- |
  or ramification...which I am far to dumb or unsubtle to understand.
- |
  ``Frank Anscombe...had such a debonair gentlemanly way of
- |
  addressing the class; we were all damn good types meeting in the
- |
  club-room for a jolly good chat about factorial experiments or
- |
  whatever, don't you know; and he had worked the material out with such
- |
  painstaking detail.''
- |2+

- |2
   Wally refers to Dennis Lindley and David Cox repeatedly with
- |
  unreserved gratitude and respect. David made ``everything he discussed
- |
  seem so very very easy and straightforward. One kicked oneself at being
- |
  so stupid as to need any instruction at all on such a seemingly trivial
- |
  matter.'' Dennis's purple hectographed notes on the Kolmogorov
- |
  treatment of probability summarised ``the most important for me of all
- "the lectures I ever attended as a graduate student''. \n"
- |2
   Wally entered research with some travail. ``Henry sent me
- |
  over the road to the Zoology lab to work with a research man called
- |
  J.W.S. Pringle who was obtaining an abundance of photographic records
- |
  of the nerve response of giant South American cockroaches. He would pin
- |
  (literally) the poor but unphotogenic creature to a large block of wax,
- |
  plunge an electrode somewhere into its brain, and then tickle its leg
- |
  with a camel-hair brush...I had little knowledge of the chemistry of
- |
  nerve transmission and so on. Thus the months in which I should have
- |
  been mastering measure theory and semi-groups and Fourier analysis and
- |
  all those other good worthwhile things, I was floundering around trying
- "to teach myself the rudiments of subjects I found very unattractive.'' \n"
- |2
   Before Wally managed to obtain relief from the cockroach Ewan
- |
  Page introduced him to EDSAC, of which both were then early users.
- |
  Relief came via Dennis Lindley, who was then in the middle of his
- |
  classic work on queues. Wally was fascinated by the Wiener-Hopf
- |
  arguments. When Henry took a sabbatical in Chicago in 1952 Wally was
- |
  reassigned to David Cox, ``the two years of work on cockroaches went
- |
  out the window'' and Fourier ideas, Wiener-Hopf theory and renewal
- |
  processes came in. Ewan Page was supervised by Frank Anscombe, of whom
- |
  he speaks with the
- |
  same warmth as does Robin Williams. `Inspirational' he says, with the
- |
  capacity to `let his mind wander' as they discussed problems. When
- |
  Frank took sabbatical leave in Princeton 1953/4 Ewan was taken over by
- |
  David Cox, who warned him: ``I don't have many ideas; I hope you don't
- |
  want me to give you an idea!''.
- |2+

- |2
   Wally and Ewan together wrote a pools forecasting guide one
- |
  weekend, which they tried to publish, without success. However, Ewan
- |
  scored one of the historic triumphs of the Lab the following year
- |
  (1953) when, using random numbers from the Fisher and Yates statistical
- |
  tables, he won a First Division treble chance. According to a
- |
  financially-straitened Wally, ``enough in those days to buy a modest
- "house and a modest new car (if one chose)''. \n"
- |2
   Ewan tells how he was in Dennis Lindley's room one day,
- |
  discussing a change-point problem on the board, when Wishart brought in
- |
  A.C. Aitken. Aitken was of course famed for his feats of memory, and,
- |
  some considerable time later at a seminar in Edinburgh, Ewan challenged
- "him to recall what had been on the board that day. Aitken obliged. \n"
- |2
   Courses were of course given for the Mathematical Tripos as
- |
  well as for the Diploma. Anscombe started and Lindley then developed
- |
  the first Part II course in probability. It had to be entitled `Random
- |
  variables', however -- Jeffreys objected to use of the term
- |
  `Probability', which he reserved to describe his own brand of Bayesian
- "inference. \n"
- |2
   In 1953 the reality of the Laboratory became formally
- |
  recognised. Regulations for the Statistical Laboratory, which covered
- |
  also the post of Director, were proposed by the Faculty Board of
- |
  Mathematics in October 1952 ( Reporter, 1952-53,
- |
  p. 810) and approved by the University on 21st March, 1953. In April
- |
  1953 J. Wishart, still a Reader in Statistics with primary appointment
- "in the Faculty of Agriculture, was appointed Director. \n"
- |2
   Colleagues from that period give Wishart credit for the
- |
  single-mindedness which at last brought the Diploma and the Laboratory
- |
  to being. They give him less credit for sensitivity and tact. He would
- |
  introduce a member of the Lab staff to a visitor as ``My assistant'' -
- |
  save in the case of David Cox. Youth still rested so clearly on David
- "that he was more appropriately introduced as ``My student''. \n"
- |2
   All unknowing, the Statistical Laboratory was now at a zenith
- |
  it would not hold for long and would not reach again for many years -
- |
  some would say `never', in that the character of those times will not
- |
  recur. It was fully set up, with a staff consisting of a Reader
- |
  (Wishart), three University Lecturers (Anscombe and Daniels with a
- |
  recently-promoted Lindley) and one Assistant Lecturer (Cox) plus
- |
  computing staff. It set the pattern and the standard for departments of
- |
  statistics throughout the country. In particular, one can say that the
- |
  Diploma was the model for all the postgraduate courses in statistics
- |
  which have been set up since. The Diploma itself was thriving, and its
- |
  products occupied many of the key statistical posts in the country,
- |
  university posts among them. The staff were leading in research in
- |
  their respective fields: Daniels in stochastic processes,
- |
  position-finding, steepest descents and components of variance,
- |
  Anscombe in the design of experiments and sequential analysis, Lindley
- |
  in inference and decision theory, and Cox in the design of experiments,
- |
  sequential estimation, renewal theory and point processes. Wally Smith
- |
  was just completing his Ph.D. in a late rush: he had developed insights
- |
  into the analytic theory of renewal processes and the like. He and
- "David Cox went on to collaborate fruitfully. \n"
- |2
   All the staff were heavily engaged in consultation for other
- |
  University departments, regarded as one of the prime functions of the
- |
  Lab. Lindley recalls: ``In common with other members of the Lab I did
- |
  some applied work, almost essential in order to provide facilities for
- |
  the Diploma candidates. The one I enjoyed most was for Rothschild on
- |
  the movement of sperm, giving a process that was not Markov of any
- |
  order''. The Lab also had close relations with the statisticians placed
- |
  in other departments, e.g. Norman Bailey in Medicine, Violet Cane in
- |
  Psychology, and Colin Campbell in Agriculture. Norman Bailey held a
- |
  post as Statistician to the Cambridge Medical School 1948/52; he was
- |
  succeeded first by Wally Smith and then by Bob Carpenter. He speaks
- |
  feelingly of the extent to which these lone statisticians relied on the
- |
  Statistical Laboratory for back-up and advice when in need. He also
- |
  wonders whether this increasing dispersion of applied statistics over
- |
  other departments may not, in the course of time, have had some
- "consequences for the central focus. \n"
- |2
   The Faculty recognised the function of the Statistical
- |
  Laboratory, in that so many mathematics graduates found employment in
- |
  statistics, and doubtless recognised the Lab's worth, in that it
- |
  considered its statisticians better than other peoples' statisticians.
- |
  Recognition of the quality of the subject as such was slow to come,
- |
  however, and it was a source of chagrin, particularly to senior members
- |
  of the Laboratory, that their status and function were not acknowledged
- |
  by the offer of a college fellowship. Indeed, no statistician was a
- |
  college fellow at that time; not even Wishart, who had been a Reader
- "for 22 years. \n"
- |2
   On the other hand, the `problem of the non-fellows' was by no
- |
  means particular to the statisticians. The Bridges Report (Reporter
- |
  13/3/1962, p.1075) found that in 1961 only some 500-odd out of 950
- "University Teaching Officers and equivalent held fellowships. \n"
- |2
   William Jackson Hall spent the year 1953/4 in the Lab as a
- |
  Fulbright Scholar, working on his dissertation for the University of
- |
  North Carolina. He remembers particularly Dennis Lindley's good
- |
  research advice, the clouds of pipe-smoke which Henry Daniels generated
- "in seminars and, of course, Ewan Page's pools win. \n"
- |2
   Robert Curnow took the Diploma in 1954/5, the same year as
- |
  Maurice Priestley and Mervyn Stone. The Brunsviga lives in his memory,
- |
  too, as does the occasion when David Cox became vexed by the time the
- |
  class took to invert a 7 ? 7 matrix on it. He also recalls Wishart's
- |
  course on distributions, which stopped at the exciting part: evaluation
- |
  of the fourth moment of the fifth cumulant. Ewan Page likewise shudders
- |
  at the memory of the `acres' of pattern coefficient calculations
- "required for these evaluations. \n"
- |2
   An innovation accompanying the change in status in 1953 was
- |
  the annual photograph of current Laboratory members: staff, computing
- |
  and secretarial staff, research and Diploma students. The rows of these
- |
  photographs on the Laboratory walls fascinate all who call. They
- |
  provide quite the quickest way of determining who was in the Lab when,
- |
  but also constitute an invaluable and evocative historical record. They
- |
  manifest something which has been evident from those days: a sense of
- |
  Laboratory identity and character, an esprit de corps which has
- |
  persisted through weal and woe.
- |
  4.
- |
  1955--61 Disaster and diaspora
- |2
   In 1955 the Laboratory suffered a serious setback when David
- |
  Cox's appointment was not renewed. A University Assistant Lectureship
- |
  was a purely probationary appointment; for three years in the first
- |
  instance, extendable at most to five. It was in fact merely a stage in
- |
  an open competition for one of the restricted number of lectureships; a
- |
  competition in which the statisticians felt that they carried a
- |
  handicap, especially relative to the pure mathematicians. In this case
- "the post indeed went to a pure mathematician. \n"
- |2
   Nevertheless, David Cox was then regarded by the statistical
- |
  world as being of exceptional quality; a view which he has since
- |
  confirmed by becoming the leading figure in British statistics in his
- |
  generation, powerfully bridging probability models, theoretical and
- |
  applied statistics, and repeatedly honoured overseas. That the Faculty
- |
  should not recognise this seemed unjust and inexplicable; an affront to
- |
  both him and the subject. David himself has put the matter behind him;
- |
  it is others who still feel outrage. Norman Bailey writes: ``Feelings
- |
  were very strong, both amongst members of the Statistical Laboratory
- |
  itself and peripheral statisticians in other University departments,
- |
  that the growing and indeed talented mathematical statistical nucleus
- |
  was not being properly recognised, and that this was compounded by no
- |
  offer of college fellowships. I believe that this led to an inevitable
- "diaspora in the years up to around 1957.'' \n"
- |2
   The loss of the youngest staff member was then followed, in a
- |
  most curious way, by the loss of the oldest. In 1956 John Wishart was
- |
  in Mexico, on leave. In July news came through that he had drowned
- "while bathing in the sea off Acapulco. \n"
- |2
   Such events are not only tragic in themselves; they are
- |
  sudden and shattering. Henry Daniels, deputising for Wishart during the
- |
  latter's leave, had now to wind up Wishart's affairs and take charge of
- |
  the Lab as Acting Director. Frank Anscombe left shortly after for a
- |
  post at Princeton, moving later to Yale. In the following year, 1957,
- |
  Henry Daniels himself left to take up the Chair of Mathematical
- "Statistics at Birmingham. \n"
- |2
   Of the five 1955 members of the academic staff of the Lab
- |
  only one then remained in October, 1957: Dennis Lindley. On him fell
- |
  the task of reviving the fortunes of the Lab; he was appointed
- |
  Director. The staff situation had been somewhat shored up, in that
- |
  Wally Smith had been appointed to a ULship in 1956, replacing Frank
- |
  Anscombe. However, he could return to the UK first at the beginning of
- |
  1957. Wally had been rather unsettled (a `yo-yo', says Ewan Page) since
- |
  completing his Ph.D. He had held the post in the Medical School at
- |
  Fenner's 1953/4. Earlier meetings with American visitors to Cambridge
- |
  (Sam Wilks, Harold Hotelling, Leo Goodman, Jimmy Savage) had opened his
- |
  eyes. Far from showing the brashness believed to be the American
- |
  characteristic, they exemplified ``the acme of gentlemanly courtesy''
- |
  and a ``quiet respectfulness'' not to be found in the RSS Research
- |
  Section meetings, for example. So, when offered an attractive post at
- |
  Chapel Hill in 1954, he had taken it, although only after three months'
- |
  indecision and then with many a backward glance to the UK. Ewan Page
- |
  recalls his plaint: ``Don't forget me so quickly!''. In 1956 he took
- "the chance to return to a full Lectureship in Cambridge. \n"
- |2
   After Henry's departure in the summer of 1957 only Dennis and
- |
  Wally were left to carry the full burden of the Lab's teaching and
- |
  activity. Every moment of day and evening was committed; a desperate
- |
  time, although Wally also recalls it as exhilarating. However, Wally
- |
  was dispirited by what Neyman had characterised as the `second-class
- |
  citizen' status of the statisticians in Cambridge, and found the social
- |
  life cold or absent compared with the friendliness and informality of
- |
  Chapel Hill. What must have been a difficult decision and a time of
- |
  deep disillusion is only hinted at in Dennis Lindley's brief
- |
  recollection: ``Wally and Mary paid a visit to our house on the day the
- |
  Russians launched the first Sputnik. Neyman and Elizabeth Scott were
- |
  also there. They had to cycle out to our house in the rain. They
- |
  decided a car in sunny Chapel Hill was better and left soon after.''
- |
  They left in summer, 1958, in fact, although often to return in body,
- |
  and perhaps more often in spirit. Wally never found it easy; his lament
- |
  for the days that had passed should be quoted in full.
- |
  ``I do not think that, outside the blitz, I have lived, or
- |
  will ever again live, through such heroic times as those days seemed to
- |
  be, in retrospect, when Dennis and I alone held the fort. And we did it.
- |
  ``The Statistical Laboratory building is long gone. Smashed
- |
  down. The site is now buried in a large parking garage. [The Lion Yard
- |
  car park.] A few years ago I walked into that garage and tried to
- |
  estimate where my office had been; where I had stood giving that first
- |
  scary seminar talk; where the library had stood, in which I had done so
- |
  much studying and learnt so much, where David Cox first told me what a
- |
  Martingale was (I wonder if he had it right?). Various annoyed
- |
  motorists hooted at me, and I had to dodge cars constantly. I should
- |
  have picked a quieter time. But it was all footling. I could not
- |
  recapture any of it.''
- |2+

- |2
   Dennis had a desperate task to keep the Lab going, although
- |
  he took it evenly enough. There were two immediate recruitments; Morris
- |
  Walker took up a University Lectureship in early 1958 (replacing Henry
- |
  Daniels) and Peter Whittle in late 1959 (replacing Wally Smith).
- |
  Whittle had no previous Cambridge connection at all, and Lindley had to
- |
  press the Faculty hard to secure the appointment, even resorting to the
- |
  then unheard-of extravagance of telephoning New Zealand. In his turn,
- |
  it took Whittle time to become aware of the cross-currents created by
- |
  events, realised and incipient. Some closer personal impressions of
- "these and later years at the Laboratory are given in Whittle (1994). \n"
- |2
   The Laboratory left St Andrew's Hill in 1958. Thanks to some
- |
  uncharacteristic maladroitness of the chemists it was given quarters in
- |
  the basement of the new Chemistry Building in Lensfield Road. Parquet
- |
  floors and lofty ceilings provided a degree of state unimaginable, at
- "any time, to the Faculty of Mathematics. \n"
- |2
   As mentioned, L.J. Savage had already visited Cambridge, in
- |
  1952. Dennis Lindley developed a closer contact with him while on
- |
  sabbatical in Chicago in 1954, and became impressed by his ideas in a
- |
  fashion which was to prove lasting. Savage again visited Cambridge for
- "the summer of 1958 and briefly in 1959. \n"
- |2
   Despite the reduction in its fortunes, the Lab still had a
- |
  wonderful feeling of camaraderie - perhaps because staff and graduate
- |
  students were so close in age. The names of the research students from
- |
  that time are now familiar: Ann Mitchell, John Bather, John Kingman,
- |
  Bob Loynes, Roger Miles, and Hilton Miller. Mervyn Stone had just
- |
  completed. Staff and students seemed always to be adjourning to the
- |
  Spread Eagle together to celebrate the augmentation of someone's
- "family. \n"
- |2
   Donald East was the principal member of the computing staff,
- |
  surviving from the days in Agriculture, when he had acted virtually as
- |
  Wishart's secretary. He used an electromechanical Marchant, Dennis
- |
  Lindley a Facit. The Diploma students at that time were still using the
- |
  manual Brunsvigas of which Jim Durbin spoke; now museum pieces which
- |
  have unfortunately been disposed of. (However, Violet Cane possesses
- "one, and Jeffreys' machines are displayed in DAMTP.) \n"
- |2
   Dennis Lindley left to take up a new chair at Aberystwyth in
- |
  1960. Donald East went too, changing his hobby from gardening to golf.
- |
  This was the first chair in statistics which had been created in the UK
- |
  for several years and there was little reason to expect that it would
- |
  be followed at all soon by others. Dennis also found the Aberystwyth
- |
  prospect attractive. In fact, the expansion of the sixties was about to
- |
  balloon, and there was a quickening even in Cambridge. The possible
- |
  establishment of a chair of statistics, mooted already in 1953, was now
- |
  being discussed more definitely in the Faculty, and colleges were
- "beginning to make cautious overtures to Laboratory staff. \n"
- |2
   The disintegration of the `Wishart' Laboratory should perhaps
- |
  not be seen as a disaster, but as the natural fruiting of success. The
- |
  Laboratory had reached a stage of maturity; that its members should be
- |
  dispersed over other universities was very likely for the general good.
- "The event itself that triggered that dispersal was, of course, tragic. \n"
- |2
   Lindley, the last of the old guard, had a considerable
- |
  influence - broadening, innovatory and lasting - on the activity of the
- |
  Laboratory. The contribution he then made to queueing theory is a
- |
  classic of applied probability, which to this day generates new work.
- |
  His Bayesian enthusiasms are associated with his championing of the
- |
  ideas of L.J. Savage and B. de Finetti, but they also led him to
- |
  decision theory and some of the classic decision problems. This latter
- |
  interest may be seen as the germ of some of the courses in `applicable
- |
  mathematics' which were later to develop. A point of interest: Dennis's
- |
  undergraduate supervisor had been Besicovitch, himself a student of
- "Markov, so Dennis could claim Markov as his academic grandsire. \n"
- |2
   Violet Cane was appointed UL in 1960 to replace Dennis.
- |
  However, Peter Whittle left the next year to succeed Maurice Bartlett
- |
  in the Chair of Mathematical Statistics at Manchester. The Lab
- |
  photograph for 1961/2 is graphic: the total group is now reduced to a
- |
  handful. Morris Walker, taking his turn as Acting Director, peers
- "anxiously into the future. \n"
- |2
   Indeed, the future of the Statistical Laboratory had been
- |
  under consideration for some time; deliberations whose murmur seemed,
- |
  however, not to reach the Lab itself. 
- |
  5.
- |
  1961--66 The Chair of Mathematical Statistics; Resurgence
- |2
   The buffets which the Laboratory had suffered since 1956 had
- |
  brought the Faculty to the realisation that its teaching of statistics
- |
  could be stabilised only by the creation of a senior post in the
- |
  Faculty: a Chair of Statistics. Outside Cambridge, the absence of such
- "a chair was regarded as frankly anomalous. \n"
- |2
   The future form envisaged for the Laboratory was bound up
- |
  with the structure of the Faculty itself, which was at that time
- |
  preparing to divide into the two existing departments. A 1958 Report of
- |
  the Faculty Board to the General Board ( Reporter,
- |
  1958--9, p. 1375) proposed the establishment of a Department of
- |
  Theoretical Statistics and Applied Mathematics, and added ``As regards
- |
  the Statistical Laboratory, its ultimate status is bound up with the
- |
  possible establishment of a Chair of Mathematical Statistics. It may
- |
  well be appropriate to convert the Statistical Laboratory into a
- |
  Department once such a Chair exists, but it would be premature to do so
- "now''. \n"
- |2
   The formal record is unrevealing on the question of whether
- |
  the true initiative for the establishment of a chair came from the
- |
  University itself, but one contributor to this account is in no doubt.
- |
  ``In spite of pressure from Wishart, Lindley, the RSS and probably
- |
  others, Cambridge University declined to create a Chair of Statistics.
- |
  The RSS Council, probably at Lindley's instigation, decided in disgust
- |
  to try and raise enough money to endow a chair. They gave the job to
- |
  the next President, Maurice Kendall. At first he was a bit put out at
- |
  being asked to raise a huge amount of money for another
- |
  university at a time when he was hard at work drumming up support for
- |
  statistics at LSE, but then he threw himself into the task with
- "characteristic generosity and energy and was brilliantly successful.'' \n"
- |2
   The formal records are blander. The Faculty Board's passing
- |
  mention of a Chair quoted above became a firm proposal from the Faculty
- |
  of Mathematics; this is referred to in a report from the Council of the
- |
  Senate to the University in June 1960 ( Reporter,
- |
  1959-60, p. 1684) The establishment of a chair was considered desirable
- |
  ``both because of the long association of the University with advances
- |
  in Mathematical Statistics and the high calibre of Cambridge
- |
  mathematical students, and because...a number of other Faculties who
- |
  call upon the services of the Statistical Laboratory would warmly
- |
  welcome it''. ``The [General] Board have said that they now have reason
- |
  to believe that, by appealing to certain persons and bodies interested
- |
  in the theory and application of the study of statistics, it may be
- |
  possible to secure all or a large part of the funds necessary to
- "maintain the Chair.'' \n"
- |2
   The `reason' mentioned by the General Board was the
- |
  preparedness of the Council of Royal Statistical Society to launch an
- |
  appeal to raise money for the chair. According to the RSS itself, it
- |
  had been approached by the Faculty of Mathematics with a request that
- |
  it ``sponsor an appeal...'' (see J. Roy. Statist. Soc. A
- |
  (1961) 124, p. 562). The Society saw this
- |
  as a good cause and put its full weight behind the venture. Its
- |
  President, Dr Maurice Kendall, was indeed outstandingly active in
- |
  pressing the appeal, which by 1961 had been brought to a successful
- |
  conclusion. The contributing companies and banks are listed in J.
- |
  Roy. Statist. Soc. A (1962) 125
- ", p. 616. \n"
- |2
   The University had agreed to the Council of the Senate's
- |
  proposal. In October 1961 the Council announced the successful
- |
  completion of the appeal ( Reporter , 1961--2, p.
- |
  326); it recommended the establishment of the Professorship and that
- |
  the Professor should be ex officio Director of
- |
  the Statistical Laboratory, whose ``establishment on a firm basis'' the
- |
  Faculty Board of Mathematics regarded ``as a matter of great
- |
  importance''. The University accepted these recommendations without
- "comment. \n"
- |2
   The title of the Professorship corresponded to that of the
- |
  Diploma. The duties of the Professor were not prescribed by any
- |
  ordinance, but the origins of the Laboratory, the involvement of the
- |
  Royal Statistical Society and the appeal to `persons and bodies
- |
  interested in the theory and application of the study of statistics'
- "made clear the intention. \n"
- |2
   The Electors to the new Chair met in May 1962 and elected
- "David Kendall to the post; he took up duties in October of that year. \n"
- |2
   That David Kendall should have been elected was not an
- |
  entirely unexpected outcome, his personal claims on grounds of quality
- |
  being overwhelming. It was a maverick outcome, however, in that David
- |
  was much more obviously a probabilist -- and at that time of fairly
- |
  pure leanings -- than a statistician. The matter has been debated then
- |
  and since, not least because it may be argued that the appointment set
- |
  a precedent for the two subsequent elections to the same post. One
- |
  point that must be made is that the Board of Electors was a balanced
- |
  one (with the RSS represented by its President, Maurice Kendall), well
- |
  aware of the nature of the case that had been made both for the post
- |
  and for the appeal which supported it, and the Board certainly
- |
  considered all factors in reaching its decision. An interesting light
- |
  is thrown by Dennis Lindley. He writes that, at the time when he was
- |
  considering whether or not to apply for the Aberystwyth post, ``Maurice
- |
  Kendall was well-advanced in his appeal for money for a chair at
- |
  Cambridge, and had politely made clear to me that David Kendall would
- |
  get it''. The coincidence of surnames is fortuitous -- Maurice and
- |
  David are unrelated -- so Maurice's intention, typically robust, was
- |
  disinterest itself. The quotation makes clear that Maurice was not
- |
  ambushed by other Electors, although another account represents this
- |
  rather as a reluctant acceptance of the fact that David Kendall was
- "intrinsically the strongest candidate. \n"
- |2
   More to the point, one can maintain that David Kendall
- |
  subsequently met the criticisms, in that he became a statistician in
- |
  his own individual way, and an ingenious and enthusiastic one. In
- |
  addition to his continuing work in pure probability (Markov processes,
- |
  stochastic analysis and geometry and random sets) and applied
- |
  probability models (bird navigation, structure of the retina, epidemic
- |
  waves and rumours) he became deeply interested in the inference and
- |
  reconstruction problems of archaeology, such as grave sequencing, the
- |
  reconstruction of local maps from information on contiguity etc., and
- |
  the recognition of regularities such as quanta of measurement and the
- |
  placement patterns of standing stones. These applications all had a
- |
  particular sense of intangibility, and were in fact pioneering and
- "advanced examples of the analysis of latent variable models. \n"
- |2
   David Kendall also `strove for statistics' (in David
- |
  McLaren's phrase) at the operational level. he made efforts to
- |
  establish contacts with statisticians in applied posts, such as Colin
- |
  Campbell and Bob Carpenter; he secured David McLaren (who had joined
- |
  the group from Manchester as a research student), appointment as a
- |
  senior Assistant in research (later an Assistant Director of Research),
- |
  with partial responsibility for statistical consulting, he set up a
- |
  course on inference in Part IB and pioneered the use of TITAN in the
- "Lab. \n"
- |2
   David's appointment brought one immediate political benefit
- |
  to the Laboratory; the mathematicians recognised David as one of their
- |
  own, with the consequence that the standing in the Faculty which the
- |
  Laboratory had earned but not received was now granted overnight. John
- |
  Kingman, now a Fellow of Pembroke and a member of the Lab, was also
- |
  greatly influenced in bringing about change in attitude. Harold
- |
  Davenport's reported reaction to the appointment was: ``Eeh, I did
- |
  worry about who we might get, but eeh, we got a Professor of Statistics
- |
  who knows about lattice points!''. The colleges opened their doors and,
- |
  indeed, from that time there has generally been competition to secure
- "the services of Laboratory staff as teaching fellows. \n"
- |2
   This rapport brought other consequences, however. Given the
- |
  will, the Laboratory could indeed have become a separate department.
- |
  However, it would then have been expected to unify of statistics in the
- |
  University, so reversing the dispersion Norman Bailey mentions. In
- |
  particular, it would have been expected to absorb the statisticians
- |
  rather loosely attached to other Faculties such as Agriculture and
- |
  Medicine and probably to provide service teaching -- teaching for
- |
  Faculties other than Mathematics. Such a course would have meant an
- |
  increase in role but a change in character; there are obvious arguments
- |
  both for and against it. In the event, the Laboratory joined the pure
- |
  mathematicians to constitute the existing Department of Pure
- "Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics (DPMMS). \n"
- |2
   The Lab was still housed in the basement of the Chemistry
- |
  Building when David arrived in 1962. It was honoured in the first term
- |
  by a courtesy call from Fisher. He was carrying a stout stick; John
- |
  Kingman later affected to believe that this was for the administration
- |
  of a cudgelling in case of displeasure. In fact, the occasion seems to
- "have been totally amicable, ending in lunch. \n"
- |2
   John may be playing down his own doughtiness; david McLaren
- |
  recalls the seminar which Fisher had given in Cambridge the previous
- |
  summer. in David's words ``A very recent graduate of the Diploma, I
- |
  arrived rather too promptly, when Fisher was already on his feet.
- |
  However, he insisted on shaking my hand most warmly; presumably his
- |
  short sight prevented him from being sure that I was not the
- "Vice-Chancellor\". \n"
- |2
   Fisher's topic was `Sampling the reference set'. John Kingman
- |
  bravely took issue with some of this, advancing to the blackboard to
- |
  demonstrate some counter-argument. Fisher started swinging his stick in
- |
  a most menacing way, not amicable at all. Eventually he dismissed John
- "by demanding \"What does it matter if the mouse is a Unitarian?\".\" \n"
- |2
   In 1964 the whole Faculty was concentrated at the former
- |
  Printing House in Mill Lane, rendered vacant by the University Press's
- |
  move to new premises. The Statistical Laboratory moved with the rest of
- |
  DPMMS into the warehouse building. One may now begin to use the present
- |
  tense. The Mill Lane building is not an elegant one, but it is
- |
  conveniently sited and has served the Department well. Strongly and
- |
  squatly built around a steel frame with a full-plan basement, it rather
- |
  incongruously suggests a war-time bunker. The ground is weak near the
- |
  surface of the river bank; the bridging of the Cam at this point has
- |
  historically presented a civil engineering challenge. As a consequence,
- |
  the Pure wing (the `old warehouse') of the L-shaped building tends to
- |
  slip away from the Statistical wing (the `new warehouse'), giving rise
- |
  to the `Daniels fault' at the junction -- a vertical crack which indeed
- "staggers the window of Henry Daniels' present room. \n"
- |2
   John Kingman accompanied David from Oxford in 1962, as a UAL.
- |
  He was upgraded to UL from April, 1964, at the end of which year he
- |
  left for a term's sabbatical and a post in Brighton. It was immediately
- |
  before his departure and before the move to Mill Lane that John
- |
  rendered his last great service to the Lab. John was a very junior
- |
  member of the committee concerned with allocation of space in the Mill
- |
  Lane building; he saw reconnoitre as his first necessity. ``The credit
- |
  for getting into the warehouse lies with Violet, who had a friend
- |
  (whose name I had better suppress) in the Press. Thus Violet and I got
- |
  into the warehouse, by then cleared of paper but having no internal
- |
  walls except that between the old and the new warehouses. With its iron
- |
  stanchions holding up the heavy floors it was like being on a C19th
- |
  sailing ship.'' However, it turned out that the appointed Master of the
- |
  vessel (Sir William Hodge) had already provisionally consigned the
- |
  Statistical Laboratory to the bilges (the basement -- commodious but
- |
  dismal). Thither it would indeed have been cast had not the brave cabin
- |
  boy (John Kingman) spoken up, sturdily enough that he secured for the
- |
  Lab all of the upper two decks (the upper two floors of the new
- |
  warehouse) aft of the sole bulkhead (the aforesaid wall). John now had
- |
  a free hand in the partitioning of this space. Perhaps in reaction to
- |
  the depths into which he had peered, he was particularly insistent that
- |
  there should be a large common-room with many soft chairs and no
- "blackboards. \n"
- |2
   When David Kendall arrived in 1962 the staff consisted just
- |
  of Violet Cane and Morris Walker, with now the addition of John
- |
  Kingman. On this slight but genetically-rich base the Laboratory began
- |
  to develop life again, in somewhat mutated form. Alfred R?nyi (soon to
- |
  die tragically early) was a visitor in 1963/4 and Jessie McWilliams,
- |
  Joe Kruskal and Ronald Pyke in 1964/5. Through his connections with the
- |
  Atlas Laboratory at Harwell David managed to arrange an Atlas
- |
  Fellowship at Churchill. John Hartigan held this in 1963/4 and helped
- |
  out with lecturing (while Morris Walker was on sabbatical leave in
- |
  Australia). Roy Hodson held it for a time after that -- David was by
- |
  this time well into his archaeological phase. David was elected FRS in
- |
  1964. In that year John Kingman left for Brighton and was replaced by
- |
  Bob Loynes, from Manchester. Bob Bechofer, who visited in 1966/7, was
- |
  prevailed upon to lecture. When leaving he confided to David, in
- "amiable honesty: ``Your statistics is terrible!''. \n"
- |2
   It is not practicable to follow the passage of individual
- |
  research students in the same detail as that of staff. What is natural
- |
  is to recall the members of the research-student group at the times -
- |
  quite definite - when this was especially flourishing. Some notable
- |
  singletons are then likely to be missed; they should be sure that they
- "are remembered. \n"
- |2
   The research students played a particular role during these
- |
  recovery years in giving the group substance; David McLaren, Nick
- |
  Bingham, Daryl Daley, Charles Goldie, John Haigh, Peter Lee, David
- "Mannion, and Jane Speakman speak to us from the photographs. \n"
- |2
   David Williams performed his first transit of the Lab in
- |
  1966/7, when he held a Research Fellowship at Clare. He recurs. Nick
- |
  Bingham recalls him from that time as ``a force of nature -
- |
  unforgettable for linguistic as well as mathematical reasons''.
- |
  6.
- |
  1966--72: The Churchill Chair;
- |
  Redefinition
- |2
   There was a continuing concern to bring up the Lab's strength
- |
  and, in particular, to restore its historic strength in statistics.
- |
  Esso Petroleum Ltd seemed disposed to be helpful, and David Kendall had
- |
  conversations with Leo Govier of that firm. Initial suggestions were
- |
  modest: that support might be provided for a Diploma student. A year or
- |
  more of discussion, back-reference and variation led to something
- |
  startingly more ambitious: Esso generously endowed the Churchill Chair
- |
  in the Mathematics of Operations Research. This was to be located in
- |
  the Faculty of Mathematics; more specifically, in the Statistical
- "Laboratory. \n"
- |2
   The new chair was advertised in 1966. Peter Whittle was
- |
  elected to the post in August of that year and took up duties in July
- |
  1967. The number of people in the UK who might be said to be
- |
  knowledgeable in the mathematics of OR was small, but Whittle's
- |
  increasing interest in optimisation was deemed sufficiently qualifying,
- "and made the move an appropriate one as far as he was concerned. \n"
- |2
   There may have been an expectation in some quarters that the
- |
  new professor would be, effectively, a professor of statistics, so
- |
  restoring the desired balance. However, Whittle saw the matter in a
- |
  more literal light. For one thing, Esso's intention was clearly that
- |
  the post should be in operational research. But, more than that,
- |
  Whittle considered that what needed development was, not just
- |
  narrow-sense operational research, but the whole area for which there
- |
  is still no good name, but which is variously called `applicable
- |
  mathematics' or `non-physical applied mathematics'. This includes, for
- |
  example, probability, statistics, optimisation, systems theory, game
- |
  theory and those aspects of disciplines such as control theory,
- |
  communication theory and mathematical economics which might be pursued
- |
  by someone technically based in probability and optimisation.
- |
  Developments in the USA since the war have demonstrated, not only the
- |
  practical importance of these topics, but also the depth and coherence
- "of the theory they generate. \n"
- |2
   Surprisingly, Cambridge was ready for these developments.
- |
  Both students and other Faculties had been pressing the Faculty of
- |
  Mathematics to modernise its coverage in precisely these areas, and the
- |
  Faculty had conceded the case. So, the proposal of new Part II courses
- |
  (in convex optimisation, dynamic optimisation and statistical
- |
  communication theory, as it turned out) was welcomed, rather than met
- |
  with the incredulity and resistance which precedent would have led one
- |
  to expect. The new courses had a chequered beginning, but ultimately
- |
  took shape and became accepted components of the Tripos. One may say
- |
  that the optimisation courses have not prospered as they should, but
- |
  the changes in courses and staff anticipated for 1994 promise
- "regeneration. \n"
- |2
   Statisticians outside Cambridge may have watched the partial
- |
  displacement of statistics in Cambridge by probability and
- |
  optimisation, etc. with some dismay, seeing this as an abandonment of
- |
  honourable traditions or a snobbish mathematical elitism. They could
- |
  not be more wrong. There is surely substance in the view that the
- |
  complacency lay outside Cambridge rather than
- |
  within. The many departments of statistics in the country interpreted
- |
  their brief far too narrowly - more narrowly than Galton or Fisher
- |
  would have found natural! It was Cambridge which saw the lack and tried
- |
  to remedy it; a task requiring much hard work and inducing some
- |
  humility. Further, contrary to general belief, Cambridge has continued
- |
  throughout to recognise the special role of statistics and tried to
- |
  restore its own strength in this area. The attempt to cover much of
- |
  applicable mathematics with a smaller staff than is devoted to
- |
  statistics alone in many universities has made this difficult. However,
- |
  strenuous efforts have been made to bring statistics to its proper
- |
  representation, and 1994 may see also these efforts crowned with
- "success. \n"
- |2
   The visitors for the year 1967/8 included Ingram Olkin, Al
- |
  Marshall, Mike Perlman and, again, Alfred R?nyi . Olkin and Marshall
- |
  started a seminar series on inequalities, attended by R?nyi among
- |
  others. This was novel both in content and format: it provided the
- |
  first local experience of a `bag seminar', to which one brought one's
- |
  lunch. Ingram and Al presented their developing ideas on majorisation
- |
  at this seminar, ideas which constituted the basis of their later text
- |
  on the subject. Al also took the chance to enlarge his collection of
- "old flutes. \n"
- |2
   Anthony Edwards was attached to the Lab 1968/70, and began a
- |
  course in Mathematical Genetics which remains a standing option in the
- |
  Diploma, although Anthony sees this course as a development of on begun
- |
  by Fisher and George Owen in 1952/3. While his primary interest is
- |
  mathematical genetics, Anthony is a scholar of both statistical
- |
  inference and the history of statistics in Cambridge; most of the
- |
  formal record in sections 2, 3 and 5 of this account is derived from
- |
  his 1991 notes. His book Likelihood (1972,
- |
  Cambridge University Press) was written during his period of
- |
  attachment. One may also see him as the high priest of those who tend
- |
  the memory of Fisher in the sacred groves of Caius (of which college
- |
  Fisher was a Fellow, as is Anthony). He read a paper to the Royal
- |
  Statistical Society in 1969 on the estimation of evolutionary trees ( J.
- |
  Roy. Statist. Soc. B (1970) 32
- |
  , 155--208). Solution of this difficult and fascinating problem was
- |
  later taken considerably further by his research student, Elizabeth
- |
  Thompson. Robin Sibson tackled the same problem in a different way in
- |
  his study with Nick Jardine of dendrogram techniques (Jardine, N. and
- |
  Sibson, R. (1970) Mathematical Taxonomy, Wiley).
- |
  Both Elizabeth and Robin were appointed at that time to University
- |
  Lectureships in the Lab; Robin from 1970 and Elizabeth from 1971. This
- |
  activity again demonstrates the falsity of the impression that
- |
  statistics lapsed in the Lab after the fifties: the estimation of
- |
  evolutionary trees is an important, subtle and difficult statistical
- |
  problem; exactly the kind of problem that many mainstream statisticians
- "will regard as lying outside their brief. \n"
- |2
   Books published by the staff must serve as an informative if
- |
  insufficient statistic of activity. Peter Whittle published Optimisation
- |
  under Constraints (1971, Wiley) as a text for one of the
- |
  optimisation courses and Probability (1970,
- |
  Penguin). Since this latter took the unconventional approach of
- |
  axiomatising the expectation functional, it was unlikely to be adopted
- |
  for any course, but it was interestingly parallel to the work by de
- |
  Finetti, appearing in English just at that time, which Dennis Lindley
- "so espoused. \n"
- |2
   John Gittins was also loosely attached to the Lab in 1969/70.
- |
  It was at this time that he was developing his solution of the
- |
  multi-armed bandit problem, motivated by the need for a rational
- |
  approach to the allocation of exploratory research effort he had
- |
  encountered while working with Unilever. The multi-armed bandit problem
- |
  was the problem of decision theory over the years
- |
  1945-1980; it embodies the essential problem of balancing
- |
  experimentation against immediate dividend, but seemed so difficult
- |
  that people of some mathematical sophistication regarded it as
- |
  intrinsically insoluble in any conventional sense. Few would have
- |
  believed it if they had been told in 1969 that John had slain the
- |
  dragon. It would be 1979/80 before his classic advance was recognised,
- |
  since when it has transformed a large part of the subject of stochastic
- "scheduling. \n"
- |2
   Violet Cane was instrumental in bringing in the rule that the
- |
  Head of the new department, DPMMS, should be appointed for only five
- |
  years at a time, rather than until retirement. Thus it was that Sir
- "William Hodge yielded the Headship to Ian Cassels in 1969. \n"
- |2
   The unlikely symbiosis of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical
- |
  Statistics might not have succeeded but for Cassels' sympathetic and
- |
  enlightened attitude. A distinguished number theorist himself, Cassels
- |
  could see, not only that a high proportion of the Faculty's graduates
- |
  found a career in statistics and related disciplines, but also that
- |
  these subjects were intrinsically interesting. Indeed, he was the first
- |
  mathematician to give the Part II course in Mathematical Economics
- |
  (previously given by a member of the Faculty of Economics), developing
- |
  and publishing his own course text. It was Ian who repeatedly
- |
  encouraged the Lab to think big. This venturesome attitude was in
- |
  contrast to his lesser concern for domestic matters. When money had to
- |
  be found it was always taken off the cleaning budget, which, despite
- |
  its consequent exponential decline, always seemed to have some capacity
- "for sacrifice left in it. \n"
- |2
   In 1969 David McLaren left for a post in Glasgow;
- |
  cross-border balance was preserved by recruitment of Ted Harding from
- "Edinburgh. His was regarded as a post in statistics. \n"
- |2
   Robin Sibson was appointed in 1970 to a new University
- |
  Lectureship notionally assigned to Operational Research. He developed a
- |
  later interest in optimal experimental design, a subject experiencing a
- |
  renaissance at that time, and in which Cambridge, Imperial College and
- |
  Glasgow for a while formed a triumvirate. All three groups enjoyed
- |
  visits from Valery Federov, who had just written his book on the
- |
  subject. The pleasantness of his company was not diminished by the
- "possibility that he was perhaps more than a simple academic. \n"
- |2
   Another statistical appointment was made in 1970. Pat Altham
- |
  was appointed as Assistant Director of Research (ADR) and also given
- |
  specific responsibility for the running of the Diploma by being
- |
  nominated Director of Studies. She had continued in these duties ever
- |
  since (although later as UL) and has become less dispensable than
- |
  anybody should be allowed to be. As a relic of her ADRship Pat fields
- |
  the statistical queries that come in both from other departments and
- |
  from outside the University, and herself deals with most of them. As
- |
  Director of Studies she does much of the teaching for the Diploma
- |
  itself plus all of the administration: e.g. the organisation of
- |
  admissions, courses, examinations and applied projects. The project
- |
  retains its central role in the Diploma course, but to find applied
- |
  areas of the right level and interest equipped with a willing applied
- |
  supervisor is by no means easy. In fact, the scheme is workable only
- |
  because of the contacts and goodwill Pat has built up through her
- "consultation work. \n"
- |2
   David Kendall's `fields of application' continued to be
- |
  archaeology and astronomy, but there were outliers. A pig-breeder
- |
  called to see him, and David listened, silently but sympathetically, to
- |
  a long discourse on swine fever. At the end of this his client rose and
- |
  thanked him cordially for a most valuable discussion. Years later the
- |
  same man wrote, recalling the conversation and thanking David profusely
- |
  for opening his mind to totally new insights on the question of swine
- "fever. \n"
- |2
   The Laboratory suffered a sad loss in the summer of 1970 by
- |
  the death of Rollo Davidson in a climbing accident in the Alps. Rollo
- |
  had been a research student in the Lab, had held a Junior Research
- |
  Fellowship at Trinity and just been elected to a Teaching Fellowship at
- |
  Churchill. He was regarded as being of quite exceptional promise. Rollo
- |
  had published on Delphic semi-groups, p-functions and stochastic
- |
  geometry, and was beginning to pose questions in statistics and
- |
  optimisation. The talent that had been lost was commemorated by the
- |
  compilation of two memorial volumes (eds. Kendall and Harding, 1973 and
- |
  1974). The income from these was used to found the Rollo Davidson
- |
  Trust, from which prizes for distinguished research by younger workers
- "have been awarded annually since 1976. \n"
- |2
   A course introduced about this time was based on a suggestion
- |
  of Rollo's, which he would have developed himself had he lived. This
- |
  was the `Markov methods' course in Part IB. A need was felt for a
- |
  probability course of an applied character; to build it around the
- |
  Markov theme gave a natural lead into stochastic processes. As nobility
- |
  is said to need the constant (if covert) infusion of common blood to
- |
  maintain its vigour, so probability courses need a constant reminder of
- |
  applications if they are not to waft themselves to Gallic heights and
- |
  disappear. This seems to be a law of nature, and is the reason why
- "probability is too important to be left to the probabilists. \n"
- |2
   In 1971 Violet Cane left for the Manchester chair. She was
- |
  replaced by Elizabeth Thompson, a formidable young lady who handled all
- |
  the statistics courses with laconic ease. Elizabeth naturally took over
- |
  the Mathematical Genetics course as well, and tackled the Communication
- |
  Theory course (which a few loved and most would not touch) with relish
- |
  -- perhaps because it gave her a chance to talk about DNA sequences.
- |
  Her work on inference problems for evolutionary trees continued; in
- |
  1975 she was to publish Human Evolutionary Trees
- |
  (Cambridge University Press).
- |
  7.
- |
  1972-85 Comings and goings
- |
   
- |
  The terms of the Chair of Mathematical Statistics made the Professor ex
- |
  officio Director of the Laboratory. However, these had been
- |
  formulated in the days when the Laboratory had but one chair. Perhaps
- |
  David Kendall was aware of the belief that eleven or twelve years is
- |
  the maximal natural term of office; in any case, in 1973 he managed to
- |
  have the tie loosed and Peter Whittle appointed as Director.
- |2+

- |2
   The new stage was set in the pleasantest fashion by the
- |
  appointment of Geoff Eagleson to a ULship and the appearance of Bruce
- |
  Brown as a visitor in 1972. Geoff Eagleson played a profoundly positive
- |
  role in the Laboratory; in teaching, research, student contact and the
- |
  good thrift of the Laboratory generally. When one thinks back to the
- |
  founding fathers of the Laboratory, one regards them as examples of
- |
  ancient virtue which cannot be equalled. However, in dedication and
- |
  character Geoff equalled anybody. He is one of a whole sequence of
- |
  Australians who have contributed to the Laboratory's life and success.
- |
  Bruce Brown was conspicuously another, but one thinks particularly of
- |
  the magnificent succession of research students: Daryl Daley, John
- |
  Pollard, Richard Tweedie, Tim Brown, Iain MacPhee, Phil Pollett, Adrian
- |
  Baddeley, Alan Branford, Steve Evans, Ben Hambly, Terence Chan, Steve
- |
  Hanly, Nigel Bean, Jo Kennedy and Owen Jones. These were all good, some
- |
  of them the very best, and they have kept the Lab's graduate research
- |
  going at times when UK recruitment was thin. After all these years one
- |
  may reveal a fact known to Charles Goldie: that John Pollard secretly
- "doubled up his studies for his Ph.D. and his actuarial examinations. \n"
- |2
   In fact, recruitment was by no means thin in the early/mid
- |
  seventies, which was one of those periods when the research-student
- |
  group developed a particularly vivid and productive life of its own.
- |
  One recalls David Aldous, Frank Kelly, John Kent, Bill McGinley, David
- "Probert, Brian Ripley, Jeremy Rudge and Bernie Silverman. \n"
- |2
   Geoff Eagleson worked closely with Andrew Barbour, who had
- |
  been associated with the Lab from 1969; successively as Diploma
- |
  student, research student, Fellow of Caius and Director of Studies for
- |
  that college. Andrew made a succession of strong advances in
- |
  probability on the pure/applied borderline. His talents were recognised
- "adequately first when he was appointed to a chair in Z?rich in 1984. \n"
- |2
   Ian Cassels' continued exhortation and support bore fruit in
- |
  1974 in the form of another Lectureship, to be notionally assigned to
- |
  Operational Research. Doug Kennedy was appointed; immediately from
- |
  Sheffield but, before that, from Trinity College Dublin and Stanford.
- |
  With his Stanford background Doug was the only staff member with any
- "formal OR training. \n"
- |2
   Life was enriched when Wally Smith, Joel Cohen and John
- |
  Hajnal spent a sabbatical year at the Lab in 1974/5 and Henry Daniels
- |
  in 1975/6. It was a particular pleasure to have Henry and Wally back -
- |
  a link with the St Andrew's Hill days. Henry divided his time between
- |
  the Lab and the King's College Research Centre, where he was charged
- "with the organisation of a seminar in mathematical biology. \n"
- |2
   Various references have been made to the less than palatial
- |
  housing of the Department. In this connection, Kevin Donnelly (research
- |
  student 1976/9, now answering to Caoimhin O Donnaile) tells how he
- |
  found Thomas Bruss (research student from Germany, now in Brussels)
- |
  taking a photograph of the main entry to the Department, a warehouse
- |
  back-door flanked by milk-bottles and randomly-packed bicycles. He
- |
  intended to send this to his parents, who could not otherwise be
- |
  convinced that such a prestigious department was to be approached
- |
  through such portals. Kevin also tells a story which charity bids us
- |
  dismiss as apocryphal. One student was heard asking another the purpose
- |
  of the gigantic rubbish bins outside the actual back-door of the
- |
  Department. His friend explained that these were for discarded notes
- |
  and that ``they are sometimes picked through by Oxford research
- "students desperate for material for their theses''. \n"
- |2
   Alistair Mees was appointed to a ULship in 1975, again
- |
  notionally allocated to Operational Research. It was always difficult
- |
  to find staff in OR; since there were virtually no mathematically
- |
  advanced courses in OR in the country very few had such a training.
- |
  With luck one could find someone with USA training (as in Doug
- |
  Kennedy's case) or else someone of approximating interests and
- |
  sufficient enthusiasm to bridge the gap (as in Robin Sibson's case).
- |
  The latter was the case also for Alistair. He had worked in control
- |
  theory, largely in the analysis of nonlinear systems, and later won an
- |
  Adams Prize for his essay Dynamics of Feedback Systems
- |
  em> (Wiley, 1981). While maintaining his interest in nonlinear
- |
  dynamics he also moved seriously and permanently into optimisation and
- "associated algorithmics. \n"
- |2
   Jim Pitman was appointed to a ULship in 1976, bringing both
- |
  the highest standards in probability and an honoured name. Jim's
- |
  natural sphere is the USA and in 1978 he returned to Berkeley. He was
- |
  replaced by the appointment of Frank Kelly to a ULship. This meant
- |
  reiving a valued young member of staff from the Control and Management
- |
  Studies Group of the Department of Engineering, but its Head, Alastair
- |
  MacFarlane, bore no grudge. Relations of the Lab with the Department of
- |
  Engineering have always been good, particularly with Control
- |
  Engineering and with Management Studies (which for a time had a joint
- |
  existence but are now again separate). There are natural communities of
- |
  interest, of course, although this is in general no guarantee of
- |
  amicability, and there has been movement of members between the groups
- |
  in both directions (e.g. John Gittins, Stephen Watson, Frank Kelly and
- "Richard Weber). \n"
- |2
   Frank's return was to have profound long-term consequences
- |
  for the Lab. It was a return, because Frank had been a Ph.D. student in
- |
  the Lab 1973/6. He had been supervised by Peter Whittle in the area of
- |
  Jackson networks, with its associated reversibility and balance
- |
  concepts. This class of ideas turned out to be butter to Frank's
- |
  remarkable intuition. Frank achieved extensions of the Jackson theory
- |
  not only for the queueing context but also for other and apparently
- |
  unrelated application areas. His book Reversibility and
- |
  Stochastic Networks (Wiley, 1979) demonstrated the striking
- "unification thus achieved, and made Frank's name instantaneously. \n"
- |2
   The tempo seemed to increase in those years. Peter Whittle
- |
  was elected FRS in 1978. His discovery in 1979 of an alternative proof
- |
  of the optimality of the Gittins index policy for the multi-armed
- |
  bandit problem had the effect of bringing about the long-overdue
- "recognition of John Gittins' solution of the problem. \n"
- |2
   Retiring professors were also beginning to home back to the
- |
  Lab: Henry Daniels from Birmingham in 1978 and Violet Cane from
- |
  Manchester in 1981. That Violet should return was expected, since she
- |
  had kept her cottage in Little St Mary's Lane. However, that Henry
- |
  should wish to do so was both surprising and gratifying. Henry had a
- |
  respect for red-brick virtues and found these notably lacking in
- |
  Cambridge; the college slights of earlier years still rankled. However,
- |
  perhaps he found some of the Lab's work in applied probability to his
- |
  taste. The reverse compliment certainly holds; he is held in high
- |
  regard and affection, and is doughty enough in controversy to be
- |
  allowed no quarter, despite his age. He was elected FRS in 1980,
- |
  bringing the Lab count to three. Belated but generous justice was
- |
  achieved by David Williams in 1992, when Henry was made an Honorary
- "Fellow of Clare. \n"
- |2
   Manfred Gordon, a polymer chemist who had published classic
- |
  work on the statistics of polymers with Jack Good, had been a visitor
- |
  in the Lab 1972/3. In 1978 he retired from Essex and also took up
- |
  residence in the Lab. Manfred had hoped that the interest in the
- |
  probabilistic aspects of polymerisation which he shared with Peter
- |
  Whittle would form the basis for some real programme. Alas, the
- |
  Laboratory was in its familiar quandary of having to split its limited
- |
  human capital too many ways, and simply could not afford this venture.
- |
  Interestingly, B?la Bollob?s and his stable of random graph theorists
- |
  were working along parallel lines, although in a style different enough
- |
  that collaboration was never natural. However, Manfred, even if
- |
  disappointed, continues to illuminate the Lab with his gentle erudition
- "and wide culture. \n"
- |2
   Martin Barlow was appointed to a ULship in 1982. He
- |
  reinforced the extraordinarily high quality of the group, many of them
- |
  research students, working on stochastic integrals, stochastic
- |
  differential equations and flows and spatial processes on strange
- "manifolds. \n"
- |2
   In 1983 there was a contentious move, in a literal sense. The
- |
  DPMMS library, which had been housed on the first floor of the DPMMS
- |
  building, was moved into the library vacated by the Faculty of Classics
- |
  at the top of the Mill Lane Lecture Block, just over the road. The old
- |
  quarters had been cramped; the new quarters are not merely roomy, but
- |
  also beautiful. The former Classics Library is light, lofty and
- |
  elegant; a sequence of two-tiered galleried bays in light oak is
- |
  suffused by a clear natural light from above. Undoubtedly some
- |
  convenience has been lost in the translation, probably more from the
- |
  vertical component than the horizontal one. However, this is perhaps
- |
  one case when academics' known inability to refuse an offer has led to
- "the right outcome. \n"
- |2
   Publications again: in 1981 Elizabeth Thompson published Genealogical
- |
  and Genetic Structure with Chris Cannings (Cambridge
- |
  University Press) and in 1982/3 Peter Whittle published the two-volume Optimisation
- "over Time (Wiley). \n"
- |2
   There were a number of losses in 1984. The Lab lost a friend
- |
  in office when Ian Cassels retired. Martin Barlow resigned to
- |
  concentrate on research, and Alistair Mees resigned to take up a chair
- "in Western Australia. \n"
- |2
   With the loss of Alistair the difficulty of finding an OR
- |
  replacement had again to be faced. It was solved by the appointment of
- |
  Colin Sparrow, highly regarded for his work in nonlinear dynamics,
- |
  notably chaos theory. Colin's actions are based on pragmatism and
- |
  principle; convention is not so much disregarded as irrelevant. To fill
- |
  a longish gap between graduation and the securing of a post in King's
- |
  he had driven a bus in Cambridge and had sold ice-cream on King's
- |
  Parade (wearing a top-hat, to the tourists' delight). The appointment
- |
  stretched the range of interests represented in the Laboratory by more
- |
  than was wise or comfortable, but the Lab has benefited greatly from
- |
  Colin's idiosyncratic virtues.
- |
  8.
- |
  1985--92 Martingales and the Mabinogion
- |2+

- |
  David Kendall was due to retire in 1985. The usual measures were taken
- |
  to advertise the post, in the sober and sincere intention that a
- |
  genuine statistician should be appointed if possible. However, that the
- |
  Lab is part of the Faculty of Mathematics places its own constraints.
- |
  One has to meet the standards of the Faculty (the students would be
- |
  merciless towards anyone who did not) and the Lab now had its own
- |
  developed standards as a group in applicable mathematics.
- |2
   It is perhaps not divulging too much to say that there were
- |
  two very strong statistical figures in the running; one of these
- |
  ultimately withdrew and the other presented special problems. The
- |
  Electors were then faced with a rerun of the 1962 scenario; David
- |
  Williams was so clearly the strongest residual candidate that he was
- |
  elected. He then joined the Laboratory in 1985. Two others effectively
- |
  came with him from Swansea; Chris Rogers was appointed as a UL and, in
- |
  1986, James Norris to a New Blood post as UAL. With these two
- |
  appointments the strength of the Lab in pure probability was clearly
- "maintained, and its average age decreased. \n"
- |2
   David Williams brought the highest degree of professional
- |
  strength, together with a particular warmth and generosity of
- |
  personality. Sensitive to the possible charge of mathematical
- |
  preciousness (which he of all people could have disregarded) he
- |
  lectured and supervised a whole range of courses in probability and
- |
  statistics. He gave two graduate lecture series (Connections and
- |
  Percolation) which bridged probability, modern physics and pure
- |
  mathematics with rare power and evoked sustained interest from the
- |
  staff of the whole Faculty. His breadth manifested itself in the truest
- |
  fashion; students left David's courses knowing something of the
- "Mabinogion as well as of martingales. \n"
- |2
   In retirement David Kendall developed his study of
- |
  standing-stone configurations into a `theory of shape', working with a
- |
  very bright visitor from mainland China: Huiling Le. In the following
- |
  years he was awarded the Royal Statistical Society's Guy Medal in Gold
- |
  and the De Morgan Medal of the London Mathematical Society,
- |
  complementing the Sylvester Medal already awarded by the Royal Society.
- |
  However, David maintains that it is his founding of the Bernoulli
- |
  Society, jointly with Jerzy Neyman, which gives him the greatest
- "satisfaction. \n"
- |2
   David Kendall continued to occupy a room in the Lab and use
- |
  computing facilities. University departments vary widely in their
- |
  practice towards retired members. University policy must of course be
- |
  that they have no rights, and departments under the severest resource
- |
  pressures must also see it this way. However, groups which consider
- |
  that they can both stretch resources and avoid the problems an
- |
  insensitive senior retir? might pose do in fact offer a continuing
- |
  home. Henry Daniels had been given a room on this basis, as David was
- |
  now. Violet Cane and Manfred Gordon had received partial facilities on
- |
  the same basis. One must not see this practice as resting on pure
- |
  charity or sentiment; the `Advanced Fellows' offer depth to the group
- |
  in several ways, and their presence is often particularly appreciated
- |
  by the youngest members of the group: the graduate students. One might
- |
  also say that any other attitude would scarcely be consistent with a
- "healthy feeling of group identity. \n"
- |2
   It was in 1986 that Elizabeth Thompson published her Pedigree
- |
  Analysis in Human Genetics (Johns Hopkins Press) and then
- |
  resigned to take a chair of statistics at the University of Washington.
- |
  It was a pity to lose her from the Lab, but a greater pity to lose her
- |
  from the country. She had applied for chairs of statistics in the UK,
- |
  but committees with a narrow concept of statistics appointed candidates
- "clearly her inferior. \n"
- |2
   As argued earlier, books published by the staff do not
- |
  reflect everything, but they must reflect something. In 1986 Wiley
- |
  published Peter Whittle's Systems in Stochastic Equilibrium
- |
  and in 1987 the revision by Chris Rogers and David Williams of Vol. 2
- |
  of David's Diffusions, Markov Processes and Martingales.
- |
  To anticipate somewhat, in 1990 Wiley published Peter Whittle's Risk-sensitive
- |
  Optimal Control and in 1991 Cambridge University Press
- |
  brought out two sets of lecture notes based on existing Part II
- |
  courses. These were Communication Theory (Charles
- |
  Goldie and Richard Pinch) and Probability with Martingales
- "(David Williams). \n"
- |2
   A very significant and encouraging development was the
- |
  emergence in 1985 of the Stochastic Networks Group. Frank Kelly's
- |
  interest in queueing networks had developed, through a contact with
- |
  British Telecom which was later formalised, into an interest in
- |
  communication networks. Communication and computer specialists
- |
  worldwide were beginning to recognise that such systems generate
- |
  interesting and difficult stochastic problems, with optimisation (or at
- |
  least good performance) very much a consideration. Frank had attracted
- |
  some very good students to this field early in the decade (e.g. Iain
- |
  MacPhee and Ilze Ziedins). However, by the mid-eighties a very bright
- |
  and substantial group had been formed by the arrival of Richard
- |
  Gibbens, Graham Louth, Phil Hunt and Neil Laws; this was reinforced by
- |
  the development of a close working relationship with British Telecom.
- |
  The group now constituted itself the Stochastic Networks Group. It also
- |
  provided the first case in which the Lab had clearly achieved critical
- |
  mass on any research topic. Over the years a modest staff had been
- |
  trying to cover a wide field, with the result that real concentration
- |
  was reached on no single topic. The critical local density was now
- |
  achieved for the first time. Moreover, the group was answering an
- |
  advanced technological need at just the right time. The introduction of
- |
  electronic telephone exchanges means that, for example, new
- |
  call-routing methods are both possible and necessary. Frank Kelly and
- |
  Richard Gibbens evolved the Dynamic Alternative Routing scheme, which
- |
  provides near-optimal performance by simple means and has since been
- |
  put into practice by British Telecom. This is only an example of the
- |
  type of challenge large systems are offering. The Stochastic Networks
- |
  Group (and with it the Lab), although small enough in all conscience,
- |
  now has a high international reputation in the study of communications
- |
  networks. It is likely that an Institute of Telecommunications will be
- |
  founded in the University of Cambridge in the near future, supported by
- |
  industry, with the Stochastic Networks Group as one of its prime
- "components. \n"
- |2
   The impression created by the many references to the
- |
  Brunsviga should now be corrected; computing facilities in the Lab have
- |
  of course kept pace with the times. They are used as a teaching adjunct
- |
  only for the Diploma practical class and occasional other courses, such
- |
  as the multivariate analysis class. However, everybody computes, of
- |
  course, and reactionaries who do not have this basic skill are now so
- "rare as to be acquiring antiquity value. \n"
- |2
   The manual Brunsvigas continued in class use until at least
- |
  1947/8, although being progressively replaced by electromechanical
- |
  machines from about 1944. By 1964 the mainframe Titan was then also
- |
  available, using autocode and paper tape. Hewlett-Packard pocket
- |
  calculators were adopted in 1973, followed by programmable calculators
- |
  in the late seventies. Fortran was by now used for calculations on the
- |
  IBM mainframe. In 1983 the change was made to BBC micros, using a Torch
- |
  disc drive, BASIC, and with Glim available on disc. Statistical
- |
  packages also became available on the mainframe: SAD, BMDP, Genstat and
- |
  SPSS. Computing power in the Lab was greatly enhanced in 1987 by
- |
  Hewlett-Packard's donation of several Unix work-stations. It was the
- |
  manifest success of the Stochastic Networks Group which prompted
- |
  Hewlett-Packard to make this generous and much-appreciated gift. These
- |
  work-stations were linked; about this time the ethernet local area
- |
  network was installed throughout the Lab. Now, in 1993, the network is
- |
  being greatly enhanced, with the provision of X-windows and packages
- "such as Splus, Glim and Mathematica. \n"
- |2
   A refreshing interlude was provided in 1986/7 by David Banks,
- |
  who gave highly appreciated and capable relief teaching in statistics
- |
  for the year. David came from Berkeley and returned to Carnegie-Mellon,
- |
  and it was he who made us realise what a positive benefit such a
- |
  `casual' can be. In both classroom and commonroom David at once fitted
- |
  in and brought a breath of fresh air; we feel that he left us rather
- "than that he visited us. \n"
- |2
   There were various developments in 1987. One was David
- |
  Williams' resigned assumption of the Directorship. Another was the
- |
  Royal Statistical Society's celebration of its Charter Centenary by a
- |
  three-day meeting in Cambridge (more particularly, in the Cambridge
- |
  Union). The Lab provided local organisation, a task it carried out
- |
  willingly and enjoyed. Finally, there was a welcome accession of
- |
  strength on the statistical side with the appointment of Alastair Young
- |
  to a UALship. He and Henry Daniels cooperated on a mathematical
- "evaluation of the bootstrap method. \n"
- |2
   Peter Whittle was awarded an SERC Senior Fellowship for the
- |
  years 1988/91 to enable him to work on another variety of networks:
- |
  neural networks. The consequent necessity of finding a temporary
- |
  teaching replacement again provided a bonus. Charles Goldie was
- |
  appointed for a two-year period which was, reasonably enough, as much
- |
  absence as the University of Sussex would allow him. Charles proved
- |
  eager and capable in high degree. He took on the courses in convex
- |
  optimisation and communication theory, which were quite new to him,
- |
  with enthusiasm and thoroughness. An byproduct in the second case was
- "the CUP course text, already mentioned, written with Richard Pinch. \n"
- |2
   There was little expectation that one would find a third-year
- |
  replacement to match Charles, who had been the happiest solution in
- |
  every respect. However, Yurii Suhov, from Moscow, showed interest. He
- |
  had already visited the Lab and, with his background in statistical
- |
  communication theory among other things, seemed a very good bet,
- |
  although obviously in some respects an outside one. Visa trouble
- |
  delayed him in Dublin until late January 1991, which made him thrice
- |
  welcome when he came. He was appointed to a regular ULship later that
- |
  year. Yurii brings skill in the applications of probability to
- |
  statistical physics; also the well-known strengths of the mathematical
- "culture in which he was brought up. \n"
- |2
   In 1989 Frank Kelly was elected an FRS; a happy development
- |
  in itself, and one which brought the Lab's tally to five (Henry Daniels
- |
  and David Kendall being assuredly counted always as Lab members). This
- "was followed by his appointment to a personal chair. \n"
- |2
   Chris Rogers left in 1991 for a chair at Queen Mary and
- |
  Westfield College, London, joining Charles Goldie there. Chris had been
- |
  a great enthusiast for all stochastic analysis related to Brownian
- |
  motion. In recent years he had also developed an interest in
- |
  applications: to some part in statistical consultancy but to some part
- |
  also in financial modelling. The quite sophisticated mathematical
- |
  analysis of option-pricing and the like has engaged the attention of
- |
  many probabilists over recent years: in Cambridge, of Chris Rogers,
- |
  Doug Kennedy and David Williams. In 1993/4 it will find its way into a
- "Part II course. \n"
- |2
   Chris Rogers was replaced (although the correspondence
- |
  between resignations and appointments is inexact) by the appointment of
- |
  Gareth Roberts as a UAL in 1992. Gareth's background was originally in
- |
  probability, but he had moved much more into statistics while at
- "Nottingham with Adrian Smith. \n"
- |2
   In 1991 David Williams resigned from his chair,
- |
  characteristically giving for notice as much time as would be needed to
- |
  find his replacement. He had made earlier resignation attempts,
- |
  alleging his own inadequacy for the post, a charge so ludicrous that
- |
  words could scarcely be found to counter it. David Kendall and Peter
- |
  Whittle had baulked these by writing independently to the
- |
  Vice-Chancellor and asserting (sincerely and without collusion) that
- |
  David Williams was the best Director the Laboratory had ever had.
- |
  However, he was now resolved. His real reasons were perhaps the obvious
- |
  ones: a weariness with administration, a desire to get more of his own
- |
  work done, and hiraeth -- longing for Wales. However, strangely, and as
- |
  no one in Cambridge had realised, when David left Swansea in 1985 he
- |
  had announced to the Senate there that he intended to occupy the
- "Cambridge post for just seven years. \n"
- |2
   The fixity of David's decision was recognised, and Frank
- |
  Kelly took over the Directorship in 1991. The intention that David
- |
  should thus be spared worry in his last year at Cambridge was not in
- |
  fact fulfilled; the difficulties of house-moving had reached their
- |
  now-familiar intensity, and David suffered serious health problems. It
- |
  was with great regret that the Lab saw him depart in 1992; an era of
- |
  particular warmth and vitality had closed.
- |2

- |
  1992--:Regeneration
- |2+

- |
  David Williams had given the Electors good time in which to replace
- |
  him, and the same care was taken to prepare a good field as in 1985,
- |
  with the same genuine anxiety to do right by statistics. However, to
- |
  the outside observer the election also provided a re-run of history.
- |
  Several outstandingly strong probabilists had applied; the statistical
- |
  field was sound, but less outstanding, even if one measured each of the
- |
  two fields by the world standards of its own discipline. The
- |
  statisticians were certainly given a margin of preference; against this
- |
  one must perhaps reckon an anxiety that the existing strengths of the
- |
  Laboratory should not be gratuitously jeopardised.
- |2+

- |2
   The outcome was that Geoffrey Grimmett was elected; he left
- |
  Bristol and took up his post in October of 1992. Geoffrey had made a
- |
  very strong name in the study of percolation processes and of random
- |
  graphs, interests which abut those of several in the Lab and the
- "University. \n"
- |2
   The long-felt unease within the Laboratory itself that the
- |
  subject of statistics was inadequately represented was now supplemented
- |
  by a growing realisation that the regime in which the Lab's first chair
- |
  continued to be filled by a probabilist might be self-perpetuating, and
- |
  indeed that such a pattern might not even be unreasonable if the Lab's
- |
  existing strength in the central topic of probability was to be
- |
  preserved. Moves were then set afoot to establish a third chair, to be
- |
  called the Chair of Statistics or whichever variant would emphasise its
- |
  protected nature: that it should under no circumstances be filled by
- "any other than a genuine statistician. \n"
- |2
   The course of this last election reinforced the unease;
- |
  indeed, the conscience of some of the Electors was appeased only by the
- |
  undertaking from John Coates, now the Head of DPMMS, that the proposed
- |
  Chair of Statistics would be the top Faculty priority. This is no light
- |
  undertaking, but John, whose understanding and support for the Lab have
- |
  matched those of Ian Cassels, gave it unequivocally. It was further
- |
  decided that the search for suitable candidates for the new chair would
- |
  be undertaken much more deliberately and systematically than is the
- |
  Cambridge habit: that a Search Committee would be formed to actively
- |
  beat the world of statistics, and that the members of this committee
- |
  would ultimately form the nucleus of the Board of Electors. At the time
- |
  of writing the case for the establishment of the Chair has just been
- |
  accepted by the General Board of the University, and it is hoped that
- "the post will be filled by October 1994. \n"
- |2
   Despite the great widening of its interests, the Laboratory
- |
  remains the Statistical Laboratory and the Diploma remains the Diploma
- |
  in Mathematical Statistics. However inadequate these may now seem as
- |
  descriptions, the feeling has been that to change them would be like
- |
  trying to doctor one's foundation stone. It is believed on the other
- "hand that they constitute no false claim. \n"
- |2
   In particular, the term `Operational Research' has not crept
- |
  into either title. For reasons which would take too long to recount, OR
- |
  activity in the Lab has been even more divorced from the activity of
- |
  the `OR community' than has been the corresponding case in statistics.
- |
  Nevertheless, it is notable that the Lab has supplied the only winners
- |
  in the UK (and among the few in Europe) of the Lanchester Prize of the
- |
  Operational Research Society of America: Peter Whittle in 1987 and
- |
  Frank Kelly in 1992. Perhaps the term `operational research' is no
- |
  longer a fair description of what one is trying to do; something like
- "`the mathematics of systems' may be nearer. \n"
- |2
   The success of the Laboratory depends on all its staff and
- |
  the depth they supply; to measure the state of the Laboratory by the
- |
  state of its professorial staff would be invidious and misleading.
- |
  Nevertheless, the fact that the Statistical Laboratory has now
- |
  progressed to a professorial staff of four does underline the great
- |
  change in its circumstances since the fifties, and the composition of
- |
  this staff signals rejuvenescence and promise. Frank Kelly and Geoffrey
- |
  Grimmett are both young and of high international reputation. If, as
- |
  one may reasonably expect, they are matched by those soon to be elected
- |
  to the Churchill Chair and to the new Chair of Statistics, then,
- |
  whatever the Lab does in the coming years, it will lead.

   The hope that these notes would have some claim to serve as a
- |
  document of record has limited the character of the anecdotal material
- |
  that could be included; roughly, it could not be gratuitously hurtful

  and it had to have some point.  The following abbreviations are used in the less formal parts
- |
  of the text: Lab for Statistical Laboratory, UL for University

- |
  Statistics and DAMTP for the Department of Applied Mathematics and

  Theoretical Physics.  Some of the long-serving members of the computing staff

  figure in the article. The members of the secretarial staff have been
- |
  many and various; rough justice is perhaps best achieved by naming the
- |
  first and the last, both of whom have some special character. Beata
- |
  Reifenberg was the Lab Secretary in the St Andrew's Hill days. Wally
- |
  Smith says of her: ``I have seldom encountered an equal in all the days

  since then. Her great ambition was to be able to afford to buy all the

  Brandenburg concertos on long-play records''. Sarah Shea-Simonds has

  been Secretary since 1985; it is Sarah who stirred the Laboratory into
- |
  the actions, long contemplated but not hitherto undertaken, of
- |
  celebrating this anniversary and writing this history.  This 2001 revision of the text corrects some minor errors and
- |
  adds material which came in too late to be incorporated in the 1993
- |
  version; notably from Frank Anscombe, Norman Bailey, Colin Campbell,
- |
  Anthony Edwards, Charles Goldie, David McLaren and Ingram Olkin. These
- |
  additions still concern only the period up to 1993 (to the point of an
- |
  apparent obliviousness of staff changes made soon after); events after
- |
  that are left to some other chronicler. 2.
- |
  Prehistory There had been considerable activity in statistics in
- |
  Cambridge well before 1947, distinguished initially by some striking
- |
  individual figures and then by a quickening recognition of the subject
- |
  as a field in its own right. In coverage of the earliest phases we draw
- |
  largely (and briefly) on Edwards (1991).  Edwards regards statistics as beginning in Cambridge with
- |
  Augustus de Morgan (matriculated 1923), followed in that century by
- |
  R.L. Ellis (1836), J. Venn (1853), J.W.L. Glaisher (1867), all prime
- |
  names in any history of statistics or probability. F.J.M. Stratton
- |
  (1901) lectured on the Combination of Observations; Edwards' mention
- |
  that Fisher attended his lectures in 1911 gives a link with living
- |
  memory.  In 1912 a University Lectureship in Statistics was
- |
  established to which G. Udny Yule was appointed, working in the Faculty
- |
  of Agriculture. Yule was already the author of a very influential
- |
  textbook ( An Introduction to the Theory of Statistics,
- |
  Griffin, 1911), but is now remembered for his subsequent work in time
- |
  series analysis. He opened a new era in this subject by his proposal of
- |
  the autoregressive process. Yule retired in 1931, by then a Reader, but
- |
  remained an active figure. Maurice Bartlett mentions of his
- |
  postgraduate year (1932/3) that Yule ``was very much one of my mentors,
- |
  as he no doubt was of Maurice Kendall, who was a Cambridge student before
- |
  the Wishart era''  While the Statistical Laboratory has been the product of many
- |
  influences, it is in the School of Agriculture that one rightly sees
- |
  its genesis. Statistics has been fostered there as a tool and as a
- |
  discipline from the days of Professor T.B. Wood, Udny Yule was a
- |
  seminal and international figure and it was the interaction of the
- |
  School and the Faculty of Mathematics (through the mediation of John
- |
  Wishart, as we shall see) which produced both the Statistical
- |
  Laboratory and the Diploma. The School has continued its own vital
- |
  interest in the subject with the A.R.C. Statistics Group. The history
- |
  of these developments has been set out very thoroughly by Colin
- |
  Campbell (1959).  Harold Jeffreys came squarely on to the Cambridge academic
- |
  scene when he was appointed a College Lecturer (St. John's) in 1922,
- |
  this being converted to a University Lectureship in 1926. Jeffreys'
- |
  primary interest, which was geophysics, stimulated him to a strong
- |
  derived interest in inference. His books Scientific Inference
- |
  (Cambridge University Press, 1931; third edition 1975) and Theory
- |
  of Probability (Clarendon Press, 1939; third edition 1961)
- |
  established his reputation in that field, then and now. Jeffreys'
- |
  approach to inference (and by `probability' he often means statistical
- |
  inference; by `inverse probability' he always does) was explicitly
- |
  Bayesian, with maximum entropy criteria also clearly formulated, and so
- |
  still finds considerable resonance.  Yule was succeeded on retirement in 1931 by John Wishart,
- |
  arriving from Rothamsted. Wishart's Readership was primarily assigned
- |
  to the Faculty of Agriculture, but the terms of his post directed him
- |
  to give courses for mathematicians as well as for postgraduate students
- |
  in agriculture. Bartlett writes: ``as there was space allotted to
- |
  Wishart in the School of Agriculture, where practical classes in
- |
  statistics were given, my own inclination is always to think of a
- |
  `Statistical Laboratory' being in existence from Wishart's arrival in
- |
  Cambridge''.  Some idea of the activity at this time may be gained from
- |
  Edwards' observation that a student taking Part III of the Mathematical
- |
  Tripos in 1935/6 ``could hear Sir Arthur Eddington's `Combination of
- |
  Observations' in the Michaelmas Term, John Wishart's `Theory of
- |
  Statistics' in the Lent Term and Harold Jeffreys' `Probability' in the
- |
  Easter Term''. Indeed, in 1931/2 Maurice Bartlett took just these
- |
  courses, with the substitution of Fowler's `Statistical Mechanics' for
- |
  Jeffreys' course.  In these days of student appraisal of lecturers etc. it is
- |
  interesting to note how common it seemed to be then that even
- |
  interesting material or brilliant intellects were accompanied by
- |
  indifferent delivery. Some of us can take heart! Henry Daniels says of
- |
  Wishart that ``although the lectures themselves were not very well
- |
  given, the material was very interesting'' and of Eddington
- |
  ``intriguing, and a little bizarre in some respects''. David Finney
- |
  writes of Jeffreys that his ``personal charm and enthusiasm did not
- |
  prevent a steady decline in attendance''. Norman Bailey recalls
- |
  Jeffreys' lectures as being ``interesting but difficult, not least
- |
  because from time to time Jeffreys would become inarticulate, simply
- |
  waving his arms while his brain moved on. When he rearticulated some
- |
  minutes later in a perfectly lucid way it was apparent that we
- |
  had just missed what he had thought but had been unable to say in those
- |
  precious minutes''.  One might also note the number of people, later to become
- |
  prominent statisticians, who passed through Cambridge before
- |
  the foundation of the Statistical Laboratory: e.g. Yates, Bartlett,
- |
  Finney, Maurice Kendall, Daniels, Cochran, Barnard, Cedric Smith and
- |
  Armitage.  Wishart was all the time endeavouring to promote the subject
- |
  of statistics, and in fact to develop a programme in mathematical
- |
  statistics. In this he was not positively helped by the presence in
- |
  Cambridge of the two luminaries of the subject: Jeffreys and Fisher
- |
  (who had been appointed Professor of Genetics in 1943). These two were
- |
  of course accorded the respect of the Faculty of Mathematics, which
- |
  Wishart (based in Agriculture) was not, and Wishart had the ambition of
- |
  creating a working unit in statistics, which they did not. A lofty word
- |
  from either of them could have a withering effect.  However, the Faculty of Mathematics evidently felt the need
- |
  for some in-house strength in statistics, and in June 1938 advertised a
- |
  University Lecturership for which special consideration was to be given
- |
  ``to candidates with qualifications in the Theory of Statistics''.
- |
  Maurice Bartlett was appointed. With a break for war-work he held the
- |
  post until 1947. He lectured first largely in statistical theory, a
- |
  subject which was still evolving to the shape we would recognise today.
- |
  Bartlett combined ideas which were in general circulation with his own
- |
  statistical research (never recognised at its full pioneering worth).
- |
  Frank Anscombe took notes of this course which Henry Daniels later
- |
  read, to realise that ``Bartlett's approach to the subject was one that
- |
  I sympathised with very much''. Violet Cane attended Maurice's
- |
  statistics course in 1939/40; she recalls finding it difficult at the
- |
  time, but realised later that she had (and still has!) a beautiful set
- |
  of notes. Development of ideas was then the consideration, rather than
- |
  rigour, so, when Dennis Lindley asked Bartlett to prove consistency of
- |
  the maximum likelihood estimate in class in 1946, this was a little
- |
  cruel, as he himself admits. It was to be yet a while before a good
- |
  proof was found by Wald (and, actually, by Lindley also).  Maurice Bartlett is of course specially noted for his early
- |
  and fundamental contributions to the theory of stochastic processes,
- |
  but it is first after his return from war work that he seems to have
- |
  given a course on the subject , whose reach had still not been defined
- |
  by a text. Bartlett's own text was one of the very first. The course
- |
  included stationary time series and diffusion processes as special
- |
  topics. Norman Bailey attended it in 1946/7. He had trouble with time
- |
  series component, ``but the evolutionary process component was nothing
- |
  short of inspiring and had considerable importance for a lot of my
- |
  later applied research". Wishart was also absent on national service
- |
  during the war years, when
- |
  his lectures were given by Dr J.O Irwin. Also, for at least one of
- |
  those years, mathematics undergraduates were required to come up during
- |
  the summer vacation to study electronics. Norman Bailey recalls
- |
  enjoying the electronics much more than the statistics. Jeffreys also
- |
  later gave a short course in statistics, reputedly to Wishart's
- |
  annoyance.
- |2
   Maurice Bartlett has kept copies of a three-way
- |
  correspondence in 1943 between himself, Wishart and F.P. White, then
- |
  Secretary of the Faculty Board of Mathematics. The former two were both
- |
  away on national service; Bartlett writes from the Projectile
- |
  Development Establishment in Aberporth and Wishart from the Civil
- |
  Establishments Branch, Admiralty, Whitehall. White had written to all
- |
  teachers of Mathematics in the University, including those on national
- |
  service, asking for their views on the pattern to be envisaged for the
- |
  Faculty and its activities after the war. The Faculty still had no
- |
  collective physical accommodation, and had reported immediately before
- |
  the war that its most urgent need was ``the foundation of an Institute
- |
  of Mathematics in close proximity to the Mathematical Laboratory and
- |
  the Philosophical Library''.  Wishart was of course concerned with the position of
- |
  Statistics; he plainly wished to escape from Agriculture, whose
- |
  interest in Statistics he considered too narrow, and very much wished
- |
  to be associated with the projected Institute. On the other hand, he
- |
  considered that Statistics should occupy a central position relative to
- |
  a number of Faculties, and sketched a case for the establishment of a
- |
  separate Faculty of Statistics. He nevertheless obviously regarded the
- |
  Faculty of Mathematics as the best single peg on which to cling
- |
  immediately: ``Returning to the question of the Institute, an `embryo'
- |
  school of Statistics should certainly be housed therein''. He wished
- |
  such a school to be open to members of any Faculty, but that its
- |
  fundamental basis should be mathematical.  Bartlett, already a member of the Faculty of Mathematics, was
- |
  more concerned with the provision of advanced courses. This meant Part
- |
  III courses; the Diploma was not yet envisaged. He was particularly
- |
  concerned to gain coverage for statistical (in fact, probabilistic)
- |
  thinking in physical contexts, and for a new course on the `theory of
- |
  stochastic processes', a topic then more familiar to some under the
- |
  names of `random functions' or `time series'.  The demand for trained statisticians revealed during the war
- |
  was such that in 1946 a second University Lectureship was advertised,
- |
  to which Henry Daniels was appointed. Wishart could now see his
- |
  long-nursed ambition of a Diploma in Statistics approaching
- |
  realisation. There were discussions about the content of the proposed
- |
  Diploma. Maurice Bartlett recalls a degree of irritation when, during
- |
  his convalescence after an appendectomy in 1946, he was ``visited by
- |
  Wishart in the nursing-home to discuss the final draft Diploma
- |
  regulations. These included the requirement to take a `field of
- |
  application', which was facilitated by the link with agriculture and
- |
  with genetics, following the appointment of Fisher during the war to
- |
  the genetics chair''. Bartlett himself missed out on the actual
- |
  foundation; in 1947 he left to become the first Professor of
- |
  Mathematical Statistics at Manchester. He was replaced in Cambridge
- |
  late that year by Frank Anscombe, from Rothamsted, who took up the post
- |
  in January, 1948.3.
- |
  1947--55 Creation and
- |
  confirmation In 1947 the Faculty of Mathematics submitted a report to the
- |
  General Board proposing the establishment of a Diploma in Statistics
- |
  and a Statistical Laboratory, the former to be awarded to
- |
  mathematicians who had attended a course and been examined in
- |
  theoretical and applied statistics, and the latter ``to provide
- |
  primarily for the applied work in Statistics for students of this and
- |
  possibly of other Faculties, including Diploma and Research Students''.
- |2
   This was considered by the General Board in a Report dated
- |
  14th May 1947 ( Reporter , 1946-47, p. 1058),
- |
  which indeed recommended the institution of a Diploma in Mathematical
- |
  Statistics. The qualification `Mathematical' had been inserted to quell
- |
  the concerns of some other Faculty Boards that the statement in the
- |
  Diploma document that the candidate had displayed a special knowledge
- |
  of Statistics and of its application in a certain field might be taken
- |
  to imply that he was an expert in that field. Wishart's lifelong
- |
  enthusiasm for the teaching of statistics was now
- |
  being rewarded, and his dreams of a properly-established unit being
- |
  fulfilled. At a Royal Statistical Society discussion meeting on the
- |
  Teaching of Statistics which he opened he was able to report with pride
- |
  that ``it is now possible for a mathematical graduate at the University
- |
  of Cambridge to take a one-year Diploma in Statistics, during which
- |
  time he will be attached to a department where practical work is done,
- |
  and will be examined finally on his work in the chosen field of
- |
  application'' ( J. Roy. Statist. Soc. A
- |
  (1948) 111 , p. 227). This relates to an
- |
  interesting theme which emerges repeatedly in the discussion: the need
- |
  revealed during the war for statisticians with both practical and
- |
  mathematical competence.
- |2
   Fisher commented on these developments with his usual blend
- |
  of soundness and tetchiness; Edwards quotes passages from his
- |
  daughter's biography of him (Box, 1978). Fisher's own words at the end
- |
  are from a letter to Wishart in which he agrees to serve on a small
- |
  advisory Committee for the Diploma.  In 1950 the University did indeed amend the regulations for
- |
  the Diploma so that candidates without adequate mathematical
- |
  preparation could be required to take two years over the course.
- |
  Developments in the world of statistics over following years doubtless
- |
  reinforced Fisher in his apprehensions. However, the Cambridge Diploma
- |
  has remained true to its initial conception: that the theoretical
- |
  grounding should be accompanied by close acquaintance with an applied
- |
  field and a testing investigation of data from that field.  The General Board report quoted above passed over the
- |
  question of the foundation of the Statistical Laboratory as an
- |
  institution, but nevertheless discussed the provision of accommodation
- |
  for the Laboratory. Whether this was deliberate is unclear. The
- |
  Buildings Syndicate had already indicated its conditional preparedness
- |
  to ``recommend the assignment of a vacant site in Corn Exchange Street
- |
  for a temporary hut'' ( Reporter , 1946--47, p.
- |
  1296). So, the Statistical Laboratory existed to the considerable
- |
  extent that it was to have its own building, erected to its own
- |
  specifications submitted through the Faculty Board of Mathematics. More
- |
  than that, eloquent and conclusive, the structure when completed
- |
  carried a sign: `Statistical Laboratory'. The building was indeed a
- |
  `hut': brick, single-storey, 70 feet by 24, with six working rooms, one
- |
  of these being a larger `students' room' which served also for
- |
  seminars. It faced on to St Andrew's Hill, a lane off Corn Exchange
- |
  Street which has since been obliterated by the Lion Yard car park.  Dennis Lindley's recollection of the plan of the building and
- |
  its eventual occupancy is sketched below. Dennis's impression is that
- |
  David Cox used whatever room happened to be spare, although this
- |
  presumably did not continue. He mentions also that Wishart's original
- |
  plans made no allowances for lavatories. We see them here beside the
- |
  boiler, of which more anon.   For the session 1947/8 accommodation had perforce to be found
- |
  in the School of Agriculture, classes being held there and in the Arts
- |
  School. Frank Anscombe recalls Henry Daniels demonstrating his Bicycle
- |
  Theory (a counterintuitive steering theory) outside the School of
- |
  Agriculture building, so remembered with affection. However, in 1948
- |
  the staff (namely: Wishart, Daniels and Anscombe, with two computing
- |
  assistants: Donald East and Ena Laurie) moved to St Andrew's Hill.
- |
  Wishart seems to have shifted from his quarters of 16 years in the
- |
  School of Agriculture without hesitation. Bartlett comments: ``Wishart
- |
  was always keen to `push' statistics, and I don't know whether this
- |
  contributed to his falling-out in due course with Engledow, then
- |
  Director of the School of Agriculture, and that in turn to the creation
- |
  of the Laboratory''. However, that the School of Agriculture had indeed
- |
  been helpful is indicated by an acknowledgement in the report from the
- |
  Faculty Board of Mathematics: ``In the past, a number of graduates in
- |
  Mathematics were encouraged to spend a fourth year in research and in
- |
  equipping themselves as practising statisticians; the Board have been
- |
  indebted to the Department of Agriculture for equipping a small
- |
  laboratory which provided the necessary facilities''. Such an origin
- |
  certainly made it natural to carry over the title `statistical
- |
  laboratory' which, while accepted at University College London as given
- |
  by Galton, sat rather less naturally in a Faculty of Mathematics.  In any case, John Wishart's `pushing' was to good effect.
- |
  Dennis Lindley was appointed in 1948 to a Demonstratorship and David
- |
  Cox in 1950 to an Assistant Lectureship. David Cox was well known to
- |
  Henry Daniels; the two had worked together at the Wool Industries
- |
  Research Association -- one of those pragmatic institutions whose mark
- |
  its sometime members happily bear for life (see Daniels and Whittle,
- |
  1993).  Ingram Olkin mentions, interestingly, that many of the
- |
  significant departments of statistics in the USA were founded about
- |
  this time: Columbia and North Carolina in 1946, Stanford in 1948,
- |
  Berkeley and Chicago around 1952 and Iowa State somewhat earlier.
- |
  Wishart set the content and tone of the teaching for the first term of
- |
  the Diploma; Violet Cane recalls feeling distinctly depressed and ready
- |
  to quit. However, matters changed greatly for the better after
- |
  Christmas, when Henry Daniels took over courses, and even more so after
- |
  Easter (1948), when Frank Anscombe joined. Relief seems to have been
- |
  general; Norman Bailey writes that ``the General Mathematical
- |
  Statistics course was given by Henry Daniels most brilliantly, as
- |
  evinced by the resounding ovation he received at the end''. Norman
- |
  testifies to the meatiness of the course, as does John Nelder (Diploma
- |
  1948/9). Design of Experiments was done thoroughly in those days. Frank
- |
  Anscombe gave the course in John's year; he dragged the class through
- |
  Galois fields in lectures and then asked candidates to design a
- |
  rotation experiment in the practical exam.
- |2
   Henry Daniels has preserved his class lists from that time.
- |
  From his Stats II course for 1947/8 we can identify the members of the
- |
  first Diploma year and recognise many of them: N.T.J. Bailey, V.R.
- |
  Cane, J. Durbin, G.S. James, S.F. James, F.H.C. Marriott, P. Robinson,
- |
  D.C. Shaw, N.J. Wang and L. Whitehouse. There are other familiar names
- |
  on the list; e.g. J.M. Hammersley, J.A. Nelder and E.S. Page from Part
- |
  II of the Tripos, J.E. Drummond and J.C. Tanner from Part III and R.M.
- |
  Williams, a research student. C.R. Rao was also in Cambridge that year;
- |
  as a research student with Fisher, but attending the Lab seminars.  Dennis Lindley recalls some of the early Diploma examinations
- |
  as being so difficult (in an attempt to impress the mathematicians with
- |
  the respectability of the subject) that they stumped staff as well as
- |
  students, laying a supervision minefield for years to come. However,
- |
  Jim Durbin emphasises that, for the 1947/8 Diploma, the real problem,
- |
  at least for him, was ``the seven-hour practical exam
- |
  . We had 10 students in a small room grinding away for dear life on
- |
  Brunsviga manually-driven calculators all day long. The noise was
- |
  horrific and I found it so hard to concentrate I thought I'd probably
- |
  made a hash of it and hence, since Wishart was always going on about
- |
  the practical exam being the most important part of the whole affair,
- |
  had failed the Diploma. Fortunately, forbearance triumphed and I got a
- |
  Distinction''.  Both Henry and Violet speak of the particular vividness and
- |
  exhilaration of the immediate post-war years, as people streamed back
- |
  from war-work to resume their studies. This cohort represented a store
- |
  of banked-up talent; individuals who valued the prospects that peace
- |
  opened and met them with minds at once mature and fresh. One such was
- |
  Robin Williams, who had been working on electromagnetic separation
- |
  processes for the Manhattan Project, and who, despite encouragement to
- |
  stay, chose rather to start research in statistics in Cambridge from
- |
  1947. He was disappointed to find that his prospective supervisor,
- |
  Bartlett, had moved, to be replaced by Wishart. An appeal to Daniels
- |
  resulted in his being passed on to Frank Anscombe for what turned out
- |
  to be a rewarding collaboration (on the optimisation of experimental
- |
  lay-out in the presence of spatial autocorrelation between plots).
- |
  Robin recalls Anscombe and Daniels with warmth.  Other research students from this time were Dennis Evans,
- |
  Andrew Ehrenberg (both 1949/52), Wally Smith (1950/3) and Ewan Page
- |
  (1951/4). Wally very nearly missed the return to graduate work in
- |
  Cambridge. He had just served three years in the Royal Navy and had now
- |
  arranged study, grant and marriage. However, with the advent of the
- |
  Korean War, all releases were cancelled. Wally was appalled at the
- |
  prospect of the collapse of his plans and urgently required a ``letter
- |
  that would convince the admirals that I would be serving the nation
- |
  much better studying Statistics than drowning in the China Sea'' -
- |
  Wally could not swim. He found it difficult to convince anybody in
- |
  Cambridge of the urgency of his case, but at last wrung a missive from
- |
  his supervisor-to-be, Henry Daniels, which, reinforced by support from
- |
  Dr Stoneley of Pembroke, did the trick.  Wally recalls the Stats Lab as he knew it: housed in the St
- |
  Andrew's Hill hut. A cosy place, tiny offices, and a library whose
- |
  excellence he attributes to Lindley. The room containing the gas
- |
  furnace was off limits, with apparent good reason, as ``every week or
- |
  two a considerable explosion would erupt''. The furnace was in the care
- |
  of ``Donald East, who seemed, on first encounter, to be a little
- |
  distant and saturnine, but, on further acquaintance, proved to be
- |
  amiable and helpful, and very competent at his work (except, perhaps,
- |
  for those occasional lapses in the furnace room: once the detonation he
- |
  produced while making `necessary adjustments' caused a bang of many
- |
  decibels, and I do believe the doors rattled, while he came out
- |
  backwards from the furnace room at high velocity)''.  Something has been said of lecturing styles; Wally's
- |
  pen-pictures are too good not to reproduce in full. Wally refers to Dennis Lindley and David Cox repeatedly with
- |
  unreserved gratitude and respect. David made ``everything he discussed
- |
  seem so very very easy and straightforward. One kicked oneself at being
- |
  so stupid as to need any instruction at all on such a seemingly trivial
- |
  matter.'' Dennis's purple hectographed notes on the Kolmogorov
- |
  treatment of probability summarised ``the most important for me of all
- |
  the lectures I ever attended as a graduate student''.  Wally entered research with some travail. ``Henry sent me
- |
  over the road to the Zoology lab to work with a research man called
- |
  J.W.S. Pringle who was obtaining an abundance of photographic records
- |
  of the nerve response of giant South American cockroaches. He would pin
- |
  (literally) the poor but unphotogenic creature to a large block of wax,
- |
  plunge an electrode somewhere into its brain, and then tickle its leg
- |
  with a camel-hair brush...I had little knowledge of the chemistry of
- |
  nerve transmission and so on. Thus the months in which I should have
- |
  been mastering measure theory and semi-groups and Fourier analysis and
- |
  all those other good worthwhile things, I was floundering around trying
- |
  to teach myself the rudiments of subjects I found very unattractive.''  Before Wally managed to obtain relief from the cockroach Ewan
- |
  Page introduced him to EDSAC, of which both were then early users.
- |
  Relief came via Dennis Lindley, who was then in the middle of his
- |
  classic work on queues. Wally was fascinated by the Wiener-Hopf
- |
  arguments. When Henry took a sabbatical in Chicago in 1952 Wally was
- |
  reassigned to David Cox, ``the two years of work on cockroaches went
- |
  out the window'' and Fourier ideas, Wiener-Hopf theory and renewal
- |
  processes came in. Ewan Page was supervised by Frank Anscombe, of whom
- |
  he speaks with the
- |
  same warmth as does Robin Williams. `Inspirational' he says, with the
- |
  capacity to `let his mind wander' as they discussed problems. When
- |
  Frank took sabbatical leave in Princeton 1953/4 Ewan was taken over by
- |
  David Cox, who warned him: ``I don't have many ideas; I hope you don't
- |
  want me to give you an idea!''.
- |2
   Wally and Ewan together wrote a pools forecasting guide one
- |
  weekend, which they tried to publish, without success. However, Ewan
- |
  scored one of the historic triumphs of the Lab the following year
- |
  (1953) when, using random numbers from the Fisher and Yates statistical
- |
  tables, he won a First Division treble chance. According to a
- |
  financially-straitened Wally, ``enough in those days to buy a modest
- |
  house and a modest new car (if one chose)''.  Ewan tells how he was in Dennis Lindley's room one day,
- |
  discussing a change-point problem on the board, when Wishart brought in
- |
  A.C. Aitken. Aitken was of course famed for his feats of memory, and,
- |
  some considerable time later at a seminar in Edinburgh, Ewan challenged
- |
  him to recall what had been on the board that day. Aitken obliged.  Courses were of course given for the Mathematical Tripos as
- |
  well as for the Diploma. Anscombe started and Lindley then developed
- |
  the first Part II course in probability. It had to be entitled `Random
- |
  variables', however -- Jeffreys objected to use of the term
- |
  `Probability', which he reserved to describe his own brand of Bayesian
- |
  inference.  In 1953 the reality of the Laboratory became formally
- |
  recognised. Regulations for the Statistical Laboratory, which covered
- |
  also the post of Director, were proposed by the Faculty Board of
- |
  Mathematics in October 1952 ( Reporter, 1952-53,
- |
  p. 810) and approved by the University on 21st March, 1953. In April
- |
  1953 J. Wishart, still a Reader in Statistics with primary appointment
- |
  in the Faculty of Agriculture, was appointed Director.  Colleagues from that period give Wishart credit for the
- |
  single-mindedness which at last brought the Diploma and the Laboratory
- |
  to being. They give him less credit for sensitivity and tact. He would
- |
  introduce a member of the Lab staff to a visitor as ``My assistant'' -
- |
  save in the case of David Cox. Youth still rested so clearly on David
- |
  that he was more appropriately introduced as ``My student''.  All unknowing, the Statistical Laboratory was now at a zenith
- |
  it would not hold for long and would not reach again for many years -
- |
  some would say `never', in that the character of those times will not
- |
  recur. It was fully set up, with a staff consisting of a Reader
- |
  (Wishart), three University Lecturers (Anscombe and Daniels with a
- |
  recently-promoted Lindley) and one Assistant Lecturer (Cox) plus
- |
  computing staff. It set the pattern and the standard for departments of
- |
  statistics throughout the country. In particular, one can say that the
- |
  Diploma was the model for all the postgraduate courses in statistics
- |
  which have been set up since. The Diploma itself was thriving, and its
- |
  products occupied many of the key statistical posts in the country,
- |
  university posts among them. The staff were leading in research in
- |
  their respective fields: Daniels in stochastic processes,
- |
  position-finding, steepest descents and components of variance,
- |
  Anscombe in the design of experiments and sequential analysis, Lindley
- |
  in inference and decision theory, and Cox in the design of experiments,
- |
  sequential estimation, renewal theory and point processes. Wally Smith
- |
  was just completing his Ph.D. in a late rush: he had developed insights
- |
  into the analytic theory of renewal processes and the like. He and
- |
  David Cox went on to collaborate fruitfully.  All the staff were heavily engaged in consultation for other
- |
  University departments, regarded as one of the prime functions of the
- |
  Lab. Lindley recalls: ``In common with other members of the Lab I did
- |
  some applied work, almost essential in order to provide facilities for
- |
  the Diploma candidates. The one I enjoyed most was for Rothschild on
- |
  the movement of sperm, giving a process that was not Markov of any
- |
  order''. The Lab also had close relations with the statisticians placed
- |
  in other departments, e.g. Norman Bailey in Medicine, Violet Cane in
- |
  Psychology, and Colin Campbell in Agriculture. Norman Bailey held a
- |
  post as Statistician to the Cambridge Medical School 1948/52; he was
- |
  succeeded first by Wally Smith and then by Bob Carpenter. He speaks
- |
  feelingly of the extent to which these lone statisticians relied on the
- |
  Statistical Laboratory for back-up and advice when in need. He also
- |
  wonders whether this increasing dispersion of applied statistics over
- |
  other departments may not, in the course of time, have had some
- |
  consequences for the central focus.  The Faculty recognised the function of the Statistical
- |
  Laboratory, in that so many mathematics graduates found employment in
- |
  statistics, and doubtless recognised the Lab's worth, in that it
- |
  considered its statisticians better than other peoples' statisticians.
- |
  Recognition of the quality of the subject as such was slow to come,
- |
  however, and it was a source of chagrin, particularly to senior members
- |
  of the Laboratory, that their status and function were not acknowledged
- |
  by the offer of a college fellowship. Indeed, no statistician was a
- |
  college fellow at that time; not even Wishart, who had been a Reader
- |
  for 22 years.  On the other hand, the `problem of the non-fellows' was by no
- |
  means particular to the statisticians. The Bridges Report (Reporter
- |
  13/3/1962, p.1075) found that in 1961 only some 500-odd out of 950
- |
  University Teaching Officers and equivalent held fellowships.  William Jackson Hall spent the year 1953/4 in the Lab as a
- |
  Fulbright Scholar, working on his dissertation for the University of
- |
  North Carolina. He remembers particularly Dennis Lindley's good
- |
  research advice, the clouds of pipe-smoke which Henry Daniels generated
- |
  in seminars and, of course, Ewan Page's pools win.  Robert Curnow took the Diploma in 1954/5, the same year as
- |
  Maurice Priestley and Mervyn Stone. The Brunsviga lives in his memory,
- |
  too, as does the occasion when David Cox became vexed by the time the
- |
  class took to invert a 7 ? 7 matrix on it. He also recalls Wishart's
- |
  course on distributions, which stopped at the exciting part: evaluation
- |
  of the fourth moment of the fifth cumulant. Ewan Page likewise shudders
- |
  at the memory of the `acres' of pattern coefficient calculations
- |
  required for these evaluations.  An innovation accompanying the change in status in 1953 was
- |
  the annual photograph of current Laboratory members: staff, computing
- |
  and secretarial staff, research and Diploma students. The rows of these
- |
  photographs on the Laboratory walls fascinate all who call. They
- |
  provide quite the quickest way of determining who was in the Lab when,
- |
  but also constitute an invaluable and evocative historical record. They
- |
  manifest something which has been evident from those days: a sense of
- |
  Laboratory identity and character, an esprit de corps which has
- |
  persisted through weal and woe.4.
- |
  1955--61 Disaster and diaspora In 1955 the Laboratory suffered a serious setback when David
- |
  Cox's appointment was not renewed. A University Assistant Lectureship
- |
  was a purely probationary appointment; for three years in the first
- |
  instance, extendable at most to five. It was in fact merely a stage in
- |
  an open competition for one of the restricted number of lectureships; a
- |
  competition in which the statisticians felt that they carried a
- |
  handicap, especially relative to the pure mathematicians. In this case
- |
  the post indeed went to a pure mathematician.  Nevertheless, David Cox was then regarded by the statistical
- |
  world as being of exceptional quality; a view which he has since
- |
  confirmed by becoming the leading figure in British statistics in his
- |
  generation, powerfully bridging probability models, theoretical and
- |
  applied statistics, and repeatedly honoured overseas. That the Faculty
- |
  should not recognise this seemed unjust and inexplicable; an affront to
- |
  both him and the subject. David himself has put the matter behind him;
- |
  it is others who still feel outrage. Norman Bailey writes: ``Feelings
- |
  were very strong, both amongst members of the Statistical Laboratory
- |
  itself and peripheral statisticians in other University departments,
- |
  that the growing and indeed talented mathematical statistical nucleus
- |
  was not being properly recognised, and that this was compounded by no
- |
  offer of college fellowships. I believe that this led to an inevitable
- |
  diaspora in the years up to around 1957.''  The loss of the youngest staff member was then followed, in a
- |
  most curious way, by the loss of the oldest. In 1956 John Wishart was
- |
  in Mexico, on leave. In July news came through that he had drowned
- |
  while bathing in the sea off Acapulco.  Such events are not only tragic in themselves; they are
- |
  sudden and shattering. Henry Daniels, deputising for Wishart during the
- |
  latter's leave, had now to wind up Wishart's affairs and take charge of
- |
  the Lab as Acting Director. Frank Anscombe left shortly after for a
- |
  post at Princeton, moving later to Yale. In the following year, 1957,
- |
  Henry Daniels himself left to take up the Chair of Mathematical
- |
  Statistics at Birmingham.  Of the five 1955 members of the academic staff of the Lab
- |
  only one then remained in October, 1957: Dennis Lindley. On him fell
- |
  the task of reviving the fortunes of the Lab; he was appointed
- |
  Director. The staff situation had been somewhat shored up, in that
- |
  Wally Smith had been appointed to a ULship in 1956, replacing Frank
- |
  Anscombe. However, he could return to the UK first at the beginning of
- |
  1957. Wally had been rather unsettled (a `yo-yo', says Ewan Page) since
- |
  completing his Ph.D. He had held the post in the Medical School at
- |
  Fenner's 1953/4. Earlier meetings with American visitors to Cambridge
- |
  (Sam Wilks, Harold Hotelling, Leo Goodman, Jimmy Savage) had opened his
- |
  eyes. Far from showing the brashness believed to be the American
- |
  characteristic, they exemplified ``the acme of gentlemanly courtesy''
- |
  and a ``quiet respectfulness'' not to be found in the RSS Research
- |
  Section meetings, for example. So, when offered an attractive post at
- |
  Chapel Hill in 1954, he had taken it, although only after three months'
- |
  indecision and then with many a backward glance to the UK. Ewan Page
- |
  recalls his plaint: ``Don't forget me so quickly!''. In 1956 he took
- |
  the chance to return to a full Lectureship in Cambridge.  After Henry's departure in the summer of 1957 only Dennis and
- |
  Wally were left to carry the full burden of the Lab's teaching and
- |
  activity. Every moment of day and evening was committed; a desperate
- |
  time, although Wally also recalls it as exhilarating. However, Wally
- |
  was dispirited by what Neyman had characterised as the `second-class
- |
  citizen' status of the statisticians in Cambridge, and found the social
- |
  life cold or absent compared with the friendliness and informality of
- |
  Chapel Hill. What must have been a difficult decision and a time of
- |
  deep disillusion is only hinted at in Dennis Lindley's brief
- |
  recollection: ``Wally and Mary paid a visit to our house on the day the
- |
  Russians launched the first Sputnik. Neyman and Elizabeth Scott were
- |
  also there. They had to cycle out to our house in the rain. They
- |
  decided a car in sunny Chapel Hill was better and left soon after.''
- |
  They left in summer, 1958, in fact, although often to return in body,
- |
  and perhaps more often in spirit. Wally never found it easy; his lament
- |
  for the days that had passed should be quoted in full. Dennis had a desperate task to keep the Lab going, although
- |
  he took it evenly enough. There were two immediate recruitments; Morris
- |
  Walker took up a University Lectureship in early 1958 (replacing Henry
- |
  Daniels) and Peter Whittle in late 1959 (replacing Wally Smith).
- |
  Whittle had no previous Cambridge connection at all, and Lindley had to
- |
  press the Faculty hard to secure the appointment, even resorting to the
- |
  then unheard-of extravagance of telephoning New Zealand. In his turn,
- |
  it took Whittle time to become aware of the cross-currents created by
- |
  events, realised and incipient. Some closer personal impressions of
- |
  these and later years at the Laboratory are given in Whittle (1994).  The Laboratory left St Andrew's Hill in 1958. Thanks to some
- |
  uncharacteristic maladroitness of the chemists it was given quarters in
- |
  the basement of the new Chemistry Building in Lensfield Road. Parquet
- |
  floors and lofty ceilings provided a degree of state unimaginable, at
- |
  any time, to the Faculty of Mathematics.  As mentioned, L.J. Savage had already visited Cambridge, in
- |
  1952. Dennis Lindley developed a closer contact with him while on
- |
  sabbatical in Chicago in 1954, and became impressed by his ideas in a
- |
  fashion which was to prove lasting. Savage again visited Cambridge for
- |
  the summer of 1958 and briefly in 1959.  Despite the reduction in its fortunes, the Lab still had a
- |
  wonderful feeling of camaraderie - perhaps because staff and graduate
- |
  students were so close in age. The names of the research students from
- |
  that time are now familiar: Ann Mitchell, John Bather, John Kingman,
- |
  Bob Loynes, Roger Miles, and Hilton Miller. Mervyn Stone had just
- |
  completed. Staff and students seemed always to be adjourning to the
- |
  Spread Eagle together to celebrate the augmentation of someone's
- |
  family.  Donald East was the principal member of the computing staff,
- |
  surviving from the days in Agriculture, when he had acted virtually as
- |
  Wishart's secretary. He used an electromechanical Marchant, Dennis
- |
  Lindley a Facit. The Diploma students at that time were still using the
- |
  manual Brunsvigas of which Jim Durbin spoke; now museum pieces which
- |
  have unfortunately been disposed of. (However, Violet Cane possesses
- |
  one, and Jeffreys' machines are displayed in DAMTP.)  Dennis Lindley left to take up a new chair at Aberystwyth in
- |
  1960. Donald East went too, changing his hobby from gardening to golf.
- |
  This was the first chair in statistics which had been created in the UK
- |
  for several years and there was little reason to expect that it would
- |
  be followed at all soon by others. Dennis also found the Aberystwyth
- |
  prospect attractive. In fact, the expansion of the sixties was about to
- |
  balloon, and there was a quickening even in Cambridge. The possible
- |
  establishment of a chair of statistics, mooted already in 1953, was now
- |
  being discussed more definitely in the Faculty, and colleges were
- |
  beginning to make cautious overtures to Laboratory staff.  The disintegration of the `Wishart' Laboratory should perhaps
- |
  not be seen as a disaster, but as the natural fruiting of success. The
- |
  Laboratory had reached a stage of maturity; that its members should be
- |
  dispersed over other universities was very likely for the general good.
- |
  The event itself that triggered that dispersal was, of course, tragic.  Lindley, the last of the old guard, had a considerable
- |
  influence - broadening, innovatory and lasting - on the activity of the
- |
  Laboratory. The contribution he then made to queueing theory is a
- |
  classic of applied probability, which to this day generates new work.
- |
  His Bayesian enthusiasms are associated with his championing of the
- |
  ideas of L.J. Savage and B. de Finetti, but they also led him to
- |
  decision theory and some of the classic decision problems. This latter
- |
  interest may be seen as the germ of some of the courses in `applicable
- |
  mathematics' which were later to develop. A point of interest: Dennis's
- |
  undergraduate supervisor had been Besicovitch, himself a student of
- |
  Markov, so Dennis could claim Markov as his academic grandsire.  Violet Cane was appointed UL in 1960 to replace Dennis.
- |
  However, Peter Whittle left the next year to succeed Maurice Bartlett
- |
  in the Chair of Mathematical Statistics at Manchester. The Lab
- |
  photograph for 1961/2 is graphic: the total group is now reduced to a
- |
  handful. Morris Walker, taking his turn as Acting Director, peers
- |
  anxiously into the future.  Indeed, the future of the Statistical Laboratory had been
- |
  under consideration for some time; deliberations whose murmur seemed,
- |
  however, not to reach the Lab itself. 5.
- |
  1961--66 The Chair of Mathematical Statistics; Resurgence The buffets which the Laboratory had suffered since 1956 had
- |
  brought the Faculty to the realisation that its teaching of statistics
- |
  could be stabilised only by the creation of a senior post in the
- |
  Faculty: a Chair of Statistics. Outside Cambridge, the absence of such
- |
  a chair was regarded as frankly anomalous.  The future form envisaged for the Laboratory was bound up
- |
  with the structure of the Faculty itself, which was at that time
- |
  preparing to divide into the two existing departments. A 1958 Report of
- |
  the Faculty Board to the General Board ( Reporter,
- |
  1958--9, p. 1375) proposed the establishment of a Department of
- |
  Theoretical Statistics and Applied Mathematics, and added ``As regards
- |
  the Statistical Laboratory, its ultimate status is bound up with the
- |
  possible establishment of a Chair of Mathematical Statistics. It may
- |
  well be appropriate to convert the Statistical Laboratory into a
- |
  Department once such a Chair exists, but it would be premature to do so
- |
  now''.  The formal record is unrevealing on the question of whether
- |
  the true initiative for the establishment of a chair came from the
- |
  University itself, but one contributor to this account is in no doubt.
- |
  ``In spite of pressure from Wishart, Lindley, the RSS and probably
- |
  others, Cambridge University declined to create a Chair of Statistics.
- |
  The RSS Council, probably at Lindley's instigation, decided in disgust
- |
  to try and raise enough money to endow a chair. They gave the job to
- |
  the next President, Maurice Kendall. At first he was a bit put out at
- |
  being asked to raise a huge amount of money for another
- |
  university at a time when he was hard at work drumming up support for
- |
  statistics at LSE, but then he threw himself into the task with
- |
  characteristic generosity and energy and was brilliantly successful.''  The formal records are blander. The Faculty Board's passing
- |
  mention of a Chair quoted above became a firm proposal from the Faculty
- |
  of Mathematics; this is referred to in a report from the Council of the
- |
  Senate to the University in June 1960 ( Reporter,
- |
  1959-60, p. 1684) The establishment of a chair was considered desirable
- |
  ``both because of the long association of the University with advances
- |
  in Mathematical Statistics and the high calibre of Cambridge
- |
  mathematical students, and because...a number of other Faculties who
- |
  call upon the services of the Statistical Laboratory would warmly
- |
  welcome it''. ``The [General] Board have said that they now have reason
- |
  to believe that, by appealing to certain persons and bodies interested
- |
  in the theory and application of the study of statistics, it may be
- |
  possible to secure all or a large part of the funds necessary to
- |
  maintain the Chair.''  The `reason' mentioned by the General Board was the
- |
  preparedness of the Council of Royal Statistical Society to launch an
- |
  appeal to raise money for the chair. According to the RSS itself, it
- |
  had been approached by the Faculty of Mathematics with a request that
- |
  it ``sponsor an appeal...'' (see J. Roy. Statist. Soc. A
- |
  (1961) 124, p. 562). The Society saw this
- |
  as a good cause and put its full weight behind the venture. Its
- |
  President, Dr Maurice Kendall, was indeed outstandingly active in
- |
  pressing the appeal, which by 1961 had been brought to a successful
- |
  conclusion. The contributing companies and banks are listed in J.
- |
  Roy. Statist. Soc. A (1962) 125
- |
  , p. 616.  The University had agreed to the Council of the Senate's
- |
  proposal. In October 1961 the Council announced the successful
- |
  completion of the appeal ( Reporter , 1961--2, p.
- |
  326); it recommended the establishment of the Professorship and that
- |
  the Professor should be ex officio Director of
- |
  the Statistical Laboratory, whose ``establishment on a firm basis'' the
- |
  Faculty Board of Mathematics regarded ``as a matter of great
- |
  importance''. The University accepted these recommendations without
- |
  comment.  The title of the Professorship corresponded to that of the
- |
  Diploma. The duties of the Professor were not prescribed by any
- |
  ordinance, but the origins of the Laboratory, the involvement of the
- |
  Royal Statistical Society and the appeal to `persons and bodies
- |
  interested in the theory and application of the study of statistics'
- |
  made clear the intention.  The Electors to the new Chair met in May 1962 and elected
- |
  David Kendall to the post; he took up duties in October of that year.  That David Kendall should have been elected was not an
- |
  entirely unexpected outcome, his personal claims on grounds of quality
- |
  being overwhelming. It was a maverick outcome, however, in that David
- |
  was much more obviously a probabilist -- and at that time of fairly
- |
  pure leanings -- than a statistician. The matter has been debated then
- |
  and since, not least because it may be argued that the appointment set
- |
  a precedent for the two subsequent elections to the same post. One
- |
  point that must be made is that the Board of Electors was a balanced
- |
  one (with the RSS represented by its President, Maurice Kendall), well
- |
  aware of the nature of the case that had been made both for the post
- |
  and for the appeal which supported it, and the Board certainly
- |
  considered all factors in reaching its decision. An interesting light
- |
  is thrown by Dennis Lindley. He writes that, at the time when he was
- |
  considering whether or not to apply for the Aberystwyth post, ``Maurice
- |
  Kendall was well-advanced in his appeal for money for a chair at
- |
  Cambridge, and had politely made clear to me that David Kendall would
- |
  get it''. The coincidence of surnames is fortuitous -- Maurice and
- |
  David are unrelated -- so Maurice's intention, typically robust, was
- |
  disinterest itself. The quotation makes clear that Maurice was not
- |
  ambushed by other Electors, although another account represents this
- |
  rather as a reluctant acceptance of the fact that David Kendall was
- |
  intrinsically the strongest candidate.  More to the point, one can maintain that David Kendall
- |
  subsequently met the criticisms, in that he became a statistician in
- |
  his own individual way, and an ingenious and enthusiastic one. In
- |
  addition to his continuing work in pure probability (Markov processes,
- |
  stochastic analysis and geometry and random sets) and applied
- |
  probability models (bird navigation, structure of the retina, epidemic
- |
  waves and rumours) he became deeply interested in the inference and
- |
  reconstruction problems of archaeology, such as grave sequencing, the
- |
  reconstruction of local maps from information on contiguity etc., and
- |
  the recognition of regularities such as quanta of measurement and the
- |
  placement patterns of standing stones. These applications all had a
- |
  particular sense of intangibility, and were in fact pioneering and
- |
  advanced examples of the analysis of latent variable models.  David Kendall also `strove for statistics' (in David
- |
  McLaren's phrase) at the operational level. he made efforts to
- |
  establish contacts with statisticians in applied posts, such as Colin
- |
  Campbell and Bob Carpenter; he secured David McLaren (who had joined
- |
  the group from Manchester as a research student), appointment as a
- |
  senior Assistant in research (later an Assistant Director of Research),
- |
  with partial responsibility for statistical consulting, he set up a
- |
  course on inference in Part IB and pioneered the use of TITAN in the
- |
  Lab.  David's appointment brought one immediate political benefit
- |
  to the Laboratory; the mathematicians recognised David as one of their
- |
  own, with the consequence that the standing in the Faculty which the
- |
  Laboratory had earned but not received was now granted overnight. John
- |
  Kingman, now a Fellow of Pembroke and a member of the Lab, was also
- |
  greatly influenced in bringing about change in attitude. Harold
- |
  Davenport's reported reaction to the appointment was: ``Eeh, I did
- |
  worry about who we might get, but eeh, we got a Professor of Statistics
- |
  who knows about lattice points!''. The colleges opened their doors and,
- |
  indeed, from that time there has generally been competition to secure
- |
  the services of Laboratory staff as teaching fellows.  This rapport brought other consequences, however. Given the
- |
  will, the Laboratory could indeed have become a separate department.
- |
  However, it would then have been expected to unify of statistics in the
- |
  University, so reversing the dispersion Norman Bailey mentions. In
- |
  particular, it would have been expected to absorb the statisticians
- |
  rather loosely attached to other Faculties such as Agriculture and
- |
  Medicine and probably to provide service teaching -- teaching for
- |
  Faculties other than Mathematics. Such a course would have meant an
- |
  increase in role but a change in character; there are obvious arguments
- |
  both for and against it. In the event, the Laboratory joined the pure
- |
  mathematicians to constitute the existing Department of Pure
- |
  Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics (DPMMS).  The Lab was still housed in the basement of the Chemistry
- |
  Building when David arrived in 1962. It was honoured in the first term
- |
  by a courtesy call from Fisher. He was carrying a stout stick; John
- |
  Kingman later affected to believe that this was for the administration
- |
  of a cudgelling in case of displeasure. In fact, the occasion seems to
- |
  have been totally amicable, ending in lunch.  John may be playing down his own doughtiness; david McLaren
- |
  recalls the seminar which Fisher had given in Cambridge the previous
- |
  summer. in David's words ``A very recent graduate of the Diploma, I
- |
  arrived rather too promptly, when Fisher was already on his feet.
- |
  However, he insisted on shaking my hand most warmly; presumably his
- |
  short sight prevented him from being sure that I was not the
- |
  Vice-Chancellor".  Fisher's topic was `Sampling the reference set'. John Kingman
- |
  bravely took issue with some of this, advancing to the blackboard to
- |
  demonstrate some counter-argument. Fisher started swinging his stick in
- |
  a most menacing way, not amicable at all. Eventually he dismissed John
- |
  by demanding "What does it matter if the mouse is a Unitarian?"."  In 1964 the whole Faculty was concentrated at the former
- |
  Printing House in Mill Lane, rendered vacant by the University Press's
- |
  move to new premises. The Statistical Laboratory moved with the rest of
- |
  DPMMS into the warehouse building. One may now begin to use the present
- |
  tense. The Mill Lane building is not an elegant one, but it is
- |
  conveniently sited and has served the Department well. Strongly and
- |
  squatly built around a steel frame with a full-plan basement, it rather
- |
  incongruously suggests a war-time bunker. The ground is weak near the
- |
  surface of the river bank; the bridging of the Cam at this point has
- |
  historically presented a civil engineering challenge. As a consequence,
- |
  the Pure wing (the `old warehouse') of the L-shaped building tends to
- |
  slip away from the Statistical wing (the `new warehouse'), giving rise
- |
  to the `Daniels fault' at the junction -- a vertical crack which indeed
- |
  staggers the window of Henry Daniels' present room.  John Kingman accompanied David from Oxford in 1962, as a UAL.
- |
  He was upgraded to UL from April, 1964, at the end of which year he
- |
  left for a term's sabbatical and a post in Brighton. It was immediately
- |
  before his departure and before the move to Mill Lane that John
- |
  rendered his last great service to the Lab. John was a very junior
- |
  member of the committee concerned with allocation of space in the Mill
- |
  Lane building; he saw reconnoitre as his first necessity. ``The credit
- |
  for getting into the warehouse lies with Violet, who had a friend
- |
  (whose name I had better suppress) in the Press. Thus Violet and I got
- |
  into the warehouse, by then cleared of paper but having no internal
- |
  walls except that between the old and the new warehouses. With its iron
- |
  stanchions holding up the heavy floors it was like being on a C19th
- |
  sailing ship.'' However, it turned out that the appointed Master of the
- |
  vessel (Sir William Hodge) had already provisionally consigned the
- |
  Statistical Laboratory to the bilges (the basement -- commodious but
- |
  dismal). Thither it would indeed have been cast had not the brave cabin
- |
  boy (John Kingman) spoken up, sturdily enough that he secured for the
- |
  Lab all of the upper two decks (the upper two floors of the new
- |
  warehouse) aft of the sole bulkhead (the aforesaid wall). John now had
- |
  a free hand in the partitioning of this space. Perhaps in reaction to
- |
  the depths into which he had peered, he was particularly insistent that
- |
  there should be a large common-room with many soft chairs and no
- |
  blackboards.  When David Kendall arrived in 1962 the staff consisted just
- |
  of Violet Cane and Morris Walker, with now the addition of John
- |
  Kingman. On this slight but genetically-rich base the Laboratory began
- |
  to develop life again, in somewhat mutated form. Alfred R?nyi (soon to
- |
  die tragically early) was a visitor in 1963/4 and Jessie McWilliams,
- |
  Joe Kruskal and Ronald Pyke in 1964/5. Through his connections with the
- |
  Atlas Laboratory at Harwell David managed to arrange an Atlas
- |
  Fellowship at Churchill. John Hartigan held this in 1963/4 and helped
- |
  out with lecturing (while Morris Walker was on sabbatical leave in
- |
  Australia). Roy Hodson held it for a time after that -- David was by
- |
  this time well into his archaeological phase. David was elected FRS in
- |
  1964. In that year John Kingman left for Brighton and was replaced by
- |
  Bob Loynes, from Manchester. Bob Bechofer, who visited in 1966/7, was
- |
  prevailed upon to lecture. When leaving he confided to David, in
- |
  amiable honesty: ``Your statistics is terrible!''.  It is not practicable to follow the passage of individual
- |
  research students in the same detail as that of staff. What is natural
- |
  is to recall the members of the research-student group at the times -
- |
  quite definite - when this was especially flourishing. Some notable
- |
  singletons are then likely to be missed; they should be sure that they
- |
  are remembered.  The research students played a particular role during these
- |
  recovery years in giving the group substance; David McLaren, Nick
- |
  Bingham, Daryl Daley, Charles Goldie, John Haigh, Peter Lee, David
- |
  Mannion, and Jane Speakman speak to us from the photographs.  David Williams performed his first transit of the Lab in
- |
  1966/7, when he held a Research Fellowship at Clare. He recurs. Nick
- |
  Bingham recalls him from that time as ``a force of nature -
- |
  unforgettable for linguistic as well as mathematical reasons''.6.
- |
  1966--72: The Churchill Chair;
- |
  Redefinition There was a continuing concern to bring up the Lab's strength
- |
  and, in particular, to restore its historic strength in statistics.
- |
  Esso Petroleum Ltd seemed disposed to be helpful, and David Kendall had
- |
  conversations with Leo Govier of that firm. Initial suggestions were
- |
  modest: that support might be provided for a Diploma student. A year or
- |
  more of discussion, back-reference and variation led to something
- |
  startingly more ambitious: Esso generously endowed the Churchill Chair
- |
  in the Mathematics of Operations Research. This was to be located in
- |
  the Faculty of Mathematics; more specifically, in the Statistical
- |
  Laboratory.  The new chair was advertised in 1966. Peter Whittle was
- |
  elected to the post in August of that year and took up duties in July
- |
  1967. The number of people in the UK who might be said to be
- |
  knowledgeable in the mathematics of OR was small, but Whittle's
- |
  increasing interest in optimisation was deemed sufficiently qualifying,
- |
  and made the move an appropriate one as far as he was concerned.  There may have been an expectation in some quarters that the
- |
  new professor would be, effectively, a professor of statistics, so
- |
  restoring the desired balance. However, Whittle saw the matter in a
- |
  more literal light. For one thing, Esso's intention was clearly that
- |
  the post should be in operational research. But, more than that,
- |
  Whittle considered that what needed development was, not just
- |
  narrow-sense operational research, but the whole area for which there
- |
  is still no good name, but which is variously called `applicable
- |
  mathematics' or `non-physical applied mathematics'. This includes, for
- |
  example, probability, statistics, optimisation, systems theory, game
- |
  theory and those aspects of disciplines such as control theory,
- |
  communication theory and mathematical economics which might be pursued
- |
  by someone technically based in probability and optimisation.
- |
  Developments in the USA since the war have demonstrated, not only the
- |
  practical importance of these topics, but also the depth and coherence
- |
  of the theory they generate.  Surprisingly, Cambridge was ready for these developments.
- |
  Both students and other Faculties had been pressing the Faculty of
- |
  Mathematics to modernise its coverage in precisely these areas, and the
- |
  Faculty had conceded the case. So, the proposal of new Part II courses
- |
  (in convex optimisation, dynamic optimisation and statistical
- |
  communication theory, as it turned out) was welcomed, rather than met
- |
  with the incredulity and resistance which precedent would have led one
- |
  to expect. The new courses had a chequered beginning, but ultimately
- |
  took shape and became accepted components of the Tripos. One may say
- |
  that the optimisation courses have not prospered as they should, but
- |
  the changes in courses and staff anticipated for 1994 promise
- |
  regeneration.  Statisticians outside Cambridge may have watched the partial
- |
  displacement of statistics in Cambridge by probability and
- |
  optimisation, etc. with some dismay, seeing this as an abandonment of
- |
  honourable traditions or a snobbish mathematical elitism. They could
- |
  not be more wrong. There is surely substance in the view that the
- |
  complacency lay outside Cambridge rather than
- |
  within. The many departments of statistics in the country interpreted
- |
  their brief far too narrowly - more narrowly than Galton or Fisher
- |
  would have found natural! It was Cambridge which saw the lack and tried
- |
  to remedy it; a task requiring much hard work and inducing some
- |
  humility. Further, contrary to general belief, Cambridge has continued
- |
  throughout to recognise the special role of statistics and tried to
- |
  restore its own strength in this area. The attempt to cover much of
- |
  applicable mathematics with a smaller staff than is devoted to
- |
  statistics alone in many universities has made this difficult. However,
- |
  strenuous efforts have been made to bring statistics to its proper
- |
  representation, and 1994 may see also these efforts crowned with
- |
  success.  The visitors for the year 1967/8 included Ingram Olkin, Al
- |
  Marshall, Mike Perlman and, again, Alfred R?nyi . Olkin and Marshall
- |
  started a seminar series on inequalities, attended by R?nyi among
- |
  others. This was novel both in content and format: it provided the
- |
  first local experience of a `bag seminar', to which one brought one's
- |
  lunch. Ingram and Al presented their developing ideas on majorisation
- |
  at this seminar, ideas which constituted the basis of their later text
- |
  on the subject. Al also took the chance to enlarge his collection of
- |
  old flutes.  Anthony Edwards was attached to the Lab 1968/70, and began a
- |
  course in Mathematical Genetics which remains a standing option in the
- |
  Diploma, although Anthony sees this course as a development of on begun
- |
  by Fisher and George Owen in 1952/3. While his primary interest is
- |
  mathematical genetics, Anthony is a scholar of both statistical
- |
  inference and the history of statistics in Cambridge; most of the
- |
  formal record in sections 2, 3 and 5 of this account is derived from
- |
  his 1991 notes. His book Likelihood (1972,
- |
  Cambridge University Press) was written during his period of
- |
  attachment. One may also see him as the high priest of those who tend
- |
  the memory of Fisher in the sacred groves of Caius (of which college
- |
  Fisher was a Fellow, as is Anthony). He read a paper to the Royal
- |
  Statistical Society in 1969 on the estimation of evolutionary trees ( J.
- |
  Roy. Statist. Soc. B (1970) 32
- |
  , 155--208). Solution of this difficult and fascinating problem was
- |
  later taken considerably further by his research student, Elizabeth
- |
  Thompson. Robin Sibson tackled the same problem in a different way in
- |
  his study with Nick Jardine of dendrogram techniques (Jardine, N. and
- |
  Sibson, R. (1970) Mathematical Taxonomy, Wiley).
- |
  Both Elizabeth and Robin were appointed at that time to University
- |
  Lectureships in the Lab; Robin from 1970 and Elizabeth from 1971. This
- |
  activity again demonstrates the falsity of the impression that
- |
  statistics lapsed in the Lab after the fifties: the estimation of
- |
  evolutionary trees is an important, subtle and difficult statistical
- |
  problem; exactly the kind of problem that many mainstream statisticians
- |
  will regard as lying outside their brief.  Books published by the staff must serve as an informative if
- |
  insufficient statistic of activity. Peter Whittle published Optimisation
- |
  under Constraints (1971, Wiley) as a text for one of the
- |
  optimisation courses and Probability (1970,
- |
  Penguin). Since this latter took the unconventional approach of
- |
  axiomatising the expectation functional, it was unlikely to be adopted
- |
  for any course, but it was interestingly parallel to the work by de
- |
  Finetti, appearing in English just at that time, which Dennis Lindley
- |
  so espoused.  John Gittins was also loosely attached to the Lab in 1969/70.
- |
  It was at this time that he was developing his solution of the
- |
  multi-armed bandit problem, motivated by the need for a rational
- |
  approach to the allocation of exploratory research effort he had
- |
  encountered while working with Unilever. The multi-armed bandit problem
- |
  was the problem of decision theory over the years
- |
  1945-1980; it embodies the essential problem of balancing
- |
  experimentation against immediate dividend, but seemed so difficult
- |
  that people of some mathematical sophistication regarded it as
- |
  intrinsically insoluble in any conventional sense. Few would have
- |
  believed it if they had been told in 1969 that John had slain the
- |
  dragon. It would be 1979/80 before his classic advance was recognised,
- |
  since when it has transformed a large part of the subject of stochastic
- |
  scheduling.  Violet Cane was instrumental in bringing in the rule that the
- |
  Head of the new department, DPMMS, should be appointed for only five
- |
  years at a time, rather than until retirement. Thus it was that Sir
- |
  William Hodge yielded the Headship to Ian Cassels in 1969.  The unlikely symbiosis of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical
- |
  Statistics might not have succeeded but for Cassels' sympathetic and
- |
  enlightened attitude. A distinguished number theorist himself, Cassels
- |
  could see, not only that a high proportion of the Faculty's graduates
- |
  found a career in statistics and related disciplines, but also that
- |
  these subjects were intrinsically interesting. Indeed, he was the first
- |
  mathematician to give the Part II course in Mathematical Economics
- |
  (previously given by a member of the Faculty of Economics), developing
- |
  and publishing his own course text. It was Ian who repeatedly
- |
  encouraged the Lab to think big. This venturesome attitude was in
- |
  contrast to his lesser concern for domestic matters. When money had to
- |
  be found it was always taken off the cleaning budget, which, despite
- |
  its consequent exponential decline, always seemed to have some capacity
- |
  for sacrifice left in it.  In 1969 David McLaren left for a post in Glasgow;
- |
  cross-border balance was preserved by recruitment of Ted Harding from
- |
  Edinburgh. His was regarded as a post in statistics.  Robin Sibson was appointed in 1970 to a new University
- |
  Lectureship notionally assigned to Operational Research. He developed a
- |
  later interest in optimal experimental design, a subject experiencing a
- |
  renaissance at that time, and in which Cambridge, Imperial College and
- |
  Glasgow for a while formed a triumvirate. All three groups enjoyed
- |
  visits from Valery Federov, who had just written his book on the
- |
  subject. The pleasantness of his company was not diminished by the
- |
  possibility that he was perhaps more than a simple academic.  Another statistical appointment was made in 1970. Pat Altham
- |
  was appointed as Assistant Director of Research (ADR) and also given
- |
  specific responsibility for the running of the Diploma by being
- |
  nominated Director of Studies. She had continued in these duties ever
- |
  since (although later as UL) and has become less dispensable than
- |
  anybody should be allowed to be. As a relic of her ADRship Pat fields
- |
  the statistical queries that come in both from other departments and
- |
  from outside the University, and herself deals with most of them. As
- |
  Director of Studies she does much of the teaching for the Diploma
- |
  itself plus all of the administration: e.g. the organisation of
- |
  admissions, courses, examinations and applied projects. The project
- |
  retains its central role in the Diploma course, but to find applied
- |
  areas of the right level and interest equipped with a willing applied
- |
  supervisor is by no means easy. In fact, the scheme is workable only
- |
  because of the contacts and goodwill Pat has built up through her
- |
  consultation work.  David Kendall's `fields of application' continued to be
- |
  archaeology and astronomy, but there were outliers. A pig-breeder
- |
  called to see him, and David listened, silently but sympathetically, to
- |
  a long discourse on swine fever. At the end of this his client rose and
- |
  thanked him cordially for a most valuable discussion. Years later the
- |
  same man wrote, recalling the conversation and thanking David profusely
- |
  for opening his mind to totally new insights on the question of swine
- |
  fever.  The Laboratory suffered a sad loss in the summer of 1970 by
- |
  the death of Rollo Davidson in a climbing accident in the Alps. Rollo
- |
  had been a research student in the Lab, had held a Junior Research
- |
  Fellowship at Trinity and just been elected to a Teaching Fellowship at
- |
  Churchill. He was regarded as being of quite exceptional promise. Rollo
- |
  had published on Delphic semi-groups, p-functions and stochastic
- |
  geometry, and was beginning to pose questions in statistics and
- |
  optimisation. The talent that had been lost was commemorated by the
- |
  compilation of two memorial volumes (eds. Kendall and Harding, 1973 and
- |
  1974). The income from these was used to found the Rollo Davidson
- |
  Trust, from which prizes for distinguished research by younger workers
- |
  have been awarded annually since 1976.  A course introduced about this time was based on a suggestion
- |
  of Rollo's, which he would have developed himself had he lived. This
- |
  was the `Markov methods' course in Part IB. A need was felt for a
- |
  probability course of an applied character; to build it around the
- |
  Markov theme gave a natural lead into stochastic processes. As nobility
- |
  is said to need the constant (if covert) infusion of common blood to
- |
  maintain its vigour, so probability courses need a constant reminder of
- |
  applications if they are not to waft themselves to Gallic heights and
- |
  disappear. This seems to be a law of nature, and is the reason why
- |
  probability is too important to be left to the probabilists.  In 1971 Violet Cane left for the Manchester chair. She was
- |
  replaced by Elizabeth Thompson, a formidable young lady who handled all
- |
  the statistics courses with laconic ease. Elizabeth naturally took over
- |
  the Mathematical Genetics course as well, and tackled the Communication
- |
  Theory course (which a few loved and most would not touch) with relish
- |
  -- perhaps because it gave her a chance to talk about DNA sequences.
- |
  Her work on inference problems for evolutionary trees continued; in
- |
  1975 she was to publish Human Evolutionary Trees
- |
  (Cambridge University Press).7.
- |
  1972-85 Comings and goings
- |
   
- |
  The terms of the Chair of Mathematical Statistics made the Professor ex
- |
  officio Director of the Laboratory. However, these had been
- |
  formulated in the days when the Laboratory had but one chair. Perhaps
- |
  David Kendall was aware of the belief that eleven or twelve years is
- |
  the maximal natural term of office; in any case, in 1973 he managed to
- |
  have the tie loosed and Peter Whittle appointed as Director.
- |2
   The new stage was set in the pleasantest fashion by the
- |
  appointment of Geoff Eagleson to a ULship and the appearance of Bruce
- |
  Brown as a visitor in 1972. Geoff Eagleson played a profoundly positive
- |
  role in the Laboratory; in teaching, research, student contact and the
- |
  good thrift of the Laboratory generally. When one thinks back to the
- |
  founding fathers of the Laboratory, one regards them as examples of
- |
  ancient virtue which cannot be equalled. However, in dedication and
- |
  character Geoff equalled anybody. He is one of a whole sequence of
- |
  Australians who have contributed to the Laboratory's life and success.
- |
  Bruce Brown was conspicuously another, but one thinks particularly of
- |
  the magnificent succession of research students: Daryl Daley, John
- |
  Pollard, Richard Tweedie, Tim Brown, Iain MacPhee, Phil Pollett, Adrian
- |
  Baddeley, Alan Branford, Steve Evans, Ben Hambly, Terence Chan, Steve
- |
  Hanly, Nigel Bean, Jo Kennedy and Owen Jones. These were all good, some
- |
  of them the very best, and they have kept the Lab's graduate research
- |
  going at times when UK recruitment was thin. After all these years one
- |
  may reveal a fact known to Charles Goldie: that John Pollard secretly
- |
  doubled up his studies for his Ph.D. and his actuarial examinations.  In fact, recruitment was by no means thin in the early/mid
- |
  seventies, which was one of those periods when the research-student
- |
  group developed a particularly vivid and productive life of its own.
- |
  One recalls David Aldous, Frank Kelly, John Kent, Bill McGinley, David
- |
  Probert, Brian Ripley, Jeremy Rudge and Bernie Silverman.  Geoff Eagleson worked closely with Andrew Barbour, who had
- |
  been associated with the Lab from 1969; successively as Diploma
- |
  student, research student, Fellow of Caius and Director of Studies for
- |
  that college. Andrew made a succession of strong advances in
- |
  probability on the pure/applied borderline. His talents were recognised
- |
  adequately first when he was appointed to a chair in Z?rich in 1984.  Ian Cassels' continued exhortation and support bore fruit in
- |
  1974 in the form of another Lectureship, to be notionally assigned to
- |
  Operational Research. Doug Kennedy was appointed; immediately from
- |
  Sheffield but, before that, from Trinity College Dublin and Stanford.
- |
  With his Stanford background Doug was the only staff member with any
- |
  formal OR training.  Life was enriched when Wally Smith, Joel Cohen and John
- |
  Hajnal spent a sabbatical year at the Lab in 1974/5 and Henry Daniels
- |
  in 1975/6. It was a particular pleasure to have Henry and Wally back -
- |
  a link with the St Andrew's Hill days. Henry divided his time between
- |
  the Lab and the King's College Research Centre, where he was charged
- |
  with the organisation of a seminar in mathematical biology.  Various references have been made to the less than palatial
- |
  housing of the Department. In this connection, Kevin Donnelly (research
- |
  student 1976/9, now answering to Caoimhin O Donnaile) tells how he
- |
  found Thomas Bruss (research student from Germany, now in Brussels)
- |
  taking a photograph of the main entry to the Department, a warehouse
- |
  back-door flanked by milk-bottles and randomly-packed bicycles. He
- |
  intended to send this to his parents, who could not otherwise be
- |
  convinced that such a prestigious department was to be approached
- |
  through such portals. Kevin also tells a story which charity bids us
- |
  dismiss as apocryphal. One student was heard asking another the purpose
- |
  of the gigantic rubbish bins outside the actual back-door of the
- |
  Department. His friend explained that these were for discarded notes
- |
  and that ``they are sometimes picked through by Oxford research
- |
  students desperate for material for their theses''.  Alistair Mees was appointed to a ULship in 1975, again
- |
  notionally allocated to Operational Research. It was always difficult
- |
  to find staff in OR; since there were virtually no mathematically
- |
  advanced courses in OR in the country very few had such a training.
- |
  With luck one could find someone with USA training (as in Doug
- |
  Kennedy's case) or else someone of approximating interests and
- |
  sufficient enthusiasm to bridge the gap (as in Robin Sibson's case).
- |
  The latter was the case also for Alistair. He had worked in control
- |
  theory, largely in the analysis of nonlinear systems, and later won an
- |
  Adams Prize for his essay Dynamics of Feedback Systems
- |
  em> (Wiley, 1981). While maintaining his interest in nonlinear
- |
  dynamics he also moved seriously and permanently into optimisation and
- |
  associated algorithmics.  Jim Pitman was appointed to a ULship in 1976, bringing both
- |
  the highest standards in probability and an honoured name. Jim's
- |
  natural sphere is the USA and in 1978 he returned to Berkeley. He was
- |
  replaced by the appointment of Frank Kelly to a ULship. This meant
- |
  reiving a valued young member of staff from the Control and Management
- |
  Studies Group of the Department of Engineering, but its Head, Alastair
- |
  MacFarlane, bore no grudge. Relations of the Lab with the Department of
- |
  Engineering have always been good, particularly with Control
- |
  Engineering and with Management Studies (which for a time had a joint
- |
  existence but are now again separate). There are natural communities of
- |
  interest, of course, although this is in general no guarantee of
- |
  amicability, and there has been movement of members between the groups
- |
  in both directions (e.g. John Gittins, Stephen Watson, Frank Kelly and
- |
  Richard Weber).  Frank's return was to have profound long-term consequences
- |
  for the Lab. It was a return, because Frank had been a Ph.D. student in
- |
  the Lab 1973/6. He had been supervised by Peter Whittle in the area of
- |
  Jackson networks, with its associated reversibility and balance
- |
  concepts. This class of ideas turned out to be butter to Frank's
- |
  remarkable intuition. Frank achieved extensions of the Jackson theory
- |
  not only for the queueing context but also for other and apparently
- |
  unrelated application areas. His book Reversibility and
- |
  Stochastic Networks (Wiley, 1979) demonstrated the striking
- |
  unification thus achieved, and made Frank's name instantaneously.  The tempo seemed to increase in those years. Peter Whittle
- |
  was elected FRS in 1978. His discovery in 1979 of an alternative proof
- |
  of the optimality of the Gittins index policy for the multi-armed
- |
  bandit problem had the effect of bringing about the long-overdue
- |
  recognition of John Gittins' solution of the problem.  Retiring professors were also beginning to home back to the
- |
  Lab: Henry Daniels from Birmingham in 1978 and Violet Cane from
- |
  Manchester in 1981. That Violet should return was expected, since she
- |
  had kept her cottage in Little St Mary's Lane. However, that Henry
- |
  should wish to do so was both surprising and gratifying. Henry had a
- |
  respect for red-brick virtues and found these notably lacking in
- |
  Cambridge; the college slights of earlier years still rankled. However,
- |
  perhaps he found some of the Lab's work in applied probability to his
- |
  taste. The reverse compliment certainly holds; he is held in high
- |
  regard and affection, and is doughty enough in controversy to be
- |
  allowed no quarter, despite his age. He was elected FRS in 1980,
- |
  bringing the Lab count to three. Belated but generous justice was
- |
  achieved by David Williams in 1992, when Henry was made an Honorary
- |
  Fellow of Clare.  Manfred Gordon, a polymer chemist who had published classic
- |
  work on the statistics of polymers with Jack Good, had been a visitor
- |
  in the Lab 1972/3. In 1978 he retired from Essex and also took up
- |
  residence in the Lab. Manfred had hoped that the interest in the
- |
  probabilistic aspects of polymerisation which he shared with Peter
- |
  Whittle would form the basis for some real programme. Alas, the
- |
  Laboratory was in its familiar quandary of having to split its limited
- |
  human capital too many ways, and simply could not afford this venture.
- |
  Interestingly, B?la Bollob?s and his stable of random graph theorists
- |
  were working along parallel lines, although in a style different enough
- |
  that collaboration was never natural. However, Manfred, even if
- |
  disappointed, continues to illuminate the Lab with his gentle erudition
- |
  and wide culture.  Martin Barlow was appointed to a ULship in 1982. He
- |
  reinforced the extraordinarily high quality of the group, many of them
- |
  research students, working on stochastic integrals, stochastic
- |
  differential equations and flows and spatial processes on strange
- |
  manifolds.  In 1983 there was a contentious move, in a literal sense. The
- |
  DPMMS library, which had been housed on the first floor of the DPMMS
- |
  building, was moved into the library vacated by the Faculty of Classics
- |
  at the top of the Mill Lane Lecture Block, just over the road. The old
- |
  quarters had been cramped; the new quarters are not merely roomy, but
- |
  also beautiful. The former Classics Library is light, lofty and
- |
  elegant; a sequence of two-tiered galleried bays in light oak is
- |
  suffused by a clear natural light from above. Undoubtedly some
- |
  convenience has been lost in the translation, probably more from the
- |
  vertical component than the horizontal one. However, this is perhaps
- |
  one case when academics' known inability to refuse an offer has led to
- |
  the right outcome.  Publications again: in 1981 Elizabeth Thompson published Genealogical
- |
  and Genetic Structure with Chris Cannings (Cambridge
- |
  University Press) and in 1982/3 Peter Whittle published the two-volume Optimisation
- |
  over Time (Wiley).  There were a number of losses in 1984. The Lab lost a friend
- |
  in office when Ian Cassels retired. Martin Barlow resigned to
- |
  concentrate on research, and Alistair Mees resigned to take up a chair
- |
  in Western Australia.  With the loss of Alistair the difficulty of finding an OR
- |
  replacement had again to be faced. It was solved by the appointment of
- |
  Colin Sparrow, highly regarded for his work in nonlinear dynamics,
- |
  notably chaos theory. Colin's actions are based on pragmatism and
- |
  principle; convention is not so much disregarded as irrelevant. To fill
- |
  a longish gap between graduation and the securing of a post in King's
- |
  he had driven a bus in Cambridge and had sold ice-cream on King's
- |
  Parade (wearing a top-hat, to the tourists' delight). The appointment
- |
  stretched the range of interests represented in the Laboratory by more
- |
  than was wise or comfortable, but the Lab has benefited greatly from
- |
  Colin's idiosyncratic virtues.8.
- |
  1985--92 Martingales and the Mabinogion
- |2+

- |
  David Kendall was due to retire in 1985. The usual measures were taken
- |
  to advertise the post, in the sober and sincere intention that a
- |
  genuine statistician should be appointed if possible. However, that the
- |
  Lab is part of the Faculty of Mathematics places its own constraints.
- |
  One has to meet the standards of the Faculty (the students would be
- |
  merciless towards anyone who did not) and the Lab now had its own
- |
  developed standards as a group in applicable mathematics. It is perhaps not divulging too much to say that there were
- |
  two very strong statistical figures in the running; one of these
- |
  ultimately withdrew and the other presented special problems. The
- |
  Electors were then faced with a rerun of the 1962 scenario; David
- |
  Williams was so clearly the strongest residual candidate that he was
- |
  elected. He then joined the Laboratory in 1985. Two others effectively
- |
  came with him from Swansea; Chris Rogers was appointed as a UL and, in
- |
  1986, James Norris to a New Blood post as UAL. With these two
- |
  appointments the strength of the Lab in pure probability was clearly
- |
  maintained, and its average age decreased.  David Williams brought the highest degree of professional
- |
  strength, together with a particular warmth and generosity of
- |
  personality. Sensitive to the possible charge of mathematical
- |
  preciousness (which he of all people could have disregarded) he
- |
  lectured and supervised a whole range of courses in probability and
- |
  statistics. He gave two graduate lecture series (Connections and
- |
  Percolation) which bridged probability, modern physics and pure
- |
  mathematics with rare power and evoked sustained interest from the
- |
  staff of the whole Faculty. His breadth manifested itself in the truest
- |
  fashion; students left David's courses knowing something of the
- |
  Mabinogion as well as of martingales.  In retirement David Kendall developed his study of
- |
  standing-stone configurations into a `theory of shape', working with a
- |
  very bright visitor from mainland China: Huiling Le. In the following
- |
  years he was awarded the Royal Statistical Society's Guy Medal in Gold
- |
  and the De Morgan Medal of the London Mathematical Society,
- |
  complementing the Sylvester Medal already awarded by the Royal Society.
- |
  However, David maintains that it is his founding of the Bernoulli
- |
  Society, jointly with Jerzy Neyman, which gives him the greatest
- |
  satisfaction.  David Kendall continued to occupy a room in the Lab and use
- |
  computing facilities. University departments vary widely in their
- |
  practice towards retired members. University policy must of course be
- |
  that they have no rights, and departments under the severest resource
- |
  pressures must also see it this way. However, groups which consider
- |
  that they can both stretch resources and avoid the problems an
- |
  insensitive senior retir? might pose do in fact offer a continuing
- |
  home. Henry Daniels had been given a room on this basis, as David was
- |
  now. Violet Cane and Manfred Gordon had received partial facilities on
- |
  the same basis. One must not see this practice as resting on pure
- |
  charity or sentiment; the `Advanced Fellows' offer depth to the group
- |
  in several ways, and their presence is often particularly appreciated
- |
  by the youngest members of the group: the graduate students. One might
- |
  also say that any other attitude would scarcely be consistent with a
- |
  healthy feeling of group identity.  It was in 1986 that Elizabeth Thompson published her Pedigree
- |
  Analysis in Human Genetics (Johns Hopkins Press) and then
- |
  resigned to take a chair of statistics at the University of Washington.
- |
  It was a pity to lose her from the Lab, but a greater pity to lose her
- |
  from the country. She had applied for chairs of statistics in the UK,
- |
  but committees with a narrow concept of statistics appointed candidates
- |
  clearly her inferior.  As argued earlier, books published by the staff do not
- |
  reflect everything, but they must reflect something. In 1986 Wiley
- |
  published Peter Whittle's Systems in Stochastic Equilibrium
- |
  and in 1987 the revision by Chris Rogers and David Williams of Vol. 2
- |
  of David's Diffusions, Markov Processes and Martingales.
- |
  To anticipate somewhat, in 1990 Wiley published Peter Whittle's Risk-sensitive
- |
  Optimal Control and in 1991 Cambridge University Press
- |
  brought out two sets of lecture notes based on existing Part II
- |
  courses. These were Communication Theory (Charles
- |
  Goldie and Richard Pinch) and Probability with Martingales
- |
  (David Williams).  A very significant and encouraging development was the
- |
  emergence in 1985 of the Stochastic Networks Group. Frank Kelly's
- |
  interest in queueing networks had developed, through a contact with
- |
  British Telecom which was later formalised, into an interest in
- |
  communication networks. Communication and computer specialists
- |
  worldwide were beginning to recognise that such systems generate
- |
  interesting and difficult stochastic problems, with optimisation (or at
- |
  least good performance) very much a consideration. Frank had attracted
- |
  some very good students to this field early in the decade (e.g. Iain
- |
  MacPhee and Ilze Ziedins). However, by the mid-eighties a very bright
- |
  and substantial group had been formed by the arrival of Richard
- |
  Gibbens, Graham Louth, Phil Hunt and Neil Laws; this was reinforced by
- |
  the development of a close working relationship with British Telecom.
- |
  The group now constituted itself the Stochastic Networks Group. It also
- |
  provided the first case in which the Lab had clearly achieved critical
- |
  mass on any research topic. Over the years a modest staff had been
- |
  trying to cover a wide field, with the result that real concentration
- |
  was reached on no single topic. The critical local density was now
- |
  achieved for the first time. Moreover, the group was answering an
- |
  advanced technological need at just the right time. The introduction of
- |
  electronic telephone exchanges means that, for example, new
- |
  call-routing methods are both possible and necessary. Frank Kelly and
- |
  Richard Gibbens evolved the Dynamic Alternative Routing scheme, which
- |
  provides near-optimal performance by simple means and has since been
- |
  put into practice by British Telecom. This is only an example of the
- |
  type of challenge large systems are offering. The Stochastic Networks
- |
  Group (and with it the Lab), although small enough in all conscience,
- |
  now has a high international reputation in the study of communications
- |
  networks. It is likely that an Institute of Telecommunications will be
- |
  founded in the University of Cambridge in the near future, supported by
- |
  industry, with the Stochastic Networks Group as one of its prime
- |
  components.  The impression created by the many references to the
- |
  Brunsviga should now be corrected; computing facilities in the Lab have
- |
  of course kept pace with the times. They are used as a teaching adjunct
- |
  only for the Diploma practical class and occasional other courses, such
- |
  as the multivariate analysis class. However, everybody computes, of
- |
  course, and reactionaries who do not have this basic skill are now so
- |
  rare as to be acquiring antiquity value.  The manual Brunsvigas continued in class use until at least
- |
  1947/8, although being progressively replaced by electromechanical
- |
  machines from about 1944. By 1964 the mainframe Titan was then also
- |
  available, using autocode and paper tape. Hewlett-Packard pocket
- |
  calculators were adopted in 1973, followed by programmable calculators
- |
  in the late seventies. Fortran was by now used for calculations on the
- |
  IBM mainframe. In 1983 the change was made to BBC micros, using a Torch
- |
  disc drive, BASIC, and with Glim available on disc. Statistical
- |
  packages also became available on the mainframe: SAD, BMDP, Genstat and
- |
  SPSS. Computing power in the Lab was greatly enhanced in 1987 by
- |
  Hewlett-Packard's donation of several Unix work-stations. It was the
- |
  manifest success of the Stochastic Networks Group which prompted
- |
  Hewlett-Packard to make this generous and much-appreciated gift. These
- |
  work-stations were linked; about this time the ethernet local area
- |
  network was installed throughout the Lab. Now, in 1993, the network is
- |
  being greatly enhanced, with the provision of X-windows and packages
- |
  such as Splus, Glim and Mathematica.  A refreshing interlude was provided in 1986/7 by David Banks,
- |
  who gave highly appreciated and capable relief teaching in statistics
- |
  for the year. David came from Berkeley and returned to Carnegie-Mellon,
- |
  and it was he who made us realise what a positive benefit such a
- |
  `casual' can be. In both classroom and commonroom David at once fitted
- |
  in and brought a breath of fresh air; we feel that he left us rather
- |
  than that he visited us.  There were various developments in 1987. One was David
- |
  Williams' resigned assumption of the Directorship. Another was the
- |
  Royal Statistical Society's celebration of its Charter Centenary by a
- |
  three-day meeting in Cambridge (more particularly, in the Cambridge
- |
  Union). The Lab provided local organisation, a task it carried out
- |
  willingly and enjoyed. Finally, there was a welcome accession of
- |
  strength on the statistical side with the appointment of Alastair Young
- |
  to a UALship. He and Henry Daniels cooperated on a mathematical
- |
  evaluation of the bootstrap method.  Peter Whittle was awarded an SERC Senior Fellowship for the
- |
  years 1988/91 to enable him to work on another variety of networks:
- |
  neural networks. The consequent necessity of finding a temporary
- |
  teaching replacement again provided a bonus. Charles Goldie was
- |
  appointed for a two-year period which was, reasonably enough, as much
- |
  absence as the University of Sussex would allow him. Charles proved
- |
  eager and capable in high degree. He took on the courses in convex
- |
  optimisation and communication theory, which were quite new to him,
- |
  with enthusiasm and thoroughness. An byproduct in the second case was
- |
  the CUP course text, already mentioned, written with Richard Pinch.  There was little expectation that one would find a third-year
- |
  replacement to match Charles, who had been the happiest solution in
- |
  every respect. However, Yurii Suhov, from Moscow, showed interest. He
- |
  had already visited the Lab and, with his background in statistical
- |
  communication theory among other things, seemed a very good bet,
- |
  although obviously in some respects an outside one. Visa trouble
- |
  delayed him in Dublin until late January 1991, which made him thrice
- |
  welcome when he came. He was appointed to a regular ULship later that
- |
  year. Yurii brings skill in the applications of probability to
- |
  statistical physics; also the well-known strengths of the mathematical
- |
  culture in which he was brought up.  In 1989 Frank Kelly was elected an FRS; a happy development
- |
  in itself, and one which brought the Lab's tally to five (Henry Daniels
- |
  and David Kendall being assuredly counted always as Lab members). This
- |
  was followed by his appointment to a personal chair.  Chris Rogers left in 1991 for a chair at Queen Mary and
- |
  Westfield College, London, joining Charles Goldie there. Chris had been
- |
  a great enthusiast for all stochastic analysis related to Brownian
- |
  motion. In recent years he had also developed an interest in
- |
  applications: to some part in statistical consultancy but to some part
- |
  also in financial modelling. The quite sophisticated mathematical
- |
  analysis of option-pricing and the like has engaged the attention of
- |
  many probabilists over recent years: in Cambridge, of Chris Rogers,
- |
  Doug Kennedy and David Williams. In 1993/4 it will find its way into a
- |
  Part II course.  Chris Rogers was replaced (although the correspondence
- |
  between resignations and appointments is inexact) by the appointment of
- |
  Gareth Roberts as a UAL in 1992. Gareth's background was originally in
- |
  probability, but he had moved much more into statistics while at
- |
  Nottingham with Adrian Smith.  In 1991 David Williams resigned from his chair,
- |
  characteristically giving for notice as much time as would be needed to
- |
  find his replacement. He had made earlier resignation attempts,
- |
  alleging his own inadequacy for the post, a charge so ludicrous that
- |
  words could scarcely be found to counter it. David Kendall and Peter
- |
  Whittle had baulked these by writing independently to the
- |
  Vice-Chancellor and asserting (sincerely and without collusion) that
- |
  David Williams was the best Director the Laboratory had ever had.
- |
  However, he was now resolved. His real reasons were perhaps the obvious
- |
  ones: a weariness with administration, a desire to get more of his own
- |
  work done, and hiraeth -- longing for Wales. However, strangely, and as
- |
  no one in Cambridge had realised, when David left Swansea in 1985 he
- |
  had announced to the Senate there that he intended to occupy the
- |
  Cambridge post for just seven years.  The fixity of David's decision was recognised, and Frank
- |
  Kelly took over the Directorship in 1991. The intention that David
- |
  should thus be spared worry in his last year at Cambridge was not in
- |
  fact fulfilled; the difficulties of house-moving had reached their
- |
  now-familiar intensity, and David suffered serious health problems. It
- |
  was with great regret that the Lab saw him depart in 1992; an era of
- |
  particular warmth and vitality had closed. 9.
- |
  1992--:Regeneration
- |2+

- |
  David Williams had given the Electors good time in which to replace
- |
  him, and the same care was taken to prepare a good field as in 1985,
- |
  with the same genuine anxiety to do right by statistics. However, to
- |
  the outside observer the election also provided a re-run of history.
- |
  Several outstandingly strong probabilists had applied; the statistical
- |
  field was sound, but less outstanding, even if one measured each of the
- |
  two fields by the world standards of its own discipline. The
- |
  statisticians were certainly given a margin of preference; against this
- |
  one must perhaps reckon an anxiety that the existing strengths of the
- |
  Laboratory should not be gratuitously jeopardised.
- |2
   The outcome was that Geoffrey Grimmett was elected; he left
- |
  Bristol and took up his post in October of 1992. Geoffrey had made a
- |
  very strong name in the study of percolation processes and of random
- |
  graphs, interests which abut those of several in the Lab and the
- |
  University.  The long-felt unease within the Laboratory itself that the
- |
  subject of statistics was inadequately represented was now supplemented
- |
  by a growing realisation that the regime in which the Lab's first chair
- |
  continued to be filled by a probabilist might be self-perpetuating, and
- |
  indeed that such a pattern might not even be unreasonable if the Lab's
- |
  existing strength in the central topic of probability was to be
- |
  preserved. Moves were then set afoot to establish a third chair, to be
- |
  called the Chair of Statistics or whichever variant would emphasise its
- |
  protected nature: that it should under no circumstances be filled by
- |
  any other than a genuine statistician.  The course of this last election reinforced the unease;
- |
  indeed, the conscience of some of the Electors was appeased only by the
- |
  undertaking from John Coates, now the Head of DPMMS, that the proposed
- |
  Chair of Statistics would be the top Faculty priority. This is no light
- |
  undertaking, but John, whose understanding and support for the Lab have
- |
  matched those of Ian Cassels, gave it unequivocally. It was further
- |
  decided that the search for suitable candidates for the new chair would
- |
  be undertaken much more deliberately and systematically than is the
- |
  Cambridge habit: that a Search Committee would be formed to actively
- |
  beat the world of statistics, and that the members of this committee
- |
  would ultimately form the nucleus of the Board of Electors. At the time
- |
  of writing the case for the establishment of the Chair has just been
- |
  accepted by the General Board of the University, and it is hoped that
- |
  the post will be filled by October 1994.  Despite the great widening of its interests, the Laboratory
- |
  remains the Statistical Laboratory and the Diploma remains the Diploma
- |
  in Mathematical Statistics. However inadequate these may now seem as
- |
  descriptions, the feeling has been that to change them would be like
- |
  trying to doctor one's foundation stone. It is believed on the other
- |
  hand that they constitute no false claim.  In particular, the term `Operational Research' has not crept
- |
  into either title. For reasons which would take too long to recount, OR
- |
  activity in the Lab has been even more divorced from the activity of
- |
  the `OR community' than has been the corresponding case in statistics.
- |
  Nevertheless, it is notable that the Lab has supplied the only winners
- |
  in the UK (and among the few in Europe) of the Lanchester Prize of the
- |
  Operational Research Society of America: Peter Whittle in 1987 and
- |
  Frank Kelly in 1992. Perhaps the term `operational research' is no
- |
  longer a fair description of what one is trying to do; something like
- |
  `the mathematics of systems' may be nearer.  The success of the Laboratory depends on all its staff and
- |
  the depth they supply; to measure the state of the Laboratory by the
- |
  state of its professorial staff would be invidious and misleading.
- |
  Nevertheless, the fact that the Statistical Laboratory has now
- |
  progressed to a professorial staff of four does underline the great
- |
  change in its circumstances since the fifties, and the composition of
- |
  this staff signals rejuvenescence and promise. Frank Kelly and Geoffrey
- |
  Grimmett are both young and of high international reputation. If, as
- |
  one may reasonably expect, they are matched by those soon to be elected
- |
  to the Churchill Chair and to the new Chair of Statistics, then,
- whatever the Lab does in the coming years, it will lead.10. References

  \n10. References\n \n A Realised Path\n1. Clarificatory The hope that these notes
  would have some claim to serve as a\ndocument of record has limited the character
  of the anecdotal material\nthat could be included; roughly, it could not be gratuitously
  hurtful\nand it had to have some point. \n The following abbreviations are used
  in the less formal parts\nof the text: Lab for Statistical Laboratory, UL for University\nLecturer,
  UAL for University Assistant Lecturer, OR for Operational\nResearch, DPMMS for the
  Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical\nStatistics and DAMTP for the Department
  of Applied Mathematics and\nTheoretical Physics. \n Some of the long-serving members
  of the computing staff\nfigure in the article. The members of the secretarial staff
  have been\nmany and various; rough justice is perhaps best achieved by naming the\nfirst
  and the last, both of whom have some special character. Beata\nReifenberg was the
  Lab Secretary in the St Andrew's Hill days. Wally\nSmith says of her: ``I have seldom
  encountered an equal in all the days\nsince then. Her great ambition was to be able
  to afford to buy all the\nBrandenburg concertos on long-play records''. Sarah Shea-Simonds
  has\nbeen Secretary since 1985; it is Sarah who stirred the Laboratory into\nthe
  actions, long contemplated but not hitherto undertaken, of\ncelebrating this anniversary
  and writing this history. \n This 2001 revision of the text corrects some minor
  errors and\nadds material which came in too late to be incorporated in the 1993\nversion;
  notably from Frank Anscombe, Norman Bailey, Colin Campbell,\nAnthony Edwards, Charles
  Goldie, David McLaren and Ingram Olkin. These\nadditions still concern only the
  period up to 1993 (to the point of an\napparent obliviousness of staff changes made
  soon after); events after\nthat are left to some other chronicler.\n 2.\nPrehistory\n
  There had been considerable activity in statistics in\nCambridge well before 1947,
  distinguished initially by some striking\nindividual figures and then by a quickening
  recognition of the subject\nas a field in its own right. In coverage of the earliest
  phases we draw\nlargely (and briefly) on Edwards (1991). \n Edwards regards statistics
  as beginning in Cambridge with\nAugustus de Morgan (matriculated 1923), followed
  in that century by\nR.L. Ellis (1836), J. Venn (1853), J.W.L. Glaisher (1867), all
  prime\nnames in any history of statistics or probability. F.J.M. Stratton\n(1901)
  lectured on the Combination of Observations; Edwards' mention\nthat Fisher attended
  his lectures in 1911 gives a link with living\nmemory. \n In 1912 a University Lectureship
  in Statistics was\nestablished to which G. Udny Yule was appointed, working in the
  Faculty\nof Agriculture. Yule was already the author of a very influential\ntextbook
  ( An Introduction to the Theory of Statistics,\nGriffin, 1911), but is now remembered
  for his subsequent work in time\nseries analysis. He opened a new era in this subject
  by his proposal of\nthe autoregressive process. Yule retired in 1931, by then a
  Reader, but\nremained an active figure. Maurice Bartlett mentions of his\npostgraduate
  year (1932/3) that Yule ``was very much one of my mentors,\nas he no doubt was of
  Maurice Kendall, who was a Cambridge student before\nthe Wishart era'' \n While
  the Statistical Laboratory has been the product of many\ninfluences, it is in the
  School of Agriculture that one rightly sees\nits genesis. Statistics has been fostered
  there as a tool and as a\ndiscipline from the days of Professor T.B. Wood, Udny
  Yule was a\nseminal and international figure and it was the interaction of the\nSchool
  and the Faculty of Mathematics (through the mediation of John\nWishart, as we shall
  see) which produced both the Statistical\nLaboratory and the Diploma. The School
  has continued its own vital\ninterest in the subject with the A.R.C. Statistics
  Group. The history\nof these developments has been set out very thoroughly by Colin\nCampbell
  (1959). \n Harold Jeffreys came squarely on to the Cambridge academic\nscene when
  he was appointed a College Lecturer (St. John's) in 1922,\nthis being converted
  to a University Lectureship in 1926. Jeffreys'\nprimary interest, which was geophysics,
  stimulated him to a strong\nderived interest in inference. His books Scientific
  Inference\n(Cambridge University Press, 1931; third edition 1975) and Theory\nof
  Probability (Clarendon Press, 1939; third edition 1961)\nestablished his reputation
  in that field, then and now. Jeffreys'\napproach to inference (and by `probability'
  he often means statistical\ninference; by `inverse probability' he always does)
  was explicitly\nBayesian, with maximum entropy criteria also clearly formulated,
  and so\nstill finds considerable resonance. \n Yule was succeeded on retirement
  in 1931 by John Wishart,\narriving from Rothamsted. Wishart's Readership was primarily
  assigned\nto the Faculty of Agriculture, but the terms of his post directed him\nto
  give courses for mathematicians as well as for postgraduate students\nin agriculture.
  Bartlett writes: ``as there was space allotted to\nWishart in the School of Agriculture,
  where practical classes in\nstatistics were given, my own inclination is always
  to think of a\n`Statistical Laboratory' being in existence from Wishart's arrival
  in\nCambridge''. \n Some idea of the activity at this time may be gained from\nEdwards'
  observation that a student taking Part III of the Mathematical\nTripos in 1935/6
  ``could hear Sir Arthur Eddington's `Combination of\nObservations' in the Michaelmas
  Term, John Wishart's `Theory of\nStatistics' in the Lent Term and Harold Jeffreys'
  `Probability' in the\nEaster Term''. Indeed, in 1931/2 Maurice Bartlett took just
  these\ncourses, with the substitution of Fowler's `Statistical Mechanics' for\nJeffreys'
  course. \n In these days of student appraisal of lecturers etc. it is\ninteresting
  to note how common it seemed to be then that even\ninteresting material or brilliant
  intellects were accompanied by\nindifferent delivery. Some of us can take heart!
  Henry Daniels says of\nWishart that ``although the lectures themselves were not
  very well\ngiven, the material was very interesting'' and of Eddington\n``intriguing,
  and a little bizarre in some respects''. David Finney\nwrites of Jeffreys that his
  ``personal charm and enthusiasm did not\nprevent a steady decline in attendance''.
  Norman Bailey recalls\nJeffreys' lectures as being ``interesting but difficult,
  not least\nbecause from time to time Jeffreys would become inarticulate, simply\nwaving
  his arms while his brain moved on. When he rearticulated some\nminutes later in
  a perfectly lucid way it was apparent that we\nhad just missed what he had thought
  but had been unable to say in those\nprecious minutes''. \n One might also note
  the number of people, later to become\nprominent statisticians, who passed through
  Cambridge before\nthe foundation of the Statistical Laboratory: e.g. Yates, Bartlett,\nFinney,
  Maurice Kendall, Daniels, Cochran, Barnard, Cedric Smith and\nArmitage. \n Wishart
  was all the time endeavouring to promote the subject\nof statistics, and in fact
  to develop a programme in mathematical\nstatistics. In this he was not positively
  helped by the presence in\nCambridge of the two luminaries of the subject: Jeffreys
  and Fisher\n(who had been appointed Professor of Genetics in 1943). These two were\nof
  course accorded the respect of the Faculty of Mathematics, which\nWishart (based
  in Agriculture) was not, and Wishart had the ambition of\ncreating a working unit
  in statistics, which they did not. A lofty word\nfrom either of them could have
  a withering effect. \n However, the Faculty of Mathematics evidently felt the need\nfor
  some in-house strength in statistics, and in June 1938 advertised a\nUniversity
  Lecturership for which special consideration was to be given\n``to candidates with
  qualifications in the Theory of Statistics''.\nMaurice Bartlett was appointed. With
  a break for war-work he held the\npost until 1947. He lectured first largely in
  statistical theory, a\nsubject which was still evolving to the shape we would recognise
  today.\nBartlett combined ideas which were in general circulation with his own\nstatistical
  research (never recognised at its full pioneering worth).\nFrank Anscombe took notes
  of this course which Henry Daniels later\nread, to realise that ``Bartlett's approach
  to the subject was one that\nI sympathised with very much''. Violet Cane attended
  Maurice's\nstatistics course in 1939/40; she recalls finding it difficult at the\ntime,
  but realised later that she had (and still has!) a beautiful set\nof notes. Development
  of ideas was then the consideration, rather than\nrigour, so, when Dennis Lindley
  asked Bartlett to prove consistency of\nthe maximum likelihood estimate in class
  in 1946, this was a little\ncruel, as he himself admits. It was to be yet a while
  before a good\nproof was found by Wald (and, actually, by Lindley also). \n Maurice
  Bartlett is of course specially noted for his early\nand fundamental contributions
  to the theory of stochastic processes,\nbut it is first after his return from war
  work that he seems to have\ngiven a course on the subject , whose reach had still
  not been defined\nby a text. Bartlett's own text was one of the very first. The
  course\nincluded stationary time series and diffusion processes as special\ntopics.
  Norman Bailey attended it in 1946/7. He had trouble with time\nseries component,
  ``but the evolutionary process component was nothing\nshort of inspiring and had
  considerable importance for a lot of my\nlater applied research\". Wishart was also
  absent on national service\nduring the war years, when\nhis lectures were given
  by Dr J.O Irwin. Also, for at least one of\nthose years, mathematics undergraduates
  were required to come up during\nthe summer vacation to study electronics. Norman
  Bailey recalls\nenjoying the electronics much more than the statistics. Jeffreys
  also\nlater gave a short course in statistics, reputedly to Wishart's\nannoyance.\n\n
  Maurice Bartlett has kept copies of a three-way\ncorrespondence in 1943 between
  himself, Wishart and F.P. White, then\nSecretary of the Faculty Board of Mathematics.
  The former two were both\naway on national service; Bartlett writes from the Projectile\nDevelopment
  Establishment in Aberporth and Wishart from the Civil\nEstablishments Branch, Admiralty,
  Whitehall. White had written to all\nteachers of Mathematics in the University,
  including those on national\nservice, asking for their views on the pattern to be
  envisaged for the\nFaculty and its activities after the war. The Faculty still had
  no\ncollective physical accommodation, and had reported immediately before\nthe
  war that its most urgent need was ``the foundation of an Institute\nof Mathematics
  in close proximity to the Mathematical Laboratory and\nthe Philosophical Library''.
  \n Wishart was of course concerned with the position of\nStatistics; he plainly
  wished to escape from Agriculture, whose\ninterest in Statistics he considered too
  narrow, and very much wished\nto be associated with the projected Institute. On
  the other hand, he\nconsidered that Statistics should occupy a central position
  relative to\na number of Faculties, and sketched a case for the establishment of
  a\nseparate Faculty of Statistics. He nevertheless obviously regarded the\nFaculty
  of Mathematics as the best single peg on which to cling\nimmediately: ``Returning
  to the question of the Institute, an `embryo'\nschool of Statistics should certainly
  be housed therein''. He wished\nsuch a school to be open to members of any Faculty,
  but that its\nfundamental basis should be mathematical. \n Bartlett, already a member
  of the Faculty of Mathematics, was\nmore concerned with the provision of advanced
  courses. This meant Part\nIII courses; the Diploma was not yet envisaged. He was
  particularly\nconcerned to gain coverage for statistical (in fact, probabilistic)\nthinking
  in physical contexts, and for a new course on the `theory of\nstochastic processes',
  a topic then more familiar to some under the\nnames of `random functions' or `time
  series'. \n The demand for trained statisticians revealed during the war\nwas such
  that in 1946 a second University Lectureship was advertised,\nto which Henry Daniels
  was appointed. Wishart could now see his\nlong-nursed ambition of a Diploma in Statistics
  approaching\nrealisation. There were discussions about the content of the proposed\nDiploma.
  Maurice Bartlett recalls a degree of irritation when, during\nhis convalescence
  after an appendectomy in 1946, he was ``visited by\nWishart in the nursing-home
  to discuss the final draft Diploma\nregulations. These included the requirement
  to take a `field of\napplication', which was facilitated by the link with agriculture
  and\nwith genetics, following the appointment of Fisher during the war to\nthe genetics
  chair''. Bartlett himself missed out on the actual\nfoundation; in 1947 he left
  to become the first Professor of\nMathematical Statistics at Manchester. He was
  replaced in Cambridge\nlate that year by Frank Anscombe, from Rothamsted, who took
  up the post\nin January, 1948.\n3.\n1947--55 Creation and\nconfirmation\n In 1947
  the Faculty of Mathematics submitted a report to the\nGeneral Board proposing the
  establishment of a Diploma in Statistics\nand a Statistical Laboratory, the former
  to be awarded to\nmathematicians who had attended a course and been examined in\ntheoretical
  and applied statistics, and the latter ``to provide\nprimarily for the applied work
  in Statistics for students of this and\npossibly of other Faculties, including Diploma
  and Research Students''.\n\n This was considered by the General Board in a Report
  dated\n14th May 1947 ( Reporter , 1946-47, p. 1058),\nwhich indeed recommended the
  institution of a Diploma in Mathematical\nStatistics. The qualification `Mathematical'
  had been inserted to quell\nthe concerns of some other Faculty Boards that the statement
  in the\nDiploma document that the candidate had displayed a special knowledge\nof
  Statistics and of its application in a certain field might be taken\nto imply that
  he was an expert in that field. Wishart's lifelong\nenthusiasm for the teaching
  of statistics was now\nbeing rewarded, and his dreams of a properly-established
  unit being\nfulfilled. At a Royal Statistical Society discussion meeting on the\nTeaching
  of Statistics which he opened he was able to report with pride\nthat ``it is now
  possible for a mathematical graduate at the University\nof Cambridge to take a one-year
  Diploma in Statistics, during which\ntime he will be attached to a department where
  practical work is done,\nand will be examined finally on his work in the chosen
  field of\napplication'' ( J. Roy. Statist. Soc. A\n(1948) 111 , p. 227). This relates
  to an\ninteresting theme which emerges repeatedly in the discussion: the need\nrevealed
  during the war for statisticians with both practical and\nmathematical competence.\n\n
  Fisher commented on these developments with his usual blend\nof soundness and tetchiness;
  Edwards quotes passages from his\ndaughter's biography of him (Box, 1978). Fisher's
  own words at the end\nare from a letter to Wishart in which he agrees to serve on
  a small\nadvisory Committee for the Diploma. \n``After the diploma in mathematical
  statistics at Cambridge\nwas offered, to be awarded in recognition of one year's
  work in\nstatistics for graduates in mathematics, Fisher expressed the opinion\n1949
  that the regulations would only work well for those students who\nhad already taken
  mathematical statistics to Part III [of the\nMathematical Tripos] and who gave their
  year's work principally to\nunderstanding an applied field. It seemed to him\nthe
  attempt by means of a single-year course organised by the faculty\nof mathematics
  must necessarily fail to supply the real demand for\nstatistical training:\n` There
  is no wide or urgent demand for people\nwho will define methods of proof in set
  theory in the name of improving\nmathematical statistics. There is a widespread
  and urgent demand for\nmathematicians who understand that branch of mathematics
  known as\nmathematical statistics but who are capable also of recognising\nsituations
  in the real world to which such mathematics is applicable.'\n'' \n In 1950 the University
  did indeed amend the regulations for\nthe Diploma so that candidates without adequate
  mathematical\npreparation could be required to take two years over the course.\nDevelopments
  in the world of statistics over following years doubtless\nreinforced Fisher in
  his apprehensions. However, the Cambridge Diploma\nhas remained true to its initial
  conception: that the theoretical\ngrounding should be accompanied by close acquaintance
  with an applied\nfield and a testing investigation of data from that field. \n The
  General Board report quoted above passed over the\nquestion of the foundation of
  the Statistical Laboratory as an\ninstitution, but nevertheless discussed the provision
  of accommodation\nfor the Laboratory. Whether this was deliberate is unclear. The\nBuildings
  Syndicate had already indicated its conditional preparedness\nto ``recommend the
  assignment of a vacant site in Corn Exchange Street\nfor a temporary hut'' ( Reporter
  , 1946--47, p.\n1296). So, the Statistical Laboratory existed to the considerable\nextent
  that it was to have its own building, erected to its own\nspecifications submitted
  through the Faculty Board of Mathematics. More\nthan that, eloquent and conclusive,
  the structure when completed\ncarried a sign: `Statistical Laboratory'. The building
  was indeed a\n`hut': brick, single-storey, 70 feet by 24, with six working rooms,
  one\nof these being a larger `students' room' which served also for\nseminars. It
  faced on to St Andrew's Hill, a lane off Corn Exchange\nStreet which has since been
  obliterated by the Lion Yard car park. \n Dennis Lindley's recollection of the plan
  of the building and\nits eventual occupancy is sketched below. Dennis's impression
  is that\nDavid Cox used whatever room happened to be spare, although this\npresumably
  did not continue. He mentions also that Wishart's original\nplans made no allowances
  for lavatories. We see them here beside the\nboiler, of which more anon. \n \n For
  the session 1947/8 accommodation had perforce to be found\nin the School of Agriculture,
  classes being held there and in the Arts\nSchool. Frank Anscombe recalls Henry Daniels
  demonstrating his Bicycle\nTheory (a counterintuitive steering theory) outside the
  School of\nAgriculture building, so remembered with affection. However, in 1948\nthe
  staff (namely: Wishart, Daniels and Anscombe, with two computing\nassistants: Donald
  East and Ena Laurie) moved to St Andrew's Hill.\nWishart seems to have shifted from
  his quarters of 16 years in the\nSchool of Agriculture without hesitation. Bartlett
  comments: ``Wishart\nwas always keen to `push' statistics, and I don't know whether
  this\ncontributed to his falling-out in due course with Engledow, then\nDirector
  of the School of Agriculture, and that in turn to the creation\nof the Laboratory''.
  However, that the School of Agriculture had indeed\nbeen helpful is indicated by
  an acknowledgement in the report from the\nFaculty Board of Mathematics: ``In the
  past, a number of graduates in\nMathematics were encouraged to spend a fourth year
  in research and in\nequipping themselves as practising statisticians; the Board
  have been\nindebted to the Department of Agriculture for equipping a small\nlaboratory
  which provided the necessary facilities''. Such an origin\ncertainly made it natural
  to carry over the title `statistical\nlaboratory' which, while accepted at University
  College London as given\nby Galton, sat rather less naturally in a Faculty of Mathematics.
  \n In any case, John Wishart's `pushing' was to good effect.\nDennis Lindley was
  appointed in 1948 to a Demonstratorship and David\nCox in 1950 to an Assistant Lectureship.
  David Cox was well known to\nHenry Daniels; the two had worked together at the Wool
  Industries\nResearch Association -- one of those pragmatic institutions whose mark\nits
  sometime members happily bear for life (see Daniels and Whittle,\n1993). \n Ingram
  Olkin mentions, interestingly, that many of the\nsignificant departments of statistics
  in the USA were founded about\nthis time: Columbia and North Carolina in 1946, Stanford
  in 1948,\nBerkeley and Chicago around 1952 and Iowa State somewhat earlier.\nWishart
  set the content and tone of the teaching for the first term of\nthe Diploma; Violet
  Cane recalls feeling distinctly depressed and ready\nto quit. However, matters changed
  greatly for the better after\nChristmas, when Henry Daniels took over courses, and
  even more so after\nEaster (1948), when Frank Anscombe joined. Relief seems to have
  been\ngeneral; Norman Bailey writes that ``the General Mathematical\nStatistics
  course was given by Henry Daniels most brilliantly, as\nevinced by the resounding
  ovation he received at the end''. Norman\ntestifies to the meatiness of the course,
  as does John Nelder (Diploma\n1948/9). Design of Experiments was done thoroughly
  in those days. Frank\nAnscombe gave the course in John's year; he dragged the class
  through\nGalois fields in lectures and then asked candidates to design a\nrotation
  experiment in the practical exam.\n\n Henry Daniels has preserved his class lists
  from that time.\nFrom his Stats II course for 1947/8 we can identify the members
  of the\nfirst Diploma year and recognise many of them: N.T.J. Bailey, V.R.\nCane,
  J. Durbin, G.S. James, S.F. James, F.H.C. Marriott, P. Robinson,\nD.C. Shaw, N.J.
  Wang and L. Whitehouse. There are other familiar names\non the list; e.g. J.M. Hammersley,
  J.A. Nelder and E.S. Page from Part\nII of the Tripos, J.E. Drummond and J.C. Tanner
  from Part III and R.M.\nWilliams, a research student. C.R. Rao was also in Cambridge
  that year;\nas a research student with Fisher, but attending the Lab seminars. \n
  Dennis Lindley recalls some of the early Diploma examinations\nas being so difficult
  (in an attempt to impress the mathematicians with\nthe respectability of the subject)
  that they stumped staff as well as\nstudents, laying a supervision minefield for
  years to come. However,\nJim Durbin emphasises that, for the 1947/8 Diploma, the
  real problem,\nat least for him, was ``the seven-hour practical exam\n. We had 10
  students in a small room grinding away for dear life on\nBrunsviga manually-driven
  calculators all day long. The noise was\nhorrific and I found it so hard to concentrate
  I thought I'd probably\nmade a hash of it and hence, since Wishart was always going
  on about\nthe practical exam being the most important part of the whole affair,\nhad
  failed the Diploma. Fortunately, forbearance triumphed and I got a\nDistinction''.
  \n Both Henry and Violet speak of the particular vividness and\nexhilaration of
  the immediate post-war years, as people streamed back\nfrom war-work to resume their
  studies. This cohort represented a store\nof banked-up talent; individuals who valued
  the prospects that peace\nopened and met them with minds at once mature and fresh.
  One such was\nRobin Williams, who had been working on electromagnetic separation\nprocesses
  for the Manhattan Project, and who, despite encouragement to\nstay, chose rather
  to start research in statistics in Cambridge from\n1947. He was disappointed to
  find that his prospective supervisor,\nBartlett, had moved, to be replaced by Wishart.
  An appeal to Daniels\nresulted in his being passed on to Frank Anscombe for what
  turned out\nto be a rewarding collaboration (on the optimisation of experimental\nlay-out
  in the presence of spatial autocorrelation between plots).\nRobin recalls Anscombe
  and Daniels with warmth. \n Other research students from this time were Dennis Evans,\nAndrew
  Ehrenberg (both 1949/52), Wally Smith (1950/3) and Ewan Page\n(1951/4). Wally very
  nearly missed the return to graduate work in\nCambridge. He had just served three
  years in the Royal Navy and had now\narranged study, grant and marriage. However,
  with the advent of the\nKorean War, all releases were cancelled. Wally was appalled
  at the\nprospect of the collapse of his plans and urgently required a ``letter\nthat
  would convince the admirals that I would be serving the nation\nmuch better studying
  Statistics than drowning in the China Sea'' -\nWally could not swim. He found it
  difficult to convince anybody in\nCambridge of the urgency of his case, but at last
  wrung a missive from\nhis supervisor-to-be, Henry Daniels, which, reinforced by
  support from\nDr Stoneley of Pembroke, did the trick. \n Wally recalls the Stats
  Lab as he knew it: housed in the St\nAndrew's Hill hut. A cosy place, tiny offices,
  and a library whose\nexcellence he attributes to Lindley. The room containing the
  gas\nfurnace was off limits, with apparent good reason, as ``every week or\ntwo
  a considerable explosion would erupt''. The furnace was in the care\nof ``Donald
  East, who seemed, on first encounter, to be a little\ndistant and saturnine, but,
  on further acquaintance, proved to be\namiable and helpful, and very competent at
  his work (except, perhaps,\nfor those occasional lapses in the furnace room: once
  the detonation he\nproduced while making `necessary adjustments' caused a bang of
  many\ndecibels, and I do believe the doors rattled, while he came out\nbackwards
  from the furnace room at high velocity)''. \n Something has been said of lecturing
  styles; Wally's\npen-pictures are too good not to reproduce in full.\n``Wishart
  was actually very friendly to me, and in truth I\nliked him. I was in awe of someone
  who had a distribution named after\nhim, and especially one whose derivation was
  so dreadfully awkward. He\nlectured very rapidly in a high-pitched squeaky voice
  with a Scottish\naccent, and wrote very neat notes in very small writing...made
  me think\nof an economical user of postcards, getting as much information home as\nhe
  could for the least postage.\n``Henry Daniels' course was on Stochastic Processes,
  and\nwas the one in which I had far and away the most interest, and I very\nmuch
  enjoyed it. Though I confess that, even to this day, I often feel\nwhen I am listening
  to Henry lecture that he is constantly hinting in a\nmysterious and barely verbal
  way, as an undercurrent to what he is\nactually saying, that there is a very subtle
  implication or explanation\nor ramification...which I am far to dumb or unsubtle
  to understand.\n``Frank Anscombe...had such a debonair gentlemanly way of\naddressing
  the class; we were all damn good types meeting in the\nclub-room for a jolly good
  chat about factorial experiments or\nwhatever, don't you know; and he had worked
  the material out with such\npainstaking detail.''\n\n Wally refers to Dennis Lindley
  and David Cox repeatedly with\nunreserved gratitude and respect. David made ``everything
  he discussed\nseem so very very easy and straightforward. One kicked oneself at
  being\nso stupid as to need any instruction at all on such a seemingly trivial\nmatter.''
  Dennis's purple hectographed notes on the Kolmogorov\ntreatment of probability summarised
  ``the most important for me of all\nthe lectures I ever attended as a graduate student''.
  \n Wally entered research with some travail. ``Henry sent me\nover the road to the
  Zoology lab to work with a research man called\nJ.W.S. Pringle who was obtaining
  an abundance of photographic records\nof the nerve response of giant South American
  cockroaches. He would pin\n(literally) the poor but unphotogenic creature to a large
  block of wax,\nplunge an electrode somewhere into its brain, and then tickle its
  leg\nwith a camel-hair brush...I had little knowledge of the chemistry of\nnerve
  transmission and so on. Thus the months in which I should have\nbeen mastering measure
  theory and semi-groups and Fourier analysis and\nall those other good worthwhile
  things, I was floundering around trying\nto teach myself the rudiments of subjects
  I found very unattractive.'' \n Before Wally managed to obtain relief from the cockroach
  Ewan\nPage introduced him to EDSAC, of which both were then early users.\nRelief
  came via Dennis Lindley, who was then in the middle of his\nclassic work on queues.
  Wally was fascinated by the Wiener-Hopf\narguments. When Henry took a sabbatical
  in Chicago in 1952 Wally was\nreassigned to David Cox, ``the two years of work on
  cockroaches went\nout the window'' and Fourier ideas, Wiener-Hopf theory and renewal\nprocesses
  came in. Ewan Page was supervised by Frank Anscombe, of whom\nhe speaks with the\nsame
  warmth as does Robin Williams. `Inspirational' he says, with the\ncapacity to `let
  his mind wander' as they discussed problems. When\nFrank took sabbatical leave in
  Princeton 1953/4 Ewan was taken over by\nDavid Cox, who warned him: ``I don't have
  many ideas; I hope you don't\nwant me to give you an idea!''.\n\n Wally and Ewan
  together wrote a pools forecasting guide one\nweekend, which they tried to publish,
  without success. However, Ewan\nscored one of the historic triumphs of the Lab the
  following year\n(1953) when, using random numbers from the Fisher and Yates statistical\ntables,
  he won a First Division treble chance. According to a\nfinancially-straitened Wally,
  ``enough in those days to buy a modest\nhouse and a modest new car (if one chose)''.
  \n Ewan tells how he was in Dennis Lindley's room one day,\ndiscussing a change-point
  problem on the board, when Wishart brought in\nA.C. Aitken. Aitken was of course
  famed for his feats of memory, and,\nsome considerable time later at a seminar in
  Edinburgh, Ewan challenged\nhim to recall what had been on the board that day. Aitken
  obliged. \n Courses were of course given for the Mathematical Tripos as\nwell as
  for the Diploma. Anscombe started and Lindley then developed\nthe first Part II
  course in probability. It had to be entitled `Random\nvariables', however -- Jeffreys
  objected to use of the term\n`Probability', which he reserved to describe his own
  brand of Bayesian\ninference. \n In 1953 the reality of the Laboratory became formally\nrecognised.
  Regulations for the Statistical Laboratory, which covered\nalso the post of Director,
  were proposed by the Faculty Board of\nMathematics in October 1952 ( Reporter, 1952-53,\np.
  810) and approved by the University on 21st March, 1953. In April\n1953 J. Wishart,
  still a Reader in Statistics with primary appointment\nin the Faculty of Agriculture,
  was appointed Director. \n Colleagues from that period give Wishart credit for the\nsingle-mindedness
  which at last brought the Diploma and the Laboratory\nto being. They give him less
  credit for sensitivity and tact. He would\nintroduce a member of the Lab staff to
  a visitor as ``My assistant'' -\nsave in the case of David Cox. Youth still rested
  so clearly on David\nthat he was more appropriately introduced as ``My student''.
  \n All unknowing, the Statistical Laboratory was now at a zenith\nit would not hold
  for long and would not reach again for many years -\nsome would say `never', in
  that the character of those times will not\nrecur. It was fully set up, with a staff
  consisting of a Reader\n(Wishart), three University Lecturers (Anscombe and Daniels
  with a\nrecently-promoted Lindley) and one Assistant Lecturer (Cox) plus\ncomputing
  staff. It set the pattern and the standard for departments of\nstatistics throughout
  the country. In particular, one can say that the\nDiploma was the model for all
  the postgraduate courses in statistics\nwhich have been set up since. The Diploma
  itself was thriving, and its\nproducts occupied many of the key statistical posts
  in the country,\nuniversity posts among them. The staff were leading in research
  in\ntheir respective fields: Daniels in stochastic processes,\nposition-finding,
  steepest descents and components of variance,\nAnscombe in the design of experiments
  and sequential analysis, Lindley\nin inference and decision theory, and Cox in the
  design of experiments,\nsequential estimation, renewal theory and point processes.
  Wally Smith\nwas just completing his Ph.D. in a late rush: he had developed insights\ninto
  the analytic theory of renewal processes and the like. He and\nDavid Cox went on
  to collaborate fruitfully. \n All the staff were heavily engaged in consultation
  for other\nUniversity departments, regarded as one of the prime functions of the\nLab.
  Lindley recalls: ``In common with other members of the Lab I did\nsome applied work,
  almost essential in order to provide facilities for\nthe Diploma candidates. The
  one I enjoyed most was for Rothschild on\nthe movement of sperm, giving a process
  that was not Markov of any\norder''. The Lab also had close relations with the statisticians
  placed\nin other departments, e.g. Norman Bailey in Medicine, Violet Cane in\nPsychology,
  and Colin Campbell in Agriculture. Norman Bailey held a\npost as Statistician to
  the Cambridge Medical School 1948/52; he was\nsucceeded first by Wally Smith and
  then by Bob Carpenter. He speaks\nfeelingly of the extent to which these lone statisticians
  relied on the\nStatistical Laboratory for back-up and advice when in need. He also\nwonders
  whether this increasing dispersion of applied statistics over\nother departments
  may not, in the course of time, have had some\nconsequences for the central focus.
  \n The Faculty recognised the function of the Statistical\nLaboratory, in that so
  many mathematics graduates found employment in\nstatistics, and doubtless recognised
  the Lab's worth, in that it\nconsidered its statisticians better than other peoples'
  statisticians.\nRecognition of the quality of the subject as such was slow to come,\nhowever,
  and it was a source of chagrin, particularly to senior members\nof the Laboratory,
  that their status and function were not acknowledged\nby the offer of a college
  fellowship. Indeed, no statistician was a\ncollege fellow at that time; not even
  Wishart, who had been a Reader\nfor 22 years. \n On the other hand, the `problem
  of the non-fellows' was by no\nmeans particular to the statisticians. The Bridges
  Report (Reporter\n13/3/1962, p.1075) found that in 1961 only some 500-odd out of
  950\nUniversity Teaching Officers and equivalent held fellowships. \n William Jackson
  Hall spent the year 1953/4 in the Lab as a\nFulbright Scholar, working on his dissertation
  for the University of\nNorth Carolina. He remembers particularly Dennis Lindley's
  good\nresearch advice, the clouds of pipe-smoke which Henry Daniels generated\nin
  seminars and, of course, Ewan Page's pools win. \n Robert Curnow took the Diploma
  in 1954/5, the same year as\nMaurice Priestley and Mervyn Stone. The Brunsviga lives
  in his memory,\ntoo, as does the occasion when David Cox became vexed by the time
  the\nclass took to invert a 7 ? 7 matrix on it. He also recalls Wishart's\ncourse
  on distributions, which stopped at the exciting part: evaluation\nof the fourth
  moment of the fifth cumulant. Ewan Page likewise shudders\nat the memory of the
  `acres' of pattern coefficient calculations\nrequired for these evaluations. \n
  An innovation accompanying the change in status in 1953 was\nthe annual photograph
  of current Laboratory members: staff, computing\nand secretarial staff, research
  and Diploma students. The rows of these\nphotographs on the Laboratory walls fascinate
  all who call. They\nprovide quite the quickest way of determining who was in the
  Lab when,\nbut also constitute an invaluable and evocative historical record. They\nmanifest
  something which has been evident from those days: a sense of\nLaboratory identity
  and character, an esprit de corps which has\npersisted through weal and woe.\n4.\n1955--61
  Disaster and diaspora\n In 1955 the Laboratory suffered a serious setback when David\nCox's
  appointment was not renewed. A University Assistant Lectureship\nwas a purely probationary
  appointment; for three years in the first\ninstance, extendable at most to five.
  It was in fact merely a stage in\nan open competition for one of the restricted
  number of lectureships; a\ncompetition in which the statisticians felt that they
  carried a\nhandicap, especially relative to the pure mathematicians. In this case\nthe
  post indeed went to a pure mathematician. \n Nevertheless, David Cox was then regarded
  by the statistical\nworld as being of exceptional quality; a view which he has since\nconfirmed
  by becoming the leading figure in British statistics in his\ngeneration, powerfully
  bridging probability models, theoretical and\napplied statistics, and repeatedly
  honoured overseas. That the Faculty\nshould not recognise this seemed unjust and
  inexplicable; an affront to\nboth him and the subject. David himself has put the
  matter behind him;\nit is others who still feel outrage. Norman Bailey writes: ``Feelings\nwere
  very strong, both amongst members of the Statistical Laboratory\nitself and peripheral
  statisticians in other University departments,\nthat the growing and indeed talented
  mathematical statistical nucleus\nwas not being properly recognised, and that this
  was compounded by no\noffer of college fellowships. I believe that this led to an
  inevitable\ndiaspora in the years up to around 1957.'' \n The loss of the youngest
  staff member was then followed, in a\nmost curious way, by the loss of the oldest.
  In 1956 John Wishart was\nin Mexico, on leave. In July news came through that he
  had drowned\nwhile bathing in the sea off Acapulco. \n Such events are not only
  tragic in themselves; they are\nsudden and shattering. Henry Daniels, deputising
  for Wishart during the\nlatter's leave, had now to wind up Wishart's affairs and
  take charge of\nthe Lab as Acting Director. Frank Anscombe left shortly after for
  a\npost at Princeton, moving later to Yale. In the following year, 1957,\nHenry
  Daniels himself left to take up the Chair of Mathematical\nStatistics at Birmingham.
  \n Of the five 1955 members of the academic staff of the Lab\nonly one then remained
  in October, 1957: Dennis Lindley. On him fell\nthe task of reviving the fortunes
  of the Lab; he was appointed\nDirector. The staff situation had been somewhat shored
  up, in that\nWally Smith had been appointed to a ULship in 1956, replacing Frank\nAnscombe.
  However, he could return to the UK first at the beginning of\n1957. Wally had been
  rather unsettled (a `yo-yo', says Ewan Page) since\ncompleting his Ph.D. He had
  held the post in the Medical School at\nFenner's 1953/4. Earlier meetings with American
  visitors to Cambridge\n(Sam Wilks, Harold Hotelling, Leo Goodman, Jimmy Savage)
  had opened his\neyes. Far from showing the brashness believed to be the American\ncharacteristic,
  they exemplified ``the acme of gentlemanly courtesy''\nand a ``quiet respectfulness''
  not to be found in the RSS Research\nSection meetings, for example. So, when offered
  an attractive post at\nChapel Hill in 1954, he had taken it, although only after
  three months'\nindecision and then with many a backward glance to the UK. Ewan Page\nrecalls
  his plaint: ``Don't forget me so quickly!''. In 1956 he took\nthe chance to return
  to a full Lectureship in Cambridge. \n After Henry's departure in the summer of
  1957 only Dennis and\nWally were left to carry the full burden of the Lab's teaching
  and\nactivity. Every moment of day and evening was committed; a desperate\ntime,
  although Wally also recalls it as exhilarating. However, Wally\nwas dispirited by
  what Neyman had characterised as the `second-class\ncitizen' status of the statisticians
  in Cambridge, and found the social\nlife cold or absent compared with the friendliness
  and informality of\nChapel Hill. What must have been a difficult decision and a
  time of\ndeep disillusion is only hinted at in Dennis Lindley's brief\nrecollection:
  ``Wally and Mary paid a visit to our house on the day the\nRussians launched the
  first Sputnik. Neyman and Elizabeth Scott were\nalso there. They had to cycle out
  to our house in the rain. They\ndecided a car in sunny Chapel Hill was better and
  left soon after.''\nThey left in summer, 1958, in fact, although often to return
  in body,\nand perhaps more often in spirit. Wally never found it easy; his lament\nfor
  the days that had passed should be quoted in full.\n``I do not think that, outside
  the blitz, I have lived, or\nwill ever again live, through such heroic times as
  those days seemed to\nbe, in retrospect, when Dennis and I alone held the fort.
  And we did it.\n``The Statistical Laboratory building is long gone. Smashed\ndown.
  The site is now buried in a large parking garage. [The Lion Yard\ncar park.] A few
  years ago I walked into that garage and tried to\nestimate where my office had been;
  where I had stood giving that first\nscary seminar talk; where the library had stood,
  in which I had done so\nmuch studying and learnt so much, where David Cox first
  told me what a\nMartingale was (I wonder if he had it right?). Various annoyed\nmotorists
  hooted at me, and I had to dodge cars constantly. I should\nhave picked a quieter
  time. But it was all footling. I could not\nrecapture any of it.''\n\n Dennis had
  a desperate task to keep the Lab going, although\nhe took it evenly enough. There
  were two immediate recruitments; Morris\nWalker took up a University Lectureship
  in early 1958 (replacing Henry\nDaniels) and Peter Whittle in late 1959 (replacing
  Wally Smith).\nWhittle had no previous Cambridge connection at all, and Lindley
  had to\npress the Faculty hard to secure the appointment, even resorting to the\nthen
  unheard-of extravagance of telephoning New Zealand. In his turn,\nit took Whittle
  time to become aware of the cross-currents created by\nevents, realised and incipient.
  Some closer personal impressions of\nthese and later years at the Laboratory are
  given in Whittle (1994). \n The Laboratory left St Andrew's Hill in 1958. Thanks
  to some\nuncharacteristic maladroitness of the chemists it was given quarters in\nthe
  basement of the new Chemistry Building in Lensfield Road. Parquet\nfloors and lofty
  ceilings provided a degree of state unimaginable, at\nany time, to the Faculty of
  Mathematics. \n As mentioned, L.J. Savage had already visited Cambridge, in\n1952.
  Dennis Lindley developed a closer contact with him while on\nsabbatical in Chicago
  in 1954, and became impressed by his ideas in a\nfashion which was to prove lasting.
  Savage again visited Cambridge for\nthe summer of 1958 and briefly in 1959. \n Despite
  the reduction in its fortunes, the Lab still had a\nwonderful feeling of camaraderie
  - perhaps because staff and graduate\nstudents were so close in age. The names of
  the research students from\nthat time are now familiar: Ann Mitchell, John Bather,
  John Kingman,\nBob Loynes, Roger Miles, and Hilton Miller. Mervyn Stone had just\ncompleted.
  Staff and students seemed always to be adjourning to the\nSpread Eagle together
  to celebrate the augmentation of someone's\nfamily. \n Donald East was the principal
  member of the computing staff,\nsurviving from the days in Agriculture, when he
  had acted virtually as\nWishart's secretary. He used an electromechanical Marchant,
  Dennis\nLindley a Facit. The Diploma students at that time were still using the\nmanual
  Brunsvigas of which Jim Durbin spoke; now museum pieces which\nhave unfortunately
  been disposed of. (However, Violet Cane possesses\none, and Jeffreys' machines are
  displayed in DAMTP.) \n Dennis Lindley left to take up a new chair at Aberystwyth
  in\n1960. Donald East went too, changing his hobby from gardening to golf.\nThis
  was the first chair in statistics which had been created in the UK\nfor several
  years and there was little reason to expect that it would\nbe followed at all soon
  by others. Dennis also found the Aberystwyth\nprospect attractive. In fact, the
  expansion of the sixties was about to\nballoon, and there was a quickening even
  in Cambridge. The possible\nestablishment of a chair of statistics, mooted already
  in 1953, was now\nbeing discussed more definitely in the Faculty, and colleges were\nbeginning
  to make cautious overtures to Laboratory staff. \n The disintegration of the `Wishart'
  Laboratory should perhaps\nnot be seen as a disaster, but as the natural fruiting
  of success. The\nLaboratory had reached a stage of maturity; that its members should
  be\ndispersed over other universities was very likely for the general good.\nThe
  event itself that triggered that dispersal was, of course, tragic. \n Lindley, the
  last of the old guard, had a considerable\ninfluence - broadening, innovatory and
  lasting - on the activity of the\nLaboratory. The contribution he then made to queueing
  theory is a\nclassic of applied probability, which to this day generates new work.\nHis
  Bayesian enthusiasms are associated with his championing of the\nideas of L.J. Savage
  and B. de Finetti, but they also led him to\ndecision theory and some of the classic
  decision problems. This latter\ninterest may be seen as the germ of some of the
  courses in `applicable\nmathematics' which were later to develop. A point of interest:
  Dennis's\nundergraduate supervisor had been Besicovitch, himself a student of\nMarkov,
  so Dennis could claim Markov as his academic grandsire. \n Violet Cane was appointed
  UL in 1960 to replace Dennis.\nHowever, Peter Whittle left the next year to succeed
  Maurice Bartlett\nin the Chair of Mathematical Statistics at Manchester. The Lab\nphotograph
  for 1961/2 is graphic: the total group is now reduced to a\nhandful. Morris Walker,
  taking his turn as Acting Director, peers\nanxiously into the future. \n Indeed,
  the future of the Statistical Laboratory had been\nunder consideration for some
  time; deliberations whose murmur seemed,\nhowever, not to reach the Lab itself. \n5.\n1961--66
  The Chair of Mathematical Statistics; Resurgence\n The buffets which the Laboratory
  had suffered since 1956 had\nbrought the Faculty to the realisation that its teaching
  of statistics\ncould be stabilised only by the creation of a senior post in the\nFaculty:
  a Chair of Statistics. Outside Cambridge, the absence of such\na chair was regarded
  as frankly anomalous. \n The future form envisaged for the Laboratory was bound
  up\nwith the structure of the Faculty itself, which was at that time\npreparing
  to divide into the two existing departments. A 1958 Report of\nthe Faculty Board
  to the General Board ( Reporter,\n1958--9, p. 1375) proposed the establishment of
  a Department of\nTheoretical Statistics and Applied Mathematics, and added ``As
  regards\nthe Statistical Laboratory, its ultimate status is bound up with the\npossible
  establishment of a Chair of Mathematical Statistics. It may\nwell be appropriate
  to convert the Statistical Laboratory into a\nDepartment once such a Chair exists,
  but it would be premature to do so\nnow''. \n The formal record is unrevealing on
  the question of whether\nthe true initiative for the establishment of a chair came
  from the\nUniversity itself, but one contributor to this account is in no doubt.\n``In
  spite of pressure from Wishart, Lindley, the RSS and probably\nothers, Cambridge
  University declined to create a Chair of Statistics.\nThe RSS Council, probably
  at Lindley's instigation, decided in disgust\nto try and raise enough money to endow
  a chair. They gave the job to\nthe next President, Maurice Kendall. At first he
  was a bit put out at\nbeing asked to raise a huge amount of money for another\nuniversity
  at a time when he was hard at work drumming up support for\nstatistics at LSE, but
  then he threw himself into the task with\ncharacteristic generosity and energy and
  was brilliantly successful.'' \n The formal records are blander. The Faculty Board's
  passing\nmention of a Chair quoted above became a firm proposal from the Faculty\nof
  Mathematics; this is referred to in a report from the Council of the\nSenate to
  the University in June 1960 ( Reporter,\n1959-60, p. 1684) The establishment of
  a chair was considered desirable\n``both because of the long association of the
  University with advances\nin Mathematical Statistics and the high calibre of Cambridge\nmathematical
  students, and because...a number of other Faculties who\ncall upon the services
  of the Statistical Laboratory would warmly\nwelcome it''. ``The [General] Board
  have said that they now have reason\nto believe that, by appealing to certain persons
  and bodies interested\nin the theory and application of the study of statistics,
  it may be\npossible to secure all or a large part of the funds necessary to\nmaintain
  the Chair.'' \n The `reason' mentioned by the General Board was the\npreparedness
  of the Council of Royal Statistical Society to launch an\nappeal to raise money
  for the chair. According to the RSS itself, it\nhad been approached by the Faculty
  of Mathematics with a request that\nit ``sponsor an appeal...'' (see J. Roy. Statist.
  Soc. A\n(1961) 124, p. 562). The Society saw this\nas a good cause and put its full
  weight behind the venture. Its\nPresident, Dr Maurice Kendall, was indeed outstandingly
  active in\npressing the appeal, which by 1961 had been brought to a successful\nconclusion.
  The contributing companies and banks are listed in J.\nRoy. Statist. Soc. A (1962)
  125\n, p. 616. \n The University had agreed to the Council of the Senate's\nproposal.
  In October 1961 the Council announced the successful\ncompletion of the appeal (
  Reporter , 1961--2, p.\n326); it recommended the establishment of the Professorship
  and that\nthe Professor should be ex officio Director of\nthe Statistical Laboratory,
  whose ``establishment on a firm basis'' the\nFaculty Board of Mathematics regarded
  ``as a matter of great\nimportance''. The University accepted these recommendations
  without\ncomment. \n The title of the Professorship corresponded to that of the\nDiploma.
  The duties of the Professor were not prescribed by any\nordinance, but the origins
  of the Laboratory, the involvement of the\nRoyal Statistical Society and the appeal
  to `persons and bodies\ninterested in the theory and application of the study of
  statistics'\nmade clear the intention. \n The Electors to the new Chair met in May
  1962 and elected\nDavid Kendall to the post; he took up duties in October of that
  year. \n That David Kendall should have been elected was not an\nentirely unexpected
  outcome, his personal claims on grounds of quality\nbeing overwhelming. It was a
  maverick outcome, however, in that David\nwas much more obviously a probabilist
  -- and at that time of fairly\npure leanings -- than a statistician. The matter
  has been debated then\nand since, not least because it may be argued that the appointment
  set\na precedent for the two subsequent elections to the same post. One\npoint that
  must be made is that the Board of Electors was a balanced\none (with the RSS represented
  by its President, Maurice Kendall), well\naware of the nature of the case that had
  been made both for the post\nand for the appeal which supported it, and the Board
  certainly\nconsidered all factors in reaching its decision. An interesting light\nis
  thrown by Dennis Lindley. He writes that, at the time when he was\nconsidering whether
  or not to apply for the Aberystwyth post, ``Maurice\nKendall was well-advanced in
  his appeal for money for a chair at\nCambridge, and had politely made clear to me
  that David Kendall would\nget it''. The coincidence of surnames is fortuitous --
  Maurice and\nDavid are unrelated -- so Maurice's intention, typically robust, was\ndisinterest
  itself. The quotation makes clear that Maurice was not\nambushed by other Electors,
  although another account represents this\nrather as a reluctant acceptance of the
  fact that David Kendall was\nintrinsically the strongest candidate. \n More to the
  point, one can maintain that David Kendall\nsubsequently met the criticisms, in
  that he became a statistician in\nhis own individual way, and an ingenious and enthusiastic
  one. In\naddition to his continuing work in pure probability (Markov processes,\nstochastic
  analysis and geometry and random sets) and applied\nprobability models (bird navigation,
  structure of the retina, epidemic\nwaves and rumours) he became deeply interested
  in the inference and\nreconstruction problems of archaeology, such as grave sequencing,
  the\nreconstruction of local maps from information on contiguity etc., and\nthe
  recognition of regularities such as quanta of measurement and the\nplacement patterns
  of standing stones. These applications all had a\nparticular sense of intangibility,
  and were in fact pioneering and\nadvanced examples of the analysis of latent variable
  models. \n David Kendall also `strove for statistics' (in David\nMcLaren's phrase)
  at the operational level. he made efforts to\nestablish contacts with statisticians
  in applied posts, such as Colin\nCampbell and Bob Carpenter; he secured David McLaren
  (who had joined\nthe group from Manchester as a research student), appointment as
  a\nsenior Assistant in research (later an Assistant Director of Research),\nwith
  partial responsibility for statistical consulting, he set up a\ncourse on inference
  in Part IB and pioneered the use of TITAN in the\nLab. \n David's appointment brought
  one immediate political benefit\nto the Laboratory; the mathematicians recognised
  David as one of their\nown, with the consequence that the standing in the Faculty
  which the\nLaboratory had earned but not received was now granted overnight. John\nKingman,
  now a Fellow of Pembroke and a member of the Lab, was also\ngreatly influenced in
  bringing about change in attitude. Harold\nDavenport's reported reaction to the
  appointment was: ``Eeh, I did\nworry about who we might get, but eeh, we got a Professor
  of Statistics\nwho knows about lattice points!''. The colleges opened their doors
  and,\nindeed, from that time there has generally been competition to secure\nthe
  services of Laboratory staff as teaching fellows. \n This rapport brought other
  consequences, however. Given the\nwill, the Laboratory could indeed have become
  a separate department.\nHowever, it would then have been expected to unify of statistics
  in the\nUniversity, so reversing the dispersion Norman Bailey mentions. In\nparticular,
  it would have been expected to absorb the statisticians\nrather loosely attached
  to other Faculties such as Agriculture and\nMedicine and probably to provide service
  teaching -- teaching for\nFaculties other than Mathematics. Such a course would
  have meant an\nincrease in role but a change in character; there are obvious arguments\nboth
  for and against it. In the event, the Laboratory joined the pure\nmathematicians
  to constitute the existing Department of Pure\nMathematics and Mathematical Statistics
  (DPMMS). \n The Lab was still housed in the basement of the Chemistry\nBuilding
  when David arrived in 1962. It was honoured in the first term\nby a courtesy call
  from Fisher. He was carrying a stout stick; John\nKingman later affected to believe
  that this was for the administration\nof a cudgelling in case of displeasure. In
  fact, the occasion seems to\nhave been totally amicable, ending in lunch. \n John
  may be playing down his own doughtiness; david McLaren\nrecalls the seminar which
  Fisher had given in Cambridge the previous\nsummer. in David's words ``A very recent
  graduate of the Diploma, I\narrived rather too promptly, when Fisher was already
  on his feet.\nHowever, he insisted on shaking my hand most warmly; presumably his\nshort
  sight prevented him from being sure that I was not the\nVice-Chancellor\". \n Fisher's
  topic was `Sampling the reference set'. John Kingman\nbravely took issue with some
  of this, advancing to the blackboard to\ndemonstrate some counter-argument. Fisher
  started swinging his stick in\na most menacing way, not amicable at all. Eventually
  he dismissed John\nby demanding \"What does it matter if the mouse is a Unitarian?\".\"
  \n In 1964 the whole Faculty was concentrated at the former\nPrinting House in Mill
  Lane, rendered vacant by the University Press's\nmove to new premises. The Statistical
  Laboratory moved with the rest of\nDPMMS into the warehouse building. One may now
  begin to use the present\ntense. The Mill Lane building is not an elegant one, but
  it is\nconveniently sited and has served the Department well. Strongly and\nsquatly
  built around a steel frame with a full-plan basement, it rather\nincongruously suggests
  a war-time bunker. The ground is weak near the\nsurface of the river bank; the bridging
  of the Cam at this point has\nhistorically presented a civil engineering challenge.
  As a consequence,\nthe Pure wing (the `old warehouse') of the L-shaped building
  tends to\nslip away from the Statistical wing (the `new warehouse'), giving rise\nto
  the `Daniels fault' at the junction -- a vertical crack which indeed\nstaggers the
  window of Henry Daniels' present room. \n John Kingman accompanied David from Oxford
  in 1962, as a UAL.\nHe was upgraded to UL from April, 1964, at the end of which
  year he\nleft for a term's sabbatical and a post in Brighton. It was immediately\nbefore
  his departure and before the move to Mill Lane that John\nrendered his last great
  service to the Lab. John was a very junior\nmember of the committee concerned with
  allocation of space in the Mill\nLane building; he saw reconnoitre as his first
  necessity. ``The credit\nfor getting into the warehouse lies with Violet, who had
  a friend\n(whose name I had better suppress) in the Press. Thus Violet and I got\ninto
  the warehouse, by then cleared of paper but having no internal\nwalls except that
  between the old and the new warehouses. With its iron\nstanchions holding up the
  heavy floors it was like being on a C19th\nsailing ship.'' However, it turned out
  that the appointed Master of the\nvessel (Sir William Hodge) had already provisionally
  consigned the\nStatistical Laboratory to the bilges (the basement -- commodious
  but\ndismal). Thither it would indeed have been cast had not the brave cabin\nboy
  (John Kingman) spoken up, sturdily enough that he secured for the\nLab all of the
  upper two decks (the upper two floors of the new\nwarehouse) aft of the sole bulkhead
  (the aforesaid wall). John now had\na free hand in the partitioning of this space.
  Perhaps in reaction to\nthe depths into which he had peered, he was particularly
  insistent that\nthere should be a large common-room with many soft chairs and no\nblackboards.
  \n When David Kendall arrived in 1962 the staff consisted just\nof Violet Cane and
  Morris Walker, with now the addition of John\nKingman. On this slight but genetically-rich
  base the Laboratory began\nto develop life again, in somewhat mutated form. Alfred
  R?nyi (soon to\ndie tragically early) was a visitor in 1963/4 and Jessie McWilliams,\nJoe
  Kruskal and Ronald Pyke in 1964/5. Through his connections with the\nAtlas Laboratory
  at Harwell David managed to arrange an Atlas\nFellowship at Churchill. John Hartigan
  held this in 1963/4 and helped\nout with lecturing (while Morris Walker was on sabbatical
  leave in\nAustralia). Roy Hodson held it for a time after that -- David was by\nthis
  time well into his archaeological phase. David was elected FRS in\n1964. In that
  year John Kingman left for Brighton and was replaced by\nBob Loynes, from Manchester.
  Bob Bechofer, who visited in 1966/7, was\nprevailed upon to lecture. When leaving
  he confided to David, in\namiable honesty: ``Your statistics is terrible!''. \n
  It is not practicable to follow the passage of individual\nresearch students in
  the same detail as that of staff. What is natural\nis to recall the members of the
  research-student group at the times -\nquite definite - when this was especially
  flourishing. Some notable\nsingletons are then likely to be missed; they should
  be sure that they\nare remembered. \n The research students played a particular
  role during these\nrecovery years in giving the group substance; David McLaren,
  Nick\nBingham, Daryl Daley, Charles Goldie, John Haigh, Peter Lee, David\nMannion,
  and Jane Speakman speak to us from the photographs. \n David Williams performed
  his first transit of the Lab in\n1966/7, when he held a Research Fellowship at Clare.
  He recurs. Nick\nBingham recalls him from that time as ``a force of nature -\nunforgettable
  for linguistic as well as mathematical reasons''.\n6.\n1966--72: The Churchill Chair;\nRedefinition\n
  There was a continuing concern to bring up the Lab's strength\nand, in particular,
  to restore its historic strength in statistics.\nEsso Petroleum Ltd seemed disposed
  to be helpful, and David Kendall had\nconversations with Leo Govier of that firm.
  Initial suggestions were\nmodest: that support might be provided for a Diploma student.
  A year or\nmore of discussion, back-reference and variation led to something\nstartingly
  more ambitious: Esso generously endowed the Churchill Chair\nin the Mathematics
  of Operations Research. This was to be located in\nthe Faculty of Mathematics; more
  specifically, in the Statistical\nLaboratory. \n The new chair was advertised in
  1966. Peter Whittle was\nelected to the post in August of that year and took up
  duties in July\n1967. The number of people in the UK who might be said to be\nknowledgeable
  in the mathematics of OR was small, but Whittle's\nincreasing interest in optimisation
  was deemed sufficiently qualifying,\nand made the move an appropriate one as far
  as he was concerned. \n There may have been an expectation in some quarters that
  the\nnew professor would be, effectively, a professor of statistics, so\nrestoring
  the desired balance. However, Whittle saw the matter in a\nmore literal light. For
  one thing, Esso's intention was clearly that\nthe post should be in operational
  research. But, more than that,\nWhittle considered that what needed development
  was, not just\nnarrow-sense operational research, but the whole area for which there\nis
  still no good name, but which is variously called `applicable\nmathematics' or `non-physical
  applied mathematics'. This includes, for\nexample, probability, statistics, optimisation,
  systems theory, game\ntheory and those aspects of disciplines such as control theory,\ncommunication
  theory and mathematical economics which might be pursued\nby someone technically
  based in probability and optimisation.\nDevelopments in the USA since the war have
  demonstrated, not only the\npractical importance of these topics, but also the depth
  and coherence\nof the theory they generate. \n Surprisingly, Cambridge was ready
  for these developments.\nBoth students and other Faculties had been pressing the
  Faculty of\nMathematics to modernise its coverage in precisely these areas, and
  the\nFaculty had conceded the case. So, the proposal of new Part II courses\n(in
  convex optimisation, dynamic optimisation and statistical\ncommunication theory,
  as it turned out) was welcomed, rather than met\nwith the incredulity and resistance
  which precedent would have led one\nto expect. The new courses had a chequered beginning,
  but ultimately\ntook shape and became accepted components of the Tripos. One may
  say\nthat the optimisation courses have not prospered as they should, but\nthe changes
  in courses and staff anticipated for 1994 promise\nregeneration. \n Statisticians
  outside Cambridge may have watched the partial\ndisplacement of statistics in Cambridge
  by probability and\noptimisation, etc. with some dismay, seeing this as an abandonment
  of\nhonourable traditions or a snobbish mathematical elitism. They could\nnot be
  more wrong. There is surely substance in the view that the\ncomplacency lay outside
  Cambridge rather than\nwithin. The many departments of statistics in the country
  interpreted\ntheir brief far too narrowly - more narrowly than Galton or Fisher\nwould
  have found natural! It was Cambridge which saw the lack and tried\nto remedy it;
  a task requiring much hard work and inducing some\nhumility. Further, contrary to
  general belief, Cambridge has continued\nthroughout to recognise the special role
  of statistics and tried to\nrestore its own strength in this area. The attempt to
  cover much of\napplicable mathematics with a smaller staff than is devoted to\nstatistics
  alone in many universities has made this difficult. However,\nstrenuous efforts
  have been made to bring statistics to its proper\nrepresentation, and 1994 may see
  also these efforts crowned with\nsuccess. \n The visitors for the year 1967/8 included
  Ingram Olkin, Al\nMarshall, Mike Perlman and, again, Alfred R?nyi . Olkin and Marshall\nstarted
  a seminar series on inequalities, attended by R?nyi among\nothers. This was novel
  both in content and format: it provided the\nfirst local experience of a `bag seminar',
  to which one brought one's\nlunch. Ingram and Al presented their developing ideas
  on majorisation\nat this seminar, ideas which constituted the basis of their later
  text\non the subject. Al also took the chance to enlarge his collection of\nold
  flutes. \n Anthony Edwards was attached to the Lab 1968/70, and began a\ncourse
  in Mathematical Genetics which remains a standing option in the\nDiploma, although
  Anthony sees this course as a development of on begun\nby Fisher and George Owen
  in 1952/3. While his primary interest is\nmathematical genetics, Anthony is a scholar
  of both statistical\ninference and the history of statistics in Cambridge; most
  of the\nformal record in sections 2, 3 and 5 of this account is derived from\nhis
  1991 notes. His book Likelihood (1972,\nCambridge University Press) was written
  during his period of\nattachment. One may also see him as the high priest of those
  who tend\nthe memory of Fisher in the sacred groves of Caius (of which college\nFisher
  was a Fellow, as is Anthony). He read a paper to the Royal\nStatistical Society
  in 1969 on the estimation of evolutionary trees ( J.\nRoy. Statist. Soc. B (1970)
  32\n, 155--208). Solution of this difficult and fascinating problem was\nlater taken
  considerably further by his research student, Elizabeth\nThompson. Robin Sibson
  tackled the same problem in a different way in\nhis study with Nick Jardine of dendrogram
  techniques (Jardine, N. and\nSibson, R. (1970) Mathematical Taxonomy, Wiley).\nBoth
  Elizabeth and Robin were appointed at that time to University\nLectureships in the
  Lab; Robin from 1970 and Elizabeth from 1971. This\nactivity again demonstrates
  the falsity of the impression that\nstatistics lapsed in the Lab after the fifties:
  the estimation of\nevolutionary trees is an important, subtle and difficult statistical\nproblem;
  exactly the kind of problem that many mainstream statisticians\nwill regard as lying
  outside their brief. \n Books published by the staff must serve as an informative
  if\ninsufficient statistic of activity. Peter Whittle published Optimisation\nunder
  Constraints (1971, Wiley) as a text for one of the\noptimisation courses and Probability
  (1970,\nPenguin). Since this latter took the unconventional approach of\naxiomatising
  the expectation functional, it was unlikely to be adopted\nfor any course, but it
  was interestingly parallel to the work by de\nFinetti, appearing in English just
  at that time, which Dennis Lindley\nso espoused. \n John Gittins was also loosely
  attached to the Lab in 1969/70.\nIt was at this time that he was developing his
  solution of the\nmulti-armed bandit problem, motivated by the need for a rational\napproach
  to the allocation of exploratory research effort he had\nencountered while working
  with Unilever. The multi-armed bandit problem\nwas the problem of decision theory
  over the years\n1945-1980; it embodies the essential problem of balancing\nexperimentation
  against immediate dividend, but seemed so difficult\nthat people of some mathematical
  sophistication regarded it as\nintrinsically insoluble in any conventional sense.
  Few would have\nbelieved it if they had been told in 1969 that John had slain the\ndragon.
  It would be 1979/80 before his classic advance was recognised,\nsince when it has
  transformed a large part of the subject of stochastic\nscheduling. \n Violet Cane
  was instrumental in bringing in the rule that the\nHead of the new department, DPMMS,
  should be appointed for only five\nyears at a time, rather than until retirement.
  Thus it was that Sir\nWilliam Hodge yielded the Headship to Ian Cassels in 1969.
  \n The unlikely symbiosis of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical\nStatistics might
  not have succeeded but for Cassels' sympathetic and\nenlightened attitude. A distinguished
  number theorist himself, Cassels\ncould see, not only that a high proportion of
  the Faculty's graduates\nfound a career in statistics and related disciplines, but
  also that\nthese subjects were intrinsically interesting. Indeed, he was the first\nmathematician
  to give the Part II course in Mathematical Economics\n(previously given by a member
  of the Faculty of Economics), developing\nand publishing his own course text. It
  was Ian who repeatedly\nencouraged the Lab to think big. This venturesome attitude
  was in\ncontrast to his lesser concern for domestic matters. When money had to\nbe
  found it was always taken off the cleaning budget, which, despite\nits consequent
  exponential decline, always seemed to have some capacity\nfor sacrifice left in
  it. \n In 1969 David McLaren left for a post in Glasgow;\ncross-border balance was
  preserved by recruitment of Ted Harding from\nEdinburgh. His was regarded as a post
  in statistics. \n Robin Sibson was appointed in 1970 to a new University\nLectureship
  notionally assigned to Operational Research. He developed a\nlater interest in optimal
  experimental design, a subject experiencing a\nrenaissance at that time, and in
  which Cambridge, Imperial College and\nGlasgow for a while formed a triumvirate.
  All three groups enjoyed\nvisits from Valery Federov, who had just written his book
  on the\nsubject. The pleasantness of his company was not diminished by the\npossibility
  that he was perhaps more than a simple academic. \n Another statistical appointment
  was made in 1970. Pat Altham\nwas appointed as Assistant Director of Research (ADR)
  and also given\nspecific responsibility for the running of the Diploma by being\nnominated
  Director of Studies. She had continued in these duties ever\nsince (although later
  as UL) and has become less dispensable than\nanybody should be allowed to be. As
  a relic of her ADRship Pat fields\nthe statistical queries that come in both from
  other departments and\nfrom outside the University, and herself deals with most
  of them. As\nDirector of Studies she does much of the teaching for the Diploma\nitself
  plus all of the administration: e.g. the organisation of\nadmissions, courses, examinations
  and applied projects. The project\nretains its central role in the Diploma course,
  but to find applied\nareas of the right level and interest equipped with a willing
  applied\nsupervisor is by no means easy. In fact, the scheme is workable only\nbecause
  of the contacts and goodwill Pat has built up through her\nconsultation work. \n
  David Kendall's `fields of application' continued to be\narchaeology and astronomy,
  but there were outliers. A pig-breeder\ncalled to see him, and David listened, silently
  but sympathetically, to\na long discourse on swine fever. At the end of this his
  client rose and\nthanked him cordially for a most valuable discussion. Years later
  the\nsame man wrote, recalling the conversation and thanking David profusely\nfor
  opening his mind to totally new insights on the question of swine\nfever. \n The
  Laboratory suffered a sad loss in the summer of 1970 by\nthe death of Rollo Davidson
  in a climbing accident in the Alps. Rollo\nhad been a research student in the Lab,
  had held a Junior Research\nFellowship at Trinity and just been elected to a Teaching
  Fellowship at\nChurchill. He was regarded as being of quite exceptional promise.
  Rollo\nhad published on Delphic semi-groups, p-functions and stochastic\ngeometry,
  and was beginning to pose questions in statistics and\noptimisation. The talent
  that had been lost was commemorated by the\ncompilation of two memorial volumes
  (eds. Kendall and Harding, 1973 and\n1974). The income from these was used to found
  the Rollo Davidson\nTrust, from which prizes for distinguished research by younger
  workers\nhave been awarded annually since 1976. \n A course introduced about this
  time was based on a suggestion\nof Rollo's, which he would have developed himself
  had he lived. This\nwas the `Markov methods' course in Part IB. A need was felt
  for a\nprobability course of an applied character; to build it around the\nMarkov
  theme gave a natural lead into stochastic processes. As nobility\nis said to need
  the constant (if covert) infusion of common blood to\nmaintain its vigour, so probability
  courses need a constant reminder of\napplications if they are not to waft themselves
  to Gallic heights and\ndisappear. This seems to be a law of nature, and is the reason
  why\nprobability is too important to be left to the probabilists. \n In 1971 Violet
  Cane left for the Manchester chair. She was\nreplaced by Elizabeth Thompson, a formidable
  young lady who handled all\nthe statistics courses with laconic ease. Elizabeth
  naturally took over\nthe Mathematical Genetics course as well, and tackled the Communication\nTheory
  course (which a few loved and most would not touch) with relish\n-- perhaps because
  it gave her a chance to talk about DNA sequences.\nHer work on inference problems
  for evolutionary trees continued; in\n1975 she was to publish Human Evolutionary
  Trees\n(Cambridge University Press).\n7.\n1972-85 Comings and goings\n \nThe terms
  of the Chair of Mathematical Statistics made the Professor ex\nofficio Director
  of the Laboratory. However, these had been\nformulated in the days when the Laboratory
  had but one chair. Perhaps\nDavid Kendall was aware of the belief that eleven or
  twelve years is\nthe maximal natural term of office; in any case, in 1973 he managed
  to\nhave the tie loosed and Peter Whittle appointed as Director.\n\n The new stage
  was set in the pleasantest fashion by the\nappointment of Geoff Eagleson to a ULship
  and the appearance of Bruce\nBrown as a visitor in 1972. Geoff Eagleson played a
  profoundly positive\nrole in the Laboratory; in teaching, research, student contact
  and the\ngood thrift of the Laboratory generally. When one thinks back to the\nfounding
  fathers of the Laboratory, one regards them as examples of\nancient virtue which
  cannot be equalled. However, in dedication and\ncharacter Geoff equalled anybody.
  He is one of a whole sequence of\nAustralians who have contributed to the Laboratory's
  life and success.\nBruce Brown was conspicuously another, but one thinks particularly
  of\nthe magnificent succession of research students: Daryl Daley, John\nPollard,
  Richard Tweedie, Tim Brown, Iain MacPhee, Phil Pollett, Adrian\nBaddeley, Alan Branford,
  Steve Evans, Ben Hambly, Terence Chan, Steve\nHanly, Nigel Bean, Jo Kennedy and
  Owen Jones. These were all good, some\nof them the very best, and they have kept
  the Lab's graduate research\ngoing at times when UK recruitment was thin. After
  all these years one\nmay reveal a fact known to Charles Goldie: that John Pollard
  secretly\ndoubled up his studies for his Ph.D. and his actuarial examinations. \n
  In fact, recruitment was by no means thin in the early/mid\nseventies, which was
  one of those periods when the research-student\ngroup developed a particularly vivid
  and productive life of its own.\nOne recalls David Aldous, Frank Kelly, John Kent,
  Bill McGinley, David\nProbert, Brian Ripley, Jeremy Rudge and Bernie Silverman.
  \n Geoff Eagleson worked closely with Andrew Barbour, who had\nbeen associated with
  the Lab from 1969; successively as Diploma\nstudent, research student, Fellow of
  Caius and Director of Studies for\nthat college. Andrew made a succession of strong
  advances in\nprobability on the pure/applied borderline. His talents were recognised\nadequately
  first when he was appointed to a chair in Z?rich in 1984. \n Ian Cassels' continued
  exhortation and support bore fruit in\n1974 in the form of another Lectureship,
  to be notionally assigned to\nOperational Research. Doug Kennedy was appointed;
  immediately from\nSheffield but, before that, from Trinity College Dublin and Stanford.\nWith
  his Stanford background Doug was the only staff member with any\nformal OR training.
  \n Life was enriched when Wally Smith, Joel Cohen and John\nHajnal spent a sabbatical
  year at the Lab in 1974/5 and Henry Daniels\nin 1975/6. It was a particular pleasure
  to have Henry and Wally back -\na link with the St Andrew's Hill days. Henry divided
  his time between\nthe Lab and the King's College Research Centre, where he was charged\nwith
  the organisation of a seminar in mathematical biology. \n Various references have
  been made to the less than palatial\nhousing of the Department. In this connection,
  Kevin Donnelly (research\nstudent 1976/9, now answering to Caoimhin O Donnaile)
  tells how he\nfound Thomas Bruss (research student from Germany, now in Brussels)\ntaking
  a photograph of the main entry to the Department, a warehouse\nback-door flanked
  by milk-bottles and randomly-packed bicycles. He\nintended to send this to his parents,
  who could not otherwise be\nconvinced that such a prestigious department was to
  be approached\nthrough such portals. Kevin also tells a story which charity bids
  us\ndismiss as apocryphal. One student was heard asking another the purpose\nof
  the gigantic rubbish bins outside the actual back-door of the\nDepartment. His friend
  explained that these were for discarded notes\nand that ``they are sometimes picked
  through by Oxford research\nstudents desperate for material for their theses''.
  \n Alistair Mees was appointed to a ULship in 1975, again\nnotionally allocated
  to Operational Research. It was always difficult\nto find staff in OR; since there
  were virtually no mathematically\nadvanced courses in OR in the country very few
  had such a training.\nWith luck one could find someone with USA training (as in
  Doug\nKennedy's case) or else someone of approximating interests and\nsufficient
  enthusiasm to bridge the gap (as in Robin Sibson's case).\nThe latter was the case
  also for Alistair. He had worked in control\ntheory, largely in the analysis of
  nonlinear systems, and later won an\nAdams Prize for his essay Dynamics of Feedback
  Systems\nem> (Wiley, 1981). While maintaining his interest in nonlinear\ndynamics
  he also moved seriously and permanently into optimisation and\nassociated algorithmics.
  \n Jim Pitman was appointed to a ULship in 1976, bringing both\nthe highest standards
  in probability and an honoured name. Jim's\nnatural sphere is the USA and in 1978
  he returned to Berkeley. He was\nreplaced by the appointment of Frank Kelly to a
  ULship. This meant\nreiving a valued young member of staff from the Control and
  Management\nStudies Group of the Department of Engineering, but its Head, Alastair\nMacFarlane,
  bore no grudge. Relations of the Lab with the Department of\nEngineering have always
  been good, particularly with Control\nEngineering and with Management Studies (which
  for a time had a joint\nexistence but are now again separate). There are natural
  communities of\ninterest, of course, although this is in general no guarantee of\namicability,
  and there has been movement of members between the groups\nin both directions (e.g.
  John Gittins, Stephen Watson, Frank Kelly and\nRichard Weber). \n Frank's return
  was to have profound long-term consequences\nfor the Lab. It was a return, because
  Frank had been a Ph.D. student in\nthe Lab 1973/6. He had been supervised by Peter
  Whittle in the area of\nJackson networks, with its associated reversibility and
  balance\nconcepts. This class of ideas turned out to be butter to Frank's\nremarkable
  intuition. Frank achieved extensions of the Jackson theory\nnot only for the queueing
  context but also for other and apparently\nunrelated application areas. His book
  Reversibility and\nStochastic Networks (Wiley, 1979) demonstrated the striking\nunification
  thus achieved, and made Frank's name instantaneously. \n The tempo seemed to increase
  in those years. Peter Whittle\nwas elected FRS in 1978. His discovery in 1979 of
  an alternative proof\nof the optimality of the Gittins index policy for the multi-armed\nbandit
  problem had the effect of bringing about the long-overdue\nrecognition of John Gittins'
  solution of the problem. \n Retiring professors were also beginning to home back
  to the\nLab: Henry Daniels from Birmingham in 1978 and Violet Cane from\nManchester
  in 1981. That Violet should return was expected, since she\nhad kept her cottage
  in Little St Mary's Lane. However, that Henry\nshould wish to do so was both surprising
  and gratifying. Henry had a\nrespect for red-brick virtues and found these notably
  lacking in\nCambridge; the college slights of earlier years still rankled. However,\nperhaps
  he found some of the Lab's work in applied probability to his\ntaste. The reverse
  compliment certainly holds; he is held in high\nregard and affection, and is doughty
  enough in controversy to be\nallowed no quarter, despite his age. He was elected
  FRS in 1980,\nbringing the Lab count to three. Belated but generous justice was\nachieved
  by David Williams in 1992, when Henry was made an Honorary\nFellow of Clare. \n
  Manfred Gordon, a polymer chemist who had published classic\nwork on the statistics
  of polymers with Jack Good, had been a visitor\nin the Lab 1972/3. In 1978 he retired
  from Essex and also took up\nresidence in the Lab. Manfred had hoped that the interest
  in the\nprobabilistic aspects of polymerisation which he shared with Peter\nWhittle
  would form the basis for some real programme. Alas, the\nLaboratory was in its familiar
  quandary of having to split its limited\nhuman capital too many ways, and simply
  could not afford this venture.\nInterestingly, B?la Bollob?s and his stable of random
  graph theorists\nwere working along parallel lines, although in a style different
  enough\nthat collaboration was never natural. However, Manfred, even if\ndisappointed,
  continues to illuminate the Lab with his gentle erudition\nand wide culture. \n
  Martin Barlow was appointed to a ULship in 1982. He\nreinforced the extraordinarily
  high quality of the group, many of them\nresearch students, working on stochastic
  integrals, stochastic\ndifferential equations and flows and spatial processes on
  strange\nmanifolds. \n In 1983 there was a contentious move, in a literal sense.
  The\nDPMMS library, which had been housed on the first floor of the DPMMS\nbuilding,
  was moved into the library vacated by the Faculty of Classics\nat the top of the
  Mill Lane Lecture Block, just over the road. The old\nquarters had been cramped;
  the new quarters are not merely roomy, but\nalso beautiful. The former Classics
  Library is light, lofty and\nelegant; a sequence of two-tiered galleried bays in
  light oak is\nsuffused by a clear natural light from above. Undoubtedly some\nconvenience
  has been lost in the translation, probably more from the\nvertical component than
  the horizontal one. However, this is perhaps\none case when academics' known inability
  to refuse an offer has led to\nthe right outcome. \n Publications again: in 1981
  Elizabeth Thompson published Genealogical\nand Genetic Structure with Chris Cannings
  (Cambridge\nUniversity Press) and in 1982/3 Peter Whittle published the two-volume
  Optimisation\nover Time (Wiley). \n There were a number of losses in 1984. The Lab
  lost a friend\nin office when Ian Cassels retired. Martin Barlow resigned to\nconcentrate
  on research, and Alistair Mees resigned to take up a chair\nin Western Australia.
  \n With the loss of Alistair the difficulty of finding an OR\nreplacement had again
  to be faced. It was solved by the appointment of\nColin Sparrow, highly regarded
  for his work in nonlinear dynamics,\nnotably chaos theory. Colin's actions are based
  on pragmatism and\nprinciple; convention is not so much disregarded as irrelevant.
  To fill\na longish gap between graduation and the securing of a post in King's\nhe
  had driven a bus in Cambridge and had sold ice-cream on King's\nParade (wearing
  a top-hat, to the tourists' delight). The appointment\nstretched the range of interests
  represented in the Laboratory by more\nthan was wise or comfortable, but the Lab
  has benefited greatly from\nColin's idiosyncratic virtues.\n8.\n1985--92 Martingales
  and the Mabinogion\n\nDavid Kendall was due to retire in 1985. The usual measures
  were taken\nto advertise the post, in the sober and sincere intention that a\ngenuine
  statistician should be appointed if possible. However, that the\nLab is part of
  the Faculty of Mathematics places its own constraints.\nOne has to meet the standards
  of the Faculty (the students would be\nmerciless towards anyone who did not) and
  the Lab now had its own\ndeveloped standards as a group in applicable mathematics.\n
  It is perhaps not divulging too much to say that there were\ntwo very strong statistical
  figures in the running; one of these\nultimately withdrew and the other presented
  special problems. The\nElectors were then faced with a rerun of the 1962 scenario;
  David\nWilliams was so clearly the strongest residual candidate that he was\nelected.
  He then joined the Laboratory in 1985. Two others effectively\ncame with him from
  Swansea; Chris Rogers was appointed as a UL and, in\n1986, James Norris to a New
  Blood post as UAL. With these two\nappointments the strength of the Lab in pure
  probability was clearly\nmaintained, and its average age decreased. \n David Williams
  brought the highest degree of professional\nstrength, together with a particular
  warmth and generosity of\npersonality. Sensitive to the possible charge of mathematical\npreciousness
  (which he of all people could have disregarded) he\nlectured and supervised a whole
  range of courses in probability and\nstatistics. He gave two graduate lecture series
  (Connections and\nPercolation) which bridged probability, modern physics and pure\nmathematics
  with rare power and evoked sustained interest from the\nstaff of the whole Faculty.
  His breadth manifested itself in the truest\nfashion; students left David's courses
  knowing something of the\nMabinogion as well as of martingales. \n In retirement
  David Kendall developed his study of\nstanding-stone configurations into a `theory
  of shape', working with a\nvery bright visitor from mainland China: Huiling Le.
  In the following\nyears he was awarded the Royal Statistical Society's Guy Medal
  in Gold\nand the De Morgan Medal of the London Mathematical Society,\ncomplementing
  the Sylvester Medal already awarded by the Royal Society.\nHowever, David maintains
  that it is his founding of the Bernoulli\nSociety, jointly with Jerzy Neyman, which
  gives him the greatest\nsatisfaction. \n David Kendall continued to occupy a room
  in the Lab and use\ncomputing facilities. University departments vary widely in
  their\npractice towards retired members. University policy must of course be\nthat
  they have no rights, and departments under the severest resource\npressures must
  also see it this way. However, groups which consider\nthat they can both stretch
  resources and avoid the problems an\ninsensitive senior retir? might pose do in
  fact offer a continuing\nhome. Henry Daniels had been given a room on this basis,
  as David was\nnow. Violet Cane and Manfred Gordon had received partial facilities
  on\nthe same basis. One must not see this practice as resting on pure\ncharity or
  sentiment; the `Advanced Fellows' offer depth to the group\nin several ways, and
  their presence is often particularly appreciated\nby the youngest members of the
  group: the graduate students. One might\nalso say that any other attitude would
  scarcely be consistent with a\nhealthy feeling of group identity. \n It was in 1986
  that Elizabeth Thompson published her Pedigree\nAnalysis in Human Genetics (Johns
  Hopkins Press) and then\nresigned to take a chair of statistics at the University
  of Washington.\nIt was a pity to lose her from the Lab, but a greater pity to lose
  her\nfrom the country. She had applied for chairs of statistics in the UK,\nbut
  committees with a narrow concept of statistics appointed candidates\nclearly her
  inferior. \n As argued earlier, books published by the staff do not\nreflect everything,
  but they must reflect something. In 1986 Wiley\npublished Peter Whittle's Systems
  in Stochastic Equilibrium\nand in 1987 the revision by Chris Rogers and David Williams
  of Vol. 2\nof David's Diffusions, Markov Processes and Martingales.\nTo anticipate
  somewhat, in 1990 Wiley published Peter Whittle's Risk-sensitive\nOptimal Control
  and in 1991 Cambridge University Press\nbrought out two sets of lecture notes based
  on existing Part II\ncourses. These were Communication Theory (Charles\nGoldie and
  Richard Pinch) and Probability with Martingales\n(David Williams). \n A very significant
  and encouraging development was the\nemergence in 1985 of the Stochastic Networks
  Group. Frank Kelly's\ninterest in queueing networks had developed, through a contact
  with\nBritish Telecom which was later formalised, into an interest in\ncommunication
  networks. Communication and computer specialists\nworldwide were beginning to recognise
  that such systems generate\ninteresting and difficult stochastic problems, with
  optimisation (or at\nleast good performance) very much a consideration. Frank had
  attracted\nsome very good students to this field early in the decade (e.g. Iain\nMacPhee
  and Ilze Ziedins). However, by the mid-eighties a very bright\nand substantial group
  had been formed by the arrival of Richard\nGibbens, Graham Louth, Phil Hunt and
  Neil Laws; this was reinforced by\nthe development of a close working relationship
  with British Telecom.\nThe group now constituted itself the Stochastic Networks
  Group. It also\nprovided the first case in which the Lab had clearly achieved critical\nmass
  on any research topic. Over the years a modest staff had been\ntrying to cover a
  wide field, with the result that real concentration\nwas reached on no single topic.
  The critical local density was now\nachieved for the first time. Moreover, the group
  was answering an\nadvanced technological need at just the right time. The introduction
  of\nelectronic telephone exchanges means that, for example, new\ncall-routing methods
  are both possible and necessary. Frank Kelly and\nRichard Gibbens evolved the Dynamic
  Alternative Routing scheme, which\nprovides near-optimal performance by simple means
  and has since been\nput into practice by British Telecom. This is only an example
  of the\ntype of challenge large systems are offering. The Stochastic Networks\nGroup
  (and with it the Lab), although small enough in all conscience,\nnow has a high
  international reputation in the study of communications\nnetworks. It is likely
  that an Institute of Telecommunications will be\nfounded in the University of Cambridge
  in the near future, supported by\nindustry, with the Stochastic Networks Group as
  one of its prime\ncomponents. \n The impression created by the many references to
  the\nBrunsviga should now be corrected; computing facilities in the Lab have\nof
  course kept pace with the times. They are used as a teaching adjunct\nonly for the
  Diploma practical class and occasional other courses, such\nas the multivariate
  analysis class. However, everybody computes, of\ncourse, and reactionaries who do
  not have this basic skill are now so\nrare as to be acquiring antiquity value. \n
  The manual Brunsvigas continued in class use until at least\n1947/8, although being
  progressively replaced by electromechanical\nmachines from about 1944. By 1964 the
  mainframe Titan was then also\navailable, using autocode and paper tape. Hewlett-Packard
  pocket\ncalculators were adopted in 1973, followed by programmable calculators\nin
  the late seventies. Fortran was by now used for calculations on the\nIBM mainframe.
  In 1983 the change was made to BBC micros, using a Torch\ndisc drive, BASIC, and
  with Glim available on disc. Statistical\npackages also became available on the
  mainframe: SAD, BMDP, Genstat and\nSPSS. Computing power in the Lab was greatly
  enhanced in 1987 by\nHewlett-Packard's donation of several Unix work-stations. It
  was the\nmanifest success of the Stochastic Networks Group which prompted\nHewlett-Packard
  to make this generous and much-appreciated gift. These\nwork-stations were linked;
  about this time the ethernet local area\nnetwork was installed throughout the Lab.
  Now, in 1993, the network is\nbeing greatly enhanced, with the provision of X-windows
  and packages\nsuch as Splus, Glim and Mathematica. \n A refreshing interlude was
  provided in 1986/7 by David Banks,\nwho gave highly appreciated and capable relief
  teaching in statistics\nfor the year. David came from Berkeley and returned to Carnegie-Mellon,\nand
  it was he who made us realise what a positive benefit such a\n`casual' can be. In
  both classroom and commonroom David at once fitted\nin and brought a breath of fresh
  air; we feel that he left us rather\nthan that he visited us. \n There were various
  developments in 1987. One was David\nWilliams' resigned assumption of the Directorship.
  Another was the\nRoyal Statistical Society's celebration of its Charter Centenary
  by a\nthree-day meeting in Cambridge (more particularly, in the Cambridge\nUnion).
  The Lab provided local organisation, a task it carried out\nwillingly and enjoyed.
  Finally, there was a welcome accession of\nstrength on the statistical side with
  the appointment of Alastair Young\nto a UALship. He and Henry Daniels cooperated
  on a mathematical\nevaluation of the bootstrap method. \n Peter Whittle was awarded
  an SERC Senior Fellowship for the\nyears 1988/91 to enable him to work on another
  variety of networks:\nneural networks. The consequent necessity of finding a temporary\nteaching
  replacement again provided a bonus. Charles Goldie was\nappointed for a two-year
  period which was, reasonably enough, as much\nabsence as the University of Sussex
  would allow him. Charles proved\neager and capable in high degree. He took on the
  courses in convex\noptimisation and communication theory, which were quite new to
  him,\nwith enthusiasm and thoroughness. An byproduct in the second case was\nthe
  CUP course text, already mentioned, written with Richard Pinch. \n There was little
  expectation that one would find a third-year\nreplacement to match Charles, who
  had been the happiest solution in\nevery respect. However, Yurii Suhov, from Moscow,
  showed interest. He\nhad already visited the Lab and, with his background in statistical\ncommunication
  theory among other things, seemed a very good bet,\nalthough obviously in some respects
  an outside one. Visa trouble\ndelayed him in Dublin until late January 1991, which
  made him thrice\nwelcome when he came. He was appointed to a regular ULship later
  that\nyear. Yurii brings skill in the applications of probability to\nstatistical
  physics; also the well-known strengths of the mathematical\nculture in which he
  was brought up. \n In 1989 Frank Kelly was elected an FRS; a happy development\nin
  itself, and one which brought the Lab's tally to five (Henry Daniels\nand David
  Kendall being assuredly counted always as Lab members). This\nwas followed by his
  appointment to a personal chair. \n Chris Rogers left in 1991 for a chair at Queen
  Mary and\nWestfield College, London, joining Charles Goldie there. Chris had been\na
  great enthusiast for all stochastic analysis related to Brownian\nmotion. In recent
  years he had also developed an interest in\napplications: to some part in statistical
  consultancy but to some part\nalso in financial modelling. The quite sophisticated
  mathematical\nanalysis of option-pricing and the like has engaged the attention
  of\nmany probabilists over recent years: in Cambridge, of Chris Rogers,\nDoug Kennedy
  and David Williams. In 1993/4 it will find its way into a\nPart II course. \n Chris
  Rogers was replaced (although the correspondence\nbetween resignations and appointments
  is inexact) by the appointment of\nGareth Roberts as a UAL in 1992. Gareth's background
  was originally in\nprobability, but he had moved much more into statistics while
  at\nNottingham with Adrian Smith. \n In 1991 David Williams resigned from his chair,\ncharacteristically
  giving for notice as much time as would be needed to\nfind his replacement. He had
  made earlier resignation attempts,\nalleging his own inadequacy for the post, a
  charge so ludicrous that\nwords could scarcely be found to counter it. David Kendall
  and Peter\nWhittle had baulked these by writing independently to the\nVice-Chancellor
  and asserting (sincerely and without collusion) that\nDavid Williams was the best
  Director the Laboratory had ever had.\nHowever, he was now resolved. His real reasons
  were perhaps the obvious\nones: a weariness with administration, a desire to get
  more of his own\nwork done, and hiraeth -- longing for Wales. However, strangely,
  and as\nno one in Cambridge had realised, when David left Swansea in 1985 he\nhad
  announced to the Senate there that he intended to occupy the\nCambridge post for
  just seven years. \n The fixity of David's decision was recognised, and Frank\nKelly
  took over the Directorship in 1991. The intention that David\nshould thus be spared
  worry in his last year at Cambridge was not in\nfact fulfilled; the difficulties
  of house-moving had reached their\nnow-familiar intensity, and David suffered serious
  health problems. It\nwas with great regret that the Lab saw him depart in 1992;
  an era of\nparticular warmth and vitality had closed.\n 9.\n1992--:Regeneration\n\nDavid
  Williams had given the Electors good time in which to replace\nhim, and the same
  care was taken to prepare a good field as in 1985,\nwith the same genuine anxiety
  to do right by statistics. However, to\nthe outside observer the election also provided
  a re-run of history.\nSeveral outstandingly strong probabilists had applied; the
  statistical\nfield was sound, but less outstanding, even if one measured each of
  the\ntwo fields by the world standards of its own discipline. The\nstatisticians
  were certainly given a margin of preference; against this\none must perhaps reckon
  an anxiety that the existing strengths of the\nLaboratory should not be gratuitously
  jeopardised.\n\n The outcome was that Geoffrey Grimmett was elected; he left\nBristol
  and took up his post in October of 1992. Geoffrey had made a\nvery strong name in
  the study of percolation processes and of random\ngraphs, interests which abut those
  of several in the Lab and the\nUniversity. \n The long-felt unease within the Laboratory
  itself that the\nsubject of statistics was inadequately represented was now supplemented\nby
  a growing realisation that the regime in which the Lab's first chair\ncontinued
  to be filled by a probabilist might be self-perpetuating, and\nindeed that such
  a pattern might not even be unreasonable if the Lab's\nexisting strength in the
  central topic of probability was to be\npreserved. Moves were then set afoot to
  establish a third chair, to be\ncalled the Chair of Statistics or whichever variant
  would emphasise its\nprotected nature: that it should under no circumstances be
  filled by\nany other than a genuine statistician. \n The course of this last election
  reinforced the unease;\nindeed, the conscience of some of the Electors was appeased
  only by the\nundertaking from John Coates, now the Head of DPMMS, that the proposed\nChair
  of Statistics would be the top Faculty priority. This is no light\nundertaking,
  but John, whose understanding and support for the Lab have\nmatched those of Ian
  Cassels, gave it unequivocally. It was further\ndecided that the search for suitable
  candidates for the new chair would\nbe undertaken much more deliberately and systematically
  than is the\nCambridge habit: that a Search Committee would be formed to actively\nbeat
  the world of statistics, and that the members of this committee\nwould ultimately
  form the nucleus of the Board of Electors. At the time\nof writing the case for
  the establishment of the Chair has just been\naccepted by the General Board of the
  University, and it is hoped that\nthe post will be filled by October 1994. \n Despite
  the great widening of its interests, the Laboratory\nremains the Statistical Laboratory
  and the Diploma remains the Diploma\nin Mathematical Statistics. However inadequate
  these may now seem as\ndescriptions, the feeling has been that to change them would
  be like\ntrying to doctor one's foundation stone. It is believed on the other\nhand
  that they constitute no false claim. \n In particular, the term `Operational Research'
  has not crept\ninto either title. For reasons which would take too long to recount,
  OR\nactivity in the Lab has been even more divorced from the activity of\nthe `OR
  community' than has been the corresponding case in statistics.\nNevertheless, it
  is notable that the Lab has supplied the only winners\nin the UK (and among the
  few in Europe) of the Lanchester Prize of the\nOperational Research Society of America:
  Peter Whittle in 1987 and\nFrank Kelly in 1992. Perhaps the term `operational research'
  is no\nlonger a fair description of what one is trying to do; something like\n`the
  mathematics of systems' may be nearer. \n The success of the Laboratory depends
  on all its staff and\nthe depth they supply; to measure the state of the Laboratory
  by the\nstate of its professorial staff would be invidious and misleading.\nNevertheless,
  the fact that the Statistical Laboratory has now\nprogressed to a professorial staff
  of four does underline the great\nchange in its circumstances since the fifties,
  and the composition of\nthis staff signals rejuvenescence and promise. Frank Kelly
  and Geoffrey\nGrimmett are both young and of high international reputation. If,
  as\none may reasonably expect, they are matched by those soon to be elected\nto
  the Churchill Chair and to the new Chair of Statistics, then,\nwhatever the Lab
  does in the coming years, it will lead.\n10. References\nBartlett, M.S. (1982) Chance

  There had been considerable activity in statistics in\nCambridge well before 1947,
  distinguished initially by some striking\nindividual figures and then by a quickening
  recognition of the subject\nas a field in its own right. In coverage of the earliest
  phases we draw\nlargely (and briefly) on Edwards (1991).  Edwards regards statistics
  as beginning in Cambridge with\nAugustus de Morgan (matriculated 1923), followed
  in that century by\nR.L. Ellis (1836), J. Venn (1853), J.W.L. Glaisher (1867), all
  prime\nnames in any history of statistics or probability. F.J.M. Stratton\n(1901)
  lectured on the Combination of Observations; Edwards' mention\nthat Fisher attended
  his lectures in 1911 gives a link with living\nmemory.  In 1912 a University Lectureship
  in Statistics was\nestablished to which G. Udny Yule was appointed, working in the
  Faculty\nof Agriculture. Yule was already the author of a very influential\ntextbook
  ( An Introduction to the Theory of Statistics,\nGriffin, 1911), but is now remembered
  for his subsequent work in time\nseries analysis. He opened a new era in this subject
  by his proposal of\nthe autoregressive process. Yule retired in 1931, by then a
  Reader, but\nremained an active figure. Maurice Bartlett mentions of his\npostgraduate
  year (1932/3) that Yule ``was very much one of my mentors,\nas he no doubt was of
  Maurice Kendall, who was a Cambridge student before\nthe Wishart era''  While the
  Statistical Laboratory has been the product of many\ninfluences, it is in the School
  of Agriculture that one rightly sees\nits genesis. Statistics has been fostered
  there as a tool and as a\ndiscipline from the days of Professor T.B. Wood, Udny
  Yule was a\nseminal and international figure and it was the interaction of the\nSchool
  and the Faculty of Mathematics (through the mediation of John\nWishart, as we shall
  see) which produced both the Statistical\nLaboratory and the Diploma. The School
  has continued its own vital\ninterest in the subject with the A.R.C. Statistics
  Group. The history\nof these developments has been set out very thoroughly by Colin\nCampbell
  (1959).  Harold Jeffreys came squarely on to the Cambridge academic\nscene when
  he was appointed a College Lecturer (St. John's) in 1922,\nthis being converted
  to a University Lectureship in 1926. Jeffreys'\nprimary interest, which was geophysics,
  stimulated him to a strong\nderived interest in inference. His books Scientific
  Inference\n(Cambridge University Press, 1931; third edition 1975) and Theory\nof
  Probability (Clarendon Press, 1939; third edition 1961)\nestablished his reputation
  in that field, then and now. Jeffreys'\napproach to inference (and by `probability'
  he often means statistical\ninference; by `inverse probability' he always does)
  was explicitly\nBayesian, with maximum entropy criteria also clearly formulated,
  and so\nstill finds considerable resonance.  Yule was succeeded on retirement in
  1931 by John Wishart,\narriving from Rothamsted. Wishart's Readership was primarily
  assigned\nto the Faculty of Agriculture, but the terms of his post directed him\nto
  give courses for mathematicians as well as for postgraduate students\nin agriculture.
  Bartlett writes: ``as there was space allotted to\nWishart in the School of Agriculture,
  where practical classes in\nstatistics were given, my own inclination is always
  to think of a\n`Statistical Laboratory' being in existence from Wishart's arrival
  in\nCambridge''.  Some idea of the activity at this time may be gained from\nEdwards'
  observation that a student taking Part III of the Mathematical\nTripos in 1935/6
  ``could hear Sir Arthur Eddington's `Combination of\nObservations' in the Michaelmas
  Term, John Wishart's `Theory of\nStatistics' in the Lent Term and Harold Jeffreys'
  `Probability' in the\nEaster Term''. Indeed, in 1931/2 Maurice Bartlett took just
  these\ncourses, with the substitution of Fowler's `Statistical Mechanics' for\nJeffreys'
  course.  In these days of student appraisal of lecturers etc. it is\ninteresting
  to note how common it seemed to be then that even\ninteresting material or brilliant
  intellects were accompanied by\nindifferent delivery. Some of us can take heart!
  Henry Daniels says of\nWishart that ``although the lectures themselves were not
  very well\ngiven, the material was very interesting'' and of Eddington\n``intriguing,
  and a little bizarre in some respects''. David Finney\nwrites of Jeffreys that his
  ``personal charm and enthusiasm did not\nprevent a steady decline in attendance''.
  Norman Bailey recalls\nJeffreys' lectures as being ``interesting but difficult,
  not least\nbecause from time to time Jeffreys would become inarticulate, simply\nwaving
  his arms while his brain moved on. When he rearticulated some\nminutes later in
  a perfectly lucid way it was apparent that we\nhad just missed what he had thought
  but had been unable to say in those\nprecious minutes''.  One might also note the
  number of people, later to become\nprominent statisticians, who passed through Cambridge
  before\nthe foundation of the Statistical Laboratory: e.g. Yates, Bartlett,\nFinney,
  Maurice Kendall, Daniels, Cochran, Barnard, Cedric Smith and\nArmitage.  Wishart
  was all the time endeavouring to promote the subject\nof statistics, and in fact
  to develop a programme in mathematical\nstatistics. In this he was not positively
  helped by the presence in\nCambridge of the two luminaries of the subject: Jeffreys
  and Fisher\n(who had been appointed Professor of Genetics in 1943). These two were\nof
  course accorded the respect of the Faculty of Mathematics, which\nWishart (based
  in Agriculture) was not, and Wishart had the ambition of\ncreating a working unit
  in statistics, which they did not. A lofty word\nfrom either of them could have
  a withering effect.  However, the Faculty of Mathematics evidently felt the need\nfor
  some in-house strength in statistics, and in June 1938 advertised a\nUniversity
  Lecturership for which special consideration was to be given\n``to candidates with
  qualifications in the Theory of Statistics''.\nMaurice Bartlett was appointed. With
  a break for war-work he held the\npost until 1947. He lectured first largely in
  statistical theory, a\nsubject which was still evolving to the shape we would recognise
  today.\nBartlett combined ideas which were in general circulation with his own\nstatistical
  research (never recognised at its full pioneering worth).\nFrank Anscombe took notes
  of this course which Henry Daniels later\nread, to realise that ``Bartlett's approach
  to the subject was one that\nI sympathised with very much''. Violet Cane attended
  Maurice's\nstatistics course in 1939/40; she recalls finding it difficult at the\ntime,
  but realised later that she had (and still has!) a beautiful set\nof notes. Development
  of ideas was then the consideration, rather than\nrigour, so, when Dennis Lindley
  asked Bartlett to prove consistency of\nthe maximum likelihood estimate in class
  in 1946, this was a little\ncruel, as he himself admits. It was to be yet a while
  before a good\nproof was found by Wald (and, actually, by Lindley also).  Maurice
  Bartlett is of course specially noted for his early\nand fundamental contributions
  to the theory of stochastic processes,\nbut it is first after his return from war
  work that he seems to have\ngiven a course on the subject , whose reach had still
  not been defined\nby a text. Bartlett's own text was one of the very first. The
  course\nincluded stationary time series and diffusion processes as special\ntopics.
  Norman Bailey attended it in 1946/7. He had trouble with time\nseries component,
  ``but the evolutionary process component was nothing\nshort of inspiring and had
  considerable importance for a lot of my\nlater applied research\". Wishart was also
  absent on national service\nduring the war years, when\nhis lectures were given
  by Dr J.O Irwin. Also, for at least one of\nthose years, mathematics undergraduates
  were required to come up during\nthe summer vacation to study electronics. Norman
  Bailey recalls\nenjoying the electronics much more than the statistics. Jeffreys
  also\nlater gave a short course in statistics, reputedly to Wishart's\nannoyance.\n
  Maurice Bartlett has kept copies of a three-way\ncorrespondence in 1943 between
  himself, Wishart and F.P. White, then\nSecretary of the Faculty Board of Mathematics.
  The former two were both\naway on national service; Bartlett writes from the Projectile\nDevelopment
  Establishment in Aberporth and Wishart from the Civil\nEstablishments Branch, Admiralty,
  Whitehall. White had written to all\nteachers of Mathematics in the University,
  including those on national\nservice, asking for their views on the pattern to be
  envisaged for the\nFaculty and its activities after the war. The Faculty still had
  no\ncollective physical accommodation, and had reported immediately before\nthe
  war that its most urgent need was ``the foundation of an Institute\nof Mathematics
  in close proximity to the Mathematical Laboratory and\nthe Philosophical Library''.
  \ Wishart was of course concerned with the position of\nStatistics; he plainly wished
  to escape from Agriculture, whose\ninterest in Statistics he considered too narrow,
  and very much wished\nto be associated with the projected Institute. On the other
  hand, he\nconsidered that Statistics should occupy a central position relative to\na
  number of Faculties, and sketched a case for the establishment of a\nseparate Faculty
  of Statistics. He nevertheless obviously regarded the\nFaculty of Mathematics as
  the best single peg on which to cling\nimmediately: ``Returning to the question
  of the Institute, an `embryo'\nschool of Statistics should certainly be housed therein''.
  He wished\nsuch a school to be open to members of any Faculty, but that its\nfundamental
  basis should be mathematical.  Bartlett, already a member of the Faculty of Mathematics,
  was\nmore concerned with the provision of advanced courses. This meant Part\nIII
  courses; the Diploma was not yet envisaged. He was particularly\nconcerned to gain
  coverage for statistical (in fact, probabilistic)\nthinking in physical contexts,
  and for a new course on the `theory of\nstochastic processes', a topic then more
  familiar to some under the\nnames of `random functions' or `time series'.  The demand
  for trained statisticians revealed during the war\nwas such that in 1946 a second
  University Lectureship was advertised,\nto which Henry Daniels was appointed. Wishart
  could now see his\nlong-nursed ambition of a Diploma in Statistics approaching\nrealisation.
  There were discussions about the content of the proposed\nDiploma. Maurice Bartlett
  recalls a degree of irritation when, during\nhis convalescence after an appendectomy
  in 1946, he was ``visited by\nWishart in the nursing-home to discuss the final draft
  Diploma\nregulations. These included the requirement to take a `field of\napplication',
  which was facilitated by the link with agriculture and\nwith genetics, following
  the appointment of Fisher during the war to\nthe genetics chair''. Bartlett himself
  missed out on the actual\nfoundation; in 1947 he left to become the first Professor
  of\nMathematical Statistics at Manchester. He was replaced in Cambridge\nlate that
  year by Frank Anscombe, from Rothamsted, who took up the post\nin January, 1948.3.\n1947--55
  Creation and\nconfirmation In 1947 the Faculty of Mathematics submitted a report
  to the\nGeneral Board proposing the establishment of a Diploma in Statistics\nand
  a Statistical Laboratory, the former to be awarded to\nmathematicians who had attended
  a course and been examined in\ntheoretical and applied statistics, and the latter
  ``to provide\nprimarily for the applied work in Statistics for students of this
  and\npossibly of other Faculties, including Diploma and Research Students''.\n This
  was considered by the General Board in a Report dated\n14th May 1947 ( Reporter
  , 1946-47, p. 1058),\nwhich indeed recommended the institution of a Diploma in Mathematical\nStatistics.
  The qualification `Mathematical' had been inserted to quell\nthe concerns of some
  other Faculty Boards that the statement in the\nDiploma document that the candidate
  had displayed a special knowledge\nof Statistics and of its application in a certain
  field might be taken\nto imply that he was an expert in that field. Wishart's lifelong\nenthusiasm
  for the teaching of statistics was now\nbeing rewarded, and his dreams of a properly-established
  unit being\nfulfilled. At a Royal Statistical Society discussion meeting on the\nTeaching
  of Statistics which he opened he was able to report with pride\nthat ``it is now
  possible for a mathematical graduate at the University\nof Cambridge to take a one-year
  Diploma in Statistics, during which\ntime he will be attached to a department where
  practical work is done,\nand will be examined finally on his work in the chosen
  field of\napplication'' ( J. Roy. Statist. Soc. A\n(1948) 111 , p. 227). This relates
  to an\ninteresting theme which emerges repeatedly in the discussion: the need\nrevealed
  during the war for statisticians with both practical and\nmathematical competence.\n
  Fisher commented on these developments with his usual blend\nof soundness and tetchiness;
  Edwards quotes passages from his\ndaughter's biography of him (Box, 1978). Fisher's
  own words at the end\nare from a letter to Wishart in which he agrees to serve on
  a small\nadvisory Committee for the Diploma.  In 1950 the University did indeed
  amend the regulations for\nthe Diploma so that candidates without adequate mathematical\npreparation
  could be required to take two years over the course.\nDevelopments in the world
  of statistics over following years doubtless\nreinforced Fisher in his apprehensions.
  However, the Cambridge Diploma\nhas remained true to its initial conception: that
  the theoretical\ngrounding should be accompanied by close acquaintance with an applied\nfield
  and a testing investigation of data from that field.  The General Board report quoted
  above passed over the\nquestion of the foundation of the Statistical Laboratory
  as an\ninstitution, but nevertheless discussed the provision of accommodation\nfor
  the Laboratory. Whether this was deliberate is unclear. The\nBuildings Syndicate
  had already indicated its conditional preparedness\nto ``recommend the assignment
  of a vacant site in Corn Exchange Street\nfor a temporary hut'' ( Reporter , 1946--47,
  p.\n1296). So, the Statistical Laboratory existed to the considerable\nextent that
  it was to have its own building, erected to its own\nspecifications submitted through
  the Faculty Board of Mathematics. More\nthan that, eloquent and conclusive, the
  structure when completed\ncarried a sign: `Statistical Laboratory'. The building
  was indeed a\n`hut': brick, single-storey, 70 feet by 24, with six working rooms,
  one\nof these being a larger `students' room' which served also for\nseminars. It
  faced on to St Andrew's Hill, a lane off Corn Exchange\nStreet which has since been
  obliterated by the Lion Yard car park.  Dennis Lindley's recollection of the plan
  of the building and\nits eventual occupancy is sketched below. Dennis's impression
  is that\nDavid Cox used whatever room happened to be spare, although this\npresumably
  did not continue. He mentions also that Wishart's original\nplans made no allowances
  for lavatories. We see them here beside the\nboiler, of which more anon.   For the
  session 1947/8 accommodation had perforce to be found\nin the School of Agriculture,
  classes being held there and in the Arts\nSchool. Frank Anscombe recalls Henry Daniels
  demonstrating his Bicycle\nTheory (a counterintuitive steering theory) outside the
  School of\nAgriculture building, so remembered with affection. However, in 1948\nthe
  staff (namely: Wishart, Daniels and Anscombe, with two computing\nassistants: Donald
  East and Ena Laurie) moved to St Andrew's Hill.\nWishart seems to have shifted from
  his quarters of 16 years in the\nSchool of Agriculture without hesitation. Bartlett
  comments: ``Wishart\nwas always keen to `push' statistics, and I don't know whether
  this\ncontributed to his falling-out in due course with Engledow, then\nDirector
  of the School of Agriculture, and that in turn to the creation\nof the Laboratory''.
  However, that the School of Agriculture had indeed\nbeen helpful is indicated by
  an acknowledgement in the report from the\nFaculty Board of Mathematics: ``In the
  past, a number of graduates in\nMathematics were encouraged to spend a fourth year
  in research and in\nequipping themselves as practising statisticians; the Board
  have been\nindebted to the Department of Agriculture for equipping a small\nlaboratory
  which provided the necessary facilities''. Such an origin\ncertainly made it natural
  to carry over the title `statistical\nlaboratory' which, while accepted at University
  College London as given\nby Galton, sat rather less naturally in a Faculty of Mathematics.
  \ In any case, John Wishart's `pushing' was to good effect.\nDennis Lindley was
  appointed in 1948 to a Demonstratorship and David\nCox in 1950 to an Assistant Lectureship.
  David Cox was well known to\nHenry Daniels; the two had worked together at the Wool
  Industries\nResearch Association -- one of those pragmatic institutions whose mark\nits
  sometime members happily bear for life (see Daniels and Whittle,\n1993).  Ingram
  Olkin mentions, interestingly, that many of the\nsignificant departments of statistics
  in the USA were founded about\nthis time: Columbia and North Carolina in 1946, Stanford
  in 1948,\nBerkeley and Chicago around 1952 and Iowa State somewhat earlier.\nWishart
  set the content and tone of the teaching for the first term of\nthe Diploma; Violet
  Cane recalls feeling distinctly depressed and ready\nto quit. However, matters changed
  greatly for the better after\nChristmas, when Henry Daniels took over courses, and
  even more so after\nEaster (1948), when Frank Anscombe joined. Relief seems to have
  been\ngeneral; Norman Bailey writes that ``the General Mathematical\nStatistics
  course was given by Henry Daniels most brilliantly, as\nevinced by the resounding
  ovation he received at the end''. Norman\ntestifies to the meatiness of the course,
  as does John Nelder (Diploma\n1948/9). Design of Experiments was done thoroughly
  in those days. Frank\nAnscombe gave the course in John's year; he dragged the class
  through\nGalois fields in lectures and then asked candidates to design a\nrotation
  experiment in the practical exam.\n Henry Daniels has preserved his class lists
  from that time.\nFrom his Stats II course for 1947/8 we can identify the members
  of the\nfirst Diploma year and recognise many of them: N.T.J. Bailey, V.R.\nCane,
  J. Durbin, G.S. James, S.F. James, F.H.C. Marriott, P. Robinson,\nD.C. Shaw, N.J.
  Wang and L. Whitehouse. There are other familiar names\non the list; e.g. J.M. Hammersley,
  J.A. Nelder and E.S. Page from Part\nII of the Tripos, J.E. Drummond and J.C. Tanner
  from Part III and R.M.\nWilliams, a research student. C.R. Rao was also in Cambridge
  that year;\nas a research student with Fisher, but attending the Lab seminars.  Dennis
  Lindley recalls some of the early Diploma examinations\nas being so difficult (in
  an attempt to impress the mathematicians with\nthe respectability of the subject)
  that they stumped staff as well as\nstudents, laying a supervision minefield for
  years to come. However,\nJim Durbin emphasises that, for the 1947/8 Diploma, the
  real problem,\nat least for him, was ``the seven-hour practical exam\n. We had 10
  students in a small room grinding away for dear life on\nBrunsviga manually-driven
  calculators all day long. The noise was\nhorrific and I found it so hard to concentrate
  I thought I'd probably\nmade a hash of it and hence, since Wishart was always going
  on about\nthe practical exam being the most important part of the whole affair,\nhad
  failed the Diploma. Fortunately, forbearance triumphed and I got a\nDistinction''.
  \ Both Henry and Violet speak of the particular vividness and\nexhilaration of the
  immediate post-war years, as people streamed back\nfrom war-work to resume their
  studies. This cohort represented a store\nof banked-up talent; individuals who valued
  the prospects that peace\nopened and met them with minds at once mature and fresh.
  One such was\nRobin Williams, who had been working on electromagnetic separation\nprocesses
  for the Manhattan Project, and who, despite encouragement to\nstay, chose rather
  to start research in statistics in Cambridge from\n1947. He was disappointed to
  find that his prospective supervisor,\nBartlett, had moved, to be replaced by Wishart.
  An appeal to Daniels\nresulted in his being passed on to Frank Anscombe for what
  turned out\nto be a rewarding collaboration (on the optimisation of experimental\nlay-out
  in the presence of spatial autocorrelation between plots).\nRobin recalls Anscombe
  and Daniels with warmth.  Other research students from this time were Dennis Evans,\nAndrew
  Ehrenberg (both 1949/52), Wally Smith (1950/3) and Ewan Page\n(1951/4). Wally very
  nearly missed the return to graduate work in\nCambridge. He had just served three
  years in the Royal Navy and had now\narranged study, grant and marriage. However,
  with the advent of the\nKorean War, all releases were cancelled. Wally was appalled
  at the\nprospect of the collapse of his plans and urgently required a ``letter\nthat
  would convince the admirals that I would be serving the nation\nmuch better studying
  Statistics than drowning in the China Sea'' -\nWally could not swim. He found it
  difficult to convince anybody in\nCambridge of the urgency of his case, but at last
  wrung a missive from\nhis supervisor-to-be, Henry Daniels, which, reinforced by
  support from\nDr Stoneley of Pembroke, did the trick.  Wally recalls the Stats Lab
  as he knew it: housed in the St\nAndrew's Hill hut. A cosy place, tiny offices,
  and a library whose\nexcellence he attributes to Lindley. The room containing the
  gas\nfurnace was off limits, with apparent good reason, as ``every week or\ntwo
  a considerable explosion would erupt''. The furnace was in the care\nof ``Donald
  East, who seemed, on first encounter, to be a little\ndistant and saturnine, but,
  on further acquaintance, proved to be\namiable and helpful, and very competent at
  his work (except, perhaps,\nfor those occasional lapses in the furnace room: once
  the detonation he\nproduced while making `necessary adjustments' caused a bang of
  many\ndecibels, and I do believe the doors rattled, while he came out\nbackwards
  from the furnace room at high velocity)''.  Something has been said of lecturing
  styles; Wally's\npen-pictures are too good not to reproduce in full. Wally refers
  to Dennis Lindley and David Cox repeatedly with\nunreserved gratitude and respect.
  David made ``everything he discussed\nseem so very very easy and straightforward.
  One kicked oneself at being\nso stupid as to need any instruction at all on such
  a seemingly trivial\nmatter.'' Dennis's purple hectographed notes on the Kolmogorov\ntreatment
  of probability summarised ``the most important for me of all\nthe lectures I ever
  attended as a graduate student''.  Wally entered research with some travail. ``Henry
  sent me\nover the road to the Zoology lab to work with a research man called\nJ.W.S.
  Pringle who was obtaining an abundance of photographic records\nof the nerve response
  of giant South American cockroaches. He would pin\n(literally) the poor but unphotogenic
  creature to a large block of wax,\nplunge an electrode somewhere into its brain,
  and then tickle its leg\nwith a camel-hair brush...I had little knowledge of the
  chemistry of\nnerve transmission and so on. Thus the months in which I should have\nbeen
  mastering measure theory and semi-groups and Fourier analysis and\nall those other
  good worthwhile things, I was floundering around trying\nto teach myself the rudiments
  of subjects I found very unattractive.''  Before Wally managed to obtain relief
  from the cockroach Ewan\nPage introduced him to EDSAC, of which both were then early
  users.\nRelief came via Dennis Lindley, who was then in the middle of his\nclassic
  work on queues. Wally was fascinated by the Wiener-Hopf\narguments. When Henry took
  a sabbatical in Chicago in 1952 Wally was\nreassigned to David Cox, ``the two years
  of work on cockroaches went\nout the window'' and Fourier ideas, Wiener-Hopf theory
  and renewal\nprocesses came in. Ewan Page was supervised by Frank Anscombe, of whom\nhe
  speaks with the\nsame warmth as does Robin Williams. `Inspirational' he says, with
  the\ncapacity to `let his mind wander' as they discussed problems. When\nFrank took
  sabbatical leave in Princeton 1953/4 Ewan was taken over by\nDavid Cox, who warned
  him: ``I don't have many ideas; I hope you don't\nwant me to give you an idea!''.\n
  Wally and Ewan together wrote a pools forecasting guide one\nweekend, which they
  tried to publish, without success. However, Ewan\nscored one of the historic triumphs
  of the Lab the following year\n(1953) when, using random numbers from the Fisher
  and Yates statistical\ntables, he won a First Division treble chance. According
  to a\nfinancially-straitened Wally, ``enough in those days to buy a modest\nhouse
  and a modest new car (if one chose)''.  Ewan tells how he was in Dennis Lindley's
  room one day,\ndiscussing a change-point problem on the board, when Wishart brought
  in\nA.C. Aitken. Aitken was of course famed for his feats of memory, and,\nsome
  considerable time later at a seminar in Edinburgh, Ewan challenged\nhim to recall
  what had been on the board that day. Aitken obliged.  Courses were of course given
  for the Mathematical Tripos as\nwell as for the Diploma. Anscombe started and Lindley
  then developed\nthe first Part II course in probability. It had to be entitled `Random\nvariables',
  however -- Jeffreys objected to use of the term\n`Probability', which he reserved
  to describe his own brand of Bayesian\ninference.  In 1953 the reality of the Laboratory
  became formally\nrecognised. Regulations for the Statistical Laboratory, which covered\nalso
  the post of Director, were proposed by the Faculty Board of\nMathematics in October
  1952 ( Reporter, 1952-53,\np. 810) and approved by the University on 21st March,
  1953. In April\n1953 J. Wishart, still a Reader in Statistics with primary appointment\nin
  the Faculty of Agriculture, was appointed Director.  Colleagues from that period
  give Wishart credit for the\nsingle-mindedness which at last brought the Diploma
  and the Laboratory\nto being. They give him less credit for sensitivity and tact.
  He would\nintroduce a member of the Lab staff to a visitor as ``My assistant'' -\nsave
  in the case of David Cox. Youth still rested so clearly on David\nthat he was more
  appropriately introduced as ``My student''.  All unknowing, the Statistical Laboratory
  was now at a zenith\nit would not hold for long and would not reach again for many
  years -\nsome would say `never', in that the character of those times will not\nrecur.
  It was fully set up, with a staff consisting of a Reader\n(Wishart), three University
  Lecturers (Anscombe and Daniels with a\nrecently-promoted Lindley) and one Assistant
  Lecturer (Cox) plus\ncomputing staff. It set the pattern and the standard for departments
  of\nstatistics throughout the country. In particular, one can say that the\nDiploma
  was the model for all the postgraduate courses in statistics\nwhich have been set
  up since. The Diploma itself was thriving, and its\nproducts occupied many of the
  key statistical posts in the country,\nuniversity posts among them. The staff were
  leading in research in\ntheir respective fields: Daniels in stochastic processes,\nposition-finding,
  steepest descents and components of variance,\nAnscombe in the design of experiments
  and sequential analysis, Lindley\nin inference and decision theory, and Cox in the
  design of experiments,\nsequential estimation, renewal theory and point processes.
  Wally Smith\nwas just completing his Ph.D. in a late rush: he had developed insights\ninto
  the analytic theory of renewal processes and the like. He and\nDavid Cox went on
  to collaborate fruitfully.  All the staff were heavily engaged in consultation for
  other\nUniversity departments, regarded as one of the prime functions of the\nLab.
  Lindley recalls: ``In common with other members of the Lab I did\nsome applied work,
  almost essential in order to provide facilities for\nthe Diploma candidates. The
  one I enjoyed most was for Rothschild on\nthe movement of sperm, giving a process
  that was not Markov of any\norder''. The Lab also had close relations with the statisticians
  placed\nin other departments, e.g. Norman Bailey in Medicine, Violet Cane in\nPsychology,
  and Colin Campbell in Agriculture. Norman Bailey held a\npost as Statistician to
  the Cambridge Medical School 1948/52; he was\nsucceeded first by Wally Smith and
  then by Bob Carpenter. He speaks\nfeelingly of the extent to which these lone statisticians
  relied on the\nStatistical Laboratory for back-up and advice when in need. He also\nwonders
  whether this increasing dispersion of applied statistics over\nother departments
  may not, in the course of time, have had some\nconsequences for the central focus.
  \ The Faculty recognised the function of the Statistical\nLaboratory, in that so
  many mathematics graduates found employment in\nstatistics, and doubtless recognised
  the Lab's worth, in that it\nconsidered its statisticians better than other peoples'
  statisticians.\nRecognition of the quality of the subject as such was slow to come,\nhowever,
  and it was a source of chagrin, particularly to senior members\nof the Laboratory,
  that their status and function were not acknowledged\nby the offer of a college
  fellowship. Indeed, no statistician was a\ncollege fellow at that time; not even
  Wishart, who had been a Reader\nfor 22 years.  On the other hand, the `problem of
  the non-fellows' was by no\nmeans particular to the statisticians. The Bridges Report
  (Reporter\n13/3/1962, p.1075) found that in 1961 only some 500-odd out of 950\nUniversity
  Teaching Officers and equivalent held fellowships.  William Jackson Hall spent the
  year 1953/4 in the Lab as a\nFulbright Scholar, working on his dissertation for
  the University of\nNorth Carolina. He remembers particularly Dennis Lindley's good\nresearch
  advice, the clouds of pipe-smoke which Henry Daniels generated\nin seminars and,
  of course, Ewan Page's pools win.  Robert Curnow took the Diploma in 1954/5, the
  same year as\nMaurice Priestley and Mervyn Stone. The Brunsviga lives in his memory,\ntoo,
  as does the occasion when David Cox became vexed by the time the\nclass took to
  invert a 7 ? 7 matrix on it. He also recalls Wishart's\ncourse on distributions,
  which stopped at the exciting part: evaluation\nof the fourth moment of the fifth
  cumulant. Ewan Page likewise shudders\nat the memory of the `acres' of pattern coefficient
  calculations\nrequired for these evaluations.  An innovation accompanying the change
  in status in 1953 was\nthe annual photograph of current Laboratory members: staff,
  computing\nand secretarial staff, research and Diploma students. The rows of these\nphotographs
  on the Laboratory walls fascinate all who call. They\nprovide quite the quickest
  way of determining who was in the Lab when,\nbut also constitute an invaluable and
  evocative historical record. They\nmanifest something which has been evident from
  those days: a sense of\nLaboratory identity and character, an esprit de corps which
  has\npersisted through weal and woe.4.\n1955--61 Disaster and diaspora In 1955 the
  Laboratory suffered a serious setback when David\nCox's appointment was not renewed.
  A University Assistant Lectureship\nwas a purely probationary appointment; for three
  years in the first\ninstance, extendable at most to five. It was in fact merely
  a stage in\nan open competition for one of the restricted number of lectureships;
  a\ncompetition in which the statisticians felt that they carried a\nhandicap, especially
  relative to the pure mathematicians. In this case\nthe post indeed went to a pure
  mathematician.  Nevertheless, David Cox was then regarded by the statistical\nworld
  as being of exceptional quality; a view which he has since\nconfirmed by becoming
  the leading figure in British statistics in his\ngeneration, powerfully bridging
  probability models, theoretical and\napplied statistics, and repeatedly honoured
  overseas. That the Faculty\nshould not recognise this seemed unjust and inexplicable;
  an affront to\nboth him and the subject. David himself has put the matter behind
  him;\nit is others who still feel outrage. Norman Bailey writes: ``Feelings\nwere
  very strong, both amongst members of the Statistical Laboratory\nitself and peripheral
  statisticians in other University departments,\nthat the growing and indeed talented
  mathematical statistical nucleus\nwas not being properly recognised, and that this
  was compounded by no\noffer of college fellowships. I believe that this led to an
  inevitable\ndiaspora in the years up to around 1957.''  The loss of the youngest
  staff member was then followed, in a\nmost curious way, by the loss of the oldest.
  In 1956 John Wishart was\nin Mexico, on leave. In July news came through that he
  had drowned\nwhile bathing in the sea off Acapulco.  Such events are not only tragic
  in themselves; they are\nsudden and shattering. Henry Daniels, deputising for Wishart
  during the\nlatter's leave, had now to wind up Wishart's affairs and take charge
  of\nthe Lab as Acting Director. Frank Anscombe left shortly after for a\npost at
  Princeton, moving later to Yale. In the following year, 1957,\nHenry Daniels himself
  left to take up the Chair of Mathematical\nStatistics at Birmingham.  Of the five
  1955 members of the academic staff of the Lab\nonly one then remained in October,
  1957: Dennis Lindley. On him fell\nthe task of reviving the fortunes of the Lab;
  he was appointed\nDirector. The staff situation had been somewhat shored up, in
  that\nWally Smith had been appointed to a ULship in 1956, replacing Frank\nAnscombe.
  However, he could return to the UK first at the beginning of\n1957. Wally had been
  rather unsettled (a `yo-yo', says Ewan Page) since\ncompleting his Ph.D. He had
  held the post in the Medical School at\nFenner's 1953/4. Earlier meetings with American
  visitors to Cambridge\n(Sam Wilks, Harold Hotelling, Leo Goodman, Jimmy Savage)
  had opened his\neyes. Far from showing the brashness believed to be the American\ncharacteristic,
  they exemplified ``the acme of gentlemanly courtesy''\nand a ``quiet respectfulness''
  not to be found in the RSS Research\nSection meetings, for example. So, when offered
  an attractive post at\nChapel Hill in 1954, he had taken it, although only after
  three months'\nindecision and then with many a backward glance to the UK. Ewan Page\nrecalls
  his plaint: ``Don't forget me so quickly!''. In 1956 he took\nthe chance to return
  to a full Lectureship in Cambridge.  After Henry's departure in the summer of 1957
  only Dennis and\nWally were left to carry the full burden of the Lab's teaching
  and\nactivity. Every moment of day and evening was committed; a desperate\ntime,
  although Wally also recalls it as exhilarating. However, Wally\nwas dispirited by
  what Neyman had characterised as the `second-class\ncitizen' status of the statisticians
  in Cambridge, and found the social\nlife cold or absent compared with the friendliness
  and informality of\nChapel Hill. What must have been a difficult decision and a
  time of\ndeep disillusion is only hinted at in Dennis Lindley's brief\nrecollection:
  ``Wally and Mary paid a visit to our house on the day the\nRussians launched the
  first Sputnik. Neyman and Elizabeth Scott were\nalso there. They had to cycle out
  to our house in the rain. They\ndecided a car in sunny Chapel Hill was better and
  left soon after.''\nThey left in summer, 1958, in fact, although often to return
  in body,\nand perhaps more often in spirit. Wally never found it easy; his lament\nfor
  the days that had passed should be quoted in full. Dennis had a desperate task to
  keep the Lab going, although\nhe took it evenly enough. There were two immediate
  recruitments; Morris\nWalker took up a University Lectureship in early 1958 (replacing
  Henry\nDaniels) and Peter Whittle in late 1959 (replacing Wally Smith).\nWhittle
  had no previous Cambridge connection at all, and Lindley had to\npress the Faculty
  hard to secure the appointment, even resorting to the\nthen unheard-of extravagance
  of telephoning New Zealand. In his turn,\nit took Whittle time to become aware of
  the cross-currents created by\nevents, realised and incipient. Some closer personal
  impressions of\nthese and later years at the Laboratory are given in Whittle (1994).
  \ The Laboratory left St Andrew's Hill in 1958. Thanks to some\nuncharacteristic
  maladroitness of the chemists it was given quarters in\nthe basement of the new
  Chemistry Building in Lensfield Road. Parquet\nfloors and lofty ceilings provided
  a degree of state unimaginable, at\nany time, to the Faculty of Mathematics.  As
  mentioned, L.J. Savage had already visited Cambridge, in\n1952. Dennis Lindley developed
  a closer contact with him while on\nsabbatical in Chicago in 1954, and became impressed
  by his ideas in a\nfashion which was to prove lasting. Savage again visited Cambridge
  for\nthe summer of 1958 and briefly in 1959.  Despite the reduction in its fortunes,
  the Lab still had a\nwonderful feeling of camaraderie - perhaps because staff and
  graduate\nstudents were so close in age. The names of the research students from\nthat
  time are now familiar: Ann Mitchell, John Bather, John Kingman,\nBob Loynes, Roger
  Miles, and Hilton Miller. Mervyn Stone had just\ncompleted. Staff and students seemed
  always to be adjourning to the\nSpread Eagle together to celebrate the augmentation
  of someone's\nfamily.  Donald East was the principal member of the computing staff,\nsurviving
  from the days in Agriculture, when he had acted virtually as\nWishart's secretary.
  He used an electromechanical Marchant, Dennis\nLindley a Facit. The Diploma students
  at that time were still using the\nmanual Brunsvigas of which Jim Durbin spoke;
  now museum pieces which\nhave unfortunately been disposed of. (However, Violet Cane
  possesses\none, and Jeffreys' machines are displayed in DAMTP.)  Dennis Lindley
  left to take up a new chair at Aberystwyth in\n1960. Donald East went too, changing
  his hobby from gardening to golf.\nThis was the first chair in statistics which
  had been created in the UK\nfor several years and there was little reason to expect
  that it would\nbe followed at all soon by others. Dennis also found the Aberystwyth\nprospect
  attractive. In fact, the expansion of the sixties was about to\nballoon, and there
  was a quickening even in Cambridge. The possible\nestablishment of a chair of statistics,
  mooted already in 1953, was now\nbeing discussed more definitely in the Faculty,
  and colleges were\nbeginning to make cautious overtures to Laboratory staff.  The
  disintegration of the `Wishart' Laboratory should perhaps\nnot be seen as a disaster,
  but as the natural fruiting of success. The\nLaboratory had reached a stage of maturity;
  that its members should be\ndispersed over other universities was very likely for
  the general good.\nThe event itself that triggered that dispersal was, of course,
  tragic.  Lindley, the last of the old guard, had a considerable\ninfluence - broadening,
  innovatory and lasting - on the activity of the\nLaboratory. The contribution he
  then made to queueing theory is a\nclassic of applied probability, which to this
  day generates new work.\nHis Bayesian enthusiasms are associated with his championing
  of the\nideas of L.J. Savage and B. de Finetti, but they also led him to\ndecision
  theory and some of the classic decision problems. This latter\ninterest may be seen
  as the germ of some of the courses in `applicable\nmathematics' which were later
  to develop. A point of interest: Dennis's\nundergraduate supervisor had been Besicovitch,
  himself a student of\nMarkov, so Dennis could claim Markov as his academic grandsire.
  \ Violet Cane was appointed UL in 1960 to replace Dennis.\nHowever, Peter Whittle
  left the next year to succeed Maurice Bartlett\nin the Chair of Mathematical Statistics
  at Manchester. The Lab\nphotograph for 1961/2 is graphic: the total group is now
  reduced to a\nhandful. Morris Walker, taking his turn as Acting Director, peers\nanxiously
  into the future.  Indeed, the future of the Statistical Laboratory had been\nunder
  consideration for some time; deliberations whose murmur seemed,\nhowever, not to
  reach the Lab itself. 5.\n1961--66 The Chair of Mathematical Statistics; Resurgence
  The buffets which the Laboratory had suffered since 1956 had\nbrought the Faculty
  to the realisation that its teaching of statistics\ncould be stabilised only by
  the creation of a senior post in the\nFaculty: a Chair of Statistics. Outside Cambridge,
  the absence of such\na chair was regarded as frankly anomalous.  The future form
  envisaged for the Laboratory was bound up\nwith the structure of the Faculty itself,
  which was at that time\npreparing to divide into the two existing departments. A
  1958 Report of\nthe Faculty Board to the General Board ( Reporter,\n1958--9, p.
  1375) proposed the establishment of a Department of\nTheoretical Statistics and
  Applied Mathematics, and added ``As regards\nthe Statistical Laboratory, its ultimate
  status is bound up with the\npossible establishment of a Chair of Mathematical Statistics.
  It may\nwell be appropriate to convert the Statistical Laboratory into a\nDepartment
  once such a Chair exists, but it would be premature to do so\nnow''.  The formal
  record is unrevealing on the question of whether\nthe true initiative for the establishment
  of a chair came from the\nUniversity itself, but one contributor to this account
  is in no doubt.\n``In spite of pressure from Wishart, Lindley, the RSS and probably\nothers,
  Cambridge University declined to create a Chair of Statistics.\nThe RSS Council,
  probably at Lindley's instigation, decided in disgust\nto try and raise enough money
  to endow a chair. They gave the job to\nthe next President, Maurice Kendall. At
  first he was a bit put out at\nbeing asked to raise a huge amount of money for another\nuniversity
  at a time when he was hard at work drumming up support for\nstatistics at LSE, but
  then he threw himself into the task with\ncharacteristic generosity and energy and
  was brilliantly successful.''  The formal records are blander. The Faculty Board's
  passing\nmention of a Chair quoted above became a firm proposal from the Faculty\nof
  Mathematics; this is referred to in a report from the Council of the\nSenate to
  the University in June 1960 ( Reporter,\n1959-60, p. 1684) The establishment of
  a chair was considered desirable\n``both because of the long association of the
  University with advances\nin Mathematical Statistics and the high calibre of Cambridge\nmathematical
  students, and because...a number of other Faculties who\ncall upon the services
  of the Statistical Laboratory would warmly\nwelcome it''. ``The [General] Board
  have said that they now have reason\nto believe that, by appealing to certain persons
  and bodies interested\nin the theory and application of the study of statistics,
  it may be\npossible to secure all or a large part of the funds necessary to\nmaintain
  the Chair.''  The `reason' mentioned by the General Board was the\npreparedness
  of the Council of Royal Statistical Society to launch an\nappeal to raise money
  for the chair. According to the RSS itself, it\nhad been approached by the Faculty
  of Mathematics with a request that\nit ``sponsor an appeal...'' (see J. Roy. Statist.
  Soc. A\n(1961) 124, p. 562). The Society saw this\nas a good cause and put its full
  weight behind the venture. Its\nPresident, Dr Maurice Kendall, was indeed outstandingly
  active in\npressing the appeal, which by 1961 had been brought to a successful\nconclusion.
  The contributing companies and banks are listed in J.\nRoy. Statist. Soc. A (1962)
  125\n, p. 616.  The University had agreed to the Council of the Senate's\nproposal.
  In October 1961 the Council announced the successful\ncompletion of the appeal (
  Reporter , 1961--2, p.\n326); it recommended the establishment of the Professorship
  and that\nthe Professor should be ex officio Director of\nthe Statistical Laboratory,
  whose ``establishment on a firm basis'' the\nFaculty Board of Mathematics regarded
  ``as a matter of great\nimportance''. The University accepted these recommendations
  without\ncomment.  The title of the Professorship corresponded to that of the\nDiploma.
  The duties of the Professor were not prescribed by any\nordinance, but the origins
  of the Laboratory, the involvement of the\nRoyal Statistical Society and the appeal
  to `persons and bodies\ninterested in the theory and application of the study of
  statistics'\nmade clear the intention.  The Electors to the new Chair met in May
  1962 and elected\nDavid Kendall to the post; he took up duties in October of that
  year.  That David Kendall should have been elected was not an\nentirely unexpected
  outcome, his personal claims on grounds of quality\nbeing overwhelming. It was a
  maverick outcome, however, in that David\nwas much more obviously a probabilist
  -- and at that time of fairly\npure leanings -- than a statistician. The matter
  has been debated then\nand since, not least because it may be argued that the appointment
  set\na precedent for the two subsequent elections to the same post. One\npoint that
  must be made is that the Board of Electors was a balanced\none (with the RSS represented
  by its President, Maurice Kendall), well\naware of the nature of the case that had
  been made both for the post\nand for the appeal which supported it, and the Board
  certainly\nconsidered all factors in reaching its decision. An interesting light\nis
  thrown by Dennis Lindley. He writes that, at the time when he was\nconsidering whether
  or not to apply for the Aberystwyth post, ``Maurice\nKendall was well-advanced in
  his appeal for money for a chair at\nCambridge, and had politely made clear to me
  that David Kendall would\nget it''. The coincidence of surnames is fortuitous --
  Maurice and\nDavid are unrelated -- so Maurice's intention, typically robust, was\ndisinterest
  itself. The quotation makes clear that Maurice was not\nambushed by other Electors,
  although another account represents this\nrather as a reluctant acceptance of the
  fact that David Kendall was\nintrinsically the strongest candidate.  More to the
  point, one can maintain that David Kendall\nsubsequently met the criticisms, in
  that he became a statistician in\nhis own individual way, and an ingenious and enthusiastic
  one. In\naddition to his continuing work in pure probability (Markov processes,\nstochastic
  analysis and geometry and random sets) and applied\nprobability models (bird navigation,
  structure of the retina, epidemic\nwaves and rumours) he became deeply interested
  in the inference and\nreconstruction problems of archaeology, such as grave sequencing,
  the\nreconstruction of local maps from information on contiguity etc., and\nthe
  recognition of regularities such as quanta of measurement and the\nplacement patterns
  of standing stones. These applications all had a\nparticular sense of intangibility,
  and were in fact pioneering and\nadvanced examples of the analysis of latent variable
  models.  David Kendall also `strove for statistics' (in David\nMcLaren's phrase)
  at the operational level. he made efforts to\nestablish contacts with statisticians
  in applied posts, such as Colin\nCampbell and Bob Carpenter; he secured David McLaren
  (who had joined\nthe group from Manchester as a research student), appointment as
  a\nsenior Assistant in research (later an Assistant Director of Research),\nwith
  partial responsibility for statistical consulting, he set up a\ncourse on inference
  in Part IB and pioneered the use of TITAN in the\nLab.  David's appointment brought
  one immediate political benefit\nto the Laboratory; the mathematicians recognised
  David as one of their\nown, with the consequence that the standing in the Faculty
  which the\nLaboratory had earned but not received was now granted overnight. John\nKingman,
  now a Fellow of Pembroke and a member of the Lab, was also\ngreatly influenced in
  bringing about change in attitude. Harold\nDavenport's reported reaction to the
  appointment was: ``Eeh, I did\nworry about who we might get, but eeh, we got a Professor
  of Statistics\nwho knows about lattice points!''. The colleges opened their doors
  and,\nindeed, from that time there has generally been competition to secure\nthe
  services of Laboratory staff as teaching fellows.  This rapport brought other consequences,
  however. Given the\nwill, the Laboratory could indeed have become a separate department.\nHowever,
  it would then have been expected to unify of statistics in the\nUniversity, so reversing
  the dispersion Norman Bailey mentions. In\nparticular, it would have been expected
  to absorb the statisticians\nrather loosely attached to other Faculties such as
  Agriculture and\nMedicine and probably to provide service teaching -- teaching for\nFaculties
  other than Mathematics. Such a course would have meant an\nincrease in role but
  a change in character; there are obvious arguments\nboth for and against it. In
  the event, the Laboratory joined the pure\nmathematicians to constitute the existing
  Department of Pure\nMathematics and Mathematical Statistics (DPMMS).  The Lab was
  still housed in the basement of the Chemistry\nBuilding when David arrived in 1962.
  It was honoured in the first term\nby a courtesy call from Fisher. He was carrying
  a stout stick; John\nKingman later affected to believe that this was for the administration\nof
  a cudgelling in case of displeasure. In fact, the occasion seems to\nhave been totally
  amicable, ending in lunch.  John may be playing down his own doughtiness; david
  McLaren\nrecalls the seminar which Fisher had given in Cambridge the previous\nsummer.
  in David's words ``A very recent graduate of the Diploma, I\narrived rather too
  promptly, when Fisher was already on his feet.\nHowever, he insisted on shaking
  my hand most warmly; presumably his\nshort sight prevented him from being sure that
  I was not the\nVice-Chancellor\".  Fisher's topic was `Sampling the reference set'.
  John Kingman\nbravely took issue with some of this, advancing to the blackboard
  to\ndemonstrate some counter-argument. Fisher started swinging his stick in\na most
  menacing way, not amicable at all. Eventually he dismissed John\nby demanding \"What
  does it matter if the mouse is a Unitarian?\".\"  In 1964 the whole Faculty was
  concentrated at the former\nPrinting House in Mill Lane, rendered vacant by the
  University Press's\nmove to new premises. The Statistical Laboratory moved with
  the rest of\nDPMMS into the warehouse building. One may now begin to use the present\ntense.
  The Mill Lane building is not an elegant one, but it is\nconveniently sited and
  has served the Department well. Strongly and\nsquatly built around a steel frame
  with a full-plan basement, it rather\nincongruously suggests a war-time bunker.
  The ground is weak near the\nsurface of the river bank; the bridging of the Cam
  at this point has\nhistorically presented a civil engineering challenge. As a consequence,\nthe
  Pure wing (the `old warehouse') of the L-shaped building tends to\nslip away from
  the Statistical wing (the `new warehouse'), giving rise\nto the `Daniels fault'
  at the junction -- a vertical crack which indeed\nstaggers the window of Henry Daniels'
  present room.  John Kingman accompanied David from Oxford in 1962, as a UAL.\nHe
  was upgraded to UL from April, 1964, at the end of which year he\nleft for a term's
  sabbatical and a post in Brighton. It was immediately\nbefore his departure and
  before the move to Mill Lane that John\nrendered his last great service to the Lab.
  John was a very junior\nmember of the committee concerned with allocation of space
  in the Mill\nLane building; he saw reconnoitre as his first necessity. ``The credit\nfor
  getting into the warehouse lies with Violet, who had a friend\n(whose name I had
  better suppress) in the Press. Thus Violet and I got\ninto the warehouse, by then
  cleared of paper but having no internal\nwalls except that between the old and the
  new warehouses. With its iron\nstanchions holding up the heavy floors it was like
  being on a C19th\nsailing ship.'' However, it turned out that the appointed Master
  of the\nvessel (Sir William Hodge) had already provisionally consigned the\nStatistical
  Laboratory to the bilges (the basement -- commodious but\ndismal). Thither it would
  indeed have been cast had not the brave cabin\nboy (John Kingman) spoken up, sturdily
  enough that he secured for the\nLab all of the upper two decks (the upper two floors
  of the new\nwarehouse) aft of the sole bulkhead (the aforesaid wall). John now had\na
  free hand in the partitioning of this space. Perhaps in reaction to\nthe depths
  into which he had peered, he was particularly insistent that\nthere should be a
  large common-room with many soft chairs and no\nblackboards.  When David Kendall
  arrived in 1962 the staff consisted just\nof Violet Cane and Morris Walker, with
  now the addition of John\nKingman. On this slight but genetically-rich base the
  Laboratory began\nto develop life again, in somewhat mutated form. Alfred R?nyi
  (soon to\ndie tragically early) was a visitor in 1963/4 and Jessie McWilliams,\nJoe
  Kruskal and Ronald Pyke in 1964/5. Through his connections with the\nAtlas Laboratory
  at Harwell David managed to arrange an Atlas\nFellowship at Churchill. John Hartigan
  held this in 1963/4 and helped\nout with lecturing (while Morris Walker was on sabbatical
  leave in\nAustralia). Roy Hodson held it for a time after that -- David was by\nthis
  time well into his archaeological phase. David was elected FRS in\n1964. In that
  year John Kingman left for Brighton and was replaced by\nBob Loynes, from Manchester.
  Bob Bechofer, who visited in 1966/7, was\nprevailed upon to lecture. When leaving
  he confided to David, in\namiable honesty: ``Your statistics is terrible!''.  It
  is not practicable to follow the passage of individual\nresearch students in the
  same detail as that of staff. What is natural\nis to recall the members of the research-student
  group at the times -\nquite definite - when this was especially flourishing. Some
  notable\nsingletons are then likely to be missed; they should be sure that they\nare
  remembered.  The research students played a particular role during these\nrecovery
  years in giving the group substance; David McLaren, Nick\nBingham, Daryl Daley,
  Charles Goldie, John Haigh, Peter Lee, David\nMannion, and Jane Speakman speak to
  us from the photographs.  David Williams performed his first transit of the Lab
  in\n1966/7, when he held a Research Fellowship at Clare. He recurs. Nick\nBingham
  recalls him from that time as ``a force of nature -\nunforgettable for linguistic
  as well as mathematical reasons''.6.\n1966--72: The Churchill Chair;\nRedefinition
  There was a continuing concern to bring up the Lab's strength\nand, in particular,
  to restore its historic strength in statistics.\nEsso Petroleum Ltd seemed disposed
  to be helpful, and David Kendall had\nconversations with Leo Govier of that firm.
  Initial suggestions were\nmodest: that support might be provided for a Diploma student.
  A year or\nmore of discussion, back-reference and variation led to something\nstartingly
  more ambitious: Esso generously endowed the Churchill Chair\nin the Mathematics
  of Operations Research. This was to be located in\nthe Faculty of Mathematics; more
  specifically, in the Statistical\nLaboratory.  The new chair was advertised in 1966.
  Peter Whittle was\nelected to the post in August of that year and took up duties
  in July\n1967. The number of people in the UK who might be said to be\nknowledgeable
  in the mathematics of OR was small, but Whittle's\nincreasing interest in optimisation
  was deemed sufficiently qualifying,\nand made the move an appropriate one as far
  as he was concerned.  There may have been an expectation in some quarters that the\nnew
  professor would be, effectively, a professor of statistics, so\nrestoring the desired
  balance. However, Whittle saw the matter in a\nmore literal light. For one thing,
  Esso's intention was clearly that\nthe post should be in operational research. But,
  more than that,\nWhittle considered that what needed development was, not just\nnarrow-sense
  operational research, but the whole area for which there\nis still no good name,
  but which is variously called `applicable\nmathematics' or `non-physical applied
  mathematics'. This includes, for\nexample, probability, statistics, optimisation,
  systems theory, game\ntheory and those aspects of disciplines such as control theory,\ncommunication
  theory and mathematical economics which might be pursued\nby someone technically
  based in probability and optimisation.\nDevelopments in the USA since the war have
  demonstrated, not only the\npractical importance of these topics, but also the depth
  and coherence\nof the theory they generate.  Surprisingly, Cambridge was ready for
  these developments.\nBoth students and other Faculties had been pressing the Faculty
  of\nMathematics to modernise its coverage in precisely these areas, and the\nFaculty
  had conceded the case. So, the proposal of new Part II courses\n(in convex optimisation,
  dynamic optimisation and statistical\ncommunication theory, as it turned out) was
  welcomed, rather than met\nwith the incredulity and resistance which precedent would
  have led one\nto expect. The new courses had a chequered beginning, but ultimately\ntook
  shape and became accepted components of the Tripos. One may say\nthat the optimisation
  courses have not prospered as they should, but\nthe changes in courses and staff
  anticipated for 1994 promise\nregeneration.  Statisticians outside Cambridge may
  have watched the partial\ndisplacement of statistics in Cambridge by probability
  and\noptimisation, etc. with some dismay, seeing this as an abandonment of\nhonourable
  traditions or a snobbish mathematical elitism. They could\nnot be more wrong. There
  is surely substance in the view that the\ncomplacency lay outside Cambridge rather
  than\nwithin. The many departments of statistics in the country interpreted\ntheir
  brief far too narrowly - more narrowly than Galton or Fisher\nwould have found natural!
  It was Cambridge which saw the lack and tried\nto remedy it; a task requiring much
  hard work and inducing some\nhumility. Further, contrary to general belief, Cambridge
  has continued\nthroughout to recognise the special role of statistics and tried
  to\nrestore its own strength in this area. The attempt to cover much of\napplicable
  mathematics with a smaller staff than is devoted to\nstatistics alone in many universities
  has made this difficult. However,\nstrenuous efforts have been made to bring statistics
  to its proper\nrepresentation, and 1994 may see also these efforts crowned with\nsuccess.
  \ The visitors for the year 1967/8 included Ingram Olkin, Al\nMarshall, Mike Perlman
  and, again, Alfred R?nyi . Olkin and Marshall\nstarted a seminar series on inequalities,
  attended by R?nyi among\nothers. This was novel both in content and format: it provided
  the\nfirst local experience of a `bag seminar', to which one brought one's\nlunch.
  Ingram and Al presented their developing ideas on majorisation\nat this seminar,
  ideas which constituted the basis of their later text\non the subject. Al also took
  the chance to enlarge his collection of\nold flutes.  Anthony Edwards was attached
  to the Lab 1968/70, and began a\ncourse in Mathematical Genetics which remains a
  standing option in the\nDiploma, although Anthony sees this course as a development
  of on begun\nby Fisher and George Owen in 1952/3. While his primary interest is\nmathematical
  genetics, Anthony is a scholar of both statistical\ninference and the history of
  statistics in Cambridge; most of the\nformal record in sections 2, 3 and 5 of this
  account is derived from\nhis 1991 notes. His book Likelihood (1972,\nCambridge University
  Press) was written during his period of\nattachment. One may also see him as the
  high priest of those who tend\nthe memory of Fisher in the sacred groves of Caius
  (of which college\nFisher was a Fellow, as is Anthony). He read a paper to the Royal\nStatistical
  Society in 1969 on the estimation of evolutionary trees ( J.\nRoy. Statist. Soc.
  B (1970) 32\n, 155--208). Solution of this difficult and fascinating problem was\nlater
  taken considerably further by his research student, Elizabeth\nThompson. Robin Sibson
  tackled the same problem in a different way in\nhis study with Nick Jardine of dendrogram
  techniques (Jardine, N. and\nSibson, R. (1970) Mathematical Taxonomy, Wiley).\nBoth
  Elizabeth and Robin were appointed at that time to University\nLectureships in the
  Lab; Robin from 1970 and Elizabeth from 1971. This\nactivity again demonstrates
  the falsity of the impression that\nstatistics lapsed in the Lab after the fifties:
  the estimation of\nevolutionary trees is an important, subtle and difficult statistical\nproblem;
  exactly the kind of problem that many mainstream statisticians\nwill regard as lying
  outside their brief.  Books published by the staff must serve as an informative
  if\ninsufficient statistic of activity. Peter Whittle published Optimisation\nunder
  Constraints (1971, Wiley) as a text for one of the\noptimisation courses and Probability
  (1970,\nPenguin). Since this latter took the unconventional approach of\naxiomatising
  the expectation functional, it was unlikely to be adopted\nfor any course, but it
  was interestingly parallel to the work by de\nFinetti, appearing in English just
  at that time, which Dennis Lindley\nso espoused.  John Gittins was also loosely
  attached to the Lab in 1969/70.\nIt was at this time that he was developing his
  solution of the\nmulti-armed bandit problem, motivated by the need for a rational\napproach
  to the allocation of exploratory research effort he had\nencountered while working
  with Unilever. The multi-armed bandit problem\nwas the problem of decision theory
  over the years\n1945-1980; it embodies the essential problem of balancing\nexperimentation
  against immediate dividend, but seemed so difficult\nthat people of some mathematical
  sophistication regarded it as\nintrinsically insoluble in any conventional sense.
  Few would have\nbelieved it if they had been told in 1969 that John had slain the\ndragon.
  It would be 1979/80 before his classic advance was recognised,\nsince when it has
  transformed a large part of the subject of stochastic\nscheduling.  Violet Cane
  was instrumental in bringing in the rule that the\nHead of the new department, DPMMS,
  should be appointed for only five\nyears at a time, rather than until retirement.
  Thus it was that Sir\nWilliam Hodge yielded the Headship to Ian Cassels in 1969.
  \ The unlikely symbiosis of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical\nStatistics might
  not have succeeded but for Cassels' sympathetic and\nenlightened attitude. A distinguished
  number theorist himself, Cassels\ncould see, not only that a high proportion of
  the Faculty's graduates\nfound a career in statistics and related disciplines, but
  also that\nthese subjects were intrinsically interesting. Indeed, he was the first\nmathematician
  to give the Part II course in Mathematical Economics\n(previously given by a member
  of the Faculty of Economics), developing\nand publishing his own course text. It
  was Ian who repeatedly\nencouraged the Lab to think big. This venturesome attitude
  was in\ncontrast to his lesser concern for domestic matters. When money had to\nbe
  found it was always taken off the cleaning budget, which, despite\nits consequent
  exponential decline, always seemed to have some capacity\nfor sacrifice left in
  it.  In 1969 David McLaren left for a post in Glasgow;\ncross-border balance was
  preserved by recruitment of Ted Harding from\nEdinburgh. His was regarded as a post
  in statistics.  Robin Sibson was appointed in 1970 to a new University\nLectureship
  notionally assigned to Operational Research. He developed a\nlater interest in optimal
  experimental design, a subject experiencing a\nrenaissance at that time, and in
  which Cambridge, Imperial College and\nGlasgow for a while formed a triumvirate.
  All three groups enjoyed\nvisits from Valery Federov, who had just written his book
  on the\nsubject. The pleasantness of his company was not diminished by the\npossibility
  that he was perhaps more than a simple academic.  Another statistical appointment
  was made in 1970. Pat Altham\nwas appointed as Assistant Director of Research (ADR)
  and also given\nspecific responsibility for the running of the Diploma by being\nnominated
  Director of Studies. She had continued in these duties ever\nsince (although later
  as UL) and has become less dispensable than\nanybody should be allowed to be. As
  a relic of her ADRship Pat fields\nthe statistical queries that come in both from
  other departments and\nfrom outside the University, and herself deals with most
  of them. As\nDirector of Studies she does much of the teaching for the Diploma\nitself
  plus all of the administration: e.g. the organisation of\nadmissions, courses, examinations
  and applied projects. The project\nretains its central role in the Diploma course,
  but to find applied\nareas of the right level and interest equipped with a willing
  applied\nsupervisor is by no means easy. In fact, the scheme is workable only\nbecause
  of the contacts and goodwill Pat has built up through her\nconsultation work.  David
  Kendall's `fields of application' continued to be\narchaeology and astronomy, but
  there were outliers. A pig-breeder\ncalled to see him, and David listened, silently
  but sympathetically, to\na long discourse on swine fever. At the end of this his
  client rose and\nthanked him cordially for a most valuable discussion. Years later
  the\nsame man wrote, recalling the conversation and thanking David profusely\nfor
  opening his mind to totally new insights on the question of swine\nfever.  The Laboratory
  suffered a sad loss in the summer of 1970 by\nthe death of Rollo Davidson in a climbing
  accident in the Alps. Rollo\nhad been a research student in the Lab, had held a
  Junior Research\nFellowship at Trinity and just been elected to a Teaching Fellowship
  at\nChurchill. He was regarded as being of quite exceptional promise. Rollo\nhad
  published on Delphic semi-groups, p-functions and stochastic\ngeometry, and was
  beginning to pose questions in statistics and\noptimisation. The talent that had
  been lost was commemorated by the\ncompilation of two memorial volumes (eds. Kendall
  and Harding, 1973 and\n1974). The income from these was used to found the Rollo
  Davidson\nTrust, from which prizes for distinguished research by younger workers\nhave
  been awarded annually since 1976.  A course introduced about this time was based
  on a suggestion\nof Rollo's, which he would have developed himself had he lived.
  This\nwas the `Markov methods' course in Part IB. A need was felt for a\nprobability
  course of an applied character; to build it around the\nMarkov theme gave a natural
  lead into stochastic processes. As nobility\nis said to need the constant (if covert)
  infusion of common blood to\nmaintain its vigour, so probability courses need a
  constant reminder of\napplications if they are not to waft themselves to Gallic
  heights and\ndisappear. This seems to be a law of nature, and is the reason why\nprobability
  is too important to be left to the probabilists.  In 1971 Violet Cane left for the
  Manchester chair. She was\nreplaced by Elizabeth Thompson, a formidable young lady
  who handled all\nthe statistics courses with laconic ease. Elizabeth naturally took
  over\nthe Mathematical Genetics course as well, and tackled the Communication\nTheory
  course (which a few loved and most would not touch) with relish\n-- perhaps because
  it gave her a chance to talk about DNA sequences.\nHer work on inference problems
  for evolutionary trees continued; in\n1975 she was to publish Human Evolutionary
  Trees\n(Cambridge University Press).7.\n1972-85 Comings and goings\n \nThe terms
  of the Chair of Mathematical Statistics made the Professor ex\nofficio Director
  of the Laboratory. However, these had been\nformulated in the days when the Laboratory
  had but one chair. Perhaps\nDavid Kendall was aware of the belief that eleven or
  twelve years is\nthe maximal natural term of office; in any case, in 1973 he managed
  to\nhave the tie loosed and Peter Whittle appointed as Director.\n The new stage
  was set in the pleasantest fashion by the\nappointment of Geoff Eagleson to a ULship
  and the appearance of Bruce\nBrown as a visitor in 1972. Geoff Eagleson played a
  profoundly positive\nrole in the Laboratory; in teaching, research, student contact
  and the\ngood thrift of the Laboratory generally. When one thinks back to the\nfounding
  fathers of the Laboratory, one regards them as examples of\nancient virtue which
  cannot be equalled. However, in dedication and\ncharacter Geoff equalled anybody.
  He is one of a whole sequence of\nAustralians who have contributed to the Laboratory's
  life and success.\nBruce Brown was conspicuously another, but one thinks particularly
  of\nthe magnificent succession of research students: Daryl Daley, John\nPollard,
  Richard Tweedie, Tim Brown, Iain MacPhee, Phil Pollett, Adrian\nBaddeley, Alan Branford,
  Steve Evans, Ben Hambly, Terence Chan, Steve\nHanly, Nigel Bean, Jo Kennedy and
  Owen Jones. These were all good, some\nof them the very best, and they have kept
  the Lab's graduate research\ngoing at times when UK recruitment was thin. After
  all these years one\nmay reveal a fact known to Charles Goldie: that John Pollard
  secretly\ndoubled up his studies for his Ph.D. and his actuarial examinations.  In
  fact, recruitment was by no means thin in the early/mid\nseventies, which was one
  of those periods when the research-student\ngroup developed a particularly vivid
  and productive life of its own.\nOne recalls David Aldous, Frank Kelly, John Kent,
  Bill McGinley, David\nProbert, Brian Ripley, Jeremy Rudge and Bernie Silverman.
  \ Geoff Eagleson worked closely with Andrew Barbour, who had\nbeen associated with
  the Lab from 1969; successively as Diploma\nstudent, research student, Fellow of
  Caius and Director of Studies for\nthat college. Andrew made a succession of strong
  advances in\nprobability on the pure/applied borderline. His talents were recognised\nadequately
  first when he was appointed to a chair in Z?rich in 1984.  Ian Cassels' continued
  exhortation and support bore fruit in\n1974 in the form of another Lectureship,
  to be notionally assigned to\nOperational Research. Doug Kennedy was appointed;
  immediately from\nSheffield but, before that, from Trinity College Dublin and Stanford.\nWith
  his Stanford background Doug was the only staff member with any\nformal OR training.
  \ Life was enriched when Wally Smith, Joel Cohen and John\nHajnal spent a sabbatical
  year at the Lab in 1974/5 and Henry Daniels\nin 1975/6. It was a particular pleasure
  to have Henry and Wally back -\na link with the St Andrew's Hill days. Henry divided
  his time between\nthe Lab and the King's College Research Centre, where he was charged\nwith
  the organisation of a seminar in mathematical biology.  Various references have
  been made to the less than palatial\nhousing of the Department. In this connection,
  Kevin Donnelly (research\nstudent 1976/9, now answering to Caoimhin O Donnaile)
  tells how he\nfound Thomas Bruss (research student from Germany, now in Brussels)\ntaking
  a photograph of the main entry to the Department, a warehouse\nback-door flanked
  by milk-bottles and randomly-packed bicycles. He\nintended to send this to his parents,
  who could not otherwise be\nconvinced that such a prestigious department was to
  be approached\nthrough such portals. Kevin also tells a story which charity bids
  us\ndismiss as apocryphal. One student was heard asking another the purpose\nof
  the gigantic rubbish bins outside the actual back-door of the\nDepartment. His friend
  explained that these were for discarded notes\nand that ``they are sometimes picked
  through by Oxford research\nstudents desperate for material for their theses''.
  \ Alistair Mees was appointed to a ULship in 1975, again\nnotionally allocated to
  Operational Research. It was always difficult\nto find staff in OR; since there
  were virtually no mathematically\nadvanced courses in OR in the country very few
  had such a training.\nWith luck one could find someone with USA training (as in
  Doug\nKennedy's case) or else someone of approximating interests and\nsufficient
  enthusiasm to bridge the gap (as in Robin Sibson's case).\nThe latter was the case
  also for Alistair. He had worked in control\ntheory, largely in the analysis of
  nonlinear systems, and later won an\nAdams Prize for his essay Dynamics of Feedback
  Systems\nem> (Wiley, 1981). While maintaining his interest in nonlinear\ndynamics
  he also moved seriously and permanently into optimisation and\nassociated algorithmics.
  \ Jim Pitman was appointed to a ULship in 1976, bringing both\nthe highest standards
  in probability and an honoured name. Jim's\nnatural sphere is the USA and in 1978
  he returned to Berkeley. He was\nreplaced by the appointment of Frank Kelly to a
  ULship. This meant\nreiving a valued young member of staff from the Control and
  Management\nStudies Group of the Department of Engineering, but its Head, Alastair\nMacFarlane,
  bore no grudge. Relations of the Lab with the Department of\nEngineering have always
  been good, particularly with Control\nEngineering and with Management Studies (which
  for a time had a joint\nexistence but are now again separate). There are natural
  communities of\ninterest, of course, although this is in general no guarantee of\namicability,
  and there has been movement of members between the groups\nin both directions (e.g.
  John Gittins, Stephen Watson, Frank Kelly and\nRichard Weber).  Frank's return was
  to have profound long-term consequences\nfor the Lab. It was a return, because Frank
  had been a Ph.D. student in\nthe Lab 1973/6. He had been supervised by Peter Whittle
  in the area of\nJackson networks, with its associated reversibility and balance\nconcepts.
  This class of ideas turned out to be butter to Frank's\nremarkable intuition. Frank
  achieved extensions of the Jackson theory\nnot only for the queueing context but
  also for other and apparently\nunrelated application areas. His book Reversibility
  and\nStochastic Networks (Wiley, 1979) demonstrated the striking\nunification thus
  achieved, and made Frank's name instantaneously.  The tempo seemed to increase in
  those years. Peter Whittle\nwas elected FRS in 1978. His discovery in 1979 of an
  alternative proof\nof the optimality of the Gittins index policy for the multi-armed\nbandit
  problem had the effect of bringing about the long-overdue\nrecognition of John Gittins'
  solution of the problem.  Retiring professors were also beginning to home back to
  the\nLab: Henry Daniels from Birmingham in 1978 and Violet Cane from\nManchester
  in 1981. That Violet should return was expected, since she\nhad kept her cottage
  in Little St Mary's Lane. However, that Henry\nshould wish to do so was both surprising
  and gratifying. Henry had a\nrespect for red-brick virtues and found these notably
  lacking in\nCambridge; the college slights of earlier years still rankled. However,\nperhaps
  he found some of the Lab's work in applied probability to his\ntaste. The reverse
  compliment certainly holds; he is held in high\nregard and affection, and is doughty
  enough in controversy to be\nallowed no quarter, despite his age. He was elected
  FRS in 1980,\nbringing the Lab count to three. Belated but generous justice was\nachieved
  by David Williams in 1992, when Henry was made an Honorary\nFellow of Clare.  Manfred
  Gordon, a polymer chemist who had published classic\nwork on the statistics of polymers
  with Jack Good, had been a visitor\nin the Lab 1972/3. In 1978 he retired from Essex
  and also took up\nresidence in the Lab. Manfred had hoped that the interest in the\nprobabilistic
  aspects of polymerisation which he shared with Peter\nWhittle would form the basis
  for some real programme. Alas, the\nLaboratory was in its familiar quandary of having
  to split its limited\nhuman capital too many ways, and simply could not afford this
  venture.\nInterestingly, B?la Bollob?s and his stable of random graph theorists\nwere
  working along parallel lines, although in a style different enough\nthat collaboration
  was never natural. However, Manfred, even if\ndisappointed, continues to illuminate
  the Lab with his gentle erudition\nand wide culture.  Martin Barlow was appointed
  to a ULship in 1982. He\nreinforced the extraordinarily high quality of the group,
  many of them\nresearch students, working on stochastic integrals, stochastic\ndifferential
  equations and flows and spatial processes on strange\nmanifolds.  In 1983 there
  was a contentious move, in a literal sense. The\nDPMMS library, which had been housed
  on the first floor of the DPMMS\nbuilding, was moved into the library vacated by
  the Faculty of Classics\nat the top of the Mill Lane Lecture Block, just over the
  road. The old\nquarters had been cramped; the new quarters are not merely roomy,
  but\nalso beautiful. The former Classics Library is light, lofty and\nelegant; a
  sequence of two-tiered galleried bays in light oak is\nsuffused by a clear natural
  light from above. Undoubtedly some\nconvenience has been lost in the translation,
  probably more from the\nvertical component than the horizontal one. However, this
  is perhaps\none case when academics' known inability to refuse an offer has led
  to\nthe right outcome.  Publications again: in 1981 Elizabeth Thompson published
  Genealogical\nand Genetic Structure with Chris Cannings (Cambridge\nUniversity Press)
  and in 1982/3 Peter Whittle published the two-volume Optimisation\nover Time (Wiley).
  \ There were a number of losses in 1984. The Lab lost a friend\nin office when Ian
  Cassels retired. Martin Barlow resigned to\nconcentrate on research, and Alistair
  Mees resigned to take up a chair\nin Western Australia.  With the loss of Alistair
  the difficulty of finding an OR\nreplacement had again to be faced. It was solved
  by the appointment of\nColin Sparrow, highly regarded for his work in nonlinear
  dynamics,\nnotably chaos theory. Colin's actions are based on pragmatism and\nprinciple;
  convention is not so much disregarded as irrelevant. To fill\na longish gap between
  graduation and the securing of a post in King's\nhe had driven a bus in Cambridge
  and had sold ice-cream on King's\nParade (wearing a top-hat, to the tourists' delight).
  The appointment\nstretched the range of interests represented in the Laboratory
  by more\nthan was wise or comfortable, but the Lab has benefited greatly from\nColin's
  idiosyncratic virtues.8.\n1985--92 Martingales and the Mabinogion\n\nDavid Kendall
  was due to retire in 1985. The usual measures were taken\nto advertise the post,
  in the sober and sincere intention that a\ngenuine statistician should be appointed
  if possible. However, that the\nLab is part of the Faculty of Mathematics places
  its own constraints.\nOne has to meet the standards of the Faculty (the students
  would be\nmerciless towards anyone who did not) and the Lab now had its own\ndeveloped
  standards as a group in applicable mathematics. It is perhaps not divulging too
  much to say that there were\ntwo very strong statistical figures in the running;
  one of these\nultimately withdrew and the other presented special problems. The\nElectors
  were then faced with a rerun of the 1962 scenario; David\nWilliams was so clearly
  the strongest residual candidate that he was\nelected. He then joined the Laboratory
  in 1985. Two others effectively\ncame with him from Swansea; Chris Rogers was appointed
  as a UL and, in\n1986, James Norris to a New Blood post as UAL. With these two\nappointments
  the strength of the Lab in pure probability was clearly\nmaintained, and its average
  age decreased.  David Williams brought the highest degree of professional\nstrength,
  together with a particular warmth and generosity of\npersonality. Sensitive to the
  possible charge of mathematical\npreciousness (which he of all people could have
  disregarded) he\nlectured and supervised a whole range of courses in probability
  and\nstatistics. He gave two graduate lecture series (Connections and\nPercolation)
  which bridged probability, modern physics and pure\nmathematics with rare power
  and evoked sustained interest from the\nstaff of the whole Faculty. His breadth
  manifested itself in the truest\nfashion; students left David's courses knowing
  something of the\nMabinogion as well as of martingales.  In retirement David Kendall
  developed his study of\nstanding-stone configurations into a `theory of shape',
  working with a\nvery bright visitor from mainland China: Huiling Le. In the following\nyears
  he was awarded the Royal Statistical Society's Guy Medal in Gold\nand the De Morgan
  Medal of the London Mathematical Society,\ncomplementing the Sylvester Medal already
  awarded by the Royal Society.\nHowever, David maintains that it is his founding
  of the Bernoulli\nSociety, jointly with Jerzy Neyman, which gives him the greatest\nsatisfaction.
  \ David Kendall continued to occupy a room in the Lab and use\ncomputing facilities.
  University departments vary widely in their\npractice towards retired members. University
  policy must of course be\nthat they have no rights, and departments under the severest
  resource\npressures must also see it this way. However, groups which consider\nthat
  they can both stretch resources and avoid the problems an\ninsensitive senior retir?
  might pose do in fact offer a continuing\nhome. Henry Daniels had been given a room
  on this basis, as David was\nnow. Violet Cane and Manfred Gordon had received partial
  facilities on\nthe same basis. One must not see this practice as resting on pure\ncharity
  or sentiment; the `Advanced Fellows' offer depth to the group\nin several ways,
  and their presence is often particularly appreciated\nby the youngest members of
  the group: the graduate students. One might\nalso say that any other attitude would
  scarcely be consistent with a\nhealthy feeling of group identity.  It was in 1986
  that Elizabeth Thompson published her Pedigree\nAnalysis in Human Genetics (Johns
  Hopkins Press) and then\nresigned to take a chair of statistics at the University
  of Washington.\nIt was a pity to lose her from the Lab, but a greater pity to lose
  her\nfrom the country. She had applied for chairs of statistics in the UK,\nbut
  committees with a narrow concept of statistics appointed candidates\nclearly her
  inferior.  As argued earlier, books published by the staff do not\nreflect everything,
  but they must reflect something. In 1986 Wiley\npublished Peter Whittle's Systems
  in Stochastic Equilibrium\nand in 1987 the revision by Chris Rogers and David Williams
  of Vol. 2\nof David's Diffusions, Markov Processes and Martingales.\nTo anticipate
  somewhat, in 1990 Wiley published Peter Whittle's Risk-sensitive\nOptimal Control
  and in 1991 Cambridge University Press\nbrought out two sets of lecture notes based
  on existing Part II\ncourses. These were Communication Theory (Charles\nGoldie and
  Richard Pinch) and Probability with Martingales\n(David Williams).  A very significant
  and encouraging development was the\nemergence in 1985 of the Stochastic Networks
  Group. Frank Kelly's\ninterest in queueing networks had developed, through a contact
  with\nBritish Telecom which was later formalised, into an interest in\ncommunication
  networks. Communication and computer specialists\nworldwide were beginning to recognise
  that such systems generate\ninteresting and difficult stochastic problems, with
  optimisation (or at\nleast good performance) very much a consideration. Frank had
  attracted\nsome very good students to this field early in the decade (e.g. Iain\nMacPhee
  and Ilze Ziedins). However, by the mid-eighties a very bright\nand substantial group
  had been formed by the arrival of Richard\nGibbens, Graham Louth, Phil Hunt and
  Neil Laws; this was reinforced by\nthe development of a close working relationship
  with British Telecom.\nThe group now constituted itself the Stochastic Networks
  Group. It also\nprovided the first case in which the Lab had clearly achieved critical\nmass
  on any research topic. Over the years a modest staff had been\ntrying to cover a
  wide field, with the result that real concentration\nwas reached on no single topic.
  The critical local density was now\nachieved for the first time. Moreover, the group
  was answering an\nadvanced technological need at just the right time. The introduction
  of\nelectronic telephone exchanges means that, for example, new\ncall-routing methods
  are both possible and necessary. Frank Kelly and\nRichard Gibbens evolved the Dynamic
  Alternative Routing scheme, which\nprovides near-optimal performance by simple means
  and has since been\nput into practice by British Telecom. This is only an example
  of the\ntype of challenge large systems are offering. The Stochastic Networks\nGroup
  (and with it the Lab), although small enough in all conscience,\nnow has a high
  international reputation in the study of communications\nnetworks. It is likely
  that an Institute of Telecommunications will be\nfounded in the University of Cambridge
  in the near future, supported by\nindustry, with the Stochastic Networks Group as
  one of its prime\ncomponents.  The impression created by the many references to
  the\nBrunsviga should now be corrected; computing facilities in the Lab have\nof
  course kept pace with the times. They are used as a teaching adjunct\nonly for the
  Diploma practical class and occasional other courses, such\nas the multivariate
  analysis class. However, everybody computes, of\ncourse, and reactionaries who do
  not have this basic skill are now so\nrare as to be acquiring antiquity value.  The
  manual Brunsvigas continued in class use until at least\n1947/8, although being
  progressively replaced by electromechanical\nmachines from about 1944. By 1964 the
  mainframe Titan was then also\navailable, using autocode and paper tape. Hewlett-Packard
  pocket\ncalculators were adopted in 1973, followed by programmable calculators\nin
  the late seventies. Fortran was by now used for calculations on the\nIBM mainframe.
  In 1983 the change was made to BBC micros, using a Torch\ndisc drive, BASIC, and
  with Glim available on disc. Statistical\npackages also became available on the
  mainframe: SAD, BMDP, Genstat and\nSPSS. Computing power in the Lab was greatly
  enhanced in 1987 by\nHewlett-Packard's donation of several Unix work-stations. It
  was the\nmanifest success of the Stochastic Networks Group which prompted\nHewlett-Packard
  to make this generous and much-appreciated gift. These\nwork-stations were linked;
  about this time the ethernet local area\nnetwork was installed throughout the Lab.
  Now, in 1993, the network is\nbeing greatly enhanced, with the provision of X-windows
  and packages\nsuch as Splus, Glim and Mathematica.  A refreshing interlude was provided
  in 1986/7 by David Banks,\nwho gave highly appreciated and capable relief teaching
  in statistics\nfor the year. David came from Berkeley and returned to Carnegie-Mellon,\nand
  it was he who made us realise what a positive benefit such a\n`casual' can be. In
  both classroom and commonroom David at once fitted\nin and brought a breath of fresh
  air; we feel that he left us rather\nthan that he visited us.  There were various
  developments in 1987. One was David\nWilliams' resigned assumption of the Directorship.
  Another was the\nRoyal Statistical Society's celebration of its Charter Centenary
  by a\nthree-day meeting in Cambridge (more particularly, in the Cambridge\nUnion).
  The Lab provided local organisation, a task it carried out\nwillingly and enjoyed.
  Finally, there was a welcome accession of\nstrength on the statistical side with
  the appointment of Alastair Young\nto a UALship. He and Henry Daniels cooperated
  on a mathematical\nevaluation of the bootstrap method.  Peter Whittle was awarded
  an SERC Senior Fellowship for the\nyears 1988/91 to enable him to work on another
  variety of networks:\nneural networks. The consequent necessity of finding a temporary\nteaching
  replacement again provided a bonus. Charles Goldie was\nappointed for a two-year
  period which was, reasonably enough, as much\nabsence as the University of Sussex
  would allow him. Charles proved\neager and capable in high degree. He took on the
  courses in convex\noptimisation and communication theory, which were quite new to
  him,\nwith enthusiasm and thoroughness. An byproduct in the second case was\nthe
  CUP course text, already mentioned, written with Richard Pinch.  There was little
  expectation that one would find a third-year\nreplacement to match Charles, who
  had been the happiest solution in\nevery respect. However, Yurii Suhov, from Moscow,
  showed interest. He\nhad already visited the Lab and, with his background in statistical\ncommunication
  theory among other things, seemed a very good bet,\nalthough obviously in some respects
  an outside one. Visa trouble\ndelayed him in Dublin until late January 1991, which
  made him thrice\nwelcome when he came. He was appointed to a regular ULship later
  that\nyear. Yurii brings skill in the applications of probability to\nstatistical
  physics; also the well-known strengths of the mathematical\nculture in which he
  was brought up.  In 1989 Frank Kelly was elected an FRS; a happy development\nin
  itself, and one which brought the Lab's tally to five (Henry Daniels\nand David
  Kendall being assuredly counted always as Lab members). This\nwas followed by his
  appointment to a personal chair.  Chris Rogers left in 1991 for a chair at Queen
  Mary and\nWestfield College, London, joining Charles Goldie there. Chris had been\na
  great enthusiast for all stochastic analysis related to Brownian\nmotion. In recent
  years he had also developed an interest in\napplications: to some part in statistical
  consultancy but to some part\nalso in financial modelling. The quite sophisticated
  mathematical\nanalysis of option-pricing and the like has engaged the attention
  of\nmany probabilists over recent years: in Cambridge, of Chris Rogers,\nDoug Kennedy
  and David Williams. In 1993/4 it will find its way into a\nPart II course.  Chris
  Rogers was replaced (although the correspondence\nbetween resignations and appointments
  is inexact) by the appointment of\nGareth Roberts as a UAL in 1992. Gareth's background
  was originally in\nprobability, but he had moved much more into statistics while
  at\nNottingham with Adrian Smith.  In 1991 David Williams resigned from his chair,\ncharacteristically
  giving for notice as much time as would be needed to\nfind his replacement. He had
  made earlier resignation attempts,\nalleging his own inadequacy for the post, a
  charge so ludicrous that\nwords could scarcely be found to counter it. David Kendall
  and Peter\nWhittle had baulked these by writing independently to the\nVice-Chancellor
  and asserting (sincerely and without collusion) that\nDavid Williams was the best
  Director the Laboratory had ever had.\nHowever, he was now resolved. His real reasons
  were perhaps the obvious\nones: a weariness with administration, a desire to get
  more of his own\nwork done, and hiraeth -- longing for Wales. However, strangely,
  and as\nno one in Cambridge had realised, when David left Swansea in 1985 he\nhad
  announced to the Senate there that he intended to occupy the\nCambridge post for
  just seven years.  The fixity of David's decision was recognised, and Frank\nKelly
  took over the Directorship in 1991. The intention that David\nshould thus be spared
  worry in his last year at Cambridge was not in\nfact fulfilled; the difficulties
  of house-moving had reached their\nnow-familiar intensity, and David suffered serious
  health problems. It\nwas with great regret that the Lab saw him depart in 1992;
  an era of\nparticular warmth and vitality had closed. 9.\n1992--:Regeneration\n\nDavid
  Williams had given the Electors good time in which to replace\nhim, and the same
  care was taken to prepare a good field as in 1985,\nwith the same genuine anxiety
  to do right by statistics. However, to\nthe outside observer the election also provided
  a re-run of history.\nSeveral outstandingly strong probabilists had applied; the
  statistical\nfield was sound, but less outstanding, even if one measured each of
  the\ntwo fields by the world standards of its own discipline. The\nstatisticians
  were certainly given a margin of preference; against this\none must perhaps reckon
  an anxiety that the existing strengths of the\nLaboratory should not be gratuitously
  jeopardised.\n The outcome was that Geoffrey Grimmett was elected; he left\nBristol
  and took up his post in October of 1992. Geoffrey had made a\nvery strong name in
  the study of percolation processes and of random\ngraphs, interests which abut those
  of several in the Lab and the\nUniversity.  The long-felt unease within the Laboratory
  itself that the\nsubject of statistics was inadequately represented was now supplemented\nby
  a growing realisation that the regime in which the Lab's first chair\ncontinued
  to be filled by a probabilist might be self-perpetuating, and\nindeed that such
  a pattern might not even be unreasonable if the Lab's\nexisting strength in the
  central topic of probability was to be\npreserved. Moves were then set afoot to
  establish a third chair, to be\ncalled the Chair of Statistics or whichever variant
  would emphasise its\nprotected nature: that it should under no circumstances be
  filled by\nany other than a genuine statistician.  The course of this last election
  reinforced the unease;\nindeed, the conscience of some of the Electors was appeased
  only by the\nundertaking from John Coates, now the Head of DPMMS, that the proposed\nChair
  of Statistics would be the top Faculty priority. This is no light\nundertaking,
  but John, whose understanding and support for the Lab have\nmatched those of Ian
  Cassels, gave it unequivocally. It was further\ndecided that the search for suitable
  candidates for the new chair would\nbe undertaken much more deliberately and systematically
  than is the\nCambridge habit: that a Search Committee would be formed to actively\nbeat
  the world of statistics, and that the members of this committee\nwould ultimately
  form the nucleus of the Board of Electors. At the time\nof writing the case for
  the establishment of the Chair has just been\naccepted by the General Board of the
  University, and it is hoped that\nthe post will be filled by October 1994.  Despite
  the great widening of its interests, the Laboratory\nremains the Statistical Laboratory
  and the Diploma remains the Diploma\nin Mathematical Statistics. However inadequate
  these may now seem as\ndescriptions, the feeling has been that to change them would
  be like\ntrying to doctor one's foundation stone. It is believed on the other\nhand
  that they constitute no false claim.  In particular, the term `Operational Research'
  has not crept\ninto either title. For reasons which would take too long to recount,
  OR\nactivity in the Lab has been even more divorced from the activity of\nthe `OR
  community' than has been the corresponding case in statistics.\nNevertheless, it
  is notable that the Lab has supplied the only winners\nin the UK (and among the
  few in Europe) of the Lanchester Prize of the\nOperational Research Society of America:
  Peter Whittle in 1987 and\nFrank Kelly in 1992. Perhaps the term `operational research'
  is no\nlonger a fair description of what one is trying to do; something like\n`the
  mathematics of systems' may be nearer.  The success of the Laboratory depends on
  all its staff and\nthe depth they supply; to measure the state of the Laboratory
  by the\nstate of its professorial staff would be invidious and misleading.\nNevertheless,
  the fact that the Statistical Laboratory has now\nprogressed to a professorial staff
  of four does underline the great\nchange in its circumstances since the fifties,
  and the composition of\nthis staff signals rejuvenescence and promise. Frank Kelly
  and Geoffrey\nGrimmett are both young and of high international reputation. If,
  as\none may reasonably expect, they are matched by those soon to be elected\nto
  the Churchill Chair and to the new Chair of Statistics, then,\nwhatever the Lab
  does in the coming years, it will lead.10. References"
