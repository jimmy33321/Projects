- "            How do historians, at least in the anglophone West, make history? By
  that I mean what consequences flow from the fact that all the events and processes
  in 'the past', are 'turned' by the historian into that narrative we call history?
  The debate on this 'narrative' or 'linguistic turn' - the recognition that history
  is a narrative about the past written in the here and now, rather than some distanced
  mirror of it - has been a significant issue within the profession for several years.
  What are some of the consequences that flow from this view of history as a narrative
  about the past constructed by the historian in the present?\r\n"
- "Much of the debate on viewing history, as the narrative construction of the historian,
  is whether this judgement distorts what history is, what historians do, and it reflects
  upon the objectivity and truth-seeking nature of the exercise. As a writer of history
  it is my conclusion that the linguistic turn - the essential element in the postmodern
  challenge to a view of history founded solely on the empirical-analytical model
  - is no threat to the study of the past. This is not because it does not fundamentally
  change how we think about history - I think it can - but it offers the opportunity
  to redefine what we do and broaden the scope of our activities. \r\n"
- "How do historians gain historical knowledge? It is assumed in every historical
  narrative that form always follows content. What this means is that the historical
  narrative must always be transparent in referring to what actually happened according
  to the evidence. As Voltaire said, and most conventionally trained historians might
  still agree, 'too many metaphors are hurtful...to truth, by saying more or less
  than the thing itself' (quoted in White 1973: 53). To get at the thing itself, objectivity
  is the aim and this demands the referential language of historians. With this aim
  and this tool we can infer the realities beneath the misleading world of appearances.
  To the Western modernist Enlightenment-inspired mind objectivity and the historical
  narrative must remain compatible.\r\n"
- "The nineteenth century European critique of that vision, particularly in the work
  of Hegel and Nietzsche, moved beyond how knowledge is derived, to concentrate more
  how it is represented, and the effects the process of representation has upon the
  status and nature of our knowledge. This debate about knowing and telling within
  the European-American discipline of history continued into the last century in the
  work of many historian-philosophers: initially Benedetto Croce and R.G. Collingwood
  then, among many others, Carl Hempel, Ernest Nagel, Patrick Gardiner, and later
  Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Hayden White.\r\n"
- "The study of the past has never been static. The practice of history has witnessed
  many shifts and turns in the way it is thought and undertaken. Since the 1960s,
  for example, the discipline of history has experienced a 'social science turn',
  a 'cliometric' or 'statistics turn', a 'women's history turn', a 'cultural history
  turn' and so on. These are not novelties that have not come and gone. Each has remained
  a significant way for historians to reflect upon and write about change over time.
  But, in all this one thing has apparently not altered. This is the epistemology
  of history. In spite of this rich variety of methodological developments or shifts
  and turns of interest, the foundational way historians 'know' things about the past'
  has been unchallenged. Despite the use of statistics, the new themes (society, women,
  gender, culture) and the application of fresh concepts and theories, there remain
  two steady points in the historian's cosmos: empiricism and rational analysis. As
  the product of the European eighteenth-century Enlightenment the empirical-analytical
  model has become the epistemology for undertaking the study of the past.\r\n"
- "However, since the 1960s and 1970s something has changed at this epistemological
  level. Doubts about the empirical-analytical as the privileged path to historical
  knowing have emerged. This has not happened in history alone, of course. In all
  the arts, humanities, social sciences, and even the physical and life sciences the
  question is increasingly being put, how can we be sure that empiricism and inference
  really does get us close to the true meaning of the past? In history how can we
  trust our sources - not because they are forgeries or missing, but because of the
  claims empiricism is forced to make about our ability not only to find the data,
  but also just as importantly represent their meaning accurately? It is not an abstract
  or scholastic philosophical question to ask, where does meaning come from in history?
  Is it the past itself? Is its meaning simply ushered in by the historian. Is the
  historian merely the midwife to the truth of the past? Or is the historian unavoidably
  implicated in the creation of a meaning for the past. Does the past contain one
  true meaning or several? Is there one story to be discovered or several that can
  be legitimately generated? I think most historians today would agree on the latter
  analysis. The difference comes over the consequences of that implication, and what
  it does for truth. In other words is it the historian who provides the truth of
  the past as she represents it rather than as she finds it? This is the essence of
  the postmodern challenge, the turn to the narrative-linguistic and its implications.\r\n"
- "What makes this turn more significant than the others is that it demonstrates a
  deeper change in our views concerning the conditions under which we create historical
  knowledge. In other words it has challenged history not with new topics or methods
  as such, but by confronting the discipline's empirical-analytical foundations. The
  linguistic turn in history, of course, continues to rely on the empirical-analytical
  model, but it extends the our epistemology to include its narrative-linguistic representation,
  the form we give to the past within our texts, and it accepts history as an essentially
  literary activity, one that is self-evidently authored. The emphasis now is less
  on history as a process of objective discovery and report but, rather, accepts its
  unavoidably fictive nature, that is, its literary constructedness. By this I mean
  recognising the figurative assumptions that underpin authorial activity in creating
  the text and which are already (in a pre-empirical sense) and necessarily brought
  to the historical field, often determining the selection of evidence and its most
  likely meaning. This is a process that is revealed by the complex analysis of authorial
  activity.\r\n"
- "Postmodern history, because it is a literary as much as an empirical project, recognises
  it cannot escape its authorship. In other words, the past is not just re-interpreted
  according to new evidence but also through self-conscious acts of re-writing as
  well. Thus it is that history and the past cannot coincide to the extent that the
  former, whether we like it or not, is principally a narrative about the latter.
  Arguably there are no original centres of meaning to be found outside the narrative-linguistic.
  Data in and of itself does not have given meaning. Though empirical and analytical,
  postmodern history deliberately draws our attention to the conditions under which
  we create knowledge, in the case of history its nature as a series of forms, or
  turns perhaps, of a realist literature? In a very real sense the postmodern challenge
  forces us to face up to the highly complex question of how we know things about
  the past and what we, as moral beings, do as a result.\r\n"
- "In other words, it extends the remit of history to include the historian's pre-narrative
  assumptions and how we translate those assumptions figuratively as we construct
  our strategies of narrative explanation. Postmodern historians thus ask many fresh
  questions. Are facts best thought of as events under a description? Is all data
  ultimately textual and, if so, what are its implications? Should history be written
  primarily according to literary rules and, if so, what are they? What is the significant
  difference between literary and figurative speech in history and how does it create
  historical meaning? How do we distinguish the historical referent of a discourse
  and its constructed, i.e., its ideological, meaning? Can history ever exist beyond
  discourse? And the very big question, is history what happened, or what historians
  tell us happened? All these have to be addressed when we do history, to ignore them
  is to do only half the job. \r\n"

  Alun Munslow\r\n            How do historians, at least in the anglophone West,
  make history? By that I mean what consequences flow from the fact that all the events
  and processes in 'the past', are 'turned' by the historian into that narrative we
  call history? The debate on this 'narrative' or 'linguistic turn' - the recognition
  that history is a narrative about the past written in the here and now, rather than
  some distanced mirror of it - has been a significant issue within the profession
  for several years. What are some of the consequences that flow from this view of
  history as a narrative about the past constructed by the historian in the present?\r\nMuch
  of the debate on viewing history, as the narrative construction of the historian,
  is whether this judgement distorts what history is, what historians do, and it reflects
  upon the objectivity and truth-seeking nature of the exercise. As a writer of history
  it is my conclusion that the linguistic turn - the essential element in the postmodern
  challenge to a view of history founded solely on the empirical-analytical model
  - is no threat to the study of the past. This is not because it does not fundamentally
  change how we think about history - I think it can - but it offers the opportunity
  to redefine what we do and broaden the scope of our activities. \r\nHow do historians
  gain historical knowledge? It is assumed in every historical narrative that form
  always follows content. What this means is that the historical narrative must always
  be transparent in referring to what actually happened according to the evidence.
  As Voltaire said, and most conventionally trained historians might still agree,
  'too many metaphors are hurtful...to truth, by saying more or less than the thing
  itself' (quoted in White 1973: 53). To get at the thing itself, objectivity is the
  aim and this demands the referential language of historians. With this aim and this
  tool we can infer the realities beneath the misleading world of appearances. To
  the Western modernist Enlightenment-inspired mind objectivity and the historical
  narrative must remain compatible.\r\nThe nineteenth century European critique of
  that vision, particularly in the work of Hegel and Nietzsche, moved beyond how knowledge
  is derived, to concentrate more how it is represented, and the effects the process
  of representation has upon the status and nature of our knowledge. This debate about
  knowing and telling within the European-American discipline of history continued
  into the last century in the work of many historian-philosophers: initially Benedetto
  Croce and R.G. Collingwood then, among many others, Carl Hempel, Ernest Nagel, Patrick
  Gardiner, and later Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Hayden White.\r\nThe study
  of the past has never been static. The practice of history has witnessed many shifts
  and turns in the way it is thought and undertaken. Since the 1960s, for example,
  the discipline of history has experienced a 'social science turn', a 'cliometric'
  or 'statistics turn', a 'women's history turn', a 'cultural history turn' and so
  on. These are not novelties that have not come and gone. Each has remained a significant
  way for historians to reflect upon and write about change over time. But, in all
  this one thing has apparently not altered. This is the epistemology of history.
  In spite of this rich variety of methodological developments or shifts and turns
  of interest, the foundational way historians 'know' things about the past' has been
  unchallenged. Despite the use of statistics, the new themes (society, women, gender,
  culture) and the application of fresh concepts and theories, there remain two steady
  points in the historian's cosmos: empiricism and rational analysis. As the product
  of the European eighteenth-century Enlightenment the empirical-analytical model
  has become the epistemology for undertaking the study of the past.\r\nHowever, since
  the 1960s and 1970s something has changed at this epistemological level. Doubts
  about the empirical-analytical as the privileged path to historical knowing have
  emerged. This has not happened in history alone, of course. In all the arts, humanities,
  social sciences, and even the physical and life sciences the question is increasingly
  being put, how can we be sure that empiricism and inference really does get us close
  to the true meaning of the past? In history how can we trust our sources - not because
  they are forgeries or missing, but because of the claims empiricism is forced to
  make about our ability not only to find the data, but also just as importantly represent
  their meaning accurately? It is not an abstract or scholastic philosophical question
  to ask, where does meaning come from in history? Is it the past itself? Is its meaning
  simply ushered in by the historian. Is the historian merely the midwife to the truth
  of the past? Or is the historian unavoidably implicated in the creation of a meaning
  for the past. Does the past contain one true meaning or several? Is there one story
  to be discovered or several that can be legitimately generated? I think most historians
  today would agree on the latter analysis. The difference comes over the consequences
  of that implication, and what it does for truth. In other words is it the historian
  who provides the truth of the past as she represents it rather than as she finds
  it? This is the essence of the postmodern challenge, the turn to the narrative-linguistic
  and its implications.\r\nWhat makes this turn more significant than the others is
  that it demonstrates a deeper change in our views concerning the conditions under
  which we create historical knowledge. In other words it has challenged history not
  with new topics or methods as such, but by confronting the discipline's empirical-analytical
  foundations. The linguistic turn in history, of course, continues to rely on the
  empirical-analytical model, but it extends the our epistemology to include its narrative-linguistic
  representation, the form we give to the past within our texts, and it accepts history
  as an essentially literary activity, one that is self-evidently authored. The emphasis
  now is less on history as a process of objective discovery and report but, rather,
  accepts its unavoidably fictive nature, that is, its literary constructedness. By
  this I mean recognising the figurative assumptions that underpin authorial activity
  in creating the text and which are already (in a pre-empirical sense) and necessarily
  brought to the historical field, often determining the selection of evidence and
  its most likely meaning. This is a process that is revealed by the complex analysis
  of authorial activity.\r\nPostmodern history, because it is a literary as much as
  an empirical project, recognises it cannot escape its authorship. In other words,
  the past is not just re-interpreted according to new evidence but also through self-conscious
  acts of re-writing as well. Thus it is that history and the past cannot coincide
  to the extent that the former, whether we like it or not, is principally a narrative
  about the latter. Arguably there are no original centres of meaning to be found
  outside the narrative-linguistic. Data in and of itself does not have given meaning.
  Though empirical and analytical, postmodern history deliberately draws our attention
  to the conditions under which we create knowledge, in the case of history its nature
  as a series of forms, or turns perhaps, of a realist literature? In a very real
  sense the postmodern challenge forces us to face up to the highly complex question
  of how we know things about the past and what we, as moral beings, do as a result.\r\nIn
  other words, it extends the remit of history to include the historian's pre-narrative
  assumptions and how we translate those assumptions figuratively as we construct
  our strategies of narrative explanation. Postmodern historians thus ask many fresh
  questions. Are facts best thought of as events under a description? Is all data
  ultimately textual and, if so, what are its implications? Should history be written
  primarily according to literary rules and, if so, what are they? What is the significant
  difference between literary and figurative speech in history and how does it create
  historical meaning? How do we distinguish the historical referent of a discourse
  and its constructed, i.e., its ideological, meaning? Can history ever exist beyond
  discourse? And the very big question, is history what happened, or what historians
  tell us happened? All these have to be addressed when we do history, to ignore them
  is to do only half the job. \r\nOctober 2001 \r\n\r\nBack to articles index\r\n\r\n
