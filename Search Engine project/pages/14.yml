  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
- |
  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- Higher education finance may sound like the kind of subject that’s best left to the experts. But university faculty members need to understand the topic if they want to play an effective role in how their institutions are governed, says IU faculty member Don Hossler.
- |
  Hossler, professor emeritus of educational leadership and policy studies in the Indiana University School of Education, will elaborate on the topic next week in his IU Sonneborn Lecture, "Why Does College Cost So Much? Some Notes on Institutional Agency.”
- |
  The annual lecture will take place from 4 to 6 p.m. Tuesday, Dec. 8, in Whittenberger Auditorium in the Indiana Memorial Union. It is free and open to the public.
- |
  A reception in the IMU University Club President’s Room will follow to honor Hossler, recipient of the 2015 Tracy M. Sonneborn Award, and newly appointed Provost Professors Randall Beer in the Cognitive Science Program, Kari Ellen Gade in the Department of Germanic Studies and Stephanie A. Sanders in the Department of Gender Studies.
- |
  "Professor Hossler’s research epitomizes the type of scholarship that has tangible effects on educational practice and that illuminates complex issues for the public," said Terry Mason, interim dean of the IU School of Education. "I am very pleased that his fine work is receiving the recognition it deserves."
- |
  Hossler, who served as IU vice chancellor for enrollment services from 1997 to 2005, will draw on his own experience and scholarship as well as the research of others to examine how college costs are tied to changes in the higher education workforce and responsibilities for research, teaching and service.
- |
  “If you are a faculty member and you want to have a role in deciding the relative merit of various ways the institution spends money, you’ve got to understand these things,” he said.
- |
  State support for higher education is unlikely to increase in the foreseeable future, he said, and that suggests universities should focus on spending decisions that reflect institutional priorities. Using national data, he will discuss how higher education staffing and expenditures are changing.
- |
  For example, there is strong evidence that the number of administrative and professional employees at public research universities has grown substantially while the number of faculty has not. But the reasons are complex; Hossler cites a number of reasons, including changes in research, IT staff and student services.
- |
  Tenure-track faculty have faced greater expectations for research, resulting in the hiring of more contingent faculty to teach classes and more professional staff for student advising and other services. Research also is expensive, with more stringent regulatory requirements requiring the hiring of additional staff.
- |
  Many universities, meanwhile, are spending more on student recruiting, admissions, orientation and financial aid to attract and retain the most desirable students. While undergraduate tuition helps subsidize other functions, decisions have to be made about which students to enroll and why.
- |
  “There are value judgments that have to be made about how universities spend their money,” Hossler said, “because the external funding environment is not likely to change.”
- |
  A widely known authority on higher education policy, Hossler served as director of the Center for Postsecondary Research at IU Bloomington and was executive director of the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. He is currently a senior scholar at the Center for Enrollment Research, Policy and Practice in the University of Southern California Rossier School of Education.
- "The Sonneborn award and lecture are named for the late IU biologist Tracy M. Sonneborn,
  a renowned geneticist who was also highly regarded for his teaching. Current and
  past winners of the Sonneborn Award and faculty who have been named Provost Professors
  can be seen at the Office of the Vice Provost for Faculty and Academic Affairs website.Related

  Lecture to address factors in college costs, spending2015 Sonneborn Lecture to address
  factors in college costs, spendingDec. 2, 2015Editor’s note: Due to unforeseen circumstances,
  Don Hossler will be unable to deliver the Dec. 8, 2015, Sonneborn Lecture. He asked
  that his prepared remarks be delivered by Barry Bull, professor emeritus in the
  IU School of Education.\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nBLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- Higher education
  finance may sound like the kind of subject that’s best left to the experts. But
  university faculty members need to understand the topic if they want to play an
  effective role in how their institutions are governed, says IU faculty member Don
  Hossler.\nHossler, professor emeritus of educational leadership and policy studies
  in the Indiana University School of Education, will elaborate on the topic next
  week in his IU Sonneborn Lecture, \"Why Does College Cost So Much? Some Notes on
  Institutional Agency.”\nThe annual lecture will take place from 4 to 6 p.m. Tuesday,
  Dec. 8, in Whittenberger Auditorium in the Indiana Memorial Union. It is free and
  open to the public.\nA reception in the IMU University Club President’s Room will
  follow to honor Hossler, recipient of the 2015 Tracy M. Sonneborn Award, and newly
  appointed Provost Professors Randall Beer in the Cognitive Science Program, Kari
  Ellen Gade in the Department of Germanic Studies and Stephanie A. Sanders in the
  Department of Gender Studies.\n\"Professor Hossler’s research epitomizes the type
  of scholarship that has tangible effects on educational practice and that illuminates
  complex issues for the public,\" said Terry Mason, interim dean of the IU School
  of Education. \"I am very pleased that his fine work is receiving the recognition
  it deserves.\"\nHossler, who served as IU vice chancellor for enrollment services
  from 1997 to 2005, will draw on his own experience and scholarship as well as the
  research of others to examine how college costs are tied to changes in the higher
  education workforce and responsibilities for research, teaching and service.\n“If
  you are a faculty member and you want to have a role in deciding the relative merit
  of various ways the institution spends money, you’ve got to understand these things,”
  he said.\nState support for higher education is unlikely to increase in the foreseeable
  future, he said, and that suggests universities should focus on spending decisions
  that reflect institutional priorities. Using national data, he will discuss how
  higher education staffing and expenditures are changing.\nFor example, there is
  strong evidence that the number of administrative and professional employees at
  public research universities has grown substantially while the number of faculty
  has not. But the reasons are complex; Hossler cites a number of reasons, including
  changes in research, IT staff and student services.\nTenure-track faculty have faced
  greater expectations for research, resulting in the hiring of more contingent faculty
  to teach classes and more professional staff for student advising and other services.
  Research also is expensive, with more stringent regulatory requirements requiring
  the hiring of additional staff.\nMany universities, meanwhile, are spending more
  on student recruiting, admissions, orientation and financial aid to attract and
  retain the most desirable students. While undergraduate tuition helps subsidize
  other functions, decisions have to be made about which students to enroll and why.\n“There
  are value judgments that have to be made about how universities spend their money,”
  Hossler said, “because the external funding environment is not likely to change.”\nA
  widely known authority on higher education policy, Hossler served as director of
  the Center for Postsecondary Research at IU Bloomington and was executive director
  of the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. He is currently a senior
  scholar at the Center for Enrollment Research, Policy and Practice in the University
  of Southern California Rossier School of Education.\nThe Sonneborn award and lecture
  are named for the late IU biologist Tracy M. Sonneborn, a renowned geneticist who
  was also highly regarded for his teaching. Current and past winners of the Sonneborn
  Award and faculty who have been named Provost Professors can be seen at the Office
  of the Vice Provost for Faculty and Academic Affairs website.Related LinksOffice
