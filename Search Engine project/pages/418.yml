  Enter Your DetailsYour DetailsHow much house can you afford?Fill out your details to see how much house you can afford.Annual Household Income Your City Monthly SpendingDebtMonthly debt payments ExpensesMonthly expenses SavingsMonthly savings Total$658See Your Suggested House PriceHow much house can I afford?Determine how much house you can afford using our mortgage calculator.Want to learn more first?Affordability 101What factors help determine what I can afford?Understanding how much house you can afford is the first step in becoming a homeowner. Here are some key factors that affect affordability:Income – Money that you receive on a regular basis, for work or through investments, helps establish a baseline for what you can afford to pay every month.Funds available – This is the amount of cash you have available to put down and to cover closing costs. It can be from savings, investments or other forms of liquid assets.Expenses – It's important to take into consideration other monthly obligations you may have, such as credit cards, car payments, student loans, etc.Credit profile – Your credit score influences the rating a lending bank can provide. The higher your credit score, the more money you'll likely be able to borrow at a lower interest rate.PRO TIP:Your monthly debt expenses with a mortgage payment should not be more than 36% of your gross monthly income.If I can afford the home, should I buy it?We'll provide you with an appropriate price range based on your situation. Most importantly, we'll take into account all your monthly obligations to determine if a home is comfortably within reach.PRO TIP:It’s also important to plan for the future. Consider creating a savings plan for upcoming life events, such as having a child.Where can I find more information about affordability?For more information about home affordability, be sure to check out NerdWallet's guide to buying a home..What if I am pre-qualified by a bank for a higher amount than my affordability results tell me?When banks evaluate your affordability, they only take into account your outstanding debts. They do not take into consideration if you want to set aside $250 every month for your retirement or if you're expecting a baby and want to set aside additional funds. NerdWallet's Affordability Tool will help give you an accurate assessment considering some of these really important factors.Get started by entering your income.Enter your Details

  101What factors help determine what I can afford?Understanding how much house you
  can afford is the first step in becoming a homeowner. Here are some key factors
  that affect affordability:Income – Money that you receive on a regular basis, for
  work or through investments, helps establish a baseline for what you can afford
  to pay every month.Funds available – This is the amount of cash you have available
  to put down and to cover closing costs. It can be from savings, investments or other
  forms of liquid assets.Expenses – It's important to take into consideration other
  monthly obligations you may have, such as credit cards, car payments, student loans,
  etc.Credit profile – Your credit score influences the rating a lending bank can
  provide. The higher your credit score, the more money you'll likely be able to borrow
  at a lower interest rate.PRO TIP:Your monthly debt expenses with a mortgage payment
  should not be more than 36% of your gross monthly income.If I can afford the home,
  should I buy it?We'll provide you with an appropriate price range based on your
  situation. Most importantly, we'll take into account all your monthly obligations
  to determine if a home is comfortably within reach.PRO TIP:It’s also important to
  plan for the future. Consider creating a savings plan for upcoming life events,
  such as having a child.Where can I find more information about affordability?For
  more information about home affordability, be sure to check out NerdWallet's guide
  to buying a home..What if I am pre-qualified by a bank for a higher amount than
  my affordability results tell me?When banks evaluate your affordability, they only
  take into account your outstanding debts. They do not take into consideration if
  you want to set aside $250 every month for your retirement or if you're expecting
  a baby and want to set aside additional funds. NerdWallet's Affordability Tool will
  help give you an accurate assessment considering some of these really important
  factors.Get started by entering your income.Enter your Details\n\n\n                \n
