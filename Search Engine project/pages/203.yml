  Number of articles and pages
- |
  The first graph shows the number of articles (technically speaking, all pages from mainspace, without redirects and subpages), including articles that are not "live."[2]
- |2
    Fig. 1. Number of articles
- |
  The second graph shows number of all pages from all namespaces (e.g. userpages, talk pages and images are included, redirects are not). This is the green line. The blue line is the one from the first graph (i.e. the mainspace pages). What made the greeen line jump almost vertically mid February  2007? It was Saint Valentine's, when after slashdotting many new users registered and were welcomed on their talk pages. Notice that at the same time there was no parallel growth in the mainspace. Apparently, the newly registered users were mainly watching, since at that time there was no unregistered access. A more stable growth rate has been established after the launch.

  Rate of article and page creation
- |
  The third and fourth figure present global creation rate. It measures the activity on the wiki expressed in new pages per day.  The rate for "pure" articles  (technically: mainspace without redirects) is depicted in blue; the green line corresponds to all pages (still, without redirects). This is calculated as the number of articles (pages, respectively) divided by the number of working days from the beginning. Obviously, this is a "global average", to be compared with a recent creation rate on the 5th graph of this section. It represents the creation rate for articles taking into account last 30 days only.
- |2+

    Fig. 4. Overall creation rate in pages per day (green line); the blue line corresponds to articles' creation rate
- "Figure 5 indicates recent creation rate.  But it needs special explanation.  In
  the earliest months of the project, the Citizendium was a \"fork\" of Wikipedia,
  i.e., we had uploaded all Wikipedia articles. Then, in mid-January 2007, the project's
  participants decided to \"unfork,\" that is to delete all articles that were not
  tagged \"live\" i.e.  improved or meant to be improved soon here on CZ. If an article
  appears to be created before that moment it means that it survived the \"Big Unfork\"
  procedure and the 'creation' date is in fact that of its first revision on CZ. \n"
- |
  In other words, the growing rate before mid-January is not very meaningful as the rules then were different and putting a tag or just correcting a typo 'created' an article. In the mid-January the article creation statistic plummeted to four articles per day--which was probably a better indicator of the rate at which we were creating our own new content.
- "There was a spike in February 2007 because of a self-registration period and then
  again in April-May 2007 because of our public launch and the accompanying publicity.
  \ There was a spike in November 2007 for three reasons: a press release, a \"Stub
  Week\" initiative, and (especially) a very broadly-distributed call for participation
  made to persons with unused Citizendium accounts.  December 2007 experienced a relative
  lull no doubt largely on account of the holidays. \n"

  Edits daily
- |
  The number of edits is highly variable from one day to another. More meaningful is the 30 days moving average[3] depicted below. Trends are easily visible. The price for readability is a little shift from the actual events: the changes on graph appear a few days after it happened. For example the impact of the launch that occurred in March 2007 can be observed here a bit later.

  The graph takes into account edits in all namespaces.

  Human resources
- |
  Number of authors
- |
  The following graphs describe the CZ human resources.  These graphs need clarification, because in the months leading up to February 2006, all new authors had to create their own bios, and many new people did that and then nothing else.  The Jan.-Feb. 2006 spike is due to a two-week period in which we allowed self-registration.  There was also a spike that lasted from the end of March through May 2006, which corresponded to our public launch and the PR blitz that followed.  The numbers from June 2006 on are perhaps a better indicator of long-term personnel trends on the wiki.

   How many authors are active each  month? The Fig. 6 presents the number of users that made at least one  edit (separately for each month).

   How many users get more involved? Fig. 7. shows how many authors make at least 20 (at least 100, resp.) edits per month.

  Daily contributors
- "How many contributors could you meet here daily, on average? While correlated with
  other human resources measures, this one seems to be interesting since it shows
  how many people make the community on a daily basis. See the figure below. \n"

    Fig. 8. Authors daily

  New arrivals
- "Fig. 9: How many new authors arrive each month? This can be measured by counting
  new user pages. More substantial metric would be, however, to detect a new user
  on his first edit. Notice that in the period of self-registration (essentially,
  one week in January and two weeks in February 2007) the two metric largely coincide,
  as the new users were supposed to provide their bio.  There was also a spike in
  March, which continued into April, due to our launch.  New arrivals have been almost
  exclusively the result of press coverage, of which there has been relatively little
  over the summer, since our public launch.  There were also fewer arrivals in the
  summer, probably due to the lower amount of academic activity generally.  \n"

  Word count
- |
  The table below is based on database dumps made about the end of every month. The following example explains its content.
- "As of end of July, 2007, Citizendium contained about 4100K words in its articles.
  \n"
- "We do not count the tables, nor \"infoboxes\". Technical information, as e.g. categories
  or http links are not counted. Draft pages are excluded. \n"
- "A typical article was about 562 words long.  In fact, this is the median size,
  which means that, at the time, half of our articles were longer. There were about
  3170 clusters. \n"
- |
  A cluster means here the main article with a set of subpages describing given subject (this is the basic unit of Citizendium). The difference between the numbers shown here and the 16,891 total articles displayed on the Welcome Page is that the latter count includes neither external articles nor articles without metadata (which are typically lemma articles, i.e. containing just a short definition or description of the subject). Note also that for computing the median size only the main (or base) page of each cluster (without any subpages) is taken into account.

  Notes
- |
  ↑ The graphs have been produced using the publicly available data from the history of edits of all Citizendium pages. Concerning the comparison with the Wikipedia, the "stub-meta-history" dump files were used (see the appropriate subpages from this index).
- |2+

- |
  ↑ Here we do not count the subpages, but the clusters. We are working on a presentation taking the subpages into account.
- |2+

- |
  ↑ That is the average calculated for every day, taking into account the 29 preceding days.
- |2+

- |
  ↑ The high increase in clusters was no doubt due to this blog post.
- |2+

- |
  ↑ For technical reasons, numbers for July are determined as the mean between June and August

  }Since its inception (Nov. 2006) and official launch (March 28, 2007), Citizendium has grown. This page provides statistics on Citizendium's output of articles and its contributor base.[1] Our meta-discussions take place on the forum, the relevant statistics page is here.
- |
  The first graph shows the number of articles (technically speaking, all pages from mainspace, without redirects and subpages), including articles that are not "live."[2]The second graph shows number of all pages from all namespaces (e.g. userpages, talk pages and images are included, redirects are not). This is the green line. The blue line is the one from the first graph (i.e. the mainspace pages). What made the greeen line jump almost vertically mid February  2007? It was Saint Valentine's, when after slashdotting many new users registered and were welcomed on their talk pages. Notice that at the same time there was no parallel growth in the mainspace. Apparently, the newly registered users were mainly watching, since at that time there was no unregistered access. A more stable growth rate has been established after the launch.
- |
  The third and fourth figure present global creation rate. It measures the activity on the wiki expressed in new pages per day.  The rate for "pure" articles  (technically: mainspace without redirects) is depicted in blue; the green line corresponds to all pages (still, without redirects). This is calculated as the number of articles (pages, respectively) divided by the number of working days from the beginning. Obviously, this is a "global average", to be compared with a recent creation rate on the 5th graph of this section. It represents the creation rate for articles taking into account last 30 days only.
- "Figure 5 indicates recent creation rate.  But it needs special explanation.  In
  the earliest months of the project, the Citizendium was a \"fork\" of Wikipedia,
  i.e., we had uploaded all Wikipedia articles. Then, in mid-January 2007, the project's
  participants decided to \"unfork,\" that is to delete all articles that were not
  tagged \"live\" i.e.  improved or meant to be improved soon here on CZ. If an article
  appears to be created before that moment it means that it survived the \"Big Unfork\"
  procedure and the 'creation' date is in fact that of its first revision on CZ. \n"
- |
  In other words, the growing rate before mid-January is not very meaningful as the rules then were different and putting a tag or just correcting a typo 'created' an article. In the mid-January the article creation statistic plummeted to four articles per day--which was probably a better indicator of the rate at which we were creating our own new content.
- "There was a spike in February 2007 because of a self-registration period and then
  again in April-May 2007 because of our public launch and the accompanying publicity.
  \ There was a spike in November 2007 for three reasons: a press release, a \"Stub
  Week\" initiative, and (especially) a very broadly-distributed call for participation
  made to persons with unused Citizendium accounts.  December 2007 experienced a relative
  lull no doubt largely on account of the holidays. \n"
- |
  The number of edits is highly variable from one day to another. More meaningful is the 30 days moving average[3] depicted below. Trends are easily visible. The price for readability is a little shift from the actual events: the changes on graph appear a few days after it happened. For example the impact of the launch that occurred in March 2007 can be observed here a bit later.
- |
  The graph takes into account edits in all namespaces.
- |
  The following graphs describe the CZ human resources.  These graphs need clarification, because in the months leading up to February 2006, all new authors had to create their own bios, and many new people did that and then nothing else.  The Jan.-Feb. 2006 spike is due to a two-week period in which we allowed self-registration.  There was also a spike that lasted from the end of March through May 2006, which corresponded to our public launch and the PR blitz that followed.  The numbers from June 2006 on are perhaps a better indicator of long-term personnel trends on the wiki.
- "How many contributors could you meet here daily, on average? While correlated with
  other human resources measures, this one seems to be interesting since it shows
  how many people make the community on a daily basis. See the figure below. \n"
- "Fig. 9: How many new authors arrive each month? This can be measured by counting
  new user pages. More substantial metric would be, however, to detect a new user
  on his first edit. Notice that in the period of self-registration (essentially,
  one week in January and two weeks in February 2007) the two metric largely coincide,
  as the new users were supposed to provide their bio.  There was also a spike in
  March, which continued into April, due to our launch.  New arrivals have been almost
  exclusively the result of press coverage, of which there has been relatively little
  over the summer, since our public launch.  There were also fewer arrivals in the
  summer, probably due to the lower amount of academic activity generally.  \n"
- |
  The table below is based on database dumps made about the end of every month. The following example explains its content.
- "As of end of July, 2007, Citizendium contained about 4100K words in its articles.
  \n"
- "We do not count the tables, nor \"infoboxes\". Technical information, as e.g. categories
  or http links are not counted. Draft pages are excluded. \n"
- "A typical article was about 562 words long.  In fact, this is the median size,
  which means that, at the time, half of our articles were longer. There were about
  3170 clusters. \n"
- |
  A cluster means here the main article with a set of subpages describing given subject (this is the basic unit of Citizendium). The difference between the numbers shown here and the 16,891 total articles displayed on the Welcome Page is that the latter count includes neither external articles nor articles without metadata (which are typically lemma articles, i.e. containing just a short definition or description of the subject). Note also that for computing the median size only the main (or base) page of each cluster (without any subpages) is taken into account.

  (Nov. 2006) and official launch (March 28, 2007), Citizendium has grown. This page
  provides statistics on Citizendium's output of articles and its contributor base.[1]
  Our meta-discussions take place on the forum, the relevant statistics page is here.\n\nContents\n1

  graph shows the number of articles (technically speaking, all pages from mainspace,
  without redirects and subpages), including articles that are not \"live.\"[2]\n
  \ Fig. 1. Number of articles\nThe second graph shows number of all pages from all
  namespaces (e.g. userpages, talk pages and images are included, redirects are not).
  This is the green line. The blue line is the one from the first graph (i.e. the
  mainspace pages). What made the greeen line jump almost vertically mid February
  \ 2007? It was Saint Valentine's, when after slashdotting many new users registered
  and were welcomed on their talk pages. Notice that at the same time there was no
  parallel growth in the mainspace. Apparently, the newly registered users were mainly
  watching, since at that time there was no unregistered access. A more stable growth
  rate has been established after the launch.\n\n  Fig. 2. Number of all pages from
  all namespaces (green) and articles (blue).\nRate of article and page creation\nThe
  third and fourth figure present global creation rate. It measures the activity on
  the wiki expressed in new pages per day.  The rate for \"pure\" articles  (technically:
  mainspace without redirects) is depicted in blue; the green line corresponds to
  all pages (still, without redirects). This is calculated as the number of articles
  (pages, respectively) divided by the number of working days from the beginning.
  Obviously, this is a \"global average\", to be compared with a recent creation rate
  on the 5th graph of this section. It represents the creation rate for articles taking
  into account last 30 days only.\n\n  Fig. 3. Creation rate (articles per day)\n
  \ Fig. 4. Overall creation rate in pages per day (green line); the blue line corresponds
  to articles' creation rate\nFigure 5 indicates recent creation rate.  But it needs
  special explanation.  In the earliest months of the project, the Citizendium was
  a \"fork\" of Wikipedia, i.e., we had uploaded all Wikipedia articles. Then, in
  mid-January 2007, the project's participants decided to \"unfork,\" that is to delete
  all articles that were not tagged \"live\" i.e.  improved or meant to be improved
  soon here on CZ. If an article appears to be created before that moment it means
  that it survived the \"Big Unfork\" procedure and the 'creation' date is in fact
  that of its first revision on CZ. \nIn other words, the growing rate before mid-January
  is not very meaningful as the rules then were different and putting a tag or just
  correcting a typo 'created' an article. In the mid-January the article creation
  statistic plummeted to four articles per day--which was probably a better indicator
  of the rate at which we were creating our own new content.\nThere was a spike in
  February 2007 because of a self-registration period and then again in April-May
  2007 because of our public launch and the accompanying publicity.  There was a spike
  in November 2007 for three reasons: a press release, a \"Stub Week\" initiative,
  and (especially) a very broadly-distributed call for participation made to persons
  with unused Citizendium accounts.  December 2007 experienced a relative lull no
  doubt largely on account of the holidays. \n\n  Fig. 5. Recent creation rate (last
  30 days counted)\nEdits daily\nThe number of edits is highly variable from one day
  to another. More meaningful is the 30 days moving average[3] depicted below. Trends
  are easily visible. The price for readability is a little shift from the actual
  events: the changes on graph appear a few days after it happened. For example the
  impact of the launch that occurred in March 2007 can be observed here a bit later.\nThe
  graph takes into account edits in all namespaces.\n\n  Fig. 5a. Edits by day, 30
  days moving average.\nHuman resources\nNumber of authors\nThe following graphs describe
  the CZ human resources.  These graphs need clarification, because in the months
  leading up to February 2006, all new authors had to create their own bios, and many
  new people did that and then nothing else.  The Jan.-Feb. 2006 spike is due to a
  two-week period in which we allowed self-registration.  There was also a spike that
  lasted from the end of March through May 2006, which corresponded to our public
  launch and the PR blitz that followed.  The numbers from June 2006 on are perhaps
  a better indicator of long-term personnel trends on the wiki.\n\n How many authors
  are active each  month? The Fig. 6 presents the number of users that made at least
  one  edit (separately for each month).\n  Fig. 6. Editing authors\n How many users
  get more involved? Fig. 7. shows how many authors make at least 20 (at least 100,
  resp.) edits per month.\n  Fig. 7. Active authors\nDaily contributors\nHow many
  contributors could you meet here daily, on average? While correlated with other
  human resources measures, this one seems to be interesting since it shows how many
  people make the community on a daily basis. See the figure below. \n\n  Fig. 8.
  Authors daily\nNew arrivals\nFig. 9: How many new authors arrive each month? This
  can be measured by counting new user pages. More substantial metric would be, however,
  to detect a new user on his first edit. Notice that in the period of self-registration
  (essentially, one week in January and two weeks in February 2007) the two metric
  largely coincide, as the new users were supposed to provide their bio.  There was
  also a spike in March, which continued into April, due to our launch.  New arrivals
  have been almost exclusively the result of press coverage, of which there has been
  relatively little over the summer, since our public launch.  There were also fewer
  arrivals in the summer, probably due to the lower amount of academic activity generally.
  \ \n\n  Fig. 9. New arrivals\n\nWord count\nThe table below is based on database
  dumps made about the end of every month. The following example explains its content.\nAs
  of end of July, 2007, Citizendium contained about 4100K words in its articles. \nWe
  do not count the tables, nor \"infoboxes\". Technical information, as e.g. categories
  or http links are not counted. Draft pages are excluded. \nA typical article was
  about 562 words long.  In fact, this is the median size, which means that, at the
  time, half of our articles were longer. There were about 3170 clusters. \nA cluster
  means here the main article with a set of subpages describing given subject (this
  is the basic unit of Citizendium). The difference between the numbers shown here
  and the 16,891 total articles displayed on the Welcome Page is that the latter count
  includes neither external articles nor articles without metadata (which are typically
  lemma articles, i.e. containing just a short definition or description of the subject).
  Note also that for computing the median size only the main (or base) page of each
  cluster (without any subpages) is taken into account.\n\n Date \n Total Words \n

  its inception (Nov. 2006) and official launch (March 28, 2007), Citizendium has
  grown. This page provides statistics on Citizendium's output of articles and its
  contributor base.[1] Our meta-discussions take place on the forum, the relevant
  statistics page is here.\nThe first graph shows the number of articles (technically
  speaking, all pages from mainspace, without redirects and subpages), including articles
  that are not \"live.\"[2]The second graph shows number of all pages from all namespaces
  (e.g. userpages, talk pages and images are included, redirects are not). This is
  the green line. The blue line is the one from the first graph (i.e. the mainspace
  pages). What made the greeen line jump almost vertically mid February  2007? It
  was Saint Valentine's, when after slashdotting many new users registered and were
  welcomed on their talk pages. Notice that at the same time there was no parallel
  growth in the mainspace. Apparently, the newly registered users were mainly watching,
  since at that time there was no unregistered access. A more stable growth rate has
  been established after the launch.\nThe third and fourth figure present global creation
  rate. It measures the activity on the wiki expressed in new pages per day.  The
  rate for \"pure\" articles  (technically: mainspace without redirects) is depicted
  in blue; the green line corresponds to all pages (still, without redirects). This
  is calculated as the number of articles (pages, respectively) divided by the number
  of working days from the beginning. Obviously, this is a \"global average\", to
  be compared with a recent creation rate on the 5th graph of this section. It represents
  the creation rate for articles taking into account last 30 days only.\nFigure 5
  indicates recent creation rate.  But it needs special explanation.  In the earliest
  months of the project, the Citizendium was a \"fork\" of Wikipedia, i.e., we had
  uploaded all Wikipedia articles. Then, in mid-January 2007, the project's participants
  decided to \"unfork,\" that is to delete all articles that were not tagged \"live\"
  i.e.  improved or meant to be improved soon here on CZ. If an article appears to
  be created before that moment it means that it survived the \"Big Unfork\" procedure
  and the 'creation' date is in fact that of its first revision on CZ. \nIn other
  words, the growing rate before mid-January is not very meaningful as the rules then
  were different and putting a tag or just correcting a typo 'created' an article.
  In the mid-January the article creation statistic plummeted to four articles per
  day--which was probably a better indicator of the rate at which we were creating
  our own new content.\nThere was a spike in February 2007 because of a self-registration
  period and then again in April-May 2007 because of our public launch and the accompanying
  publicity.  There was a spike in November 2007 for three reasons: a press release,
  a \"Stub Week\" initiative, and (especially) a very broadly-distributed call for
  participation made to persons with unused Citizendium accounts.  December 2007 experienced
  a relative lull no doubt largely on account of the holidays. \nThe number of edits
  is highly variable from one day to another. More meaningful is the 30 days moving
  average[3] depicted below. Trends are easily visible. The price for readability
  is a little shift from the actual events: the changes on graph appear a few days
  after it happened. For example the impact of the launch that occurred in March 2007
  can be observed here a bit later.\nThe graph takes into account edits in all namespaces.\nThe
  following graphs describe the CZ human resources.  These graphs need clarification,
  because in the months leading up to February 2006, all new authors had to create
  their own bios, and many new people did that and then nothing else.  The Jan.-Feb.
  2006 spike is due to a two-week period in which we allowed self-registration.  There
  was also a spike that lasted from the end of March through May 2006, which corresponded
  to our public launch and the PR blitz that followed.  The numbers from June 2006
  on are perhaps a better indicator of long-term personnel trends on the wiki.\nHow
  many contributors could you meet here daily, on average? While correlated with other
  human resources measures, this one seems to be interesting since it shows how many
  people make the community on a daily basis. See the figure below. \nFig. 9: How
  many new authors arrive each month? This can be measured by counting new user pages.
  More substantial metric would be, however, to detect a new user on his first edit.
  Notice that in the period of self-registration (essentially, one week in January
  and two weeks in February 2007) the two metric largely coincide, as the new users
  were supposed to provide their bio.  There was also a spike in March, which continued
  into April, due to our launch.  New arrivals have been almost exclusively the result
  of press coverage, of which there has been relatively little over the summer, since
  our public launch.  There were also fewer arrivals in the summer, probably due to
  the lower amount of academic activity generally.  \nThe table below is based on
  database dumps made about the end of every month. The following example explains
  its content.\nAs of end of July, 2007, Citizendium contained about 4100K words in
  its articles. \nWe do not count the tables, nor \"infoboxes\". Technical information,
  as e.g. categories or http links are not counted. Draft pages are excluded. \nA
  typical article was about 562 words long.  In fact, this is the median size, which
  means that, at the time, half of our articles were longer. There were about 3170
  clusters. \nA cluster means here the main article with a set of subpages describing
  given subject (this is the basic unit of Citizendium). The difference between the
  numbers shown here and the 16,891 total articles displayed on the Welcome Page is
  that the latter count includes neither external articles nor articles without metadata
  (which are typically lemma articles, i.e. containing just a short definition or
  description of the subject). Note also that for computing the median size only the
  main (or base) page of each cluster (without any subpages) is taken into account.\nRecall
  that we categorize the articles as follows \n\nAnd this is, approximately, how it
  evolved in time.  \n\n...and how it came to this\nHere we graph the  number of articles
  in various workgroups vs. time. \nSee CZ:AddThis_Tracking_Statistics.\n"
