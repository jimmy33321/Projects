                  Donald Trump released a glowing letter from his physician Monday declaring that the Republican presidential candidate will be "the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency" if he wins in 2016.

                  The letter from Dr. Jacob Bornstein of Lenox Hill Hospital, identified as Trump's personal physician since 1980, was released after Trump promised to disclose his medical records amid questions about the billionaire businessman's health.

                  Trump, 69, has acknowledged eating a less-than-healthy diet -- heavy on McDonalds -- and said his primary form of exercise consists of speaking at campaign events.

                  "I love steak and hamburger and pasta and French fries -- all the things we shouldn't be eating," he said during an interview this fall on Bloomberg's "With All Due Respect."

                  Nonetheless, his medical evaluation -- a glowing, four-paragraph assessment, written in similar language to that used by Trump himself -- said the GOP front-runner has suffered no significant medical problems over the past 39 years.

                  Trump takes aspirin and a low dose of statins daily, but has suffered no form of cancer or joint replacement.

                  Trump, who does not smoke or drink alcohol, often likes to boast of his stamina on the campaign trail, despite logging far fewer events than many other candidates.

                  Trump had promised to release his medical records following questions from the news outlet Politico earlier this month.   In an interview with Barbara Walters, Trump's oldest children were asked what she would change about their father.

                  In a New York Times Magazine profile, Trump was quoted saying that he's not following any particular exercise regime. `'All my friends who work out all the time, they're going for knee replacements, hip replacements -- they're a disaster," he said.   Instead, the magazine wrote, "he exerts himself fully by standing in front of an audience for an hour."   
- "                \n"

                  Still, Trump's physician said he's lost at least 15 pounds over the last 12 months.   Releasing health records has become a standard campaign practice, and several of Trump's rivals, including Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, and GOP rival Jeb Bush have already released statements of health from their doctors far more detailed than the one released by Trump.

                  Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said the doctor's letter is the only record of his health the campaign intends to release.   A two-page letter by Clinton's physician included references to her hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies, as well as a 2009 elbow fracture and 2012 concussion that continues to stokes concerns about her health.

                  Bush's physician outlined a medical history that included a past vitamin D insufficiency, gastritis, colon polyps, sinusitis, and low back pain. The letter also spelled out his body mass index, cholesterol and pulse, in addition his blood pressure and daily medications.

                  Sen. John McCain, for instance, faced concerns about his age as well as a medical history when he ran for president that included several bouts with melanoma. His 2008 campaign released eight years of McCain's medical records as it sought to prove that McCain, then-71, was healthy enough for the presidency.

- "\t                        Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump flashes
  thumbs up after being endorsed at a regional police union meeting in Portsmouth,
  N.H., Thursday, Dec. 10, 2015. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n"
- "\t                        \n"
- "\t                Donald Trump released a glowing letter from his physician Monday
  declaring that the Republican presidential candidate will be \"the healthiest individual
  ever elected to the presidency\" if he wins in 2016.   The letter from Dr. Jacob
  Bornstein of Lenox Hill Hospital, identified as Trump's personal physician since
  1980, was released after Trump promised to disclose his medical records amid questions
  about the billionaire businessman's health.   Trump, 69, has acknowledged eating
  a less-than-healthy diet -- heavy on McDonalds -- and said his primary form of exercise
  consists of speaking at campaign events.   \"I love steak and hamburger and pasta
  and French fries -- all the things we shouldn't be eating,\" he said during an interview
  this fall on Bloomberg's \"With All Due Respect.\"   Nonetheless, his medical evaluation
  -- a glowing, four-paragraph assessment, written in similar language to that used
  by Trump himself -- said the GOP front-runner has suffered no significant medical
  problems over the past 39 years.   A recent exam, Bornstein wrote, \"showed only
  positive results,\" with a blood pressure rating of 110/65 and laboratory test results
  he described as \"astonishingly excellent.\"   Trump takes aspirin and a low dose
  of statins daily, but has suffered no form of cancer or joint replacement.   \"His
  physical strength and stamina are extraordinary,\" Bornstein added, saying Trump's
  only surgery was an appendectomy at the age of 10.   Trump, who does not smoke or
  drink alcohol, often likes to boast of his stamina on the campaign trail, despite
  logging far fewer events than many other candidates.   Trump had promised to release
  his medical records following questions from the news outlet Politico earlier this
  month.   In an interview with Barbara Walters, Trump's oldest children were asked
  what she would change about their father.   \"I want him to eat healthier,\" his
  daughter Ivanka said.   \"Less McDonalds,\" chimed his youngest daughter, Tiffany. 
   In a New York Times Magazine profile, Trump was quoted saying that he's not following
  any particular exercise regime. `'All my friends who work out all the time, they're
  going for knee replacements, hip replacements -- they're a disaster,\" he said. 
   Instead, the magazine wrote, \"he exerts himself fully by standing in front of
  an audience for an hour.\"   \"That's exercise,\" Trump told the magazine.   Still,
  Trump's physician said he's lost at least 15 pounds over the last 12 months.   Releasing
  health records has become a standard campaign practice, and several of Trump's rivals,
  including Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, and GOP rival Jeb Bush have already
  released statements of health from their doctors far more detailed than the one
  released by Trump.   Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said the doctor's letter
  is the only record of his health the campaign intends to release.   A two-page letter
  by Clinton's physician included references to her hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen
  allergies, as well as a 2009 elbow fracture and 2012 concussion that continues to
  stokes concerns about her health.   It also described the 68-year-old's exercise
  regimen and diet  -- \"rich in lean protein, vegetables and fruits\" -- and outlined
  her parents' medical histories, as well as providing her blood pressure, heart rate
  and cholesterol readings.   Bush's physician outlined a medical history that included
  a past vitamin D insufficiency, gastritis, colon polyps, sinusitis, and low back
  pain. The letter also spelled out his body mass index, cholesterol and pulse, in
  addition his blood pressure and daily medications.Older candidates have tended to
  face the most scrutiny when it comes to questions about their health.   Sen. John
  McCain, for instance, faced concerns about his age as well as a medical history
  when he ran for president that included several bouts with melanoma. His 2008 campaign
  released eight years of McCain's medical records as it sought to prove that McCain,
  then-71, was healthy enough for the presidency.   Bob Dole's advanced age also raised
  concerns when he ran for president in 1996.AdvertisementAdvertisement©2015 FOX News

  \               Donald Trump released a glowing letter from his physician Monday
  declaring that the Republican presidential candidate will be \"the healthiest individual
  ever elected to the presidency\" if he wins in 2016.   \n                \n                \r\n\n
  \           \n                The letter from Dr. Jacob Bornstein of Lenox Hill
  Hospital, identified as Trump's personal physician since 1980, was released after
  Trump promised to disclose his medical records amid questions about the billionaire
  businessman's health.   \n                \n                \r\n\n            \n
  \               Trump, 69, has acknowledged eating a less-than-healthy diet -- heavy
  on McDonalds -- and said his primary form of exercise consists of speaking at campaign
  events.   \n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                \"I
  love steak and hamburger and pasta and French fries -- all the things we shouldn't
  be eating,\" he said during an interview this fall on Bloomberg's \"With All Due
  Respect.\"   \n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                Nonetheless,
  his medical evaluation -- a glowing, four-paragraph assessment, written in similar
  language to that used by Trump himself -- said the GOP front-runner has suffered
  no significant medical problems over the past 39 years.   \n                \n                \r\n\n
  \           \n                A recent exam, Bornstein wrote, \"showed only positive
  results,\" with a blood pressure rating of 110/65 and laboratory test results he
  described as \"astonishingly excellent.\"   \n                \n                \r\n\n
  \           \n                Trump takes aspirin and a low dose of statins daily,
  but has suffered no form of cancer or joint replacement.   \n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                \"His physical strength and
  stamina are extraordinary,\" Bornstein added, saying Trump's only surgery was an
  appendectomy at the age of 10.   \n                \n                \r\n\n            \n
  \               Trump, who does not smoke or drink alcohol, often likes to boast
  of his stamina on the campaign trail, despite logging far fewer events than many
  other candidates.   \n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                Trump
  had promised to release his medical records following questions from the news outlet
  Politico earlier this month.   In an interview with Barbara Walters, Trump's oldest
  children were asked what she would change about their father.   \n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                \"I want him to eat healthier,\"
  his daughter Ivanka said.   \"Less McDonalds,\" chimed his youngest daughter, Tiffany. 
   \n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                In a New
  York Times Magazine profile, Trump was quoted saying that he's not following any
  particular exercise regime. `'All my friends who work out all the time, they're
  going for knee replacements, hip replacements -- they're a disaster,\" he said. 
   Instead, the magazine wrote, \"he exerts himself fully by standing in front of
  an audience for an hour.\"   \n                \n                \r\n\n            \n
  \               \"That's exercise,\" Trump told the magazine.   \n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                Still, Trump's physician said
  he's lost at least 15 pounds over the last 12 months.   Releasing health records
  has become a standard campaign practice, and several of Trump's rivals, including
  Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, and GOP rival Jeb Bush have already released
  statements of health from their doctors far more detailed than the one released
  by Trump.   \n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                Trump
  campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said the doctor's letter is the only record of his
  health the campaign intends to release.   A two-page letter by Clinton's physician
  included references to her hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies, as well
  as a 2009 elbow fracture and 2012 concussion that continues to stokes concerns about
  her health.   \n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                It
  also described the 68-year-old's exercise regimen and diet  -- \"rich in lean protein,
  vegetables and fruits\" -- and outlined her parents' medical histories, as well
  as providing her blood pressure, heart rate and cholesterol readings.   \n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                Bush's physician outlined a
  medical history that included a past vitamin D insufficiency, gastritis, colon polyps,
  sinusitis, and low back pain. The letter also spelled out his body mass index, cholesterol
  and pulse, in addition his blood pressure and daily medications.\n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                Older candidates have tended
  to face the most scrutiny when it comes to questions about their health.   \n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                Sen. John McCain, for instance,
  faced concerns about his age as well as a medical history when he ran for president
  that included several bouts with melanoma. His 2008 campaign released eight years
  of McCain's medical records as it sought to prove that McCain, then-71, was healthy
  enough for the presidency.   \n                \n                \r\n\n            \n
  \               Bob Dole's advanced age also raised concerns when he ran for president
  in 1996.\n                \n                \r\n\n            \n\n            \n

  \               Donald Trump released a glowing letter from his physician Monday
  declaring that the Republican presidential candidate will be \"the healthiest individual
  ever elected to the presidency\" if he wins in 2016.   The letter from Dr. Jacob
  Bornstein of Lenox Hill Hospital, identified as Trump's personal physician since
  1980, was released after Trump promised to disclose his medical records amid questions
  about the billionaire businessman's health.   Trump, 69, has acknowledged eating
  a less-than-healthy diet -- heavy on McDonalds -- and said his primary form of exercise
  consists of speaking at campaign events.   \"I love steak and hamburger and pasta
  and French fries -- all the things we shouldn't be eating,\" he said during an interview
  this fall on Bloomberg's \"With All Due Respect.\"   Nonetheless, his medical evaluation
  -- a glowing, four-paragraph assessment, written in similar language to that used
  by Trump himself -- said the GOP front-runner has suffered no significant medical
  problems over the past 39 years.   A recent exam, Bornstein wrote, \"showed only
  positive results,\" with a blood pressure rating of 110/65 and laboratory test results
  he described as \"astonishingly excellent.\"   Trump takes aspirin and a low dose
  of statins daily, but has suffered no form of cancer or joint replacement.   \"His
  physical strength and stamina are extraordinary,\" Bornstein added, saying Trump's
  only surgery was an appendectomy at the age of 10.   Trump, who does not smoke or
  drink alcohol, often likes to boast of his stamina on the campaign trail, despite
  logging far fewer events than many other candidates.   Trump had promised to release
  his medical records following questions from the news outlet Politico earlier this
  month.   In an interview with Barbara Walters, Trump's oldest children were asked
  what she would change about their father.   \"I want him to eat healthier,\" his
  daughter Ivanka said.   \"Less McDonalds,\" chimed his youngest daughter, Tiffany. 
   In a New York Times Magazine profile, Trump was quoted saying that he's not following
  any particular exercise regime. `'All my friends who work out all the time, they're
  going for knee replacements, hip replacements -- they're a disaster,\" he said. 
   Instead, the magazine wrote, \"he exerts himself fully by standing in front of
  an audience for an hour.\"   \"That's exercise,\" Trump told the magazine.   Still,
  Trump's physician said he's lost at least 15 pounds over the last 12 months.   Releasing
  health records has become a standard campaign practice, and several of Trump's rivals,
  including Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, and GOP rival Jeb Bush have already
  released statements of health from their doctors far more detailed than the one
  released by Trump.   Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said the doctor's letter
  is the only record of his health the campaign intends to release.   A two-page letter
  by Clinton's physician included references to her hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen
  allergies, as well as a 2009 elbow fracture and 2012 concussion that continues to
  stokes concerns about her health.   It also described the 68-year-old's exercise
  regimen and diet  -- \"rich in lean protein, vegetables and fruits\" -- and outlined
  her parents' medical histories, as well as providing her blood pressure, heart rate
  and cholesterol readings.   Bush's physician outlined a medical history that included
  a past vitamin D insufficiency, gastritis, colon polyps, sinusitis, and low back
  pain. The letter also spelled out his body mass index, cholesterol and pulse, in
  addition his blood pressure and daily medications.Older candidates have tended to
  face the most scrutiny when it comes to questions about their health.   Sen. John
  McCain, for instance, faced concerns about his age as well as a medical history
  when he ran for president that included several bouts with melanoma. His 2008 campaign
  released eight years of McCain's medical records as it sought to prove that McCain,
  then-71, was healthy enough for the presidency.   Bob Dole's advanced age also raised
  concerns when he ran for president in 1996.AdvertisementAdvertisement©2015 FOX News
