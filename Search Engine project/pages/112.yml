  Science Journalists augurs well for the future of the profession. But it needs to
  maintain its independence, and avoid becoming an extension of the public relations
  industry.\rAustralia's science journalists have a hard act to follow. Last week
  — somewhat to their own surprise — their Canadian counterparts managed to attract
  a full house of 500 colleagues from across the world to Montréal for the 4th World
  Conference of Science Journalists. There they were exposed to three days of stimulating
  talks, debate and discussion about the state of their profession.\rAt the end of
  the meeting, a decision was taken by representatives of national science writing
  associations that the next of these biannual meetings should be held in Melbourne,
  Australia, in 2006 (or perhaps early 2007). The choice was itself something of a
  surprise; a number of strong competing applications had been received, in particular
  from China and Italy. But the Australian delegation had come with a well-prepared
  bid stressing, among other aspects, the country's links with South-east Asia, a
  region in which science journalism remains relatively weak.\rFor many of those attending
  the Montréal meeting, its most significant message was contained in the way that
  a series of speakers underlined the importance of their role as a channel of communication
  between scientists and society — and the challenges they face in carrying out this
  role effectively. Maureen O'Neill, for example, the president of Canada's International
  Development Research Centre (one of the main sponsors of the meeting) emphasised
  this point in her opening address, placing particular role on the need for this
  task within developing countries (See 'Science journalists play critical role in
  decision-making').  \rFor the experienced journalists present, the message was a
  familiar one. But for those relatively new to the profession, particularly those
  in many parts of the developing world struggling to establish their professional
  identity as science writers in a media world dominated by a reporting of politics
  and sport, the message provided welcome reassurance about the importance of their
  chosen path.\rExternal pressures\rYet the meeting also provided several warnings
  about the narrowness of this path, and the pressures that can knock off balance
  those who seek to go down it. Many such pressures come from those with a vested
  interested in seeing their activities reported in a particular way. Sometimes such
  pressure is explicit and obvious. In other cases, the origins may be less clear
  (for example, when political pressure on a newspaper becomes transformed into an
  editorial judgement about news values imposed by senior editorial staff on junior
  reporters).\rDifficult as such pressures may be to resist, each can conflict with
  the responsibility of a journalist firstly to remain as faithful as possible to
  the facts, and secondly to use his or her best judgement of what is significant
  about such facts. Neither of these requires objectivity about the issue being described;
  the best journalists are those who can be passionate about the subjects that they
  cover. But they do demand that, however strong the passion, journalists retain a
  critical edge in their reporting that is sufficient to ensure the independence of
  their personal, informed judgement.\rSeveral warnings about ways in which this independence
  of judgement can be threatened were presented to the Montréal conference. One speaker,
  for example, warned journalists of the need for caution in reporting on the results
  of clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products, however well dressed up these
  may be in a cloak of scientific plausibility. For example, supporting papers from
  scientific journals may be provided with an inadequate interpretation of the data
  contained in such papers (See 'Journalists warn of helping drug giants 'market disease'').\rIn
  another session, SciDev.Net's Beijing correspondent, Jia Hepeng, spoke of the difficulties
  facing journalists in China as the government seeks to control the distribution
  of information about sensitive topics such as the spread of the SARS virus. Criticism
  (much of it from outside China) about an initial lack of openness had helped to
  overcome the first hurdle faced by Chinese reporters, namely a sheer lack of information.
  But, said Jia, that had now been replaced by an equally daunting challenge, namely
  discovering the reality behind the facts and figures being presented in the name
  of an apparent transparency.\rIn South Africa, a similar issue faces journalists
  who seek to report on the spread of HIV/AIDS. As Tamar Kahn, another SciDev.Net
  contributor, told the meeting, the task has become easier as a result of the government
  overcoming its previous reluctance to acknowledge the size of the AIDS problem it
  faces. But the tendency of government officials to play down the problem remains
  reflected in the difficulties faced by individual journalists in getting their stories
  accepted for publication. Kahn reports on her own difficulties in persuading her
  news editor to give a story about South Africa's AIDS epidemic reaching record proportions
  more than two short paragraphs on an inside page (see 'Controversy and science reporting
  in South Africa').\rThe need for independence\rIn such instances, it is usually
  relatively clear what the proper function of the science journalist should be. Equally
  important, however, is to retain the same independent stance when writing about
  science itself. There has been a tendency in recent years to assume that science
  journalists should, almost by definition, be part of the 'science promotion' business.
  This is particularly strong among those who argue that the low esteem in which science
  is widely held is primarily the results of a 'bad press' — and that science journalists
  have a responsibility to help reverse this situation.\rIt is certainly true that
  what often distinguishes science journalists from their colleagues is greater knowledge
  of — and respect for — the way that science operates. Indeed one of the main reasons
  for promoting science journalism around the world is precisely to ensure that when
  science is written about, it is done in an informed manner.\rBut that is not the
  same as endorsing everything that is said or done in the name of science (any more
  than an art critic is expected to endorse everything that is done in the name of
  art). In other words, science journalists should not be seen, or see themselves,
  as part of a public relations effort, however much those responsibility for promoting
  a particular scientific activity or programme seek to recruit them their cause.\rBlurring
  the line\rIf there was a criticism to be made of the Montréal meeting, it was the
  extent to which some of those who had generously provided sponsorship to cover the
  travel and accommodation costs of foreign participants (particularly from developing
  countries) appeared to feel justified in subsequently using the conference as a
  promotional platform. In principle, of course, there is no reason that they should
  not do so; after all, no-one complains when the sponsor of a sporting event demands
  that a company logo be prominently featured in television coverage of that event.\rThe
  danger lies in blurring the line between journalism and public relations. When that
  happens, a journalist is denying his or her responsibility to exercise a personal
  judgement of what is significant by substituting for it the judgement of others
  (who may have their own financial or political agenda). One response of the profession
  must lie in an insistence on editorial independence as a guarantor of journalistic
  integrity. A second lies in the need to ensure that a political commitment to the
  freedom of the press is adequately reflected in practice.\rHopefully, the Australian
  organisers of the next world conference will bear the need to address these in mind
  when planning their programme. There certainly needs to be space on the programme
  to explore ways in which science journalists can ensure that the media adequately
  acknowledges and reflects the role of science in modern societies, both developed
  and developing. And the meeting will obviously be a useful vehicle for creating
  a greater global awareness of Australia's scientific and technological achievements.\rEqually
  important, however, is that the meeting should address in detail some of the key
  challenges faced by science journalists around the world as they strive to create
  the conditions under which their profession can flourish. The Montréal meeting made
  a good start, and provided some important openings in this direction. The baton
  has now been passed to others to find ways of ensuring that this work is continued.\rRelated

  the conditions under which their profession can flourish. The Montréal meeting made
  a good start, and provided some important openings in this direction. The baton
  has now been passed to others to find ways of ensuring that this work is continued.\rRelated

  augurs well for the future of the profession. But it needs to maintain its independence,
  and avoid becoming an extension of the public relations industry.Australia's science
  journalists have a hard act to follow. Last week — somewhat to their own surprise
  — their Canadian counterparts managed to attract a full house of 500 colleagues
  from across the world to Montréal for the 4th World Conference of Science Journalists.
  There they were exposed to three days of stimulating talks, debate and discussion
  about the state of their profession.At the end of the meeting, a decision was taken
  by representatives of national science writing associations that the next of these
  biannual meetings should be held in Melbourne, Australia, in 2006 (or perhaps early
  2007). The choice was itself something of a surprise; a number of strong competing
  applications had been received, in particular from China and Italy. But the Australian
  delegation had come with a well-prepared bid stressing, among other aspects, the
  country's links with South-east Asia, a region in which science journalism remains
  relatively weak.For many of those attending the Montréal meeting, its most significant
  message was contained in the way that a series of speakers underlined the importance
  of their role as a channel of communication between scientists and society — and
  the challenges they face in carrying out this role effectively. Maureen O'Neill,
  for example, the president of Canada's International Development Research Centre
  (one of the main sponsors of the meeting) emphasised this point in her opening address,
  placing particular role on the need for this task within developing countries (See
  'Science journalists play critical role in decision-making').  For the experienced
  journalists present, the message was a familiar one. But for those relatively new
  to the profession, particularly those in many parts of the developing world struggling
  to establish their professional identity as science writers in a media world dominated
  by a reporting of politics and sport, the message provided welcome reassurance about
  the importance of their chosen path.External pressuresYet the meeting also provided
  several warnings about the narrowness of this path, and the pressures that can knock
  off balance those who seek to go down it. Many such pressures come from those with
  a vested interested in seeing their activities reported in a particular way. Sometimes
  such pressure is explicit and obvious. In other cases, the origins may be less clear
  (for example, when political pressure on a newspaper becomes transformed into an
  editorial judgement about news values imposed by senior editorial staff on junior
  reporters).Difficult as such pressures may be to resist, each can conflict with
  the responsibility of a journalist firstly to remain as faithful as possible to
  the facts, and secondly to use his or her best judgement of what is significant
  about such facts. Neither of these requires objectivity about the issue being described;
  the best journalists are those who can be passionate about the subjects that they
  cover. But they do demand that, however strong the passion, journalists retain a
  critical edge in their reporting that is sufficient to ensure the independence of
  their personal, informed judgement.Several warnings about ways in which this independence
  of judgement can be threatened were presented to the Montréal conference. One speaker,
  for example, warned journalists of the need for caution in reporting on the results
  of clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products, however well dressed up these
  may be in a cloak of scientific plausibility. For example, supporting papers from
  scientific journals may be provided with an inadequate interpretation of the data
  contained in such papers (See 'Journalists warn of helping drug giants 'market disease'').In
  another session, SciDev.Net's Beijing correspondent, Jia Hepeng, spoke of the difficulties
  facing journalists in China as the government seeks to control the distribution
  of information about sensitive topics such as the spread of the SARS virus. Criticism
  (much of it from outside China) about an initial lack of openness had helped to
  overcome the first hurdle faced by Chinese reporters, namely a sheer lack of information.
  But, said Jia, that had now been replaced by an equally daunting challenge, namely
  discovering the reality behind the facts and figures being presented in the name
  of an apparent transparency.In South Africa, a similar issue faces journalists who
  seek to report on the spread of HIV/AIDS. As Tamar Kahn, another SciDev.Net contributor,
  told the meeting, the task has become easier as a result of the government overcoming
  its previous reluctance to acknowledge the size of the AIDS problem it faces. But
  the tendency of government officials to play down the problem remains reflected
  in the difficulties faced by individual journalists in getting their stories accepted
  for publication. Kahn reports on her own difficulties in persuading her news editor
  to give a story about South Africa's AIDS epidemic reaching record proportions more
  than two short paragraphs on an inside page (see 'Controversy and science reporting
  in South Africa').The need for independenceIn such instances, it is usually relatively
  clear what the proper function of the science journalist should be. Equally important,
  however, is to retain the same independent stance when writing about science itself.
  There has been a tendency in recent years to assume that science journalists should,
  almost by definition, be part of the 'science promotion' business. This is particularly
  strong among those who argue that the low esteem in which science is widely held
  is primarily the results of a 'bad press' — and that science journalists have a
  responsibility to help reverse this situation.It is certainly true that what often
  distinguishes science journalists from their colleagues is greater knowledge of
  — and respect for — the way that science operates. Indeed one of the main reasons
  for promoting science journalism around the world is precisely to ensure that when
  science is written about, it is done in an informed manner.But that is not the same
  as endorsing everything that is said or done in the name of science (any more than
  an art critic is expected to endorse everything that is done in the name of art).
  In other words, science journalists should not be seen, or see themselves, as part
  of a public relations effort, however much those responsibility for promoting a
  particular scientific activity or programme seek to recruit them their cause.Blurring
  the lineIf there was a criticism to be made of the Montréal meeting, it was the
  extent to which some of those who had generously provided sponsorship to cover the
  travel and accommodation costs of foreign participants (particularly from developing
  countries) appeared to feel justified in subsequently using the conference as a
  promotional platform. In principle, of course, there is no reason that they should
  not do so; after all, no-one complains when the sponsor of a sporting event demands
  that a company logo be prominently featured in television coverage of that event.The
  danger lies in blurring the line between journalism and public relations. When that
  happens, a journalist is denying his or her responsibility to exercise a personal
  judgement of what is significant by substituting for it the judgement of others
  (who may have their own financial or political agenda). One response of the profession
  must lie in an insistence on editorial independence as a guarantor of journalistic
  integrity. A second lies in the need to ensure that a political commitment to the
  freedom of the press is adequately reflected in practice.Hopefully, the Australian
  organisers of the next world conference will bear the need to address these in mind
  when planning their programme. There certainly needs to be space on the programme
  to explore ways in which science journalists can ensure that the media adequately
  acknowledges and reflects the role of science in modern societies, both developed
  and developing. And the meeting will obviously be a useful vehicle for creating
  a greater global awareness of Australia's scientific and technological achievements.Equally
  important, however, is that the meeting should address in detail some of the key
  challenges faced by science journalists around the world as they strive to create
  the conditions under which their profession can flourish. The Montréal meeting made

  Science Journalists augurs well for the future of the profession. But it needs to
  maintain its independence, and avoid becoming an extension of the public relations
  industry.\rAustralia's science journalists have a hard act to follow. Last week
  — somewhat to their own surprise — their Canadian counterparts managed to attract
  a full house of 500 colleagues from across the world to Montréal for the 4th World
  Conference of Science Journalists. There they were exposed to three days of stimulating
  talks, debate and discussion about the state of their profession.\rAt the end of
  the meeting, a decision was taken by representatives of national science writing
  associations that the next of these biannual meetings should be held in Melbourne,
  Australia, in 2006 (or perhaps early 2007). The choice was itself something of a
  surprise; a number of strong competing applications had been received, in particular
  from China and Italy. But the Australian delegation had come with a well-prepared
  bid stressing, among other aspects, the country's links with South-east Asia, a
  region in which science journalism remains relatively weak.\rFor many of those attending
  the Montréal meeting, its most significant message was contained in the way that
  a series of speakers underlined the importance of their role as a channel of communication
  between scientists and society — and the challenges they face in carrying out this
  role effectively. Maureen O'Neill, for example, the president of Canada's International
  Development Research Centre (one of the main sponsors of the meeting) emphasised
  this point in her opening address, placing particular role on the need for this
  task within developing countries (See 'Science journalists play critical role in
  decision-making').  \rFor the experienced journalists present, the message was a
  familiar one. But for those relatively new to the profession, particularly those
  in many parts of the developing world struggling to establish their professional
  identity as science writers in a media world dominated by a reporting of politics
  and sport, the message provided welcome reassurance about the importance of their
  chosen path.\rExternal pressures\rYet the meeting also provided several warnings
  about the narrowness of this path, and the pressures that can knock off balance
  those who seek to go down it. Many such pressures come from those with a vested
  interested in seeing their activities reported in a particular way. Sometimes such
  pressure is explicit and obvious. In other cases, the origins may be less clear
  (for example, when political pressure on a newspaper becomes transformed into an
  editorial judgement about news values imposed by senior editorial staff on junior
  reporters).\rDifficult as such pressures may be to resist, each can conflict with
  the responsibility of a journalist firstly to remain as faithful as possible to
  the facts, and secondly to use his or her best judgement of what is significant
  about such facts. Neither of these requires objectivity about the issue being described;
  the best journalists are those who can be passionate about the subjects that they
  cover. But they do demand that, however strong the passion, journalists retain a
  critical edge in their reporting that is sufficient to ensure the independence of
  their personal, informed judgement.\rSeveral warnings about ways in which this independence
  of judgement can be threatened were presented to the Montréal conference. One speaker,
  for example, warned journalists of the need for caution in reporting on the results
  of clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products, however well dressed up these
  may be in a cloak of scientific plausibility. For example, supporting papers from
  scientific journals may be provided with an inadequate interpretation of the data
  contained in such papers (See 'Journalists warn of helping drug giants 'market disease'').\rIn
  another session, SciDev.Net's Beijing correspondent, Jia Hepeng, spoke of the difficulties
  facing journalists in China as the government seeks to control the distribution
  of information about sensitive topics such as the spread of the SARS virus. Criticism
  (much of it from outside China) about an initial lack of openness had helped to
  overcome the first hurdle faced by Chinese reporters, namely a sheer lack of information.
  But, said Jia, that had now been replaced by an equally daunting challenge, namely
  discovering the reality behind the facts and figures being presented in the name
  of an apparent transparency.\rIn South Africa, a similar issue faces journalists
  who seek to report on the spread of HIV/AIDS. As Tamar Kahn, another SciDev.Net
  contributor, told the meeting, the task has become easier as a result of the government
  overcoming its previous reluctance to acknowledge the size of the AIDS problem it
  faces. But the tendency of government officials to play down the problem remains
  reflected in the difficulties faced by individual journalists in getting their stories
  accepted for publication. Kahn reports on her own difficulties in persuading her
  news editor to give a story about South Africa's AIDS epidemic reaching record proportions
  more than two short paragraphs on an inside page (see 'Controversy and science reporting
  in South Africa').\rThe need for independence\rIn such instances, it is usually
  relatively clear what the proper function of the science journalist should be. Equally
  important, however, is to retain the same independent stance when writing about
  science itself. There has been a tendency in recent years to assume that science
  journalists should, almost by definition, be part of the 'science promotion' business.
  This is particularly strong among those who argue that the low esteem in which science
  is widely held is primarily the results of a 'bad press' — and that science journalists
  have a responsibility to help reverse this situation.\rIt is certainly true that
  what often distinguishes science journalists from their colleagues is greater knowledge
  of — and respect for — the way that science operates. Indeed one of the main reasons
  for promoting science journalism around the world is precisely to ensure that when
  science is written about, it is done in an informed manner.\rBut that is not the
  same as endorsing everything that is said or done in the name of science (any more
  than an art critic is expected to endorse everything that is done in the name of
  art). In other words, science journalists should not be seen, or see themselves,
  as part of a public relations effort, however much those responsibility for promoting
  a particular scientific activity or programme seek to recruit them their cause.\rBlurring
  the line\rIf there was a criticism to be made of the Montréal meeting, it was the
  extent to which some of those who had generously provided sponsorship to cover the
  travel and accommodation costs of foreign participants (particularly from developing
  countries) appeared to feel justified in subsequently using the conference as a
  promotional platform. In principle, of course, there is no reason that they should
  not do so; after all, no-one complains when the sponsor of a sporting event demands
  that a company logo be prominently featured in television coverage of that event.\rThe
  danger lies in blurring the line between journalism and public relations. When that
  happens, a journalist is denying his or her responsibility to exercise a personal
  judgement of what is significant by substituting for it the judgement of others
  (who may have their own financial or political agenda). One response of the profession
  must lie in an insistence on editorial independence as a guarantor of journalistic
  integrity. A second lies in the need to ensure that a political commitment to the
  freedom of the press is adequately reflected in practice.\rHopefully, the Australian
  organisers of the next world conference will bear the need to address these in mind
  when planning their programme. There certainly needs to be space on the programme
  to explore ways in which science journalists can ensure that the media adequately
  acknowledges and reflects the role of science in modern societies, both developed
  and developing. And the meeting will obviously be a useful vehicle for creating
  a greater global awareness of Australia's scientific and technological achievements.\rEqually
  important, however, is that the meeting should address in detail some of the key
  challenges faced by science journalists around the world as they strive to create
  the conditions under which their profession can flourish. The Montréal meeting made
  a good start, and provided some important openings in this direction. The baton
  has now been passed to others to find ways of ensuring that this work is continued.\rRelated

  (one of the main sponsors of the meeting) emphasised this point in her opening address,
  placing particular role on the need for this task within developing countries (See
  'Science journalists play critical role in decision-making').  \rFor the experienced
  journalists present, the message was a familiar one. But for those relatively new
  to the profession, particularly those in many parts of the developing world struggling
  to establish their professional identity as science writers in a media world dominated
  by a reporting of politics and sport, the message provided welcome reassurance about
  the importance of their chosen path.\rExternal pressures\rYet the meeting also provided
  several warnings about the narrowness of this path, and the pressures that can knock
  off balance those who seek to go down it. Many such pressures come from those with
  a vested interested in seeing their activities reported in a particular way. Sometimes
  such pressure is explicit and obvious. In other cases, the origins may be less clear
  (for example, when political pressure on a newspaper becomes transformed into an
  editorial judgement about news values imposed by senior editorial staff on junior
  reporters).\rDifficult as such pressures may be to resist, each can conflict with
  the responsibility of a journalist firstly to remain as faithful as possible to
  the facts, and secondly to use his or her best judgement of what is significant
  about such facts. Neither of these requires objectivity about the issue being described;
  the best journalists are those who can be passionate about the subjects that they
  cover. But they do demand that, however strong the passion, journalists retain a
  critical edge in their reporting that is sufficient to ensure the independence of
  their personal, informed judgement.\rSeveral warnings about ways in which this independence
  of judgement can be threatened were presented to the Montréal conference. One speaker,
  for example, warned journalists of the need for caution in reporting on the results
  of clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products, however well dressed up these
  may be in a cloak of scientific plausibility. For example, supporting papers from
  scientific journals may be provided with an inadequate interpretation of the data
  contained in such papers (See 'Journalists warn of helping drug giants 'market disease'').\rIn
  another session, SciDev.Net's Beijing correspondent, Jia Hepeng, spoke of the difficulties
  facing journalists in China as the government seeks to control the distribution
  of information about sensitive topics such as the spread of the SARS virus. Criticism
  (much of it from outside China) about an initial lack of openness had helped to
  overcome the first hurdle faced by Chinese reporters, namely a sheer lack of information.
  But, said Jia, that had now been replaced by an equally daunting challenge, namely
  discovering the reality behind the facts and figures being presented in the name
  of an apparent transparency.\rIn South Africa, a similar issue faces journalists
  who seek to report on the spread of HIV/AIDS. As Tamar Kahn, another SciDev.Net
  contributor, told the meeting, the task has become easier as a result of the government
  overcoming its previous reluctance to acknowledge the size of the AIDS problem it
  faces. But the tendency of government officials to play down the problem remains
  reflected in the difficulties faced by individual journalists in getting their stories
  accepted for publication. Kahn reports on her own difficulties in persuading her
  news editor to give a story about South Africa's AIDS epidemic reaching record proportions
  more than two short paragraphs on an inside page (see 'Controversy and science reporting
  in South Africa').\rThe need for independence\rIn such instances, it is usually
  relatively clear what the proper function of the science journalist should be. Equally
  important, however, is to retain the same independent stance when writing about
  science itself. There has been a tendency in recent years to assume that science
  journalists should, almost by definition, be part of the 'science promotion' business.
  This is particularly strong among those who argue that the low esteem in which science
  is widely held is primarily the results of a 'bad press' — and that science journalists
  have a responsibility to help reverse this situation.\rIt is certainly true that
  what often distinguishes science journalists from their colleagues is greater knowledge
  of — and respect for — the way that science operates. Indeed one of the main reasons
  for promoting science journalism around the world is precisely to ensure that when
  science is written about, it is done in an informed manner.\rBut that is not the
  same as endorsing everything that is said or done in the name of science (any more
  than an art critic is expected to endorse everything that is done in the name of
  art). In other words, science journalists should not be seen, or see themselves,
  as part of a public relations effort, however much those responsibility for promoting
  a particular scientific activity or programme seek to recruit them their cause.\rBlurring
  the line\rIf there was a criticism to be made of the Montréal meeting, it was the
  extent to which some of those who had generously provided sponsorship to cover the
  travel and accommodation costs of foreign participants (particularly from developing
  countries) appeared to feel justified in subsequently using the conference as a
  promotional platform. In principle, of course, there is no reason that they should
  not do so; after all, no-one complains when the sponsor of a sporting event demands
  that a company logo be prominently featured in television coverage of that event.\rThe
  danger lies in blurring the line between journalism and public relations. When that
  happens, a journalist is denying his or her responsibility to exercise a personal
  judgement of what is significant by substituting for it the judgement of others
  (who may have their own financial or political agenda). One response of the profession
  must lie in an insistence on editorial independence as a guarantor of journalistic
  integrity. A second lies in the need to ensure that a political commitment to the
  freedom of the press is adequately reflected in practice.\rHopefully, the Australian
  organisers of the next world conference will bear the need to address these in mind
  when planning their programme. There certainly needs to be space on the programme
  to explore ways in which science journalists can ensure that the media adequately
  acknowledges and reflects the role of science in modern societies, both developed
  and developing. And the meeting will obviously be a useful vehicle for creating
  a greater global awareness of Australia's scientific and technological achievements.\rEqually
  important, however, is that the meeting should address in detail some of the key
  challenges faced by science journalists around the world as they strive to create
  the conditions under which their profession can flourish. The Montréal meeting made
  a good start, and provided some important openings in this direction. The baton
  has now been passed to others to find ways of ensuring that this work is continued.\rRelated

  augurs well for the future of the profession. But it needs to maintain its independence,
  and avoid becoming an extension of the public relations industry.Australia's science
  journalists have a hard act to follow. Last week — somewhat to their own surprise
  — their Canadian counterparts managed to attract a full house of 500 colleagues
  from across the world to Montréal for the 4th World Conference of Science Journalists.
  There they were exposed to three days of stimulating talks, debate and discussion
  about the state of their profession.At the end of the meeting, a decision was taken
  by representatives of national science writing associations that the next of these
  biannual meetings should be held in Melbourne, Australia, in 2006 (or perhaps early
  2007). The choice was itself something of a surprise; a number of strong competing
  applications had been received, in particular from China and Italy. But the Australian
  delegation had come with a well-prepared bid stressing, among other aspects, the
  country's links with South-east Asia, a region in which science journalism remains
  relatively weak.For many of those attending the Montréal meeting, its most significant

  of their role as a channel of communication between scientists and society — and

  For example, supporting papers from scientific journals may be provided with an
  inadequate interpretation of the data contained in such papers (See 'Journalists
  warn of helping drug giants 'market disease'').In another session, SciDev.Net's
  Beijing correspondent, Jia Hepeng, spoke of the difficulties facing journalists
  in China as the government seeks to control the distribution of information about
  sensitive topics such as the spread of the SARS virus. Criticism (much of it from
  outside China) about an initial lack of openness had helped to overcome the first
  hurdle faced by Chinese reporters, namely a sheer lack of information. But, said
  Jia, that had now been replaced by an equally daunting challenge, namely discovering
  the reality behind the facts and figures being presented in the name of an apparent
  transparency.In South Africa, a similar issue faces journalists who seek to report
  on the spread of HIV/AIDS. As Tamar Kahn, another SciDev.Net contributor, told the
  meeting, the task has become easier as a result of the government overcoming its
  previous reluctance to acknowledge the size of the AIDS problem it faces. But the
  tendency of government officials to play down the problem remains reflected in the
  difficulties faced by individual journalists in getting their stories accepted for
  publication. Kahn reports on her own difficulties in persuading her news editor
  to give a story about South Africa's AIDS epidemic reaching record proportions more
  than two short paragraphs on an inside page (see 'Controversy and science reporting
  in South Africa').The need for independenceIn such instances, it is usually relatively
  clear what the proper function of the science journalist should be. Equally important,
  however, is to retain the same independent stance when writing about science itself.
  There has been a tendency in recent years to assume that science journalists should,
  almost by definition, be part of the 'science promotion' business. This is particularly
  strong among those who argue that the low esteem in which science is widely held
  is primarily the results of a 'bad press' — and that science journalists have a
  responsibility to help reverse this situation.It is certainly true that what often
  distinguishes science journalists from their colleagues is greater knowledge of
  — and respect for — the way that science operates. Indeed one of the main reasons
  for promoting science journalism around the world is precisely to ensure that when
  science is written about, it is done in an informed manner.But that is not the same
  as endorsing everything that is said or done in the name of science (any more than
  an art critic is expected to endorse everything that is done in the name of art).
  In other words, science journalists should not be seen, or see themselves, as part
  of a public relations effort, however much those responsibility for promoting a
  particular scientific activity or programme seek to recruit them their cause.Blurring
  the lineIf there was a criticism to be made of the Montréal meeting, it was the
  extent to which some of those who had generously provided sponsorship to cover the
  travel and accommodation costs of foreign participants (particularly from developing
  countries) appeared to feel justified in subsequently using the conference as a
  promotional platform. In principle, of course, there is no reason that they should
  not do so; after all, no-one complains when the sponsor of a sporting event demands
  that a company logo be prominently featured in television coverage of that event.The
  danger lies in blurring the line between journalism and public relations. When that
  happens, a journalist is denying his or her responsibility to exercise a personal
  judgement of what is significant by substituting for it the judgement of others
  (who may have their own financial or political agenda). One response of the profession
  must lie in an insistence on editorial independence as a guarantor of journalistic
  integrity. A second lies in the need to ensure that a political commitment to the
  freedom of the press is adequately reflected in practice.Hopefully, the Australian
  organisers of the next world conference will bear the need to address these in mind
  when planning their programme. There certainly needs to be space on the programme
  to explore ways in which science journalists can ensure that the media adequately
  acknowledges and reflects the role of science in modern societies, both developed
  and developing. And the meeting will obviously be a useful vehicle for creating
  a greater global awareness of Australia's scientific and technological achievements.Equally
  important, however, is that the meeting should address in detail some of the key
  challenges faced by science journalists around the world as they strive to create
  the conditions under which their profession can flourish. The Montréal meeting made
  a good start, and provided some important openings in this direction. The baton
  has now been passed to others to find ways of ensuring that this work is continued.Related
