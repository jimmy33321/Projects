- "         1930s Berlin\r\n"
- "IBM specialized in selling tabulating machinery to help businesses and governments
  manage their data processing. All they did was count punched cards. The problems
  of automating the mathematics that Babbage had been attacking a century before had
  still not been cracked. That did not mean that the problems had gone away. In fact
  if anything they had become worse. In the early 1930s, a young German called Konrad
  Zuse was studying to become a civil engineer at a technical university in Berlin
  and was fed up plowing though endless simultaneous equations for his stress calculations.
  He resolved to develop a device to help with those calculations and started work
  developing the machine in his parents’ living room. By 1938, his first machine,
  known as the Z1, finally worked – sort of. The machine could generally be coaxed,
  one way or another, to produce the required answer but reliable it was not. It was
  a pure mechanical computer like that proposed by Babbage – unlike Babbage’s, it
  was based on the binary system which kept the mechanisms relatively simple. It should
  be said that Zuse was not aware of the work of Babbage or indeed anyone else in
  the field. He came up with the ideas on his own in order to save him doing boring
  repetitive calculations.\r\n"
- "The Zuse Z1 (linked from www.bnv-gz.de)\r\n"
- "The ‘success’ of the Z1 spurred Zuse on to replace the less reliable parts of his
  design with alternative solutions but in 1939, war was declared and Zuse was called
  up to the German military. He was sent to the infantry but was later re-assigned
  as a stress analyst on flying bomb development which left him some spare time to
  continue with his work on calculating machines. Working when he could, he completed
  the Z3 with the help of similarly-minded friends and in 1941 the Z3, the first functioning
  program-controlled calculating machine, was demonstrated to the aircraft construction
  authorities. They were impressed but simultaneously underwhelmed: this device was
  not going to win the war. There was no obvious point in improving it or replicating
  it for pure military reasons. Nevertheless, the Z3 was used by the German Aircraft
  Research Institute in solving a number of problems, most notably that of ‘wing flutter’,
  but the research institute was not a high enough priority to allow Zuse to be released
  from his day job of stress analysis.  \r\n"
- "The Z3 he demonstrated was an ‘electro-mechanical’ device based on relays. Relays
  are similar, in a sense, to a domestic door-bell where a plunger is moved by an
  electro-magnet to hit a chime. In a relay the electrical contacts are used to move
  a switch. A single relay on its own is an extremely dumb device. In order to make
  a machine that can perform a complex task, many relays have to be wired together
  so that they can interact. The Z3 contained around 2600 interconnected relays, each
  wired to make decisions based on the settings of others.  \r\n"
- "A replica of the Zuse Z3 (linked from www.bnv-gz.de)\r\n"
- "The drawback of using relays in calculating machines is that they are restricted
  by Newton’s laws of motion. It takes time for the contacts to move between ‘on’
  and ‘off’ states and performing one calculation involves many, many such electro-mechanical
  decisions. Users of relay based computers had better have a good book to hand and
  be prepared to wait. The Z3 could only perform 3 additions per second or one multiplication
  every 5 seconds.\r\n"
- "In 1942, work started on the Z4, an improved Z3. Work was hampered by the lack
  of resources due to war. High quality paper was in short supply so the program input
  tapes were made from used 35 mm celluloid film, presumably from movies no-one wanted
  to watch. In the closing weeks of the war, as the allies closed on Berlin, the incomplete
  machine was loaded onto a railway truck and began an Odyssey to safety in the south.
  Tension was high when the British and Americans finally sought out the then mysterious
  ‘V4’ (V stood for experimental). They were concerned that this was the big brother
  to the unmanned ‘Vengeance’ flying bombs, the V1 and V2, that caused devastation
  as they rained down on London during the late stages of the war. There was universal
  relief when they discovered it was nothing but a seemingly useless mass of electrical
  components.   \r\n"

  specialized in selling tabulating machinery to help businesses and governments manage
  their data processing. All they did was count punched cards. The problems of automating
  the mathematics that Babbage had been attacking a century before had still not been
  cracked. That did not mean that the problems had gone away. In fact if anything
  they had become worse. In the early 1930s, a young German called Konrad Zuse was
  studying to become a civil engineer at a technical university in Berlin and was
  fed up plowing though endless simultaneous equations for his stress calculations.
  He resolved to develop a device to help with those calculations and started work
  developing the machine in his parents’ living room. By 1938, his first machine,
  known as the Z1, finally worked – sort of. The machine could generally be coaxed,
  one way or another, to produce the required answer but reliable it was not. It was
  a pure mechanical computer like that proposed by Babbage – unlike Babbage’s, it
  was based on the binary system which kept the mechanisms relatively simple. It should
  be said that Zuse was not aware of the work of Babbage or indeed anyone else in
  the field. He came up with the ideas on his own in order to save him doing boring
  repetitive calculations.\r\nThe Zuse Z1 (linked from www.bnv-gz.de)\r\nThe ‘success’
  of the Z1 spurred Zuse on to replace the less reliable parts of his design with
  alternative solutions but in 1939, war was declared and Zuse was called up to the
  German military. He was sent to the infantry but was later re-assigned as a stress
  analyst on flying bomb development which left him some spare time to continue with
  his work on calculating machines. Working when he could, he completed the Z3 with
  the help of similarly-minded friends and in 1941 the Z3, the first functioning program-controlled
  calculating machine, was demonstrated to the aircraft construction authorities.
  They were impressed but simultaneously underwhelmed: this device was not going to
  win the war. There was no obvious point in improving it or replicating it for pure
  military reasons. Nevertheless, the Z3 was used by the German Aircraft Research
  Institute in solving a number of problems, most notably that of ‘wing flutter’,
  but the research institute was not a high enough priority to allow Zuse to be released
  from his day job of stress analysis.  \r\nThe Z3 he demonstrated was an ‘electro-mechanical’
  device based on relays. Relays are similar, in a sense, to a domestic door-bell
  where a plunger is moved by an electro-magnet to hit a chime. In a relay the electrical
  contacts are used to move a switch. A single relay on its own is an extremely dumb
  device. In order to make a machine that can perform a complex task, many relays
  have to be wired together so that they can interact. The Z3 contained around 2600
  interconnected relays, each wired to make decisions based on the settings of others.
  \ \r\nA replica of the Zuse Z3 (linked from www.bnv-gz.de)\r\nThe drawback of using
  relays in calculating machines is that they are restricted by Newton’s laws of motion.
  It takes time for the contacts to move between ‘on’ and ‘off’ states and performing
  one calculation involves many, many such electro-mechanical decisions. Users of
  relay based computers had better have a good book to hand and be prepared to wait.
  The Z3 could only perform 3 additions per second or one multiplication every 5 seconds.\r\nIn
  1942, work started on the Z4, an improved Z3. Work was hampered by the lack of resources
  due to war. High quality paper was in short supply so the program input tapes were
  made from used 35 mm celluloid film, presumably from movies no-one wanted to watch.
  In the closing weeks of the war, as the allies closed on Berlin, the incomplete
  machine was loaded onto a railway truck and began an Odyssey to safety in the south.
  Tension was high when the British and Americans finally sought out the then mysterious
  ‘V4’ (V stood for experimental). They were concerned that this was the big brother
  to the unmanned ‘Vengeance’ flying bombs, the V1 and V2, that caused devastation
  as they rained down on London during the late stages of the war. There was universal
  relief when they discovered it was nothing but a seemingly useless mass of electrical
  components.   \r\n\t \r\n\t \t^ Top\r\n\t \r\n         \r\n            Previous
