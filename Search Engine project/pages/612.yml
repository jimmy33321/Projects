  Introduction
- |
  The Internet has revolutionized the computer and communications world like nothing before. The invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio, and computer set the stage for this unprecedented integration of capabilities. The Internet is at once a world-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism for information dissemination, and a medium for collaboration and interaction between individuals and their computers without regard for geographic location. The Internet represents one of the most successful examples of the benefits of sustained investment and commitment to research and development of information infrastructure. Beginning with the early research in packet switching, the government, industry and academia have been partners in evolving and deploying this exciting new technology. Today, terms like "bleiner@computer.org" and "http://www.acm.org" trip lightly off the tongue of the random person on the street. 1

  This is intended to be a brief, necessarily cursory and incomplete history. Much material currently exists about the Internet, covering history, technology, and usage. A trip to almost any bookstore will find shelves of material written about the Internet. 2

  In this paper,3 several of us involved in the development and evolution of the Internet share our views of its origins and history. This history revolves around four distinct aspects. There is the technological evolution that began with early research on packet switching and the ARPANET (and related technologies), and where current research continues to expand the horizons of the infrastructure along several dimensions, such as scale, performance, and higher-level functionality. There is the operations and management aspect of a global and complex operational infrastructure. There is the social aspect, which resulted in a broad community of Internauts working together to create and evolve the technology. And there is the commercialization aspect, resulting in an extremely effective transition of research results into a broadly deployed and available information infrastructure.
- |
  The Internet today is a widespread information infrastructure, the initial prototype of what is often called the National (or Global or Galactic) Information Infrastructure. Its history is complex and involves many aspects - technological, organizational, and community. And its influence reaches not only to the technical fields of computer communications but throughout society as we move toward increasing use of online tools to accomplish electronic commerce, information acquisition, and community operations.
- |
  Origins of the Internet
- |
  The first recorded description of the social interactions that could be enabled through networking was a series of memos written by J.C.R. Licklider of MIT in August 1962 discussing his "Galactic Network" concept. He envisioned a globally interconnected set of computers through which everyone could quickly access data and programs from any site. In spirit, the concept was very much like the Internet of today. Licklider was the first head of the computer research program at DARPA,4 starting in October 1962. While at DARPA he convinced his successors at DARPA, Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and MIT researcher Lawrence G. Roberts, of the importance of this networking concept.
- |
  Leonard Kleinrock at MIT published the first paper on packet switching theory in July 1961 and the first book on the subject in 1964. Kleinrock convinced Roberts of the theoretical feasibility of communications using packets rather than circuits, which was a major step along the path towards computer networking. The other key step was to make the computers talk together. To explore this, in 1965 working with Thomas Merrill, Roberts connected the TX-2 computer in Mass. to the Q-32 in California with a low speed dial-up telephone line creating the first (however small) wide-area computer network ever built. The result of this experiment was the realization that the time-shared computers could work well together, running programs and retrieving data as necessary on the remote machine, but that the circuit switched telephone system was totally inadequate for the job. Kleinrock's conviction of the need for packet switching was confirmed.
- |
  In late 1966 Roberts went to DARPA to develop the computer network concept and quickly put together his plan for the "ARPANET", publishing it in 1967. At the conference where he presented the paper, there was also a paper on a packet network concept from the UK by Donald Davies and Roger Scantlebury of NPL. Scantlebury told Roberts about the NPL work as well as that of Paul Baran and others at RAND. The RAND group had written a paper on packet switching networks for secure voice in the military in 1964. It happened that the work at MIT (1961-1967), at RAND (1962-1965), and at NPL (1964-1967) had all proceeded in parallel without any of the researchers knowing about the other work. The word "packet" was adopted from the work at NPL and the proposed line speed to be used in the ARPANET design was upgraded from 2.4 kbps to 50 kbps. 5
- |
  In August 1968, after Roberts and the DARPA funded community had refined the overall structure and specifications for the ARPANET, an RFQ was released by DARPA for the development of one of the key components, the packet switches called Interface Message Processors (IMP's). The RFQ was won in December 1968 by a group headed by Frank Heart at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN). As the BBN team worked on the IMP's with Bob Kahn playing a major role in the overall ARPANET architectural design, the network topology and economics were designed and optimized by Roberts working with Howard Frank and his team at Network Analysis Corporation, and the network measurement system was prepared by Kleinrock's team at UCLA. 6
- |
  Due to Kleinrock's early development of packet switching theory and his focus on analysis, design and measurement, his Network Measurement Center at UCLA was selected to be the first node on the ARPANET. All this came together in September 1969 when BBN installed the first IMP at UCLA and the first host computer was connected. Doug Engelbart's project on "Augmentation of Human Intellect" (which included NLS, an early hypertext system) at Stanford Research Institute (SRI) provided a second node. SRI supported the Network Information Center, led by Elizabeth (Jake) Feinler and including functions such as maintaining tables of host name to address mapping as well as a directory of the RFC's.
- |
  One month later, when SRI was connected to the ARPANET, the first host-to-host message was sent from Kleinrock's laboratory to SRI. Two more nodes were added at UC Santa Barbara and University of Utah. These last two nodes incorporated application visualization projects, with Glen Culler and Burton Fried at UCSB investigating methods for display of mathematical functions using storage displays to deal with the problem of refresh over the net, and Robert Taylor and Ivan Sutherland at Utah investigating methods of 3-D representations over the net. Thus, by the end of 1969, four host computers were connected together into the initial ARPANET, and the budding Internet was off the ground. Even at this early stage, it should be noted that the networking research incorporated both work on the underlying network and work on how to utilize the network. This tradition continues to this day.
- |
  Computers were added quickly to the ARPANET during the following years, and work proceeded on completing a functionally complete Host-to-Host protocol and other network software. In December 1970 the Network Working Group (NWG) working under S. Crocker finished the initial ARPANET Host-to-Host protocol, called the Network Control Protocol (NCP). As the ARPANET sites completed implementing NCP during the period 1971-1972, the network users finally could begin to develop applications.
- |
  In October 1972, Kahn organized a large, very successful demonstration of the ARPANET at the International Computer Communication Conference (ICCC). This was the first public demonstration of this new network technology to the public. It was also in 1972 that the initial "hot" application, electronic mail, was introduced. In March Ray Tomlinson at BBN wrote the basic email message send and read software, motivated by the need of the ARPANET developers for an easy coordination mechanism. In July, Roberts expanded its utility by writing the first email utility program to list, selectively read, file, forward, and respond to messages. From there email took off as the largest network application for over a decade. This was a harbinger of the kind of activity we see on the World Wide Web today, namely, the enormous growth of all kinds of "people-to-people" traffic.

  The Initial Internetting Concepts
- |
  The original ARPANET grew into the Internet. Internet was based on the idea that there would be multiple independent networks of rather arbitrary design, beginning with the ARPANET as the pioneering packet switching network, but soon to include packet satellite networks, ground-based packet radio networks and other networks. The Internet as we now know it embodies a key underlying technical idea, namely that of open architecture networking. In this approach, the choice of any individual network technology was not dictated by a particular network architecture but rather could be selected freely by a provider and made to interwork with the other networks through a meta-level "Internetworking Architecture". Up until that time there was only one general method for federating networks. This was the traditional circuit switching method where networks would interconnect at the circuit level, passing individual bits on a synchronous basis along a portion of an end-to-end circuit between a pair of end locations. Recall that Kleinrock had shown in 1961 that packet switching was a more efficient switching method. Along with packet switching, special purpose interconnection arrangements between networks were another possibility. While there were other limited ways to interconnect different networks, they required that one be used as a component of the other, rather than acting as a peer of the other in offering end-to-end service.
- |
  In an open-architecture network, the individual networks may be separately designed and developed and each may have its own unique interface which it may offer to users and/or other providers. including other Internet providers. Each network can be designed in accordance with the specific environment and user requirements of that network. There are generally no constraints on the types of network that can be included or on their geographic scope, although certain pragmatic considerations will dictate what makes sense to offer.
- |
  The idea of open-architecture networking was first introduced by Kahn shortly after having arrived at DARPA in 1972. This work was originally part of the packet radio program, but subsequently became a separate program in its own right. At the time, the program was called "Internetting". Key to making the packet radio system work was a reliable end-end protocol that could maintain effective communication in the face of jamming and other radio interference, or withstand intermittent blackout such as caused by being in a tunnel or blocked by the local terrain. Kahn first contemplated developing a protocol local only to the packet radio network, since that would avoid having to deal with the multitude of different operating systems, and continuing to use NCP.
- |
  However, NCP did not have the ability to address networks (and machines) further downstream than a destination IMP on the ARPANET and thus some change to NCP would also be required. (The assumption was that the ARPANET was not changeable in this regard). NCP relied on ARPANET to provide end-to-end reliability. If any packets were lost, the protocol (and presumably any applications it supported) would come to a grinding halt. In this model NCP had no end-end host error control, since the ARPANET was to be the only network in existence and it would be so reliable that no error control would be required on the part of the hosts. Thus, Kahn decided to develop a new version of the protocol which could meet the needs of an open-architecture network environment. This protocol would eventually be called the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). While NCP tended to act like a device driver, the new protocol would be more like a communications protocol.
- |
  Four ground rules were critical to Kahn's early thinking:
- |
  Each distinct network would have to stand on its own and no internal changes could be required to any such network to connect it to the Internet.
- |
  Communications would be on a best effort basis. If a packet didn't make it to the final destination, it would shortly be retransmitted from the source.
- |
  Black boxes would be used to connect the networks; these would later be called gateways and routers. There would be no information retained by the gateways about the individual flows of packets passing through them, thereby keeping them simple and avoiding complicated adaptation and recovery from various failure modes.
- |
  There would be no global control at the operations level.
- |
  Other key issues that needed to be addressed were:
- |
  Algorithms to prevent lost packets from permanently disabling communications and enabling them to be successfully retransmitted from the source.
- |
  Providing for host-to-host "pipelining" so that multiple packets could be enroute from source to destination at the discretion of the participating hosts, if the intermediate networks allowed it.
- |
  Gateway functions to allow it to forward packets appropriately. This included interpreting IP headers for routing, handling interfaces, breaking packets into smaller pieces if necessary, etc.
- |
  The need for end-end checksums, reassembly of packets from fragments and detection of duplicates, if any.
- |
  The need for global addressing
- |
  Techniques for host-to-host flow control.
- |
  Interfacing with the various operating systems
- |
  There were also other concerns, such as implementation efficiency, internetwork performance, but these were secondary considerations at first.
- |
  Kahn began work on a communications-oriented set of operating system principles while at BBN and documented some of his early thoughts in an internal BBN memorandum entitled "Communications Principles for Operating Systems". At this point he realized it would be necessary to learn the implementation details of each operating system to have a chance to embed any new protocols in an efficient way. Thus, in the spring of 1973, after starting the internetting effort, he asked Vint Cerf (then at Stanford) to work with him on the detailed design of the protocol. Cerf had been intimately involved in the original NCP design and development and already had the knowledge about interfacing to existing operating systems. So armed with Kahn's architectural approach to the communications side and with Cerf's NCP experience, they teamed up to spell out the details of what became TCP/IP.
- |
  The give and take was highly productive and the first written version7 of the resulting approach was distributed at a special meeting of the International Network Working Group (INWG) which had been set up at a conference at Sussex University in September 1973. Cerf had been invited to chair this group and used the occasion to hold a meeting of INWG members who were heavily represented at the Sussex Conference.
- |
  Some basic approaches emerged from this collaboration between Kahn and Cerf:
- |
  Communication between two processes would logically consist of a very long stream of bytes (they called them octets). The position of any octet in the stream would be used to identify it.
- |
  Flow control would be done by using sliding windows and acknowledgments (acks). The destination could select when to acknowledge and each ack returned would be cumulative for all packets received to that point.
- |
  It was left open as to exactly how the source and destination would agree on the parameters of the windowing to be used. Defaults were used initially.
- |
  Although Ethernet was under development at Xerox PARC at that time, the proliferation of LANs were not envisioned at the time, much less PCs and workstations. The original model was national level networks like ARPANET of which only a relatively small number were expected to exist. Thus a 32 bit IP address was used of which the first 8 bits signified the network and the remaining 24 bits designated the host on that network. This assumption, that 256 networks would be sufficient for the foreseeable future, was clearly in need of reconsideration when LANs began to appear in the late 1970s.
- |
  The original Cerf/Kahn paper on the Internet described one protocol, called TCP, which provided all the transport and forwarding services in the Internet. Kahn had intended that the TCP protocol support a range of transport services, from the totally reliable sequenced delivery of data (virtual circuit model) to a datagram service in which the application made direct use of the underlying network service, which might imply occasional lost, corrupted or reordered packets. However, the initial effort to implement TCP resulted in a version that only allowed for virtual circuits. This model worked fine for file transfer and remote login applications, but some of the early work on advanced network applications, in particular packet voice in the 1970s, made clear that in some cases packet losses should not be corrected by TCP, but should be left to the application to deal with. This led to a reorganization of the original TCP into two protocols, the simple IP which provided only for addressing and forwarding of individual packets, and the separate TCP, which was concerned with service features such as flow control and recovery from lost packets. For those applications that did not want the services of TCP, an alternative called the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) was added in order to provide direct access to the basic service of IP.
- |
  A major initial motivation for both the ARPANET and the Internet was resource sharing - for example allowing users on the packet radio networks to access the time sharing systems attached to the ARPANET. Connecting the two together was far more economical that duplicating these very expensive computers. However, while file transfer and remote login (Telnet) were very important applications, electronic mail has probably had the most significant impact of the innovations from that era. Email provided a new model of how people could communicate with each other, and changed the nature of collaboration, first in the building of the Internet itself (as is discussed below) and later for much of society.
- |
  There were other applications proposed in the early days of the Internet, including packet based voice communication (the precursor of Internet telephony), various models of file and disk sharing, and early "worm" programs that showed the concept of agents (and, of course, viruses). A key concept of the Internet is that it was not designed for just one application, but as a general infrastructure on which new applications could be conceived, as illustrated later by the emergence of the World Wide Web. It is the general purpose nature of the service provided by TCP and IP that makes this possible.
- |
  Proving the Ideas
- |
  DARPA let three contracts to Stanford (Cerf), BBN (Ray Tomlinson) and UCL (Peter Kirstein) to implement TCP/IP (it was simply called TCP in the Cerf/Kahn paper but contained both components). The Stanford team, led by Cerf, produced the detailed specification and within about a year there were three independent implementations of TCP that could interoperate.
- |
  This was the beginning of long term experimentation and development to evolve and mature the Internet concepts and technology. Beginning with the first three networks (ARPANET, Packet Radio, and Packet Satellite) and their initial research communities, the experimental environment has grown to incorporate essentially every form of network and a very broad-based research and development community. [REK78] With each expansion has come new challenges.
- |
  The early implementations of TCP were done for large time sharing systems such as Tenex and TOPS 20. When desktop computers first appeared, it was thought by some that TCP was too big and complex to run on a personal computer. David Clark and his research group at MIT set out to show that a compact and simple implementation of TCP was possible. They produced an implementation, first for the Xerox Alto (the early personal workstation developed at Xerox PARC) and then for the IBM PC. That implementation was fully interoperable with other TCPs, but was tailored to the application suite and performance objectives of the personal computer, and showed that workstations, as well as large time-sharing systems, could be a part of the Internet. In 1976, Kleinrock published the first book on the ARPANET. It included an emphasis on the complexity of protocols and the pitfalls they often introduce. This book was influential in spreading the lore of packet switching networks to a very wide community.
- |
  Widespread development of LANS, PCs and workstations in the 1980s allowed the nascent Internet to flourish. Ethernet technology, developed by Bob Metcalfe at Xerox PARC in 1973, is now probably the dominant network technology in the Internet and PCs and workstations the dominant computers. This change from having a few networks with a modest number of time-shared hosts (the original ARPANET model) to having many networks has resulted in a number of new concepts and changes to the underlying technology. First, it resulted in the definition of three network classes (A, B, and C) to accommodate the range of networks. Class A represented large national scale networks (small number of networks with large numbers of hosts); Class B represented regional scale networks; and Class C represented local area networks (large number of networks with relatively few hosts).
- |
  A major shift occurred as a result of the increase in scale of the Internet and its associated management issues. To make it easy for people to use the network, hosts were assigned names, so that it was not necessary to remember the numeric addresses. Originally, there were a fairly limited number of hosts, so it was feasible to maintain a single table of all the hosts and their associated names and addresses. The shift to having a large number of independently managed networks (e.g., LANs) meant that having a single table of hosts was no longer feasible, and the Domain Name System (DNS) was invented by Paul Mockapetris of USC/ISI. The DNS permitted a scalable distributed mechanism for resolving hierarchical host names (e.g. www.acm.org) into an Internet address.
- |
  The increase in the size of the Internet also challenged the capabilities of the routers. Originally, there was a single distributed algorithm for routing that was implemented uniformly by all the routers in the Internet. As the number of networks in the Internet exploded, this initial design could not expand as necessary, so it was replaced by a hierarchical model of routing, with an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) used inside each region of the Internet, and an Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) used to tie the regions together. This design permitted different regions to use a different IGP, so that different requirements for cost, rapid reconfiguration, robustness and scale could be accommodated. Not only the routing algorithm, but the size of the addressing tables, stressed the capacity of the routers. New approaches for address aggregation, in particular classless inter-domain routing (CIDR), have recently been introduced to control the size of router tables.
- |
  As the Internet evolved, one of the major challenges was how to propagate the changes to the software, particularly the host software. DARPA supported UC Berkeley to investigate modifications to the Unix operating system, including incorporating TCP/IP developed at BBN. Although Berkeley later rewrote the BBN code to more efficiently fit into the Unix system and kernel, the incorporation of TCP/IP into the Unix BSD system releases proved to be a critical element in dispersion of the protocols to the research community. Much of the CS research community began to use Unix BSD for their day-to-day computing environment. Looking back, the strategy of incorporating Internet protocols into a supported operating system for the research community was one of the key elements in the successful widespread adoption of the Internet.
- |
  One of the more interesting challenges was the transition of the ARPANET host protocol from NCP to TCP/IP as of January 1, 1983. This was a "flag-day" style transition, requiring all hosts to convert simultaneously or be left having to communicate via rather ad-hoc mechanisms. This transition was carefully planned within the community over several years before it actually took place and went surprisingly smoothly (but resulted in a distribution of buttons saying "I survived the TCP/IP transition").
- |
  TCP/IP was adopted as a defense standard three years earlier in 1980. This enabled defense to begin sharing in the DARPA Internet technology base and led directly to the eventual partitioning of the military and non- military communities. By 1983, ARPANET was being used by a significant number of defense R&D and operational organizations. The transition of ARPANET from NCP to TCP/IP permitted it to be split into a MILNET supporting operational requirements and an ARPANET supporting research needs.
- |
  Thus, by 1985, Internet was already well established as a technology supporting a broad community of researchers and developers, and was beginning to be used by other communities for daily computer communications. Electronic mail was being used broadly across several communities, often with different systems, but interconnection between different mail systems was demonstrating the utility of broad based electronic communications between people.
- |
  Transition to Widespread Infrastructure
- |
  At the same time that the Internet technology was being experimentally validated and widely used amongst a subset of computer science researchers, other networks and networking technologies were being pursued. The usefulness of computer networking - especially electronic mail - demonstrated by DARPA and Department of Defense contractors on the ARPANET was not lost on other communities and disciplines, so that by the mid-1970s computer networks had begun to spring up wherever funding could be found for the purpose. The U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) established MFENet for its researchers in Magnetic Fusion Energy, whereupon DoE's High Energy Physicists responded by building HEPNet. NASA Space Physicists followed with SPAN, and Rick Adrion, David Farber, and Larry Landweber established CSNET for the (academic and industrial) Computer Science community with an initial grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF). AT&T's free-wheeling dissemination of the UNIX computer operating system spawned USENET, based on UNIX' built-in UUCP communication protocols, and in 1981 Ira Fuchs and Greydon Freeman devised BITNET, which linked academic mainframe computers in an "email as card images" paradigm.
- |
  With the exception of BITNET and USENET, these early networks (including ARPANET) were purpose-built - i.e., they were intended for, and largely restricted to, closed communities of scholars; there was hence little pressure for the individual networks to be compatible and, indeed, they largely were not. In addition, alternate technologies were being pursued in the commercial sector, including XNS from Xerox, DECNet, and IBM's SNA.8 It remained for the British JANET (1984) and U.S. NSFNET (1985) programs to explicitly announce their intent to serve the entire higher education community, regardless of discipline. Indeed, a condition for a U.S. university to receive NSF funding for an Internet connection was that "... the connection must be made available to ALL qualified users on campus."
- |
  In 1985, Dennis Jennings came from Ireland to spend a year at NSF leading the NSFNET program. He worked with the community to help NSF make a critical decision - that TCP/IP would be mandatory for the NSFNET program. When Steve Wolff took over the NSFNET program in 1986, he recognized the need for a wide area networking infrastructure to support the general academic and research community, along with the need to develop a strategy for establishing such infrastructure on a basis ultimately independent of direct federal funding. Policies and strategies were adopted (see below) to achieve that end.
- |
  NSF also elected to support DARPA's existing Internet organizational infrastructure, hierarchically arranged under the (then) Internet Activities Board (IAB). The public declaration of this choice was the joint authorship by the IAB's Internet Engineering and Architecture Task Forces and by NSF's Network Technical Advisory Group of RFC 985 (Requirements for Internet Gateways ), which formally ensured interoperability of DARPA's and NSF's pieces of the Internet.
- |
  In addition to the selection of TCP/IP for the NSFNET program, Federal agencies made and implemented several other policy decisions which shaped the Internet of today.
- |
  Federal agencies shared the cost of common infrastructure, such as trans-oceanic circuits. They also jointly supported "managed interconnection points" for interagency traffic; the Federal Internet Exchanges (FIX-E and FIX-W) built for this purpose served as models for the Network Access Points and "*IX" facilities that are prominent features of today's Internet architecture.
- |
  To coordinate this sharing, the Federal Networking Council9 was formed. The FNC also cooperated with other international organizations, such as RARE in Europe, through the Coordinating Committee on Intercontinental Research Networking, CCIRN, to coordinate Internet support of the research community worldwide.
- |
  This sharing and cooperation between agencies on Internet-related issues had a long history. An unprecedented 1981 agreement between Farber, acting for CSNET and the NSF, and DARPA's Kahn, permitted CSNET traffic to share ARPANET infrastructure on a statistical and no-metered-settlements basis.
- |
  Subsequently, in a similar mode, the NSF encouraged its regional (initially academic) networks of the NSFNET to seek commercial, non-academic customers, expand their facilities to serve them, and exploit the resulting economies of scale to lower subscription costs for all.
- |
  On the NSFNET Backbone - the national-scale segment of the NSFNET - NSF enforced an "Acceptable Use Policy" (AUP) which prohibited Backbone usage for purposes "not in support of Research and Education." The predictable (and intended) result of encouraging commercial network traffic at the local and regional level, while denying its access to national-scale transport, was to stimulate the emergence and/or growth of "private", competitive, long-haul networks such as PSI, UUNET, ANS CO+RE, and (later) others. This process of privately-financed augmentation for commercial uses was thrashed out starting in 1988 in a series of NSF-initiated conferences at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government on "The Commercialization and Privatization of the Internet" - and on the "com-priv" list on the net itself.
- |
  In 1988, a National Research Council committee, chaired by Kleinrock and with Kahn and Clark as members, produced a report commissioned by NSF titled "Towards a National Research Network". This report was influential on then Senator Al Gore, and ushered in high speed networks that laid the networking foundation for the future information superhighway.
- |
  In 1994, a National Research Council report, again chaired by Kleinrock (and with Kahn and Clark as members again), Entitled "Realizing The Information Future: The Internet and Beyond" was released. This report, commissioned by NSF, was the document in which a blueprint for the evolution of the information superhighway was articulated and which has had a lasting affect on the way to think about its evolution. It anticipated the critical issues of intellectual property rights, ethics, pricing, education, architecture and regulation for the Internet.
- |
  NSF's privatization policy culminated in April, 1995, with the defunding of the NSFNET Backbone. The funds thereby recovered were (competitively) redistributed to regional networks to buy national-scale Internet connectivity from the now numerous, private, long-haul networks.
- |
  The backbone had made the transition from a network built from routers out of the research community (the "Fuzzball" routers from David Mills) to commercial equipment. In its 8 1/2 year lifetime, the Backbone had grown from six nodes with 56 kbps links to 21 nodes with multiple 45 Mbps links. It had seen the Internet grow to over 50,000 networks on all seven continents and outer space, with approximately 29,000 networks in the United States.
- |
  Such was the weight of the NSFNET program's ecumenism and funding ($200 million from 1986 to 1995) - and the quality of the protocols themselves - that by 1990 when the ARPANET itself was finally decommissioned10, TCP/IP had supplanted or marginalized most other wide-area computer network protocols worldwide, and IP was well on its way to becoming THE bearer service for the Global Information Infrastructure.
- |
  The Role of Documentation
- |
  A key to the rapid growth of the Internet has been the free and open access to the basic documents, especially the specifications of the protocols.
- |
  The beginnings of the ARPANET and the Internet in the university research community promoted the academic tradition of open publication of ideas and results. However, the normal cycle of traditional academic publication was too formal and too slow for the dynamic exchange of ideas essential to creating networks.
- |
  In 1969 a key step was taken by S. Crocker (then at UCLA) in establishing the Request for Comments (or RFC) series of notes. These memos were intended to be an informal fast distribution way to share ideas with other network researchers. At first the RFCs were printed on paper and distributed via snail mail. As the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) came into use, the RFCs were prepared as online files and accessed via FTP. Now, of course, the RFCs are easily accessed via the World Wide Web at dozens of sites around the world. SRI, in its role as Network Information Center, maintained the online directories. Jon Postel acted as RFC Editor as well as managing the centralized administration of required protocol number assignments, roles that he continued to play until his death, October 16, 1998.
- |
  The effect of the RFCs was to create a positive feedback loop, with ideas or proposals presented in one RFC triggering another RFC with additional ideas, and so on. When some consensus (or a least a consistent set of ideas) had come together a specification document would be prepared. Such a specification would then be used as the base for implementations by the various research teams.
- |
  Over time, the RFCs have become more focused on protocol standards (the "official" specifications), though there are still informational RFCs that describe alternate approaches, or provide background information on protocols and engineering issues. The RFCs are now viewed as the "documents of record" in the Internet engineering and standards community.
- |
  The open access to the RFCs (for free, if you have any kind of a connection to the Internet) promotes the growth of the Internet because it allows the actual specifications to be used for examples in college classes and by entrepreneurs developing new systems.
- |
  Email has been a significant factor in all areas of the Internet, and that is certainly true in the development of protocol specifications, technical standards, and Internet engineering. The very early RFCs often presented a set of ideas developed by the researchers at one location to the rest of the community. After email came into use, the authorship pattern changed - RFCs were presented by joint authors with common view independent of their locations.
- |
  The use of specialized email mailing lists has been long used in the development of protocol specifications, and continues to be an important tool. The IETF now has in excess of 75 working groups, each working on a different aspect of Internet engineering. Each of these working groups has a mailing list to discuss one or more draft documents under development. When consensus is reached on a draft document it may be distributed as an RFC.
- |
  As the current rapid expansion of the Internet is fueled by the realization of its capability to promote information sharing, we should understand that the network's first role in information sharing was sharing the information about its own design and operation through the RFC documents. This unique method for evolving new capabilities in the network will continue to be critical to future evolution of the Internet.
- |
  Formation of the Broad Community
- |
  The Internet is as much a collection of communities as a collection of technologies, and its success is largely attributable to both satisfying basic community needs as well as utilizing the community in an effective way to push the infrastructure forward. This community spirit has a long history beginning with the early ARPANET. The early ARPANET researchers worked as a close-knit community to accomplish the initial demonstrations of packet switching technology described earlier. Likewise, the Packet Satellite, Packet Radio and several other DARPA computer science research programs were multi-contractor collaborative activities that heavily used whatever available mechanisms there were to coordinate their efforts, starting with electronic mail and adding file sharing, remote access, and eventually World Wide Web capabilities. Each of these programs formed a working group, starting with the ARPANET Network Working Group. Because of the unique role that ARPANET played as an infrastructure supporting the various research programs, as the Internet started to evolve, the Network Working Group evolved into Internet Working Group.
- |
  In the late 1970s, recognizing that the growth of the Internet was accompanied by a growth in the size of the interested research community and therefore an increased need for coordination mechanisms, Vint Cerf, then manager of the Internet Program at DARPA, formed several coordination bodies - an International Cooperation Board (ICB), chaired by Peter Kirstein of UCL, to coordinate activities with some cooperating European countries centered on Packet Satellite research, an Internet Research Group which was an inclusive group providing an environment for general exchange of information, and an Internet Configuration Control Board (ICCB), chaired by Clark. The ICCB was an invitational body to assist Cerf in managing the burgeoning Internet activity.
- |
  In 1983, when Barry Leiner took over management of the Internet research program at DARPA, he and Clark recognized that the continuing growth of the Internet community demanded a restructuring of the coordination mechanisms. The ICCB was disbanded and in its place a structure of Task Forces was formed, each focused on a particular area of the technology (e.g. routers, end-to-end protocols, etc.). The Internet Activities Board (IAB) was formed from the chairs of the Task Forces.
- |
  It of course was only a coincidence that the chairs of the Task Forces were the same people as the members of the old ICCB, and Dave Clark continued to act as chair. After some changing membership on the IAB, Phill Gross became chair of a revitalized Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), at the time merely one of the IAB Task Forces. As we saw above, by 1985 there was a tremendous growth in the more practical/engineering side of the Internet. This growth resulted in an explosion in the attendance at the IETF meetings, and Gross was compelled to create substructure to the IETF in the form of working groups.
- |
  This growth was complemented by a major expansion in the community. No longer was DARPA the only major player in the funding of the Internet. In addition to NSFNet and the various US and international government-funded activities, interest in the commercial sector was beginning to grow. Also in 1985, both Kahn and Leiner left DARPA and there was a significant decrease in Internet activity at DARPA. As a result, the IAB was left without a primary sponsor and increasingly assumed the mantle of leadership.
- |
  The growth continued, resulting in even further substructure within both the IAB and IETF. The IETF combined Working Groups into Areas, and designated Area Directors. An Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) was formed of the Area Directors. The IAB recognized the increasing importance of the IETF, and restructured the standards process to explicitly recognize the IESG as the major review body for standards. The IAB also restructured so that the rest of the Task Forces (other than the IETF) were combined into an Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) chaired by Postel, with the old task forces renamed as research groups.
- |
  The growth in the commercial sector brought with it increased concern regarding the standards process itself. Starting in the early 1980's and continuing to this day, the Internet grew beyond its primarily research roots to include both a broad user community and increased commercial activity. Increased attention was paid to making the process open and fair. This coupled with a recognized need for community support of the Internet eventually led to the formation of the Internet Society in 1991, under the auspices of Kahn's Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) and the leadership of Cerf, then with CNRI.
- |
  In 1992, yet another reorganization took place. In 1992, the Internet Activities Board was re-organized and re-named the Internet Architecture Board operating under the auspices of the Internet Society. A more "peer" relationship was defined between the new IAB and IESG, with the IETF and IESG taking a larger responsibility for the approval of standards. Ultimately, a cooperative and mutually supportive relationship was formed between the IAB, IETF, and Internet Society, with the Internet Society taking on as a goal the provision of service and other measures which would facilitate the work of the IETF.
- |
  The recent development and widespread deployment of the World Wide Web has brought with it a new community, as many of the people working on the WWW have not thought of themselves as primarily network researchers and developers. A new coordination organization was formed, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Initially led from MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science by Tim Berners-Lee (the inventor of the WWW) and Al Vezza, W3C has taken on the responsibility for evolving the various protocols and standards associated with the Web.
- |
  Thus, through the over two decades of Internet activity, we have seen a steady evolution of organizational structures designed to support and facilitate an ever-increasing community working collaboratively on Internet issues.
- |
  Commercialization of the Technology
- |
  Commercialization of the Internet involved not only the development of competitive, private network services, but also the development of commercial products implementing the Internet technology. In the early 1980s, dozens of vendors were incorporating TCP/IP into their products because they saw buyers for that approach to networking. Unfortunately they lacked both real information about how the technology was supposed to work and how the customers planned on using this approach to networking. Many saw it as a nuisance add-on that had to be glued on to their own proprietary networking solutions: SNA, DECNet, Netware, NetBios. The DoD had mandated the use of TCP/IP in many of its purchases but gave little help to the vendors regarding how to build useful TCP/IP products.
- |
  In 1985, recognizing this lack of information availability and appropriate training, Dan Lynch in cooperation with the IAB arranged to hold a three day workshop for ALL vendors to come learn about how TCP/IP worked and what it still could not do well. The speakers came mostly from the DARPA research community who had both developed these protocols and used them in day-to-day work. About 250 vendor personnel came to listen to 50 inventors and experimenters. The results were surprises on both sides: the vendors were amazed to find that the inventors were so open about the way things worked (and what still did not work) and the inventors were pleased to listen to new problems they had not considered, but were being discovered by the vendors in the field. Thus a two-way discussion was formed that has lasted for over a decade.
- |
  After two years of conferences, tutorials, design meetings and workshops, a special event was organized that invited those vendors whose products ran TCP/IP well enough to come together in one room for three days to show off how well they all worked together and also ran over the Internet. In September of 1988 the first Interop trade show was born. 50 companies made the cut. 5,000 engineers from potential customer organizations came to see if it all did work as was promised. It did. Why? Because the vendors worked extremely hard to ensure that everyone's products interoperated with all of the other products - even with those of their competitors. The Interop trade show has grown immensely since then and today it is held in 7 locations around the world each year to an audience of over 250,000 people who come to learn which products work with each other in a seamless manner, learn about the latest products, and discuss the latest technology.
- |
  In parallel with the commercialization efforts that were highlighted by the Interop activities, the vendors began to attend the IETF meetings that were held 3 or 4 times a year to discuss new ideas for extensions of the TCP/IP protocol suite. Starting with a few hundred attendees mostly from academia and paid for by the government, these meetings now often exceed a thousand attendees, mostly from the vendor community and paid for by the attendees themselves. This self-selected group evolves the TCP/IP suite in a mutually cooperative manner. The reason it is so useful is that it is composed of all stakeholders: researchers, end users and vendors.
- |
  Network management provides an example of the interplay between the research and commercial communities. In the beginning of the Internet, the emphasis was on defining and implementing protocols that achieved interoperation.
- |
  As the network grew larger, it became clear that the sometime ad hoc procedures used to manage the network would not scale. Manual configuration of tables was replaced by distributed automated algorithms, and better tools were devised to isolate faults. In 1987 it became clear that a protocol was needed that would permit the elements of the network, such as the routers, to be remotely managed in a uniform way. Several protocols for this purpose were proposed, including Simple Network Management Protocol or SNMP (designed, as its name would suggest, for simplicity, and derived from an earlier proposal called SGMP) , HEMS (a more complex design from the research community) and CMIP (from the OSI community). A series of meeting led to the decisions that HEMS would be withdrawn as a candidate for standardization, in order to help resolve the contention, but that work on both SNMP and CMIP would go forward, with the idea that the SNMP could be a more near-term solution and CMIP a longer-term approach. The market could choose the one it found more suitable. SNMP is now used almost universally for network-based management.
- |
  In the last few years, we have seen a new phase of commercialization. Originally, commercial efforts mainly comprised vendors providing the basic networking products, and service providers offering the connectivity and basic Internet services. The Internet has now become almost a "commodity" service, and much of the latest attention has been on the use of this global information infrastructure for support of other commercial services. This has been tremendously accelerated by the widespread and rapid adoption of browsers and the World Wide Web technology, allowing users easy access to information linked throughout the globe. Products are available to facilitate the provisioning of that information and many of the latest developments in technology have been aimed at providing increasingly sophisticated information services on top of the basic Internet data communications.

  History of the Future
- |
  On October 24, 1995, the FNC unanimously passed a resolution defining the term Internet. This definition was developed in consultation with members of the internet and intellectual property rights communities. RESOLUTION: The Federal Networking Council (FNC) agrees that the following language reflects our definition of the term "Internet". "Internet" refers to the global information system that -- (i) is logically linked together by a globally unique address space based on the Internet Protocol (IP) or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons; (ii) is able to support communications using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons, and/or other IP-compatible protocols; and (iii) provides, uses or makes accessible, either publicly or privately, high level services layered on the communications and related infrastructure described herein.
- |
  The Internet has changed much in the two decades since it came into existence. It was conceived in the era of time-sharing, but has survived into the era of personal computers, client-server and peer-to-peer computing, and the network computer. It was designed before LANs existed, but has accommodated that new network technology, as well as the more recent ATM and frame switched services. It was envisioned as supporting a range of functions from file sharing and remote login to resource sharing and collaboration, and has spawned electronic mail and more recently the World Wide Web. But most important, it started as the creation of a small band of dedicated researchers, and has grown to be a commercial success with billions of dollars of annual investment.
- |
  One should not conclude that the Internet has now finished changing. The Internet, although a network in name and geography, is a creature of the computer, not the traditional network of the telephone or television industry. It will, indeed it must, continue to change and evolve at the speed of the computer industry if it is to remain relevant. It is now changing to provide new services such as real time transport, in order to support, for example, audio and video streams.
- |
  The availability of pervasive networking (i.e., the Internet) along with powerful affordable computing and communications in portable form (i.e., laptop computers, two-way pagers, PDAs, cellular phones), is making possible a new paradigm of nomadic computing and communications. This evolution will bring us new applications - Internet telephone and, slightly further out, Internet television. It is evolving to permit more sophisticated forms of pricing and cost recovery, a perhaps painful requirement in this commercial world. It is changing to accommodate yet another generation of underlying network technologies with different characteristics and requirements, e.g. broadband residential access and satellites. New modes of access and new forms of service will spawn new applications, which in turn will drive further evolution of the net itself.
- |
  The most pressing question for the future of the Internet is not how the technology will change, but how the process of change and evolution itself will be managed. As this paper describes, the architecture of the Internet has always been driven by a core group of designers, but the form of that group has changed as the number of interested parties has grown. With the success of the Internet has come a proliferation of stakeholders - stakeholders now with an economic as well as an intellectual investment in the network.
- |
  We now see, in the debates over control of the domain name space and the form of the next generation IP addresses, a struggle to find the next social structure that will guide the Internet in the future. The form of that structure will be harder to find, given the large number of concerned stakeholders. At the same time, the industry struggles to find the economic rationale for the large investment needed for the future growth, for example to upgrade residential access to a more suitable technology. If the Internet stumbles, it will not be because we lack for technology, vision, or motivation. It will be because we cannot set a direction and march collectively into the future.

  1 Perhaps this is an exaggeration based on the lead author's residence in Silicon Valley.2 On a recent trip to a Tokyo bookstore, one of the authors counted 14 English language magazines devoted to the Internet.3 An abbreviated version of this article appears in the 50th anniversary issue of the CACM, Feb. 97. The authors would like to express their appreciation to Andy Rosenbloom, CACM Senior Editor, for both instigating the writing of this article and his invaluable assistance in editing both this and the abbreviated version.4 The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) changed its name to Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1971, then back to ARPA in 1993, and back to DARPA in 1996. We refer throughout to DARPA, the current name.5 It was from the RAND study that the false rumor started claiming that the ARPANET was somehow related to building a network resistant to nuclear war. This was never true of the ARPANET, only the unrelated RAND study on secure voice considered nuclear war. However, the later work on Internetting did emphasize robustness and survivability, including the capability to withstand losses of large portions of the underlying networks.6 Including amongst others Vint Cerf, Steve Crocker, and Jon Postel. Joining them later were David Crocker who was to play an important role in documentation of electronic mail protocols, and Robert Braden, who developed the first NCP and then TCP for IBM mainframes and also was to play a long term role in the ICCB and IAB.7 This was subsequently published as V. G. Cerf and R. E. Kahn, "A protocol for packet network interconnection" IEEE Trans. Comm. Tech., vol. COM-22, V 5, pp. 627-641, May 1974.8 The desirability of email interchange, however, led to one of the first "Internet books": !%@:: A Directory of Electronic Mail Addressing and Networks, by Frey and Adams, on email address translation and forwarding.9 Originally named Federal Research Internet Coordinating Committee, FRICC. The FRICC was originally formed to coordinate U.S. research network activities in support of the international coordination provided by the CCIRN.10 The decommissioning of the ARPANET was commemorated on its 20th anniversary by a UCLA symposium in 1989.

- ' Barry M. Leiner, Vinton G. Cerf, David D. Clark, Robert E. Kahn, Leonard Kleinrock,
  Daniel C. Lynch, Jon Postel, Larry G. Roberts, Stephen WolffThe Internet has revolutionized
  the computer and communications world like nothing before. The invention of the
  telegraph, telephone, radio, and computer set the stage for this unprecedented integration
  of capabilities. The Internet is at once a world-wide broadcasting capability, a
  mechanism for information dissemination, and a medium for collaboration and interaction
  between individuals and their computers without regard for geographic location.
  The Internet represents one of the most successful examples of the benefits of sustained
  investment and commitment to research and development of information infrastructure.
  Beginning with the early research in packet switching, the government, industry
  and academia have been partners in evolving and deploying this exciting new technology.
  Today, terms like "bleiner@computer.org" and "http://www.acm.org" trip lightly off
  the tongue of the random person on the street. 1This is intended to be a brief,
  necessarily cursory and incomplete history. Much material currently exists about
  the Internet, covering history, technology, and usage. A trip to almost any bookstore
  will find shelves of material written about the Internet. 2In this paper,3 several
  of us involved in the development and evolution of the Internet share our views
  of its origins and history. This history revolves around four distinct aspects.
  There is the technological evolution that began with early research on packet switching
  and the ARPANET (and related technologies), and where current research continues
  to expand the horizons of the infrastructure along several dimensions, such as scale,
  performance, and higher-level functionality. There is the operations and management
  aspect of a global and complex operational infrastructure. There is the social aspect,
  which resulted in a broad community of Internauts working together to create and
  evolve the technology. And there is the commercialization aspect, resulting in an
  extremely effective transition of research results into a broadly deployed and available
  information infrastructure.The Internet today is a widespread information infrastructure,
  the initial prototype of what is often called the National (or Global or Galactic)
  Information Infrastructure. Its history is complex and involves many aspects - technological,
  organizational, and community. And its influence reaches not only to the technical
  fields of computer communications but throughout society as we move toward increasing
  use of online tools to accomplish electronic commerce, information acquisition,
  and community operations.The first recorded description of the social interactions
  that could be enabled through networking was a series of memos written by J.C.R.
  Licklider of MIT in August 1962 discussing his "Galactic Network" concept. He envisioned
  a globally interconnected set of computers through which everyone could quickly
  access data and programs from any site. In spirit, the concept was very much like
  the Internet of today. Licklider was the first head of the computer research program
  at DARPA,4 starting in October 1962. While at DARPA he convinced his successors
  at DARPA, Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and MIT researcher Lawrence G. Roberts, of
  the importance of this networking concept.Leonard Kleinrock at MIT published the
  first paper on packet switching theory in July 1961 and the first book on the subject
  in 1964. Kleinrock convinced Roberts of the theoretical feasibility of communications
  using packets rather than circuits, which was a major step along the path towards
  computer networking. The other key step was to make the computers talk together.
  To explore this, in 1965 working with Thomas Merrill, Roberts connected the TX-2
  computer in Mass. to the Q-32 in California with a low speed dial-up telephone line
  creating the first (however small) wide-area computer network ever built. The result
  of this experiment was the realization that the time-shared computers could work
  well together, running programs and retrieving data as necessary on the remote machine,
  but that the circuit switched telephone system was totally inadequate for the job.
  Kleinrock''s conviction of the need for packet switching was confirmed.In late 1966
  Roberts went to DARPA to develop the computer network concept and quickly put together
  his plan for the "ARPANET", publishing it in 1967. At the conference where he presented
  the paper, there was also a paper on a packet network concept from the UK by Donald
  Davies and Roger Scantlebury of NPL. Scantlebury told Roberts about the NPL work
  as well as that of Paul Baran and others at RAND. The RAND group had written a paper
  on packet switching networks for secure voice in the military in 1964. It happened
  that the work at MIT (1961-1967), at RAND (1962-1965), and at NPL (1964-1967) had
  all proceeded in parallel without any of the researchers knowing about the other
  work. The word "packet" was adopted from the work at NPL and the proposed line speed
  to be used in the ARPANET design was upgraded from 2.4 kbps to 50 kbps. 5In August
  1968, after Roberts and the DARPA funded community had refined the overall structure
  and specifications for the ARPANET, an RFQ was released by DARPA for the development
  of one of the key components, the packet switches called Interface Message Processors
  (IMP''s). The RFQ was won in December 1968 by a group headed by Frank Heart at Bolt
  Beranek and Newman (BBN). As the BBN team worked on the IMP''s with Bob Kahn playing
  a major role in the overall ARPANET architectural design, the network topology and
  economics were designed and optimized by Roberts working with Howard Frank and his
  team at Network Analysis Corporation, and the network measurement system was prepared
  by Kleinrock''s team at UCLA. 6Due to Kleinrock''s early development of packet switching
  theory and his focus on analysis, design and measurement, his Network Measurement
  Center at UCLA was selected to be the first node on the ARPANET. All this came together
  in September 1969 when BBN installed the first IMP at UCLA and the first host computer
  was connected. Doug Engelbart''s project on "Augmentation of Human Intellect" (which
  included NLS, an early hypertext system) at Stanford Research Institute (SRI) provided
  a second node. SRI supported the Network Information Center, led by Elizabeth (Jake)
  Feinler and including functions such as maintaining tables of host name to address
  mapping as well as a directory of the RFC''s.One month later, when SRI was connected
  to the ARPANET, the first host-to-host message was sent from Kleinrock''s laboratory
  to SRI. Two more nodes were added at UC Santa Barbara and University of Utah. These
  last two nodes incorporated application visualization projects, with Glen Culler
  and Burton Fried at UCSB investigating methods for display of mathematical functions
  using storage displays to deal with the problem of refresh over the net, and Robert
  Taylor and Ivan Sutherland at Utah investigating methods of 3-D representations
  over the net. Thus, by the end of 1969, four host computers were connected together
  into the initial ARPANET, and the budding Internet was off the ground. Even at this
  early stage, it should be noted that the networking research incorporated both work
  on the underlying network and work on how to utilize the network. This tradition
  continues to this day.Computers were added quickly to the ARPANET during the following
  years, and work proceeded on completing a functionally complete Host-to-Host protocol
  and other network software. In December 1970 the Network Working Group (NWG) working
  under S. Crocker finished the initial ARPANET Host-to-Host protocol, called the
  Network Control Protocol (NCP). As the ARPANET sites completed implementing NCP
  during the period 1971-1972, the network users finally could begin to develop applications.In
  October 1972, Kahn organized a large, very successful demonstration of the ARPANET
  at the International Computer Communication Conference (ICCC). This was the first
  public demonstration of this new network technology to the public. It was also in
  1972 that the initial "hot" application, electronic mail, was introduced. In March
  Ray Tomlinson at BBN wrote the basic email message send and read software, motivated
  by the need of the ARPANET developers for an easy coordination mechanism. In July,
  Roberts expanded its utility by writing the first email utility program to list,
  selectively read, file, forward, and respond to messages. From there email took
  off as the largest network application for over a decade. This was a harbinger of
  the kind of activity we see on the World Wide Web today, namely, the enormous growth
  of all kinds of "people-to-people" traffic.The original ARPANET grew into the Internet.
  Internet was based on the idea that there would be multiple independent networks
  of rather arbitrary design, beginning with the ARPANET as the pioneering packet
  switching network, but soon to include packet satellite networks, ground-based packet
  radio networks and other networks. The Internet as we now know it embodies a key
  underlying technical idea, namely that of open architecture networking. In this
  approach, the choice of any individual network technology was not dictated by a
  particular network architecture but rather could be selected freely by a provider
  and made to interwork with the other networks through a meta-level "Internetworking
  Architecture". Up until that time there was only one general method for federating
  networks. This was the traditional circuit switching method where networks would
  interconnect at the circuit level, passing individual bits on a synchronous basis
  along a portion of an end-to-end circuit between a pair of end locations. Recall
  that Kleinrock had shown in 1961 that packet switching was a more efficient switching
  method. Along with packet switching, special purpose interconnection arrangements
  between networks were another possibility. While there were other limited ways to
  interconnect different networks, they required that one be used as a component of
  the other, rather than acting as a peer of the other in offering end-to-end service.In
  an open-architecture network, the individual networks may be separately designed
  and developed and each may have its own unique interface which it may offer to users
  and/or other providers. including other Internet providers. Each network can be
  designed in accordance with the specific environment and user requirements of that
  network. There are generally no constraints on the types of network that can be
  included or on their geographic scope, although certain pragmatic considerations
  will dictate what makes sense to offer.The idea of open-architecture networking
  was first introduced by Kahn shortly after having arrived at DARPA in 1972. This
  work was originally part of the packet radio program, but subsequently became a
  separate program in its own right. At the time, the program was called "Internetting".
  Key to making the packet radio system work was a reliable end-end protocol that
  could maintain effective communication in the face of jamming and other radio interference,
  or withstand intermittent blackout such as caused by being in a tunnel or blocked
  by the local terrain. Kahn first contemplated developing a protocol local only to
  the packet radio network, since that would avoid having to deal with the multitude
  of different operating systems, and continuing to use NCP.However, NCP did not have
  the ability to address networks (and machines) further downstream than a destination
  IMP on the ARPANET and thus some change to NCP would also be required. (The assumption
  was that the ARPANET was not changeable in this regard). NCP relied on ARPANET to
  provide end-to-end reliability. If any packets were lost, the protocol (and presumably
  any applications it supported) would come to a grinding halt. In this model NCP
  had no end-end host error control, since the ARPANET was to be the only network
  in existence and it would be so reliable that no error control would be required
  on the part of the hosts. Thus, Kahn decided to develop a new version of the protocol
  which could meet the needs of an open-architecture network environment. This protocol
  would eventually be called the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).
  While NCP tended to act like a device driver, the new protocol would be more like
  a communications protocol.Four ground rules were critical to Kahn''s early thinking:Other
  key issues that needed to be addressed were:Kahn began work on a communications-oriented
  set of operating system principles while at BBN and documented some of his early
  thoughts in an internal BBN memorandum entitled "Communications Principles for Operating
  Systems". At this point he realized it would be necessary to learn the implementation
  details of each operating system to have a chance to embed any new protocols in
  an efficient way. Thus, in the spring of 1973, after starting the internetting effort,
  he asked Vint Cerf (then at Stanford) to work with him on the detailed design of
  the protocol. Cerf had been intimately involved in the original NCP design and development
  and already had the knowledge about interfacing to existing operating systems. So
  armed with Kahn''s architectural approach to the communications side and with Cerf''s
  NCP experience, they teamed up to spell out the details of what became TCP/IP.The
  give and take was highly productive and the first written version7 of the resulting
  approach was distributed at a special meeting of the International Network Working
  Group (INWG) which had been set up at a conference at Sussex University in September
  1973. Cerf had been invited to chair this group and used the occasion to hold a
  meeting of INWG members who were heavily represented at the Sussex Conference.Some
  basic approaches emerged from this collaboration between Kahn and Cerf:The original
  Cerf/Kahn paper on the Internet described one protocol, called TCP, which provided
  all the transport and forwarding services in the Internet. Kahn had intended that
  the TCP protocol support a range of transport services, from the totally reliable
  sequenced delivery of data (virtual circuit model) to a datagram service in which
  the application made direct use of the underlying network service, which might imply
  occasional lost, corrupted or reordered packets. However, the initial effort to
  implement TCP resulted in a version that only allowed for virtual circuits. This
  model worked fine for file transfer and remote login applications, but some of the
  early work on advanced network applications, in particular packet voice in the 1970s,
  made clear that in some cases packet losses should not be corrected by TCP, but
  should be left to the application to deal with. This led to a reorganization of
  the original TCP into two protocols, the simple IP which provided only for addressing
  and forwarding of individual packets, and the separate TCP, which was concerned
  with service features such as flow control and recovery from lost packets. For those
  applications that did not want the services of TCP, an alternative called the User
  Datagram Protocol (UDP) was added in order to provide direct access to the basic
  service of IP.A major initial motivation for both the ARPANET and the Internet was
  resource sharing - for example allowing users on the packet radio networks to access
  the time sharing systems attached to the ARPANET. Connecting the two together was
  far more economical that duplicating these very expensive computers. However, while
  file transfer and remote login (Telnet) were very important applications, electronic
  mail has probably had the most significant impact of the innovations from that era.
  Email provided a new model of how people could communicate with each other, and
  changed the nature of collaboration, first in the building of the Internet itself
  (as is discussed below) and later for much of society.There were other applications
  proposed in the early days of the Internet, including packet based voice communication
  (the precursor of Internet telephony), various models of file and disk sharing,
  and early "worm" programs that showed the concept of agents (and, of course, viruses).
  A key concept of the Internet is that it was not designed for just one application,
  but as a general infrastructure on which new applications could be conceived, as
  illustrated later by the emergence of the World Wide Web. It is the general purpose
  nature of the service provided by TCP and IP that makes this possible.DARPA let
  three contracts to Stanford (Cerf), BBN (Ray Tomlinson) and UCL (Peter Kirstein)
  to implement TCP/IP (it was simply called TCP in the Cerf/Kahn paper but contained
  both components). The Stanford team, led by Cerf, produced the detailed specification
  and within about a year there were three independent implementations of TCP that
  could interoperate.This was the beginning of long term experimentation and development
  to evolve and mature the Internet concepts and technology. Beginning with the first
  three networks (ARPANET, Packet Radio, and Packet Satellite) and their initial research
  communities, the experimental environment has grown to incorporate essentially every
  form of network and a very broad-based research and development community. [REK78]
  With each expansion has come new challenges.The early implementations of TCP were
  done for large time sharing systems such as Tenex and TOPS 20. When desktop computers
  first appeared, it was thought by some that TCP was too big and complex to run on
  a personal computer. David Clark and his research group at MIT set out to show that
  a compact and simple implementation of TCP was possible. They produced an implementation,
  first for the Xerox Alto (the early personal workstation developed at Xerox PARC)
  and then for the IBM PC. That implementation was fully interoperable with other
  TCPs, but was tailored to the application suite and performance objectives of the
  personal computer, and showed that workstations, as well as large time-sharing systems,
  could be a part of the Internet. In 1976, Kleinrock published the first book on
  the ARPANET. It included an emphasis on the complexity of protocols and the pitfalls
  they often introduce. This book was influential in spreading the lore of packet
  switching networks to a very wide community.Widespread development of LANS, PCs
  and workstations in the 1980s allowed the nascent Internet to flourish. Ethernet
  technology, developed by Bob Metcalfe at Xerox PARC in 1973, is now probably the
  dominant network technology in the Internet and PCs and workstations the dominant
  computers. This change from having a few networks with a modest number of time-shared
  hosts (the original ARPANET model) to having many networks has resulted in a number
  of new concepts and changes to the underlying technology. First, it resulted in
  the definition of three network classes (A, B, and C) to accommodate the range of
  networks. Class A represented large national scale networks (small number of networks
  with large numbers of hosts); Class B represented regional scale networks; and Class
  C represented local area networks (large number of networks with relatively few
  hosts).A major shift occurred as a result of the increase in scale of the Internet
  and its associated management issues. To make it easy for people to use the network,
  hosts were assigned names, so that it was not necessary to remember the numeric
  addresses. Originally, there were a fairly limited number of hosts, so it was feasible
  to maintain a single table of all the hosts and their associated names and addresses.
  The shift to having a large number of independently managed networks (e.g., LANs)
  meant that having a single table of hosts was no longer feasible, and the Domain
  Name System (DNS) was invented by Paul Mockapetris of USC/ISI. The DNS permitted
  a scalable distributed mechanism for resolving hierarchical host names (e.g. www.acm.org)
  into an Internet address.The increase in the size of the Internet also challenged
  the capabilities of the routers. Originally, there was a single distributed algorithm
  for routing that was implemented uniformly by all the routers in the Internet. As
  the number of networks in the Internet exploded, this initial design could not expand
  as necessary, so it was replaced by a hierarchical model of routing, with an Interior
  Gateway Protocol (IGP) used inside each region of the Internet, and an Exterior
  Gateway Protocol (EGP) used to tie the regions together. This design permitted different
  regions to use a different IGP, so that different requirements for cost, rapid reconfiguration,
  robustness and scale could be accommodated. Not only the routing algorithm, but
  the size of the addressing tables, stressed the capacity of the routers. New approaches
  for address aggregation, in particular classless inter-domain routing (CIDR), have
  recently been introduced to control the size of router tables.As the Internet evolved,
  one of the major challenges was how to propagate the changes to the software, particularly
  the host software. DARPA supported UC Berkeley to investigate modifications to the
  Unix operating system, including incorporating TCP/IP developed at BBN. Although
  Berkeley later rewrote the BBN code to more efficiently fit into the Unix system
  and kernel, the incorporation of TCP/IP into the Unix BSD system releases proved
  to be a critical element in dispersion of the protocols to the research community.
  Much of the CS research community began to use Unix BSD for their day-to-day computing
  environment. Looking back, the strategy of incorporating Internet protocols into
  a supported operating system for the research community was one of the key elements
  in the successful widespread adoption of the Internet.One of the more interesting
  challenges was the transition of the ARPANET host protocol from NCP to TCP/IP as
  of January 1, 1983. This was a "flag-day" style transition, requiring all hosts
  to convert simultaneously or be left having to communicate via rather ad-hoc mechanisms.
  This transition was carefully planned within the community over several years before
  it actually took place and went surprisingly smoothly (but resulted in a distribution
  of buttons saying "I survived the TCP/IP transition").TCP/IP was adopted as a defense
  standard three years earlier in 1980. This enabled defense to begin sharing in the
  DARPA Internet technology base and led directly to the eventual partitioning of
  the military and non- military communities. By 1983, ARPANET was being used by a
  significant number of defense R&D and operational organizations. The transition
  of ARPANET from NCP to TCP/IP permitted it to be split into a MILNET supporting
  operational requirements and an ARPANET supporting research needs.Thus, by 1985,
  Internet was already well established as a technology supporting a broad community
  of researchers and developers, and was beginning to be used by other communities
  for daily computer communications. Electronic mail was being used broadly across
  several communities, often with different systems, but interconnection between different
  mail systems was demonstrating the utility of broad based electronic communications
  between people.At the same time that the Internet technology was being experimentally
  validated and widely used amongst a subset of computer science researchers, other
  networks and networking technologies were being pursued. The usefulness of computer
  networking - especially electronic mail - demonstrated by DARPA and Department of
  Defense contractors on the ARPANET was not lost on other communities and disciplines,
  so that by the mid-1970s computer networks had begun to spring up wherever funding
  could be found for the purpose. The U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) established
  MFENet for its researchers in Magnetic Fusion Energy, whereupon DoE''s High Energy
  Physicists responded by building HEPNet. NASA Space Physicists followed with SPAN,
  and Rick Adrion, David Farber, and Larry Landweber established CSNET for the (academic
  and industrial) Computer Science community with an initial grant from the U.S. National
  Science Foundation (NSF). AT&T''s free-wheeling dissemination of the UNIX computer
  operating system spawned USENET, based on UNIX'' built-in UUCP communication protocols,
  and in 1981 Ira Fuchs and Greydon Freeman devised BITNET, which linked academic
  mainframe computers in an "email as card images" paradigm.With the exception of
  BITNET and USENET, these early networks (including ARPANET) were purpose-built -
  i.e., they were intended for, and largely restricted to, closed communities of scholars;
  there was hence little pressure for the individual networks to be compatible and,
  indeed, they largely were not. In addition, alternate technologies were being pursued
  in the commercial sector, including XNS from Xerox, DECNet, and IBM''s SNA.8 It
  remained for the British JANET (1984) and U.S. NSFNET (1985) programs to explicitly
  announce their intent to serve the entire higher education community, regardless
  of discipline. Indeed, a condition for a U.S. university to receive NSF funding
  for an Internet connection was that "... the connection must be made available to
  ALL qualified users on campus."In 1985, Dennis Jennings came from Ireland to spend
  a year at NSF leading the NSFNET program. He worked with the community to help NSF
  make a critical decision - that TCP/IP would be mandatory for the NSFNET program.
  When Steve Wolff took over the NSFNET program in 1986, he recognized the need for
  a wide area networking infrastructure to support the general academic and research
  community, along with the need to develop a strategy for establishing such infrastructure
  on a basis ultimately independent of direct federal funding. Policies and strategies
  were adopted (see below) to achieve that end.NSF also elected to support DARPA''s
  existing Internet organizational infrastructure, hierarchically arranged under the
  (then) Internet Activities Board (IAB). The public declaration of this choice was
  the joint authorship by the IAB''s Internet Engineering and Architecture Task Forces
  and by NSF''s Network Technical Advisory Group of RFC 985 (Requirements for Internet
  Gateways ), which formally ensured interoperability of DARPA''s and NSF''s pieces
  of the Internet.In addition to the selection of TCP/IP for the NSFNET program, Federal
  agencies made and implemented several other policy decisions which shaped the Internet
  of today.The backbone had made the transition from a network built from routers
  out of the research community (the "Fuzzball" routers from David Mills) to commercial
  equipment. In its 8 1/2 year lifetime, the Backbone had grown from six nodes with
  56 kbps links to 21 nodes with multiple 45 Mbps links. It had seen the Internet
  grow to over 50,000 networks on all seven continents and outer space, with approximately
  29,000 networks in the United States.Such was the weight of the NSFNET program''s
  ecumenism and funding ($200 million from 1986 to 1995) - and the quality of the
  protocols themselves - that by 1990 when the ARPANET itself was finally decommissioned10,
  TCP/IP had supplanted or marginalized most other wide-area computer network protocols
  worldwide, and IP was well on its way to becoming THE bearer service for the Global
  Information Infrastructure.A key to the rapid growth of the Internet has been the
  free and open access to the basic documents, especially the specifications of the
  protocols.The beginnings of the ARPANET and the Internet in the university research
  community promoted the academic tradition of open publication of ideas and results.
  However, the normal cycle of traditional academic publication was too formal and
  too slow for the dynamic exchange of ideas essential to creating networks.In 1969
  a key step was taken by S. Crocker (then at UCLA) in establishing the Request for
  Comments (or RFC) series of notes. These memos were intended to be an informal fast
  distribution way to share ideas with other network researchers. At first the RFCs
  were printed on paper and distributed via snail mail. As the File Transfer Protocol
  (FTP) came into use, the RFCs were prepared as online files and accessed via FTP.
  Now, of course, the RFCs are easily accessed via the World Wide Web at dozens of
  sites around the world. SRI, in its role as Network Information Center, maintained
  the online directories. Jon Postel acted as RFC Editor as well as managing the centralized
  administration of required protocol number assignments, roles that he continued
  to play until his death, October 16, 1998.The effect of the RFCs was to create a
  positive feedback loop, with ideas or proposals presented in one RFC triggering
  another RFC with additional ideas, and so on. When some consensus (or a least a
  consistent set of ideas) had come together a specification document would be prepared.
  Such a specification would then be used as the base for implementations by the various
  research teams.Over time, the RFCs have become more focused on protocol standards
  (the "official" specifications), though there are still informational RFCs that
  describe alternate approaches, or provide background information on protocols and
  engineering issues. The RFCs are now viewed as the "documents of record" in the
  Internet engineering and standards community.The open access to the RFCs (for free,
  if you have any kind of a connection to the Internet) promotes the growth of the
  Internet because it allows the actual specifications to be used for examples in
  college classes and by entrepreneurs developing new systems.Email has been a significant
  factor in all areas of the Internet, and that is certainly true in the development
  of protocol specifications, technical standards, and Internet engineering. The very
  early RFCs often presented a set of ideas developed by the researchers at one location
  to the rest of the community. After email came into use, the authorship pattern
  changed - RFCs were presented by joint authors with common view independent of their
  locations.The use of specialized email mailing lists has been long used in the development
  of protocol specifications, and continues to be an important tool. The IETF now
  has in excess of 75 working groups, each working on a different aspect of Internet
  engineering. Each of these working groups has a mailing list to discuss one or more
  draft documents under development. When consensus is reached on a draft document
  it may be distributed as an RFC.As the current rapid expansion of the Internet is
  fueled by the realization of its capability to promote information sharing, we should
  understand that the network''s first role in information sharing was sharing the
  information about its own design and operation through the RFC documents. This unique
  method for evolving new capabilities in the network will continue to be critical
  to future evolution of the Internet.The Internet is as much a collection of communities
  as a collection of technologies, and its success is largely attributable to both
  satisfying basic community needs as well as utilizing the community in an effective
  way to push the infrastructure forward. This community spirit has a long history
  beginning with the early ARPANET. The early ARPANET researchers worked as a close-knit
  community to accomplish the initial demonstrations of packet switching technology
  described earlier. Likewise, the Packet Satellite, Packet Radio and several other
  DARPA computer science research programs were multi-contractor collaborative activities
  that heavily used whatever available mechanisms there were to coordinate their efforts,
  starting with electronic mail and adding file sharing, remote access, and eventually
  World Wide Web capabilities. Each of these programs formed a working group, starting
  with the ARPANET Network Working Group. Because of the unique role that ARPANET
  played as an infrastructure supporting the various research programs, as the Internet
  started to evolve, the Network Working Group evolved into Internet Working Group.In
  the late 1970s, recognizing that the growth of the Internet was accompanied by a
  growth in the size of the interested research community and therefore an increased
  need for coordination mechanisms, Vint Cerf, then manager of the Internet Program
  at DARPA, formed several coordination bodies - an International Cooperation Board
  (ICB), chaired by Peter Kirstein of UCL, to coordinate activities with some cooperating
  European countries centered on Packet Satellite research, an Internet Research Group
  which was an inclusive group providing an environment for general exchange of information,
  and an Internet Configuration Control Board (ICCB), chaired by Clark. The ICCB was
  an invitational body to assist Cerf in managing the burgeoning Internet activity.In
  1983, when Barry Leiner took over management of the Internet research program at
  DARPA, he and Clark recognized that the continuing growth of the Internet community
  demanded a restructuring of the coordination mechanisms. The ICCB was disbanded
  and in its place a structure of Task Forces was formed, each focused on a particular
  area of the technology (e.g. routers, end-to-end protocols, etc.). The Internet
  Activities Board (IAB) was formed from the chairs of the Task Forces.It of course
  was only a coincidence that the chairs of the Task Forces were the same people as
  the members of the old ICCB, and Dave Clark continued to act as chair. After some
  changing membership on the IAB, Phill Gross became chair of a revitalized Internet
  Engineering Task Force (IETF), at the time merely one of the IAB Task Forces. As
  we saw above, by 1985 there was a tremendous growth in the more practical/engineering
  side of the Internet. This growth resulted in an explosion in the attendance at
  the IETF meetings, and Gross was compelled to create substructure to the IETF in
  the form of working groups.This growth was complemented by a major expansion in
  the community. No longer was DARPA the only major player in the funding of the Internet.
  In addition to NSFNet and the various US and international government-funded activities,
  interest in the commercial sector was beginning to grow. Also in 1985, both Kahn
  and Leiner left DARPA and there was a significant decrease in Internet activity
  at DARPA. As a result, the IAB was left without a primary sponsor and increasingly
  assumed the mantle of leadership.The growth continued, resulting in even further
  substructure within both the IAB and IETF. The IETF combined Working Groups into
  Areas, and designated Area Directors. An Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG)
  was formed of the Area Directors. The IAB recognized the increasing importance of
  the IETF, and restructured the standards process to explicitly recognize the IESG
  as the major review body for standards. The IAB also restructured so that the rest
  of the Task Forces (other than the IETF) were combined into an Internet Research
  Task Force (IRTF) chaired by Postel, with the old task forces renamed as research
  groups.The growth in the commercial sector brought with it increased concern regarding
  the standards process itself. Starting in the early 1980''s and continuing to this
  day, the Internet grew beyond its primarily research roots to include both a broad
  user community and increased commercial activity. Increased attention was paid to
  making the process open and fair. This coupled with a recognized need for community
  support of the Internet eventually led to the formation of the Internet Society
  in 1991, under the auspices of Kahn''s Corporation for National Research Initiatives
  (CNRI) and the leadership of Cerf, then with CNRI.In 1992, yet another reorganization
  took place. In 1992, the Internet Activities Board was re-organized and re-named
  the Internet Architecture Board operating under the auspices of the Internet Society.
  A more "peer" relationship was defined between the new IAB and IESG, with the IETF
  and IESG taking a larger responsibility for the approval of standards. Ultimately,
  a cooperative and mutually supportive relationship was formed between the IAB, IETF,
  and Internet Society, with the Internet Society taking on as a goal the provision
  of service and other measures which would facilitate the work of the IETF.The recent
  development and widespread deployment of the World Wide Web has brought with it
  a new community, as many of the people working on the WWW have not thought of themselves
  as primarily network researchers and developers. A new coordination organization
  was formed, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Initially led from MIT''s Laboratory
  for Computer Science by Tim Berners-Lee (the inventor of the WWW) and Al Vezza,
  W3C has taken on the responsibility for evolving the various protocols and standards
  associated with the Web.Thus, through the over two decades of Internet activity,
  we have seen a steady evolution of organizational structures designed to support
  and facilitate an ever-increasing community working collaboratively on Internet
  issues.Commercialization of the Internet involved not only the development of competitive,
  private network services, but also the development of commercial products implementing
  the Internet technology. In the early 1980s, dozens of vendors were incorporating
  TCP/IP into their products because they saw buyers for that approach to networking.
  Unfortunately they lacked both real information about how the technology was supposed
  to work and how the customers planned on using this approach to networking. Many
  saw it as a nuisance add-on that had to be glued on to their own proprietary networking
  solutions: SNA, DECNet, Netware, NetBios. The DoD had mandated the use of TCP/IP
  in many of its purchases but gave little help to the vendors regarding how to build
  useful TCP/IP products.In 1985, recognizing this lack of information availability
  and appropriate training, Dan Lynch in cooperation with the IAB arranged to hold
  a three day workshop for ALL vendors to come learn about how TCP/IP worked and what
  it still could not do well. The speakers came mostly from the DARPA research community
  who had both developed these protocols and used them in day-to-day work. About 250
  vendor personnel came to listen to 50 inventors and experimenters. The results were
  surprises on both sides: the vendors were amazed to find that the inventors were
  so open about the way things worked (and what still did not work) and the inventors
  were pleased to listen to new problems they had not considered, but were being discovered
  by the vendors in the field. Thus a two-way discussion was formed that has lasted
  for over a decade.After two years of conferences, tutorials, design meetings and
  workshops, a special event was organized that invited those vendors whose products
  ran TCP/IP well enough to come together in one room for three days to show off how
  well they all worked together and also ran over the Internet. In September of 1988
  the first Interop trade show was born. 50 companies made the cut. 5,000 engineers
  from potential customer organizations came to see if it all did work as was promised.
  It did. Why? Because the vendors worked extremely hard to ensure that everyone''s
  products interoperated with all of the other products - even with those of their
  competitors. The Interop trade show has grown immensely since then and today it
  is held in 7 locations around the world each year to an audience of over 250,000
  people who come to learn which products work with each other in a seamless manner,
  learn about the latest products, and discuss the latest technology.In parallel with
  the commercialization efforts that were highlighted by the Interop activities, the
  vendors began to attend the IETF meetings that were held 3 or 4 times a year to
  discuss new ideas for extensions of the TCP/IP protocol suite. Starting with a few
  hundred attendees mostly from academia and paid for by the government, these meetings
  now often exceed a thousand attendees, mostly from the vendor community and paid
  for by the attendees themselves. This self-selected group evolves the TCP/IP suite
  in a mutually cooperative manner. The reason it is so useful is that it is composed
  of all stakeholders: researchers, end users and vendors.Network management provides
  an example of the interplay between the research and commercial communities. In
  the beginning of the Internet, the emphasis was on defining and implementing protocols
  that achieved interoperation.As the network grew larger, it became clear that the
  sometime ad hoc procedures used to manage the network would not scale. Manual configuration
  of tables was replaced by distributed automated algorithms, and better tools were
  devised to isolate faults. In 1987 it became clear that a protocol was needed that
  would permit the elements of the network, such as the routers, to be remotely managed
  in a uniform way. Several protocols for this purpose were proposed, including Simple
  Network Management Protocol or SNMP (designed, as its name would suggest, for simplicity,
  and derived from an earlier proposal called SGMP) , HEMS (a more complex design
  from the research community) and CMIP (from the OSI community). A series of meeting
  led to the decisions that HEMS would be withdrawn as a candidate for standardization,
  in order to help resolve the contention, but that work on both SNMP and CMIP would
  go forward, with the idea that the SNMP could be a more near-term solution and CMIP
  a longer-term approach. The market could choose the one it found more suitable.
  SNMP is now used almost universally for network-based management.In the last few
  years, we have seen a new phase of commercialization. Originally, commercial efforts
  mainly comprised vendors providing the basic networking products, and service providers
  offering the connectivity and basic Internet services. The Internet has now become
  almost a "commodity" service, and much of the latest attention has been on the use
  of this global information infrastructure for support of other commercial services.
  This has been tremendously accelerated by the widespread and rapid adoption of browsers
  and the World Wide Web technology, allowing users easy access to information linked
  throughout the globe. Products are available to facilitate the provisioning of that
  information and many of the latest developments in technology have been aimed at
  providing increasingly sophisticated information services on top of the basic Internet
  data communications.On October 24, 1995, the FNC unanimously passed a resolution
  defining the term Internet. This definition was developed in consultation with members
  of the internet and intellectual property rights communities. RESOLUTION: The Federal
  Networking Council (FNC) agrees that the following language reflects our definition
  of the term "Internet". "Internet" refers to the global information system that
  -- (i) is logically linked together by a globally unique address space based on
  the Internet Protocol (IP) or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons; (ii) is able
  to support communications using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
  (TCP/IP) suite or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons, and/or other IP-compatible
  protocols; and (iii) provides, uses or makes accessible, either publicly or privately,
  high level services layered on the communications and related infrastructure described
  herein.The Internet has changed much in the two decades since it came into existence.
  It was conceived in the era of time-sharing, but has survived into the era of personal
  computers, client-server and peer-to-peer computing, and the network computer. It
  was designed before LANs existed, but has accommodated that new network technology,
  as well as the more recent ATM and frame switched services. It was envisioned as
  supporting a range of functions from file sharing and remote login to resource sharing
  and collaboration, and has spawned electronic mail and more recently the World Wide
  Web. But most important, it started as the creation of a small band of dedicated
  researchers, and has grown to be a commercial success with billions of dollars of
  annual investment.One should not conclude that the Internet has now finished changing.
  The Internet, although a network in name and geography, is a creature of the computer,
  not the traditional network of the telephone or television industry. It will, indeed
  it must, continue to change and evolve at the speed of the computer industry if
  it is to remain relevant. It is now changing to provide new services such as real
  time transport, in order to support, for example, audio and video streams.The availability
  of pervasive networking (i.e., the Internet) along with powerful affordable computing
  and communications in portable form (i.e., laptop computers, two-way pagers, PDAs,
  cellular phones), is making possible a new paradigm of nomadic computing and communications.
  This evolution will bring us new applications - Internet telephone and, slightly
  further out, Internet television. It is evolving to permit more sophisticated forms
  of pricing and cost recovery, a perhaps painful requirement in this commercial world.
  It is changing to accommodate yet another generation of underlying network technologies
  with different characteristics and requirements, e.g. broadband residential access
  and satellites. New modes of access and new forms of service will spawn new applications,
  which in turn will drive further evolution of the net itself.The most pressing question
  for the future of the Internet is not how the technology will change, but how the
  process of change and evolution itself will be managed. As this paper describes,
  the architecture of the Internet has always been driven by a core group of designers,
  but the form of that group has changed as the number of interested parties has grown.
  With the success of the Internet has come a proliferation of stakeholders - stakeholders
  now with an economic as well as an intellectual investment in the network.We now
  see, in the debates over control of the domain name space and the form of the next
  generation IP addresses, a struggle to find the next social structure that will
  guide the Internet in the future. The form of that structure will be harder to find,
  given the large number of concerned stakeholders. At the same time, the industry
  struggles to find the economic rationale for the large investment needed for the
  future growth, for example to upgrade residential access to a more suitable technology.
  If the Internet stumbles, it will not be because we lack for technology, vision,
  or motivation. It will be because we cannot set a direction and march collectively
  into the future. Timeline1 Perhaps this is an exaggeration based on the lead author''s
  residence in Silicon Valley.2 On a recent trip to a Tokyo bookstore, one of the
  authors counted 14 English language magazines devoted to the Internet.3 An abbreviated
  version of this article appears in the 50th anniversary issue of the CACM, Feb.
  97. The authors would like to express their appreciation to Andy Rosenbloom, CACM
  Senior Editor, for both instigating the writing of this article and his invaluable
  assistance in editing both this and the abbreviated version.4 The Advanced Research
  Projects Agency (ARPA) changed its name to Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
  (DARPA) in 1971, then back to ARPA in 1993, and back to DARPA in 1996. We refer
  throughout to DARPA, the current name.5 It was from the RAND study that the false
  rumor started claiming that the ARPANET was somehow related to building a network
  resistant to nuclear war. This was never true of the ARPANET, only the unrelated
  RAND study on secure voice considered nuclear war. However, the later work on Internetting
  did emphasize robustness and survivability, including the capability to withstand
  losses of large portions of the underlying networks.6 Including amongst others Vint
  Cerf, Steve Crocker, and Jon Postel. Joining them later were David Crocker who was
  to play an important role in documentation of electronic mail protocols, and Robert
  Braden, who developed the first NCP and then TCP for IBM mainframes and also was
  to play a long term role in the ICCB and IAB.7 This was subsequently published as
  V. G. Cerf and R. E. Kahn, "A protocol for packet network interconnection" IEEE
  Trans. Comm. Tech., vol. COM-22, V 5, pp. 627-641, May 1974.8 The desirability of
  email interchange, however, led to one of the first "Internet books": !%@:: A Directory
  of Electronic Mail Addressing and Networks, by Frey and Adams, on email address
  translation and forwarding.9 Originally named Federal Research Internet Coordinating
  Committee, FRICC. The FRICC was originally formed to coordinate U.S. research network
  activities in support of the international coordination provided by the CCIRN.10

  Internet has revolutionized the computer and communications world like nothing before.
  The invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio, and computer set the stage for
  this unprecedented integration of capabilities. The Internet is at once a world-wide
  broadcasting capability, a mechanism for information dissemination, and a medium
  for collaboration and interaction between individuals and their computers without
  regard for geographic location. The Internet represents one of the most successful
  examples of the benefits of sustained investment and commitment to research and
  development of information infrastructure. Beginning with the early research in
  packet switching, the government, industry and academia have been partners in evolving
  and deploying this exciting new technology. Today, terms like \"bleiner@computer.org\"
  and \"http://www.acm.org\" trip lightly off the tongue of the random person on the
  street. 1\nThis is intended to be a brief, necessarily cursory and incomplete history.
  Much material currently exists about the Internet, covering history, technology,
  and usage. A trip to almost any bookstore will find shelves of material written
  about the Internet. 2\nIn this paper,3 several of us involved in the development
  and evolution of the Internet share our views of its origins and history. This history
  revolves around four distinct aspects. There is the technological evolution that
  began with early research on packet switching and the ARPANET (and related technologies),
  and where current research continues to expand the horizons of the infrastructure
  along several dimensions, such as scale, performance, and higher-level functionality.
  There is the operations and management aspect of a global and complex operational
  infrastructure. There is the social aspect, which resulted in a broad community
  of Internauts working together to create and evolve the technology. And there is
  the commercialization aspect, resulting in an extremely effective transition of
  research results into a broadly deployed and available information infrastructure.\nThe
  Internet today is a widespread information infrastructure, the initial prototype
  of what is often called the National (or Global or Galactic) Information Infrastructure.
  Its history is complex and involves many aspects - technological, organizational,
  and community. And its influence reaches not only to the technical fields of computer
  communications but throughout society as we move toward increasing use of online
  tools to accomplish electronic commerce, information acquisition, and community
  operations.\nOrigins of the Internet\nThe first recorded description of the social
  interactions that could be enabled through networking was a series of memos written
  by J.C.R. Licklider of MIT in August 1962 discussing his \"Galactic Network\" concept.
  He envisioned a globally interconnected set of computers through which everyone
  could quickly access data and programs from any site. In spirit, the concept was
  very much like the Internet of today. Licklider was the first head of the computer
  research program at DARPA,4 starting in October 1962. While at DARPA he convinced
  his successors at DARPA, Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and MIT researcher Lawrence
  G. Roberts, of the importance of this networking concept.\nLeonard Kleinrock at
  MIT published the first paper on packet switching theory in July 1961 and the first
  book on the subject in 1964. Kleinrock convinced Roberts of the theoretical feasibility
  of communications using packets rather than circuits, which was a major step along
  the path towards computer networking. The other key step was to make the computers
  talk together. To explore this, in 1965 working with Thomas Merrill, Roberts connected
  the TX-2 computer in Mass. to the Q-32 in California with a low speed dial-up telephone
  line creating the first (however small) wide-area computer network ever built. The
  result of this experiment was the realization that the time-shared computers could
  work well together, running programs and retrieving data as necessary on the remote
  machine, but that the circuit switched telephone system was totally inadequate for
  the job. Kleinrock's conviction of the need for packet switching was confirmed.\nIn
  late 1966 Roberts went to DARPA to develop the computer network concept and quickly
  put together his plan for the \"ARPANET\", publishing it in 1967. At the conference
  where he presented the paper, there was also a paper on a packet network concept
  from the UK by Donald Davies and Roger Scantlebury of NPL. Scantlebury told Roberts
  about the NPL work as well as that of Paul Baran and others at RAND. The RAND group
  had written a paper on packet switching networks for secure voice in the military
  in 1964. It happened that the work at MIT (1961-1967), at RAND (1962-1965), and
  at NPL (1964-1967) had all proceeded in parallel without any of the researchers
  knowing about the other work. The word \"packet\" was adopted from the work at NPL
  and the proposed line speed to be used in the ARPANET design was upgraded from 2.4
  kbps to 50 kbps. 5\nIn August 1968, after Roberts and the DARPA funded community
  had refined the overall structure and specifications for the ARPANET, an RFQ was
  released by DARPA for the development of one of the key components, the packet switches
  called Interface Message Processors (IMP's). The RFQ was won in December 1968 by
  a group headed by Frank Heart at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN). As the BBN team
  worked on the IMP's with Bob Kahn playing a major role in the overall ARPANET architectural
  design, the network topology and economics were designed and optimized by Roberts
  working with Howard Frank and his team at Network Analysis Corporation, and the
  network measurement system was prepared by Kleinrock's team at UCLA. 6\nDue to Kleinrock's
  early development of packet switching theory and his focus on analysis, design and
  measurement, his Network Measurement Center at UCLA was selected to be the first
  node on the ARPANET. All this came together in September 1969 when BBN installed
  the first IMP at UCLA and the first host computer was connected. Doug Engelbart's
  project on \"Augmentation of Human Intellect\" (which included NLS, an early hypertext
  system) at Stanford Research Institute (SRI) provided a second node. SRI supported
  the Network Information Center, led by Elizabeth (Jake) Feinler and including functions
  such as maintaining tables of host name to address mapping as well as a directory
  of the RFC's.\nOne month later, when SRI was connected to the ARPANET, the first
  host-to-host message was sent from Kleinrock's laboratory to SRI. Two more nodes
  were added at UC Santa Barbara and University of Utah. These last two nodes incorporated
  application visualization projects, with Glen Culler and Burton Fried at UCSB investigating
  methods for display of mathematical functions using storage displays to deal with
  the problem of refresh over the net, and Robert Taylor and Ivan Sutherland at Utah
  investigating methods of 3-D representations over the net. Thus, by the end of 1969,
  four host computers were connected together into the initial ARPANET, and the budding
  Internet was off the ground. Even at this early stage, it should be noted that the
  networking research incorporated both work on the underlying network and work on
  how to utilize the network. This tradition continues to this day.\nComputers were
  added quickly to the ARPANET during the following years, and work proceeded on completing
  a functionally complete Host-to-Host protocol and other network software. In December
  1970 the Network Working Group (NWG) working under S. Crocker finished the initial
  ARPANET Host-to-Host protocol, called the Network Control Protocol (NCP). As the
  ARPANET sites completed implementing NCP during the period 1971-1972, the network
  users finally could begin to develop applications.\nIn October 1972, Kahn organized
  a large, very successful demonstration of the ARPANET at the International Computer
  Communication Conference (ICCC). This was the first public demonstration of this
  new network technology to the public. It was also in 1972 that the initial \"hot\"
  application, electronic mail, was introduced. In March Ray Tomlinson at BBN wrote
  the basic email message send and read software, motivated by the need of the ARPANET
  developers for an easy coordination mechanism. In July, Roberts expanded its utility
  by writing the first email utility program to list, selectively read, file, forward,
  and respond to messages. From there email took off as the largest network application
  for over a decade. This was a harbinger of the kind of activity we see on the World
  Wide Web today, namely, the enormous growth of all kinds of \"people-to-people\"
  traffic.\nThe Initial Internetting Concepts\nThe original ARPANET grew into the
  Internet. Internet was based on the idea that there would be multiple independent
  networks of rather arbitrary design, beginning with the ARPANET as the pioneering
  packet switching network, but soon to include packet satellite networks, ground-based
  packet radio networks and other networks. The Internet as we now know it embodies
  a key underlying technical idea, namely that of open architecture networking. In
  this approach, the choice of any individual network technology was not dictated
  by a particular network architecture but rather could be selected freely by a provider
  and made to interwork with the other networks through a meta-level \"Internetworking
  Architecture\". Up until that time there was only one general method for federating
  networks. This was the traditional circuit switching method where networks would
  interconnect at the circuit level, passing individual bits on a synchronous basis
  along a portion of an end-to-end circuit between a pair of end locations. Recall
  that Kleinrock had shown in 1961 that packet switching was a more efficient switching
  method. Along with packet switching, special purpose interconnection arrangements
  between networks were another possibility. While there were other limited ways to
  interconnect different networks, they required that one be used as a component of
  the other, rather than acting as a peer of the other in offering end-to-end service.\nIn
  an open-architecture network, the individual networks may be separately designed
  and developed and each may have its own unique interface which it may offer to users
  and/or other providers. including other Internet providers. Each network can be
  designed in accordance with the specific environment and user requirements of that
  network. There are generally no constraints on the types of network that can be
  included or on their geographic scope, although certain pragmatic considerations
  will dictate what makes sense to offer.\nThe idea of open-architecture networking
  was first introduced by Kahn shortly after having arrived at DARPA in 1972. This
  work was originally part of the packet radio program, but subsequently became a
  separate program in its own right. At the time, the program was called \"Internetting\".
  Key to making the packet radio system work was a reliable end-end protocol that
  could maintain effective communication in the face of jamming and other radio interference,
  or withstand intermittent blackout such as caused by being in a tunnel or blocked
  by the local terrain. Kahn first contemplated developing a protocol local only to
  the packet radio network, since that would avoid having to deal with the multitude
  of different operating systems, and continuing to use NCP.\nHowever, NCP did not
  have the ability to address networks (and machines) further downstream than a destination
  IMP on the ARPANET and thus some change to NCP would also be required. (The assumption
  was that the ARPANET was not changeable in this regard). NCP relied on ARPANET to
  provide end-to-end reliability. If any packets were lost, the protocol (and presumably
  any applications it supported) would come to a grinding halt. In this model NCP
  had no end-end host error control, since the ARPANET was to be the only network
  in existence and it would be so reliable that no error control would be required
  on the part of the hosts. Thus, Kahn decided to develop a new version of the protocol
  which could meet the needs of an open-architecture network environment. This protocol
  would eventually be called the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).
  While NCP tended to act like a device driver, the new protocol would be more like
  a communications protocol.\nFour ground rules were critical to Kahn's early thinking:\nEach
  distinct network would have to stand on its own and no internal changes could be
  required to any such network to connect it to the Internet.\nCommunications would
  be on a best effort basis. If a packet didn't make it to the final destination,
  it would shortly be retransmitted from the source.\nBlack boxes would be used to
  connect the networks; these would later be called gateways and routers. There would
  be no information retained by the gateways about the individual flows of packets
  passing through them, thereby keeping them simple and avoiding complicated adaptation
  and recovery from various failure modes.\nThere would be no global control at the
  operations level.\nOther key issues that needed to be addressed were:\nAlgorithms
  to prevent lost packets from permanently disabling communications and enabling them
  to be successfully retransmitted from the source.\nProviding for host-to-host \"pipelining\"
  so that multiple packets could be enroute from source to destination at the discretion
  of the participating hosts, if the intermediate networks allowed it.\nGateway functions
  to allow it to forward packets appropriately. This included interpreting IP headers
  for routing, handling interfaces, breaking packets into smaller pieces if necessary,
  etc.\nThe need for end-end checksums, reassembly of packets from fragments and detection
  of duplicates, if any.\nThe need for global addressing\nTechniques for host-to-host
  flow control.\nInterfacing with the various operating systems\nThere were also other
  concerns, such as implementation efficiency, internetwork performance, but these
  were secondary considerations at first.\nKahn began work on a communications-oriented
  set of operating system principles while at BBN and documented some of his early
  thoughts in an internal BBN memorandum entitled \"Communications Principles for
  Operating Systems\". At this point he realized it would be necessary to learn the
  implementation details of each operating system to have a chance to embed any new
  protocols in an efficient way. Thus, in the spring of 1973, after starting the internetting
  effort, he asked Vint Cerf (then at Stanford) to work with him on the detailed design
  of the protocol. Cerf had been intimately involved in the original NCP design and
  development and already had the knowledge about interfacing to existing operating
  systems. So armed with Kahn's architectural approach to the communications side
  and with Cerf's NCP experience, they teamed up to spell out the details of what
  became TCP/IP.\nThe give and take was highly productive and the first written version7
  of the resulting approach was distributed at a special meeting of the International
  Network Working Group (INWG) which had been set up at a conference at Sussex University
  in September 1973. Cerf had been invited to chair this group and used the occasion
  to hold a meeting of INWG members who were heavily represented at the Sussex Conference.\nSome
  basic approaches emerged from this collaboration between Kahn and Cerf:\nCommunication
  between two processes would logically consist of a very long stream of bytes (they
  called them octets). The position of any octet in the stream would be used to identify
  it.\nFlow control would be done by using sliding windows and acknowledgments (acks).
  The destination could select when to acknowledge and each ack returned would be
  cumulative for all packets received to that point.\nIt was left open as to exactly
  how the source and destination would agree on the parameters of the windowing to
  be used. Defaults were used initially.\nAlthough Ethernet was under development
  at Xerox PARC at that time, the proliferation of LANs were not envisioned at the
  time, much less PCs and workstations. The original model was national level networks
  like ARPANET of which only a relatively small number were expected to exist. Thus
  a 32 bit IP address was used of which the first 8 bits signified the network and
  the remaining 24 bits designated the host on that network. This assumption, that
  256 networks would be sufficient for the foreseeable future, was clearly in need
  of reconsideration when LANs began to appear in the late 1970s.\nThe original Cerf/Kahn
  paper on the Internet described one protocol, called TCP, which provided all the
  transport and forwarding services in the Internet. Kahn had intended that the TCP
  protocol support a range of transport services, from the totally reliable sequenced
  delivery of data (virtual circuit model) to a datagram service in which the application
  made direct use of the underlying network service, which might imply occasional
  lost, corrupted or reordered packets. However, the initial effort to implement TCP
  resulted in a version that only allowed for virtual circuits. This model worked
  fine for file transfer and remote login applications, but some of the early work
  on advanced network applications, in particular packet voice in the 1970s, made
  clear that in some cases packet losses should not be corrected by TCP, but should
  be left to the application to deal with. This led to a reorganization of the original
  TCP into two protocols, the simple IP which provided only for addressing and forwarding
  of individual packets, and the separate TCP, which was concerned with service features
  such as flow control and recovery from lost packets. For those applications that
  did not want the services of TCP, an alternative called the User Datagram Protocol
  (UDP) was added in order to provide direct access to the basic service of IP.\nA
  major initial motivation for both the ARPANET and the Internet was resource sharing
  - for example allowing users on the packet radio networks to access the time sharing
  systems attached to the ARPANET. Connecting the two together was far more economical
  that duplicating these very expensive computers. However, while file transfer and
  remote login (Telnet) were very important applications, electronic mail has probably
  had the most significant impact of the innovations from that era. Email provided
  a new model of how people could communicate with each other, and changed the nature
  of collaboration, first in the building of the Internet itself (as is discussed
  below) and later for much of society.\nThere were other applications proposed in
  the early days of the Internet, including packet based voice communication (the
  precursor of Internet telephony), various models of file and disk sharing, and early
  \"worm\" programs that showed the concept of agents (and, of course, viruses). A
  key concept of the Internet is that it was not designed for just one application,
  but as a general infrastructure on which new applications could be conceived, as
  illustrated later by the emergence of the World Wide Web. It is the general purpose
  nature of the service provided by TCP and IP that makes this possible.\nProving
  the Ideas\nDARPA let three contracts to Stanford (Cerf), BBN (Ray Tomlinson) and
  UCL (Peter Kirstein) to implement TCP/IP (it was simply called TCP in the Cerf/Kahn
  paper but contained both components). The Stanford team, led by Cerf, produced the
  detailed specification and within about a year there were three independent implementations
  of TCP that could interoperate.\nThis was the beginning of long term experimentation
  and development to evolve and mature the Internet concepts and technology. Beginning
  with the first three networks (ARPANET, Packet Radio, and Packet Satellite) and
  their initial research communities, the experimental environment has grown to incorporate
  essentially every form of network and a very broad-based research and development
  community. [REK78] With each expansion has come new challenges.\nThe early implementations
  of TCP were done for large time sharing systems such as Tenex and TOPS 20. When
  desktop computers first appeared, it was thought by some that TCP was too big and
  complex to run on a personal computer. David Clark and his research group at MIT
  set out to show that a compact and simple implementation of TCP was possible. They
  produced an implementation, first for the Xerox Alto (the early personal workstation
  developed at Xerox PARC) and then for the IBM PC. That implementation was fully
  interoperable with other TCPs, but was tailored to the application suite and performance
  objectives of the personal computer, and showed that workstations, as well as large
  time-sharing systems, could be a part of the Internet. In 1976, Kleinrock published
  the first book on the ARPANET. It included an emphasis on the complexity of protocols
  and the pitfalls they often introduce. This book was influential in spreading the
  lore of packet switching networks to a very wide community.\nWidespread development
  of LANS, PCs and workstations in the 1980s allowed the nascent Internet to flourish.
  Ethernet technology, developed by Bob Metcalfe at Xerox PARC in 1973, is now probably
  the dominant network technology in the Internet and PCs and workstations the dominant
  computers. This change from having a few networks with a modest number of time-shared
  hosts (the original ARPANET model) to having many networks has resulted in a number
  of new concepts and changes to the underlying technology. First, it resulted in
  the definition of three network classes (A, B, and C) to accommodate the range of
  networks. Class A represented large national scale networks (small number of networks
  with large numbers of hosts); Class B represented regional scale networks; and Class
  C represented local area networks (large number of networks with relatively few
  hosts).\nA major shift occurred as a result of the increase in scale of the Internet
  and its associated management issues. To make it easy for people to use the network,
  hosts were assigned names, so that it was not necessary to remember the numeric
  addresses. Originally, there were a fairly limited number of hosts, so it was feasible
  to maintain a single table of all the hosts and their associated names and addresses.
  The shift to having a large number of independently managed networks (e.g., LANs)
  meant that having a single table of hosts was no longer feasible, and the Domain
  Name System (DNS) was invented by Paul Mockapetris of USC/ISI. The DNS permitted
  a scalable distributed mechanism for resolving hierarchical host names (e.g. www.acm.org)
  into an Internet address.\nThe increase in the size of the Internet also challenged
  the capabilities of the routers. Originally, there was a single distributed algorithm
  for routing that was implemented uniformly by all the routers in the Internet. As
  the number of networks in the Internet exploded, this initial design could not expand
  as necessary, so it was replaced by a hierarchical model of routing, with an Interior
  Gateway Protocol (IGP) used inside each region of the Internet, and an Exterior
  Gateway Protocol (EGP) used to tie the regions together. This design permitted different
  regions to use a different IGP, so that different requirements for cost, rapid reconfiguration,
  robustness and scale could be accommodated. Not only the routing algorithm, but
  the size of the addressing tables, stressed the capacity of the routers. New approaches
  for address aggregation, in particular classless inter-domain routing (CIDR), have
  recently been introduced to control the size of router tables.\nAs the Internet
  evolved, one of the major challenges was how to propagate the changes to the software,
  particularly the host software. DARPA supported UC Berkeley to investigate modifications
  to the Unix operating system, including incorporating TCP/IP developed at BBN. Although
  Berkeley later rewrote the BBN code to more efficiently fit into the Unix system
  and kernel, the incorporation of TCP/IP into the Unix BSD system releases proved
  to be a critical element in dispersion of the protocols to the research community.
  Much of the CS research community began to use Unix BSD for their day-to-day computing
  environment. Looking back, the strategy of incorporating Internet protocols into
  a supported operating system for the research community was one of the key elements
  in the successful widespread adoption of the Internet.\nOne of the more interesting
  challenges was the transition of the ARPANET host protocol from NCP to TCP/IP as
  of January 1, 1983. This was a \"flag-day\" style transition, requiring all hosts
  to convert simultaneously or be left having to communicate via rather ad-hoc mechanisms.
  This transition was carefully planned within the community over several years before
  it actually took place and went surprisingly smoothly (but resulted in a distribution
  of buttons saying \"I survived the TCP/IP transition\").\nTCP/IP was adopted as
  a defense standard three years earlier in 1980. This enabled defense to begin sharing
  in the DARPA Internet technology base and led directly to the eventual partitioning
  of the military and non- military communities. By 1983, ARPANET was being used by
  a significant number of defense R&D and operational organizations. The transition
  of ARPANET from NCP to TCP/IP permitted it to be split into a MILNET supporting
  operational requirements and an ARPANET supporting research needs.\nThus, by 1985,
  Internet was already well established as a technology supporting a broad community
  of researchers and developers, and was beginning to be used by other communities
  for daily computer communications. Electronic mail was being used broadly across
  several communities, often with different systems, but interconnection between different
  mail systems was demonstrating the utility of broad based electronic communications
  between people.\nTransition to Widespread Infrastructure\nAt the same time that
  the Internet technology was being experimentally validated and widely used amongst
  a subset of computer science researchers, other networks and networking technologies
  were being pursued. The usefulness of computer networking - especially electronic
  mail - demonstrated by DARPA and Department of Defense contractors on the ARPANET
  was not lost on other communities and disciplines, so that by the mid-1970s computer
  networks had begun to spring up wherever funding could be found for the purpose.
  The U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) established MFENet for its researchers in Magnetic
  Fusion Energy, whereupon DoE's High Energy Physicists responded by building HEPNet.
  NASA Space Physicists followed with SPAN, and Rick Adrion, David Farber, and Larry
  Landweber established CSNET for the (academic and industrial) Computer Science community
  with an initial grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF). AT&T's free-wheeling
  dissemination of the UNIX computer operating system spawned USENET, based on UNIX'
  built-in UUCP communication protocols, and in 1981 Ira Fuchs and Greydon Freeman
  devised BITNET, which linked academic mainframe computers in an \"email as card
  images\" paradigm.\nWith the exception of BITNET and USENET, these early networks
  (including ARPANET) were purpose-built - i.e., they were intended for, and largely
  restricted to, closed communities of scholars; there was hence little pressure for
  the individual networks to be compatible and, indeed, they largely were not. In
  addition, alternate technologies were being pursued in the commercial sector, including
  XNS from Xerox, DECNet, and IBM's SNA.8 It remained for the British JANET (1984)
  and U.S. NSFNET (1985) programs to explicitly announce their intent to serve the
  entire higher education community, regardless of discipline. Indeed, a condition
  for a U.S. university to receive NSF funding for an Internet connection was that
  \"... the connection must be made available to ALL qualified users on campus.\"\nIn
  1985, Dennis Jennings came from Ireland to spend a year at NSF leading the NSFNET
  program. He worked with the community to help NSF make a critical decision - that
  TCP/IP would be mandatory for the NSFNET program. When Steve Wolff took over the
  NSFNET program in 1986, he recognized the need for a wide area networking infrastructure
  to support the general academic and research community, along with the need to develop
  a strategy for establishing such infrastructure on a basis ultimately independent
  of direct federal funding. Policies and strategies were adopted (see below) to achieve
  that end.\nNSF also elected to support DARPA's existing Internet organizational
  infrastructure, hierarchically arranged under the (then) Internet Activities Board
  (IAB). The public declaration of this choice was the joint authorship by the IAB's
  Internet Engineering and Architecture Task Forces and by NSF's Network Technical
  Advisory Group of RFC 985 (Requirements for Internet Gateways ), which formally
  ensured interoperability of DARPA's and NSF's pieces of the Internet.\nIn addition
  to the selection of TCP/IP for the NSFNET program, Federal agencies made and implemented
  several other policy decisions which shaped the Internet of today.\nFederal agencies
  shared the cost of common infrastructure, such as trans-oceanic circuits. They also
  jointly supported \"managed interconnection points\" for interagency traffic; the
  Federal Internet Exchanges (FIX-E and FIX-W) built for this purpose served as models
  for the Network Access Points and \"*IX\" facilities that are prominent features
  of today's Internet architecture.\nTo coordinate this sharing, the Federal Networking
  Council9 was formed. The FNC also cooperated with other international organizations,
  such as RARE in Europe, through the Coordinating Committee on Intercontinental Research
  Networking, CCIRN, to coordinate Internet support of the research community worldwide.\nThis
  sharing and cooperation between agencies on Internet-related issues had a long history.
  An unprecedented 1981 agreement between Farber, acting for CSNET and the NSF, and
  DARPA's Kahn, permitted CSNET traffic to share ARPANET infrastructure on a statistical
  and no-metered-settlements basis.\nSubsequently, in a similar mode, the NSF encouraged
  its regional (initially academic) networks of the NSFNET to seek commercial, non-academic
  customers, expand their facilities to serve them, and exploit the resulting economies
  of scale to lower subscription costs for all.\nOn the NSFNET Backbone - the national-scale
  segment of the NSFNET - NSF enforced an \"Acceptable Use Policy\" (AUP) which prohibited
  Backbone usage for purposes \"not in support of Research and Education.\" The predictable
  (and intended) result of encouraging commercial network traffic at the local and
  regional level, while denying its access to national-scale transport, was to stimulate
  the emergence and/or growth of \"private\", competitive, long-haul networks such
  as PSI, UUNET, ANS CO+RE, and (later) others. This process of privately-financed
  augmentation for commercial uses was thrashed out starting in 1988 in a series of
  NSF-initiated conferences at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government on \"The Commercialization
  and Privatization of the Internet\" - and on the \"com-priv\" list on the net itself.\nIn
  1988, a National Research Council committee, chaired by Kleinrock and with Kahn
  and Clark as members, produced a report commissioned by NSF titled \"Towards a National
  Research Network\". This report was influential on then Senator Al Gore, and ushered
  in high speed networks that laid the networking foundation for the future information
  superhighway.\nIn 1994, a National Research Council report, again chaired by Kleinrock
  (and with Kahn and Clark as members again), Entitled \"Realizing The Information
  Future: The Internet and Beyond\" was released. This report, commissioned by NSF,
  was the document in which a blueprint for the evolution of the information superhighway
  was articulated and which has had a lasting affect on the way to think about its
  evolution. It anticipated the critical issues of intellectual property rights, ethics,
  pricing, education, architecture and regulation for the Internet.\nNSF's privatization
  policy culminated in April, 1995, with the defunding of the NSFNET Backbone. The
  funds thereby recovered were (competitively) redistributed to regional networks
  to buy national-scale Internet connectivity from the now numerous, private, long-haul
  networks.\nThe backbone had made the transition from a network built from routers
  out of the research community (the \"Fuzzball\" routers from David Mills) to commercial
  equipment. In its 8 1/2 year lifetime, the Backbone had grown from six nodes with
  56 kbps links to 21 nodes with multiple 45 Mbps links. It had seen the Internet
  grow to over 50,000 networks on all seven continents and outer space, with approximately
  29,000 networks in the United States.\nSuch was the weight of the NSFNET program's
  ecumenism and funding ($200 million from 1986 to 1995) - and the quality of the
  protocols themselves - that by 1990 when the ARPANET itself was finally decommissioned10,
  TCP/IP had supplanted or marginalized most other wide-area computer network protocols
  worldwide, and IP was well on its way to becoming THE bearer service for the Global
  Information Infrastructure.\nThe Role of Documentation\nA key to the rapid growth
  of the Internet has been the free and open access to the basic documents, especially
  the specifications of the protocols.\nThe beginnings of the ARPANET and the Internet
  in the university research community promoted the academic tradition of open publication
  of ideas and results. However, the normal cycle of traditional academic publication
  was too formal and too slow for the dynamic exchange of ideas essential to creating
  networks.\nIn 1969 a key step was taken by S. Crocker (then at UCLA) in establishing
  the Request for Comments (or RFC) series of notes. These memos were intended to
  be an informal fast distribution way to share ideas with other network researchers.
  At first the RFCs were printed on paper and distributed via snail mail. As the File
  Transfer Protocol (FTP) came into use, the RFCs were prepared as online files and
  accessed via FTP. Now, of course, the RFCs are easily accessed via the World Wide
  Web at dozens of sites around the world. SRI, in its role as Network Information
  Center, maintained the online directories. Jon Postel acted as RFC Editor as well
  as managing the centralized administration of required protocol number assignments,
  roles that he continued to play until his death, October 16, 1998.\nThe effect of
  the RFCs was to create a positive feedback loop, with ideas or proposals presented
  in one RFC triggering another RFC with additional ideas, and so on. When some consensus
  (or a least a consistent set of ideas) had come together a specification document
  would be prepared. Such a specification would then be used as the base for implementations
  by the various research teams.\nOver time, the RFCs have become more focused on
  protocol standards (the \"official\" specifications), though there are still informational
  RFCs that describe alternate approaches, or provide background information on protocols
  and engineering issues. The RFCs are now viewed as the \"documents of record\" in
  the Internet engineering and standards community.\nThe open access to the RFCs (for
  free, if you have any kind of a connection to the Internet) promotes the growth
  of the Internet because it allows the actual specifications to be used for examples
  in college classes and by entrepreneurs developing new systems.\nEmail has been
  a significant factor in all areas of the Internet, and that is certainly true in
  the development of protocol specifications, technical standards, and Internet engineering.
  The very early RFCs often presented a set of ideas developed by the researchers
  at one location to the rest of the community. After email came into use, the authorship
  pattern changed - RFCs were presented by joint authors with common view independent
  of their locations.\nThe use of specialized email mailing lists has been long used
  in the development of protocol specifications, and continues to be an important
  tool. The IETF now has in excess of 75 working groups, each working on a different
  aspect of Internet engineering. Each of these working groups has a mailing list
  to discuss one or more draft documents under development. When consensus is reached
  on a draft document it may be distributed as an RFC.\nAs the current rapid expansion
  of the Internet is fueled by the realization of its capability to promote information
  sharing, we should understand that the network's first role in information sharing
  was sharing the information about its own design and operation through the RFC documents.
  This unique method for evolving new capabilities in the network will continue to
  be critical to future evolution of the Internet.\nFormation of the Broad Community\nThe
  Internet is as much a collection of communities as a collection of technologies,
  and its success is largely attributable to both satisfying basic community needs
  as well as utilizing the community in an effective way to push the infrastructure
  forward. This community spirit has a long history beginning with the early ARPANET.
  The early ARPANET researchers worked as a close-knit community to accomplish the
  initial demonstrations of packet switching technology described earlier. Likewise,
  the Packet Satellite, Packet Radio and several other DARPA computer science research
  programs were multi-contractor collaborative activities that heavily used whatever
  available mechanisms there were to coordinate their efforts, starting with electronic
  mail and adding file sharing, remote access, and eventually World Wide Web capabilities.
  Each of these programs formed a working group, starting with the ARPANET Network
  Working Group. Because of the unique role that ARPANET played as an infrastructure
  supporting the various research programs, as the Internet started to evolve, the
  Network Working Group evolved into Internet Working Group.\nIn the late 1970s, recognizing
  that the growth of the Internet was accompanied by a growth in the size of the interested
  research community and therefore an increased need for coordination mechanisms,
  Vint Cerf, then manager of the Internet Program at DARPA, formed several coordination
  bodies - an International Cooperation Board (ICB), chaired by Peter Kirstein of
  UCL, to coordinate activities with some cooperating European countries centered
  on Packet Satellite research, an Internet Research Group which was an inclusive
  group providing an environment for general exchange of information, and an Internet
  Configuration Control Board (ICCB), chaired by Clark. The ICCB was an invitational
  body to assist Cerf in managing the burgeoning Internet activity.\nIn 1983, when
  Barry Leiner took over management of the Internet research program at DARPA, he
  and Clark recognized that the continuing growth of the Internet community demanded
  a restructuring of the coordination mechanisms. The ICCB was disbanded and in its
  place a structure of Task Forces was formed, each focused on a particular area of
  the technology (e.g. routers, end-to-end protocols, etc.). The Internet Activities
  Board (IAB) was formed from the chairs of the Task Forces.\nIt of course was only
  a coincidence that the chairs of the Task Forces were the same people as the members
  of the old ICCB, and Dave Clark continued to act as chair. After some changing membership
  on the IAB, Phill Gross became chair of a revitalized Internet Engineering Task
  Force (IETF), at the time merely one of the IAB Task Forces. As we saw above, by
  1985 there was a tremendous growth in the more practical/engineering side of the
  Internet. This growth resulted in an explosion in the attendance at the IETF meetings,
  and Gross was compelled to create substructure to the IETF in the form of working
  groups.\nThis growth was complemented by a major expansion in the community. No
  longer was DARPA the only major player in the funding of the Internet. In addition
  to NSFNet and the various US and international government-funded activities, interest
  in the commercial sector was beginning to grow. Also in 1985, both Kahn and Leiner
  left DARPA and there was a significant decrease in Internet activity at DARPA. As
  a result, the IAB was left without a primary sponsor and increasingly assumed the
  mantle of leadership.\nThe growth continued, resulting in even further substructure
  within both the IAB and IETF. The IETF combined Working Groups into Areas, and designated
  Area Directors. An Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) was formed of the
  Area Directors. The IAB recognized the increasing importance of the IETF, and restructured
  the standards process to explicitly recognize the IESG as the major review body
  for standards. The IAB also restructured so that the rest of the Task Forces (other
  than the IETF) were combined into an Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) chaired
  by Postel, with the old task forces renamed as research groups.\nThe growth in the
  commercial sector brought with it increased concern regarding the standards process
  itself. Starting in the early 1980's and continuing to this day, the Internet grew
  beyond its primarily research roots to include both a broad user community and increased
  commercial activity. Increased attention was paid to making the process open and
  fair. This coupled with a recognized need for community support of the Internet
  eventually led to the formation of the Internet Society in 1991, under the auspices
  of Kahn's Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) and the leadership
  of Cerf, then with CNRI.\nIn 1992, yet another reorganization took place. In 1992,
  the Internet Activities Board was re-organized and re-named the Internet Architecture
  Board operating under the auspices of the Internet Society. A more \"peer\" relationship
  was defined between the new IAB and IESG, with the IETF and IESG taking a larger
  responsibility for the approval of standards. Ultimately, a cooperative and mutually
  supportive relationship was formed between the IAB, IETF, and Internet Society,
  with the Internet Society taking on as a goal the provision of service and other
  measures which would facilitate the work of the IETF.\nThe recent development and
  widespread deployment of the World Wide Web has brought with it a new community,
  as many of the people working on the WWW have not thought of themselves as primarily
  network researchers and developers. A new coordination organization was formed,
  the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Initially led from MIT's Laboratory for Computer
  Science by Tim Berners-Lee (the inventor of the WWW) and Al Vezza, W3C has taken
  on the responsibility for evolving the various protocols and standards associated
  with the Web.\nThus, through the over two decades of Internet activity, we have
  seen a steady evolution of organizational structures designed to support and facilitate
  an ever-increasing community working collaboratively on Internet issues.\nCommercialization
  of the Technology\nCommercialization of the Internet involved not only the development
  of competitive, private network services, but also the development of commercial
  products implementing the Internet technology. In the early 1980s, dozens of vendors
  were incorporating TCP/IP into their products because they saw buyers for that approach
  to networking. Unfortunately they lacked both real information about how the technology
  was supposed to work and how the customers planned on using this approach to networking.
  Many saw it as a nuisance add-on that had to be glued on to their own proprietary
  networking solutions: SNA, DECNet, Netware, NetBios. The DoD had mandated the use
  of TCP/IP in many of its purchases but gave little help to the vendors regarding
  how to build useful TCP/IP products.\nIn 1985, recognizing this lack of information
  availability and appropriate training, Dan Lynch in cooperation with the IAB arranged
  to hold a three day workshop for ALL vendors to come learn about how TCP/IP worked
  and what it still could not do well. The speakers came mostly from the DARPA research
  community who had both developed these protocols and used them in day-to-day work.
  About 250 vendor personnel came to listen to 50 inventors and experimenters. The
  results were surprises on both sides: the vendors were amazed to find that the inventors
  were so open about the way things worked (and what still did not work) and the inventors
  were pleased to listen to new problems they had not considered, but were being discovered
  by the vendors in the field. Thus a two-way discussion was formed that has lasted
  for over a decade.\nAfter two years of conferences, tutorials, design meetings and
  workshops, a special event was organized that invited those vendors whose products
  ran TCP/IP well enough to come together in one room for three days to show off how
  well they all worked together and also ran over the Internet. In September of 1988
  the first Interop trade show was born. 50 companies made the cut. 5,000 engineers
  from potential customer organizations came to see if it all did work as was promised.
  It did. Why? Because the vendors worked extremely hard to ensure that everyone's
  products interoperated with all of the other products - even with those of their
  competitors. The Interop trade show has grown immensely since then and today it
  is held in 7 locations around the world each year to an audience of over 250,000
  people who come to learn which products work with each other in a seamless manner,
  learn about the latest products, and discuss the latest technology.\nIn parallel
  with the commercialization efforts that were highlighted by the Interop activities,
  the vendors began to attend the IETF meetings that were held 3 or 4 times a year
  to discuss new ideas for extensions of the TCP/IP protocol suite. Starting with
  a few hundred attendees mostly from academia and paid for by the government, these
  meetings now often exceed a thousand attendees, mostly from the vendor community
  and paid for by the attendees themselves. This self-selected group evolves the TCP/IP
  suite in a mutually cooperative manner. The reason it is so useful is that it is
  composed of all stakeholders: researchers, end users and vendors.\nNetwork management
  provides an example of the interplay between the research and commercial communities.
  In the beginning of the Internet, the emphasis was on defining and implementing
  protocols that achieved interoperation.\nAs the network grew larger, it became clear
  that the sometime ad hoc procedures used to manage the network would not scale.
  Manual configuration of tables was replaced by distributed automated algorithms,
  and better tools were devised to isolate faults. In 1987 it became clear that a
  protocol was needed that would permit the elements of the network, such as the routers,
  to be remotely managed in a uniform way. Several protocols for this purpose were
  proposed, including Simple Network Management Protocol or SNMP (designed, as its
  name would suggest, for simplicity, and derived from an earlier proposal called
  SGMP) , HEMS (a more complex design from the research community) and CMIP (from
  the OSI community). A series of meeting led to the decisions that HEMS would be
  withdrawn as a candidate for standardization, in order to help resolve the contention,
  but that work on both SNMP and CMIP would go forward, with the idea that the SNMP
  could be a more near-term solution and CMIP a longer-term approach. The market could
  choose the one it found more suitable. SNMP is now used almost universally for network-based
  management.\nIn the last few years, we have seen a new phase of commercialization.
  Originally, commercial efforts mainly comprised vendors providing the basic networking
  products, and service providers offering the connectivity and basic Internet services.
  The Internet has now become almost a \"commodity\" service, and much of the latest
  attention has been on the use of this global information infrastructure for support
  of other commercial services. This has been tremendously accelerated by the widespread
  and rapid adoption of browsers and the World Wide Web technology, allowing users
  easy access to information linked throughout the globe. Products are available to
  facilitate the provisioning of that information and many of the latest developments
  in technology have been aimed at providing increasingly sophisticated information
  services on top of the basic Internet data communications.\nHistory of the Future\nOn
  October 24, 1995, the FNC unanimously passed a resolution defining the term Internet.
  This definition was developed in consultation with members of the internet and intellectual
  property rights communities. RESOLUTION: The Federal Networking Council (FNC) agrees
  that the following language reflects our definition of the term \"Internet\". \"Internet\"
  refers to the global information system that -- (i) is logically linked together
  by a globally unique address space based on the Internet Protocol (IP) or its subsequent
  extensions/follow-ons; (ii) is able to support communications using the Transmission
  Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons,
  and/or other IP-compatible protocols; and (iii) provides, uses or makes accessible,
  either publicly or privately, high level services layered on the communications
  and related infrastructure described herein.\nThe Internet has changed much in the
  two decades since it came into existence. It was conceived in the era of time-sharing,
  but has survived into the era of personal computers, client-server and peer-to-peer
  computing, and the network computer. It was designed before LANs existed, but has
  accommodated that new network technology, as well as the more recent ATM and frame
  switched services. It was envisioned as supporting a range of functions from file
  sharing and remote login to resource sharing and collaboration, and has spawned
  electronic mail and more recently the World Wide Web. But most important, it started
  as the creation of a small band of dedicated researchers, and has grown to be a
  commercial success with billions of dollars of annual investment.\nOne should not
  conclude that the Internet has now finished changing. The Internet, although a network
  in name and geography, is a creature of the computer, not the traditional network
  of the telephone or television industry. It will, indeed it must, continue to change
  and evolve at the speed of the computer industry if it is to remain relevant. It
  is now changing to provide new services such as real time transport, in order to
  support, for example, audio and video streams.\nThe availability of pervasive networking
  (i.e., the Internet) along with powerful affordable computing and communications
  in portable form (i.e., laptop computers, two-way pagers, PDAs, cellular phones),
  is making possible a new paradigm of nomadic computing and communications. This
  evolution will bring us new applications - Internet telephone and, slightly further
  out, Internet television. It is evolving to permit more sophisticated forms of pricing
  and cost recovery, a perhaps painful requirement in this commercial world. It is
  changing to accommodate yet another generation of underlying network technologies
  with different characteristics and requirements, e.g. broadband residential access
  and satellites. New modes of access and new forms of service will spawn new applications,
  which in turn will drive further evolution of the net itself.\nThe most pressing
  question for the future of the Internet is not how the technology will change, but
  how the process of change and evolution itself will be managed. As this paper describes,
  the architecture of the Internet has always been driven by a core group of designers,
  but the form of that group has changed as the number of interested parties has grown.
  With the success of the Internet has come a proliferation of stakeholders - stakeholders
  now with an economic as well as an intellectual investment in the network.\nWe now
  see, in the debates over control of the domain name space and the form of the next
  generation IP addresses, a struggle to find the next social structure that will
  guide the Internet in the future. The form of that structure will be harder to find,
  given the large number of concerned stakeholders. At the same time, the industry
  struggles to find the economic rationale for the large investment needed for the
  future growth, for example to upgrade residential access to a more suitable technology.
  If the Internet stumbles, it will not be because we lack for technology, vision,
  or motivation. It will be because we cannot set a direction and march collectively
  into the future.\n Timeline\nFootnotes\n1 Perhaps this is an exaggeration based

  DARPA in 1996. We refer throughout to DARPA, the current name.5 It was from the
  RAND study that the false rumor started claiming that the ARPANET was somehow related
  to building a network resistant to nuclear war. This was never true of the ARPANET,
  only the unrelated RAND study on secure voice considered nuclear war. However, the
  later work on Internetting did emphasize robustness and survivability, including
  the capability to withstand losses of large portions of the underlying networks.6

  Postel, Larry G. Roberts, Stephen WolffThe Internet has revolutionized the computer
  and communications world like nothing before. The invention of the telegraph, telephone,
  radio, and computer set the stage for this unprecedented integration of capabilities.
  The Internet is at once a world-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism for information
  dissemination, and a medium for collaboration and interaction between individuals
  and their computers without regard for geographic location. The Internet represents
  one of the most successful examples of the benefits of sustained investment and
  commitment to research and development of information infrastructure. Beginning
  with the early research in packet switching, the government, industry and academia
  have been partners in evolving and deploying this exciting new technology. Today,
  terms like \"bleiner@computer.org\" and \"http://www.acm.org\" trip lightly off
  the tongue of the random person on the street. 1This is intended to be a brief,
  necessarily cursory and incomplete history. Much material currently exists about
  the Internet, covering history, technology, and usage. A trip to almost any bookstore
  will find shelves of material written about the Internet. 2In this paper,3 several
  of us involved in the development and evolution of the Internet share our views
  of its origins and history. This history revolves around four distinct aspects.
  There is the technological evolution that began with early research on packet switching
  and the ARPANET (and related technologies), and where current research continues
  to expand the horizons of the infrastructure along several dimensions, such as scale,
  performance, and higher-level functionality. There is the operations and management
  aspect of a global and complex operational infrastructure. There is the social aspect,
  which resulted in a broad community of Internauts working together to create and
  evolve the technology. And there is the commercialization aspect, resulting in an
  extremely effective transition of research results into a broadly deployed and available
  information infrastructure.The Internet today is a widespread information infrastructure,
  the initial prototype of what is often called the National (or Global or Galactic)
  Information Infrastructure. Its history is complex and involves many aspects - technological,
  organizational, and community. And its influence reaches not only to the technical
  fields of computer communications but throughout society as we move toward increasing
  use of online tools to accomplish electronic commerce, information acquisition,
  and community operations.The first recorded description of the social interactions
  that could be enabled through networking was a series of memos written by J.C.R.
  Licklider of MIT in August 1962 discussing his \"Galactic Network\" concept. He
  envisioned a globally interconnected set of computers through which everyone could
  quickly access data and programs from any site. In spirit, the concept was very
  much like the Internet of today. Licklider was the first head of the computer research
  program at DARPA,4 starting in October 1962. While at DARPA he convinced his successors
  at DARPA, Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and MIT researcher Lawrence G. Roberts, of
  the importance of this networking concept.Leonard Kleinrock at MIT published the
  first paper on packet switching theory in July 1961 and the first book on the subject
  in 1964. Kleinrock convinced Roberts of the theoretical feasibility of communications
  using packets rather than circuits, which was a major step along the path towards
  computer networking. The other key step was to make the computers talk together.
  To explore this, in 1965 working with Thomas Merrill, Roberts connected the TX-2
  computer in Mass. to the Q-32 in California with a low speed dial-up telephone line
  creating the first (however small) wide-area computer network ever built. The result
  of this experiment was the realization that the time-shared computers could work
  well together, running programs and retrieving data as necessary on the remote machine,
  but that the circuit switched telephone system was totally inadequate for the job.
  Kleinrock's conviction of the need for packet switching was confirmed.In late 1966
  Roberts went to DARPA to develop the computer network concept and quickly put together
  his plan for the \"ARPANET\", publishing it in 1967. At the conference where he
  presented the paper, there was also a paper on a packet network concept from the
  UK by Donald Davies and Roger Scantlebury of NPL. Scantlebury told Roberts about
  the NPL work as well as that of Paul Baran and others at RAND. The RAND group had
  written a paper on packet switching networks for secure voice in the military in
  1964. It happened that the work at MIT (1961-1967), at RAND (1962-1965), and at
  NPL (1964-1967) had all proceeded in parallel without any of the researchers knowing
  about the other work. The word \"packet\" was adopted from the work at NPL and the
  proposed line speed to be used in the ARPANET design was upgraded from 2.4 kbps
  to 50 kbps. 5In August 1968, after Roberts and the DARPA funded community had refined
  the overall structure and specifications for the ARPANET, an RFQ was released by
  DARPA for the development of one of the key components, the packet switches called
  Interface Message Processors (IMP's). The RFQ was won in December 1968 by a group
  headed by Frank Heart at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN). As the BBN team worked on
  the IMP's with Bob Kahn playing a major role in the overall ARPANET architectural
  design, the network topology and economics were designed and optimized by Roberts
  working with Howard Frank and his team at Network Analysis Corporation, and the
  network measurement system was prepared by Kleinrock's team at UCLA. 6Due to Kleinrock's
  early development of packet switching theory and his focus on analysis, design and
  measurement, his Network Measurement Center at UCLA was selected to be the first
  node on the ARPANET. All this came together in September 1969 when BBN installed
  the first IMP at UCLA and the first host computer was connected. Doug Engelbart's
  project on \"Augmentation of Human Intellect\" (which included NLS, an early hypertext
  system) at Stanford Research Institute (SRI) provided a second node. SRI supported
  the Network Information Center, led by Elizabeth (Jake) Feinler and including functions
  such as maintaining tables of host name to address mapping as well as a directory
  of the RFC's.One month later, when SRI was connected to the ARPANET, the first host-to-host
  message was sent from Kleinrock's laboratory to SRI. Two more nodes were added at
  UC Santa Barbara and University of Utah. These last two nodes incorporated application
  visualization projects, with Glen Culler and Burton Fried at UCSB investigating
  methods for display of mathematical functions using storage displays to deal with
  the problem of refresh over the net, and Robert Taylor and Ivan Sutherland at Utah
  investigating methods of 3-D representations over the net. Thus, by the end of 1969,
  four host computers were connected together into the initial ARPANET, and the budding
  Internet was off the ground. Even at this early stage, it should be noted that the
  networking research incorporated both work on the underlying network and work on
  how to utilize the network. This tradition continues to this day.Computers were
  added quickly to the ARPANET during the following years, and work proceeded on completing
  a functionally complete Host-to-Host protocol and other network software. In December
  1970 the Network Working Group (NWG) working under S. Crocker finished the initial
  ARPANET Host-to-Host protocol, called the Network Control Protocol (NCP). As the
  ARPANET sites completed implementing NCP during the period 1971-1972, the network
  users finally could begin to develop applications.In October 1972, Kahn organized
  a large, very successful demonstration of the ARPANET at the International Computer
  Communication Conference (ICCC). This was the first public demonstration of this
  new network technology to the public. It was also in 1972 that the initial \"hot\"
  application, electronic mail, was introduced. In March Ray Tomlinson at BBN wrote
  the basic email message send and read software, motivated by the need of the ARPANET
  developers for an easy coordination mechanism. In July, Roberts expanded its utility
  by writing the first email utility program to list, selectively read, file, forward,
  and respond to messages. From there email took off as the largest network application
  for over a decade. This was a harbinger of the kind of activity we see on the World
  Wide Web today, namely, the enormous growth of all kinds of \"people-to-people\"
  traffic.The original ARPANET grew into the Internet. Internet was based on the idea
  that there would be multiple independent networks of rather arbitrary design, beginning
  with the ARPANET as the pioneering packet switching network, but soon to include
  packet satellite networks, ground-based packet radio networks and other networks.
  The Internet as we now know it embodies a key underlying technical idea, namely
  that of open architecture networking. In this approach, the choice of any individual
  network technology was not dictated by a particular network architecture but rather
  could be selected freely by a provider and made to interwork with the other networks
  through a meta-level \"Internetworking Architecture\". Up until that time there
  was only one general method for federating networks. This was the traditional circuit
  switching method where networks would interconnect at the circuit level, passing
  individual bits on a synchronous basis along a portion of an end-to-end circuit
  between a pair of end locations. Recall that Kleinrock had shown in 1961 that packet
  switching was a more efficient switching method. Along with packet switching, special
  purpose interconnection arrangements between networks were another possibility.
  While there were other limited ways to interconnect different networks, they required
  that one be used as a component of the other, rather than acting as a peer of the
  other in offering end-to-end service.In an open-architecture network, the individual
  networks may be separately designed and developed and each may have its own unique
  interface which it may offer to users and/or other providers. including other Internet
  providers. Each network can be designed in accordance with the specific environment
  and user requirements of that network. There are generally no constraints on the
  types of network that can be included or on their geographic scope, although certain
  pragmatic considerations will dictate what makes sense to offer.The idea of open-architecture
  networking was first introduced by Kahn shortly after having arrived at DARPA in
  1972. This work was originally part of the packet radio program, but subsequently
  became a separate program in its own right. At the time, the program was called
  \"Internetting\". Key to making the packet radio system work was a reliable end-end
  protocol that could maintain effective communication in the face of jamming and
  other radio interference, or withstand intermittent blackout such as caused by being
  in a tunnel or blocked by the local terrain. Kahn first contemplated developing
  a protocol local only to the packet radio network, since that would avoid having
  to deal with the multitude of different operating systems, and continuing to use
  NCP.However, NCP did not have the ability to address networks (and machines) further
  downstream than a destination IMP on the ARPANET and thus some change to NCP would
  also be required. (The assumption was that the ARPANET was not changeable in this
  regard). NCP relied on ARPANET to provide end-to-end reliability. If any packets
  were lost, the protocol (and presumably any applications it supported) would come
  to a grinding halt. In this model NCP had no end-end host error control, since the
  ARPANET was to be the only network in existence and it would be so reliable that
  no error control would be required on the part of the hosts. Thus, Kahn decided
  to develop a new version of the protocol which could meet the needs of an open-architecture
  network environment. This protocol would eventually be called the Transmission Control
  Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). While NCP tended to act like a device driver,
  the new protocol would be more like a communications protocol.Four ground rules
  were critical to Kahn's early thinking:Other key issues that needed to be addressed
  were:Kahn began work on a communications-oriented set of operating system principles
  while at BBN and documented some of his early thoughts in an internal BBN memorandum
  entitled \"Communications Principles for Operating Systems\". At this point he realized
  it would be necessary to learn the implementation details of each operating system
  to have a chance to embed any new protocols in an efficient way. Thus, in the spring
  of 1973, after starting the internetting effort, he asked Vint Cerf (then at Stanford)
  to work with him on the detailed design of the protocol. Cerf had been intimately
  involved in the original NCP design and development and already had the knowledge
  about interfacing to existing operating systems. So armed with Kahn's architectural
  approach to the communications side and with Cerf's NCP experience, they teamed
  up to spell out the details of what became TCP/IP.The give and take was highly productive
  and the first written version7 of the resulting approach was distributed at a special
  meeting of the International Network Working Group (INWG) which had been set up
  at a conference at Sussex University in September 1973. Cerf had been invited to
  chair this group and used the occasion to hold a meeting of INWG members who were
  heavily represented at the Sussex Conference.Some basic approaches emerged from
  this collaboration between Kahn and Cerf:The original Cerf/Kahn paper on the Internet
  described one protocol, called TCP, which provided all the transport and forwarding
  services in the Internet. Kahn had intended that the TCP protocol support a range
  of transport services, from the totally reliable sequenced delivery of data (virtual
  circuit model) to a datagram service in which the application made direct use of
  the underlying network service, which might imply occasional lost, corrupted or
  reordered packets. However, the initial effort to implement TCP resulted in a version
  that only allowed for virtual circuits. This model worked fine for file transfer
  and remote login applications, but some of the early work on advanced network applications,
  in particular packet voice in the 1970s, made clear that in some cases packet losses
  should not be corrected by TCP, but should be left to the application to deal with.
  This led to a reorganization of the original TCP into two protocols, the simple
  IP which provided only for addressing and forwarding of individual packets, and
  the separate TCP, which was concerned with service features such as flow control
  and recovery from lost packets. For those applications that did not want the services
  of TCP, an alternative called the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) was added in order
  to provide direct access to the basic service of IP.A major initial motivation for
  both the ARPANET and the Internet was resource sharing - for example allowing users
  on the packet radio networks to access the time sharing systems attached to the
  ARPANET. Connecting the two together was far more economical that duplicating these
  very expensive computers. However, while file transfer and remote login (Telnet)
  were very important applications, electronic mail has probably had the most significant
  impact of the innovations from that era. Email provided a new model of how people
  could communicate with each other, and changed the nature of collaboration, first
  in the building of the Internet itself (as is discussed below) and later for much
  of society.There were other applications proposed in the early days of the Internet,
  including packet based voice communication (the precursor of Internet telephony),
  various models of file and disk sharing, and early \"worm\" programs that showed
  the concept of agents (and, of course, viruses). A key concept of the Internet is
  that it was not designed for just one application, but as a general infrastructure
  on which new applications could be conceived, as illustrated later by the emergence
  of the World Wide Web. It is the general purpose nature of the service provided
  by TCP and IP that makes this possible.DARPA let three contracts to Stanford (Cerf),
  BBN (Ray Tomlinson) and UCL (Peter Kirstein) to implement TCP/IP (it was simply
  called TCP in the Cerf/Kahn paper but contained both components). The Stanford team,
  led by Cerf, produced the detailed specification and within about a year there were
  three independent implementations of TCP that could interoperate.This was the beginning
  of long term experimentation and development to evolve and mature the Internet concepts
  and technology. Beginning with the first three networks (ARPANET, Packet Radio,
  and Packet Satellite) and their initial research communities, the experimental environment
  has grown to incorporate essentially every form of network and a very broad-based
  research and development community. [REK78] With each expansion has come new challenges.The
  early implementations of TCP were done for large time sharing systems such as Tenex
  and TOPS 20. When desktop computers first appeared, it was thought by some that
  TCP was too big and complex to run on a personal computer. David Clark and his research
  group at MIT set out to show that a compact and simple implementation of TCP was
  possible. They produced an implementation, first for the Xerox Alto (the early personal
  workstation developed at Xerox PARC) and then for the IBM PC. That implementation
  was fully interoperable with other TCPs, but was tailored to the application suite
  and performance objectives of the personal computer, and showed that workstations,
  as well as large time-sharing systems, could be a part of the Internet. In 1976,
  Kleinrock published the first book on the ARPANET. It included an emphasis on the
  complexity of protocols and the pitfalls they often introduce. This book was influential
  in spreading the lore of packet switching networks to a very wide community.Widespread
  development of LANS, PCs and workstations in the 1980s allowed the nascent Internet
  to flourish. Ethernet technology, developed by Bob Metcalfe at Xerox PARC in 1973,
  is now probably the dominant network technology in the Internet and PCs and workstations
  the dominant computers. This change from having a few networks with a modest number
  of time-shared hosts (the original ARPANET model) to having many networks has resulted
  in a number of new concepts and changes to the underlying technology. First, it
  resulted in the definition of three network classes (A, B, and C) to accommodate
  the range of networks. Class A represented large national scale networks (small
  number of networks with large numbers of hosts); Class B represented regional scale
  networks; and Class C represented local area networks (large number of networks
  with relatively few hosts).A major shift occurred as a result of the increase in
  scale of the Internet and its associated management issues. To make it easy for
  people to use the network, hosts were assigned names, so that it was not necessary
  to remember the numeric addresses. Originally, there were a fairly limited number
  of hosts, so it was feasible to maintain a single table of all the hosts and their
  associated names and addresses. The shift to having a large number of independently
  managed networks (e.g., LANs) meant that having a single table of hosts was no longer
  feasible, and the Domain Name System (DNS) was invented by Paul Mockapetris of USC/ISI.
  The DNS permitted a scalable distributed mechanism for resolving hierarchical host
  names (e.g. www.acm.org) into an Internet address.The increase in the size of the
  Internet also challenged the capabilities of the routers. Originally, there was
  a single distributed algorithm for routing that was implemented uniformly by all
  the routers in the Internet. As the number of networks in the Internet exploded,
  this initial design could not expand as necessary, so it was replaced by a hierarchical
  model of routing, with an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) used inside each region
  of the Internet, and an Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) used to tie the regions
  together. This design permitted different regions to use a different IGP, so that
  different requirements for cost, rapid reconfiguration, robustness and scale could
  be accommodated. Not only the routing algorithm, but the size of the addressing
  tables, stressed the capacity of the routers. New approaches for address aggregation,
  in particular classless inter-domain routing (CIDR), have recently been introduced
  to control the size of router tables.As the Internet evolved, one of the major challenges
  was how to propagate the changes to the software, particularly the host software.
  DARPA supported UC Berkeley to investigate modifications to the Unix operating system,
  including incorporating TCP/IP developed at BBN. Although Berkeley later rewrote
  the BBN code to more efficiently fit into the Unix system and kernel, the incorporation
  of TCP/IP into the Unix BSD system releases proved to be a critical element in dispersion
  of the protocols to the research community. Much of the CS research community began
  to use Unix BSD for their day-to-day computing environment. Looking back, the strategy
  of incorporating Internet protocols into a supported operating system for the research
  community was one of the key elements in the successful widespread adoption of the
  Internet.One of the more interesting challenges was the transition of the ARPANET
  host protocol from NCP to TCP/IP as of January 1, 1983. This was a \"flag-day\"
  style transition, requiring all hosts to convert simultaneously or be left having
  to communicate via rather ad-hoc mechanisms. This transition was carefully planned
  within the community over several years before it actually took place and went surprisingly
  smoothly (but resulted in a distribution of buttons saying \"I survived the TCP/IP
  transition\").TCP/IP was adopted as a defense standard three years earlier in 1980.
  This enabled defense to begin sharing in the DARPA Internet technology base and
  led directly to the eventual partitioning of the military and non- military communities.
  By 1983, ARPANET was being used by a significant number of defense R&D and operational
  organizations. The transition of ARPANET from NCP to TCP/IP permitted it to be split
  into a MILNET supporting operational requirements and an ARPANET supporting research
  needs.Thus, by 1985, Internet was already well established as a technology supporting
  a broad community of researchers and developers, and was beginning to be used by
  other communities for daily computer communications. Electronic mail was being used
  broadly across several communities, often with different systems, but interconnection
  between different mail systems was demonstrating the utility of broad based electronic
  communications between people.At the same time that the Internet technology was
  being experimentally validated and widely used amongst a subset of computer science
  researchers, other networks and networking technologies were being pursued. The
  usefulness of computer networking - especially electronic mail - demonstrated by
  DARPA and Department of Defense contractors on the ARPANET was not lost on other
  communities and disciplines, so that by the mid-1970s computer networks had begun
  to spring up wherever funding could be found for the purpose. The U.S. Department
  of Energy (DoE) established MFENet for its researchers in Magnetic Fusion Energy,
  whereupon DoE's High Energy Physicists responded by building HEPNet. NASA Space
  Physicists followed with SPAN, and Rick Adrion, David Farber, and Larry Landweber
  established CSNET for the (academic and industrial) Computer Science community with
  an initial grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF). AT&T's free-wheeling
  dissemination of the UNIX computer operating system spawned USENET, based on UNIX'
  built-in UUCP communication protocols, and in 1981 Ira Fuchs and Greydon Freeman
  devised BITNET, which linked academic mainframe computers in an \"email as card
  images\" paradigm.With the exception of BITNET and USENET, these early networks
  (including ARPANET) were purpose-built - i.e., they were intended for, and largely
  restricted to, closed communities of scholars; there was hence little pressure for
  the individual networks to be compatible and, indeed, they largely were not. In
  addition, alternate technologies were being pursued in the commercial sector, including
  XNS from Xerox, DECNet, and IBM's SNA.8 It remained for the British JANET (1984)
  and U.S. NSFNET (1985) programs to explicitly announce their intent to serve the
  entire higher education community, regardless of discipline. Indeed, a condition
  for a U.S. university to receive NSF funding for an Internet connection was that
  \"... the connection must be made available to ALL qualified users on campus.\"In
  1985, Dennis Jennings came from Ireland to spend a year at NSF leading the NSFNET
  program. He worked with the community to help NSF make a critical decision - that
  TCP/IP would be mandatory for the NSFNET program. When Steve Wolff took over the
  NSFNET program in 1986, he recognized the need for a wide area networking infrastructure
  to support the general academic and research community, along with the need to develop
  a strategy for establishing such infrastructure on a basis ultimately independent
  of direct federal funding. Policies and strategies were adopted (see below) to achieve
  that end.NSF also elected to support DARPA's existing Internet organizational infrastructure,
  hierarchically arranged under the (then) Internet Activities Board (IAB). The public
  declaration of this choice was the joint authorship by the IAB's Internet Engineering
  and Architecture Task Forces and by NSF's Network Technical Advisory Group of RFC
  985 (Requirements for Internet Gateways ), which formally ensured interoperability
  of DARPA's and NSF's pieces of the Internet.In addition to the selection of TCP/IP
  for the NSFNET program, Federal agencies made and implemented several other policy
  decisions which shaped the Internet of today.The backbone had made the transition
  from a network built from routers out of the research community (the \"Fuzzball\"
  routers from David Mills) to commercial equipment. In its 8 1/2 year lifetime, the
  Backbone had grown from six nodes with 56 kbps links to 21 nodes with multiple 45
  Mbps links. It had seen the Internet grow to over 50,000 networks on all seven continents
  and outer space, with approximately 29,000 networks in the United States.Such was
  the weight of the NSFNET program's ecumenism and funding ($200 million from 1986
  to 1995) - and the quality of the protocols themselves - that by 1990 when the ARPANET
  itself was finally decommissioned10, TCP/IP had supplanted or marginalized most
  other wide-area computer network protocols worldwide, and IP was well on its way
  to becoming THE bearer service for the Global Information Infrastructure.A key to
  the rapid growth of the Internet has been the free and open access to the basic
  documents, especially the specifications of the protocols.The beginnings of the
  ARPANET and the Internet in the university research community promoted the academic
  tradition of open publication of ideas and results. However, the normal cycle of
  traditional academic publication was too formal and too slow for the dynamic exchange
  of ideas essential to creating networks.In 1969 a key step was taken by S. Crocker
  (then at UCLA) in establishing the Request for Comments (or RFC) series of notes.
  These memos were intended to be an informal fast distribution way to share ideas
  with other network researchers. At first the RFCs were printed on paper and distributed
  via snail mail. As the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) came into use, the RFCs were
  prepared as online files and accessed via FTP. Now, of course, the RFCs are easily
  accessed via the World Wide Web at dozens of sites around the world. SRI, in its
  role as Network Information Center, maintained the online directories. Jon Postel
  acted as RFC Editor as well as managing the centralized administration of required
  protocol number assignments, roles that he continued to play until his death, October
  16, 1998.The effect of the RFCs was to create a positive feedback loop, with ideas
  or proposals presented in one RFC triggering another RFC with additional ideas,
  and so on. When some consensus (or a least a consistent set of ideas) had come together
  a specification document would be prepared. Such a specification would then be used
  as the base for implementations by the various research teams.Over time, the RFCs
  have become more focused on protocol standards (the \"official\" specifications),
  though there are still informational RFCs that describe alternate approaches, or
  provide background information on protocols and engineering issues. The RFCs are
  now viewed as the \"documents of record\" in the Internet engineering and standards
  community.The open access to the RFCs (for free, if you have any kind of a connection
  to the Internet) promotes the growth of the Internet because it allows the actual
  specifications to be used for examples in college classes and by entrepreneurs developing
  new systems.Email has been a significant factor in all areas of the Internet, and
  that is certainly true in the development of protocol specifications, technical
  standards, and Internet engineering. The very early RFCs often presented a set of
  ideas developed by the researchers at one location to the rest of the community.
  After email came into use, the authorship pattern changed - RFCs were presented
  by joint authors with common view independent of their locations.The use of specialized
  email mailing lists has been long used in the development of protocol specifications,
  and continues to be an important tool. The IETF now has in excess of 75 working
  groups, each working on a different aspect of Internet engineering. Each of these
  working groups has a mailing list to discuss one or more draft documents under development.
  When consensus is reached on a draft document it may be distributed as an RFC.As
  the current rapid expansion of the Internet is fueled by the realization of its
  capability to promote information sharing, we should understand that the network's
  first role in information sharing was sharing the information about its own design
  and operation through the RFC documents. This unique method for evolving new capabilities
  in the network will continue to be critical to future evolution of the Internet.The
  Internet is as much a collection of communities as a collection of technologies,
  and its success is largely attributable to both satisfying basic community needs
  as well as utilizing the community in an effective way to push the infrastructure
  forward. This community spirit has a long history beginning with the early ARPANET.
  The early ARPANET researchers worked as a close-knit community to accomplish the
  initial demonstrations of packet switching technology described earlier. Likewise,
  the Packet Satellite, Packet Radio and several other DARPA computer science research
  programs were multi-contractor collaborative activities that heavily used whatever
  available mechanisms there were to coordinate their efforts, starting with electronic
  mail and adding file sharing, remote access, and eventually World Wide Web capabilities.
  Each of these programs formed a working group, starting with the ARPANET Network
  Working Group. Because of the unique role that ARPANET played as an infrastructure
  supporting the various research programs, as the Internet started to evolve, the
  Network Working Group evolved into Internet Working Group.In the late 1970s, recognizing
  that the growth of the Internet was accompanied by a growth in the size of the interested
  research community and therefore an increased need for coordination mechanisms,
  Vint Cerf, then manager of the Internet Program at DARPA, formed several coordination
  bodies - an International Cooperation Board (ICB), chaired by Peter Kirstein of
  UCL, to coordinate activities with some cooperating European countries centered
  on Packet Satellite research, an Internet Research Group which was an inclusive
  group providing an environment for general exchange of information, and an Internet
  Configuration Control Board (ICCB), chaired by Clark. The ICCB was an invitational
  body to assist Cerf in managing the burgeoning Internet activity.In 1983, when Barry
  Leiner took over management of the Internet research program at DARPA, he and Clark
  recognized that the continuing growth of the Internet community demanded a restructuring
  of the coordination mechanisms. The ICCB was disbanded and in its place a structure
  of Task Forces was formed, each focused on a particular area of the technology (e.g.
  routers, end-to-end protocols, etc.). The Internet Activities Board (IAB) was formed
  from the chairs of the Task Forces.It of course was only a coincidence that the
  chairs of the Task Forces were the same people as the members of the old ICCB, and
  Dave Clark continued to act as chair. After some changing membership on the IAB,
  Phill Gross became chair of a revitalized Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),
  at the time merely one of the IAB Task Forces. As we saw above, by 1985 there was
  a tremendous growth in the more practical/engineering side of the Internet. This
  growth resulted in an explosion in the attendance at the IETF meetings, and Gross
  was compelled to create substructure to the IETF in the form of working groups.This
  growth was complemented by a major expansion in the community. No longer was DARPA
  the only major player in the funding of the Internet. In addition to NSFNet and
  the various US and international government-funded activities, interest in the commercial
  sector was beginning to grow. Also in 1985, both Kahn and Leiner left DARPA and
  there was a significant decrease in Internet activity at DARPA. As a result, the
  IAB was left without a primary sponsor and increasingly assumed the mantle of leadership.The
  growth continued, resulting in even further substructure within both the IAB and
  IETF. The IETF combined Working Groups into Areas, and designated Area Directors.
  An Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) was formed of the Area Directors.
  The IAB recognized the increasing importance of the IETF, and restructured the standards
  process to explicitly recognize the IESG as the major review body for standards.
  The IAB also restructured so that the rest of the Task Forces (other than the IETF)
  were combined into an Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) chaired by Postel, with
  the old task forces renamed as research groups.The growth in the commercial sector
  brought with it increased concern regarding the standards process itself. Starting
  in the early 1980's and continuing to this day, the Internet grew beyond its primarily
  research roots to include both a broad user community and increased commercial activity.
  Increased attention was paid to making the process open and fair. This coupled with
  a recognized need for community support of the Internet eventually led to the formation
  of the Internet Society in 1991, under the auspices of Kahn's Corporation for National
  Research Initiatives (CNRI) and the leadership of Cerf, then with CNRI.In 1992,
  yet another reorganization took place. In 1992, the Internet Activities Board was
  re-organized and re-named the Internet Architecture Board operating under the auspices
  of the Internet Society. A more \"peer\" relationship was defined between the new
  IAB and IESG, with the IETF and IESG taking a larger responsibility for the approval
  of standards. Ultimately, a cooperative and mutually supportive relationship was
  formed between the IAB, IETF, and Internet Society, with the Internet Society taking
  on as a goal the provision of service and other measures which would facilitate
  the work of the IETF.The recent development and widespread deployment of the World
  Wide Web has brought with it a new community, as many of the people working on the
  WWW have not thought of themselves as primarily network researchers and developers.
  A new coordination organization was formed, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
  Initially led from MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science by Tim Berners-Lee (the
  inventor of the WWW) and Al Vezza, W3C has taken on the responsibility for evolving
  the various protocols and standards associated with the Web.Thus, through the over
  two decades of Internet activity, we have seen a steady evolution of organizational
  structures designed to support and facilitate an ever-increasing community working
  collaboratively on Internet issues.Commercialization of the Internet involved not
  only the development of competitive, private network services, but also the development
  of commercial products implementing the Internet technology. In the early 1980s,
  dozens of vendors were incorporating TCP/IP into their products because they saw
  buyers for that approach to networking. Unfortunately they lacked both real information
  about how the technology was supposed to work and how the customers planned on using
  this approach to networking. Many saw it as a nuisance add-on that had to be glued
  on to their own proprietary networking solutions: SNA, DECNet, Netware, NetBios.
  The DoD had mandated the use of TCP/IP in many of its purchases but gave little
  help to the vendors regarding how to build useful TCP/IP products.In 1985, recognizing
  this lack of information availability and appropriate training, Dan Lynch in cooperation
  with the IAB arranged to hold a three day workshop for ALL vendors to come learn
  about how TCP/IP worked and what it still could not do well. The speakers came mostly
  from the DARPA research community who had both developed these protocols and used
  them in day-to-day work. About 250 vendor personnel came to listen to 50 inventors
  and experimenters. The results were surprises on both sides: the vendors were amazed
  to find that the inventors were so open about the way things worked (and what still
  did not work) and the inventors were pleased to listen to new problems they had
  not considered, but were being discovered by the vendors in the field. Thus a two-way
  discussion was formed that has lasted for over a decade.After two years of conferences,
  tutorials, design meetings and workshops, a special event was organized that invited
  those vendors whose products ran TCP/IP well enough to come together in one room
  for three days to show off how well they all worked together and also ran over the
  Internet. In September of 1988 the first Interop trade show was born. 50 companies
  made the cut. 5,000 engineers from potential customer organizations came to see
  if it all did work as was promised. It did. Why? Because the vendors worked extremely
  hard to ensure that everyone's products interoperated with all of the other products
  - even with those of their competitors. The Interop trade show has grown immensely
  since then and today it is held in 7 locations around the world each year to an
  audience of over 250,000 people who come to learn which products work with each
  other in a seamless manner, learn about the latest products, and discuss the latest
  technology.In parallel with the commercialization efforts that were highlighted
  by the Interop activities, the vendors began to attend the IETF meetings that were
  held 3 or 4 times a year to discuss new ideas for extensions of the TCP/IP protocol
  suite. Starting with a few hundred attendees mostly from academia and paid for by
  the government, these meetings now often exceed a thousand attendees, mostly from
  the vendor community and paid for by the attendees themselves. This self-selected
  group evolves the TCP/IP suite in a mutually cooperative manner. The reason it is
  so useful is that it is composed of all stakeholders: researchers, end users and
  vendors.Network management provides an example of the interplay between the research
  and commercial communities. In the beginning of the Internet, the emphasis was on
  defining and implementing protocols that achieved interoperation.As the network
  grew larger, it became clear that the sometime ad hoc procedures used to manage
  the network would not scale. Manual configuration of tables was replaced by distributed
  automated algorithms, and better tools were devised to isolate faults. In 1987 it
  became clear that a protocol was needed that would permit the elements of the network,
  such as the routers, to be remotely managed in a uniform way. Several protocols
  for this purpose were proposed, including Simple Network Management Protocol or
  SNMP (designed, as its name would suggest, for simplicity, and derived from an earlier
  proposal called SGMP) , HEMS (a more complex design from the research community)
  and CMIP (from the OSI community). A series of meeting led to the decisions that
  HEMS would be withdrawn as a candidate for standardization, in order to help resolve
  the contention, but that work on both SNMP and CMIP would go forward, with the idea
  that the SNMP could be a more near-term solution and CMIP a longer-term approach.
  The market could choose the one it found more suitable. SNMP is now used almost
  universally for network-based management.In the last few years, we have seen a new
  phase of commercialization. Originally, commercial efforts mainly comprised vendors
  providing the basic networking products, and service providers offering the connectivity
  and basic Internet services. The Internet has now become almost a \"commodity\"
  service, and much of the latest attention has been on the use of this global information
  infrastructure for support of other commercial services. This has been tremendously
  accelerated by the widespread and rapid adoption of browsers and the World Wide
  Web technology, allowing users easy access to information linked throughout the
  globe. Products are available to facilitate the provisioning of that information
  and many of the latest developments in technology have been aimed at providing increasingly
  sophisticated information services on top of the basic Internet data communications.On
  October 24, 1995, the FNC unanimously passed a resolution defining the term Internet.
  This definition was developed in consultation with members of the internet and intellectual
  property rights communities. RESOLUTION: The Federal Networking Council (FNC) agrees
  that the following language reflects our definition of the term \"Internet\". \"Internet\"
  refers to the global information system that -- (i) is logically linked together
  by a globally unique address space based on the Internet Protocol (IP) or its subsequent
  extensions/follow-ons; (ii) is able to support communications using the Transmission
  Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons,
  and/or other IP-compatible protocols; and (iii) provides, uses or makes accessible,
  either publicly or privately, high level services layered on the communications
  and related infrastructure described herein.The Internet has changed much in the
  two decades since it came into existence. It was conceived in the era of time-sharing,
  but has survived into the era of personal computers, client-server and peer-to-peer
  computing, and the network computer. It was designed before LANs existed, but has
  accommodated that new network technology, as well as the more recent ATM and frame
  switched services. It was envisioned as supporting a range of functions from file
  sharing and remote login to resource sharing and collaboration, and has spawned
  electronic mail and more recently the World Wide Web. But most important, it started
  as the creation of a small band of dedicated researchers, and has grown to be a
  commercial success with billions of dollars of annual investment.One should not
  conclude that the Internet has now finished changing. The Internet, although a network
  in name and geography, is a creature of the computer, not the traditional network
  of the telephone or television industry. It will, indeed it must, continue to change
  and evolve at the speed of the computer industry if it is to remain relevant. It
  is now changing to provide new services such as real time transport, in order to
  support, for example, audio and video streams.The availability of pervasive networking
  (i.e., the Internet) along with powerful affordable computing and communications
  in portable form (i.e., laptop computers, two-way pagers, PDAs, cellular phones),
  is making possible a new paradigm of nomadic computing and communications. This
  evolution will bring us new applications - Internet telephone and, slightly further
  out, Internet television. It is evolving to permit more sophisticated forms of pricing
  and cost recovery, a perhaps painful requirement in this commercial world. It is
  changing to accommodate yet another generation of underlying network technologies
  with different characteristics and requirements, e.g. broadband residential access
  and satellites. New modes of access and new forms of service will spawn new applications,
  which in turn will drive further evolution of the net itself.The most pressing question
  for the future of the Internet is not how the technology will change, but how the
  process of change and evolution itself will be managed. As this paper describes,
  the architecture of the Internet has always been driven by a core group of designers,
  but the form of that group has changed as the number of interested parties has grown.
  With the success of the Internet has come a proliferation of stakeholders - stakeholders
  now with an economic as well as an intellectual investment in the network.We now
  see, in the debates over control of the domain name space and the form of the next
  generation IP addresses, a struggle to find the next social structure that will
  guide the Internet in the future. The form of that structure will be harder to find,
  given the large number of concerned stakeholders. At the same time, the industry
  struggles to find the economic rationale for the large investment needed for the
  future growth, for example to upgrade residential access to a more suitable technology.
  If the Internet stumbles, it will not be because we lack for technology, vision,
  or motivation. It will be because we cannot set a direction and march collectively
  into the future. Timeline1 Perhaps this is an exaggeration based on the lead author's
  residence in Silicon Valley.2 On a recent trip to a Tokyo bookstore, one of the
  authors counted 14 English language magazines devoted to the Internet.3 An abbreviated
  version of this article appears in the 50th anniversary issue of the CACM, Feb.
  97. The authors would like to express their appreciation to Andy Rosenbloom, CACM
  Senior Editor, for both instigating the writing of this article and his invaluable
  assistance in editing both this and the abbreviated version.4 The Advanced Research
  Projects Agency (ARPA) changed its name to Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
  (DARPA) in 1971, then back to ARPA in 1993, and back to DARPA in 1996. We refer
  throughout to DARPA, the current name.5 It was from the RAND study that the false
  rumor started claiming that the ARPANET was somehow related to building a network
  resistant to nuclear war. This was never true of the ARPANET, only the unrelated
  RAND study on secure voice considered nuclear war. However, the later work on Internetting
  did emphasize robustness and survivability, including the capability to withstand
  losses of large portions of the underlying networks.6 Including amongst others Vint
  Cerf, Steve Crocker, and Jon Postel. Joining them later were David Crocker who was
  to play an important role in documentation of electronic mail protocols, and Robert
