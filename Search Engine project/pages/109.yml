- |
  DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- "  In a letter dated November 17, 1944, President Roosevelt requested my \n"
- |
  recommendations on the following points:
- |2+

- |2
    (1) What can be done, consistent with military security, and with the prior
- |
  approval of the military authorities, to make known to the world as soon as
- |
  possible the contributions which have been made during our war effort to
- |
  scientific knowledge?
- |2+

- |2
    (2) With particular reference to the war of science against disease, what
- |
  can be done now to organize a program for continuing in the future the work
- |
  which has been done in medicine and related sciences?
- |2+

- "  (3) What can the Government do now and in the future to aid research \n"
- |
  activities by public and private organizations?
- |2+

- |2
    (4) Can an effective program be proposed for discovering and developing
- |
  scientific talent in American youth so that the continuing future of scientific
- "research in this country may be assured on a level comparable to what has \n"
- |
  been done during the war?
- |2+

- |2
    It is clear from President Roosevelt's letter that in speaking of science
- |
  that he had in mind the natural sciences, including biology and medicine,
- "and I have so interpreted his questions.  Progress in other fields, such \n"
- |
  as the social sciences and the humanities, is likewise important; but the
- |
  program for science presented in my report warrants immediate attention.
- |2+

- "  In seeking answers to President Roosevelt's questions I have had the \n"
- "assistance of distinguished committees specially qualified to advise in \n"
- |
  respect to these subjects.  The committees have given these matters the
- "serious attention they deserve; indeed, they have regarded this as an \n"
- |
  opportunity to participate in shaping the policy of the country with reference
- |
  to scientific research.  They have had many meetings and have submitted formal
- "reports.  I have been in close touch with the work of the committees and \n"
- |
  with their members throughout.  I have examined all of the data they assembled
- |
  and the suggestions they submitted on the points raised in President Roosevelt's
- |
  letter.
- |2+

- |2
    Although the report which I submit herewith is my own, the facts, conclusions,
- |
  and recommendations are based on the findings of the committees which have
- |
  studied these questions.  Since my report is necessarily brief, I am including
- |
  as appendices the full reports of the committees.
- |2+

- |2
    A single mechanism for implementing the recommendations of the several
- |
  committees is essential.  In proposing such a mechanism I have departed somewhat
- |
  from the specific recommendations of the committees, but I have since been
- |
  assured that the plan I am proposing is fully acceptable to the committee
- |
  members.
- |2+

- "  The pioneer spirit is still vigorous within this nation.  Science offers a \n"
- |
  largely unexplored hinterland for the pioneer who has the tools for his task.
- |
  The rewards of such exploration both for the Nation and the individual are
- |
  great.  Scientific progress is one essential key to our security as a nation,
- |
  to our better health, to more jobs, to a higher standard of living, and to
- |
  our cultural progress.
- |2+

- |2
    Respectfully yours,
- "\t\t\t\t\t(s) V. Bush, Director\n"
- |2+

- |2+

  THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
- |
  The White House,
- |
  Washington, D. C.

    THE WHITE HOUSE

    Washington, D. C.

    November 17, 1944
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  DEAR DR. BUSH:  The Office of Scientific Research and Development, of which
- "you are the Director, represents a unique experiment of team-work and \n"
- "cooperation in coordinating scientific research and in applying existing \n"
- |
  scientific knowledge to the solution of the technical problems paramount
- "in war.  Its work has been conducted in the utmost secrecy and carried on \n"
- |
  without public recognition of any kind; but its tangible results can be found
- |
  in the communiques coming in from the battlefronts all over the world.  Some
- |
  day the full story of its achievements can be told.
- |2+

- |2
    There is, however, no reason why the lessons to be found in this experiment
- "cannot be profitably employed in times of peace.  The information, the \n"
- |
  techniques, and the research experience developed by the Office of Scientific
- |
  Research and Development and by the thousands of scientists in the universities
- "and in private industry, should be used in the days of peace ahead for the \n"
- |
  improvement of the national health, the creation of new enterprises bringing
- |
  new jobs, and the betterment of the national standard of living.
- |2+

- "  It is with that objective in mind that I would like to have your \n"
- |
  recommendations on the following four major points:
- |2+

- |2
    First: What can be done, consistent with military security, and with the prior
- |
  approval of the military authorities, to make known to the world as soon as
- |
  possible the contributions which have been made during our war effort to
- |
  scientific knowledge?
- |2+

- |2
    The diffusion of such knowledge should help us stimulate new enterprises,
- |
  provide jobs four our returning servicemen and other workers, and make possible
- |
  great strides for the improvement of the national well-being.
- |2+

- |2
    Second: With particular reference to the war of science against disease, what
- |
  can be done now to organize a program for continuing in the future the work
- |
  which has been done in medicine and related sciences?
- |2+

- |2
    The fact that the annual deaths in this country from one or two diseases
- |
  alone are far in excess of the total number of lives lost by us in battle
- |
  during this war should make us conscious of the duty we owe future generations.
- |2+

- |2
    Third: What can the Government do now and in the future to aid research
- "activities by public and private organizations?  The proper roles of public \n"
- "and of private research, and their interrelation, should be carefully \n"
- |
  considered.
- |2+

- |2
    Fourth: Can an effective program be proposed for discovering and developing
- |
  scientific talent in American youth so that the continuing future of scientific
- |
  research in this country may be assured on a level comparable to what has
- |
  been done during the war?
- |2+

- |2
    New frontiers of the mind are before us, and if they are pioneered with the
- |
  same vision, boldness, and drive with which we have waged this war we can
- |
  create a fuller and more fruitful employment and a fuller and more fruitful

- "  SUMMARY OF THE REPORT  \n"
- |2
    ---
- "SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS IS ESSENTIAL \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |2
    Progress in the war against disease depends upon a flow of new scientific
- |
  knowledge.  New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous
- |
  additions to knowledge of the laws of nature, and the application of that
- |
  knowledge to practical purposes.  Similarly, our defense against aggression
- |
  demands new knowledge so that we can develop new and improved weapons.  This
- "essential, new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific \n"
- |
  research.
- |2+

- |2
    Science can be effective in the national welfare only as a member of a team,
- |
  whether the conditions be peace or war.   But without scientific progress no
- |
  amount of achievement in other directions can insure our health, prosperity,
- |
  and security as a nation in the modern world.
- |2+

- |2+

- " For the War Against Disease \n"
- |2+

- " \n"
- |2
    We have taken great strides in the war against disease.  The death rate for
- |
  all diseases in the Army, including overseas forces, has been reduced from 14.1
- |
  per thousand in the last war to 0.6 per thousand in this war.  In the last
- "40 years life expectancy has increased from 49 to 65 years, largely as a \n"
- |
  consequence of the reduction in the death rates of infants and children.  But
- |
  we are far from the goal.  The annual deaths from one or two diseases far
- |
  exceed the total number of American lives lost in battle during this war.
- "A large fraction of these deaths in our civilian population cut short the \n"
- |
  useful lives of our citizens.  Approximately 7,000,000 persons in the United
- |
  States are mentally ill and their care costs the public over $175,000,000 a
- |
  year.  Clearly much illness remains for which adequate means of prevention and
- |
  cure are not yet known.
- |2+

- |2
    The responsibility for basic research in medicine and the underlying sciences,
- |
  so essential to progress in the war against disease, falls primarily upon
- |
  the medical schools and universities.  Yet we find that the traditional
- |
  sources of support for medical research in the medical schools and universities,
- "largely endowment income, foundation grants, and private donations, are \n"
- "diminishing and there is no immediate prospect of a change in this trend.  \n"
- |
  Meanwhile, the cost of medical research has been rising.  If we are to maintain
- |
  the progress in medicine which has marked the last 25 years, the Government
- |
  should extend financial support to basic medical research in the medical
- |
  schools and in universities.
- |2+

- |2+

- " For Our National Security \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |2
    The bitter and dangerous battle against the U-boat was a battle of
- |
  scientific techniques - and our margin of success was dangerously small.
- |
  The new eyes which radar has supplied can sometimes be blinded by
- |
  new scientific developments. V-2 was countered only by capture of
- |
  the launching sites.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2
    We cannot again rely on our allies to hold off the enemy while we
- |
  struggle to catch up. There must be more - and more adequate - military
- |
  research in peacetime. It is essential that the civilian scientists
- |
  continue in peacetime some portion of those contributions to national
- |
  security which they have made so effectively during the war. This
- |
  can best be done through a civilian-controlled organization with close
- |
  liaison with the Army and Navy, but with funds direct from Congress, and
- |
  the clear power to initiate military research which will supplement and
- |
  strengthen that carried on directly under the control of the Army and
- |
  Navy.
- |2+

- |2+

- " And for the Public Welfare \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  One of our hopes is that after the war there will be full employment.
- |
  To reach that goal the full creative and productive energies of the American
- |
  people must be released. To create more jobs we must make new and better
- |
  and cheaper products. We want plenty of new, vigorous enterprises. But new
- |
  products and processes are not born full-grown. They are founded on new
- |
  principles and new conceptions which in turn result from basic scientific
- |
  research. Basic scientific research is scientific capital. Moreover, we
- |
  cannot any longer depend upon Europe as a major source of this scientific
- |
  capital. Clearly, more and better scientific research is one essential to the
- |
  achievement of our goal of full employment.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  How do we increase this scientific capital? First, we must have plenty
- |
  of men and women trained in science, for upon them depends both the
- |
  creation of new knowledge and its application to practical purposes. Second,
- |
  we must strengthen the centers of basic research which are principally the
- |
  colleges, universities, and research institutes. These institutions provide
- |
  the environment which is most conducive to the creation of new scientific
- |
  knowledge and least under pressure for immediate, tangible results. With
- |
  some notable exceptions, most research in industry and Government involves
- |
  application of existing scientific knowledge to practical problems. It is
- |
  only the colleges, universities, and a few research institutes that devote
- |
  most of their research efforts to expanding the frontiers of knowledge.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Expenditures for scientific research by industry and Government increased from
- |
  $140,000,000 in 1930 to $309,000,000 in 1940. Those for the colleges and
- |
  universities increased from $20,000,000 to $31,000,000, while those for the
- |
  research institutes declined from $5,200,000 to $4,500,000 during the same
- |
  period. If the colleges, universities, and research institutes are to meet
- |
  the rapidly increasing demands of industry and Government for new
- |
  scientific knowledge, their basic research should be strengthened by use
- |
  of public funds.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  For science to serve as a powerful factor in our national welfare, applied
- |
  research both in Government and in industry must be vigorous. To improve
- |
  the quality of scientific research within the Government, steps should be
- |
  taken to modify the procedures for recruiting, classifying, and compensating
- |
  scientific personnel in order to reduce the present handicap of governmental
- |
  scientific bureaus in competing with industry and the universities for
- |
  top-grade scientific talent. To provide coordination of the common
- |
  scientific activities of these governmental agencies as to policies and
- |
  budgets, a permanent Science Advisory Board should be created to advise
- |
  the executive and legislative branches of Government on these matters.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The most important ways in which the Government can promote industrial
- |
  research are to increase the flow of new scientific knowledge through support
- |
  of basic research, and to aid in the development of scientific talent.
- |
  In addition, the Government should provide suitable incentives to industry
- |
  to conduct research, (a) by clarification of present uncertainties
- |
  in the Internal Revenue Code in regard to the deductibility of research
- |
  and development expenditures as current charges against net income, and
- |
  (b) by strengthening the patent system so as to eliminate uncertainties
- |
  which now bear heavily on small industries and so as to prevent abuses
- |
  which reflect discredit upon a basically sound system. In addition, ways
- |
  should be found to cause the benefits of basic research to reach industries
- |
  which do not now utilize new scientific knowledge.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- " WE MUST RENEW OUR SCIENTIFIC TALENT \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The responsibility for the creation of new scientific knowledge - and for most
- |
  of its application - rests on that small body of men and women who
- |
  understand the fundamental laws of nature and are skilled in the techniques
- |
  of scientific research. We shall have rapid or slow advance on any scientific
- |
  frontier depending on the number of highly qualified and trained scientists
- |
  exploring it.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The deficit of science and technology students who, but for the war, would
- |
  have received bachelor's degrees is about 150,000. It is estimated that
- |
  the deficit of those obtaining advanced degrees in these fields will amount
- |
  in 1955 to about 17,000 - for it takes at least 6 years from college entry
- |
  to achieve a doctor's degree or its equivalent in science or engineering.
- |
  The real ceiling on our productivity of new scientific knowledge and its
- |
  application in the war against disease, and the development of new
- |
  products and new industries, is the number of trained scientists available.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The training of a scientist is a long and expensive process. Studies clearly
- |
  show that there are talented individuals in every part of the population,
- |
  but with few exceptions, those without the means of buying higher education
- |
  go without it. If ability, and not the circumstance of family fortune,
- |
  determines who shall receive higher education in science, then we
- |
  shall be assured of constantly improving quality at every level of
- |
  scientific activity. The Government should provide a reasonable number of
- |
  undergraduate scholarships and graduate fellowships in order to develop
- |
  scientific talent in American youth. The plans should be designed to attract
- |
  into science only that proportion of youthful talent appropriate to the
- |
  needs of science in relation to the other needs of the nation for high
- |
  abilities.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- " Including Those in Uniform \n"
- |2+

- |
  The most immediate prospect of making up the deficit in scientific personnel
- |
  is to develop the scientific talent in the generation now in uniform. Even
- |
  if we should start now to train the current crop of high-school graduates
- |
  none would complete graduate studies before 1951. The Armed Services should
- |
  comb their records for men who, prior to or during the war, have given
- |
  evidence of talent for science, and make prompt arrangements, consistent
- |
  with current discharge plans, for ordering those who remain in uniform,
- |
  as soon as militarily possible, to duty at institutions here and overseas where
- |
  they can continue their scientific education. Moreover, the Services should
- |
  see that those who study overseas have the benefit of the latest scientific
- |
  information resulting from research during the war.
- |2+

- |2+

- " THE LID MUST BE LIFTED \n"
- |2+

- |
  While most of the war research has involved the application of
- |
  existing scientific knowledge to the problems of war, rather than basic
- |
  research, there has been accumulated a vast amount of information
- |
  relating to the application of science to particular problems. Much
- |
  of this can be used by industry. It is also needed for teaching in
- |
  the colleges and universities here and in the Armed Forces Institutes
- |
  overseas. Some of this information must remain secret, but most of it
- |
  should be made public as soon as there is ground for belief that the
- |
  enemy will not be able to turn it against us in this war. To select that
- |
  portion which should be made public, to coordinate its release,
- |
  and definitely to encourage its publication, a Board composed of Army,
- |
  Navy, and civilian scientific members should be promptly established.
- |2+

- |2+

- " A PROGRAM FOR ACTION \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The Government should accept new responsibilities for promoting
- |
  the flow of new scientific knowledge and the development of
- |
  scientific talent in our youth. These responsibilities are the proper
- |
  concern of the Government, for they vitally affect our health, our
- |
  jobs, and our national security. It is in keeping also with basic United
- |
  States policy that the Government should foster the opening of new
- |
  frontiers and this is the modern way to do it. For many years the
- |
  Government has wisely supported research in the agricultural colleges
- |
  and the benefits have been great. The time has come when such support
- |
  should be extended to other fields.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The effective discharge of these new responsibilities will require
- |
  the full attention of some over-all agency devoted to that purpose. There
- |
  is not now in the permanent Governmental structure receiving its funds
- |
  from Congress an agency adapted to supplementing the support of basic
- |
  research in the colleges, universities, and research institutes,
- |
  both in medicine and the natural sciences, adapted to supporting research
- |
  on new weapons for both Services, or adapted to administering a program
- |
  of science scholarships and fellowships.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Therefore I recommend that a new agency for these purposes be established.
- |
  Such an agency should be composed of persons of broad interest and
- |
  experience, having an understanding of the peculiarities of scientific
- |
  research and scientific education. It should have stability of funds so
- |
  that long-range programs may be undertaken. It should recognize
- |
  that freedom of inquiry must be preserved and should leave internal
- |
  control of policy, personnel, and the method and scope of research to
- |
  the institutions in which it is carried on. It should be fully
- |
  responsible to the President and through him to the Congress for
- |
  its program.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Early action on these recommendations is imperative if this nation
- |
  is to meet the challenge of science in the crucial years ahead. On the
- |
  wisdom with which we bring science to bear in the war against disease,
- |
  in the creation of new industries, and in the strengthening of our
- |
  Armed Forces depends in large measure our future as a nation.
- |2+

- |2+

- "          Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION  \n"
- |2+

- "  Scientific Progress is Essential  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  We all know how much the new drug, penicillin, has meant to our grievously
- |
  wounded men on the grim battlefronts of this war - the countless lives it
- |
  has saved - the incalculable suffering which its use has prevented. Science
- |
  and the great practical genius of this nation made this achievement possible.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Some of us know the vital role which radar has played in bringing the United
- |
  Nations to victory over Nazi Germany and in driving the Japanese steadily
- |
  back from their island bastions. Again it was painstaking scientific research
- |
  over many years that made radar possible.
- |2+

- |2+

- "What we often forget are the millions of pay envelopes on a peacetime Saturday
  \n"
- |
  night which are filled because new products and new industries have provided
- |
  jobs for countless Americans.  Science made that possible, too.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  In 1939 millions of people were employed in industries which did not even
- |
  exist at the close of the last war - radio, air conditioning, rayon and other
- |
  synthetic fibers, and plastics are examples of the products of these industries.
- |
  But these things do not mark the end of progress - they are but the beginning
- |
  if we make full use of our scientific resources.  New manufacturing industries
- |
  can be started and many older industries greatly strengthened and expanded if
- "we continue to study nature's laws and apply new knowledge to practical \n"
- |
  purposes.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Great advances in agriculture are also based upon scientific research.  Plants
- |
  which are more resistant to disease and are adapted to short growing season,
- |
  the prevention and cure of livestock diseases, the control of our insect
- |
  enemies, better fertilizers, and improved agricultural practices, all stem
- |
  from painstaking scientific research.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Advances in science when put to practical use mean more jobs, higher wages,
- |
  shorter hours, more abundant crops, more leisure for recreation, for study,
- |
  for learning how to live without the deadening drudgery which has been the
- "burden of the common man for ages past.  Advances in science will also \n"
- "bring higher standards of living, will lead to the prevention or cure of \n"
- |
  diseases, will promote conservation of our limited national resources, and
- "will assure means of defense against aggression.  But to achieve these \n"
- |
  objectives - to secure a high level of employment, to maintain a position
- "of world leadership - the flow of new scientific knowledge must be both \n"
- |
  continuous and substantial.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Our population increased from 75 million to 130 million between 1900 and
- |
  1940. In some countries comparable increases have been accompanied by
- |
  famine. In this country the increase has been accompanied by
- |
  more abundant food supply, better living, more leisure, longer life, and
- |
  better health. This is, largely, the product of three factors - the free play of
- |
  initiative of a vigorous people under democracy, the heritage of great
- |
  national wealth, and the advance of science and its application.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Science, by itself, provides no panacea for individual, social, and economic
- |
  ills. It can be effective in the national welfare only as a member of a team,
- |
  whether the conditions be peace or war. But without scientific progress
- |
  no amount of achievement in other directions can insure our health,
- |
  prosperity, and security as a nation in the modern world.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- "  Science Is a Proper Concern of Government  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It has been basic United States policy that Government should foster the
- |
  opening of new frontiers. It opened the seas to clipper ships and
- |
  furnished land for pioneers. Although these frontiers have more or less
- |
  disappeared, the frontier of science remains. It is in keeping with the
- |
  American tradition - one which has made the United States great -
- |
  that new frontiers shall be made accessible for development by
- |
  all American citizens.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Moreover, since health, well-being, and security are proper concerns of
- |
  Government, scientific progress is, and must be, of vital interest
- |
  to Government. Without scientific progress the national health would
- |
  deteriorate; without scientific progress we could not hope for
- |
  improvement in our standard of living or for an increased number of jobs
- |
  for our citizens; and without scientific progress we could not have maintained
- |
  our liberties against tyranny.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- "  Government Relations to Science - Past and Future  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  From early days the Government has taken an active interest in scientific
- |
  matters. During the nineteenth century the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the
- |
  Naval Observatory, the Department of Agriculture, and the Geological
- |
  Survey were established. Through the Land Grant College acts the
- |
  Government has supported research in state institutions for more than 80 years
- |
  on a gradually increasing scale. Since 1900 a large number of scientific
- |
  agencies have been established within the Federal Government, until in 1939
- |
  they numbered more than 40.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Much of the scientific research done by Government agencies is intermediate
- |
  in character between the two types of work commonly referred to as
- |
  basic and applied research. Almost all Government scientific work has
- |
  ultimate practical objectives but, in many fields of broad national concern,
- |
  it commonly involves long-term investigation of a fundamental nature.
- |
  Generally speaking, the scientific agencies of Government are not so
- |
  concerned with immediate practical objectives as are the laboratories
- |
  of industry nor, on the other hand, are they as free to explore any
- |
  natural phenomena without regard to possible economic applications as
- |
  are the educational and private research institutions. Government scientific
- |
  agencies have splendid records of achievement, but they are limited
- |
  in function.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  We have no national policy for science. The Government has only begun
- |
  to utilize science in the nation's welfare. There is no body within the
- |
  Government charged with formulating or executing a national science
- |
  policy. There are no standing committees of the Congress devoted to
- |
  this important subject. Science has been in the wings. It should be brought to
- |
  the center of the stage - for in it lies much of our hope for the future.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  There are areas of science in which the public interest is acute but which
- |
  are likely to be cultivated inadequately if left without more support than
- |
  will come from private sources. These areas - such as research on military
- |
  problems, agriculture, housing, public health, certain medical research,
- |
  and research involving expensive capital facilities beyond the capacity
- |
  of private institutions - should be advanced by active Government support.
- |
  To date, with the exception of the intensive war research conducted by
- |
  the Office of Scientific Research and Development, such support has been
- |
  meager and intermittent.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  For reasons presented in this report we are entering a period when science
- |
  needs and deserves increased support from public funds.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- "  Freedom of Inquiry Must Be Preserved  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The publicly and privately supported colleges, universities, and research
- |
  institutes are the centers of basic research. They are the wellsprings of
- |
  knowledge and understanding. As long as they are vigorous and healthy
- |
  and their scientists are free to pursue the truth wherever it may
- |
  lead, there will be a flow of new scientific knowledge to those who can apply
- |
  it to practical problems in Government, in industry, or elsewhere.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Many of the lessons learned in the war-time application of science under
- |
  Government can be profitably applied in peace. The Government is peculiarly
- |
  fitted to perform certain functions, such as the coordination and support of
- |
  broad programs on problems of great national importance. But we must proceed
- |
  with caution in carrying over the methods which work in wartime to the
- |
  very different conditions of peace. We must remove the rigid controls
- |
  which we have had to impose, and recover freedom of inquiry and that healthy
- |
  competitive scientific spirit so necessary for expansion of the frontiers
- |
  of scientific knowledge.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Scientific progress on a broad front results from the free play of free
- |
  intellects, working on subjects of their own choice, in the manner dictated
- |
  by their curiosity for exploration of the unknown. Freedom of inquiry
- |
  must be preserved under any plan for Government support of science
- |
  in accordance with the Five Fundamentals listed on
- |2
   page 26 .
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The study of the momentous questions presented in President Roosevelt's
- |
  letter has been made by able committees working diligently. This report
- |
  presents conclusions and recommendations based upon the studies of
- |
  these committees which appear in full as the appendices. Only in the
- |
  creation of one over-all mechanism rather than several does this report
- |
  depart from the specific recommendations of the committees. The members of
- |
  the committees have reviewed the recommendations in regard to the single
- |
  mechanism and have found this plan thoroughly acceptable.

- "  Chapter 2  THE WAR AGAINST DISEASE  \n"
- |2+

- "  In War  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The death rate for all diseases in the Army, including the overseas forces,
- |
  has been reduced from 14.1 per thousand in the last war to 0.6 per thousand
- "in this war. \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Such ravaging diseases as yellow fever, dysentery, typhus, tetanus, pneumonia,
- |
  and meningitis have been all but conquered by penicillin and the sulfa drugs,
- |
  the insecticide DDT, better vaccines, and improved hygenic measures.  Malaria
- |
  has been controlled.  There has been dramatic progress in surgery.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The striking advances in medicine during the war have been possible only because
- |
  we had a large backlog of scientific data accumulated through basic research
- |
  in many scientific fields in the years before the war.
- |2+

- |2+

- "  In Peace  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  In the last 40 years life expectancy in the United States has increased from
- |
  49 to 65 years largely as a consequence of the reduction in the death rates of
- |
  infants and children; in the last 20 years the death rate from the diseases
- |
  of childhood has been reduced 87 percent.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Diabetes has been brought under control by insulin, pernicious anemia by
- |
  liver extracts; and the once widespread deficiency diseases have been much
- |
  reduced, even in the lowest income groups, by accessory food factors and
- |
  improvement of diet.  Notable advances have been made in the early diagnosis
- |
  of cancer, and in the surgical and radiation treatment of the disease.
- |2+

- |2+

- "These results have been achieved through a great amount of basic research \n"
- |
  in medicine and the preclinical sciences, and by the dissemination of this
- |
  new scientific knowledge through the physicians and medical services and
- |
  public health agencies of the country.  In this cooperative endeavour the
- |
  pharmaceutical industry has played an important role, especially during the
- |
  war.  All of the medical and public health groups share credit for these
- |
  achievements; they form interdependent members of a team.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Progress in combating disease depends upon an expanding body of new scientific
- |
  knowledge.
- |2+

- |2+

- "  Unsolved Problems  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  As President Roosevelt observed, the annual deaths from one or two diseases
- |
  are far in excess of the total number of American lives lost in battle during
- |
  this war.  A large fraction of these deaths in our civilian population cut
- |
  short the useful lives of our citizens.  This is our present position despite
- "the fact that in the last three decades notable progress has been made in \n"
- |
  civilian medicine.  The reduction in death rate from diseases of childhood
- |
  has shifted the emphasis to the middle and old age groups, particularly to
- |
  the malignant diseases and the degenerative processes prominent in later
- |
  life.  Cardiovascular disease, including chronic disease of the kidneys,
- |
  arteriosclerosis, and cerebral hemorrhage, now account for 45 percent of the
- |
  deaths in the United States.  Second are the infectious diseases, and third
- |
  is cancer.  Added to these are many maladies (for example, the common cold,
- |
  arthritis, asthma and hay fever, peptic ulcer) which, through infrequently
- |
  fatal, cause incalculable disability.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Another aspect of the changing emphasis is the increase of mental diseases.
- |
  Approximately 7 million persons in the United States are mentally ill; more
- |
  than one-third of the hospital beds are occupied by such persons, at a cost
- |
  of $175 million a year.  Each year 125,000 new mental cases are hospitalized.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Notwithstanding great progress in prolonging the span of life and relief
- |
  of suffering, much illness remains for which adequate means of prevention
- "and cure are not yet known.  While additional physicians, hospitals, and \n"
- |
  health programs are needed, their full usefulness cannot be attained unless
- |
  we enlarge our knowledge of the human organism and the nature of disease.
- |
  Any extension of medical facilities must be accompanied by an expanded program
- |
  of medical training and research.

- |2+

- " Broad and Basic Studies Needed  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Discoveries pertinent to medical progress have often come from remote and
- |
  unexpected sources, and it is certain that this will be true in the future.
- |
  It is wholly probable that progress in the treatment of cardiovascular
- |
  disease, renal disease, cancer, and similar refractory diseases will be
- |
  made as the result of fundamental discoveries in subjects unrelated to those
- |
  diseases, and perhaps entirely unexpected by the investigator.  Further progress
- "requires that the entire front of medicine and the underlying sciences of \n"
- |
  chemistry, physics, anatomy, biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology,
- |
  bacteriology, pathology, parasitology, etc., be broadly developed.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Progress in the war against disease results from discoveries in remote and
- |
  unexpected fields of medicine and the underlying sciences.

- "  Coordinated Attack on Special Problems  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- "Penicillin reached our troops in time to save countless lives because the \n"
- |
  Government coordinated and supported the program of research and development
- |
  on the drug.  The development moved from the early laboratory stage to large
- |
  scale production and use in a fraction of the time it would have taken without
- |
  such leadership.  The search for better anti-malarials, which proceeded at a
- |
  moderate tempo for many years, has been accelerated enormously by Government
- |
  support during the war.  Other examples can be cited in which medical progress
- |
  has been similarly advanced.  In achieving these results, the Government has
- |
  provided over-all coordination and support; it has not dictated how the work
- |
  should be done within any cooperating institution.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Discovery of new therapeutic agents and methods usually results from basic
- |
  studies in medicine and the underlying sciences.  The development of such
- |
  materials and methods to the point at which they become available to
- |
  medical practitioners requires teamwork involving the medical schools, the
- |
  science departments of universities, Government and the pharmaceutical
- |
  industry.  Government initiative, support, and coordination can be very
- |
  effective in this development phase.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Government initiative and support for the development of newly discovered
- |
  therapeutic materials and methods can reduce the time required to bring the
- |
  benefits to the public.
- |2+

- |2+

- " Action is Necessary  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- "The primary place for medical research is in the medical schools and \n"
- |
  universities.  In some cases coordinated direct attack on special problems
- |
  may be made by teams of investigators, supplementing similar attacks carried
- |
  on by the Army, Navy, Public Health Service, and other organizations.  Apart
- "from teaching, however, the primary obligation of the medical schools and \n"
- "universities is to continue the traditional function of such institutions, \n"
- |
  namely,  to provide the individual worker with an opportunity for free,
- |
  untrammeled study of nature, in the directions and by the methods suggested
- |
  by his interests, curiosity, and imagination.  The history of medical science
- |
  teaches clearly the supreme importance of affording the prepared mind complete
- "freedom for the exercise of initiative.  It is the special province of the \n"
- |
  medical schools and universities to foster medical research in this way - a duty
- |
  which cannot be shifted to government agencies, industrial organizations, or
- |
  to any other institutions.
- |2+

- |2+

- "Where clinical investigations of the human body are required, the medical \n"
- "schools are in a unique position, because of their close relationship to \n"
- |
  teaching hospitals, to integrate such investigations with the work of the
- |
  departments of preclinical science, and to impart new knowledge to physicians
- |
  in training.  At the same time, the teaching hospitals are especially well
- |
  qualified to carry on medical research because of their close connection with
- |
  the medical schools, on which they depend for staff and supervision.
- |2+

- |2+

- "Between World War I and World War II the United States overtook all other \n"
- |
  nations in medical research and assumed a position of world leadership. To
- |
  a considerable extent this progress reflected the liberal financial support
- "from university endowment income, gifts from individuals, and foundation \n"
- |
  grants in the 20's.  The growth of research departments in medical schools
- |
  ahs been very uneven, however, and in consequence most of the important work
- |
  has been done in a few large schools.  This should be corrected by building up
- |
  the weaker institutions, especially in regions which now have no strong medical
- "research activities.  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The traditional sources of support for medical research, largely endowment
- |
  income, foundation grants, and private donations, are diminishing, and there is
- |
  no immediate prospect of a change in this trend.  Meanwhile, research costs have
- |
  steadily risen.  More elaborate and expensive equipment is required, supplies
- |
  are more costly, and the wages of assistants are higher.  Industry is only to
- |
  a limited extent a source of funds for basic medical research.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It is clear that if we are to maintain the progress in medicine which has
- |
  marked the last 25 years, the Government should extend financial support to
- |
  basic medical research in the medical schools and in the universities, through
- "grants both for research and for fellowships.  The amount which can be \n"
- |
  effectively spent in the first year should not exceed 5 million dollars.
- |
  After a program is under way perhaps 20 million dollars a year can be spent
- |
  effectively.

- |2+

- " Relation to National Security  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  In this war it has become clear beyond all doubt that scientific research is
- |
  absolutely essential to national security.  The bitter and dangerous battle
- |
  against the U-boat was a battle of scientific techniques - and our margin of
- |
  success was dangerously small.  The new eyes which radar supplied to our
- |
  fighting forces quickly evoked the development of scientific countermeasures
- |
  which could often blind them. This again represents the ever continuing battle
- |
  of techniques.  The V-1 attack on London was finally defeated by three devices
- |
  developed during this war and used superbly in the field.  V-2 was countered
- |
  only by the capture of the launching sites.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The Secretaries of War and Navy recently stated in a joint letter to the
- |
  National Academy of Sciences:
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  This war emphasizes three facts of supreme importance to national security:
- |
  (1) Powerful new tactics of defense and offense are developed around new
- |
  weapons created by scientific and engineering research; (2) the competitive
- |
  time element in developing those weapons and tactics may be decisive; (3) war
- |
  is increasingly total war, in which the armed services must be supplemented by
- |
  active participation of every element of civilian population.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  To insure continued preparedness along farsighted technical lines, the research
- |
  scientists of the country must be called upon to continue in peacetime some
- |
  substantial portion of those types of contribution to national security which
- |
  they have made so effectively during the stress of the present war * * *.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  There must be more - and more adequate - military research during peacetime.
- |
  We cannot again rely on our allies to hold off the enemy while we struggle
- |
  to catch up.  Further, it is clear that only the Government can undertake
- |
  military research; for it must be carried on in secret, much of it has no
- |
  commercial value, and it is expensive.  The obligation of Government to support
- |
  research on military problems is inescapable.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Modern war requires the use of the most advanced scientific techniques.  Many
- |
  of the leaders in the development of radar are scientists who before the war
- |
  had been exploring the nucleus of the atom.  While there must be increased
- |
  emphasis on science in the future training of officers for both the Army and
- |
  Navy, such men cannot be expected to be specialists in scientific research.
- |
  Therefore a professional partnership between the officers in the Services
- |
  and civilian scientists is needed.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The Army and Navy should continue to carry on research and development on the
- |
  improvement of current weapons.  For many years the National Advisory Committee
- |
  for Aeronautics has supplemented the work of the Army and Navy by conducting
- "basic research on the problems of flight.  There should now be permanent \n"
- |
  civilian activity to supplement the research work of the Services in other
- "scientific fields so as to carry on in time of peace some part of the \n"
- "activities of the emergency war-time Office of Scientific Research and \n"
- |
  Development.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Military preparedness requires a permanent independent, civilian-controlled
- |
  organization, having close liaison with the Army and Navy, but with funds
- |
  directly from Congress and with the clear power to initiate military research
- |
  which will supplement and strengthen that carried on directly under the control
- |
  of the Army and Navy.

- " Science and Jobs  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- "One of our hopes is that after the war there will be full employment, and \n"
- |
  that the production of goods and services will serve to raise our standard
- |
  of living.  We do not know yet how we shall reach that goal, but it is certain
- |
  that it can be achieved only by releasing the full creative and productive
- "energies of the American people. \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Surely we will not get there by standing still, merely by making the same
- |
  things we made before and selling them at the same or higher prices.  We
- "will not get ahead in international trade unless we offer new and more \n"
- "attractive and cheaper products. \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Where will these new products come from?  How will we find ways to make better
- |
  products at lower cost?  The answer is clear.  There must be a stream of new
- |
  scientific knowledge to turn the wheels of private and public enterprise.  There
- |
  must be plenty of men and women trained in science and technology for upon
- |
  them depend both the creation of new knowledge and its application to practical
- |
  purposes.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  More and better scientific research is essential to the achievement of our
- |
  goal of full employment.
- |2+

- |2+

- " The Importance of Basic Research  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Basic research is performed without thought of practical ends.  It results
- "in general knowledge and an understanding of nature and its laws.  This \n"
- |
  general knowledge provides the means of answering a large number of important
- |
  practical problems, though it may not give a complete specific answer to any
- |
  one of them.  The function of applied research is to provide such complete
- |
  answers.  The scientist doing basic research may not be at all interested in
- |
  the practical applications of his work, yet the further progress of industrial
- |
  development would eventually stagnate if basic scientific research were long
- "neglected. \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  One of the peculiarities of basic science is the variety of paths which lead
- |
  to productive advance.  Many of the most important discoveries have come as
- "a result of experiments undertaken with very different purposes in mind.  \n"
- |
  Statistically it is certain that important and highly useful discoveries will
- |
  result from some fraction of the undertakings in basic science; but the results
- |
  of any one particular investigation cannot be predicted with accuracy.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Basic research leads to new knowledge.  It provides scientific capital.  It
- |
  creates the fund from which the practical applications of knowledge must be
- |
  drawn.  New products and new processes do not appear full-grown.  They are
- |
  founded on new principles and new conceptions, which in turn are painstakingly
- |
  developed by research in the purest realms of science.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Today, it is truer than ever that basic research is the pacemaker of
- |
  technological progress.  In the nineteenth century, Yankee mechanical ingenuity,
- "building largely upon the basic discoveries of European scientists, could \n"
- |
  greatly advance the technical arts.  Now the situation is different.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  A nation which depends upon others for its new basic scientific knowledge
- |
  will be slow in its industrial progress and weak in its competitive position
- |
  in world trade, regardless of its mechanical skill.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- " Centers of Basic Research  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Publicly and privately supported colleges and universities and
- |
  the endowed research institutes must furnish both the new scientific
- |
  knowledge and the trained research workers. These institutions are uniquely
- |
  qualified by tradition and by their special characteristics to carry
- |
  on basic research. They are charged with the responsibility of conserving
- |
  the knowledge accumulated by the past, imparting that knowledge to
- |
  students, and contributing new knowledge of all kinds. It is chiefly in
- |
  these institutions that scientists may work in an atmosphere which is
- |
  relatively free from the adverse pressure of convention, prejudice,
- |
  or commercial necessity. At their best they provide the scientific
- |
  worker with a strong sense of solidarity and security, as well as a
- |
  substantial degree of personal intellectual freedom. All of these
- |
  factors are of great importance in the development of new knowledge,
- |
  since much of new knowledge is certain to arouse opposition because
- |
  of its tendency to challenge current beliefs or practice.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Industry is generally inhibited by preconceived goals, by its own clearly
- |
  defined standards, and by the constant pressure of commercial necessity.
- |
  Satisfactory progress in basic science seldom occurs under conditions
- |
  prevailing in the normal industrial laboratory. There are some notable
- |
  exceptions, it is true, but even in such cases it is rarely possible
- |
  to match the universities in respect to the freedom which is so important
- |
  to scientific discovery.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  To serve effectively as the centers of basic research these institutions
- |
  must be strong and healthy. They must attract our best scientists as
- |
  teachers and investigators. They must offer research opportunities and
- |
  sufficient compensation to enable them to compete with industry and
- |
  government for the cream of scientific talent.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  During the past 25 years there has been a great increase in industrial
- |
  research involving the application of scientific knowledge to a
- |
  multitude of practical purposes - thus providing new products, new
- |
  industries, new investment opportunities, and millions of jobs.
- |
  During the same period research within Government - again largely
- |
  applied research - has also been greatly expanded. In the decade
- |
  from 1930 to 1940 expenditures for industrial research increased from
- |
  $116,000,000 to $240,000,000 and those for scientific research in
- |
  Government rose from $24,000,000 to $69,000,000. During the same
- |
  period expenditures for scientific research in the colleges and
- |
  universities increased from $20,000,000 to $31,000,000, while those
- |
  in the endowed research institutes declined from $5,200,000 to
- |
  $4,500,000. These are the best estimates available. The figures
- |
  have been taken from a variety of sources and arbitrary definitions
- |
  have necessarily been applied, but it is believed that they may be
- |
  accepted as indicating the following trends:
- |2+

- |2+

- |2
   (a) Expenditures for scientific research by industry and Government -
- |2
       almost entirely applied research - have more than doubled between
- |2
       1930 and 1940. Whereas in 1930 they were six times as large as
- |2
       the research expenditures of the colleges, universities, and research
- |2
       institutes, by 1940 they were nearly ten times as large.
- |2
   (b) While expenditures for scientific research in the colleges and
- |2
       universities increased by one-half during this period, those for
- |2
       the endowed research institutes have slowly declined.
- |2+

- |
  If the colleges, universities, and research institutes are to meet the rapidly
- |
  increasing demands of industry and Government for new scientific knowledge,
- |
  their basic research should be strengthened by use of public funds.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- " Research Within the Government  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Although there are some notable exceptions, most research
- |
  conducted within governmental laboratories is of an applied nature.
- |
  This has always been true and is likely to remain so. Hence
- |
  Government, like industry, is dependent on the colleges, universities,
- |
  and research institutes to expand the basic scientific frontiers and
- |
  to furnish trained scientific investigators.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Research within the Government represents an important part of our
- |
  total research activity and needs to be strengthened and expanded
- |
  after the war. Such expansion should be directed to fields of inquiry and
- |
  service which are of public importance and are not adequately carried
- |
  on by private organizations.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The most important single factor in scientific and technical work is
- |
  the quality of the personnel employed. The procedures currently
- |
  followed within the Government for recruiting, classifying and compensating
- |
  such personnel place the Government under a severe handicap in competing
- |
  with industry and the universities for first-class scientific talent. Steps
- |
  should be taken to reduce that handicap.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  In the Government the arrangement whereby the numerous scientific
- |
  agencies form parts of larger departments has both advantages
- |
  and disadvantages. but the present pattern is firmly established and
- |
  there is much to be said for it. There is, however, a very real need for
- |
  some measure of coordination of the common scientific activities of
- |
  these agencies, both as to policies and budgets, and at present no such
- |
  means exist.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  A permanent Science Advisory Board should be created to consult with
- |
  these scientific bureaus and to advise the executive and legislative
- |
  branches of Government as to the policies and budgets of Government
- |
  agencies engaged in scientific research.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  This board should be composed of disinterested scientists who have no
- |
  connection with the affairs of any Government agency.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- " Industrial Research  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The simplest and most effective way in which the Government can
- |
  strengthen industrial research is to support basic research and to
- |
  develop scientific talent.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The benefits of basic research do not reach all industries equally or at
- |
  the same speed. Some small enterprises never receive any of the
- |
  benefits. It has been suggested that the benefits might be better utilized
- |
  if "research clinics" for such enterprises were to be established. Businessmen
- |
  would thus be able to make more use of research than they now do. This
- |
  proposal is certainly worthy of further study.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  One of the most important factors affecting the amount of industrial
- |
  research is the income-tax law. Government action in respect to this
- |
  subject will affect the rate of technical progress in industry.
- |
  Uncertainties as to the attitude of the Bureau of Internal Revenue
- |
  regarding the deduction of research and development expenses are
- |
  a deterrent to research expenditure. These uncertainties arise from
- |
  lack of clarity of the tax law as to the proper treatment of such costs.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The Internal Revenue Code should be amended to remove present
- |
  uncertainties in regard to the deductibility of research and development
- |
  expenditures as current charges against net income.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Research is also affected by the patent laws. They stimulate new invention
- |
  and they make it possible for new industries to be built around new
- |
  devices or new processes. These industries generate new jobs and new
- |
  products, all of which contribute to the welfare and the strength of the
- |
  country.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Yet, uncertainties in the operation of the patent laws have
- |
  impaired the ability of small industries to translate new ideas into
- |
  processes and products of value to the nation. These uncertainties
- |
  are, in part, attributable to the difficulties and expense incident
- |
  to the operation of the patent system as it presently exists. These
- |
  uncertainties are also attributable to the existence of certain
- |
  abuses, which have appeared in the use of patents. The abuses should
- |
  be corrected. They have led to extravagantly critical attacks which tend
- |
  to discredit a basically sound system.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It is important that the patent system continue to serve the country
- |
  in the manner intended by the Constitution, for it has been a vital
- |
  element in the industrial vigor which has distinguished this nation.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The National Patent Planning Commission has reported on this subject.
- |
  In addition, a detailed study, with recommendations concerning
- |
  the extent to which modifications should be made in our patent laws
- |
  is currently being made under the leadership of the Secretary of Commerce.
- |
  It is recommended, therefore, that specific action with regard to the
- |
  patent laws be withheld pending the submission of the report devoted
- |
  exclusively to that subject.
- |2+

- |2+

- " International Exchange of Scientific Information  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  International exchange of scientific information is of growing importance.
- |
  Increasing specialization of science will make it more important
- |
  than ever that scientists in this country keep continually ahead of
- |
  developments abroad. In addition a flow of scientific information constitutes
- |
  one facet of general international accord which should be cultivated.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The Government can accomplish significant results in several ways: by aiding
- |
  in the arrangement of international science congresses, in the
- |
  official accrediting of American scientists to such gatherings, in the
- |
  official reception of foreign scientists of standing in this country,
- |
  in making possible a rapid flow of technical information, including
- |
  translation service, and possibly in the provision of international
- |
  fellowships. Private foundations and other groups partially fulfill some of
- |
  these functions at present, but their scope is incomplete and inadequate.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The Government should take an active role in promoting the international
- |
  flow of scientific information.
- |2+

- |2+

- " The Special Need for Federal Support  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  We can no longer count on ravaged Europe as a source of fundamental knowledge.
- "In the past we have devoted much of our best efforts to the application of \n"
- |
  such knowledge which has been discovered abroad.  In the future we must pay
- |
  increased attention to discovering this knowledge for ourselves particularly
- |
  since the scientific applications of the future will be more than ever dependent
- |
  upon such basic knowledge.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  New impetus must be given to research in our country.   Such impetus can come
- |
  promptly only from the Government.  Expenditures for research in the colleges,
- |
  universities, and research institutes will otherwise not be able to meet the
- |
  additional demands of increased public need for research.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Further, we cannot expect industry adequately to fill the gap.  Industry will
- |
  fully rise to the challenge of applying new knowledge to new products.  The
- "commercial incentive can be relied upon for that.  But basic research is \n"
- |
  essentially noncommercial in nature.  It will not receive the attention it
- |
  requires if left to industry.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  For many years the Government has wisely supported research in the agricultural
- |
  colleges and the benefits have been great.  The time has come when such support
- "should be extended to other fields.  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  In providing government support, however, we must endeavor to preserve as far
- "as possible the private support of research both in industry and in the \n"
- |
  colleges, universities, and research institutes.  These private sources should
- |
  continue to carry their share of the financial burden.
- |2+

- |2+

- " The Cost of a Program  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It is estimated that an adequate program for Federal support of basic research
- |
  in the colleges, universities, and research institutes and for financing
- |
  important applied research in the public interest, will cost about 10 million
- |
  dollars at the outset and may rise to about 50 million dollars annually when
- |
  fully underway at the end of perhaps 5 years.

- |
  will always be the rare individual who will rise to the top without benefit
- "of formal education and training, he is the exception and even he might make \n"
- |
  a more notable contribution if he had the benefit of the best education we
- |
  have to offer.  I cannot improve on President Conant's statement that:
- |2+

- |2+

- |2
   "* * * in every section of the entire area where the word science may properly
- |
  be applied, the limiting factor is a human one.  We shall have rapid or slow
- "advance in this direction or in that depending on the number of really \n"
- |
  first-class men who are engaged in the work in question.  * * * So in the last
- |
  analysis, the future of science in this country will be determined by our basic
- |
  educational policy."
- |2+

- |2+

- " A Note of Warning  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It would be folly to set up a program under which research in the natural
- "sciences and medicine was expanded at the cost of the social sciences, \n"
- |
  humanities, and other studies so essential to national well-being.  This point
- |
  has been well stated by the Moe Committee as follows:
- |2+

- |2+

- "\" As citizens, as good citizens, we therefore think that we must have in \n"
- |
  mind while examining the question before us - the discovery and development
- |
  of scientific talent - the needs of the whole national welfare.  We could
- |
  not suggest to you a program which would syphon into science and technology
- "a disproportionately large share of the nation's highest abilities, without \n"
- |
  doing harm to the nation, nor, indeed, without crippling science.  * * * Science
- |
  cannot live by and unto itself alone."
- |2+

- |2+

- |2
      *     *    *     *    *     *    *     *    *     *    *     *    *     *
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  "The uses to which high ability in youth can be put are various and, to a large
- |
  extent, are determined by social pressures and rewards.  When aided by selective
- |
  devices for picking out scientifically talented youth, it is clear that large
- |
  sums of money for scholarships and fellowships and monetary and other rewards
- |
  in disproportionate amounts might draw into science too large a percentage
- |
  of the nation's high ability, with a result highly detrimental to the nation
- |
  and to science.  Plans for the discovery and development of scientific talent
- |
  must be related to the other needs of society for high ability.  * * * There
- |
  is never enough ability at high levels to satisfy all the needs of the nation;
- "we would not seek to draw into science any more of it than science's \n"
- |
  proportionate share."
- |2+

- |2+

- " The Wartime Deficit  \n"
- " \n"
- |2+

- |
  Among the young men and women qualified to take up scientific work, since 1940
- |
  there have been few students over 18, except some in medicine and engineering
- |
  in Army and Navy programs and a few 4-F's, who have followed an integrated
- |
  scientific course of studies.  Neither our allies nor, so far as we know, our
- |
  enemies have done anything so radical as thus to suspend almost completely
- |
  their educational activities in scientific pursuits during the war period.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Two great principles have guided us in this country as we have turned our full
- |
  efforts to war.  First, the sound democratic principle that there should be no
- "favored classes or special privilege in a time of peril, that all should be \n"
- |
  ready to sacrifice equally; second,  the tenet that every man should serve in
- |
  the capacity in which his talents and experience can best be applied for the
- |
  prosecution of the war effort.  In general we have held these principles well
- |
  in balance.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  In my opinion, however, we have drawn too heavily for nonscientific purposes
- |
  upon the great natural resource which resides in our trained young scientists
- |
  and engineers.  For the general good of the country too many such men have gone
- |
  into uniform, and their talents have not always been fully utilized.  With the
- |
  exception of those men engaged in war research, all physically fit students
- "at graduate level have been taken into the armed forces.  Those ready for \n"
- |
  college training in the sciences have not been permitted to enter upon that
- |
  training.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  There is thus an accumulating deficit of trained research personnel which will
- |
  continue for many years.  The deficit of science and technology students who,
- |
  but for the war, would have received bachelor's degrees is about 150,000.  The
- |
  deficit of those holding advanced degrees - that is, young scholars trained to
- "the point where they are capable of carrying on original work - has been \n"
- |
  estimated as amounting to about 17,000 by 1955 in chemistry, engineering,
- |
  geology, mathematics, physics, psychology, and the biological sciences.
- |2+

- |2+

- "With mounting demands for scientists both for teaching and for research, we \n"
- |
  will enter the post-war period with a serious deficit in our trained scientific
- |
  personnel.
- |2+

- |2+

- " Improve the Quality  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- "Confronted with these deficits, we are compelled to look to the use of our \n"
- "basic human resources and formulate a program which will assure their \n"
- |
  conservation and effective development.  The committee advising me on scientific
- |
  personnel has stated the following principle which should guide our planning:
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  "If we were all-knowing and all-wise we might, but we think probably not, write
- |
  you a plan whereby there might be selected for training, which they otherwise
- |
  would not get, those who, 20 years hence, would be scientific leaders, and we
- |
  might not bother about any lesser manifestations of scientific ability.  But in
- "the present state of knowledge a plan cannot be made which will select, and \n"
- |
  assist, only those young men and women who will give the top future leadership
- |
  to science.  To get top leadership there must be a relatively large base of
- |
  high ability selected for development and then successive skimmings of the cream
- |
  of ability at successive times and at higher levels.  No one can select from
- |
  the bottom those who will be the leaders at the top because unmeasured and
- |
  unknown factors enter into scientific, or any, leadership.  There are brains
- |
  and character, strength and health, happiness and spiritual vitality, interest
- |
  and motivation, and no one knows what else, that must needs enter into this
- |
  supra-mathematical calculus.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  "We think we probably would not, even if we were all-wise and all-knowing, write
- |
  you a plan whereby you would be assured of scientific leadership at one stroke.
- |
  We think as we think because we are not interested in setting up an elect.
- |
  We think it much the best plan, in this constitutional Republic,
- |
  that opportunity be held out to all kinds and conditions of men whereby they
- |
  can better themselves.  This is the American way; this is the way the United
- |
  States has become what it is.  We think it very important that circumstances
- |
  be such that there be no ceilings, other than ability itself, to intellectual
- |
  ambition.  We think it very important that every boy and girl shall know that,
- |
  if he shows that he has what it takes, the sky is the limit.  Even if it be
- |
  shown subsequently that he has not what it takes to go to the top, he will go
- |
  further than he would otherwise go if there had been a ceiling beyond which
- |
  he always knew he could not aspire.
- |2+

- |2+

- "\"By proceeding from point to point and taking stock on the way, by giving \n"
- |
  further opportunity to those who show themselves worthy of further opportunity,
- "by giving the most opportunity to those who show themselves continually \n"
- |
  developing - this is the way we propose.  This is the American way:  a man work
- |
  for what he gets."
- |2+

- |2+

- " Remove the Barriers  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- "Higher education in this country is largely for those who have the means.  If \n"
- "those who have the means coincided entirely with those persons who have the \n"
- |
  talent we should not be squandering a part of our higher education on those
- |
  undeserving of it, nor neglecting great talent among those who fail to attend
- "college for economic reasons.  There are talented individuals in every \n"
- |
  segment of the population, but with few exceptions those without the means
- |
  of buying higher education go without it.  Here is a tremendous waste of the
- |
  greatest resource of a nation - the intelligence of its citizens.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  If ability, and not the circumstance of family fortune, is made to determine
- |
  who shall receive higher education in science, then we shall be assured of
- |
  constantly improving quality at every level of scientific activity.
- |2+

- |2+

- " The Generation in Uniform Must Not Be Lost  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- "We have a serious deficit in scientific personnel partly because the men \n"
- "who would have studied science in the colleges and universities have been \n"
- |
  serving in the Armed Forces.  Many had begun their studies before they went
- "to war.  Others with capacity for scientific education went to war after \n"
- |
  finishing high school.  The most immediate prospect of making up some of the
- "deficit in scientific personnel is by salvaging scientific talent from the \n"
- "generation in uniform.  For even if we should start now to train the current \n"
- "crop of high school graduates, it would be 1951 before they would complete \n"
- "graduate studies and be prepared for effective scientific research.  This \n"
- |
  fact underlines the necessity of salvaging potential scientists in uniform.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The Armed Services should comb their records for men who, prior to or during
- "the war, have given evidence of talent for science, and make prompt \n"
- |
  arrangements, consistent with current discharge plans, for ordering those who
- |
  remain in uniform as soon as militarily possible to duty at institutions
- "here and overseas where they can continue their scientific education.  \n"
- |
  Moreover, they should see that those who study overseas have the benefit of
- |
  the latest scientific developments.
- |2+

- |2+

- " A Program  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The country may be proud of the fact that 95 percent of boys and girls of
- |
  the fifth grade age are enrolled in school, but the drop in enrollment after
- |
  the fifth grade is less satisfying.  For every 1,000 students in the fifth
- |
  grade, 600 are lost to education before the end of high school, and all but
- |
  72 have ceased formal education before completion of college.  While we are
- |
  concerned primarily with methods of selecting and educating high school
- |
  graduates at the college and higher levels, we cannot be complacent about the
- |
  loss of potential talent which is inherent in the present situation.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Students drop out of school, college, and graduate school, or do not get that
- "far, for a variety of reasons:  they cannot afford to go on; schools and \n"
- |
  colleges providing courses equal to their capacity are not available locally;
- |
  business and industry recruit many of the most promising before they have
- |
  finished the training of which they are capable.  These reasons apply with
- |
  particular force to science:  the road is long and expensive; it extends at
- |
  least 6 years beyond high school; the percentage of science students who can
- |
  obtain first-rate training in institutions near home is small.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Improvement in the teaching of science is imperative; for students of latent
- |
  scientific ability are particularly vulnerable to high school teaching which
- |
  fails to awaken interest or to provide adequate instruction.  To enlarge the
- "group of specially qualified men and women it is necessary to increase the \n"
- |
  number who go to college.  This involves improved high school instruction,
- "provision for helping individual talented students to finish high school \n"
- |
  (primarily the responsibility of the local communities), and opportunities for
- |
  more capable, promising high school students to go to college.  Anything
- |
  short of this means serious waste of higher education and neglect of human
- |
  resources.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  To encourage and enable a larger number of young men and women of ability to
- |
  take up science as a career, and in order gradually to reduce the deficit of
- |
  trained scientific personnel, it is recommended that provision be made for a
- |
  reasonable number of (a) undergraduate scholarships and graduate fellowships
- |
  and (b) fellowships for advanced training and fundamental research.  The
- |
  details should be worked out with reference to the interests of the several
- |
  States and of the universities and colleges; and care should be taken not to
- |
  impair the freedom of the institutions and individuals concerned.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The program proposed by the Moe Committee in Appendix 4 would provide 24,000
- |
  undergraduate scholarships and 900 graduate fellowships and would cost about
- |
  $30,000,000 annually when in full operation.  Each year under this program
- "6,000 undergraduate scholarships would be made available to high school \n"
- |
  graduates, and 300 graduate fellowships would be offered to college graduates.
- |
  Approximately the scale of allowances provided for under the educational
- |
  program for returning veterans has been used in estimating the cost of this
- |
  program.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The plan is, further, that all those who receive such scholarships or
- |
  fellowships in science should be enrolled in a National Science Reserve and
- "be liable to call into the service of the Government, in connection with \n"
- |
  scientific or technical work in time of war or other national emergency
- |
  declared by Congress or proclaimed by the President. Thus, in addition to
- |
  the general benefits to the nation by reason of the addition to its trained
- |
  ranks of such a corps of scientific workers, there would be a definite benefit
- "to the nation in having these scientific workers on call in national \n"
- "emergencies.  The Government would be well advised to invest the money \n"
- |
  involved in this plan even if the benefits to the nation were thought of
- |
  solely - which they are not - in terms of national preparedness.

- " Chapter 5 A PROBLEM OF SCIENTIFIC RECONVERSION  \n"
- |2+

- " Effects of Mobilization of Science for War  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  We have been living on our fat. For more than 5 years many of our
- |
  scientists have been fighting the war in the laboratories, in
- |
  the factories and shops, and at the front. We have been directing
- |
  the energies of our scientists to the development of weapons and materials
- |
  and methods, on a large number of relatively narrow projects initiated and
- |
  controlled by the Office of Scientific Research and Development and other
- |
  Government agencies. Like troops, the scientists have been mobilized,
- |
  and thrown into action to serve their country in time of emergency.
- |
  But they have been diverted to a greater extent than is generally
- |
  appreciated from the search for answers to the fundamental problems -
- |
  from the search on which human welfare and progress depends. This
- |
  is not a complaint - it is a fact. The mobilization of science
- |
  behind the lines is aiding the fighting men at the front to
- |
  win the war and to shorten it; and it has resulted incidentally
- |
  in the accumulation of a vast amount of experience and knowledge of
- |
  the application of science to particular problems, much of which
- |
  can be put to use when the war is over. Fortunately, this country
- |
  had the scientists - and the time - to make this contribution and thus
- |
  to advance the date of victory.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- " Security Restrictions Should Be Lifted Promptly  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Much of the information and experience acquired during the war is confined
- |
  to the agencies that gathered it. Except to the extent that military security
- |
  dictates otherwise, such knowledge should be spread upon the record for
- |
  the benefit of the general public.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Thanks to the wise provision of the Secretary of War and the Secretary
- |
  of the Navy, most of the results of war-time medical research have
- |
  been published. Several hundred articles have appeared in the professional
- |
  journals; many are in process of publication. The material still subject
- |
  to security classification should be released as soon as possible.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It is my view that most of the remainder of the classified scientific material
- |
  should be released as soon as there is ground for belief that the
- |
  enemy will not be able to turn it against us in this war. Most of the
- |
  information needed by industry and in education can be released without
- |
  disclosing its embodiments in actual military material and devices.
- |
  Basically there is no reason to believe that scientists of other countries
- |
  will not in time rediscover everything we now know which is held in
- |
  secrecy. A broad dissemination of scientific information upon which further
- |
  advances can readily be made furnishes a sounder foundation for our national
- |
  security than a policy of restriction which would impede our own progress
- |
  although imposed in the hope that possible enemies would not catch up with us.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  During the war it has been necessary for selected groups of scientists
- |
  to work on specialized problems, with relatively little information as
- |
  to what other groups were doing and had done. Working against time,
- |
  the Office of Scientific Research and Development has been
- |
  obliged to enforce this practice during the war, although it was
- |
  realized by all concerned that it was an emergency measure which
- |
  prevented the continuous cross-fertilization so essential to fruitful
- |
  scientific effort.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Our ability to overcome possible future enemies depends upon scientific
- |
  advances which will proceed more rapidly with diffusion of knowledge
- |
  than under a policy of continued restriction of knowledge now
- |
  in our possession.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- " Need for Coordination  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  In planning the release of scientific data and experience collected
- |
  in connection with the war, we must not overlook the fact that
- |
  research has gone forward under many auspices - the Army, the Navy,
- |
  the Office of Scientific Research and Development, the National
- |
  Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, other departments and agencies
- |
  of the Government, educational institutions, and many industrial
- |
  organizations. There have been numerous cases of independent
- |
  discovery of the same truth in different places. To permit the release
- |
  of information by one agency and to continue to restrict it elsewhere
- |
  would be unfair in its effect and would tend to impair the morale and
- |
  efficiency of scientists who have submerged individual interests
- |
  in the controls and restrictions of war.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  A part of the information now classified which should be released
- |
  is possessed jointly by our allies and ourselves. Plans for release
- |
  of such information should be coordinated with our allies to minimize
- |
  danger of international friction which would result from sporadic
- |
  uncontrolled release.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- " A Board to Control Release  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The agency responsible for recommending the release of information from
- |
  military classification should be an Army, Navy, civilian body,
- |
  well grounded in science and technology. It should be competent
- |
  to advise the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy. It
- |
  should, moreover, have sufficient recognition to secure prompt and
- |
  practical decisions.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  To satisfy these considerations I recommend the establishment of
- |
  a Board, made up equally of scientists and military men, whose
- |
  function would be to pass upon the declassification and to control
- |
  the release for publication of scientific information which is now classified.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- " Publication Should Be Encouraged  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The release of information from security regulations is but
- |
  one phase of the problem. The other is to provide for
- |
  preparation of the material and its publication in a form and at a price which
- |
  will facilitate dissemination and use. In the case of the Office
- |
  of Scientific Research and Development, arrangements have been
- |
  made for the preparation of manuscripts, while the staffs under our control
- |
  are still assembled and in possession of the records, as soon as the
- |
  pressure for production of results for this war has begun to relax.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  We should get this scientific material to scientists everywhere with great
- |
  promptness, and at as low a price as is consistent with suitable
- |
  format. We should also get it to the men studying overseas so that
- |
  they will know what has happened in their absence.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It is recommended that measures which will encourage and facilitate
- |
  the preparation and publication of reports be adopted forthwith
- |
  by all agencies, governmental and private, possessing scientific
- |
  information released from security control.

- |2+

- " Chapter 6 THE MEANS TO THE END  \n"
- |2+

- " New Responsibilities for Government  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  One lesson is clear from the reports of the several committees
- |
  attached as appendices. The Federal Government should accept new
- |
  responsibilities for promoting the creation of new scientific
- |
  knowledge and the development of scientific talent in our youth.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The extent and nature of these new responsibilities are set
- |
  forth in detail in the reports of the committees whose recommendations
- |
  in this regard are fully endorsed.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  In discharging these responsibilities Federal funds should be made
- |
  available. We have given much thought to the question of how plans for
- |
  the use of Federal funds may be arranged so that such funds will not drive
- |
  out of the picture funds from local governments, foundations, and
- |
  private donors. We believe that our proposals will minimize that
- |
  effect, but we do not think that it can be completely avoided. We
- |
  submit, however, that the nation's need for more and better scientific
- |
  research is such that the risk must be accepted.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It is also clear that the effective discharge of these responsibilities
- |
  will require the full attention of some over-all agency devoted
- |
  to that purpose. There should be a focal point within the Government
- |
  for a concerted program of assisting scientific research conducted
- |
  outside of Government. Such an agency should furnish the funds needed
- |
  to support basic research in the colleges and universities, should
- |
  coordinate where possible research programs on matters of utmost
- |
  importance to the national welfare, should formulate a national policy
- |
  for the Government toward science, should sponsor the interchange of
- |
  scientific information among scientists and laboratories both in
- |
  this country and abroad, and should ensure that the incentives to
- |
  research in industry and the universities are maintained. All of the
- |
  committees advising on these matters agree on the necessity for
- |
  such an agency.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- " The Mechanism  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  There are within Government departments many groups whose interests are
- |
  primarily those of scientific research. Notable examples are found
- |
  within the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Interior, and the
- |
  Federal Security Agency. These groups are concerned with science as
- |
  collateral and peripheral to the major problems of those Departments.
- |
  These groups should remain where they are, and continue to perform
- |
  their present functions, including the support of agricultural
- |
  research by grants to the Land Grant Colleges and Experiment Stations,
- |
  since their largest contribution lies in applying fundamental
- |
  knowledge to the special problems of the Departments within which
- |
  they are established.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  By the same token these groups cannot be made the repository of
- |
  the new and large responsibilities in science which belong to the
- |
  Government and which the Government should accept. The recommendations
- |
  in this report which relate to research within the Government, to the
- |
  release of scientific information, to clarification of the tax laws,
- |
  and to the recovery and development of our scientific talent now
- |
  in uniform can be implemented by action within the existing
- |
  structure of the Government. But nowhere in the Governmental structure
- |
  receiving its funds from Congress is there an agency adapted to
- |
  supplementing the support of basic research in the universities,
- |
  both in medicine and the natural sciences; adapted to supporting
- |
  research on new weapons for both Services; or adapted to
- |
  administering a program of science scholarships and fellowships.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  A new agency should be established, therefore, by the Congress
- |
  for the purpose. Such an agency, moreover, should be an independent
- |
  agency devoted to the support of scientific research and advanced
- |
  scientific education alone. Industry learned many years ago that basic
- |
  research cannot often be fruitfully conducted as an adjunct
- |
  to or a subdivision of an operating agency or department. Operating
- |
  agencies have immediate operating goals and are under constant
- |
  pressure to produce in a tangible way, for that is the test of their
- |
  value. None of these conditions is favorable to basic research.
- |
  research is the exploration of the unknown and is necessarily
- |
  speculative. It is inhibited by conventional approaches, traditions,
- |
  and standards. It cannot be satisfactorily conducted in an
- |
  atmosphere where it is gauged and tested by operating or production
- |
  standards. Basic scientific research should not, therefore, be
- |
  placed under an operating agency whose paramount concern is anything
- |
  other than research. Research will always suffer when put in
- |
  competition with operations. The decision that there should be a
- |
  new and independent agency was reached by each of the committees
- |
  advising in these matters.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  I am convinced that these new functions should be centered in one agency.
- |
  Science is fundamentally a unitary thing. The number of independent
- |
  agencies should be kept to a minimum. Much medical progress,
- |
  for example, will come from fundamental advances in chemistry.
- |
  Separation of the sciences in tight compartments, as would occur
- |
  if more than one agency were involved, would retard and not
- |
  advance scientific knowledge as a whole.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- " Five Fundamentals  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  There are certain basic principles which must underlie the program
- |
  of Government support for scientific research and education if
- |
  such support is to be effective and if it is to avoid impairing
- |
  the very things we seek to foster. These principles are as
- |
  follows:
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  (1) Whatever the extent of support may be, there must be stability of
- |
  funds over a period of years so that long-range programs may be undertaken.
- |
  (2) The agency to administer such funds should be composed of citizens
- |
  selected only on the basis of their interest in and capacity to
- |
  promote the work of the agency. They should be persons of broad interest
- |
  in and understanding of the peculiarities of scientific research and
- |
  education.
- |
  (3) The agency should promote research through contracts or grants
- |
  to organizations outside the Federal Government. It should not operate
- |
  any laboratories of its own.
- |
  (4) Support of basic research in the public and private colleges,
- |
  universities, and research institutes must leave the internal
- |
  control of policy, personnel, and the method and scope of the research
- |
  to the institutions themselves. This is of the utmost importance.
- |
  (5) While assuring complete independence and freedom for the nature,
- |
  scope, and methodology of research carried on in the institutions
- |
  receiving public funds, and while retaining discretion in the allocation
- |
  of funds among such institutions, the Foundation proposed herein
- |
  must be responsible to the President and the Congress. Only through such
- |
  responsibility can we maintain the proper relationship between
- |
  science and other aspects of a democratic system. The usual controls
- |
  of audits, reports, budgeting, and the like, should, of course, apply
- |
  to the administrative and fiscal operations of the Foundation, subject,
- |
  however, to such adjustments in procedure as are necessary to meet
- |
  the special requirements of research.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Basic research is a long-term process - it ceases to be basic if immediate
- |
  results are expected on short-term support. Methods should therefore
- |
  be found which will permit the agency to make commitments of funds
- |
  from current appropriations for programs of five years duration or
- |
  longer. Continuity and stability of the program and its support may
- |
  be expected (a) from the growing realization by the Congress of
- |
  the benefits to the public from scientific research, and (b) from
- |
  the conviction which will grow among those who conduct research under the
- |
  auspices of the agency that good quality work will be followed by
- |
  continuing support.

- " Military Research  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  As stated earlier in this report, military preparedness requires a
- |
  permanent, independent, civilian-controlled organization, having close
- |
  liaison with the Army and Navy, but with funds direct from Congress
- |
  and the clear power to initiate military research which will
- |
  supplement and strengthen that carried on directly under the control
- |
  of the Army and Navy. As a temporary measure the National Academy
- |
  of Sciences has established the Research Board for National Security
- |
  at the request of the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy.
- |
  This is highly desirable in order that there may be no interruption
- |
  in the relations between scientists and military men after the emergency
- |
  wartime Office of Scientific Research and Development goes out
- |
  of existence. The Congress is now considering legislation to provide
- |
  funds for this Board by direct appropriation.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  I believe that, as a permanent measure, it would be appropriate to
- |
  add to the agency needed to perform the other functions recommended
- |
  in this report the responsibilities for civilian-initiated and
- |
  civilian-controlled military research. The function of such a
- |
  civilian group would be primarily to conduct long-range scientific
- |
  research on military problems - leaving to the Services research
- |
  on the improvement of existing weapons.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Some research on military problems should be conducted, in time of
- |
  peace as well as in war, by civilians independently of the
- |
  military establishment. It is the primary responsibility of the
- |
  Army and Navy to train the men, make available the weapons, and
- |
  employ the strategy that will bring victory in combat. The Armed
- |
  Services cannot be expected to be experts in all of the complicated
- |
  fields which make it possible for a great nation to fight successfully
- |
  in total war. There are certain kinds of research - such as
- |
  research on the improvement of existing weapons - which can
- |
  best be done within the military establishment. However, the job
- |
  of long-range research involving application of the newest
- |
  scientific discoveries to military needs should be the responsibility
- |
  of those civilian scientists in the universities and in industry
- |
  who are best trained to discharge it thoroughly and successfully. It is
- |
  essential that both kinds of research go forward and that
- |
  there be the closest liaison between the two groups.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Placing the civilian military research function in the proposed agency
- |
  would bring it into close relationship with a broad program
- |
  of basic research in both the natural sciences and medicine. A
- |
  balance between military and other research could thus readily
- |
  be maintained.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The establishment of the new agency, including a civilian military
- |
  research group, should not be delayed by the existence of
- |
  the Research Board for National Security, which is a temporary
- |
  measure. Nor should the creation of the new agency be delayed
- |
  by uncertainties in regard to the postwar organization of our
- |
  military departments themselves. Clearly, the new agency, including
- |
  a civilian military research group within it, can remain sufficiently
- |
  flexible to adapt its operations to whatever may be the final
- |
  organization of the military departments.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- " National Research Foundation  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It is my judgment that the national interest in scientific research
- |
  and scientific education can best be promoted by the creation of a
- |
  National Research Foundation.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  I. Purposes. - The National Research Foundation should develop
- |
  and promote a national policy for scientific research and
- |
  scientific education, should support basic research in nonprofit
- |
  organizations, should develop scientific talent in American youth by
- |
  means of scholarships and fellowships, and should by contract
- |
  and otherwise support long-range research on military matters.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  II. Members. - 1. Responsibility to the people, through the President
- |
  and Congress, should be placed in the hands of, say nine
- |
  Members, who should be persons not otherwise connected with the
- |
  Government and not representative of any special interest, who
- |
  should be known as National Research Foundation Members, selected
- |
  by the President on the basis of their interest in and capacity
- |
  to promote the purposes of the Foundation.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  2. The terms of the Members should be, say, 4 years, and no
- |
  Member should be eligible for immediate reappointment provided
- |
  he has served a full 4-year term. It should be arranged that
- |
  the Members first appointed serve terms of such length that at least
- |
  two Members are appointed each succeeding year.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  3. The Members should serve without compensation but should be
- |
  entitled to their expenses incurred in the performance of their
- |
  duties.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  4. The Members should elect their own chairman annually.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  5. The chief executive officer of the Foundation should be a
- |
  director appointed by the Members. Subject to the direction and
- |
  supervision of the Foundation Members (acting as a board), the
- |
  director should discharge all the fiscal, legal, and administrative
- |
  functions of the Foundation. The director should receive a
- |
  salary that is fully adequate to attract an outstanding man to the post.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  6. There should be an administrative office responsible to the
- |
  director to handle in one place the fiscal, legal, personnel, and
- |
  other similar administrative functions necessary to the accomplishment
- |
  of the purposes of the Foundation.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  7. With the exception of the director, the division members, and
- |
  one executive officer appointed by the director to administer
- |
  the affairs of each division, all employees of the Foundation should
- |
  be appointed under Civil Service regulations.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  III. Organization. - 1. In order to accomplish the purposes of the Foundation
- |
  the Members should establish several professional Divisions to
- |
  be responsible to the Members. At the outset these Divisions should be:
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  a. Division of Medical Research. - The function of this Division should
- |
  be to support medical research.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  b. Division of Natural Sciences. - The function of this Division should
- |
  be to support research in the physical and natural sciences.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  c. Division of National Defense. - It should be the function of this
- |
  Division to support long-range scientific research on military matters.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  d. Division of Scientific Personnel and Education. - It should be the function
- |
  of this Division to support and to supervise the grant of scholarships and
- |
  fellowships in science.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  e. Division of Publications and Scientific Collaboration. - This Division
- |
  should be charged with encouraging the publication of scientific knowledge
- |
  and promoting international exchange of scientific information.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  2. Each Division of the Foundation should be made up of at least
- |
  five members, appointed by the Members of the Foundation. In making such
- |
  appointments the Members should request and consider recommendations from
- |
  the National Academy of Sciences which should be asked to establish a
- |
  new National Research Foundation nominating committee in order to bring together
- |
  the recommendations of scientists in all organizations. The chairman of each
- |
  Division should be appointed by the Members of the Foundation.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  3. The division Members should be appointed for such terms as the Members
- |
  of the Foundation may determine, and may be reappointed at the discretion
- |
  of the Members. They should receive their expenses and compensation for their
- |
  services at a per diem rate of, say, $50 while engaged on business of
- |
  the Foundation, but no division member should receive more than, say,
- |
  $10,000 compensation per year.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  4. Membership of the Division of National Defense should include, in
- |
  addition to, say, five civilian members, one representative designated
- |
  by the Secretary of War, and one representative of the Secretary of the
- |
  Navy, who should serve without additional compensation for this duty.

  IV. Functions. - 1. The Members of the Foundation should have the following
- |
  functions, powers, and duties:
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  a. To formulate over-all policies of the Foundation.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  b. To establish and maintain such offices within the United States,
- |
  its territories and possessions, as they may deem necessary.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  c. To meet and function at any place within the United States, its
- |
  territories and possessions.
- |2+

  e. To adopt, promulgate, amend, and rescind rules and regulations
- |
  to carry out the provisions of the legislation and the policies
- |
  and practices of the Foundation.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  f. To review and balance the financial requirements of the several Divisions
- |
  and to propose to the President the annual estimate for the
- |
  funds required by each Division. Appropriations should be earmarked
- |
  for the purposes of specific Divisions, but the Foundation should
- |
  be left discretion with respect to the expenditure of each Division's
- |
  funds.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  g. To make contracts or grants for the conduct of research by negotiation
- |
  without advertising for bids.
- |2+

- |
  And with the advice of the National Research Foundation Divisions
- |
  concerned -
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  h. To create such advisory and cooperating agencies and councils,
- |
  state, regional, or national, as in their judgment will aid in
- |
  effectuating the purposes of the legislation, and to pay the
- |
  expenses thereof.

- |2+

- |
  k. To initiate and finance in appropriate organizations research projects
- |
  for which existing facilities are unavailable or inadequate.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  l. To establish scholarships and fellowships in the natural sciences
- |
  including biology and medicine.

- |
  aid for international meetings, associations of scientific societies,
- |
  and scientific research programs organized on an international basis.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  o. To devise and promote the use of methods of improving the transition
- |
  between research and its practical application in industry.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  2. The Divisions should be responsible to the Members of the Foundation
- "for - \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  a. Formulation of programs and policy within the scope of the particular
- |
  Divisions.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  b. Recommendations regarding the allocation of research programs
- |
  among research organizations.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  c. Recommendation of appropriate arrangements between the Foundation
- |
  and the organizations selected to carry on the program.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  d. Recommendation of arrangements with State and local authorities
- |
  in regard to cooperation in a program of science scholarships
- |
  and fellowships.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  e. Periodic review of the quality of research being conducted under
- |
  the auspices of the particular Division and revision of the program
- |
  of support of research.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  f. Presentation of budgets of financial needs for the work of the Division.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  g. Maintaining liaison with other scientific research agencies, both
- |
  governmental and private, concerned with the work of the Division.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  V. Patent Policy. - The success of the National Research Foundation
- |
  in promoting scientific research in this country will depend to a very
- |
  large degree upon the cooperation of organizations outside the
- |
  Government. In making contracts with or grants to such organizations
- |
  the Foundation should protect the public interest adequately and at
- |
  the same time leave the cooperating organization with adequate freedom
- |
  and incentive to conduct scientific research. The public interest will
- |
  normally be adequately protected if the Government receives a royalty-free
- |
  license for governmental purposes under any patents resulting from work
- |
  financed by the Foundation. There should be no obligation on the research
- |
  institution to patent discoveries made as a result of support from the
- |
  Foundation. There should certainly not be any absolute requirement that
- |
  all rights in such discoveries be assigned to the Government, but it should
- |
  be left to the discretion of the director and the interested Division
- |
  whether in special cases the public interest requires such an assignment.
- |
  Legislation on this point should leave to the Members of the
- |
  Foundation discretion as to its patent policy in order that patent arrangements
- |
  may be adjusted as circumstances and the public interest require.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  VI. Special Authority. - In order to insure that men of great competence
- |
  and experience may be designated as Members of the Foundation and as members
- |
  of the several professional Divisions, the legislation creating
- |
  the Foundation should contain specific authorization so that the Members
- |
  of the Foundation and the Members of the Divisions may also engage
- |
  in private and gainful employment, notwithstanding the provisions
- |
  of any other laws: provided, however, that no compensation for such
- |
  employment is received in any form from any profit-making institution
- |
  which receives funds under contract, or otherwise, from the Division or
- |
  Divisions of the Foundation with which the individual is concerned.
- |
  In normal times, in view of the restrictive statutory prohibitions
- |
  against dual interests on the part of Government officials, it would
- |
  be virtually impossible to persuade persons having private employment
- |
  of any kind to serve the Government in an official capacity. In order,
- |
  however, to secure the part-time services of the most competent
- |
  men as Members of the Foundation and the Divisions, these stringent
- |
  prohibitions should be relaxed to the extent indicated.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Since research is unlike the procurement of standardized items, which
- |
  are susceptible to competitive bidding on fixed specifications, the
- |
  legislation creating the National Research Foundation should free the
- |
  Foundation from the obligation to place its contracts for research through
- |
  advertising for bids. This is particularly so since the measure of
- |
  a successful research contract lies not in the dollar cost but in
- |
  the qualitative and quantitative contribution which is made to
- |
  our knowledge. The extent of this contribution in turn depends on
- |
  the creative spirit and talent which can be brought to bear within a
- |
  research laboratory. The National Research Foundation must, therefore, be
- |
  free to place its research contracts or grants not only with those
- |
  institutions which have a demonstrated research capacity but also with
- |
  other institutions whose latent talent or creative atmosphere affords
- |
  promise of research success.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  As in the case of the research sponsored during the war by the Office
- |
  of Scientific Research and Development, the research sponsored by
- |
  the National Research Foundation should be conducted, in general,
- |
  on an actual cost basis without profit to the institution receiving
- |
  the research contract or grant.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  There is one other matter which requires special mention. Since research does
- |
  not fall within the category of normal commercial or procurement
- |
  operations which are easily covered by the usual contractual relations,
- |
  it is essential that certain statutory and regulatory fiscal
- |
  requirements be waived in the case of research contractors. For example,
- |
  the National Research Foundation should be authorized by legislation
- |
  to make, modify, or amend contracts of all kinds with or without
- |
  legal consideration, and without performance bonds. Similarly, advance
- |
  payments should be allowed in the discretion of the Director
- |
  of the Foundation when required. Finally, the normal vouchering requirements
- |
  of the General Accounting Office with respect to detailed itemization or
- |
  substantiation of vouchers submitted under cost contracts should be
- |
  relaxed for research contractors. Adherence to the usual procedures
- |
  in the case of research contracts will impair the efficiency of research
- |
  operations and will needlessly increase the cost of the work of the
- |
  Government. Without the broad authority along these lines which was
- |
  contained in the First War Powers Act and its implementing Executive
- |
  Orders, together with the special relaxation of vouchering requirements
- |
  granted by the General Accounting Office, the Office of Scientific
- |
  Research and Development would have been gravely handicapped in carrying
- |
  on research on military matters during this war. Colleges and universities
- |
  in which research will be conducted principally under contract with the
- |
  Foundation are, unlike commercial institutions, not equipped to handle
- |
  the detailed vouchering procedures and auditing technicalities which
- |
  are required of the usual Government contractors.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  VII. Budget. - Studies by the several committees provide a partial
- |
  basis for making an estimate of the order of magnitude of
- |
  the funds required to implement the proposed program. Clearly the program
- |
  should grow in a healthy manner from modest beginnings. The following
- |
  very rough estimates are given for the first year of operation after the
- |
  Foundation is organized and operating, and for the fifth year of operation
- |
  when it is expected that the operations would have reached a fairly
- |
  stable level:

- " Action by Congress  \n"
- |2+

- |
  The National Research Foundation herein proposed meets the urgent need
- |
  of the days ahead. The form of the organization suggested is the
- |
  result of considerable deliberation. The form is important. The very
- |
  successful pattern of organization of the National Advisory Committee
- |
  for Aeronautics, which has promoted basic research on problems of flight
- |
  during the past thirty years, has been carefully considered in proposing
- |
  the method of appointment of Members of the Foundation and in defining
- |
  their responsibilities. Moreover, whatever program is established it
- |
  is vitally important that it satisfy the Five Fundamentals.
- |2+

- |
  The Foundation here proposed has been described only in outline. The
- |
  excellent reports of the committees which studied these matters are
- |
  attached as appendices. They will be of aid in furnishing detailed
- |
  suggestions.
- |2+

- |
  Legislation is necessary. It should be drafted with great care. Early
- |
  action is imperative, however, if this nation is to meet the
- |
  challenge of science and fully utilize the potentialities of science. On
- |
  the wisdom with which we bring science to bear against the problems
- |
  of the coming years depends in large measure our future as a nation.
- "  In a letter dated November 17, 1944, President Roosevelt requested my \n"
- |
  recommendations on the following points:
- |2+

- |2
    (1) What can be done, consistent with military security, and with the prior
- |
  approval of the military authorities, to make known to the world as soon as
- |
  possible the contributions which have been made during our war effort to
- |
  scientific knowledge?
- |2+

- |2
    (2) With particular reference to the war of science against disease, what
- |
  can be done now to organize a program for continuing in the future the work
- |
  which has been done in medicine and related sciences?
- |2+

- "  (3) What can the Government do now and in the future to aid research \n"
- |
  activities by public and private organizations?
- |2+

- |2
    (4) Can an effective program be proposed for discovering and developing
- |
  scientific talent in American youth so that the continuing future of scientific
- "research in this country may be assured on a level comparable to what has \n"
- |
  been done during the war?
- |2+

- |2
    It is clear from President Roosevelt's letter that in speaking of science
- |
  that he had in mind the natural sciences, including biology and medicine,
- "and I have so interpreted his questions.  Progress in other fields, such \n"
- |
  as the social sciences and the humanities, is likewise important; but the
- |
  program for science presented in my report warrants immediate attention.
- |2+

- "  In seeking answers to President Roosevelt's questions I have had the \n"
- "assistance of distinguished committees specially qualified to advise in \n"
- |
  respect to these subjects.  The committees have given these matters the
- "serious attention they deserve; indeed, they have regarded this as an \n"
- |
  opportunity to participate in shaping the policy of the country with reference
- |
  to scientific research.  They have had many meetings and have submitted formal
- "reports.  I have been in close touch with the work of the committees and \n"
- |
  with their members throughout.  I have examined all of the data they assembled
- |
  and the suggestions they submitted on the points raised in President Roosevelt's
- |
  letter.
- |2+

- |2
    Although the report which I submit herewith is my own, the facts, conclusions,
- |
  and recommendations are based on the findings of the committees which have
- |
  studied these questions.  Since my report is necessarily brief, I am including
- |
  as appendices the full reports of the committees.
- |2+

- |2
    A single mechanism for implementing the recommendations of the several
- |
  committees is essential.  In proposing such a mechanism I have departed somewhat
- |
  from the specific recommendations of the committees, but I have since been
- |
  assured that the plan I am proposing is fully acceptable to the committee
- |
  members.
- |2+

- "  The pioneer spirit is still vigorous within this nation.  Science offers a \n"
- |
  largely unexplored hinterland for the pioneer who has the tools for his task.
- |
  The rewards of such exploration both for the Nation and the individual are
- |
  great.  Scientific progress is one essential key to our security as a nation,
- |
  to our better health, to more jobs, to a higher standard of living, and to
- |
  our cultural progress.
- |2+

- |2
    There is, however, no reason why the lessons to be found in this experiment
- "cannot be profitably employed in times of peace.  The information, the \n"
- |
  techniques, and the research experience developed by the Office of Scientific
- |
  Research and Development and by the thousands of scientists in the universities
- "and in private industry, should be used in the days of peace ahead for the \n"
- |
  improvement of the national health, the creation of new enterprises bringing
- |
  new jobs, and the betterment of the national standard of living.
- |2+

- "  It is with that objective in mind that I would like to have your \n"
- |
  recommendations on the following four major points:
- |2+

- |2
    First: What can be done, consistent with military security, and with the prior
- |
  approval of the military authorities, to make known to the world as soon as
- |
  possible the contributions which have been made during our war effort to
- |
  scientific knowledge?
- |2+

- |2
    The diffusion of such knowledge should help us stimulate new enterprises,
- |
  provide jobs four our returning servicemen and other workers, and make possible
- |
  great strides for the improvement of the national well-being.
- |2+

- |2
    Second: With particular reference to the war of science against disease, what
- |
  can be done now to organize a program for continuing in the future the work
- |
  which has been done in medicine and related sciences?
- |2+

- |2
    The fact that the annual deaths in this country from one or two diseases
- |
  alone are far in excess of the total number of lives lost by us in battle
- |
  during this war should make us conscious of the duty we owe future generations.
- |2+

- |2
    Third: What can the Government do now and in the future to aid research
- "activities by public and private organizations?  The proper roles of public \n"
- "and of private research, and their interrelation, should be carefully \n"
- |
  considered.
- |2+

- |2
    Fourth: Can an effective program be proposed for discovering and developing
- |
  scientific talent in American youth so that the continuing future of scientific
- |
  research in this country may be assured on a level comparable to what has
- |
  been done during the war?
- |2+

- |2
    New frontiers of the mind are before us, and if they are pioneered with the
- |
  same vision, boldness, and drive with which we have waged this war we can
- |
  create a fuller and more fruitful employment and a fuller and more fruitful
- |
  life.
- |2+

- |2
    I hope that, after such consultation as you may deem advisable with your
- |
  associates and others, you can let me have your considered judgment on these
- |
  matters as soon as convenient - reporting on each when you are ready, rather
- |
  than waiting for completion of your studies in all.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  "New frontiers of the mind are before us, and if they are pioneered with the
- |
  same vision, boldness, and drive with which we have waged this war we can
- |
  create a fuller and more fruitful employment and a fuller and more fruitful
- |
  life."--
- |2+

- |2+

- |2
    Progress in the war against disease depends upon a flow of new scientific
- |
  knowledge.  New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous
- |
  additions to knowledge of the laws of nature, and the application of that
- |
  knowledge to practical purposes.  Similarly, our defense against aggression
- |
  demands new knowledge so that we can develop new and improved weapons.  This
- "essential, new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific \n"
- |
  research.
- |2+

- |2
    Science can be effective in the national welfare only as a member of a team,
- |
  whether the conditions be peace or war.   But without scientific progress no
- |
  amount of achievement in other directions can insure our health, prosperity,
- |
  and security as a nation in the modern world.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- " \n"
- |2
    We have taken great strides in the war against disease.  The death rate for
- |
  all diseases in the Army, including overseas forces, has been reduced from 14.1
- |
  per thousand in the last war to 0.6 per thousand in this war.  In the last
- "40 years life expectancy has increased from 49 to 65 years, largely as a \n"
- |
  consequence of the reduction in the death rates of infants and children.  But
- |
  we are far from the goal.  The annual deaths from one or two diseases far
- |
  exceed the total number of American lives lost in battle during this war.
- "A large fraction of these deaths in our civilian population cut short the \n"
- |
  useful lives of our citizens.  Approximately 7,000,000 persons in the United
- |
  States are mentally ill and their care costs the public over $175,000,000 a
- |
  year.  Clearly much illness remains for which adequate means of prevention and
- |
  cure are not yet known.
- |2+

- |2
    The responsibility for basic research in medicine and the underlying sciences,
- |
  so essential to progress in the war against disease, falls primarily upon
- |
  the medical schools and universities.  Yet we find that the traditional
- |
  sources of support for medical research in the medical schools and universities,
- "largely endowment income, foundation grants, and private donations, are \n"
- "diminishing and there is no immediate prospect of a change in this trend.  \n"
- |
  Meanwhile, the cost of medical research has been rising.  If we are to maintain
- |
  the progress in medicine which has marked the last 25 years, the Government
- |
  should extend financial support to basic medical research in the medical
- |
  schools and in universities.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2
    The bitter and dangerous battle against the U-boat was a battle of
- |
  scientific techniques - and our margin of success was dangerously small.
- |
  The new eyes which radar has supplied can sometimes be blinded by
- |
  new scientific developments. V-2 was countered only by capture of
- |
  the launching sites.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2
    We cannot again rely on our allies to hold off the enemy while we
- |
  struggle to catch up. There must be more - and more adequate - military
- |
  research in peacetime. It is essential that the civilian scientists
- |
  continue in peacetime some portion of those contributions to national
- |
  security which they have made so effectively during the war. This
- |
  can best be done through a civilian-controlled organization with close
- |
  liaison with the Army and Navy, but with funds direct from Congress, and
- |
  the clear power to initiate military research which will supplement and
- |
  strengthen that carried on directly under the control of the Army and
- |
  Navy.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  One of our hopes is that after the war there will be full employment.
- |
  To reach that goal the full creative and productive energies of the American
- |
  people must be released. To create more jobs we must make new and better
- |
  and cheaper products. We want plenty of new, vigorous enterprises. But new
- |
  products and processes are not born full-grown. They are founded on new
- |
  principles and new conceptions which in turn result from basic scientific
- |
  research. Basic scientific research is scientific capital. Moreover, we
- |
  cannot any longer depend upon Europe as a major source of this scientific
- |
  capital. Clearly, more and better scientific research is one essential to the
- |
  achievement of our goal of full employment.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  How do we increase this scientific capital? First, we must have plenty
- |
  of men and women trained in science, for upon them depends both the
- |
  creation of new knowledge and its application to practical purposes. Second,
- |
  we must strengthen the centers of basic research which are principally the
- |
  colleges, universities, and research institutes. These institutions provide
- |
  the environment which is most conducive to the creation of new scientific
- |
  knowledge and least under pressure for immediate, tangible results. With
- |
  some notable exceptions, most research in industry and Government involves
- |
  application of existing scientific knowledge to practical problems. It is
- |
  only the colleges, universities, and a few research institutes that devote
- |
  most of their research efforts to expanding the frontiers of knowledge.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Expenditures for scientific research by industry and Government increased from
- |
  $140,000,000 in 1930 to $309,000,000 in 1940. Those for the colleges and
- |
  universities increased from $20,000,000 to $31,000,000, while those for the
- |
  research institutes declined from $5,200,000 to $4,500,000 during the same
- |
  period. If the colleges, universities, and research institutes are to meet
- |
  the rapidly increasing demands of industry and Government for new
- |
  scientific knowledge, their basic research should be strengthened by use
- |
  of public funds.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  For science to serve as a powerful factor in our national welfare, applied
- |
  research both in Government and in industry must be vigorous. To improve
- |
  the quality of scientific research within the Government, steps should be
- |
  taken to modify the procedures for recruiting, classifying, and compensating
- |
  scientific personnel in order to reduce the present handicap of governmental
- |
  scientific bureaus in competing with industry and the universities for
- |
  top-grade scientific talent. To provide coordination of the common
- |
  scientific activities of these governmental agencies as to policies and
- |
  budgets, a permanent Science Advisory Board should be created to advise
- |
  the executive and legislative branches of Government on these matters.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The most important ways in which the Government can promote industrial
- |
  research are to increase the flow of new scientific knowledge through support
- |
  of basic research, and to aid in the development of scientific talent.
- |
  In addition, the Government should provide suitable incentives to industry
- |
  to conduct research, (a) by clarification of present uncertainties
- |
  in the Internal Revenue Code in regard to the deductibility of research
- |
  and development expenditures as current charges against net income, and
- |
  (b) by strengthening the patent system so as to eliminate uncertainties
- |
  which now bear heavily on small industries and so as to prevent abuses
- |
  which reflect discredit upon a basically sound system. In addition, ways
- |
  should be found to cause the benefits of basic research to reach industries
- |
  which do not now utilize new scientific knowledge.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The responsibility for the creation of new scientific knowledge - and for most
- |
  of its application - rests on that small body of men and women who
- |
  understand the fundamental laws of nature and are skilled in the techniques
- |
  of scientific research. We shall have rapid or slow advance on any scientific
- |
  frontier depending on the number of highly qualified and trained scientists
- |
  exploring it.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The deficit of science and technology students who, but for the war, would
- |
  have received bachelor's degrees is about 150,000. It is estimated that
- |
  the deficit of those obtaining advanced degrees in these fields will amount
- |
  in 1955 to about 17,000 - for it takes at least 6 years from college entry
- |
  to achieve a doctor's degree or its equivalent in science or engineering.
- |
  The real ceiling on our productivity of new scientific knowledge and its
- |
  application in the war against disease, and the development of new
- |
  products and new industries, is the number of trained scientists available.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The training of a scientist is a long and expensive process. Studies clearly
- |
  show that there are talented individuals in every part of the population,
- |
  but with few exceptions, those without the means of buying higher education
- |
  go without it. If ability, and not the circumstance of family fortune,
- |
  determines who shall receive higher education in science, then we
- |
  shall be assured of constantly improving quality at every level of
- |
  scientific activity. The Government should provide a reasonable number of
- |
  undergraduate scholarships and graduate fellowships in order to develop
- |
  scientific talent in American youth. The plans should be designed to attract
- |
  into science only that proportion of youthful talent appropriate to the
- |
  needs of science in relation to the other needs of the nation for high
- |
  abilities.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The most immediate prospect of making up the deficit in scientific personnel
- |
  is to develop the scientific talent in the generation now in uniform. Even
- |
  if we should start now to train the current crop of high-school graduates
- |
  none would complete graduate studies before 1951. The Armed Services should
- |
  comb their records for men who, prior to or during the war, have given
- |
  evidence of talent for science, and make prompt arrangements, consistent
- |
  with current discharge plans, for ordering those who remain in uniform,
- |
  as soon as militarily possible, to duty at institutions here and overseas where
- |
  they can continue their scientific education. Moreover, the Services should
- |
  see that those who study overseas have the benefit of the latest scientific
- |
  information resulting from research during the war.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  While most of the war research has involved the application of
- |
  existing scientific knowledge to the problems of war, rather than basic
- |
  research, there has been accumulated a vast amount of information
- |
  relating to the application of science to particular problems. Much
- |
  of this can be used by industry. It is also needed for teaching in
- |
  the colleges and universities here and in the Armed Forces Institutes
- |
  overseas. Some of this information must remain secret, but most of it
- |
  should be made public as soon as there is ground for belief that the
- |
  enemy will not be able to turn it against us in this war. To select that
- |
  portion which should be made public, to coordinate its release,
- |
  and definitely to encourage its publication, a Board composed of Army,
- |
  Navy, and civilian scientific members should be promptly established.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The Government should accept new responsibilities for promoting
- |
  the flow of new scientific knowledge and the development of
- |
  scientific talent in our youth. These responsibilities are the proper
- |
  concern of the Government, for they vitally affect our health, our
- |
  jobs, and our national security. It is in keeping also with basic United
- |
  States policy that the Government should foster the opening of new
- |
  frontiers and this is the modern way to do it. For many years the
- |
  Government has wisely supported research in the agricultural colleges
- |
  and the benefits have been great. The time has come when such support
- |
  should be extended to other fields.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The effective discharge of these new responsibilities will require
- |
  the full attention of some over-all agency devoted to that purpose. There
- |
  is not now in the permanent Governmental structure receiving its funds
- |
  from Congress an agency adapted to supplementing the support of basic
- |
  research in the colleges, universities, and research institutes,
- |
  both in medicine and the natural sciences, adapted to supporting research
- |
  on new weapons for both Services, or adapted to administering a program
- |
  of science scholarships and fellowships.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Therefore I recommend that a new agency for these purposes be established.
- |
  Such an agency should be composed of persons of broad interest and
- |
  experience, having an understanding of the peculiarities of scientific
- |
  research and scientific education. It should have stability of funds so
- |
  that long-range programs may be undertaken. It should recognize
- |
  that freedom of inquiry must be preserved and should leave internal
- |
  control of policy, personnel, and the method and scope of research to
- |
  the institutions in which it is carried on. It should be fully
- |
  responsible to the President and through him to the Congress for
- |
  its program.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Early action on these recommendations is imperative if this nation
- |
  is to meet the challenge of science in the crucial years ahead. On the
- |
  wisdom with which we bring science to bear in the war against disease,
- |
  in the creation of new industries, and in the strengthening of our
- |
  Armed Forces depends in large measure our future as a nation.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  We all know how much the new drug, penicillin, has meant to our grievously
- |
  wounded men on the grim battlefronts of this war - the countless lives it
- |
  has saved - the incalculable suffering which its use has prevented. Science
- |
  and the great practical genius of this nation made this achievement possible.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Some of us know the vital role which radar has played in bringing the United
- |
  Nations to victory over Nazi Germany and in driving the Japanese steadily
- |
  back from their island bastions. Again it was painstaking scientific research
- |
  over many years that made radar possible.
- |2+

- |2+

- "What we often forget are the millions of pay envelopes on a peacetime Saturday
  \n"
- |
  night which are filled because new products and new industries have provided
- |
  jobs for countless Americans.  Science made that possible, too.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  In 1939 millions of people were employed in industries which did not even
- |
  exist at the close of the last war - radio, air conditioning, rayon and other
- |
  synthetic fibers, and plastics are examples of the products of these industries.
- |
  But these things do not mark the end of progress - they are but the beginning
- |
  if we make full use of our scientific resources.  New manufacturing industries
- |
  can be started and many older industries greatly strengthened and expanded if
- "we continue to study nature's laws and apply new knowledge to practical \n"
- |
  purposes.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Great advances in agriculture are also based upon scientific research.  Plants
- |
  which are more resistant to disease and are adapted to short growing season,
- |
  the prevention and cure of livestock diseases, the control of our insect
- |
  enemies, better fertilizers, and improved agricultural practices, all stem
- |
  from painstaking scientific research.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Advances in science when put to practical use mean more jobs, higher wages,
- |
  shorter hours, more abundant crops, more leisure for recreation, for study,
- |
  for learning how to live without the deadening drudgery which has been the
- "burden of the common man for ages past.  Advances in science will also \n"
- "bring higher standards of living, will lead to the prevention or cure of \n"
- |
  diseases, will promote conservation of our limited national resources, and
- "will assure means of defense against aggression.  But to achieve these \n"
- |
  objectives - to secure a high level of employment, to maintain a position
- "of world leadership - the flow of new scientific knowledge must be both \n"
- |
  continuous and substantial.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Our population increased from 75 million to 130 million between 1900 and
- |
  1940. In some countries comparable increases have been accompanied by
- |
  famine. In this country the increase has been accompanied by
- |
  more abundant food supply, better living, more leisure, longer life, and
- |
  better health. This is, largely, the product of three factors - the free play of
- |
  initiative of a vigorous people under democracy, the heritage of great
- |
  national wealth, and the advance of science and its application.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Science, by itself, provides no panacea for individual, social, and economic
- |
  ills. It can be effective in the national welfare only as a member of a team,
- |
  whether the conditions be peace or war. But without scientific progress
- |
  no amount of achievement in other directions can insure our health,
- |
  prosperity, and security as a nation in the modern world.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It has been basic United States policy that Government should foster the
- |
  opening of new frontiers. It opened the seas to clipper ships and
- |
  furnished land for pioneers. Although these frontiers have more or less
- |
  disappeared, the frontier of science remains. It is in keeping with the
- |
  American tradition - one which has made the United States great -
- |
  that new frontiers shall be made accessible for development by
- |
  all American citizens.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Moreover, since health, well-being, and security are proper concerns of
- |
  Government, scientific progress is, and must be, of vital interest
- |
  to Government. Without scientific progress the national health would
- |
  deteriorate; without scientific progress we could not hope for
- |
  improvement in our standard of living or for an increased number of jobs
- |
  for our citizens; and without scientific progress we could not have maintained
- |
  our liberties against tyranny.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  From early days the Government has taken an active interest in scientific
- |
  matters. During the nineteenth century the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the
- |
  Naval Observatory, the Department of Agriculture, and the Geological
- |
  Survey were established. Through the Land Grant College acts the
- |
  Government has supported research in state institutions for more than 80 years
- |
  on a gradually increasing scale. Since 1900 a large number of scientific
- |
  agencies have been established within the Federal Government, until in 1939
- |
  they numbered more than 40.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Much of the scientific research done by Government agencies is intermediate
- |
  in character between the two types of work commonly referred to as
- |
  basic and applied research. Almost all Government scientific work has
- |
  ultimate practical objectives but, in many fields of broad national concern,
- |
  it commonly involves long-term investigation of a fundamental nature.
- |
  Generally speaking, the scientific agencies of Government are not so
- |
  concerned with immediate practical objectives as are the laboratories
- |
  of industry nor, on the other hand, are they as free to explore any
- |
  natural phenomena without regard to possible economic applications as
- |
  are the educational and private research institutions. Government scientific
- |
  agencies have splendid records of achievement, but they are limited
- |
  in function.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  We have no national policy for science. The Government has only begun
- |
  to utilize science in the nation's welfare. There is no body within the
- |
  Government charged with formulating or executing a national science
- |
  policy. There are no standing committees of the Congress devoted to
- |
  this important subject. Science has been in the wings. It should be brought to
- |
  the center of the stage - for in it lies much of our hope for the future.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  There are areas of science in which the public interest is acute but which
- |
  are likely to be cultivated inadequately if left without more support than
- |
  will come from private sources. These areas - such as research on military
- |
  problems, agriculture, housing, public health, certain medical research,
- |
  and research involving expensive capital facilities beyond the capacity
- |
  of private institutions - should be advanced by active Government support.
- |
  To date, with the exception of the intensive war research conducted by
- |
  the Office of Scientific Research and Development, such support has been
- |
  meager and intermittent.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  For reasons presented in this report we are entering a period when science
- |
  needs and deserves increased support from public funds.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The publicly and privately supported colleges, universities, and research
- |
  institutes are the centers of basic research. They are the wellsprings of
- |
  knowledge and understanding. As long as they are vigorous and healthy
- |
  and their scientists are free to pursue the truth wherever it may
- |
  lead, there will be a flow of new scientific knowledge to those who can apply
- |
  it to practical problems in Government, in industry, or elsewhere.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Many of the lessons learned in the war-time application of science under
- |
  Government can be profitably applied in peace. The Government is peculiarly
- |
  fitted to perform certain functions, such as the coordination and support of
- |
  broad programs on problems of great national importance. But we must proceed
- |
  with caution in carrying over the methods which work in wartime to the
- |
  very different conditions of peace. We must remove the rigid controls
- |
  which we have had to impose, and recover freedom of inquiry and that healthy
- |
  competitive scientific spirit so necessary for expansion of the frontiers
- |
  of scientific knowledge.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Scientific progress on a broad front results from the free play of free
- |
  intellects, working on subjects of their own choice, in the manner dictated
- |
  by their curiosity for exploration of the unknown. Freedom of inquiry
- |
  must be preserved under any plan for Government support of science
- |
  in accordance with the Five Fundamentals listed on
- |2
   page 26 .

- |
  The study of the momentous questions presented in President Roosevelt's
- |
  letter has been made by able committees working diligently. This report
- |
  presents conclusions and recommendations based upon the studies of
- |
  these committees which appear in full as the appendices. Only in the
- |
  creation of one over-all mechanism rather than several does this report
- |
  depart from the specific recommendations of the committees. The members of
- |
  the committees have reviewed the recommendations in regard to the single
- |
  mechanism and have found this plan thoroughly acceptable.

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The death rate for all diseases in the Army, including the overseas forces,
- |
  has been reduced from 14.1 per thousand in the last war to 0.6 per thousand
- "in this war. \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Such ravaging diseases as yellow fever, dysentery, typhus, tetanus, pneumonia,
- |
  and meningitis have been all but conquered by penicillin and the sulfa drugs,
- |
  the insecticide DDT, better vaccines, and improved hygenic measures.  Malaria
- |
  has been controlled.  There has been dramatic progress in surgery.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The striking advances in medicine during the war have been possible only because
- |
  we had a large backlog of scientific data accumulated through basic research
- |
  in many scientific fields in the years before the war.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  In the last 40 years life expectancy in the United States has increased from
- |
  49 to 65 years largely as a consequence of the reduction in the death rates of
- |
  infants and children; in the last 20 years the death rate from the diseases
- |
  of childhood has been reduced 87 percent.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Diabetes has been brought under control by insulin, pernicious anemia by
- |
  liver extracts; and the once widespread deficiency diseases have been much
- |
  reduced, even in the lowest income groups, by accessory food factors and
- |
  improvement of diet.  Notable advances have been made in the early diagnosis
- |
  of cancer, and in the surgical and radiation treatment of the disease.
- |2+

- |2+

- "These results have been achieved through a great amount of basic research \n"
- |
  in medicine and the preclinical sciences, and by the dissemination of this
- |
  new scientific knowledge through the physicians and medical services and
- |
  public health agencies of the country.  In this cooperative endeavour the
- |
  pharmaceutical industry has played an important role, especially during the
- |
  war.  All of the medical and public health groups share credit for these
- |
  achievements; they form interdependent members of a team.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Progress in combating disease depends upon an expanding body of new scientific
- |
  knowledge.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  As President Roosevelt observed, the annual deaths from one or two diseases
- |
  are far in excess of the total number of American lives lost in battle during
- |
  this war.  A large fraction of these deaths in our civilian population cut
- |
  short the useful lives of our citizens.  This is our present position despite
- "the fact that in the last three decades notable progress has been made in \n"
- |
  civilian medicine.  The reduction in death rate from diseases of childhood
- |
  has shifted the emphasis to the middle and old age groups, particularly to
- |
  the malignant diseases and the degenerative processes prominent in later
- |
  life.  Cardiovascular disease, including chronic disease of the kidneys,
- |
  arteriosclerosis, and cerebral hemorrhage, now account for 45 percent of the
- |
  deaths in the United States.  Second are the infectious diseases, and third
- |
  is cancer.  Added to these are many maladies (for example, the common cold,
- |
  arthritis, asthma and hay fever, peptic ulcer) which, through infrequently
- |
  fatal, cause incalculable disability.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Another aspect of the changing emphasis is the increase of mental diseases.
- |
  Approximately 7 million persons in the United States are mentally ill; more
- |
  than one-third of the hospital beds are occupied by such persons, at a cost
- |
  of $175 million a year.  Each year 125,000 new mental cases are hospitalized.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Notwithstanding great progress in prolonging the span of life and relief
- |
  of suffering, much illness remains for which adequate means of prevention
- "and cure are not yet known.  While additional physicians, hospitals, and \n"
- |
  health programs are needed, their full usefulness cannot be attained unless
- |
  we enlarge our knowledge of the human organism and the nature of disease.
- |
  Any extension of medical facilities must be accompanied by an expanded program
- |
  of medical training and research.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Discoveries pertinent to medical progress have often come from remote and
- |
  unexpected sources, and it is certain that this will be true in the future.
- |
  It is wholly probable that progress in the treatment of cardiovascular
- |
  disease, renal disease, cancer, and similar refractory diseases will be
- |
  made as the result of fundamental discoveries in subjects unrelated to those
- |
  diseases, and perhaps entirely unexpected by the investigator.  Further progress
- "requires that the entire front of medicine and the underlying sciences of \n"
- |
  chemistry, physics, anatomy, biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology,
- |
  bacteriology, pathology, parasitology, etc., be broadly developed.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Progress in the war against disease results from discoveries in remote and
- |
  unexpected fields of medicine and the underlying sciences.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- "Penicillin reached our troops in time to save countless lives because the \n"
- |
  Government coordinated and supported the program of research and development
- |
  on the drug.  The development moved from the early laboratory stage to large
- |
  scale production and use in a fraction of the time it would have taken without
- |
  such leadership.  The search for better anti-malarials, which proceeded at a
- |
  moderate tempo for many years, has been accelerated enormously by Government
- |
  support during the war.  Other examples can be cited in which medical progress
- |
  has been similarly advanced.  In achieving these results, the Government has
- |
  provided over-all coordination and support; it has not dictated how the work
- |
  should be done within any cooperating institution.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Discovery of new therapeutic agents and methods usually results from basic
- |
  studies in medicine and the underlying sciences.  The development of such
- |
  materials and methods to the point at which they become available to
- |
  medical practitioners requires teamwork involving the medical schools, the
- |
  science departments of universities, Government and the pharmaceutical
- |
  industry.  Government initiative, support, and coordination can be very
- |
  effective in this development phase.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Government initiative and support for the development of newly discovered
- |
  therapeutic materials and methods can reduce the time required to bring the
- |
  benefits to the public.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- "The primary place for medical research is in the medical schools and \n"
- |
  universities.  In some cases coordinated direct attack on special problems
- |
  may be made by teams of investigators, supplementing similar attacks carried
- |
  on by the Army, Navy, Public Health Service, and other organizations.  Apart
- "from teaching, however, the primary obligation of the medical schools and \n"
- "universities is to continue the traditional function of such institutions, \n"
- |
  namely,  to provide the individual worker with an opportunity for free,
- |
  untrammeled study of nature, in the directions and by the methods suggested
- |
  by his interests, curiosity, and imagination.  The history of medical science
- |
  teaches clearly the supreme importance of affording the prepared mind complete
- "freedom for the exercise of initiative.  It is the special province of the \n"
- |
  medical schools and universities to foster medical research in this way - a duty
- |
  which cannot be shifted to government agencies, industrial organizations, or
- |
  to any other institutions.
- |2+

- |2+

- "Where clinical investigations of the human body are required, the medical \n"
- "schools are in a unique position, because of their close relationship to \n"
- |
  teaching hospitals, to integrate such investigations with the work of the
- |
  departments of preclinical science, and to impart new knowledge to physicians
- |
  in training.  At the same time, the teaching hospitals are especially well
- |
  qualified to carry on medical research because of their close connection with
- |
  the medical schools, on which they depend for staff and supervision.
- |2+

- |2+

- "Between World War I and World War II the United States overtook all other \n"
- |
  nations in medical research and assumed a position of world leadership. To
- |
  a considerable extent this progress reflected the liberal financial support
- "from university endowment income, gifts from individuals, and foundation \n"
- |
  grants in the 20's.  The growth of research departments in medical schools
- |
  ahs been very uneven, however, and in consequence most of the important work
- |
  has been done in a few large schools.  This should be corrected by building up
- |
  the weaker institutions, especially in regions which now have no strong medical
- "research activities.  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The traditional sources of support for medical research, largely endowment
- |
  income, foundation grants, and private donations, are diminishing, and there is
- |
  no immediate prospect of a change in this trend.  Meanwhile, research costs have
- |
  steadily risen.  More elaborate and expensive equipment is required, supplies
- |
  are more costly, and the wages of assistants are higher.  Industry is only to
- |
  a limited extent a source of funds for basic medical research.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It is clear that if we are to maintain the progress in medicine which has
- |
  marked the last 25 years, the Government should extend financial support to
- |
  basic medical research in the medical schools and in the universities, through
- "grants both for research and for fellowships.  The amount which can be \n"
- |
  effectively spent in the first year should not exceed 5 million dollars.
- |
  After a program is under way perhaps 20 million dollars a year can be spent
- |
  effectively.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- " \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  In this war it has become clear beyond all doubt that scientific research is
- |
  absolutely essential to national security.  The bitter and dangerous battle
- |
  against the U-boat was a battle of scientific techniques - and our margin of
- |
  success was dangerously small.  The new eyes which radar supplied to our
- |
  fighting forces quickly evoked the development of scientific countermeasures
- |
  which could often blind them. This again represents the ever continuing battle
- |
  of techniques.  The V-1 attack on London was finally defeated by three devices
- |
  developed during this war and used superbly in the field.  V-2 was countered
- |
  only by the capture of the launching sites.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The Secretaries of War and Navy recently stated in a joint letter to the
- |
  National Academy of Sciences:
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  This war emphasizes three facts of supreme importance to national security:
- |
  (1) Powerful new tactics of defense and offense are developed around new
- |
  weapons created by scientific and engineering research; (2) the competitive
- |
  time element in developing those weapons and tactics may be decisive; (3) war
- |
  is increasingly total war, in which the armed services must be supplemented by
- |
  active participation of every element of civilian population.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  To insure continued preparedness along farsighted technical lines, the research
- |
  scientists of the country must be called upon to continue in peacetime some
- |
  substantial portion of those types of contribution to national security which
- |
  they have made so effectively during the stress of the present war * * *.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  There must be more - and more adequate - military research during peacetime.
- |
  We cannot again rely on our allies to hold off the enemy while we struggle
- |
  to catch up.  Further, it is clear that only the Government can undertake
- |
  military research; for it must be carried on in secret, much of it has no
- |
  commercial value, and it is expensive.  The obligation of Government to support
- |
  research on military problems is inescapable.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Modern war requires the use of the most advanced scientific techniques.  Many
- |
  of the leaders in the development of radar are scientists who before the war
- |
  had been exploring the nucleus of the atom.  While there must be increased
- |
  emphasis on science in the future training of officers for both the Army and
- |
  Navy, such men cannot be expected to be specialists in scientific research.
- |
  Therefore a professional partnership between the officers in the Services
- |
  and civilian scientists is needed.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The Army and Navy should continue to carry on research and development on the
- |
  improvement of current weapons.  For many years the National Advisory Committee
- |
  for Aeronautics has supplemented the work of the Army and Navy by conducting
- "basic research on the problems of flight.  There should now be permanent \n"
- |
  civilian activity to supplement the research work of the Services in other
- "scientific fields so as to carry on in time of peace some part of the \n"
- "activities of the emergency war-time Office of Scientific Research and \n"
- |
  Development.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Military preparedness requires a permanent independent, civilian-controlled
- |
  organization, having close liaison with the Army and Navy, but with funds
- |
  directly from Congress and with the clear power to initiate military research
- |
  which will supplement and strengthen that carried on directly under the control
- |
  of the Army and Navy.

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- "One of our hopes is that after the war there will be full employment, and \n"
- |
  that the production of goods and services will serve to raise our standard
- |
  of living.  We do not know yet how we shall reach that goal, but it is certain
- |
  that it can be achieved only by releasing the full creative and productive
- "energies of the American people. \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Surely we will not get there by standing still, merely by making the same
- |
  things we made before and selling them at the same or higher prices.  We
- "will not get ahead in international trade unless we offer new and more \n"
- "attractive and cheaper products. \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Where will these new products come from?  How will we find ways to make better
- |
  products at lower cost?  The answer is clear.  There must be a stream of new
- |
  scientific knowledge to turn the wheels of private and public enterprise.  There
- |
  must be plenty of men and women trained in science and technology for upon
- |
  them depend both the creation of new knowledge and its application to practical
- |
  purposes.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  More and better scientific research is essential to the achievement of our
- |
  goal of full employment.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Basic research is performed without thought of practical ends.  It results
- "in general knowledge and an understanding of nature and its laws.  This \n"
- |
  general knowledge provides the means of answering a large number of important
- |
  practical problems, though it may not give a complete specific answer to any
- |
  one of them.  The function of applied research is to provide such complete
- |
  answers.  The scientist doing basic research may not be at all interested in
- |
  the practical applications of his work, yet the further progress of industrial
- |
  development would eventually stagnate if basic scientific research were long
- "neglected. \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  One of the peculiarities of basic science is the variety of paths which lead
- |
  to productive advance.  Many of the most important discoveries have come as
- "a result of experiments undertaken with very different purposes in mind.  \n"
- |
  Statistically it is certain that important and highly useful discoveries will
- |
  result from some fraction of the undertakings in basic science; but the results
- |
  of any one particular investigation cannot be predicted with accuracy.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Basic research leads to new knowledge.  It provides scientific capital.  It
- |
  creates the fund from which the practical applications of knowledge must be
- |
  drawn.  New products and new processes do not appear full-grown.  They are
- |
  founded on new principles and new conceptions, which in turn are painstakingly
- |
  developed by research in the purest realms of science.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Today, it is truer than ever that basic research is the pacemaker of
- |
  technological progress.  In the nineteenth century, Yankee mechanical ingenuity,
- "building largely upon the basic discoveries of European scientists, could \n"
- |
  greatly advance the technical arts.  Now the situation is different.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  A nation which depends upon others for its new basic scientific knowledge
- |
  will be slow in its industrial progress and weak in its competitive position
- |
  in world trade, regardless of its mechanical skill.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Publicly and privately supported colleges and universities and
- |
  the endowed research institutes must furnish both the new scientific
- |
  knowledge and the trained research workers. These institutions are uniquely
- |
  qualified by tradition and by their special characteristics to carry
- |
  on basic research. They are charged with the responsibility of conserving
- |
  the knowledge accumulated by the past, imparting that knowledge to
- |
  students, and contributing new knowledge of all kinds. It is chiefly in
- |
  these institutions that scientists may work in an atmosphere which is
- |
  relatively free from the adverse pressure of convention, prejudice,
- |
  or commercial necessity. At their best they provide the scientific
- |
  worker with a strong sense of solidarity and security, as well as a
- |
  substantial degree of personal intellectual freedom. All of these
- |
  factors are of great importance in the development of new knowledge,
- |
  since much of new knowledge is certain to arouse opposition because
- |
  of its tendency to challenge current beliefs or practice.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Industry is generally inhibited by preconceived goals, by its own clearly
- |
  defined standards, and by the constant pressure of commercial necessity.
- |
  Satisfactory progress in basic science seldom occurs under conditions
- |
  prevailing in the normal industrial laboratory. There are some notable
- |
  exceptions, it is true, but even in such cases it is rarely possible
- |
  to match the universities in respect to the freedom which is so important
- |
  to scientific discovery.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  To serve effectively as the centers of basic research these institutions
- |
  must be strong and healthy. They must attract our best scientists as
- |
  teachers and investigators. They must offer research opportunities and
- |
  sufficient compensation to enable them to compete with industry and
- |
  government for the cream of scientific talent.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  During the past 25 years there has been a great increase in industrial
- |
  research involving the application of scientific knowledge to a
- |
  multitude of practical purposes - thus providing new products, new
- |
  industries, new investment opportunities, and millions of jobs.
- |
  During the same period research within Government - again largely
- |
  applied research - has also been greatly expanded. In the decade
- |
  from 1930 to 1940 expenditures for industrial research increased from
- |
  $116,000,000 to $240,000,000 and those for scientific research in
- |
  Government rose from $24,000,000 to $69,000,000. During the same
- |
  period expenditures for scientific research in the colleges and
- |
  universities increased from $20,000,000 to $31,000,000, while those
- |
  in the endowed research institutes declined from $5,200,000 to
- |
  $4,500,000. These are the best estimates available. The figures
- |
  have been taken from a variety of sources and arbitrary definitions
- |
  have necessarily been applied, but it is believed that they may be
- |
  accepted as indicating the following trends:
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  If the colleges, universities, and research institutes are to meet the rapidly
- |
  increasing demands of industry and Government for new scientific knowledge,
- |
  their basic research should be strengthened by use of public funds.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Although there are some notable exceptions, most research
- |
  conducted within governmental laboratories is of an applied nature.
- |
  This has always been true and is likely to remain so. Hence
- |
  Government, like industry, is dependent on the colleges, universities,
- |
  and research institutes to expand the basic scientific frontiers and
- |
  to furnish trained scientific investigators.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Research within the Government represents an important part of our
- |
  total research activity and needs to be strengthened and expanded
- |
  after the war. Such expansion should be directed to fields of inquiry and
- |
  service which are of public importance and are not adequately carried
- |
  on by private organizations.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The most important single factor in scientific and technical work is
- |
  the quality of the personnel employed. The procedures currently
- |
  followed within the Government for recruiting, classifying and compensating
- |
  such personnel place the Government under a severe handicap in competing
- |
  with industry and the universities for first-class scientific talent. Steps
- |
  should be taken to reduce that handicap.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  In the Government the arrangement whereby the numerous scientific
- |
  agencies form parts of larger departments has both advantages
- |
  and disadvantages. but the present pattern is firmly established and
- |
  there is much to be said for it. There is, however, a very real need for
- |
  some measure of coordination of the common scientific activities of
- |
  these agencies, both as to policies and budgets, and at present no such
- |
  means exist.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  A permanent Science Advisory Board should be created to consult with
- |
  these scientific bureaus and to advise the executive and legislative
- |
  branches of Government as to the policies and budgets of Government
- |
  agencies engaged in scientific research.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  This board should be composed of disinterested scientists who have no
- |
  connection with the affairs of any Government agency.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The simplest and most effective way in which the Government can
- |
  strengthen industrial research is to support basic research and to
- |
  develop scientific talent.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The benefits of basic research do not reach all industries equally or at
- |
  the same speed. Some small enterprises never receive any of the
- |
  benefits. It has been suggested that the benefits might be better utilized
- |
  if "research clinics" for such enterprises were to be established. Businessmen
- |
  would thus be able to make more use of research than they now do. This
- |
  proposal is certainly worthy of further study.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  One of the most important factors affecting the amount of industrial
- |
  research is the income-tax law. Government action in respect to this
- |
  subject will affect the rate of technical progress in industry.
- |
  Uncertainties as to the attitude of the Bureau of Internal Revenue
- |
  regarding the deduction of research and development expenses are
- |
  a deterrent to research expenditure. These uncertainties arise from
- |
  lack of clarity of the tax law as to the proper treatment of such costs.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The Internal Revenue Code should be amended to remove present
- |
  uncertainties in regard to the deductibility of research and development
- |
  expenditures as current charges against net income.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Research is also affected by the patent laws. They stimulate new invention
- |
  and they make it possible for new industries to be built around new
- |
  devices or new processes. These industries generate new jobs and new
- |
  products, all of which contribute to the welfare and the strength of the
- |
  country.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Yet, uncertainties in the operation of the patent laws have
- |
  impaired the ability of small industries to translate new ideas into
- |
  processes and products of value to the nation. These uncertainties
- |
  are, in part, attributable to the difficulties and expense incident
- |
  to the operation of the patent system as it presently exists. These
- |
  uncertainties are also attributable to the existence of certain
- |
  abuses, which have appeared in the use of patents. The abuses should
- |
  be corrected. They have led to extravagantly critical attacks which tend
- |
  to discredit a basically sound system.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It is important that the patent system continue to serve the country
- |
  in the manner intended by the Constitution, for it has been a vital
- |
  element in the industrial vigor which has distinguished this nation.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The National Patent Planning Commission has reported on this subject.
- |
  In addition, a detailed study, with recommendations concerning
- |
  the extent to which modifications should be made in our patent laws
- |
  is currently being made under the leadership of the Secretary of Commerce.
- |
  It is recommended, therefore, that specific action with regard to the
- |
  patent laws be withheld pending the submission of the report devoted
- |
  exclusively to that subject.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  International exchange of scientific information is of growing importance.
- |
  Increasing specialization of science will make it more important
- |
  than ever that scientists in this country keep continually ahead of
- |
  developments abroad. In addition a flow of scientific information constitutes
- |
  one facet of general international accord which should be cultivated.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The Government can accomplish significant results in several ways: by aiding
- |
  in the arrangement of international science congresses, in the
- |
  official accrediting of American scientists to such gatherings, in the
- |
  official reception of foreign scientists of standing in this country,
- |
  in making possible a rapid flow of technical information, including
- |
  translation service, and possibly in the provision of international
- |
  fellowships. Private foundations and other groups partially fulfill some of
- |
  these functions at present, but their scope is incomplete and inadequate.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The Government should take an active role in promoting the international
- |
  flow of scientific information.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  We can no longer count on ravaged Europe as a source of fundamental knowledge.
- "In the past we have devoted much of our best efforts to the application of \n"
- |
  such knowledge which has been discovered abroad.  In the future we must pay
- |
  increased attention to discovering this knowledge for ourselves particularly
- |
  since the scientific applications of the future will be more than ever dependent
- |
  upon such basic knowledge.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  New impetus must be given to research in our country.   Such impetus can come
- |
  promptly only from the Government.  Expenditures for research in the colleges,
- |
  universities, and research institutes will otherwise not be able to meet the
- |
  additional demands of increased public need for research.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Further, we cannot expect industry adequately to fill the gap.  Industry will
- |
  fully rise to the challenge of applying new knowledge to new products.  The
- "commercial incentive can be relied upon for that.  But basic research is \n"
- |
  essentially noncommercial in nature.  It will not receive the attention it
- |
  requires if left to industry.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  For many years the Government has wisely supported research in the agricultural
- |
  colleges and the benefits have been great.  The time has come when such support
- "should be extended to other fields.  \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  In providing government support, however, we must endeavor to preserve as far
- "as possible the private support of research both in industry and in the \n"
- |
  colleges, universities, and research institutes.  These private sources should
- |
  continue to carry their share of the financial burden.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It is estimated that an adequate program for Federal support of basic research
- |
  in the colleges, universities, and research institutes and for financing
- |
  important applied research in the public interest, will cost about 10 million
- |
  dollars at the outset and may rise to about 50 million dollars annually when
- |
  fully underway at the end of perhaps 5 years.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- "The responsibility for the creation of new scientific knowledge rests on \n"
- |
  that small body of men and women who understand the fundamental laws of
- |
  nature and are skilled in the techniques of scientific research.  While there
- |
  will always be the rare individual who will rise to the top without benefit
- "of formal education and training, he is the exception and even he might make \n"
- |
  a more notable contribution if he had the benefit of the best education we
- |
  have to offer.  I cannot improve on President Conant's statement that:
- |2+

- |2+

- |2
   "* * * in every section of the entire area where the word science may properly
- |
  be applied, the limiting factor is a human one.  We shall have rapid or slow
- "advance in this direction or in that depending on the number of really \n"
- |
  first-class men who are engaged in the work in question.  * * * So in the last
- |
  analysis, the future of science in this country will be determined by our basic
- |
  educational policy."
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It would be folly to set up a program under which research in the natural
- "sciences and medicine was expanded at the cost of the social sciences, \n"
- |
  humanities, and other studies so essential to national well-being.  This point
- |
  has been well stated by the Moe Committee as follows:
- |2+

- |2+

- "\" As citizens, as good citizens, we therefore think that we must have in \n"
- |
  mind while examining the question before us - the discovery and development
- |
  of scientific talent - the needs of the whole national welfare.  We could
- |
  not suggest to you a program which would syphon into science and technology
- "a disproportionately large share of the nation's highest abilities, without \n"
- |
  doing harm to the nation, nor, indeed, without crippling science.  * * * Science
- |
  cannot live by and unto itself alone."
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  "The uses to which high ability in youth can be put are various and, to a large
- |
  extent, are determined by social pressures and rewards.  When aided by selective
- |
  devices for picking out scientifically talented youth, it is clear that large
- |
  sums of money for scholarships and fellowships and monetary and other rewards
- |
  in disproportionate amounts might draw into science too large a percentage
- |
  of the nation's high ability, with a result highly detrimental to the nation
- |
  and to science.  Plans for the discovery and development of scientific talent
- |
  must be related to the other needs of society for high ability.  * * * There
- |
  is never enough ability at high levels to satisfy all the needs of the nation;
- "we would not seek to draw into science any more of it than science's \n"
- |
  proportionate share."
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Among the young men and women qualified to take up scientific work, since 1940
- |
  there have been few students over 18, except some in medicine and engineering
- |
  in Army and Navy programs and a few 4-F's, who have followed an integrated
- |
  scientific course of studies.  Neither our allies nor, so far as we know, our
- |
  enemies have done anything so radical as thus to suspend almost completely
- |
  their educational activities in scientific pursuits during the war period.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Two great principles have guided us in this country as we have turned our full
- |
  efforts to war.  First, the sound democratic principle that there should be no
- "favored classes or special privilege in a time of peril, that all should be \n"
- |
  ready to sacrifice equally; second,  the tenet that every man should serve in
- |
  the capacity in which his talents and experience can best be applied for the
- |
  prosecution of the war effort.  In general we have held these principles well
- |
  in balance.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  In my opinion, however, we have drawn too heavily for nonscientific purposes
- |
  upon the great natural resource which resides in our trained young scientists
- |
  and engineers.  For the general good of the country too many such men have gone
- |
  into uniform, and their talents have not always been fully utilized.  With the
- |
  exception of those men engaged in war research, all physically fit students
- "at graduate level have been taken into the armed forces.  Those ready for \n"
- |
  college training in the sciences have not been permitted to enter upon that
- |
  training.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  There is thus an accumulating deficit of trained research personnel which will
- |
  continue for many years.  The deficit of science and technology students who,
- |
  but for the war, would have received bachelor's degrees is about 150,000.  The
- |
  deficit of those holding advanced degrees - that is, young scholars trained to
- "the point where they are capable of carrying on original work - has been \n"
- |
  estimated as amounting to about 17,000 by 1955 in chemistry, engineering,
- |
  geology, mathematics, physics, psychology, and the biological sciences.
- |2+

- |2+

- "With mounting demands for scientists both for teaching and for research, we \n"
- |
  will enter the post-war period with a serious deficit in our trained scientific
- |
  personnel.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- "Confronted with these deficits, we are compelled to look to the use of our \n"
- "basic human resources and formulate a program which will assure their \n"
- |
  conservation and effective development.  The committee advising me on scientific
- |
  personnel has stated the following principle which should guide our planning:
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  "If we were all-knowing and all-wise we might, but we think probably not, write
- |
  you a plan whereby there might be selected for training, which they otherwise
- |
  would not get, those who, 20 years hence, would be scientific leaders, and we
- |
  might not bother about any lesser manifestations of scientific ability.  But in
- "the present state of knowledge a plan cannot be made which will select, and \n"
- |
  assist, only those young men and women who will give the top future leadership
- |
  to science.  To get top leadership there must be a relatively large base of
- |
  high ability selected for development and then successive skimmings of the cream
- |
  of ability at successive times and at higher levels.  No one can select from
- |
  the bottom those who will be the leaders at the top because unmeasured and
- |
  unknown factors enter into scientific, or any, leadership.  There are brains
- |
  and character, strength and health, happiness and spiritual vitality, interest
- |
  and motivation, and no one knows what else, that must needs enter into this
- |
  supra-mathematical calculus.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  "We think we probably would not, even if we were all-wise and all-knowing, write
- |
  you a plan whereby you would be assured of scientific leadership at one stroke.
- |
  We think as we think because we are not interested in setting up an elect.
- |
  We think it much the best plan, in this constitutional Republic,
- |
  that opportunity be held out to all kinds and conditions of men whereby they
- |
  can better themselves.  This is the American way; this is the way the United
- |
  States has become what it is.  We think it very important that circumstances
- |
  be such that there be no ceilings, other than ability itself, to intellectual
- |
  ambition.  We think it very important that every boy and girl shall know that,
- |
  if he shows that he has what it takes, the sky is the limit.  Even if it be
- |
  shown subsequently that he has not what it takes to go to the top, he will go
- |
  further than he would otherwise go if there had been a ceiling beyond which
- |
  he always knew he could not aspire.
- |2+

- |2+

- "\"By proceeding from point to point and taking stock on the way, by giving \n"
- |
  further opportunity to those who show themselves worthy of further opportunity,
- "by giving the most opportunity to those who show themselves continually \n"
- |
  developing - this is the way we propose.  This is the American way:  a man work
- |
  for what he gets."
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- "Higher education in this country is largely for those who have the means.  If \n"
- "those who have the means coincided entirely with those persons who have the \n"
- |
  talent we should not be squandering a part of our higher education on those
- |
  undeserving of it, nor neglecting great talent among those who fail to attend
- "college for economic reasons.  There are talented individuals in every \n"
- |
  segment of the population, but with few exceptions those without the means
- |
  of buying higher education go without it.  Here is a tremendous waste of the
- |
  greatest resource of a nation - the intelligence of its citizens.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  If ability, and not the circumstance of family fortune, is made to determine
- |
  who shall receive higher education in science, then we shall be assured of
- |
  constantly improving quality at every level of scientific activity.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- "We have a serious deficit in scientific personnel partly because the men \n"
- "who would have studied science in the colleges and universities have been \n"
- |
  serving in the Armed Forces.  Many had begun their studies before they went
- "to war.  Others with capacity for scientific education went to war after \n"
- |
  finishing high school.  The most immediate prospect of making up some of the
- "deficit in scientific personnel is by salvaging scientific talent from the \n"
- "generation in uniform.  For even if we should start now to train the current \n"
- "crop of high school graduates, it would be 1951 before they would complete \n"
- "graduate studies and be prepared for effective scientific research.  This \n"
- |
  fact underlines the necessity of salvaging potential scientists in uniform.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The Armed Services should comb their records for men who, prior to or during
- "the war, have given evidence of talent for science, and make prompt \n"
- |
  arrangements, consistent with current discharge plans, for ordering those who
- |
  remain in uniform as soon as militarily possible to duty at institutions
- "here and overseas where they can continue their scientific education.  \n"
- |
  Moreover, they should see that those who study overseas have the benefit of
- |
  the latest scientific developments.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The country may be proud of the fact that 95 percent of boys and girls of
- |
  the fifth grade age are enrolled in school, but the drop in enrollment after
- |
  the fifth grade is less satisfying.  For every 1,000 students in the fifth
- |
  grade, 600 are lost to education before the end of high school, and all but
- |
  72 have ceased formal education before completion of college.  While we are
- |
  concerned primarily with methods of selecting and educating high school
- |
  graduates at the college and higher levels, we cannot be complacent about the
- |
  loss of potential talent which is inherent in the present situation.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Students drop out of school, college, and graduate school, or do not get that
- "far, for a variety of reasons:  they cannot afford to go on; schools and \n"
- |
  colleges providing courses equal to their capacity are not available locally;
- |
  business and industry recruit many of the most promising before they have
- |
  finished the training of which they are capable.  These reasons apply with
- |
  particular force to science:  the road is long and expensive; it extends at
- |
  least 6 years beyond high school; the percentage of science students who can
- |
  obtain first-rate training in institutions near home is small.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Improvement in the teaching of science is imperative; for students of latent
- |
  scientific ability are particularly vulnerable to high school teaching which
- |
  fails to awaken interest or to provide adequate instruction.  To enlarge the
- "group of specially qualified men and women it is necessary to increase the \n"
- |
  number who go to college.  This involves improved high school instruction,
- "provision for helping individual talented students to finish high school \n"
- |
  (primarily the responsibility of the local communities), and opportunities for
- |
  more capable, promising high school students to go to college.  Anything
- |
  short of this means serious waste of higher education and neglect of human
- |
  resources.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  To encourage and enable a larger number of young men and women of ability to
- |
  take up science as a career, and in order gradually to reduce the deficit of
- |
  trained scientific personnel, it is recommended that provision be made for a
- |
  reasonable number of (a) undergraduate scholarships and graduate fellowships
- |
  and (b) fellowships for advanced training and fundamental research.  The
- |
  details should be worked out with reference to the interests of the several
- |
  States and of the universities and colleges; and care should be taken not to
- |
  impair the freedom of the institutions and individuals concerned.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The program proposed by the Moe Committee in Appendix 4 would provide 24,000
- |
  undergraduate scholarships and 900 graduate fellowships and would cost about
- |
  $30,000,000 annually when in full operation.  Each year under this program
- "6,000 undergraduate scholarships would be made available to high school \n"
- |
  graduates, and 300 graduate fellowships would be offered to college graduates.
- |
  Approximately the scale of allowances provided for under the educational
- |
  program for returning veterans has been used in estimating the cost of this
- |
  program.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The plan is, further, that all those who receive such scholarships or
- |
  fellowships in science should be enrolled in a National Science Reserve and
- "be liable to call into the service of the Government, in connection with \n"
- |
  scientific or technical work in time of war or other national emergency
- |
  declared by Congress or proclaimed by the President. Thus, in addition to
- |
  the general benefits to the nation by reason of the addition to its trained
- |
  ranks of such a corps of scientific workers, there would be a definite benefit
- "to the nation in having these scientific workers on call in national \n"
- "emergencies.  The Government would be well advised to invest the money \n"
- |
  involved in this plan even if the benefits to the nation were thought of
- |
  solely - which they are not - in terms of national preparedness.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  We have been living on our fat. For more than 5 years many of our
- |
  scientists have been fighting the war in the laboratories, in
- |
  the factories and shops, and at the front. We have been directing
- |
  the energies of our scientists to the development of weapons and materials
- |
  and methods, on a large number of relatively narrow projects initiated and
- |
  controlled by the Office of Scientific Research and Development and other
- |
  Government agencies. Like troops, the scientists have been mobilized,
- |
  and thrown into action to serve their country in time of emergency.
- |
  But they have been diverted to a greater extent than is generally
- |
  appreciated from the search for answers to the fundamental problems -
- |
  from the search on which human welfare and progress depends. This
- |
  is not a complaint - it is a fact. The mobilization of science
- |
  behind the lines is aiding the fighting men at the front to
- |
  win the war and to shorten it; and it has resulted incidentally
- |
  in the accumulation of a vast amount of experience and knowledge of
- |
  the application of science to particular problems, much of which
- |
  can be put to use when the war is over. Fortunately, this country
- |
  had the scientists - and the time - to make this contribution and thus
- |
  to advance the date of victory.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Much of the information and experience acquired during the war is confined
- |
  to the agencies that gathered it. Except to the extent that military security
- |
  dictates otherwise, such knowledge should be spread upon the record for
- |
  the benefit of the general public.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Thanks to the wise provision of the Secretary of War and the Secretary
- |
  of the Navy, most of the results of war-time medical research have
- |
  been published. Several hundred articles have appeared in the professional
- |
  journals; many are in process of publication. The material still subject
- |
  to security classification should be released as soon as possible.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It is my view that most of the remainder of the classified scientific material
- |
  should be released as soon as there is ground for belief that the
- |
  enemy will not be able to turn it against us in this war. Most of the
- |
  information needed by industry and in education can be released without
- |
  disclosing its embodiments in actual military material and devices.
- |
  Basically there is no reason to believe that scientists of other countries
- |
  will not in time rediscover everything we now know which is held in
- |
  secrecy. A broad dissemination of scientific information upon which further
- |
  advances can readily be made furnishes a sounder foundation for our national
- |
  security than a policy of restriction which would impede our own progress
- |
  although imposed in the hope that possible enemies would not catch up with us.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  During the war it has been necessary for selected groups of scientists
- |
  to work on specialized problems, with relatively little information as
- |
  to what other groups were doing and had done. Working against time,
- |
  the Office of Scientific Research and Development has been
- |
  obliged to enforce this practice during the war, although it was
- |
  realized by all concerned that it was an emergency measure which
- |
  prevented the continuous cross-fertilization so essential to fruitful
- |
  scientific effort.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Our ability to overcome possible future enemies depends upon scientific
- |
  advances which will proceed more rapidly with diffusion of knowledge
- |
  than under a policy of continued restriction of knowledge now
- |
  in our possession.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  In planning the release of scientific data and experience collected
- |
  in connection with the war, we must not overlook the fact that
- |
  research has gone forward under many auspices - the Army, the Navy,
- |
  the Office of Scientific Research and Development, the National
- |
  Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, other departments and agencies
- |
  of the Government, educational institutions, and many industrial
- |
  organizations. There have been numerous cases of independent
- |
  discovery of the same truth in different places. To permit the release
- |
  of information by one agency and to continue to restrict it elsewhere
- |
  would be unfair in its effect and would tend to impair the morale and
- |
  efficiency of scientists who have submerged individual interests
- |
  in the controls and restrictions of war.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  A part of the information now classified which should be released
- |
  is possessed jointly by our allies and ourselves. Plans for release
- |
  of such information should be coordinated with our allies to minimize
- |
  danger of international friction which would result from sporadic
- |
  uncontrolled release.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The agency responsible for recommending the release of information from
- |
  military classification should be an Army, Navy, civilian body,
- |
  well grounded in science and technology. It should be competent
- |
  to advise the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy. It
- |
  should, moreover, have sufficient recognition to secure prompt and
- |
  practical decisions.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  To satisfy these considerations I recommend the establishment of
- |
  a Board, made up equally of scientists and military men, whose
- |
  function would be to pass upon the declassification and to control
- |
  the release for publication of scientific information which is now classified.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The release of information from security regulations is but
- |
  one phase of the problem. The other is to provide for
- |
  preparation of the material and its publication in a form and at a price which
- |
  will facilitate dissemination and use. In the case of the Office
- |
  of Scientific Research and Development, arrangements have been
- |
  made for the preparation of manuscripts, while the staffs under our control
- |
  are still assembled and in possession of the records, as soon as the
- |
  pressure for production of results for this war has begun to relax.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  We should get this scientific material to scientists everywhere with great
- |
  promptness, and at as low a price as is consistent with suitable
- |
  format. We should also get it to the men studying overseas so that
- |
  they will know what has happened in their absence.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It is recommended that measures which will encourage and facilitate
- |
  the preparation and publication of reports be adopted forthwith
- |
  by all agencies, governmental and private, possessing scientific
- |
  information released from security control.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  One lesson is clear from the reports of the several committees
- |
  attached as appendices. The Federal Government should accept new
- |
  responsibilities for promoting the creation of new scientific
- |
  knowledge and the development of scientific talent in our youth.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The extent and nature of these new responsibilities are set
- |
  forth in detail in the reports of the committees whose recommendations
- |
  in this regard are fully endorsed.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  In discharging these responsibilities Federal funds should be made
- |
  available. We have given much thought to the question of how plans for
- |
  the use of Federal funds may be arranged so that such funds will not drive
- |
  out of the picture funds from local governments, foundations, and
- |
  private donors. We believe that our proposals will minimize that
- |
  effect, but we do not think that it can be completely avoided. We
- |
  submit, however, that the nation's need for more and better scientific
- |
  research is such that the risk must be accepted.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It is also clear that the effective discharge of these responsibilities
- |
  will require the full attention of some over-all agency devoted
- |
  to that purpose. There should be a focal point within the Government
- |
  for a concerted program of assisting scientific research conducted
- |
  outside of Government. Such an agency should furnish the funds needed
- |
  to support basic research in the colleges and universities, should
- |
  coordinate where possible research programs on matters of utmost
- |
  importance to the national welfare, should formulate a national policy
- |
  for the Government toward science, should sponsor the interchange of
- |
  scientific information among scientists and laboratories both in
- |
  this country and abroad, and should ensure that the incentives to
- |
  research in industry and the universities are maintained. All of the
- |
  committees advising on these matters agree on the necessity for
- |
  such an agency.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  There are within Government departments many groups whose interests are
- |
  primarily those of scientific research. Notable examples are found
- |
  within the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Interior, and the
- |
  Federal Security Agency. These groups are concerned with science as
- |
  collateral and peripheral to the major problems of those Departments.
- |
  These groups should remain where they are, and continue to perform
- |
  their present functions, including the support of agricultural
- |
  research by grants to the Land Grant Colleges and Experiment Stations,
- |
  since their largest contribution lies in applying fundamental
- |
  knowledge to the special problems of the Departments within which
- |
  they are established.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  By the same token these groups cannot be made the repository of
- |
  the new and large responsibilities in science which belong to the
- |
  Government and which the Government should accept. The recommendations
- |
  in this report which relate to research within the Government, to the
- |
  release of scientific information, to clarification of the tax laws,
- |
  and to the recovery and development of our scientific talent now
- |
  in uniform can be implemented by action within the existing
- |
  structure of the Government. But nowhere in the Governmental structure
- |
  receiving its funds from Congress is there an agency adapted to
- |
  supplementing the support of basic research in the universities,
- |
  both in medicine and the natural sciences; adapted to supporting
- |
  research on new weapons for both Services; or adapted to
- |
  administering a program of science scholarships and fellowships.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  A new agency should be established, therefore, by the Congress
- |
  for the purpose. Such an agency, moreover, should be an independent
- |
  agency devoted to the support of scientific research and advanced
- |
  scientific education alone. Industry learned many years ago that basic
- |
  research cannot often be fruitfully conducted as an adjunct
- |
  to or a subdivision of an operating agency or department. Operating
- |
  agencies have immediate operating goals and are under constant
- |
  pressure to produce in a tangible way, for that is the test of their
- |
  value. None of these conditions is favorable to basic research.
- |
  research is the exploration of the unknown and is necessarily
- |
  speculative. It is inhibited by conventional approaches, traditions,
- |
  and standards. It cannot be satisfactorily conducted in an
- |
  atmosphere where it is gauged and tested by operating or production
- |
  standards. Basic scientific research should not, therefore, be
- |
  placed under an operating agency whose paramount concern is anything
- |
  other than research. Research will always suffer when put in
- |
  competition with operations. The decision that there should be a
- |
  new and independent agency was reached by each of the committees
- |
  advising in these matters.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  I am convinced that these new functions should be centered in one agency.
- |
  Science is fundamentally a unitary thing. The number of independent
- |
  agencies should be kept to a minimum. Much medical progress,
- |
  for example, will come from fundamental advances in chemistry.
- |
  Separation of the sciences in tight compartments, as would occur
- |
  if more than one agency were involved, would retard and not
- |
  advance scientific knowledge as a whole.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  There are certain basic principles which must underlie the program
- |
  of Government support for scientific research and education if
- |
  such support is to be effective and if it is to avoid impairing
- |
  the very things we seek to foster. These principles are as
- |
  follows:
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  (1) Whatever the extent of support may be, there must be stability of
- |
  funds over a period of years so that long-range programs may be undertaken.
- |
  (2) The agency to administer such funds should be composed of citizens
- |
  selected only on the basis of their interest in and capacity to
- |
  promote the work of the agency. They should be persons of broad interest
- |
  in and understanding of the peculiarities of scientific research and
- |
  education.
- |
  (3) The agency should promote research through contracts or grants
- |
  to organizations outside the Federal Government. It should not operate
- |
  any laboratories of its own.
- |
  (4) Support of basic research in the public and private colleges,
- |
  universities, and research institutes must leave the internal
- |
  control of policy, personnel, and the method and scope of the research
- |
  to the institutions themselves. This is of the utmost importance.
- |
  (5) While assuring complete independence and freedom for the nature,
- |
  scope, and methodology of research carried on in the institutions
- |
  receiving public funds, and while retaining discretion in the allocation
- |
  of funds among such institutions, the Foundation proposed herein
- |
  must be responsible to the President and the Congress. Only through such
- |
  responsibility can we maintain the proper relationship between
- |
  science and other aspects of a democratic system. The usual controls
- |
  of audits, reports, budgeting, and the like, should, of course, apply
- |
  to the administrative and fiscal operations of the Foundation, subject,
- |
  however, to such adjustments in procedure as are necessary to meet
- |
  the special requirements of research.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Basic research is a long-term process - it ceases to be basic if immediate
- |
  results are expected on short-term support. Methods should therefore
- |
  be found which will permit the agency to make commitments of funds
- |
  from current appropriations for programs of five years duration or
- |
  longer. Continuity and stability of the program and its support may
- |
  be expected (a) from the growing realization by the Congress of
- |
  the benefits to the public from scientific research, and (b) from
- |
  the conviction which will grow among those who conduct research under the
- |
  auspices of the agency that good quality work will be followed by
- |
  continuing support.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  As stated earlier in this report, military preparedness requires a
- |
  permanent, independent, civilian-controlled organization, having close
- |
  liaison with the Army and Navy, but with funds direct from Congress
- |
  and the clear power to initiate military research which will
- |
  supplement and strengthen that carried on directly under the control
- |
  of the Army and Navy. As a temporary measure the National Academy
- |
  of Sciences has established the Research Board for National Security
- |
  at the request of the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy.
- |
  This is highly desirable in order that there may be no interruption
- |
  in the relations between scientists and military men after the emergency
- |
  wartime Office of Scientific Research and Development goes out
- |
  of existence. The Congress is now considering legislation to provide
- |
  funds for this Board by direct appropriation.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  I believe that, as a permanent measure, it would be appropriate to
- |
  add to the agency needed to perform the other functions recommended
- |
  in this report the responsibilities for civilian-initiated and
- |
  civilian-controlled military research. The function of such a
- |
  civilian group would be primarily to conduct long-range scientific
- |
  research on military problems - leaving to the Services research
- |
  on the improvement of existing weapons.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Some research on military problems should be conducted, in time of
- |
  peace as well as in war, by civilians independently of the
- |
  military establishment. It is the primary responsibility of the
- |
  Army and Navy to train the men, make available the weapons, and
- |
  employ the strategy that will bring victory in combat. The Armed
- |
  Services cannot be expected to be experts in all of the complicated
- |
  fields which make it possible for a great nation to fight successfully
- |
  in total war. There are certain kinds of research - such as
- |
  research on the improvement of existing weapons - which can
- |
  best be done within the military establishment. However, the job
- |
  of long-range research involving application of the newest
- |
  scientific discoveries to military needs should be the responsibility
- |
  of those civilian scientists in the universities and in industry
- |
  who are best trained to discharge it thoroughly and successfully. It is
- |
  essential that both kinds of research go forward and that
- |
  there be the closest liaison between the two groups.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Placing the civilian military research function in the proposed agency
- |
  would bring it into close relationship with a broad program
- |
  of basic research in both the natural sciences and medicine. A
- |
  balance between military and other research could thus readily
- |
  be maintained.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The establishment of the new agency, including a civilian military
- |
  research group, should not be delayed by the existence of
- |
  the Research Board for National Security, which is a temporary
- |
  measure. Nor should the creation of the new agency be delayed
- |
  by uncertainties in regard to the postwar organization of our
- |
  military departments themselves. Clearly, the new agency, including
- |
  a civilian military research group within it, can remain sufficiently
- |
  flexible to adapt its operations to whatever may be the final
- |
  organization of the military departments.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It is my judgment that the national interest in scientific research
- |
  and scientific education can best be promoted by the creation of a
- |
  National Research Foundation.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  I. Purposes. - The National Research Foundation should develop
- |
  and promote a national policy for scientific research and
- |
  scientific education, should support basic research in nonprofit
- |
  organizations, should develop scientific talent in American youth by
- |
  means of scholarships and fellowships, and should by contract
- |
  and otherwise support long-range research on military matters.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  II. Members. - 1. Responsibility to the people, through the President
- |
  and Congress, should be placed in the hands of, say nine
- |
  Members, who should be persons not otherwise connected with the
- |
  Government and not representative of any special interest, who
- |
  should be known as National Research Foundation Members, selected
- |
  by the President on the basis of their interest in and capacity
- |
  to promote the purposes of the Foundation.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  2. The terms of the Members should be, say, 4 years, and no
- |
  Member should be eligible for immediate reappointment provided
- |
  he has served a full 4-year term. It should be arranged that
- |
  the Members first appointed serve terms of such length that at least
- |
  two Members are appointed each succeeding year.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  3. The Members should serve without compensation but should be
- |
  entitled to their expenses incurred in the performance of their
- |
  duties.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  4. The Members should elect their own chairman annually.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  5. The chief executive officer of the Foundation should be a
- |
  director appointed by the Members. Subject to the direction and
- |
  supervision of the Foundation Members (acting as a board), the
- |
  director should discharge all the fiscal, legal, and administrative
- |
  functions of the Foundation. The director should receive a
- |
  salary that is fully adequate to attract an outstanding man to the post.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  6. There should be an administrative office responsible to the
- |
  director to handle in one place the fiscal, legal, personnel, and
- |
  other similar administrative functions necessary to the accomplishment
- |
  of the purposes of the Foundation.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  7. With the exception of the director, the division members, and
- |
  one executive officer appointed by the director to administer
- |
  the affairs of each division, all employees of the Foundation should
- |
  be appointed under Civil Service regulations.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  III. Organization. - 1. In order to accomplish the purposes of the Foundation
- |
  the Members should establish several professional Divisions to
- |
  be responsible to the Members. At the outset these Divisions should be:
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  a. Division of Medical Research. - The function of this Division should
- |
  be to support medical research.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  b. Division of Natural Sciences. - The function of this Division should
- |
  be to support research in the physical and natural sciences.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  c. Division of National Defense. - It should be the function of this
- |
  Division to support long-range scientific research on military matters.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  d. Division of Scientific Personnel and Education. - It should be the function
- |
  of this Division to support and to supervise the grant of scholarships and
- |
  fellowships in science.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  e. Division of Publications and Scientific Collaboration. - This Division
- |
  should be charged with encouraging the publication of scientific knowledge
- |
  and promoting international exchange of scientific information.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  2. Each Division of the Foundation should be made up of at least
- |
  five members, appointed by the Members of the Foundation. In making such
- |
  appointments the Members should request and consider recommendations from
- |
  the National Academy of Sciences which should be asked to establish a
- |
  new National Research Foundation nominating committee in order to bring together
- |
  the recommendations of scientists in all organizations. The chairman of each
- |
  Division should be appointed by the Members of the Foundation.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  3. The division Members should be appointed for such terms as the Members
- |
  of the Foundation may determine, and may be reappointed at the discretion
- |
  of the Members. They should receive their expenses and compensation for their
- |
  services at a per diem rate of, say, $50 while engaged on business of
- |
  the Foundation, but no division member should receive more than, say,
- |
  $10,000 compensation per year.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  4. Membership of the Division of National Defense should include, in
- |
  addition to, say, five civilian members, one representative designated
- |
  by the Secretary of War, and one representative of the Secretary of the
- |
  Navy, who should serve without additional compensation for this duty.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  IV. Functions. - 1. The Members of the Foundation should have the following
- |
  functions, powers, and duties:
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  a. To formulate over-all policies of the Foundation.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  b. To establish and maintain such offices within the United States,
- |
  its territories and possessions, as they may deem necessary.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  c. To meet and function at any place within the United States, its
- |
  territories and possessions.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  d. To obtain and utilize the services of other Government agencies
- |
  to the extent that such agencies are prepared to render such services.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  e. To adopt, promulgate, amend, and rescind rules and regulations
- |
  to carry out the provisions of the legislation and the policies
- |
  and practices of the Foundation.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  f. To review and balance the financial requirements of the several Divisions
- |
  and to propose to the President the annual estimate for the
- |
  funds required by each Division. Appropriations should be earmarked
- |
  for the purposes of specific Divisions, but the Foundation should
- |
  be left discretion with respect to the expenditure of each Division's
- |
  funds.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  g. To make contracts or grants for the conduct of research by negotiation
- |
  without advertising for bids.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  And with the advice of the National Research Foundation Divisions
- |
  concerned -
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  h. To create such advisory and cooperating agencies and councils,
- |
  state, regional, or national, as in their judgment will aid in
- |
  effectuating the purposes of the legislation, and to pay the
- |
  expenses thereof.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  i. To enter into contracts with or make grants to educational and
- |
  nonprofit research institutions for support of scientific research.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  j. To initiate and finance in appropriate agencies, institutions,
- |
  or organizations, research on problems related to the national defense.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  k. To initiate and finance in appropriate organizations research projects
- |
  for which existing facilities are unavailable or inadequate.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  l. To establish scholarships and fellowships in the natural sciences
- |
  including biology and medicine.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  m. To promote the dissemination of scientific and technical information
- |
  and to further its international exchange.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  n. To support international cooperation in science by providing financial
- |
  aid for international meetings, associations of scientific societies,
- |
  and scientific research programs organized on an international basis.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  o. To devise and promote the use of methods of improving the transition
- |
  between research and its practical application in industry.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  2. The Divisions should be responsible to the Members of the Foundation
- "for - \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  a. Formulation of programs and policy within the scope of the particular
- |
  Divisions.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  b. Recommendations regarding the allocation of research programs
- |
  among research organizations.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  c. Recommendation of appropriate arrangements between the Foundation
- |
  and the organizations selected to carry on the program.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  d. Recommendation of arrangements with State and local authorities
- |
  in regard to cooperation in a program of science scholarships
- |
  and fellowships.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  e. Periodic review of the quality of research being conducted under
- |
  the auspices of the particular Division and revision of the program
- |
  of support of research.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  f. Presentation of budgets of financial needs for the work of the Division.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  g. Maintaining liaison with other scientific research agencies, both
- |
  governmental and private, concerned with the work of the Division.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  V. Patent Policy. - The success of the National Research Foundation
- |
  in promoting scientific research in this country will depend to a very
- |
  large degree upon the cooperation of organizations outside the
- |
  Government. In making contracts with or grants to such organizations
- |
  the Foundation should protect the public interest adequately and at
- |
  the same time leave the cooperating organization with adequate freedom
- |
  and incentive to conduct scientific research. The public interest will
- |
  normally be adequately protected if the Government receives a royalty-free
- |
  license for governmental purposes under any patents resulting from work
- |
  financed by the Foundation. There should be no obligation on the research
- |
  institution to patent discoveries made as a result of support from the
- |
  Foundation. There should certainly not be any absolute requirement that
- |
  all rights in such discoveries be assigned to the Government, but it should
- |
  be left to the discretion of the director and the interested Division
- |
  whether in special cases the public interest requires such an assignment.
- |
  Legislation on this point should leave to the Members of the
- |
  Foundation discretion as to its patent policy in order that patent arrangements
- |
  may be adjusted as circumstances and the public interest require.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  VI. Special Authority. - In order to insure that men of great competence
- |
  and experience may be designated as Members of the Foundation and as members
- |
  of the several professional Divisions, the legislation creating
- |
  the Foundation should contain specific authorization so that the Members
- |
  of the Foundation and the Members of the Divisions may also engage
- |
  in private and gainful employment, notwithstanding the provisions
- |
  of any other laws: provided, however, that no compensation for such
- |
  employment is received in any form from any profit-making institution
- |
  which receives funds under contract, or otherwise, from the Division or
- |
  Divisions of the Foundation with which the individual is concerned.
- |
  In normal times, in view of the restrictive statutory prohibitions
- |
  against dual interests on the part of Government officials, it would
- |
  be virtually impossible to persuade persons having private employment
- |
  of any kind to serve the Government in an official capacity. In order,
- |
  however, to secure the part-time services of the most competent
- |
  men as Members of the Foundation and the Divisions, these stringent
- |
  prohibitions should be relaxed to the extent indicated.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Since research is unlike the procurement of standardized items, which
- |
  are susceptible to competitive bidding on fixed specifications, the
- |
  legislation creating the National Research Foundation should free the
- |
  Foundation from the obligation to place its contracts for research through
- |
  advertising for bids. This is particularly so since the measure of
- |
  a successful research contract lies not in the dollar cost but in
- |
  the qualitative and quantitative contribution which is made to
- |
  our knowledge. The extent of this contribution in turn depends on
- |
  the creative spirit and talent which can be brought to bear within a
- |
  research laboratory. The National Research Foundation must, therefore, be
- |
  free to place its research contracts or grants not only with those
- |
  institutions which have a demonstrated research capacity but also with
- |
  other institutions whose latent talent or creative atmosphere affords
- |
  promise of research success.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  As in the case of the research sponsored during the war by the Office
- |
  of Scientific Research and Development, the research sponsored by
- |
  the National Research Foundation should be conducted, in general,
- |
  on an actual cost basis without profit to the institution receiving
- |
  the research contract or grant.
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  There is one other matter which requires special mention. Since research does
- |
  not fall within the category of normal commercial or procurement
- |
  operations which are easily covered by the usual contractual relations,
- |
  it is essential that certain statutory and regulatory fiscal
- |
  requirements be waived in the case of research contractors. For example,
- |
  the National Research Foundation should be authorized by legislation
- |
  to make, modify, or amend contracts of all kinds with or without
- |
  legal consideration, and without performance bonds. Similarly, advance
- |
  payments should be allowed in the discretion of the Director
- |
  of the Foundation when required. Finally, the normal vouchering requirements
- |
  of the General Accounting Office with respect to detailed itemization or
- |
  substantiation of vouchers submitted under cost contracts should be
- |
  relaxed for research contractors. Adherence to the usual procedures
- |
  in the case of research contracts will impair the efficiency of research
- |
  operations and will needlessly increase the cost of the work of the
- |
  Government. Without the broad authority along these lines which was
- |
  contained in the First War Powers Act and its implementing Executive
- |
  Orders, together with the special relaxation of vouchering requirements
- |
  granted by the General Accounting Office, the Office of Scientific
- |
  Research and Development would have been gravely handicapped in carrying
- |
  on research on military matters during this war. Colleges and universities
- |
  in which research will be conducted principally under contract with the
- |
  Foundation are, unlike commercial institutions, not equipped to handle
- |
  the detailed vouchering procedures and auditing technicalities which
- |
  are required of the usual Government contractors.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  VII. Budget. - Studies by the several committees provide a partial
- |
  basis for making an estimate of the order of magnitude of
- |
  the funds required to implement the proposed program. Clearly the program
- |
  should grow in a healthy manner from modest beginnings. The following
- |
  very rough estimates are given for the first year of operation after the
- |
  Foundation is organized and operating, and for the fifth year of operation
- |
  when it is expected that the operations would have reached a fairly
- |
  stable level:
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The National Research Foundation herein proposed meets the urgent need
- |
  of the days ahead. The form of the organization suggested is the
- |
  result of considerable deliberation. The form is important. The very
- |
  successful pattern of organization of the National Advisory Committee
- |
  for Aeronautics, which has promoted basic research on problems of flight
- |
  during the past thirty years, has been carefully considered in proposing
- |
  the method of appointment of Members of the Foundation and in defining
- |
  their responsibilities. Moreover, whatever program is established it
- |
  is vitally important that it satisfy the Five Fundamentals.
- |2+

- |
  The Foundation here proposed has been described only in outline. The
- |
  excellent reports of the committees which studied these matters are
- |
  attached as appendices. They will be of aid in furnishing detailed
- |
  suggestions.
- |2+

- |
  Legislation is necessary. It should be drafted with great care. Early
- |
  action is imperative, however, if this nation is to meet the
- |
  challenge of science and fully utilize the potentialities of science. On
- |
  the wisdom with which we bring science to bear against the problems
- of the coming years depends in large measure our future as a nation.

  MR. PRESIDENT:\n\n\n\n  In a letter dated November 17, 1944, President Roosevelt
  requested my \nrecommendations on the following points:\n\n  (1) What can be done,
  consistent with military security, and with the prior\napproval of the military
  authorities, to make known to the world as soon as\npossible the contributions which
  have been made during our war effort to\nscientific knowledge?\n\n  (2) With particular
  reference to the war of science against disease, what\ncan be done now to organize
  a program for continuing in the future the work\nwhich has been done in medicine
  and related sciences?\n\n  (3) What can the Government do now and in the future
  to aid research \nactivities by public and private organizations?\n\n  (4) Can an
  effective program be proposed for discovering and developing\nscientific talent
  in American youth so that the continuing future of scientific\nresearch in this
  country may be assured on a level comparable to what has \nbeen done during the
  war?\n\n  It is clear from President Roosevelt's letter that in speaking of science\nthat
  he had in mind the natural sciences, including biology and medicine,\nand I have
  so interpreted his questions.  Progress in other fields, such \nas the social sciences
  and the humanities, is likewise important; but the\nprogram for science presented
  in my report warrants immediate attention.\n\n  In seeking answers to President
  Roosevelt's questions I have had the \nassistance of distinguished committees specially
  qualified to advise in \nrespect to these subjects.  The committees have given these
  matters the\nserious attention they deserve; indeed, they have regarded this as
  an \nopportunity to participate in shaping the policy of the country with reference\nto
  scientific research.  They have had many meetings and have submitted formal\nreports.
  \ I have been in close touch with the work of the committees and \nwith their members
  throughout.  I have examined all of the data they assembled\nand the suggestions
  they submitted on the points raised in President Roosevelt's\nletter.\n\n  Although
  the report which I submit herewith is my own, the facts, conclusions,\nand recommendations
  are based on the findings of the committees which have\nstudied these questions.
  \ Since my report is necessarily brief, I am including\nas appendices the full reports
  of the committees.\n\n  A single mechanism for implementing the recommendations
  of the several\ncommittees is essential.  In proposing such a mechanism I have departed
  somewhat\nfrom the specific recommendations of the committees, but I have since
  been\nassured that the plan I am proposing is fully acceptable to the committee\nmembers.\n\n
  \ The pioneer spirit is still vigorous within this nation.  Science offers a \nlargely
  unexplored hinterland for the pioneer who has the tools for his task.\nThe rewards
  of such exploration both for the Nation and the individual are\ngreat.  Scientific
  progress is one essential key to our security as a nation,\nto our better health,
  to more jobs, to a higher standard of living, and to\nour cultural progress.\n\n
  \ Respectfully yours,\n\t\t\t\t\t(s) V. Bush, Director\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE
  UNITED STATES,\nThe White House,\nWashington, D. C.\n\n\n___\n  PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S
  LETTER  \n\n\n  THE WHITE HOUSE\n  Washington, D. C.\n  November 17, 1944\n\n\nDEAR
  DR. BUSH:  The Office of Scientific Research and Development, of which\nyou are
  the Director, represents a unique experiment of team-work and \ncooperation in coordinating
  scientific research and in applying existing \nscientific knowledge to the solution
  of the technical problems paramount\nin war.  Its work has been conducted in the
  utmost secrecy and carried on \nwithout public recognition of any kind; but its
  tangible results can be found\nin the communiques coming in from the battlefronts
  all over the world.  Some\nday the full story of its achievements can be told.\n\n
  \ There is, however, no reason why the lessons to be found in this experiment\ncannot
  be profitably employed in times of peace.  The information, the \ntechniques, and
  the research experience developed by the Office of Scientific\nResearch and Development
  and by the thousands of scientists in the universities\nand in private industry,
  should be used in the days of peace ahead for the \nimprovement of the national
  health, the creation of new enterprises bringing\nnew jobs, and the betterment of
  the national standard of living.\n\n  It is with that objective in mind that I would
  like to have your \nrecommendations on the following four major points:\n\n  First:
  What can be done, consistent with military security, and with the prior\napproval
  of the military authorities, to make known to the world as soon as\npossible the
  contributions which have been made during our war effort to\nscientific knowledge?\n\n
  \ The diffusion of such knowledge should help us stimulate new enterprises,\nprovide
  jobs four our returning servicemen and other workers, and make possible\ngreat strides
  for the improvement of the national well-being.\n\n  Second: With particular reference
  to the war of science against disease, what\ncan be done now to organize a program
  for continuing in the future the work\nwhich has been done in medicine and related
  sciences?\n\n  The fact that the annual deaths in this country from one or two diseases\nalone
  are far in excess of the total number of lives lost by us in battle\nduring this
  war should make us conscious of the duty we owe future generations.\n\n  Third:
  What can the Government do now and in the future to aid research\nactivities by
  public and private organizations?  The proper roles of public \nand of private research,
  and their interrelation, should be carefully \nconsidered.\n\n  Fourth: Can an effective
  program be proposed for discovering and developing\nscientific talent in American
  youth so that the continuing future of scientific\nresearch in this country may
  be assured on a level comparable to what has\nbeen done during the war?\n\n  New
  frontiers of the mind are before us, and if they are pioneered with the\nsame vision,
  boldness, and drive with which we have waged this war we can\ncreate a fuller and
  more fruitful employment and a fuller and more fruitful\nlife.\n\n  I hope that,
  after such consultation as you may deem advisable with your\nassociates and others,
  you can let me have your considered judgment on these\nmatters as soon as convenient
  - reporting on each when you are ready, rather\nthan waiting for completion of your
  studies in all.\n\n\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\t\t\t\t(s) FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT\n\n\n\nDr.
  VANNEVAR BUSH,\nOffice of Scientific Research and Development,\nWashington, D. C.\n\n\n__\n
  SCIENCE - THE ENDLESS FRONTIER  \n\n\n\"New frontiers of the mind are before us,
  and if they are pioneered with the\nsame vision, boldness, and drive with which
  we have waged this war we can\ncreate a fuller and more fruitful employment and
  a fuller and more fruitful\nlife.\"--\n\n\n  FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT\n  November 17,
  1944.\n\n\n___\n  SUMMARY OF THE REPORT  \n  ---\nSCIENTIFIC PROGRESS IS ESSENTIAL
  \n\n\n  Progress in the war against disease depends upon a flow of new scientific\nknowledge.
  \ New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous\nadditions to knowledge
  of the laws of nature, and the application of that\nknowledge to practical purposes.
  \ Similarly, our defense against aggression\ndemands new knowledge so that we can
  develop new and improved weapons.  This\nessential, new knowledge can be obtained
  only through basic scientific \nresearch.\n\n  Science can be effective in the national
  welfare only as a member of a team,\nwhether the conditions be peace or war.   But
  without scientific progress no\namount of achievement in other directions can insure
  our health, prosperity,\nand security as a nation in the modern world.\n\n\n For
  the War Against Disease \n\n \n  We have taken great strides in the war against
  disease.  The death rate for\nall diseases in the Army, including overseas forces,
  has been reduced from 14.1\nper thousand in the last war to 0.6 per thousand in
  this war.  In the last\n40 years life expectancy has increased from 49 to 65 years,
  largely as a \nconsequence of the reduction in the death rates of infants and children.
  \ But\nwe are far from the goal.  The annual deaths from one or two diseases far\nexceed
  the total number of American lives lost in battle during this war.\nA large fraction
  of these deaths in our civilian population cut short the \nuseful lives of our citizens.
  \ Approximately 7,000,000 persons in the United\nStates are mentally ill and their
  care costs the public over $175,000,000 a\nyear.  Clearly much illness remains for
  which adequate means of prevention and\ncure are not yet known.\n\n  The responsibility
  for basic research in medicine and the underlying sciences,\nso essential to progress
  in the war against disease, falls primarily upon\nthe medical schools and universities.
  \ Yet we find that the traditional\nsources of support for medical research in the
  medical schools and universities,\nlargely endowment income, foundation grants,
  and private donations, are \ndiminishing and there is no immediate prospect of a
  change in this trend.  \nMeanwhile, the cost of medical research has been rising.
  \ If we are to maintain\nthe progress in medicine which has marked the last 25 years,
  the Government\nshould extend financial support to basic medical research in the
  medical\nschools and in universities.\n\n\n For Our National Security \n\n\n  The
  bitter and dangerous battle against the U-boat was a battle of\nscientific techniques
  - and our margin of success was dangerously small.\nThe new eyes which radar has
  supplied can sometimes be blinded by\nnew scientific developments. V-2 was countered
  only by capture of\nthe launching sites.\n\n\n  We cannot again rely on our allies
  to hold off the enemy while we\nstruggle to catch up. There must be more - and more
  adequate - military\nresearch in peacetime. It is essential that the civilian scientists\ncontinue
  in peacetime some portion of those contributions to national\nsecurity which they
  have made so effectively during the war. This\ncan best be done through a civilian-controlled
  organization with close\nliaison with the Army and Navy, but with funds direct from
  Congress, and\nthe clear power to initiate military research which will supplement
  and\nstrengthen that carried on directly under the control of the Army and\nNavy.\n\n\n
  And for the Public Welfare \n\n\nOne of our hopes is that after the war there will
  be full employment.\nTo reach that goal the full creative and productive energies
  of the American\npeople must be released. To create more jobs we must make new and
  better\nand cheaper products. We want plenty of new, vigorous enterprises. But new\nproducts
  and processes are not born full-grown. They are founded on new\nprinciples and new
  conceptions which in turn result from basic scientific\nresearch. Basic scientific
  research is scientific capital. Moreover, we\ncannot any longer depend upon Europe
  as a major source of this scientific\ncapital. Clearly, more and better scientific
  research is one essential to the\nachievement of our goal of full employment.\n\n\nHow
  do we increase this scientific capital? First, we must have plenty\nof men and women
  trained in science, for upon them depends both the\ncreation of new knowledge and
  its application to practical purposes. Second,\nwe must strengthen the centers of
  basic research which are principally the\ncolleges, universities, and research institutes.
  These institutions provide\nthe environment which is most conducive to the creation
  of new scientific\nknowledge and least under pressure for immediate, tangible results.
  With\nsome notable exceptions, most research in industry and Government involves\napplication
  of existing scientific knowledge to practical problems. It is\nonly the colleges,
  universities, and a few research institutes that devote\nmost of their research
  efforts to expanding the frontiers of knowledge.\n\n\nExpenditures for scientific
  research by industry and Government increased from\n$140,000,000 in 1930 to $309,000,000
  in 1940. Those for the colleges and\nuniversities increased from $20,000,000 to
  $31,000,000, while those for the\nresearch institutes declined from $5,200,000 to
  $4,500,000 during the same\nperiod. If the colleges, universities, and research
  institutes are to meet\nthe rapidly increasing demands of industry and Government
  for new\nscientific knowledge, their basic research should be strengthened by use\nof
  public funds.\n\n\nFor science to serve as a powerful factor in our national welfare,
  applied\nresearch both in Government and in industry must be vigorous. To improve\nthe
  quality of scientific research within the Government, steps should be\ntaken to
  modify the procedures for recruiting, classifying, and compensating\nscientific
  personnel in order to reduce the present handicap of governmental\nscientific bureaus
  in competing with industry and the universities for\ntop-grade scientific talent.
  To provide coordination of the common\nscientific activities of these governmental
  agencies as to policies and\nbudgets, a permanent Science Advisory Board should
  be created to advise\nthe executive and legislative branches of Government on these
  matters.\n\n\nThe most important ways in which the Government can promote industrial\nresearch
  are to increase the flow of new scientific knowledge through support\nof basic research,
  and to aid in the development of scientific talent.\nIn addition, the Government
  should provide suitable incentives to industry\nto conduct research, (a) by clarification
  of present uncertainties\nin the Internal Revenue Code in regard to the deductibility
  of research\nand development expenditures as current charges against net income,
  and\n(b) by strengthening the patent system so as to eliminate uncertainties\nwhich
  now bear heavily on small industries and so as to prevent abuses\nwhich reflect
  discredit upon a basically sound system. In addition, ways\nshould be found to cause
  the benefits of basic research to reach industries\nwhich do not now utilize new
  scientific knowledge.\n\n\n\n WE MUST RENEW OUR SCIENTIFIC TALENT \n\n\nThe responsibility
  for the creation of new scientific knowledge - and for most\nof its application
  - rests on that small body of men and women who\nunderstand the fundamental laws
  of nature and are skilled in the techniques\nof scientific research. We shall have
  rapid or slow advance on any scientific\nfrontier depending on the number of highly
  qualified and trained scientists\nexploring it.\n\n\nThe deficit of science and
  technology students who, but for the war, would\nhave received bachelor's degrees
  is about 150,000. It is estimated that\nthe deficit of those obtaining advanced
  degrees in these fields will amount\nin 1955 to about 17,000 - for it takes at least
  6 years from college entry\nto achieve a doctor's degree or its equivalent in science
  or engineering.\nThe real ceiling on our productivity of new scientific knowledge
  and its\napplication in the war against disease, and the development of new\nproducts
  and new industries, is the number of trained scientists available.\n\n\nThe training
  of a scientist is a long and expensive process. Studies clearly\nshow that there
  are talented individuals in every part of the population,\nbut with few exceptions,
  those without the means of buying higher education\ngo without it. If ability, and
  not the circumstance of family fortune,\ndetermines who shall receive higher education
  in science, then we\nshall be assured of constantly improving quality at every level
  of\nscientific activity. The Government should provide a reasonable number of\nundergraduate
  scholarships and graduate fellowships in order to develop\nscientific talent in
  American youth. The plans should be designed to attract\ninto science only that
  proportion of youthful talent appropriate to the\nneeds of science in relation to
  the other needs of the nation for high\nabilities.\n\n\n\n Including Those in Uniform
  \n\nThe most immediate prospect of making up the deficit in scientific personnel\nis
  to develop the scientific talent in the generation now in uniform. Even\nif we should
  start now to train the current crop of high-school graduates\nnone would complete
  graduate studies before 1951. The Armed Services should\ncomb their records for
  men who, prior to or during the war, have given\nevidence of talent for science,
  and make prompt arrangements, consistent\nwith current discharge plans, for ordering
  those who remain in uniform,\nas soon as militarily possible, to duty at institutions
  here and overseas where\nthey can continue their scientific education. Moreover,
  the Services should\nsee that those who study overseas have the benefit of the latest
  scientific\ninformation resulting from research during the war.\n\n\n THE LID MUST
  BE LIFTED \n\nWhile most of the war research has involved the application of\nexisting
  scientific knowledge to the problems of war, rather than basic\nresearch, there
  has been accumulated a vast amount of information\nrelating to the application of
  science to particular problems. Much\nof this can be used by industry. It is also
  needed for teaching in\nthe colleges and universities here and in the Armed Forces
  Institutes\noverseas. Some of this information must remain secret, but most of it\nshould
  be made public as soon as there is ground for belief that the\nenemy will not be
  able to turn it against us in this war. To select that\nportion which should be
  made public, to coordinate its release,\nand definitely to encourage its publication,
  a Board composed of Army,\nNavy, and civilian scientific members should be promptly
  established.\n\n\n A PROGRAM FOR ACTION \n\n\nThe Government should accept new responsibilities
  for promoting\nthe flow of new scientific knowledge and the development of\nscientific
  talent in our youth. These responsibilities are the proper\nconcern of the Government,
  for they vitally affect our health, our\njobs, and our national security. It is
  in keeping also with basic United\nStates policy that the Government should foster
  the opening of new\nfrontiers and this is the modern way to do it. For many years
  the\nGovernment has wisely supported research in the agricultural colleges\nand
  the benefits have been great. The time has come when such support\nshould be extended
  to other fields.\n\n\nThe effective discharge of these new responsibilities will
  require\nthe full attention of some over-all agency devoted to that purpose. There\nis
  not now in the permanent Governmental structure receiving its funds\nfrom Congress
  an agency adapted to supplementing the support of basic\nresearch in the colleges,
  universities, and research institutes,\nboth in medicine and the natural sciences,
  adapted to supporting research\non new weapons for both Services, or adapted to
  administering a program\nof science scholarships and fellowships.\n\n\nTherefore
  I recommend that a new agency for these purposes be established.\nSuch an agency
  should be composed of persons of broad interest and\nexperience, having an understanding
  of the peculiarities of scientific\nresearch and scientific education. It should
  have stability of funds so\nthat long-range programs may be undertaken. It should
  recognize\nthat freedom of inquiry must be preserved and should leave internal\ncontrol
  of policy, personnel, and the method and scope of research to\nthe institutions
  in which it is carried on. It should be fully\nresponsible to the President and
  through him to the Congress for\nits program.\n\n\nEarly action on these recommendations
  is imperative if this nation\nis to meet the challenge of science in the crucial
  years ahead. On the\nwisdom with which we bring science to bear in the war against
  disease,\nin the creation of new industries, and in the strengthening of our\nArmed
  Forces depends in large measure our future as a nation.\n\n\n          Chapter 1
  INTRODUCTION  \n\n  Scientific Progress is Essential  \n\n\nWe all know how much
  the new drug, penicillin, has meant to our grievously\nwounded men on the grim battlefronts
  of this war - the countless lives it\nhas saved - the incalculable suffering which
  its use has prevented. Science\nand the great practical genius of this nation made
  this achievement possible.\n\n\nSome of us know the vital role which radar has played
  in bringing the United\nNations to victory over Nazi Germany and in driving the
  Japanese steadily\nback from their island bastions. Again it was painstaking scientific
  research\nover many years that made radar possible.\n\n\nWhat we often forget are
  the millions of pay envelopes on a peacetime Saturday \nnight which are filled because
  new products and new industries have provided\njobs for countless Americans.  Science
  made that possible, too.\n\n\nIn 1939 millions of people were employed in industries
  which did not even\nexist at the close of the last war - radio, air conditioning,
  rayon and other\nsynthetic fibers, and plastics are examples of the products of
  these industries.\nBut these things do not mark the end of progress - they are but
  the beginning\nif we make full use of our scientific resources.  New manufacturing
  industries\ncan be started and many older industries greatly strengthened and expanded
  if\nwe continue to study nature's laws and apply new knowledge to practical \npurposes.\n\n\nGreat
  advances in agriculture are also based upon scientific research.  Plants\nwhich
  are more resistant to disease and are adapted to short growing season,\nthe prevention
  and cure of livestock diseases, the control of our insect\nenemies, better fertilizers,
  and improved agricultural practices, all stem\nfrom painstaking scientific research.\n\n\nAdvances
  in science when put to practical use mean more jobs, higher wages,\nshorter hours,
  more abundant crops, more leisure for recreation, for study,\nfor learning how to
  live without the deadening drudgery which has been the\nburden of the common man
  for ages past.  Advances in science will also \nbring higher standards of living,
  will lead to the prevention or cure of \ndiseases, will promote conservation of
  our limited national resources, and\nwill assure means of defense against aggression.
  \ But to achieve these \nobjectives - to secure a high level of employment, to maintain
  a position\nof world leadership - the flow of new scientific knowledge must be both
  \ncontinuous and substantial.\n\n\nOur population increased from 75 million to 130
  million between 1900 and\n1940. In some countries comparable increases have been
  accompanied by\nfamine. In this country the increase has been accompanied by\nmore
  abundant food supply, better living, more leisure, longer life, and\nbetter health.
  This is, largely, the product of three factors - the free play of\ninitiative of
  a vigorous people under democracy, the heritage of great\nnational wealth, and the
  advance of science and its application.\n\n\nScience, by itself, provides no panacea
  for individual, social, and economic\nills. It can be effective in the national
  welfare only as a member of a team,\nwhether the conditions be peace or war. But
  without scientific progress\nno amount of achievement in other directions can insure
  our health,\nprosperity, and security as a nation in the modern world.\n\n\n\n  Science
  Is a Proper Concern of Government  \n\n\nIt has been basic United States policy
  that Government should foster the\nopening of new frontiers. It opened the seas
  to clipper ships and\nfurnished land for pioneers. Although these frontiers have
  more or less\ndisappeared, the frontier of science remains. It is in keeping with
  the\nAmerican tradition - one which has made the United States great -\nthat new
  frontiers shall be made accessible for development by\nall American citizens.\n\n\nMoreover,
  since health, well-being, and security are proper concerns of\nGovernment, scientific
  progress is, and must be, of vital interest\nto Government. Without scientific progress
  the national health would\ndeteriorate; without scientific progress we could not
  hope for\nimprovement in our standard of living or for an increased number of jobs\nfor
  our citizens; and without scientific progress we could not have maintained\nour
  liberties against tyranny.\n\n\n\n  Government Relations to Science - Past and Future
  \ \n\n\nFrom early days the Government has taken an active interest in scientific\nmatters.
  During the nineteenth century the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the\nNaval Observatory,
  the Department of Agriculture, and the Geological\nSurvey were established. Through
  the Land Grant College acts the\nGovernment has supported research in state institutions
  for more than 80 years\non a gradually increasing scale. Since 1900 a large number
  of scientific\nagencies have been established within the Federal Government, until
  in 1939\nthey numbered more than 40.\n\n\nMuch of the scientific research done by
  Government agencies is intermediate\nin character between the two types of work
  commonly referred to as\nbasic and applied research. Almost all Government scientific
  work has\nultimate practical objectives but, in many fields of broad national concern,\nit
  commonly involves long-term investigation of a fundamental nature.\nGenerally speaking,
  the scientific agencies of Government are not so\nconcerned with immediate practical
  objectives as are the laboratories\nof industry nor, on the other hand, are they
  as free to explore any\nnatural phenomena without regard to possible economic applications
  as\nare the educational and private research institutions. Government scientific\nagencies
  have splendid records of achievement, but they are limited\nin function.\n\n\nWe
  have no national policy for science. The Government has only begun\nto utilize science
  in the nation's welfare. There is no body within the\nGovernment charged with formulating
  or executing a national science\npolicy. There are no standing committees of the
  Congress devoted to\nthis important subject. Science has been in the wings. It should
  be brought to\nthe center of the stage - for in it lies much of our hope for the
  future.\n\n\nThere are areas of science in which the public interest is acute but
  which\nare likely to be cultivated inadequately if left without more support than\nwill
  come from private sources. These areas - such as research on military\nproblems,
  agriculture, housing, public health, certain medical research,\nand research involving
  expensive capital facilities beyond the capacity\nof private institutions - should
  be advanced by active Government support.\nTo date, with the exception of the intensive
  war research conducted by\nthe Office of Scientific Research and Development, such
  support has been\nmeager and intermittent.\n\n\nFor reasons presented in this report
  we are entering a period when science\nneeds and deserves increased support from
  public funds.\n\n\n\n  Freedom of Inquiry Must Be Preserved  \n\n\nThe publicly
  and privately supported colleges, universities, and research\ninstitutes are the
  centers of basic research. They are the wellsprings of\nknowledge and understanding.
  As long as they are vigorous and healthy\nand their scientists are free to pursue
  the truth wherever it may\nlead, there will be a flow of new scientific knowledge
  to those who can apply\nit to practical problems in Government, in industry, or
  elsewhere.\n\n\nMany of the lessons learned in the war-time application of science
  under\nGovernment can be profitably applied in peace. The Government is peculiarly\nfitted
  to perform certain functions, such as the coordination and support of\nbroad programs
  on problems of great national importance. But we must proceed\nwith caution in carrying
  over the methods which work in wartime to the\nvery different conditions of peace.
  We must remove the rigid controls\nwhich we have had to impose, and recover freedom
  of inquiry and that healthy\ncompetitive scientific spirit so necessary for expansion
  of the frontiers\nof scientific knowledge.\n\n\nScientific progress on a broad front
  results from the free play of free\nintellects, working on subjects of their own
  choice, in the manner dictated\nby their curiosity for exploration of the unknown.
  Freedom of inquiry\nmust be preserved under any plan for Government support of science\nin
  accordance with the Five Fundamentals listed on\n page 26 .\n\n\nThe study of the
  momentous questions presented in President Roosevelt's\nletter has been made by
  able committees working diligently. This report\npresents conclusions and recommendations
  based upon the studies of\nthese committees which appear in full as the appendices.
  Only in the\ncreation of one over-all mechanism rather than several does this report\ndepart
  from the specific recommendations of the committees. The members of\nthe committees
  have reviewed the recommendations in regard to the single\nmechanism and have found
  this plan thoroughly acceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Chapter 2  THE WAR AGAINST
  DISEASE  \n\n  In War  \n\n\nThe death rate for all diseases in the Army, including
  the overseas forces,\nhas been reduced from 14.1 per thousand in the last war to
  0.6 per thousand\nin this war. \n\n\nSuch ravaging diseases as yellow fever, dysentery,
  typhus, tetanus, pneumonia,\nand meningitis have been all but conquered by penicillin
  and the sulfa drugs,\nthe insecticide DDT, better vaccines, and improved hygenic
  measures.  Malaria\nhas been controlled.  There has been dramatic progress in surgery.\n\n\nThe
  striking advances in medicine during the war have been possible only because\nwe
  had a large backlog of scientific data accumulated through basic research\nin many
  scientific fields in the years before the war.\n\n\n  In Peace  \n\n\nIn the last
  40 years life expectancy in the United States has increased from\n49 to 65 years
  largely as a consequence of the reduction in the death rates of\ninfants and children;
  in the last 20 years the death rate from the diseases\nof childhood has been reduced
  87 percent.\n\n\nDiabetes has been brought under control by insulin, pernicious
  anemia by\nliver extracts; and the once widespread deficiency diseases have been
  much\nreduced, even in the lowest income groups, by accessory food factors and\nimprovement
  of diet.  Notable advances have been made in the early diagnosis\nof cancer, and
  in the surgical and radiation treatment of the disease.\n\n\nThese results have
  been achieved through a great amount of basic research \nin medicine and the preclinical
  sciences, and by the dissemination of this\nnew scientific knowledge through the
  physicians and medical services and\npublic health agencies of the country.  In
  this cooperative endeavour the\npharmaceutical industry has played an important
  role, especially during the\nwar.  All of the medical and public health groups share
  credit for these\nachievements; they form interdependent members of a team.\n\n\nProgress
  in combating disease depends upon an expanding body of new scientific\nknowledge.\n\n\n
  \ Unsolved Problems  \n\n\nAs President Roosevelt observed, the annual deaths from
  one or two diseases\nare far in excess of the total number of American lives lost
  in battle during\nthis war.  A large fraction of these deaths in our civilian population
  cut\nshort the useful lives of our citizens.  This is our present position despite\nthe
  fact that in the last three decades notable progress has been made in \ncivilian
  medicine.  The reduction in death rate from diseases of childhood\nhas shifted the
  emphasis to the middle and old age groups, particularly to\nthe malignant diseases
  and the degenerative processes prominent in later\nlife.  Cardiovascular disease,
  including chronic disease of the kidneys,\narteriosclerosis, and cerebral hemorrhage,
  now account for 45 percent of the\ndeaths in the United States.  Second are the
  infectious diseases, and third\nis cancer.  Added to these are many maladies (for
  example, the common cold,\narthritis, asthma and hay fever, peptic ulcer) which,
  through infrequently\nfatal, cause incalculable disability.\n\n\nAnother aspect
  of the changing emphasis is the increase of mental diseases.\nApproximately 7 million
  persons in the United States are mentally ill; more\nthan one-third of the hospital
  beds are occupied by such persons, at a cost\nof $175 million a year.  Each year
  125,000 new mental cases are hospitalized.\n\n\nNotwithstanding great progress in
  prolonging the span of life and relief\nof suffering, much illness remains for which
  adequate means of prevention\nand cure are not yet known.  While additional physicians,
  hospitals, and \nhealth programs are needed, their full usefulness cannot be attained
  unless\nwe enlarge our knowledge of the human organism and the nature of disease.\nAny
  extension of medical facilities must be accompanied by an expanded program\nof medical
  training and research.\n\n\n Broad and Basic Studies Needed  \n\n\nDiscoveries pertinent
  to medical progress have often come from remote and\nunexpected sources, and it
  is certain that this will be true in the future.\nIt is wholly probable that progress
  in the treatment of cardiovascular\ndisease, renal disease, cancer, and similar
  refractory diseases will be\nmade as the result of fundamental discoveries in subjects
  unrelated to those\ndiseases, and perhaps entirely unexpected by the investigator.
  \ Further progress\nrequires that the entire front of medicine and the underlying
  sciences of \nchemistry, physics, anatomy, biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology,\nbacteriology,
  pathology, parasitology, etc., be broadly developed.\n\n\nProgress in the war against
  disease results from discoveries in remote and\nunexpected fields of medicine and
  the underlying sciences.\n\n\n  Coordinated Attack on Special Problems  \n\n\nPenicillin
  reached our troops in time to save countless lives because the \nGovernment coordinated
  and supported the program of research and development\non the drug.  The development
  moved from the early laboratory stage to large\nscale production and use in a fraction
  of the time it would have taken without\nsuch leadership.  The search for better
  anti-malarials, which proceeded at a\nmoderate tempo for many years, has been accelerated
  enormously by Government\nsupport during the war.  Other examples can be cited in
  which medical progress\nhas been similarly advanced.  In achieving these results,
  the Government has\nprovided over-all coordination and support; it has not dictated
  how the work\nshould be done within any cooperating institution.\n\n\nDiscovery
  of new therapeutic agents and methods usually results from basic\nstudies in medicine
  and the underlying sciences.  The development of such\nmaterials and methods to
  the point at which they become available to\nmedical practitioners requires teamwork
  involving the medical schools, the\nscience departments of universities, Government
  and the pharmaceutical\nindustry.  Government initiative, support, and coordination
  can be very\neffective in this development phase.\n\n\nGovernment initiative and
  support for the development of newly discovered\ntherapeutic materials and methods
  can reduce the time required to bring the\nbenefits to the public.\n\n\n Action
  is Necessary  \n\n\nThe primary place for medical research is in the medical schools
  and \nuniversities.  In some cases coordinated direct attack on special problems\nmay
  be made by teams of investigators, supplementing similar attacks carried\non by
  the Army, Navy, Public Health Service, and other organizations.  Apart\nfrom teaching,
  however, the primary obligation of the medical schools and \nuniversities is to
  continue the traditional function of such institutions, \nnamely,  to provide the
  individual worker with an opportunity for free,\nuntrammeled study of nature, in
  the directions and by the methods suggested\nby his interests, curiosity, and imagination.
  \ The history of medical science\nteaches clearly the supreme importance of affording
  the prepared mind complete\nfreedom for the exercise of initiative.  It is the special
  province of the \nmedical schools and universities to foster medical research in
  this way - a duty\nwhich cannot be shifted to government agencies, industrial organizations,
  or\nto any other institutions.\n\n\nWhere clinical investigations of the human body
  are required, the medical \nschools are in a unique position, because of their close
  relationship to \nteaching hospitals, to integrate such investigations with the
  work of the\ndepartments of preclinical science, and to impart new knowledge to
  physicians\nin training.  At the same time, the teaching hospitals are especially
  well\nqualified to carry on medical research because of their close connection with\nthe
  medical schools, on which they depend for staff and supervision.\n\n\nBetween World
  War I and World War II the United States overtook all other \nnations in medical
  research and assumed a position of world leadership. To\na considerable extent this
  progress reflected the liberal financial support\nfrom university endowment income,
  gifts from individuals, and foundation \ngrants in the 20's.  The growth of research
  departments in medical schools\nahs been very uneven, however, and in consequence
  most of the important work\nhas been done in a few large schools.  This should be
  corrected by building up\nthe weaker institutions, especially in regions which now
  have no strong medical\nresearch activities.  \n\n\nThe traditional sources of support
  for medical research, largely endowment\nincome, foundation grants, and private
  donations, are diminishing, and there is\nno immediate prospect of a change in this
  trend.  Meanwhile, research costs have\nsteadily risen.  More elaborate and expensive
  equipment is required, supplies\nare more costly, and the wages of assistants are
  higher.  Industry is only to\na limited extent a source of funds for basic medical
  research.\n\n\nIt is clear that if we are to maintain the progress in medicine which
  has\nmarked the last 25 years, the Government should extend financial support to\nbasic
  medical research in the medical schools and in the universities, through\ngrants
  both for research and for fellowships.  The amount which can be \neffectively spent
  in the first year should not exceed 5 million dollars.\nAfter a program is under
  way perhaps 20 million dollars a year can be spent\neffectively.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n
  Chapter 3  SCIENCE AND THE PUBLIC WELFARE  \n\n Relation to National Security  \n\n\nIn
  this war it has become clear beyond all doubt that scientific research is\nabsolutely
  essential to national security.  The bitter and dangerous battle\nagainst the U-boat
  was a battle of scientific techniques - and our margin of\nsuccess was dangerously
  small.  The new eyes which radar supplied to our\nfighting forces quickly evoked
  the development of scientific countermeasures\nwhich could often blind them. This
  again represents the ever continuing battle\nof techniques.  The V-1 attack on London
  was finally defeated by three devices\ndeveloped during this war and used superbly
  in the field.  V-2 was countered\nonly by the capture of the launching sites.\n\n\nThe
  Secretaries of War and Navy recently stated in a joint letter to the\nNational Academy
  of Sciences:\n\n\nThis war emphasizes three facts of supreme importance to national
  security:\n(1) Powerful new tactics of defense and offense are developed around
  new\nweapons created by scientific and engineering research; (2) the competitive\ntime
  element in developing those weapons and tactics may be decisive; (3) war\nis increasingly
  total war, in which the armed services must be supplemented by\nactive participation
  of every element of civilian population.\n\n\nTo insure continued preparedness along
  farsighted technical lines, the research\nscientists of the country must be called
  upon to continue in peacetime some\nsubstantial portion of those types of contribution
  to national security which\nthey have made so effectively during the stress of the
  present war * * *.\n\n\nThere must be more - and more adequate - military research
  during peacetime.\nWe cannot again rely on our allies to hold off the enemy while
  we struggle\nto catch up.  Further, it is clear that only the Government can undertake\nmilitary
  research; for it must be carried on in secret, much of it has no\ncommercial value,
  and it is expensive.  The obligation of Government to support\nresearch on military
  problems is inescapable.\n\n\nModern war requires the use of the most advanced scientific
  techniques.  Many\nof the leaders in the development of radar are scientists who
  before the war\nhad been exploring the nucleus of the atom.  While there must be
  increased\nemphasis on science in the future training of officers for both the Army
  and\nNavy, such men cannot be expected to be specialists in scientific research.\nTherefore
  a professional partnership between the officers in the Services\nand civilian scientists
  is needed.\n\n\nThe Army and Navy should continue to carry on research and development
  on the\nimprovement of current weapons.  For many years the National Advisory Committee\nfor
  Aeronautics has supplemented the work of the Army and Navy by conducting\nbasic
  research on the problems of flight.  There should now be permanent \ncivilian activity
  to supplement the research work of the Services in other\nscientific fields so as
  to carry on in time of peace some part of the \nactivities of the emergency war-time
  Office of Scientific Research and \nDevelopment.\n\n\nMilitary preparedness requires
  a permanent independent, civilian-controlled\norganization, having close liaison
  with the Army and Navy, but with funds\ndirectly from Congress and with the clear
  power to initiate military research\nwhich will supplement and strengthen that carried
  on directly under the control\nof the Army and Navy.\n\n\nMilitary preparedness
  requires a permanent independent, civilian-controlled\norganization, having close
  liaison with the Army and Navy, but with funds\ndirectly from Congress and with
  the clear power to initiate military research\nwhich will supplement and strengthen
  that carried on directly under the control\nof the Army and Navy.\n\n\n Science
  and Jobs  \n\n\nOne of our hopes is that after the war there will be full employment,
  and \nthat the production of goods and services will serve to raise our standard\nof
  living.  We do not know yet how we shall reach that goal, but it is certain\nthat
  it can be achieved only by releasing the full creative and productive\nenergies
  of the American people. \n\n\nSurely we will not get there by standing still, merely
  by making the same\nthings we made before and selling them at the same or higher
  prices.  We\nwill not get ahead in international trade unless we offer new and more
  \nattractive and cheaper products. \n\n\nWhere will these new products come from?
  \ How will we find ways to make better\nproducts at lower cost?  The answer is clear.
  \ There must be a stream of new\nscientific knowledge to turn the wheels of private
  and public enterprise.  There\nmust be plenty of men and women trained in science
  and technology for upon\nthem depend both the creation of new knowledge and its
  application to practical\npurposes.\n\n\nMore and better scientific research is
  essential to the achievement of our\ngoal of full employment.\n\n\n The Importance
  of Basic Research  \n\n\nBasic research is performed without thought of practical
  ends.  It results\nin general knowledge and an understanding of nature and its laws.
  \ This \ngeneral knowledge provides the means of answering a large number of important\npractical
  problems, though it may not give a complete specific answer to any\none of them.
  \ The function of applied research is to provide such complete\nanswers.  The scientist
  doing basic research may not be at all interested in\nthe practical applications
  of his work, yet the further progress of industrial\ndevelopment would eventually
  stagnate if basic scientific research were long\nneglected. \n\n\nOne of the peculiarities
  of basic science is the variety of paths which lead\nto productive advance.  Many
  of the most important discoveries have come as\na result of experiments undertaken
  with very different purposes in mind.  \nStatistically it is certain that important
  and highly useful discoveries will\nresult from some fraction of the undertakings
  in basic science; but the results\nof any one particular investigation cannot be
  predicted with accuracy.\n\n\nBasic research leads to new knowledge.  It provides
  scientific capital.  It\ncreates the fund from which the practical applications
  of knowledge must be\ndrawn.  New products and new processes do not appear full-grown.
  \ They are\nfounded on new principles and new conceptions, which in turn are painstakingly\ndeveloped
  by research in the purest realms of science.\n\n\nToday, it is truer than ever that
  basic research is the pacemaker of\ntechnological progress.  In the nineteenth century,
  Yankee mechanical ingenuity,\nbuilding largely upon the basic discoveries of European
  scientists, could \ngreatly advance the technical arts.  Now the situation is different.\n\n\nA
  nation which depends upon others for its new basic scientific knowledge\nwill be
  slow in its industrial progress and weak in its competitive position\nin world trade,
  regardless of its mechanical skill.\n\n\n\n\n Centers of Basic Research  \n\n\nPublicly
  and privately supported colleges and universities and\nthe endowed research institutes
  must furnish both the new scientific\nknowledge and the trained research workers.
  These institutions are uniquely\nqualified by tradition and by their special characteristics
  to carry\non basic research. They are charged with the responsibility of conserving\nthe
  knowledge accumulated by the past, imparting that knowledge to\nstudents, and contributing
  new knowledge of all kinds. It is chiefly in\nthese institutions that scientists
  may work in an atmosphere which is\nrelatively free from the adverse pressure of
  convention, prejudice,\nor commercial necessity. At their best they provide the
  scientific\nworker with a strong sense of solidarity and security, as well as a\nsubstantial
  degree of personal intellectual freedom. All of these\nfactors are of great importance
  in the development of new knowledge,\nsince much of new knowledge is certain to
  arouse opposition because\nof its tendency to challenge current beliefs or practice.\n\n\nIndustry
  is generally inhibited by preconceived goals, by its own clearly\ndefined standards,
  and by the constant pressure of commercial necessity.\nSatisfactory progress in
  basic science seldom occurs under conditions\nprevailing in the normal industrial
  laboratory. There are some notable\nexceptions, it is true, but even in such cases
  it is rarely possible\nto match the universities in respect to the freedom which
  is so important\nto scientific discovery.\n\n\nTo serve effectively as the centers
  of basic research these institutions\nmust be strong and healthy. They must attract
  our best scientists as\nteachers and investigators. They must offer research opportunities
  and\nsufficient compensation to enable them to compete with industry and\ngovernment
  for the cream of scientific talent.\n\n\nDuring the past 25 years there has been
  a great increase in industrial\nresearch involving the application of scientific
  knowledge to a\nmultitude of practical purposes - thus providing new products, new\nindustries,
  new investment opportunities, and millions of jobs.\nDuring the same period research
  within Government - again largely\napplied research - has also been greatly expanded.
  In the decade\nfrom 1930 to 1940 expenditures for industrial research increased
  from\n$116,000,000 to $240,000,000 and those for scientific research in\nGovernment
  rose from $24,000,000 to $69,000,000. During the same\nperiod expenditures for scientific
  research in the colleges and\nuniversities increased from $20,000,000 to $31,000,000,
  while those\nin the endowed research institutes declined from $5,200,000 to\n$4,500,000.
  These are the best estimates available. The figures\nhave been taken from a variety
  of sources and arbitrary definitions\nhave necessarily been applied, but it is believed
  that they may be\naccepted as indicating the following trends:\n\n\n (a) Expenditures
  for scientific research by industry and Government -\n     almost entirely applied
  research - have more than doubled between\n     1930 and 1940. Whereas in 1930 they
  were six times as large as\n     the research expenditures of the colleges, universities,
  and research\n     institutes, by 1940 they were nearly ten times as large.\n (b)
  While expenditures for scientific research in the colleges and\n     universities
  increased by one-half during this period, those for\n     the endowed research institutes
  have slowly declined.\n\nIf the colleges, universities, and research institutes
  are to meet the rapidly\nincreasing demands of industry and Government for new scientific
  knowledge,\ntheir basic research should be strengthened by use of public funds.\n\n\n\n
  Research Within the Government  \n\n\nAlthough there are some notable exceptions,
  most research\nconducted within governmental laboratories is of an applied nature.\nThis
  has always been true and is likely to remain so. Hence\nGovernment, like industry,
  is dependent on the colleges, universities,\nand research institutes to expand the
  basic scientific frontiers and\nto furnish trained scientific investigators.\n\n\nResearch
  within the Government represents an important part of our\ntotal research activity
  and needs to be strengthened and expanded\nafter the war. Such expansion should
  be directed to fields of inquiry and\nservice which are of public importance and
  are not adequately carried\non by private organizations.\n\n\nThe most important
  single factor in scientific and technical work is\nthe quality of the personnel
  employed. The procedures currently\nfollowed within the Government for recruiting,
  classifying and compensating\nsuch personnel place the Government under a severe
  handicap in competing\nwith industry and the universities for first-class scientific
  talent. Steps\nshould be taken to reduce that handicap.\n\n\nIn the Government the
  arrangement whereby the numerous scientific\nagencies form parts of larger departments
  has both advantages\nand disadvantages. but the present pattern is firmly established
  and\nthere is much to be said for it. There is, however, a very real need for\nsome
  measure of coordination of the common scientific activities of\nthese agencies,
  both as to policies and budgets, and at present no such\nmeans exist.\n\n\n\nA permanent
  Science Advisory Board should be created to consult with\nthese scientific bureaus
  and to advise the executive and legislative\nbranches of Government as to the policies
  and budgets of Government\nagencies engaged in scientific research.\n\n\nThis board
  should be composed of disinterested scientists who have no\nconnection with the
  affairs of any Government agency.\n\n\n\n Industrial Research  \n\n\nThe simplest
  and most effective way in which the Government can\nstrengthen industrial research
  is to support basic research and to\ndevelop scientific talent.\n\n\nThe benefits
  of basic research do not reach all industries equally or at\nthe same speed. Some
  small enterprises never receive any of the\nbenefits. It has been suggested that
  the benefits might be better utilized\nif \"research clinics\" for such enterprises
  were to be established. Businessmen\nwould thus be able to make more use of research
  than they now do. This\nproposal is certainly worthy of further study.\n\n\nOne
  of the most important factors affecting the amount of industrial\nresearch is the
  income-tax law. Government action in respect to this\nsubject will affect the rate
  of technical progress in industry.\nUncertainties as to the attitude of the Bureau
  of Internal Revenue\nregarding the deduction of research and development expenses
  are\na deterrent to research expenditure. These uncertainties arise from\nlack of
  clarity of the tax law as to the proper treatment of such costs.\n\n\n\nThe Internal
  Revenue Code should be amended to remove present\nuncertainties in regard to the
  deductibility of research and development\nexpenditures as current charges against
  net income.\n\n\n\nResearch is also affected by the patent laws. They stimulate
  new invention\nand they make it possible for new industries to be built around new\ndevices
  or new processes. These industries generate new jobs and new\nproducts, all of which
  contribute to the welfare and the strength of the\ncountry.\n\n\nYet, uncertainties
  in the operation of the patent laws have\nimpaired the ability of small industries
  to translate new ideas into\nprocesses and products of value to the nation. These
  uncertainties\nare, in part, attributable to the difficulties and expense incident\nto
  the operation of the patent system as it presently exists. These\nuncertainties
  are also attributable to the existence of certain\nabuses, which have appeared in
  the use of patents. The abuses should\nbe corrected. They have led to extravagantly
  critical attacks which tend\nto discredit a basically sound system.\n\n\nIt is important
  that the patent system continue to serve the country\nin the manner intended by
  the Constitution, for it has been a vital\nelement in the industrial vigor which
  has distinguished this nation.\n\n\nThe National Patent Planning Commission has
  reported on this subject.\nIn addition, a detailed study, with recommendations concerning\nthe
  extent to which modifications should be made in our patent laws\nis currently being
  made under the leadership of the Secretary of Commerce.\nIt is recommended, therefore,
  that specific action with regard to the\npatent laws be withheld pending the submission
  of the report devoted\nexclusively to that subject.\n\n\n International Exchange
  of Scientific Information  \n\n\nInternational exchange of scientific information
  is of growing importance.\nIncreasing specialization of science will make it more
  important\nthan ever that scientists in this country keep continually ahead of\ndevelopments
  abroad. In addition a flow of scientific information constitutes\none facet of general
  international accord which should be cultivated.\n\n\nThe Government can accomplish
  significant results in several ways: by aiding\nin the arrangement of international
  science congresses, in the\nofficial accrediting of American scientists to such
  gatherings, in the\nofficial reception of foreign scientists of standing in this
  country,\nin making possible a rapid flow of technical information, including\ntranslation
  service, and possibly in the provision of international\nfellowships. Private foundations
  and other groups partially fulfill some of\nthese functions at present, but their
  scope is incomplete and inadequate.\n\n\n\nThe Government should take an active
  role in promoting the international\nflow of scientific information.\n\n\n The Special
  Need for Federal Support  \n\n\nWe can no longer count on ravaged Europe as a source
  of fundamental knowledge.\nIn the past we have devoted much of our best efforts
  to the application of \nsuch knowledge which has been discovered abroad.  In the
  future we must pay\nincreased attention to discovering this knowledge for ourselves
  particularly\nsince the scientific applications of the future will be more than
  ever dependent\nupon such basic knowledge.\n\n\nNew impetus must be given to research
  in our country.   Such impetus can come\npromptly only from the Government.  Expenditures
  for research in the colleges,\nuniversities, and research institutes will otherwise
  not be able to meet the\nadditional demands of increased public need for research.\n\n\nFurther,
  we cannot expect industry adequately to fill the gap.  Industry will\nfully rise
  to the challenge of applying new knowledge to new products.  The\ncommercial incentive
  can be relied upon for that.  But basic research is \nessentially noncommercial
  in nature.  It will not receive the attention it\nrequires if left to industry.\n\n\nFor
  many years the Government has wisely supported research in the agricultural\ncolleges
  and the benefits have been great.  The time has come when such support\nshould be
  extended to other fields.  \n\n\nIn providing government support, however, we must
  endeavor to preserve as far\nas possible the private support of research both in
  industry and in the \ncolleges, universities, and research institutes.  These private
  sources should\ncontinue to carry their share of the financial burden.\n\n\n The
  Cost of a Program  \n\n\nIt is estimated that an adequate program for Federal support
  of basic research\nin the colleges, universities, and research institutes and for
  financing\nimportant applied research in the public interest, will cost about 10
  million\ndollars at the outset and may rise to about 50 million dollars annually
  when\nfully underway at the end of perhaps 5 years.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter 4 RENEWAL
  OF OUR SCIENTIFIC TALENT  \n\n Nature of the Problem  \n\n\nThe responsibility for
  the creation of new scientific knowledge rests on \nthat small body of men and women
  who understand the fundamental laws of\nnature and are skilled in the techniques
  of scientific research.  While there\nwill always be the rare individual who will
  rise to the top without benefit\nof formal education and training, he is the exception
  and even he might make \na more notable contribution if he had the benefit of the
  best education we\nhave to offer.  I cannot improve on President Conant's statement
  that:\n\n\n \"* * * in every section of the entire area where the word science may
  properly\nbe applied, the limiting factor is a human one.  We shall have rapid or
  slow\nadvance in this direction or in that depending on the number of really \nfirst-class
  men who are engaged in the work in question.  * * * So in the last\nanalysis, the
  future of science in this country will be determined by our basic\neducational policy.\"\n\n\n
  A Note of Warning  \n\n\nIt would be folly to set up a program under which research
  in the natural\nsciences and medicine was expanded at the cost of the social sciences,
  \nhumanities, and other studies so essential to national well-being.  This point\nhas
  been well stated by the Moe Committee as follows:\n\n\n\" As citizens, as good citizens,
  we therefore think that we must have in \nmind while examining the question before
  us - the discovery and development\nof scientific talent - the needs of the whole
  national welfare.  We could\nnot suggest to you a program which would syphon into
  science and technology\na disproportionately large share of the nation's highest
  abilities, without \ndoing harm to the nation, nor, indeed, without crippling science.
  \ * * * Science\ncannot live by and unto itself alone.\"\n\n\n    *     *    *     *
  \   *     *    *     *    *     *    *     *    *     *\n\n\n\n\"The uses to which
  high ability in youth can be put are various and, to a large\nextent, are determined
  by social pressures and rewards.  When aided by selective\ndevices for picking out
  scientifically talented youth, it is clear that large\nsums of money for scholarships
  and fellowships and monetary and other rewards\nin disproportionate amounts might
  draw into science too large a percentage\nof the nation's high ability, with a result
  highly detrimental to the nation\nand to science.  Plans for the discovery and development
  of scientific talent\nmust be related to the other needs of society for high ability.
  \ * * * There\nis never enough ability at high levels to satisfy all the needs of
  the nation;\nwe would not seek to draw into science any more of it than science's
  \nproportionate share.\"\n\n\n The Wartime Deficit  \n \n\nAmong the young men and
  women qualified to take up scientific work, since 1940\nthere have been few students
  over 18, except some in medicine and engineering\nin Army and Navy programs and
  a few 4-F's, who have followed an integrated\nscientific course of studies.  Neither
  our allies nor, so far as we know, our\nenemies have done anything so radical as
  thus to suspend almost completely\ntheir educational activities in scientific pursuits
  during the war period.\n\n\nTwo great principles have guided us in this country
  as we have turned our full\nefforts to war.  First, the sound democratic principle
  that there should be no\nfavored classes or special privilege in a time of peril,
  that all should be \nready to sacrifice equally; second,  the tenet that every man
  should serve in\nthe capacity in which his talents and experience can best be applied
  for the\nprosecution of the war effort.  In general we have held these principles
  well\nin balance.\n\n\nIn my opinion, however, we have drawn too heavily for nonscientific
  purposes\nupon the great natural resource which resides in our trained young scientists\nand
  engineers.  For the general good of the country too many such men have gone\ninto
  uniform, and their talents have not always been fully utilized.  With the\nexception
  of those men engaged in war research, all physically fit students\nat graduate level
  have been taken into the armed forces.  Those ready for \ncollege training in the
  sciences have not been permitted to enter upon that\ntraining.\n\n\nThere is thus
  an accumulating deficit of trained research personnel which will\ncontinue for many
  years.  The deficit of science and technology students who,\nbut for the war, would
  have received bachelor's degrees is about 150,000.  The\ndeficit of those holding
  advanced degrees - that is, young scholars trained to\nthe point where they are
  capable of carrying on original work - has been \nestimated as amounting to about
  17,000 by 1955 in chemistry, engineering,\ngeology, mathematics, physics, psychology,
  and the biological sciences.\n\n\nWith mounting demands for scientists both for
  teaching and for research, we \nwill enter the post-war period with a serious deficit
  in our trained scientific\npersonnel.\n\n\n Improve the Quality  \n\n\nConfronted
  with these deficits, we are compelled to look to the use of our \nbasic human resources
  and formulate a program which will assure their \nconservation and effective development.
  \ The committee advising me on scientific\npersonnel has stated the following principle
  which should guide our planning:\n\n\n\"If we were all-knowing and all-wise we might,
  but we think probably not, write\nyou a plan whereby there might be selected for
  training, which they otherwise\nwould not get, those who, 20 years hence, would
  be scientific leaders, and we\nmight not bother about any lesser manifestations
  of scientific ability.  But in\nthe present state of knowledge a plan cannot be
  made which will select, and \nassist, only those young men and women who will give
  the top future leadership\nto science.  To get top leadership there must be a relatively
  large base of\nhigh ability selected for development and then successive skimmings
  of the cream\nof ability at successive times and at higher levels.  No one can select
  from\nthe bottom those who will be the leaders at the top because unmeasured and\nunknown
  factors enter into scientific, or any, leadership.  There are brains\nand character,
  strength and health, happiness and spiritual vitality, interest\nand motivation,
  and no one knows what else, that must needs enter into this\nsupra-mathematical
  calculus.\n\n\n\"We think we probably would not, even if we were all-wise and all-knowing,
  write\nyou a plan whereby you would be assured of scientific leadership at one stroke.\nWe
  think as we think because we are not interested in setting up an elect.\nWe think
  it much the best plan, in this constitutional Republic,\nthat opportunity be held
  out to all kinds and conditions of men whereby they\ncan better themselves.  This
  is the American way; this is the way the United\nStates has become what it is.  We
  think it very important that circumstances\nbe such that there be no ceilings, other
  than ability itself, to intellectual\nambition.  We think it very important that
  every boy and girl shall know that,\nif he shows that he has what it takes, the
  sky is the limit.  Even if it be\nshown subsequently that he has not what it takes
  to go to the top, he will go\nfurther than he would otherwise go if there had been
  a ceiling beyond which\nhe always knew he could not aspire.\n\n\n\"By proceeding
  from point to point and taking stock on the way, by giving \nfurther opportunity
  to those who show themselves worthy of further opportunity,\nby giving the most
  opportunity to those who show themselves continually \ndeveloping - this is the
  way we propose.  This is the American way:  a man work\nfor what he gets.\"\n\n\n
  Remove the Barriers  \n\n\nHigher education in this country is largely for those
  who have the means.  If \nthose who have the means coincided entirely with those
  persons who have the \ntalent we should not be squandering a part of our higher
  education on those\nundeserving of it, nor neglecting great talent among those who
  fail to attend\ncollege for economic reasons.  There are talented individuals in
  every \nsegment of the population, but with few exceptions those without the means\nof
  buying higher education go without it.  Here is a tremendous waste of the\ngreatest
  resource of a nation - the intelligence of its citizens.\n\n\nIf ability, and not
  the circumstance of family fortune, is made to determine\nwho shall receive higher
  education in science, then we shall be assured of\nconstantly improving quality
  at every level of scientific activity.\n\n\n The Generation in Uniform Must Not
  Be Lost  \n\n\nWe have a serious deficit in scientific personnel partly because
  the men \nwho would have studied science in the colleges and universities have been
  \nserving in the Armed Forces.  Many had begun their studies before they went\nto
  war.  Others with capacity for scientific education went to war after \nfinishing
  high school.  The most immediate prospect of making up some of the\ndeficit in scientific
  personnel is by salvaging scientific talent from the \ngeneration in uniform.  For
  even if we should start now to train the current \ncrop of high school graduates,
  it would be 1951 before they would complete \ngraduate studies and be prepared for
  effective scientific research.  This \nfact underlines the necessity of salvaging
  potential scientists in uniform.\n\n\nThe Armed Services should comb their records
  for men who, prior to or during\nthe war, have given evidence of talent for science,
  and make prompt \narrangements, consistent with current discharge plans, for ordering
  those who\nremain in uniform as soon as militarily possible to duty at institutions\nhere
  and overseas where they can continue their scientific education.  \nMoreover, they
  should see that those who study overseas have the benefit of\nthe latest scientific
  developments.\n\n\n A Program  \n\n\nThe country may be proud of the fact that 95
  percent of boys and girls of\nthe fifth grade age are enrolled in school, but the
  drop in enrollment after\nthe fifth grade is less satisfying.  For every 1,000 students
  in the fifth\ngrade, 600 are lost to education before the end of high school, and
  all but\n72 have ceased formal education before completion of college.  While we
  are\nconcerned primarily with methods of selecting and educating high school\ngraduates
  at the college and higher levels, we cannot be complacent about the\nloss of potential
  talent which is inherent in the present situation.\n\n\nStudents drop out of school,
  college, and graduate school, or do not get that\nfar, for a variety of reasons:
  \ they cannot afford to go on; schools and \ncolleges providing courses equal to
  their capacity are not available locally;\nbusiness and industry recruit many of
  the most promising before they have\nfinished the training of which they are capable.
  \ These reasons apply with\nparticular force to science:  the road is long and expensive;
  it extends at\nleast 6 years beyond high school; the percentage of science students
  who can\nobtain first-rate training in institutions near home is small.\n\n\nImprovement
  in the teaching of science is imperative; for students of latent\nscientific ability
  are particularly vulnerable to high school teaching which\nfails to awaken interest
  or to provide adequate instruction.  To enlarge the\ngroup of specially qualified
  men and women it is necessary to increase the \nnumber who go to college.  This
  involves improved high school instruction,\nprovision for helping individual talented
  students to finish high school \n(primarily the responsibility of the local communities),
  and opportunities for\nmore capable, promising high school students to go to college.
  \ Anything\nshort of this means serious waste of higher education and neglect of
  human\nresources.\n\n\nTo encourage and enable a larger number of young men and
  women of ability to\ntake up science as a career, and in order gradually to reduce
  the deficit of\ntrained scientific personnel, it is recommended that provision be
  made for a\nreasonable number of (a) undergraduate scholarships and graduate fellowships\nand
  (b) fellowships for advanced training and fundamental research.  The\ndetails should
  be worked out with reference to the interests of the several\nStates and of the
  universities and colleges; and care should be taken not to\nimpair the freedom of
  the institutions and individuals concerned.\n\n\nThe program proposed by the Moe
  Committee in Appendix 4 would provide 24,000\nundergraduate scholarships and 900
  graduate fellowships and would cost about\n$30,000,000 annually when in full operation.
  \ Each year under this program\n6,000 undergraduate scholarships would be made available
  to high school \ngraduates, and 300 graduate fellowships would be offered to college
  graduates.\nApproximately the scale of allowances provided for under the educational\nprogram
  for returning veterans has been used in estimating the cost of this\nprogram.\n\n\nThe
  plan is, further, that all those who receive such scholarships or\nfellowships in
  science should be enrolled in a National Science Reserve and\nbe liable to call
  into the service of the Government, in connection with \nscientific or technical
  work in time of war or other national emergency\ndeclared by Congress or proclaimed
  by the President. Thus, in addition to\nthe general benefits to the nation by reason
  of the addition to its trained\nranks of such a corps of scientific workers, there
  would be a definite benefit\nto the nation in having these scientific workers on
  call in national \nemergencies.  The Government would be well advised to invest
  the money \ninvolved in this plan even if the benefits to the nation were thought
  of\nsolely - which they are not - in terms of national preparedness.\n\n\n\n\n\n
  Chapter 5 A PROBLEM OF SCIENTIFIC RECONVERSION  \n\n Effects of Mobilization of
  Science for War  \n\n\nWe have been living on our fat. For more than 5 years many
  of our\nscientists have been fighting the war in the laboratories, in\nthe factories
  and shops, and at the front. We have been directing\nthe energies of our scientists
  to the development of weapons and materials\nand methods, on a large number of relatively
  narrow projects initiated and\ncontrolled by the Office of Scientific Research and
  Development and other\nGovernment agencies. Like troops, the scientists have been
  mobilized,\nand thrown into action to serve their country in time of emergency.\nBut
  they have been diverted to a greater extent than is generally\nappreciated from
  the search for answers to the fundamental problems -\nfrom the search on which human
  welfare and progress depends. This\nis not a complaint - it is a fact. The mobilization
  of science\nbehind the lines is aiding the fighting men at the front to\nwin the
  war and to shorten it; and it has resulted incidentally\nin the accumulation of
  a vast amount of experience and knowledge of\nthe application of science to particular
  problems, much of which\ncan be put to use when the war is over. Fortunately, this
  country\nhad the scientists - and the time - to make this contribution and thus\nto
  advance the date of victory.\n\n\n\n\n Security Restrictions Should Be Lifted Promptly
  \ \n\n\nMuch of the information and experience acquired during the war is confined\nto
  the agencies that gathered it. Except to the extent that military security\ndictates
  otherwise, such knowledge should be spread upon the record for\nthe benefit of the
  general public.\n\n\nThanks to the wise provision of the Secretary of War and the
  Secretary\nof the Navy, most of the results of war-time medical research have\nbeen
  published. Several hundred articles have appeared in the professional\njournals;
  many are in process of publication. The material still subject\nto security classification
  should be released as soon as possible.\n\n\nIt is my view that most of the remainder
  of the classified scientific material\nshould be released as soon as there is ground
  for belief that the\nenemy will not be able to turn it against us in this war. Most
  of the\ninformation needed by industry and in education can be released without\ndisclosing
  its embodiments in actual military material and devices.\nBasically there is no
  reason to believe that scientists of other countries\nwill not in time rediscover
  everything we now know which is held in\nsecrecy. A broad dissemination of scientific
  information upon which further\nadvances can readily be made furnishes a sounder
  foundation for our national\nsecurity than a policy of restriction which would impede
  our own progress\nalthough imposed in the hope that possible enemies would not catch
  up with us.\n\n\nDuring the war it has been necessary for selected groups of scientists\nto
  work on specialized problems, with relatively little information as\nto what other
  groups were doing and had done. Working against time,\nthe Office of Scientific
  Research and Development has been\nobliged to enforce this practice during the war,
  although it was\nrealized by all concerned that it was an emergency measure which\nprevented
  the continuous cross-fertilization so essential to fruitful\nscientific effort.\n\n\n\nOur
  ability to overcome possible future enemies depends upon scientific\nadvances which
  will proceed more rapidly with diffusion of knowledge\nthan under a policy of continued
  restriction of knowledge now\nin our possession.\n\n\n\n\n Need for Coordination
  \ \n\n\nIn planning the release of scientific data and experience collected\nin
  connection with the war, we must not overlook the fact that\nresearch has gone forward
  under many auspices - the Army, the Navy,\nthe Office of Scientific Research and
  Development, the National\nAdvisory Committee for Aeronautics, other departments
  and agencies\nof the Government, educational institutions, and many industrial\norganizations.
  There have been numerous cases of independent\ndiscovery of the same truth in different
  places. To permit the release\nof information by one agency and to continue to restrict
  it elsewhere\nwould be unfair in its effect and would tend to impair the morale
  and\nefficiency of scientists who have submerged individual interests\nin the controls
  and restrictions of war.\n\n\nA part of the information now classified which should
  be released\nis possessed jointly by our allies and ourselves. Plans for release\nof
  such information should be coordinated with our allies to minimize\ndanger of international
  friction which would result from sporadic\nuncontrolled release.\n\n\n\n A Board
  to Control Release  \n\n\nThe agency responsible for recommending the release of
  information from\nmilitary classification should be an Army, Navy, civilian body,\nwell
  grounded in science and technology. It should be competent\nto advise the Secretary
  of War and the Secretary of the Navy. It\nshould, moreover, have sufficient recognition
  to secure prompt and\npractical decisions.\n\n\n\nTo satisfy these considerations
  I recommend the establishment of\na Board, made up equally of scientists and military
  men, whose\nfunction would be to pass upon the declassification and to control\nthe
  release for publication of scientific information which is now classified.\n\n\n\n\n
  Publication Should Be Encouraged  \n\n\nThe release of information from security
  regulations is but\none phase of the problem. The other is to provide for\npreparation
  of the material and its publication in a form and at a price which\nwill facilitate
  dissemination and use. In the case of the Office\nof Scientific Research and Development,
  arrangements have been\nmade for the preparation of manuscripts, while the staffs
  under our control\nare still assembled and in possession of the records, as soon
  as the\npressure for production of results for this war has begun to relax.\n\n\nWe
  should get this scientific material to scientists everywhere with great\npromptness,
  and at as low a price as is consistent with suitable\nformat. We should also get
  it to the men studying overseas so that\nthey will know what has happened in their
  absence.\n\n\nIt is recommended that measures which will encourage and facilitate\nthe
  preparation and publication of reports be adopted forthwith\nby all agencies, governmental
  and private, possessing scientific\ninformation released from security control.\n\n\n\n\n\n
  Chapter 6 THE MEANS TO THE END  \n\n New Responsibilities for Government  \n\n\nOne
  lesson is clear from the reports of the several committees\nattached as appendices.
  The Federal Government should accept new\nresponsibilities for promoting the creation
  of new scientific\nknowledge and the development of scientific talent in our youth.\n\n\nThe
  extent and nature of these new responsibilities are set\nforth in detail in the
  reports of the committees whose recommendations\nin this regard are fully endorsed.\n\n\nIn
  discharging these responsibilities Federal funds should be made\navailable. We have
  given much thought to the question of how plans for\nthe use of Federal funds may
  be arranged so that such funds will not drive\nout of the picture funds from local
  governments, foundations, and\nprivate donors. We believe that our proposals will
  minimize that\neffect, but we do not think that it can be completely avoided. We\nsubmit,
  however, that the nation's need for more and better scientific\nresearch is such
  that the risk must be accepted.\n\n\nIt is also clear that the effective discharge
  of these responsibilities\nwill require the full attention of some over-all agency
  devoted\nto that purpose. There should be a focal point within the Government\nfor
  a concerted program of assisting scientific research conducted\noutside of Government.
  Such an agency should furnish the funds needed\nto support basic research in the
  colleges and universities, should\ncoordinate where possible research programs on
  matters of utmost\nimportance to the national welfare, should formulate a national
  policy\nfor the Government toward science, should sponsor the interchange of\nscientific
  information among scientists and laboratories both in\nthis country and abroad,
  and should ensure that the incentives to\nresearch in industry and the universities
  are maintained. All of the\ncommittees advising on these matters agree on the necessity
  for\nsuch an agency.\n\n\n\n The Mechanism  \n\n\nThere are within Government departments
  many groups whose interests are\nprimarily those of scientific research. Notable
  examples are found\nwithin the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Interior, and
  the\nFederal Security Agency. These groups are concerned with science as\ncollateral
  and peripheral to the major problems of those Departments.\nThese groups should
  remain where they are, and continue to perform\ntheir present functions, including
  the support of agricultural\nresearch by grants to the Land Grant Colleges and Experiment
  Stations,\nsince their largest contribution lies in applying fundamental\nknowledge
  to the special problems of the Departments within which\nthey are established.\n\n\nBy
  the same token these groups cannot be made the repository of\nthe new and large
  responsibilities in science which belong to the\nGovernment and which the Government
  should accept. The recommendations\nin this report which relate to research within
  the Government, to the\nrelease of scientific information, to clarification of the
  tax laws,\nand to the recovery and development of our scientific talent now\nin
  uniform can be implemented by action within the existing\nstructure of the Government.
  But nowhere in the Governmental structure\nreceiving its funds from Congress is
  there an agency adapted to\nsupplementing the support of basic research in the universities,\nboth
  in medicine and the natural sciences; adapted to supporting\nresearch on new weapons
  for both Services; or adapted to\nadministering a program of science scholarships
  and fellowships.\n\n\nA new agency should be established, therefore, by the Congress\nfor
  the purpose. Such an agency, moreover, should be an independent\nagency devoted
  to the support of scientific research and advanced\nscientific education alone.
  Industry learned many years ago that basic\nresearch cannot often be fruitfully
  conducted as an adjunct\nto or a subdivision of an operating agency or department.
  Operating\nagencies have immediate operating goals and are under constant\npressure
  to produce in a tangible way, for that is the test of their\nvalue. None of these
  conditions is favorable to basic research.\nresearch is the exploration of the unknown
  and is necessarily\nspeculative. It is inhibited by conventional approaches, traditions,\nand
  standards. It cannot be satisfactorily conducted in an\natmosphere where it is gauged
  and tested by operating or production\nstandards. Basic scientific research should
  not, therefore, be\nplaced under an operating agency whose paramount concern is
  anything\nother than research. Research will always suffer when put in\ncompetition
  with operations. The decision that there should be a\nnew and independent agency
  was reached by each of the committees\nadvising in these matters.\n\n\nI am convinced
  that these new functions should be centered in one agency.\nScience is fundamentally
  a unitary thing. The number of independent\nagencies should be kept to a minimum.
  Much medical progress,\nfor example, will come from fundamental advances in chemistry.\nSeparation
  of the sciences in tight compartments, as would occur\nif more than one agency were
  involved, would retard and not\nadvance scientific knowledge as a whole.\n\n\n\n
  Five Fundamentals  \n\n\nThere are certain basic principles which must underlie
  the program\nof Government support for scientific research and education if\nsuch
  support is to be effective and if it is to avoid impairing\nthe very things we seek
  to foster. These principles are as\nfollows:\n\n\n(1) Whatever the extent of support
  may be, there must be stability of\nfunds over a period of years so that long-range
  programs may be undertaken.\n(2) The agency to administer such funds should be composed
  of citizens\nselected only on the basis of their interest in and capacity to\npromote
  the work of the agency. They should be persons of broad interest\nin and understanding
  of the peculiarities of scientific research and\neducation.\n(3) The agency should
  promote research through contracts or grants\nto organizations outside the Federal
  Government. It should not operate\nany laboratories of its own.\n(4) Support of
  basic research in the public and private colleges,\nuniversities, and research institutes
  must leave the internal\ncontrol of policy, personnel, and the method and scope
  of the research\nto the institutions themselves. This is of the utmost importance.\n(5)
  While assuring complete independence and freedom for the nature,\nscope, and methodology
  of research carried on in the institutions\nreceiving public funds, and while retaining
  discretion in the allocation\nof funds among such institutions, the Foundation proposed
  herein\nmust be responsible to the President and the Congress. Only through such\nresponsibility
  can we maintain the proper relationship between\nscience and other aspects of a
  democratic system. The usual controls\nof audits, reports, budgeting, and the like,
  should, of course, apply\nto the administrative and fiscal operations of the Foundation,
  subject,\nhowever, to such adjustments in procedure as are necessary to meet\nthe
  special requirements of research.\n\n\nBasic research is a long-term process - it
  ceases to be basic if immediate\nresults are expected on short-term support. Methods
  should therefore\nbe found which will permit the agency to make commitments of funds\nfrom
  current appropriations for programs of five years duration or\nlonger. Continuity
  and stability of the program and its support may\nbe expected (a) from the growing
  realization by the Congress of\nthe benefits to the public from scientific research,
  and (b) from\nthe conviction which will grow among those who conduct research under
  the\nauspices of the agency that good quality work will be followed by\ncontinuing
  support.\n\n\n\n Military Research  \n\n\nAs stated earlier in this report, military
  preparedness requires a\npermanent, independent, civilian-controlled organization,
  having close\nliaison with the Army and Navy, but with funds direct from Congress\nand
  the clear power to initiate military research which will\nsupplement and strengthen
  that carried on directly under the control\nof the Army and Navy. As a temporary
  measure the National Academy\nof Sciences has established the Research Board for
  National Security\nat the request of the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the
  Navy.\nThis is highly desirable in order that there may be no interruption\nin the
  relations between scientists and military men after the emergency\nwartime Office
  of Scientific Research and Development goes out\nof existence. The Congress is now
  considering legislation to provide\nfunds for this Board by direct appropriation.\n\n\nI
  believe that, as a permanent measure, it would be appropriate to\nadd to the agency
  needed to perform the other functions recommended\nin this report the responsibilities
  for civilian-initiated and\ncivilian-controlled military research. The function
  of such a\ncivilian group would be primarily to conduct long-range scientific\nresearch
  on military problems - leaving to the Services research\non the improvement of existing
  weapons.\n\n\nSome research on military problems should be conducted, in time of\npeace
  as well as in war, by civilians independently of the\nmilitary establishment. It
  is the primary responsibility of the\nArmy and Navy to train the men, make available
  the weapons, and\nemploy the strategy that will bring victory in combat. The Armed\nServices
  cannot be expected to be experts in all of the complicated\nfields which make it
  possible for a great nation to fight successfully\nin total war. There are certain
  kinds of research - such as\nresearch on the improvement of existing weapons - which
  can\nbest be done within the military establishment. However, the job\nof long-range
  research involving application of the newest\nscientific discoveries to military
  needs should be the responsibility\nof those civilian scientists in the universities
  and in industry\nwho are best trained to discharge it thoroughly and successfully.
  It is\nessential that both kinds of research go forward and that\nthere be the closest
  liaison between the two groups.\n\n\nPlacing the civilian military research function
  in the proposed agency\nwould bring it into close relationship with a broad program\nof
  basic research in both the natural sciences and medicine. A\nbalance between military
  and other research could thus readily\nbe maintained.\n\n\nThe establishment of
  the new agency, including a civilian military\nresearch group, should not be delayed
  by the existence of\nthe Research Board for National Security, which is a temporary\nmeasure.
  Nor should the creation of the new agency be delayed\nby uncertainties in regard
  to the postwar organization of our\nmilitary departments themselves. Clearly, the
  new agency, including\na civilian military research group within it, can remain
  sufficiently\nflexible to adapt its operations to whatever may be the final\norganization
  of the military departments.\n\n\n\n National Research Foundation  \n\n\nIt is my
  judgment that the national interest in scientific research\nand scientific education
  can best be promoted by the creation of a\nNational Research Foundation.\n\n\nI.
  Purposes. - The National Research Foundation should develop\nand promote a national
  policy for scientific research and\nscientific education, should support basic research
  in nonprofit\norganizations, should develop scientific talent in American youth
  by\nmeans of scholarships and fellowships, and should by contract\nand otherwise
  support long-range research on military matters.\n\n\nII. Members. - 1. Responsibility
  to the people, through the President\nand Congress, should be placed in the hands
  of, say nine\nMembers, who should be persons not otherwise connected with the\nGovernment
  and not representative of any special interest, who\nshould be known as National
  Research Foundation Members, selected\nby the President on the basis of their interest
  in and capacity\nto promote the purposes of the Foundation.\n\n\n2. The terms of
  the Members should be, say, 4 years, and no\nMember should be eligible for immediate
  reappointment provided\nhe has served a full 4-year term. It should be arranged
  that\nthe Members first appointed serve terms of such length that at least\ntwo
  Members are appointed each succeeding year.\n\n\n3. The Members should serve without
  compensation but should be\nentitled to their expenses incurred in the performance
  of their\nduties.\n\n\n4. The Members should elect their own chairman annually.\n\n\n5.
  The chief executive officer of the Foundation should be a\ndirector appointed by
  the Members. Subject to the direction and\nsupervision of the Foundation Members
  (acting as a board), the\ndirector should discharge all the fiscal, legal, and administrative\nfunctions
  of the Foundation. The director should receive a\nsalary that is fully adequate
  to attract an outstanding man to the post.\n\n\n6. There should be an administrative
  office responsible to the\ndirector to handle in one place the fiscal, legal, personnel,
  and\nother similar administrative functions necessary to the accomplishment\nof
  the purposes of the Foundation.\n\n\n7. With the exception of the director, the
  division members, and\none executive officer appointed by the director to administer\nthe
  affairs of each division, all employees of the Foundation should\nbe appointed under
  Civil Service regulations.\n\n\n\nIII. Organization. - 1. In order to accomplish
  the purposes of the Foundation\nthe Members should establish several professional
  Divisions to\nbe responsible to the Members. At the outset these Divisions should
  be:\n\n\na. Division of Medical Research. - The function of this Division should\nbe
  to support medical research.\n\n\nb. Division of Natural Sciences. - The function
  of this Division should\nbe to support research in the physical and natural sciences.\n\n\nc.
  Division of National Defense. - It should be the function of this\nDivision to support
  long-range scientific research on military matters.\n\n\nd. Division of Scientific
  Personnel and Education. - It should be the function\nof this Division to support
  and to supervise the grant of scholarships and\nfellowships in science.\n\n\ne.
  Division of Publications and Scientific Collaboration. - This Division\nshould be
  charged with encouraging the publication of scientific knowledge\nand promoting
  international exchange of scientific information.\n\n\n2. Each Division of the Foundation
  should be made up of at least\nfive members, appointed by the Members of the Foundation.
  In making such\nappointments the Members should request and consider recommendations
  from\nthe National Academy of Sciences which should be asked to establish a\nnew
  National Research Foundation nominating committee in order to bring together\nthe
  recommendations of scientists in all organizations. The chairman of each\nDivision
  should be appointed by the Members of the Foundation.\n\n\n3. The division Members
  should be appointed for such terms as the Members\nof the Foundation may determine,
  and may be reappointed at the discretion\nof the Members. They should receive their
  expenses and compensation for their\nservices at a per diem rate of, say, $50 while
  engaged on business of\nthe Foundation, but no division member should receive more
  than, say,\n$10,000 compensation per year.\n\n\n4. Membership of the Division of
  National Defense should include, in\naddition to, say, five civilian members, one
  representative designated\nby the Secretary of War, and one representative of the
  Secretary of the\nNavy, who should serve without additional compensation for this
  duty.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n

  Functions. - 1. The Members of the Foundation should have the following\nfunctions,
  powers, and duties:\n\n\na. To formulate over-all policies of the Foundation.\n\n\nb.
  To establish and maintain such offices within the United States,\nits territories
  and possessions, as they may deem necessary.\n\n\nc. To meet and function at any
  place within the United States, its\nterritories and possessions.\n\n\nd. To obtain
  and utilize the services of other Government agencies\nto the extent that such agencies
  are prepared to render such services.\n\n\ne. To adopt, promulgate, amend, and rescind
  rules and regulations\nto carry out the provisions of the legislation and the policies\nand
  practices of the Foundation.\n\n\nf. To review and balance the financial requirements
  of the several Divisions\nand to propose to the President the annual estimate for
  the\nfunds required by each Division. Appropriations should be earmarked\nfor the
  purposes of specific Divisions, but the Foundation should\nbe left discretion with
  respect to the expenditure of each Division's\nfunds.\n\n\ng. To make contracts
  or grants for the conduct of research by negotiation\nwithout advertising for bids.\n\n\nAnd
  with the advice of the National Research Foundation Divisions\nconcerned -\n\n\nh.

  or national, as in their judgment will aid in\neffectuating the purposes of the
  legislation, and to pay the\nexpenses thereof.\n\n\ni. To enter into contracts with
  or make grants to educational and\nnonprofit research institutions for support of
  scientific research.\n\n\nj. To initiate and finance in appropriate agencies, institutions,\nor
  organizations, research on problems related to the national defense.\n\n\nk. To
  initiate and finance in appropriate organizations research projects\nfor which existing
  facilities are unavailable or inadequate.\n\n\nl. To establish scholarships and
  fellowships in the natural sciences\nincluding biology and medicine.\n\n\nm. To
  promote the dissemination of scientific and technical information\nand to further
  its international exchange.\n\n\nn. To support international cooperation in science
  by providing financial\naid for international meetings, associations of scientific
  societies,\nand scientific research programs organized on an international basis.\n\n\no.
  To devise and promote the use of methods of improving the transition\nbetween research
  and its practical application in industry.\n\n\n\n2. The Divisions should be responsible
  to the Members of the Foundation\nfor - \n\n\na. Formulation of programs and policy
  within the scope of the particular\nDivisions.\n\n\nb. Recommendations regarding
  the allocation of research programs\namong research organizations.\n\n\nc. Recommendation
  of appropriate arrangements between the Foundation\nand the organizations selected
  to carry on the program.\n\n\nd. Recommendation of arrangements with State and local
  authorities\nin regard to cooperation in a program of science scholarships\nand
  fellowships.\n\n\ne. Periodic review of the quality of research being conducted
  under\nthe auspices of the particular Division and revision of the program\nof support
  of research.\n\n\nf. Presentation of budgets of financial needs for the work of
  the Division.\n\n\ng. Maintaining liaison with other scientific research agencies,
  both\ngovernmental and private, concerned with the work of the Division.\n\n\n\nV.
  Patent Policy. - The success of the National Research Foundation\nin promoting scientific
  research in this country will depend to a very\nlarge degree upon the cooperation
  of organizations outside the\nGovernment. In making contracts with or grants to
  such organizations\nthe Foundation should protect the public interest adequately
  and at\nthe same time leave the cooperating organization with adequate freedom\nand
  incentive to conduct scientific research. The public interest will\nnormally be
  adequately protected if the Government receives a royalty-free\nlicense for governmental
  purposes under any patents resulting from work\nfinanced by the Foundation. There
  should be no obligation on the research\ninstitution to patent discoveries made
  as a result of support from the\nFoundation. There should certainly not be any absolute
  requirement that\nall rights in such discoveries be assigned to the Government,
  but it should\nbe left to the discretion of the director and the interested Division\nwhether
  in special cases the public interest requires such an assignment.\nLegislation on
  this point should leave to the Members of the\nFoundation discretion as to its patent
  policy in order that patent arrangements\nmay be adjusted as circumstances and the
  public interest require.\n\n\n\nVI. Special Authority. - In order to insure that
  men of great competence\nand experience may be designated as Members of the Foundation
  and as members\nof the several professional Divisions, the legislation creating\nthe
  Foundation should contain specific authorization so that the Members\nof the Foundation
  and the Members of the Divisions may also engage\nin private and gainful employment,
  notwithstanding the provisions\nof any other laws: provided, however, that no compensation
  for such\nemployment is received in any form from any profit-making institution\nwhich
  receives funds under contract, or otherwise, from the Division or\nDivisions of
  the Foundation with which the individual is concerned.\nIn normal times, in view
  of the restrictive statutory prohibitions\nagainst dual interests on the part of
  Government officials, it would\nbe virtually impossible to persuade persons having
  private employment\nof any kind to serve the Government in an official capacity.
  In order,\nhowever, to secure the part-time services of the most competent\nmen
  as Members of the Foundation and the Divisions, these stringent\nprohibitions should
  be relaxed to the extent indicated.\n\n\nSince research is unlike the procurement
  of standardized items, which\nare susceptible to competitive bidding on fixed specifications,
  the\nlegislation creating the National Research Foundation should free the\nFoundation
  from the obligation to place its contracts for research through\nadvertising for
  bids. This is particularly so since the measure of\na successful research contract
  lies not in the dollar cost but in\nthe qualitative and quantitative contribution
  which is made to\nour knowledge. The extent of this contribution in turn depends
  on\nthe creative spirit and talent which can be brought to bear within a\nresearch
  laboratory. The National Research Foundation must, therefore, be\nfree to place
  its research contracts or grants not only with those\ninstitutions which have a
  demonstrated research capacity but also with\nother institutions whose latent talent
  or creative atmosphere affords\npromise of research success.\n\n\nAs in the case
  of the research sponsored during the war by the Office\nof Scientific Research and
  Development, the research sponsored by\nthe National Research Foundation should
  be conducted, in general,\non an actual cost basis without profit to the institution
  receiving\nthe research contract or grant.\n\n\nThere is one other matter which
  requires special mention. Since research does\nnot fall within the category of normal
  commercial or procurement\noperations which are easily covered by the usual contractual
  relations,\nit is essential that certain statutory and regulatory fiscal\nrequirements
  be waived in the case of research contractors. For example,\nthe National Research
  Foundation should be authorized by legislation\nto make, modify, or amend contracts
  of all kinds with or without\nlegal consideration, and without performance bonds.
  Similarly, advance\npayments should be allowed in the discretion of the Director\nof
  the Foundation when required. Finally, the normal vouchering requirements\nof the
  General Accounting Office with respect to detailed itemization or\nsubstantiation
  of vouchers submitted under cost contracts should be\nrelaxed for research contractors.
  Adherence to the usual procedures\nin the case of research contracts will impair
  the efficiency of research\noperations and will needlessly increase the cost of
  the work of the\nGovernment. Without the broad authority along these lines which
  was\ncontained in the First War Powers Act and its implementing Executive\nOrders,
  together with the special relaxation of vouchering requirements\ngranted by the
  General Accounting Office, the Office of Scientific\nResearch and Development would
  have been gravely handicapped in carrying\non research on military matters during
  this war. Colleges and universities\nin which research will be conducted principally
  under contract with the\nFoundation are, unlike commercial institutions, not equipped
  to handle\nthe detailed vouchering procedures and auditing technicalities which\nare
  required of the usual Government contractors.\n\n\n\n\nVII. Budget. - Studies by
  the several committees provide a partial\nbasis for making an estimate of the order
  of magnitude of\nthe funds required to implement the proposed program. Clearly the
  program\nshould grow in a healthy manner from modest beginnings. The following\nvery
  rough estimates are given for the first year of operation after the\nFoundation
  is organized and operating, and for the fifth year of operation\nwhen it is expected
  that the operations would have reached a fairly\nstable level:\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n

  Action by Congress  \n\nThe National Research Foundation herein proposed meets the
  urgent need\nof the days ahead. The form of the organization suggested is the\nresult
  of considerable deliberation. The form is important. The very\nsuccessful pattern
  of organization of the National Advisory Committee\nfor Aeronautics, which has promoted
  basic research on problems of flight\nduring the past thirty years, has been carefully
  considered in proposing\nthe method of appointment of Members of the Foundation
  and in defining\ntheir responsibilities. Moreover, whatever program is established
  it\nis vitally important that it satisfy the Five Fundamentals.\n\nThe Foundation
  here proposed has been described only in outline. The\nexcellent reports of the
  committees which studied these matters are\nattached as appendices. They will be
  of aid in furnishing detailed\nsuggestions.\n\nLegislation is necessary. It should
  be drafted with great care. Early\naction is imperative, however, if this nation
  is to meet the\nchallenge of science and fully utilize the potentialities of science.
  On\nthe wisdom with which we bring science to bear against the problems\nof the
  coming years depends in large measure our future as a nation.\n  In a letter dated
  November 17, 1944, President Roosevelt requested my \nrecommendations on the following
  points:\n\n  (1) What can be done, consistent with military security, and with the
  prior\napproval of the military authorities, to make known to the world as soon
  as\npossible the contributions which have been made during our war effort to\nscientific
  knowledge?\n\n  (2) With particular reference to the war of science against disease,
  what\ncan be done now to organize a program for continuing in the future the work\nwhich
  has been done in medicine and related sciences?\n\n  (3) What can the Government
  do now and in the future to aid research \nactivities by public and private organizations?\n\n
  \ (4) Can an effective program be proposed for discovering and developing\nscientific
  talent in American youth so that the continuing future of scientific\nresearch in
  this country may be assured on a level comparable to what has \nbeen done during
  the war?\n\n  It is clear from President Roosevelt's letter that in speaking of
  science\nthat he had in mind the natural sciences, including biology and medicine,\nand
  I have so interpreted his questions.  Progress in other fields, such \nas the social
  sciences and the humanities, is likewise important; but the\nprogram for science
  presented in my report warrants immediate attention.\n\n  In seeking answers to
  President Roosevelt's questions I have had the \nassistance of distinguished committees
  specially qualified to advise in \nrespect to these subjects.  The committees have
  given these matters the\nserious attention they deserve; indeed, they have regarded
  this as an \nopportunity to participate in shaping the policy of the country with
  reference\nto scientific research.  They have had many meetings and have submitted
  formal\nreports.  I have been in close touch with the work of the committees and
  \nwith their members throughout.  I have examined all of the data they assembled\nand
  the suggestions they submitted on the points raised in President Roosevelt's\nletter.\n\n
  \ Although the report which I submit herewith is my own, the facts, conclusions,\nand
  recommendations are based on the findings of the committees which have\nstudied
  these questions.  Since my report is necessarily brief, I am including\nas appendices
  the full reports of the committees.\n\n  A single mechanism for implementing the
  recommendations of the several\ncommittees is essential.  In proposing such a mechanism
  I have departed somewhat\nfrom the specific recommendations of the committees, but
  I have since been\nassured that the plan I am proposing is fully acceptable to the
  committee\nmembers.\n\n  The pioneer spirit is still vigorous within this nation.
  \ Science offers a \nlargely unexplored hinterland for the pioneer who has the tools
  for his task.\nThe rewards of such exploration both for the Nation and the individual
  are\ngreat.  Scientific progress is one essential key to our security as a nation,\nto
  our better health, to more jobs, to a higher standard of living, and to\nour cultural
  progress.\n\n  There is, however, no reason why the lessons to be found in this
  experiment\ncannot be profitably employed in times of peace.  The information, the
  \ntechniques, and the research experience developed by the Office of Scientific\nResearch
  and Development and by the thousands of scientists in the universities\nand in private
  industry, should be used in the days of peace ahead for the \nimprovement of the
  national health, the creation of new enterprises bringing\nnew jobs, and the betterment
  of the national standard of living.\n\n  It is with that objective in mind that
  I would like to have your \nrecommendations on the following four major points:\n\n
  \ First: What can be done, consistent with military security, and with the prior\napproval
  of the military authorities, to make known to the world as soon as\npossible the
  contributions which have been made during our war effort to\nscientific knowledge?\n\n
  \ The diffusion of such knowledge should help us stimulate new enterprises,\nprovide
  jobs four our returning servicemen and other workers, and make possible\ngreat strides
  for the improvement of the national well-being.\n\n  Second: With particular reference
  to the war of science against disease, what\ncan be done now to organize a program
  for continuing in the future the work\nwhich has been done in medicine and related
  sciences?\n\n  The fact that the annual deaths in this country from one or two diseases\nalone
  are far in excess of the total number of lives lost by us in battle\nduring this
  war should make us conscious of the duty we owe future generations.\n\n  Third:
  What can the Government do now and in the future to aid research\nactivities by
  public and private organizations?  The proper roles of public \nand of private research,
  and their interrelation, should be carefully \nconsidered.\n\n  Fourth: Can an effective
  program be proposed for discovering and developing\nscientific talent in American
  youth so that the continuing future of scientific\nresearch in this country may
  be assured on a level comparable to what has\nbeen done during the war?\n\n  New
  frontiers of the mind are before us, and if they are pioneered with the\nsame vision,
  boldness, and drive with which we have waged this war we can\ncreate a fuller and
  more fruitful employment and a fuller and more fruitful\nlife.\n\n  I hope that,
  after such consultation as you may deem advisable with your\nassociates and others,
  you can let me have your considered judgment on these\nmatters as soon as convenient
  - reporting on each when you are ready, rather\nthan waiting for completion of your
  studies in all.\n\n\n\n\"New frontiers of the mind are before us, and if they are
  pioneered with the\nsame vision, boldness, and drive with which we have waged this
  war we can\ncreate a fuller and more fruitful employment and a fuller and more fruitful\nlife.\"--\n\n\n
  \ Progress in the war against disease depends upon a flow of new scientific\nknowledge.
  \ New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous\nadditions to knowledge
  of the laws of nature, and the application of that\nknowledge to practical purposes.
  \ Similarly, our defense against aggression\ndemands new knowledge so that we can
  develop new and improved weapons.  This\nessential, new knowledge can be obtained
  only through basic scientific \nresearch.\n\n  Science can be effective in the national
  welfare only as a member of a team,\nwhether the conditions be peace or war.   But
  without scientific progress no\namount of achievement in other directions can insure
  our health, prosperity,\nand security as a nation in the modern world.\n\n\n\n \n
  \ We have taken great strides in the war against disease.  The death rate for\nall
  diseases in the Army, including overseas forces, has been reduced from 14.1\nper
  thousand in the last war to 0.6 per thousand in this war.  In the last\n40 years
  life expectancy has increased from 49 to 65 years, largely as a \nconsequence of
  the reduction in the death rates of infants and children.  But\nwe are far from
  the goal.  The annual deaths from one or two diseases far\nexceed the total number
  of American lives lost in battle during this war.\nA large fraction of these deaths
  in our civilian population cut short the \nuseful lives of our citizens.  Approximately
  7,000,000 persons in the United\nStates are mentally ill and their care costs the
  public over $175,000,000 a\nyear.  Clearly much illness remains for which adequate
  means of prevention and\ncure are not yet known.\n\n  The responsibility for basic
  research in medicine and the underlying sciences,\nso essential to progress in the
  war against disease, falls primarily upon\nthe medical schools and universities.
  \ Yet we find that the traditional\nsources of support for medical research in the
  medical schools and universities,\nlargely endowment income, foundation grants,
  and private donations, are \ndiminishing and there is no immediate prospect of a
  change in this trend.  \nMeanwhile, the cost of medical research has been rising.
  \ If we are to maintain\nthe progress in medicine which has marked the last 25 years,
  the Government\nshould extend financial support to basic medical research in the
  medical\nschools and in universities.\n\n\n\n  The bitter and dangerous battle against
  the U-boat was a battle of\nscientific techniques - and our margin of success was
  dangerously small.\nThe new eyes which radar has supplied can sometimes be blinded
  by\nnew scientific developments. V-2 was countered only by capture of\nthe launching
  sites.\n\n\n  We cannot again rely on our allies to hold off the enemy while we\nstruggle
  to catch up. There must be more - and more adequate - military\nresearch in peacetime.
  It is essential that the civilian scientists\ncontinue in peacetime some portion
  of those contributions to national\nsecurity which they have made so effectively
  during the war. This\ncan best be done through a civilian-controlled organization
  with close\nliaison with the Army and Navy, but with funds direct from Congress,
  and\nthe clear power to initiate military research which will supplement and\nstrengthen
  that carried on directly under the control of the Army and\nNavy.\n\n\n\nOne of
  our hopes is that after the war there will be full employment.\nTo reach that goal
  the full creative and productive energies of the American\npeople must be released.
  To create more jobs we must make new and better\nand cheaper products. We want plenty
  of new, vigorous enterprises. But new\nproducts and processes are not born full-grown.
  They are founded on new\nprinciples and new conceptions which in turn result from
  basic scientific\nresearch. Basic scientific research is scientific capital. Moreover,
  we\ncannot any longer depend upon Europe as a major source of this scientific\ncapital.
  Clearly, more and better scientific research is one essential to the\nachievement
  of our goal of full employment.\n\n\nHow do we increase this scientific capital?
  First, we must have plenty\nof men and women trained in science, for upon them depends
  both the\ncreation of new knowledge and its application to practical purposes. Second,\nwe
  must strengthen the centers of basic research which are principally the\ncolleges,
  universities, and research institutes. These institutions provide\nthe environment
  which is most conducive to the creation of new scientific\nknowledge and least under
  pressure for immediate, tangible results. With\nsome notable exceptions, most research
  in industry and Government involves\napplication of existing scientific knowledge
  to practical problems. It is\nonly the colleges, universities, and a few research
  institutes that devote\nmost of their research efforts to expanding the frontiers
  of knowledge.\n\n\nExpenditures for scientific research by industry and Government
  increased from\n$140,000,000 in 1930 to $309,000,000 in 1940. Those for the colleges
  and\nuniversities increased from $20,000,000 to $31,000,000, while those for the\nresearch
  institutes declined from $5,200,000 to $4,500,000 during the same\nperiod. If the
  colleges, universities, and research institutes are to meet\nthe rapidly increasing
  demands of industry and Government for new\nscientific knowledge, their basic research
  should be strengthened by use\nof public funds.\n\n\nFor science to serve as a powerful
  factor in our national welfare, applied\nresearch both in Government and in industry
  must be vigorous. To improve\nthe quality of scientific research within the Government,
  steps should be\ntaken to modify the procedures for recruiting, classifying, and
  compensating\nscientific personnel in order to reduce the present handicap of governmental\nscientific
  bureaus in competing with industry and the universities for\ntop-grade scientific
  talent. To provide coordination of the common\nscientific activities of these governmental
  agencies as to policies and\nbudgets, a permanent Science Advisory Board should
  be created to advise\nthe executive and legislative branches of Government on these
  matters.\n\n\nThe most important ways in which the Government can promote industrial\nresearch
  are to increase the flow of new scientific knowledge through support\nof basic research,
  and to aid in the development of scientific talent.\nIn addition, the Government
  should provide suitable incentives to industry\nto conduct research, (a) by clarification
  of present uncertainties\nin the Internal Revenue Code in regard to the deductibility
  of research\nand development expenditures as current charges against net income,
  and\n(b) by strengthening the patent system so as to eliminate uncertainties\nwhich
  now bear heavily on small industries and so as to prevent abuses\nwhich reflect
  discredit upon a basically sound system. In addition, ways\nshould be found to cause
  the benefits of basic research to reach industries\nwhich do not now utilize new
  scientific knowledge.\n\n\n\n\nThe responsibility for the creation of new scientific
  knowledge - and for most\nof its application - rests on that small body of men and
  women who\nunderstand the fundamental laws of nature and are skilled in the techniques\nof
  scientific research. We shall have rapid or slow advance on any scientific\nfrontier
  depending on the number of highly qualified and trained scientists\nexploring it.\n\n\nThe
  deficit of science and technology students who, but for the war, would\nhave received
  bachelor's degrees is about 150,000. It is estimated that\nthe deficit of those
  obtaining advanced degrees in these fields will amount\nin 1955 to about 17,000
  - for it takes at least 6 years from college entry\nto achieve a doctor's degree
  or its equivalent in science or engineering.\nThe real ceiling on our productivity
  of new scientific knowledge and its\napplication in the war against disease, and
  the development of new\nproducts and new industries, is the number of trained scientists
  available.\n\n\nThe training of a scientist is a long and expensive process. Studies
  clearly\nshow that there are talented individuals in every part of the population,\nbut
  with few exceptions, those without the means of buying higher education\ngo without
  it. If ability, and not the circumstance of family fortune,\ndetermines who shall
  receive higher education in science, then we\nshall be assured of constantly improving
  quality at every level of\nscientific activity. The Government should provide a
  reasonable number of\nundergraduate scholarships and graduate fellowships in order
  to develop\nscientific talent in American youth. The plans should be designed to
  attract\ninto science only that proportion of youthful talent appropriate to the\nneeds
  of science in relation to the other needs of the nation for high\nabilities.\n\n\n\n\nThe
  most immediate prospect of making up the deficit in scientific personnel\nis to
  develop the scientific talent in the generation now in uniform. Even\nif we should
  start now to train the current crop of high-school graduates\nnone would complete
  graduate studies before 1951. The Armed Services should\ncomb their records for
  men who, prior to or during the war, have given\nevidence of talent for science,
  and make prompt arrangements, consistent\nwith current discharge plans, for ordering
  those who remain in uniform,\nas soon as militarily possible, to duty at institutions
  here and overseas where\nthey can continue their scientific education. Moreover,
  the Services should\nsee that those who study overseas have the benefit of the latest
  scientific\ninformation resulting from research during the war.\n\n\n\nWhile most
  of the war research has involved the application of\nexisting scientific knowledge
  to the problems of war, rather than basic\nresearch, there has been accumulated
  a vast amount of information\nrelating to the application of science to particular
  problems. Much\nof this can be used by industry. It is also needed for teaching
  in\nthe colleges and universities here and in the Armed Forces Institutes\noverseas.
  Some of this information must remain secret, but most of it\nshould be made public
  as soon as there is ground for belief that the\nenemy will not be able to turn it
  against us in this war. To select that\nportion which should be made public, to
  coordinate its release,\nand definitely to encourage its publication, a Board composed
  of Army,\nNavy, and civilian scientific members should be promptly established.\n\n\n\nThe
  Government should accept new responsibilities for promoting\nthe flow of new scientific
  knowledge and the development of\nscientific talent in our youth. These responsibilities
  are the proper\nconcern of the Government, for they vitally affect our health, our\njobs,
  and our national security. It is in keeping also with basic United\nStates policy
  that the Government should foster the opening of new\nfrontiers and this is the
  modern way to do it. For many years the\nGovernment has wisely supported research
  in the agricultural colleges\nand the benefits have been great. The time has come
  when such support\nshould be extended to other fields.\n\n\nThe effective discharge
  of these new responsibilities will require\nthe full attention of some over-all
  agency devoted to that purpose. There\nis not now in the permanent Governmental
  structure receiving its funds\nfrom Congress an agency adapted to supplementing
  the support of basic\nresearch in the colleges, universities, and research institutes,\nboth
  in medicine and the natural sciences, adapted to supporting research\non new weapons
  for both Services, or adapted to administering a program\nof science scholarships
  and fellowships.\n\n\nTherefore I recommend that a new agency for these purposes
  be established.\nSuch an agency should be composed of persons of broad interest
  and\nexperience, having an understanding of the peculiarities of scientific\nresearch
  and scientific education. It should have stability of funds so\nthat long-range
  programs may be undertaken. It should recognize\nthat freedom of inquiry must be
  preserved and should leave internal\ncontrol of policy, personnel, and the method
  and scope of research to\nthe institutions in which it is carried on. It should
  be fully\nresponsible to the President and through him to the Congress for\nits
  program.\n\n\nEarly action on these recommendations is imperative if this nation\nis
  to meet the challenge of science in the crucial years ahead. On the\nwisdom with
  which we bring science to bear in the war against disease,\nin the creation of new
  industries, and in the strengthening of our\nArmed Forces depends in large measure
  our future as a nation.\n\n\n\nWe all know how much the new drug, penicillin, has
  meant to our grievously\nwounded men on the grim battlefronts of this war - the
  countless lives it\nhas saved - the incalculable suffering which its use has prevented.
  Science\nand the great practical genius of this nation made this achievement possible.\n\n\nSome
  of us know the vital role which radar has played in bringing the United\nNations
  to victory over Nazi Germany and in driving the Japanese steadily\nback from their
  island bastions. Again it was painstaking scientific research\nover many years that
  made radar possible.\n\n\nWhat we often forget are the millions of pay envelopes
  on a peacetime Saturday \nnight which are filled because new products and new industries
  have provided\njobs for countless Americans.  Science made that possible, too.\n\n\nIn
  1939 millions of people were employed in industries which did not even\nexist at
  the close of the last war - radio, air conditioning, rayon and other\nsynthetic
  fibers, and plastics are examples of the products of these industries.\nBut these
  things do not mark the end of progress - they are but the beginning\nif we make
  full use of our scientific resources.  New manufacturing industries\ncan be started
  and many older industries greatly strengthened and expanded if\nwe continue to study
  nature's laws and apply new knowledge to practical \npurposes.\n\n\nGreat advances
  in agriculture are also based upon scientific research.  Plants\nwhich are more
  resistant to disease and are adapted to short growing season,\nthe prevention and
  cure of livestock diseases, the control of our insect\nenemies, better fertilizers,
  and improved agricultural practices, all stem\nfrom painstaking scientific research.\n\n\nAdvances
  in science when put to practical use mean more jobs, higher wages,\nshorter hours,
  more abundant crops, more leisure for recreation, for study,\nfor learning how to
  live without the deadening drudgery which has been the\nburden of the common man
  for ages past.  Advances in science will also \nbring higher standards of living,
  will lead to the prevention or cure of \ndiseases, will promote conservation of
  our limited national resources, and\nwill assure means of defense against aggression.
  \ But to achieve these \nobjectives - to secure a high level of employment, to maintain
  a position\nof world leadership - the flow of new scientific knowledge must be both
  \ncontinuous and substantial.\n\n\nOur population increased from 75 million to 130
  million between 1900 and\n1940. In some countries comparable increases have been
  accompanied by\nfamine. In this country the increase has been accompanied by\nmore
  abundant food supply, better living, more leisure, longer life, and\nbetter health.
  This is, largely, the product of three factors - the free play of\ninitiative of
  a vigorous people under democracy, the heritage of great\nnational wealth, and the
  advance of science and its application.\n\n\nScience, by itself, provides no panacea
  for individual, social, and economic\nills. It can be effective in the national
  welfare only as a member of a team,\nwhether the conditions be peace or war. But
  without scientific progress\nno amount of achievement in other directions can insure
  our health,\nprosperity, and security as a nation in the modern world.\n\n\n\n\nIt
  has been basic United States policy that Government should foster the\nopening of
  new frontiers. It opened the seas to clipper ships and\nfurnished land for pioneers.
  Although these frontiers have more or less\ndisappeared, the frontier of science
  remains. It is in keeping with the\nAmerican tradition - one which has made the
  United States great -\nthat new frontiers shall be made accessible for development
  by\nall American citizens.\n\n\nMoreover, since health, well-being, and security
  are proper concerns of\nGovernment, scientific progress is, and must be, of vital
  interest\nto Government. Without scientific progress the national health would\ndeteriorate;
  without scientific progress we could not hope for\nimprovement in our standard of
  living or for an increased number of jobs\nfor our citizens; and without scientific
  progress we could not have maintained\nour liberties against tyranny.\n\n\n\n\nFrom
  early days the Government has taken an active interest in scientific\nmatters. During
  the nineteenth century the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the\nNaval Observatory, the
  Department of Agriculture, and the Geological\nSurvey were established. Through
  the Land Grant College acts the\nGovernment has supported research in state institutions
  for more than 80 years\non a gradually increasing scale. Since 1900 a large number
  of scientific\nagencies have been established within the Federal Government, until
  in 1939\nthey numbered more than 40.\n\n\nMuch of the scientific research done by
  Government agencies is intermediate\nin character between the two types of work
  commonly referred to as\nbasic and applied research. Almost all Government scientific
  work has\nultimate practical objectives but, in many fields of broad national concern,\nit
  commonly involves long-term investigation of a fundamental nature.\nGenerally speaking,
  the scientific agencies of Government are not so\nconcerned with immediate practical
  objectives as are the laboratories\nof industry nor, on the other hand, are they
  as free to explore any\nnatural phenomena without regard to possible economic applications
  as\nare the educational and private research institutions. Government scientific\nagencies
  have splendid records of achievement, but they are limited\nin function.\n\n\nWe
  have no national policy for science. The Government has only begun\nto utilize science
  in the nation's welfare. There is no body within the\nGovernment charged with formulating
  or executing a national science\npolicy. There are no standing committees of the
  Congress devoted to\nthis important subject. Science has been in the wings. It should
  be brought to\nthe center of the stage - for in it lies much of our hope for the
  future.\n\n\nThere are areas of science in which the public interest is acute but
  which\nare likely to be cultivated inadequately if left without more support than\nwill
  come from private sources. These areas - such as research on military\nproblems,
  agriculture, housing, public health, certain medical research,\nand research involving
  expensive capital facilities beyond the capacity\nof private institutions - should
  be advanced by active Government support.\nTo date, with the exception of the intensive
  war research conducted by\nthe Office of Scientific Research and Development, such
  support has been\nmeager and intermittent.\n\n\nFor reasons presented in this report
  we are entering a period when science\nneeds and deserves increased support from
  public funds.\n\n\n\n\nThe publicly and privately supported colleges, universities,
  and research\ninstitutes are the centers of basic research. They are the wellsprings
  of\nknowledge and understanding. As long as they are vigorous and healthy\nand their
  scientists are free to pursue the truth wherever it may\nlead, there will be a flow
  of new scientific knowledge to those who can apply\nit to practical problems in
  Government, in industry, or elsewhere.\n\n\nMany of the lessons learned in the war-time
  application of science under\nGovernment can be profitably applied in peace. The
  Government is peculiarly\nfitted to perform certain functions, such as the coordination
  and support of\nbroad programs on problems of great national importance. But we
  must proceed\nwith caution in carrying over the methods which work in wartime to
  the\nvery different conditions of peace. We must remove the rigid controls\nwhich
  we have had to impose, and recover freedom of inquiry and that healthy\ncompetitive
  scientific spirit so necessary for expansion of the frontiers\nof scientific knowledge.\n\n\nScientific
  progress on a broad front results from the free play of free\nintellects, working
  on subjects of their own choice, in the manner dictated\nby their curiosity for
  exploration of the unknown. Freedom of inquiry\nmust be preserved under any plan
  for Government support of science\nin accordance with the Five Fundamentals listed
  on\n page 26 .\n\n\nThe study of the momentous questions presented in President
  Roosevelt's\nletter has been made by able committees working diligently. This report\npresents
  conclusions and recommendations based upon the studies of\nthese committees which
  appear in full as the appendices. Only in the\ncreation of one over-all mechanism
  rather than several does this report\ndepart from the specific recommendations of
  the committees. The members of\nthe committees have reviewed the recommendations
  in regard to the single\nmechanism and have found this plan thoroughly acceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe
  death rate for all diseases in the Army, including the overseas forces,\nhas been
  reduced from 14.1 per thousand in the last war to 0.6 per thousand\nin this war.
  \n\n\nSuch ravaging diseases as yellow fever, dysentery, typhus, tetanus, pneumonia,\nand
  meningitis have been all but conquered by penicillin and the sulfa drugs,\nthe insecticide
  DDT, better vaccines, and improved hygenic measures.  Malaria\nhas been controlled.
  \ There has been dramatic progress in surgery.\n\n\nThe striking advances in medicine
  during the war have been possible only because\nwe had a large backlog of scientific
  data accumulated through basic research\nin many scientific fields in the years
  before the war.\n\n\n\nIn the last 40 years life expectancy in the United States
  has increased from\n49 to 65 years largely as a consequence of the reduction in
  the death rates of\ninfants and children; in the last 20 years the death rate from
  the diseases\nof childhood has been reduced 87 percent.\n\n\nDiabetes has been brought
  under control by insulin, pernicious anemia by\nliver extracts; and the once widespread
  deficiency diseases have been much\nreduced, even in the lowest income groups, by
  accessory food factors and\nimprovement of diet.  Notable advances have been made
  in the early diagnosis\nof cancer, and in the surgical and radiation treatment of
  the disease.\n\n\nThese results have been achieved through a great amount of basic
  research \nin medicine and the preclinical sciences, and by the dissemination of
  this\nnew scientific knowledge through the physicians and medical services and\npublic
  health agencies of the country.  In this cooperative endeavour the\npharmaceutical
  industry has played an important role, especially during the\nwar.  All of the medical
  and public health groups share credit for these\nachievements; they form interdependent
  members of a team.\n\n\nProgress in combating disease depends upon an expanding
  body of new scientific\nknowledge.\n\n\n\nAs President Roosevelt observed, the annual
  deaths from one or two diseases\nare far in excess of the total number of American
  lives lost in battle during\nthis war.  A large fraction of these deaths in our
  civilian population cut\nshort the useful lives of our citizens.  This is our present
  position despite\nthe fact that in the last three decades notable progress has been
  made in \ncivilian medicine.  The reduction in death rate from diseases of childhood\nhas
  shifted the emphasis to the middle and old age groups, particularly to\nthe malignant
  diseases and the degenerative processes prominent in later\nlife.  Cardiovascular
  disease, including chronic disease of the kidneys,\narteriosclerosis, and cerebral
  hemorrhage, now account for 45 percent of the\ndeaths in the United States.  Second
  are the infectious diseases, and third\nis cancer.  Added to these are many maladies
  (for example, the common cold,\narthritis, asthma and hay fever, peptic ulcer) which,
  through infrequently\nfatal, cause incalculable disability.\n\n\nAnother aspect
  of the changing emphasis is the increase of mental diseases.\nApproximately 7 million
  persons in the United States are mentally ill; more\nthan one-third of the hospital
  beds are occupied by such persons, at a cost\nof $175 million a year.  Each year
  125,000 new mental cases are hospitalized.\n\n\nNotwithstanding great progress in
  prolonging the span of life and relief\nof suffering, much illness remains for which
  adequate means of prevention\nand cure are not yet known.  While additional physicians,
  hospitals, and \nhealth programs are needed, their full usefulness cannot be attained
  unless\nwe enlarge our knowledge of the human organism and the nature of disease.\nAny
  extension of medical facilities must be accompanied by an expanded program\nof medical
  training and research.\n\n\n\nDiscoveries pertinent to medical progress have often
  come from remote and\nunexpected sources, and it is certain that this will be true
  in the future.\nIt is wholly probable that progress in the treatment of cardiovascular\ndisease,
  renal disease, cancer, and similar refractory diseases will be\nmade as the result
  of fundamental discoveries in subjects unrelated to those\ndiseases, and perhaps
  entirely unexpected by the investigator.  Further progress\nrequires that the entire
  front of medicine and the underlying sciences of \nchemistry, physics, anatomy,
  biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology,\nbacteriology, pathology, parasitology,
  etc., be broadly developed.\n\n\nProgress in the war against disease results from
  discoveries in remote and\nunexpected fields of medicine and the underlying sciences.\n\n\n\nPenicillin
  reached our troops in time to save countless lives because the \nGovernment coordinated
  and supported the program of research and development\non the drug.  The development
  moved from the early laboratory stage to large\nscale production and use in a fraction
  of the time it would have taken without\nsuch leadership.  The search for better
  anti-malarials, which proceeded at a\nmoderate tempo for many years, has been accelerated
  enormously by Government\nsupport during the war.  Other examples can be cited in
  which medical progress\nhas been similarly advanced.  In achieving these results,
  the Government has\nprovided over-all coordination and support; it has not dictated
  how the work\nshould be done within any cooperating institution.\n\n\nDiscovery
  of new therapeutic agents and methods usually results from basic\nstudies in medicine
  and the underlying sciences.  The development of such\nmaterials and methods to
  the point at which they become available to\nmedical practitioners requires teamwork
  involving the medical schools, the\nscience departments of universities, Government
  and the pharmaceutical\nindustry.  Government initiative, support, and coordination
  can be very\neffective in this development phase.\n\n\nGovernment initiative and
  support for the development of newly discovered\ntherapeutic materials and methods
  can reduce the time required to bring the\nbenefits to the public.\n\n\n\nThe primary
  place for medical research is in the medical schools and \nuniversities.  In some
  cases coordinated direct attack on special problems\nmay be made by teams of investigators,
  supplementing similar attacks carried\non by the Army, Navy, Public Health Service,
  and other organizations.  Apart\nfrom teaching, however, the primary obligation
  of the medical schools and \nuniversities is to continue the traditional function
  of such institutions, \nnamely,  to provide the individual worker with an opportunity
  for free,\nuntrammeled study of nature, in the directions and by the methods suggested\nby
  his interests, curiosity, and imagination.  The history of medical science\nteaches
  clearly the supreme importance of affording the prepared mind complete\nfreedom
  for the exercise of initiative.  It is the special province of the \nmedical schools
  and universities to foster medical research in this way - a duty\nwhich cannot be
  shifted to government agencies, industrial organizations, or\nto any other institutions.\n\n\nWhere
  clinical investigations of the human body are required, the medical \nschools are
  in a unique position, because of their close relationship to \nteaching hospitals,
  to integrate such investigations with the work of the\ndepartments of preclinical
  science, and to impart new knowledge to physicians\nin training.  At the same time,
  the teaching hospitals are especially well\nqualified to carry on medical research
  because of their close connection with\nthe medical schools, on which they depend
  for staff and supervision.\n\n\nBetween World War I and World War II the United
  States overtook all other \nnations in medical research and assumed a position of
  world leadership. To\na considerable extent this progress reflected the liberal
  financial support\nfrom university endowment income, gifts from individuals, and
  foundation \ngrants in the 20's.  The growth of research departments in medical
  schools\nahs been very uneven, however, and in consequence most of the important
  work\nhas been done in a few large schools.  This should be corrected by building
  up\nthe weaker institutions, especially in regions which now have no strong medical\nresearch
  activities.  \n\n\nThe traditional sources of support for medical research, largely
  endowment\nincome, foundation grants, and private donations, are diminishing, and
  there is\nno immediate prospect of a change in this trend.  Meanwhile, research
  costs have\nsteadily risen.  More elaborate and expensive equipment is required,
  supplies\nare more costly, and the wages of assistants are higher.  Industry is
  only to\na limited extent a source of funds for basic medical research.\n\n\nIt
  is clear that if we are to maintain the progress in medicine which has\nmarked the
  last 25 years, the Government should extend financial support to\nbasic medical
  research in the medical schools and in the universities, through\ngrants both for
  research and for fellowships.  The amount which can be \neffectively spent in the
  first year should not exceed 5 million dollars.\nAfter a program is under way perhaps
  20 million dollars a year can be spent\neffectively.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn this war
  it has become clear beyond all doubt that scientific research is\nabsolutely essential
  to national security.  The bitter and dangerous battle\nagainst the U-boat was a
  battle of scientific techniques - and our margin of\nsuccess was dangerously small.
  \ The new eyes which radar supplied to our\nfighting forces quickly evoked the development
  of scientific countermeasures\nwhich could often blind them. This again represents
  the ever continuing battle\nof techniques.  The V-1 attack on London was finally
  defeated by three devices\ndeveloped during this war and used superbly in the field.
  \ V-2 was countered\nonly by the capture of the launching sites.\n\n\nThe Secretaries
  of War and Navy recently stated in a joint letter to the\nNational Academy of Sciences:\n\n\nThis
  war emphasizes three facts of supreme importance to national security:\n(1) Powerful
  new tactics of defense and offense are developed around new\nweapons created by
  scientific and engineering research; (2) the competitive\ntime element in developing
  those weapons and tactics may be decisive; (3) war\nis increasingly total war, in
  which the armed services must be supplemented by\nactive participation of every
  element of civilian population.\n\n\nTo insure continued preparedness along farsighted
  technical lines, the research\nscientists of the country must be called upon to
  continue in peacetime some\nsubstantial portion of those types of contribution to
  national security which\nthey have made so effectively during the stress of the
  present war * * *.\n\n\nThere must be more - and more adequate - military research
  during peacetime.\nWe cannot again rely on our allies to hold off the enemy while
  we struggle\nto catch up.  Further, it is clear that only the Government can undertake\nmilitary
  research; for it must be carried on in secret, much of it has no\ncommercial value,
  and it is expensive.  The obligation of Government to support\nresearch on military
  problems is inescapable.\n\n\nModern war requires the use of the most advanced scientific
  techniques.  Many\nof the leaders in the development of radar are scientists who
  before the war\nhad been exploring the nucleus of the atom.  While there must be
  increased\nemphasis on science in the future training of officers for both the Army
  and\nNavy, such men cannot be expected to be specialists in scientific research.\nTherefore
  a professional partnership between the officers in the Services\nand civilian scientists
  is needed.\n\n\nThe Army and Navy should continue to carry on research and development
  on the\nimprovement of current weapons.  For many years the National Advisory Committee\nfor
  Aeronautics has supplemented the work of the Army and Navy by conducting\nbasic
  research on the problems of flight.  There should now be permanent \ncivilian activity
  to supplement the research work of the Services in other\nscientific fields so as
  to carry on in time of peace some part of the \nactivities of the emergency war-time
  Office of Scientific Research and \nDevelopment.\n\n\nMilitary preparedness requires
  a permanent independent, civilian-controlled\norganization, having close liaison
  with the Army and Navy, but with funds\ndirectly from Congress and with the clear
  power to initiate military research\nwhich will supplement and strengthen that carried
  on directly under the control\nof the Army and Navy.\n\n\nMilitary preparedness
  requires a permanent independent, civilian-controlled\norganization, having close
  liaison with the Army and Navy, but with funds\ndirectly from Congress and with
  the clear power to initiate military research\nwhich will supplement and strengthen
  that carried on directly under the control\nof the Army and Navy.\n\n\n\nOne of
  our hopes is that after the war there will be full employment, and \nthat the production
  of goods and services will serve to raise our standard\nof living.  We do not know
  yet how we shall reach that goal, but it is certain\nthat it can be achieved only
  by releasing the full creative and productive\nenergies of the American people.
  \n\n\nSurely we will not get there by standing still, merely by making the same\nthings
  we made before and selling them at the same or higher prices.  We\nwill not get
  ahead in international trade unless we offer new and more \nattractive and cheaper
  products. \n\n\nWhere will these new products come from?  How will we find ways
  to make better\nproducts at lower cost?  The answer is clear.  There must be a stream
  of new\nscientific knowledge to turn the wheels of private and public enterprise.
  \ There\nmust be plenty of men and women trained in science and technology for upon\nthem
  depend both the creation of new knowledge and its application to practical\npurposes.\n\n\nMore
  and better scientific research is essential to the achievement of our\ngoal of full
  employment.\n\n\n\nBasic research is performed without thought of practical ends.
  \ It results\nin general knowledge and an understanding of nature and its laws.
  \ This \ngeneral knowledge provides the means of answering a large number of important\npractical
  problems, though it may not give a complete specific answer to any\none of them.
  \ The function of applied research is to provide such complete\nanswers.  The scientist
  doing basic research may not be at all interested in\nthe practical applications
  of his work, yet the further progress of industrial\ndevelopment would eventually
  stagnate if basic scientific research were long\nneglected. \n\n\nOne of the peculiarities
  of basic science is the variety of paths which lead\nto productive advance.  Many
  of the most important discoveries have come as\na result of experiments undertaken
  with very different purposes in mind.  \nStatistically it is certain that important
  and highly useful discoveries will\nresult from some fraction of the undertakings
  in basic science; but the results\nof any one particular investigation cannot be
  predicted with accuracy.\n\n\nBasic research leads to new knowledge.  It provides
  scientific capital.  It\ncreates the fund from which the practical applications
  of knowledge must be\ndrawn.  New products and new processes do not appear full-grown.
  \ They are\nfounded on new principles and new conceptions, which in turn are painstakingly\ndeveloped
  by research in the purest realms of science.\n\n\nToday, it is truer than ever that
  basic research is the pacemaker of\ntechnological progress.  In the nineteenth century,
  Yankee mechanical ingenuity,\nbuilding largely upon the basic discoveries of European
  scientists, could \ngreatly advance the technical arts.  Now the situation is different.\n\n\nA
  nation which depends upon others for its new basic scientific knowledge\nwill be
  slow in its industrial progress and weak in its competitive position\nin world trade,
  regardless of its mechanical skill.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublicly and privately supported
  colleges and universities and\nthe endowed research institutes must furnish both
  the new scientific\nknowledge and the trained research workers. These institutions
  are uniquely\nqualified by tradition and by their special characteristics to carry\non
  basic research. They are charged with the responsibility of conserving\nthe knowledge
  accumulated by the past, imparting that knowledge to\nstudents, and contributing
  new knowledge of all kinds. It is chiefly in\nthese institutions that scientists
  may work in an atmosphere which is\nrelatively free from the adverse pressure of
  convention, prejudice,\nor commercial necessity. At their best they provide the
  scientific\nworker with a strong sense of solidarity and security, as well as a\nsubstantial
  degree of personal intellectual freedom. All of these\nfactors are of great importance
  in the development of new knowledge,\nsince much of new knowledge is certain to
  arouse opposition because\nof its tendency to challenge current beliefs or practice.\n\n\nIndustry
  is generally inhibited by preconceived goals, by its own clearly\ndefined standards,
  and by the constant pressure of commercial necessity.\nSatisfactory progress in
  basic science seldom occurs under conditions\nprevailing in the normal industrial
  laboratory. There are some notable\nexceptions, it is true, but even in such cases
  it is rarely possible\nto match the universities in respect to the freedom which
  is so important\nto scientific discovery.\n\n\nTo serve effectively as the centers
  of basic research these institutions\nmust be strong and healthy. They must attract
  our best scientists as\nteachers and investigators. They must offer research opportunities
  and\nsufficient compensation to enable them to compete with industry and\ngovernment
  for the cream of scientific talent.\n\n\nDuring the past 25 years there has been
  a great increase in industrial\nresearch involving the application of scientific
  knowledge to a\nmultitude of practical purposes - thus providing new products, new\nindustries,
  new investment opportunities, and millions of jobs.\nDuring the same period research
  within Government - again largely\napplied research - has also been greatly expanded.
  In the decade\nfrom 1930 to 1940 expenditures for industrial research increased
  from\n$116,000,000 to $240,000,000 and those for scientific research in\nGovernment
  rose from $24,000,000 to $69,000,000. During the same\nperiod expenditures for scientific
  research in the colleges and\nuniversities increased from $20,000,000 to $31,000,000,
  while those\nin the endowed research institutes declined from $5,200,000 to\n$4,500,000.
  These are the best estimates available. The figures\nhave been taken from a variety
  of sources and arbitrary definitions\nhave necessarily been applied, but it is believed
  that they may be\naccepted as indicating the following trends:\n\n\n\nIf the colleges,
  universities, and research institutes are to meet the rapidly\nincreasing demands
  of industry and Government for new scientific knowledge,\ntheir basic research should
  be strengthened by use of public funds.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough there are some notable
  exceptions, most research\nconducted within governmental laboratories is of an applied
  nature.\nThis has always been true and is likely to remain so. Hence\nGovernment,
  like industry, is dependent on the colleges, universities,\nand research institutes
  to expand the basic scientific frontiers and\nto furnish trained scientific investigators.\n\n\nResearch
  within the Government represents an important part of our\ntotal research activity
  and needs to be strengthened and expanded\nafter the war. Such expansion should
  be directed to fields of inquiry and\nservice which are of public importance and
  are not adequately carried\non by private organizations.\n\n\nThe most important
  single factor in scientific and technical work is\nthe quality of the personnel
  employed. The procedures currently\nfollowed within the Government for recruiting,
  classifying and compensating\nsuch personnel place the Government under a severe
  handicap in competing\nwith industry and the universities for first-class scientific
  talent. Steps\nshould be taken to reduce that handicap.\n\n\nIn the Government the
  arrangement whereby the numerous scientific\nagencies form parts of larger departments
  has both advantages\nand disadvantages. but the present pattern is firmly established
  and\nthere is much to be said for it. There is, however, a very real need for\nsome
  measure of coordination of the common scientific activities of\nthese agencies,
  both as to policies and budgets, and at present no such\nmeans exist.\n\n\n\nA permanent
  Science Advisory Board should be created to consult with\nthese scientific bureaus
  and to advise the executive and legislative\nbranches of Government as to the policies
  and budgets of Government\nagencies engaged in scientific research.\n\n\nThis board
  should be composed of disinterested scientists who have no\nconnection with the
  affairs of any Government agency.\n\n\n\n\nThe simplest and most effective way in
  which the Government can\nstrengthen industrial research is to support basic research
  and to\ndevelop scientific talent.\n\n\nThe benefits of basic research do not reach
  all industries equally or at\nthe same speed. Some small enterprises never receive
  any of the\nbenefits. It has been suggested that the benefits might be better utilized\nif
  \"research clinics\" for such enterprises were to be established. Businessmen\nwould
  thus be able to make more use of research than they now do. This\nproposal is certainly
  worthy of further study.\n\n\nOne of the most important factors affecting the amount
  of industrial\nresearch is the income-tax law. Government action in respect to this\nsubject
  will affect the rate of technical progress in industry.\nUncertainties as to the
  attitude of the Bureau of Internal Revenue\nregarding the deduction of research
  and development expenses are\na deterrent to research expenditure. These uncertainties
  arise from\nlack of clarity of the tax law as to the proper treatment of such costs.\n\n\n\nThe
  Internal Revenue Code should be amended to remove present\nuncertainties in regard
  to the deductibility of research and development\nexpenditures as current charges
  against net income.\n\n\n\nResearch is also affected by the patent laws. They stimulate
  new invention\nand they make it possible for new industries to be built around new\ndevices
  or new processes. These industries generate new jobs and new\nproducts, all of which
  contribute to the welfare and the strength of the\ncountry.\n\n\nYet, uncertainties
  in the operation of the patent laws have\nimpaired the ability of small industries
  to translate new ideas into\nprocesses and products of value to the nation. These
  uncertainties\nare, in part, attributable to the difficulties and expense incident\nto
  the operation of the patent system as it presently exists. These\nuncertainties
  are also attributable to the existence of certain\nabuses, which have appeared in
  the use of patents. The abuses should\nbe corrected. They have led to extravagantly
  critical attacks which tend\nto discredit a basically sound system.\n\n\nIt is important
  that the patent system continue to serve the country\nin the manner intended by
  the Constitution, for it has been a vital\nelement in the industrial vigor which
  has distinguished this nation.\n\n\nThe National Patent Planning Commission has
  reported on this subject.\nIn addition, a detailed study, with recommendations concerning\nthe
  extent to which modifications should be made in our patent laws\nis currently being
  made under the leadership of the Secretary of Commerce.\nIt is recommended, therefore,
  that specific action with regard to the\npatent laws be withheld pending the submission
  of the report devoted\nexclusively to that subject.\n\n\n\nInternational exchange
  of scientific information is of growing importance.\nIncreasing specialization of
  science will make it more important\nthan ever that scientists in this country keep
  continually ahead of\ndevelopments abroad. In addition a flow of scientific information
  constitutes\none facet of general international accord which should be cultivated.\n\n\nThe
  Government can accomplish significant results in several ways: by aiding\nin the
  arrangement of international science congresses, in the\nofficial accrediting of
  American scientists to such gatherings, in the\nofficial reception of foreign scientists
  of standing in this country,\nin making possible a rapid flow of technical information,
  including\ntranslation service, and possibly in the provision of international\nfellowships.
  Private foundations and other groups partially fulfill some of\nthese functions
  at present, but their scope is incomplete and inadequate.\n\n\n\nThe Government
  should take an active role in promoting the international\nflow of scientific information.\n\n\n\nWe
  can no longer count on ravaged Europe as a source of fundamental knowledge.\nIn
  the past we have devoted much of our best efforts to the application of \nsuch knowledge
  which has been discovered abroad.  In the future we must pay\nincreased attention
  to discovering this knowledge for ourselves particularly\nsince the scientific applications
  of the future will be more than ever dependent\nupon such basic knowledge.\n\n\nNew
  impetus must be given to research in our country.   Such impetus can come\npromptly
  only from the Government.  Expenditures for research in the colleges,\nuniversities,
  and research institutes will otherwise not be able to meet the\nadditional demands
  of increased public need for research.\n\n\nFurther, we cannot expect industry adequately
  to fill the gap.  Industry will\nfully rise to the challenge of applying new knowledge
  to new products.  The\ncommercial incentive can be relied upon for that.  But basic
  research is \nessentially noncommercial in nature.  It will not receive the attention
  it\nrequires if left to industry.\n\n\nFor many years the Government has wisely
  supported research in the agricultural\ncolleges and the benefits have been great.
  \ The time has come when such support\nshould be extended to other fields.  \n\n\nIn
  providing government support, however, we must endeavor to preserve as far\nas possible
  the private support of research both in industry and in the \ncolleges, universities,
  and research institutes.  These private sources should\ncontinue to carry their
  share of the financial burden.\n\n\n\nIt is estimated that an adequate program for
  Federal support of basic research\nin the colleges, universities, and research institutes
  and for financing\nimportant applied research in the public interest, will cost
  about 10 million\ndollars at the outset and may rise to about 50 million dollars
  annually when\nfully underway at the end of perhaps 5 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe responsibility
  for the creation of new scientific knowledge rests on \nthat small body of men and
  women who understand the fundamental laws of\nnature and are skilled in the techniques
  of scientific research.  While there\nwill always be the rare individual who will
  rise to the top without benefit\nof formal education and training, he is the exception
  and even he might make \na more notable contribution if he had the benefit of the
  best education we\nhave to offer.  I cannot improve on President Conant's statement
  that:\n\n\n \"* * * in every section of the entire area where the word science may
  properly\nbe applied, the limiting factor is a human one.  We shall have rapid or
  slow\nadvance in this direction or in that depending on the number of really \nfirst-class
  men who are engaged in the work in question.  * * * So in the last\nanalysis, the
  future of science in this country will be determined by our basic\neducational policy.\"\n\n\n\nIt
  would be folly to set up a program under which research in the natural\nsciences
  and medicine was expanded at the cost of the social sciences, \nhumanities, and
  other studies so essential to national well-being.  This point\nhas been well stated
  by the Moe Committee as follows:\n\n\n\" As citizens, as good citizens, we therefore
  think that we must have in \nmind while examining the question before us - the discovery
  and development\nof scientific talent - the needs of the whole national welfare.
  \ We could\nnot suggest to you a program which would syphon into science and technology\na
  disproportionately large share of the nation's highest abilities, without \ndoing
  harm to the nation, nor, indeed, without crippling science.  * * * Science\ncannot
  live by and unto itself alone.\"\n\n\n\"The uses to which high ability in youth
  can be put are various and, to a large\nextent, are determined by social pressures
  and rewards.  When aided by selective\ndevices for picking out scientifically talented
  youth, it is clear that large\nsums of money for scholarships and fellowships and
  monetary and other rewards\nin disproportionate amounts might draw into science
  too large a percentage\nof the nation's high ability, with a result highly detrimental
  to the nation\nand to science.  Plans for the discovery and development of scientific
  talent\nmust be related to the other needs of society for high ability.  * * * There\nis
  never enough ability at high levels to satisfy all the needs of the nation;\nwe
  would not seek to draw into science any more of it than science's \nproportionate
  share.\"\n\n\n\nAmong the young men and women qualified to take up scientific work,
  since 1940\nthere have been few students over 18, except some in medicine and engineering\nin
  Army and Navy programs and a few 4-F's, who have followed an integrated\nscientific
  course of studies.  Neither our allies nor, so far as we know, our\nenemies have
  done anything so radical as thus to suspend almost completely\ntheir educational
  activities in scientific pursuits during the war period.\n\n\nTwo great principles
  have guided us in this country as we have turned our full\nefforts to war.  First,
  the sound democratic principle that there should be no\nfavored classes or special
  privilege in a time of peril, that all should be \nready to sacrifice equally; second,
  \ the tenet that every man should serve in\nthe capacity in which his talents and
  experience can best be applied for the\nprosecution of the war effort.  In general
  we have held these principles well\nin balance.\n\n\nIn my opinion, however, we
  have drawn too heavily for nonscientific purposes\nupon the great natural resource
  which resides in our trained young scientists\nand engineers.  For the general good
  of the country too many such men have gone\ninto uniform, and their talents have
  not always been fully utilized.  With the\nexception of those men engaged in war
  research, all physically fit students\nat graduate level have been taken into the
  armed forces.  Those ready for \ncollege training in the sciences have not been
  permitted to enter upon that\ntraining.\n\n\nThere is thus an accumulating deficit
  of trained research personnel which will\ncontinue for many years.  The deficit
  of science and technology students who,\nbut for the war, would have received bachelor's
  degrees is about 150,000.  The\ndeficit of those holding advanced degrees - that
  is, young scholars trained to\nthe point where they are capable of carrying on original
  work - has been \nestimated as amounting to about 17,000 by 1955 in chemistry, engineering,\ngeology,
  mathematics, physics, psychology, and the biological sciences.\n\n\nWith mounting
  demands for scientists both for teaching and for research, we \nwill enter the post-war
  period with a serious deficit in our trained scientific\npersonnel.\n\n\n\nConfronted
  with these deficits, we are compelled to look to the use of our \nbasic human resources
  and formulate a program which will assure their \nconservation and effective development.
  \ The committee advising me on scientific\npersonnel has stated the following principle
  which should guide our planning:\n\n\n\"If we were all-knowing and all-wise we might,
  but we think probably not, write\nyou a plan whereby there might be selected for
  training, which they otherwise\nwould not get, those who, 20 years hence, would
  be scientific leaders, and we\nmight not bother about any lesser manifestations
  of scientific ability.  But in\nthe present state of knowledge a plan cannot be
  made which will select, and \nassist, only those young men and women who will give
  the top future leadership\nto science.  To get top leadership there must be a relatively
  large base of\nhigh ability selected for development and then successive skimmings
  of the cream\nof ability at successive times and at higher levels.  No one can select
  from\nthe bottom those who will be the leaders at the top because unmeasured and\nunknown
  factors enter into scientific, or any, leadership.  There are brains\nand character,
  strength and health, happiness and spiritual vitality, interest\nand motivation,
  and no one knows what else, that must needs enter into this\nsupra-mathematical
  calculus.\n\n\n\"We think we probably would not, even if we were all-wise and all-knowing,
  write\nyou a plan whereby you would be assured of scientific leadership at one stroke.\nWe
  think as we think because we are not interested in setting up an elect.\nWe think
  it much the best plan, in this constitutional Republic,\nthat opportunity be held
  out to all kinds and conditions of men whereby they\ncan better themselves.  This
  is the American way; this is the way the United\nStates has become what it is.  We
  think it very important that circumstances\nbe such that there be no ceilings, other
  than ability itself, to intellectual\nambition.  We think it very important that
  every boy and girl shall know that,\nif he shows that he has what it takes, the
  sky is the limit.  Even if it be\nshown subsequently that he has not what it takes
  to go to the top, he will go\nfurther than he would otherwise go if there had been
  a ceiling beyond which\nhe always knew he could not aspire.\n\n\n\"By proceeding
  from point to point and taking stock on the way, by giving \nfurther opportunity
  to those who show themselves worthy of further opportunity,\nby giving the most
  opportunity to those who show themselves continually \ndeveloping - this is the
  way we propose.  This is the American way:  a man work\nfor what he gets.\"\n\n\n\nHigher
  education in this country is largely for those who have the means.  If \nthose who
  have the means coincided entirely with those persons who have the \ntalent we should
  not be squandering a part of our higher education on those\nundeserving of it, nor
  neglecting great talent among those who fail to attend\ncollege for economic reasons.
  \ There are talented individuals in every \nsegment of the population, but with
  few exceptions those without the means\nof buying higher education go without it.
  \ Here is a tremendous waste of the\ngreatest resource of a nation - the intelligence
  of its citizens.\n\n\nIf ability, and not the circumstance of family fortune, is
  made to determine\nwho shall receive higher education in science, then we shall
  be assured of\nconstantly improving quality at every level of scientific activity.\n\n\n\nWe
  have a serious deficit in scientific personnel partly because the men \nwho would
  have studied science in the colleges and universities have been \nserving in the
  Armed Forces.  Many had begun their studies before they went\nto war.  Others with
  capacity for scientific education went to war after \nfinishing high school.  The
  most immediate prospect of making up some of the\ndeficit in scientific personnel
  is by salvaging scientific talent from the \ngeneration in uniform.  For even if
  we should start now to train the current \ncrop of high school graduates, it would
  be 1951 before they would complete \ngraduate studies and be prepared for effective
  scientific research.  This \nfact underlines the necessity of salvaging potential
  scientists in uniform.\n\n\nThe Armed Services should comb their records for men
  who, prior to or during\nthe war, have given evidence of talent for science, and
  make prompt \narrangements, consistent with current discharge plans, for ordering
  those who\nremain in uniform as soon as militarily possible to duty at institutions\nhere
  and overseas where they can continue their scientific education.  \nMoreover, they
  should see that those who study overseas have the benefit of\nthe latest scientific
  developments.\n\n\n\nThe country may be proud of the fact that 95 percent of boys
  and girls of\nthe fifth grade age are enrolled in school, but the drop in enrollment
  after\nthe fifth grade is less satisfying.  For every 1,000 students in the fifth\ngrade,
  600 are lost to education before the end of high school, and all but\n72 have ceased
  formal education before completion of college.  While we are\nconcerned primarily
  with methods of selecting and educating high school\ngraduates at the college and
  higher levels, we cannot be complacent about the\nloss of potential talent which
  is inherent in the present situation.\n\n\nStudents drop out of school, college,
  and graduate school, or do not get that\nfar, for a variety of reasons:  they cannot
  afford to go on; schools and \ncolleges providing courses equal to their capacity
  are not available locally;\nbusiness and industry recruit many of the most promising
  before they have\nfinished the training of which they are capable.  These reasons
  apply with\nparticular force to science:  the road is long and expensive; it extends
  at\nleast 6 years beyond high school; the percentage of science students who can\nobtain
  first-rate training in institutions near home is small.\n\n\nImprovement in the
  teaching of science is imperative; for students of latent\nscientific ability are
  particularly vulnerable to high school teaching which\nfails to awaken interest
  or to provide adequate instruction.  To enlarge the\ngroup of specially qualified
  men and women it is necessary to increase the \nnumber who go to college.  This
  involves improved high school instruction,\nprovision for helping individual talented
  students to finish high school \n(primarily the responsibility of the local communities),
  and opportunities for\nmore capable, promising high school students to go to college.
  \ Anything\nshort of this means serious waste of higher education and neglect of
  human\nresources.\n\n\nTo encourage and enable a larger number of young men and
  women of ability to\ntake up science as a career, and in order gradually to reduce
  the deficit of\ntrained scientific personnel, it is recommended that provision be
  made for a\nreasonable number of (a) undergraduate scholarships and graduate fellowships\nand
  (b) fellowships for advanced training and fundamental research.  The\ndetails should
  be worked out with reference to the interests of the several\nStates and of the
  universities and colleges; and care should be taken not to\nimpair the freedom of
  the institutions and individuals concerned.\n\n\nThe program proposed by the Moe
  Committee in Appendix 4 would provide 24,000\nundergraduate scholarships and 900
  graduate fellowships and would cost about\n$30,000,000 annually when in full operation.
  \ Each year under this program\n6,000 undergraduate scholarships would be made available
  to high school \ngraduates, and 300 graduate fellowships would be offered to college
  graduates.\nApproximately the scale of allowances provided for under the educational\nprogram
  for returning veterans has been used in estimating the cost of this\nprogram.\n\n\nThe
  plan is, further, that all those who receive such scholarships or\nfellowships in
  science should be enrolled in a National Science Reserve and\nbe liable to call
  into the service of the Government, in connection with \nscientific or technical
  work in time of war or other national emergency\ndeclared by Congress or proclaimed
  by the President. Thus, in addition to\nthe general benefits to the nation by reason
  of the addition to its trained\nranks of such a corps of scientific workers, there
  would be a definite benefit\nto the nation in having these scientific workers on
  call in national \nemergencies.  The Government would be well advised to invest
  the money \ninvolved in this plan even if the benefits to the nation were thought
  of\nsolely - which they are not - in terms of national preparedness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe
  have been living on our fat. For more than 5 years many of our\nscientists have
  been fighting the war in the laboratories, in\nthe factories and shops, and at the
  front. We have been directing\nthe energies of our scientists to the development
  of weapons and materials\nand methods, on a large number of relatively narrow projects
  initiated and\ncontrolled by the Office of Scientific Research and Development and
  other\nGovernment agencies. Like troops, the scientists have been mobilized,\nand
  thrown into action to serve their country in time of emergency.\nBut they have been
  diverted to a greater extent than is generally\nappreciated from the search for
  answers to the fundamental problems -\nfrom the search on which human welfare and
  progress depends. This\nis not a complaint - it is a fact. The mobilization of science\nbehind
  the lines is aiding the fighting men at the front to\nwin the war and to shorten
  it; and it has resulted incidentally\nin the accumulation of a vast amount of experience
  and knowledge of\nthe application of science to particular problems, much of which\ncan
  be put to use when the war is over. Fortunately, this country\nhad the scientists
  - and the time - to make this contribution and thus\nto advance the date of victory.\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch
  of the information and experience acquired during the war is confined\nto the agencies
  that gathered it. Except to the extent that military security\ndictates otherwise,
  such knowledge should be spread upon the record for\nthe benefit of the general
  public.\n\n\nThanks to the wise provision of the Secretary of War and the Secretary\nof
  the Navy, most of the results of war-time medical research have\nbeen published.
  Several hundred articles have appeared in the professional\njournals; many are in
  process of publication. The material still subject\nto security classification should
  be released as soon as possible.\n\n\nIt is my view that most of the remainder of
  the classified scientific material\nshould be released as soon as there is ground
  for belief that the\nenemy will not be able to turn it against us in this war. Most
  of the\ninformation needed by industry and in education can be released without\ndisclosing
  its embodiments in actual military material and devices.\nBasically there is no
  reason to believe that scientists of other countries\nwill not in time rediscover
  everything we now know which is held in\nsecrecy. A broad dissemination of scientific
  information upon which further\nadvances can readily be made furnishes a sounder
  foundation for our national\nsecurity than a policy of restriction which would impede
  our own progress\nalthough imposed in the hope that possible enemies would not catch
  up with us.\n\n\nDuring the war it has been necessary for selected groups of scientists\nto
  work on specialized problems, with relatively little information as\nto what other
  groups were doing and had done. Working against time,\nthe Office of Scientific
  Research and Development has been\nobliged to enforce this practice during the war,
  although it was\nrealized by all concerned that it was an emergency measure which\nprevented
  the continuous cross-fertilization so essential to fruitful\nscientific effort.\n\n\n\nOur
  ability to overcome possible future enemies depends upon scientific\nadvances which
  will proceed more rapidly with diffusion of knowledge\nthan under a policy of continued
  restriction of knowledge now\nin our possession.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn planning the release
  of scientific data and experience collected\nin connection with the war, we must
  not overlook the fact that\nresearch has gone forward under many auspices - the
  Army, the Navy,\nthe Office of Scientific Research and Development, the National\nAdvisory
  Committee for Aeronautics, other departments and agencies\nof the Government, educational
  institutions, and many industrial\norganizations. There have been numerous cases
  of independent\ndiscovery of the same truth in different places. To permit the release\nof
  information by one agency and to continue to restrict it elsewhere\nwould be unfair
  in its effect and would tend to impair the morale and\nefficiency of scientists
  who have submerged individual interests\nin the controls and restrictions of war.\n\n\nA
  part of the information now classified which should be released\nis possessed jointly
  by our allies and ourselves. Plans for release\nof such information should be coordinated
  with our allies to minimize\ndanger of international friction which would result
  from sporadic\nuncontrolled release.\n\n\n\n\nThe agency responsible for recommending
  the release of information from\nmilitary classification should be an Army, Navy,
  civilian body,\nwell grounded in science and technology. It should be competent\nto
  advise the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy. It\nshould, moreover,
  have sufficient recognition to secure prompt and\npractical decisions.\n\n\n\nTo
  satisfy these considerations I recommend the establishment of\na Board, made up
  equally of scientists and military men, whose\nfunction would be to pass upon the
  declassification and to control\nthe release for publication of scientific information
  which is now classified.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe release of information from security regulations
  is but\none phase of the problem. The other is to provide for\npreparation of the
  material and its publication in a form and at a price which\nwill facilitate dissemination
  and use. In the case of the Office\nof Scientific Research and Development, arrangements
  have been\nmade for the preparation of manuscripts, while the staffs under our control\nare
  still assembled and in possession of the records, as soon as the\npressure for production
  of results for this war has begun to relax.\n\n\nWe should get this scientific material
  to scientists everywhere with great\npromptness, and at as low a price as is consistent
  with suitable\nformat. We should also get it to the men studying overseas so that\nthey
  will know what has happened in their absence.\n\n\nIt is recommended that measures
  which will encourage and facilitate\nthe preparation and publication of reports
  be adopted forthwith\nby all agencies, governmental and private, possessing scientific\ninformation
  released from security control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne lesson is clear from the reports
  of the several committees\nattached as appendices. The Federal Government should
  accept new\nresponsibilities for promoting the creation of new scientific\nknowledge
  and the development of scientific talent in our youth.\n\n\nThe extent and nature
  of these new responsibilities are set\nforth in detail in the reports of the committees
  whose recommendations\nin this regard are fully endorsed.\n\n\nIn discharging these
  responsibilities Federal funds should be made\navailable. We have given much thought
  to the question of how plans for\nthe use of Federal funds may be arranged so that
  such funds will not drive\nout of the picture funds from local governments, foundations,
  and\nprivate donors. We believe that our proposals will minimize that\neffect, but
  we do not think that it can be completely avoided. We\nsubmit, however, that the
  nation's need for more and better scientific\nresearch is such that the risk must
  be accepted.\n\n\nIt is also clear that the effective discharge of these responsibilities\nwill
  require the full attention of some over-all agency devoted\nto that purpose. There
  should be a focal point within the Government\nfor a concerted program of assisting
  scientific research conducted\noutside of Government. Such an agency should furnish
  the funds needed\nto support basic research in the colleges and universities, should\ncoordinate
  where possible research programs on matters of utmost\nimportance to the national
  welfare, should formulate a national policy\nfor the Government toward science,
  should sponsor the interchange of\nscientific information among scientists and laboratories
  both in\nthis country and abroad, and should ensure that the incentives to\nresearch
  in industry and the universities are maintained. All of the\ncommittees advising
  on these matters agree on the necessity for\nsuch an agency.\n\n\n\n\nThere are
  within Government departments many groups whose interests are\nprimarily those of
  scientific research. Notable examples are found\nwithin the Departments of Agriculture,
  Commerce, Interior, and the\nFederal Security Agency. These groups are concerned
  with science as\ncollateral and peripheral to the major problems of those Departments.\nThese
  groups should remain where they are, and continue to perform\ntheir present functions,
  including the support of agricultural\nresearch by grants to the Land Grant Colleges
  and Experiment Stations,\nsince their largest contribution lies in applying fundamental\nknowledge
  to the special problems of the Departments within which\nthey are established.\n\n\nBy
  the same token these groups cannot be made the repository of\nthe new and large
  responsibilities in science which belong to the\nGovernment and which the Government
  should accept. The recommendations\nin this report which relate to research within
  the Government, to the\nrelease of scientific information, to clarification of the
  tax laws,\nand to the recovery and development of our scientific talent now\nin
  uniform can be implemented by action within the existing\nstructure of the Government.
  But nowhere in the Governmental structure\nreceiving its funds from Congress is
  there an agency adapted to\nsupplementing the support of basic research in the universities,\nboth
  in medicine and the natural sciences; adapted to supporting\nresearch on new weapons
  for both Services; or adapted to\nadministering a program of science scholarships
  and fellowships.\n\n\nA new agency should be established, therefore, by the Congress\nfor
  the purpose. Such an agency, moreover, should be an independent\nagency devoted
  to the support of scientific research and advanced\nscientific education alone.
  Industry learned many years ago that basic\nresearch cannot often be fruitfully
  conducted as an adjunct\nto or a subdivision of an operating agency or department.
  Operating\nagencies have immediate operating goals and are under constant\npressure
  to produce in a tangible way, for that is the test of their\nvalue. None of these
  conditions is favorable to basic research.\nresearch is the exploration of the unknown
  and is necessarily\nspeculative. It is inhibited by conventional approaches, traditions,\nand
  standards. It cannot be satisfactorily conducted in an\natmosphere where it is gauged
  and tested by operating or production\nstandards. Basic scientific research should
  not, therefore, be\nplaced under an operating agency whose paramount concern is
  anything\nother than research. Research will always suffer when put in\ncompetition
  with operations. The decision that there should be a\nnew and independent agency
  was reached by each of the committees\nadvising in these matters.\n\n\nI am convinced
  that these new functions should be centered in one agency.\nScience is fundamentally
  a unitary thing. The number of independent\nagencies should be kept to a minimum.
  Much medical progress,\nfor example, will come from fundamental advances in chemistry.\nSeparation
  of the sciences in tight compartments, as would occur\nif more than one agency were
  involved, would retard and not\nadvance scientific knowledge as a whole.\n\n\n\n\nThere
  are certain basic principles which must underlie the program\nof Government support
  for scientific research and education if\nsuch support is to be effective and if
  it is to avoid impairing\nthe very things we seek to foster. These principles are
  as\nfollows:\n\n\n(1) Whatever the extent of support may be, there must be stability
  of\nfunds over a period of years so that long-range programs may be undertaken.\n(2)
  The agency to administer such funds should be composed of citizens\nselected only
  on the basis of their interest in and capacity to\npromote the work of the agency.
  They should be persons of broad interest\nin and understanding of the peculiarities
  of scientific research and\neducation.\n(3) The agency should promote research through
  contracts or grants\nto organizations outside the Federal Government. It should
  not operate\nany laboratories of its own.\n(4) Support of basic research in the
  public and private colleges,\nuniversities, and research institutes must leave the
  internal\ncontrol of policy, personnel, and the method and scope of the research\nto
  the institutions themselves. This is of the utmost importance.\n(5) While assuring
  complete independence and freedom for the nature,\nscope, and methodology of research
  carried on in the institutions\nreceiving public funds, and while retaining discretion
  in the allocation\nof funds among such institutions, the Foundation proposed herein\nmust
  be responsible to the President and the Congress. Only through such\nresponsibility
  can we maintain the proper relationship between\nscience and other aspects of a
  democratic system. The usual controls\nof audits, reports, budgeting, and the like,
  should, of course, apply\nto the administrative and fiscal operations of the Foundation,
  subject,\nhowever, to such adjustments in procedure as are necessary to meet\nthe
  special requirements of research.\n\n\nBasic research is a long-term process - it
  ceases to be basic if immediate\nresults are expected on short-term support. Methods
  should therefore\nbe found which will permit the agency to make commitments of funds\nfrom
  current appropriations for programs of five years duration or\nlonger. Continuity
  and stability of the program and its support may\nbe expected (a) from the growing
  realization by the Congress of\nthe benefits to the public from scientific research,
  and (b) from\nthe conviction which will grow among those who conduct research under
  the\nauspices of the agency that good quality work will be followed by\ncontinuing
  support.\n\n\n\n\nAs stated earlier in this report, military preparedness requires
  a\npermanent, independent, civilian-controlled organization, having close\nliaison
  with the Army and Navy, but with funds direct from Congress\nand the clear power
  to initiate military research which will\nsupplement and strengthen that carried
  on directly under the control\nof the Army and Navy. As a temporary measure the
  National Academy\nof Sciences has established the Research Board for National Security\nat
  the request of the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy.\nThis is highly
  desirable in order that there may be no interruption\nin the relations between scientists
  and military men after the emergency\nwartime Office of Scientific Research and
  Development goes out\nof existence. The Congress is now considering legislation
  to provide\nfunds for this Board by direct appropriation.\n\n\nI believe that, as
  a permanent measure, it would be appropriate to\nadd to the agency needed to perform
  the other functions recommended\nin this report the responsibilities for civilian-initiated
  and\ncivilian-controlled military research. The function of such a\ncivilian group
  would be primarily to conduct long-range scientific\nresearch on military problems
  - leaving to the Services research\non the improvement of existing weapons.\n\n\nSome
  research on military problems should be conducted, in time of\npeace as well as
  in war, by civilians independently of the\nmilitary establishment. It is the primary
  responsibility of the\nArmy and Navy to train the men, make available the weapons,
  and\nemploy the strategy that will bring victory in combat. The Armed\nServices
  cannot be expected to be experts in all of the complicated\nfields which make it
  possible for a great nation to fight successfully\nin total war. There are certain
  kinds of research - such as\nresearch on the improvement of existing weapons - which
  can\nbest be done within the military establishment. However, the job\nof long-range
  research involving application of the newest\nscientific discoveries to military
  needs should be the responsibility\nof those civilian scientists in the universities
  and in industry\nwho are best trained to discharge it thoroughly and successfully.
  It is\nessential that both kinds of research go forward and that\nthere be the closest
  liaison between the two groups.\n\n\nPlacing the civilian military research function
  in the proposed agency\nwould bring it into close relationship with a broad program\nof
  basic research in both the natural sciences and medicine. A\nbalance between military
  and other research could thus readily\nbe maintained.\n\n\nThe establishment of
  the new agency, including a civilian military\nresearch group, should not be delayed
  by the existence of\nthe Research Board for National Security, which is a temporary\nmeasure.
  Nor should the creation of the new agency be delayed\nby uncertainties in regard
  to the postwar organization of our\nmilitary departments themselves. Clearly, the
  new agency, including\na civilian military research group within it, can remain
  sufficiently\nflexible to adapt its operations to whatever may be the final\norganization
  of the military departments.\n\n\n\n\nIt is my judgment that the national interest
  in scientific research\nand scientific education can best be promoted by the creation
  of a\nNational Research Foundation.\n\n\nI. Purposes. - The National Research Foundation
  should develop\nand promote a national policy for scientific research and\nscientific
  education, should support basic research in nonprofit\norganizations, should develop
  scientific talent in American youth by\nmeans of scholarships and fellowships, and
  should by contract\nand otherwise support long-range research on military matters.\n\n\nII.
  Members. - 1. Responsibility to the people, through the President\nand Congress,
  should be placed in the hands of, say nine\nMembers, who should be persons not otherwise
  connected with the\nGovernment and not representative of any special interest, who\nshould
  be known as National Research Foundation Members, selected\nby the President on
  the basis of their interest in and capacity\nto promote the purposes of the Foundation.\n\n\n2.
  The terms of the Members should be, say, 4 years, and no\nMember should be eligible
  for immediate reappointment provided\nhe has served a full 4-year term. It should
  be arranged that\nthe Members first appointed serve terms of such length that at
  least\ntwo Members are appointed each succeeding year.\n\n\n3. The Members should
  serve without compensation but should be\nentitled to their expenses incurred in
  the performance of their\nduties.\n\n\n4. The Members should elect their own chairman
  annually.\n\n\n5. The chief executive officer of the Foundation should be a\ndirector
  appointed by the Members. Subject to the direction and\nsupervision of the Foundation
  Members (acting as a board), the\ndirector should discharge all the fiscal, legal,
  and administrative\nfunctions of the Foundation. The director should receive a\nsalary
  that is fully adequate to attract an outstanding man to the post.\n\n\n6. There
  should be an administrative office responsible to the\ndirector to handle in one
  place the fiscal, legal, personnel, and\nother similar administrative functions
  necessary to the accomplishment\nof the purposes of the Foundation.\n\n\n7. With
  the exception of the director, the division members, and\none executive officer
  appointed by the director to administer\nthe affairs of each division, all employees
  of the Foundation should\nbe appointed under Civil Service regulations.\n\n\n\nIII.
  Organization. - 1. In order to accomplish the purposes of the Foundation\nthe Members
  should establish several professional Divisions to\nbe responsible to the Members.
  At the outset these Divisions should be:\n\n\na. Division of Medical Research. -
  The function of this Division should\nbe to support medical research.\n\n\nb. Division
  of Natural Sciences. - The function of this Division should\nbe to support research
  in the physical and natural sciences.\n\n\nc. Division of National Defense. - It
  should be the function of this\nDivision to support long-range scientific research
  on military matters.\n\n\nd. Division of Scientific Personnel and Education. - It
  should be the function\nof this Division to support and to supervise the grant of
  scholarships and\nfellowships in science.\n\n\ne. Division of Publications and Scientific
  Collaboration. - This Division\nshould be charged with encouraging the publication
  of scientific knowledge\nand promoting international exchange of scientific information.\n\n\n2.
  Each Division of the Foundation should be made up of at least\nfive members, appointed
  by the Members of the Foundation. In making such\nappointments the Members should
  request and consider recommendations from\nthe National Academy of Sciences which
  should be asked to establish a\nnew National Research Foundation nominating committee
  in order to bring together\nthe recommendations of scientists in all organizations.
  The chairman of each\nDivision should be appointed by the Members of the Foundation.\n\n\n3.
  The division Members should be appointed for such terms as the Members\nof the Foundation
  may determine, and may be reappointed at the discretion\nof the Members. They should
  receive their expenses and compensation for their\nservices at a per diem rate of,
  say, $50 while engaged on business of\nthe Foundation, but no division member should
  receive more than, say,\n$10,000 compensation per year.\n\n\n4. Membership of the
  Division of National Defense should include, in\naddition to, say, five civilian
  members, one representative designated\nby the Secretary of War, and one representative
  of the Secretary of the\nNavy, who should serve without additional compensation
  for this duty.\n\n\n\nIV. Functions. - 1. The Members of the Foundation should have
  the following\nfunctions, powers, and duties:\n\n\na. To formulate over-all policies
  of the Foundation.\n\n\nb. To establish and maintain such offices within the United
  States,\nits territories and possessions, as they may deem necessary.\n\n\nc. To
  meet and function at any place within the United States, its\nterritories and possessions.\n\n\nd.
  To obtain and utilize the services of other Government agencies\nto the extent that
  such agencies are prepared to render such services.\n\n\ne. To adopt, promulgate,
  amend, and rescind rules and regulations\nto carry out the provisions of the legislation
  and the policies\nand practices of the Foundation.\n\n\nf. To review and balance
  the financial requirements of the several Divisions\nand to propose to the President
  the annual estimate for the\nfunds required by each Division. Appropriations should
  be earmarked\nfor the purposes of specific Divisions, but the Foundation should\nbe
  left discretion with respect to the expenditure of each Division's\nfunds.\n\n\ng.
  To make contracts or grants for the conduct of research by negotiation\nwithout
  advertising for bids.\n\n\nAnd with the advice of the National Research Foundation
  Divisions\nconcerned -\n\n\nh. To create such advisory and cooperating agencies
  and councils,\nstate, regional, or national, as in their judgment will aid in\neffectuating
  the purposes of the legislation, and to pay the\nexpenses thereof.\n\n\ni. To enter
  into contracts with or make grants to educational and\nnonprofit research institutions
  for support of scientific research.\n\n\nj. To initiate and finance in appropriate
  agencies, institutions,\nor organizations, research on problems related to the national
  defense.\n\n\nk. To initiate and finance in appropriate organizations research projects\nfor
  which existing facilities are unavailable or inadequate.\n\n\nl. To establish scholarships
  and fellowships in the natural sciences\nincluding biology and medicine.\n\n\nm.
  To promote the dissemination of scientific and technical information\nand to further
  its international exchange.\n\n\nn. To support international cooperation in science
  by providing financial\naid for international meetings, associations of scientific
  societies,\nand scientific research programs organized on an international basis.\n\n\no.
  To devise and promote the use of methods of improving the transition\nbetween research
  and its practical application in industry.\n\n\n\n2. The Divisions should be responsible
  to the Members of the Foundation\nfor - \n\n\na. Formulation of programs and policy
  within the scope of the particular\nDivisions.\n\n\nb. Recommendations regarding
  the allocation of research programs\namong research organizations.\n\n\nc. Recommendation
  of appropriate arrangements between the Foundation\nand the organizations selected
  to carry on the program.\n\n\nd. Recommendation of arrangements with State and local
  authorities\nin regard to cooperation in a program of science scholarships\nand
  fellowships.\n\n\ne. Periodic review of the quality of research being conducted
  under\nthe auspices of the particular Division and revision of the program\nof support
  of research.\n\n\nf. Presentation of budgets of financial needs for the work of
  the Division.\n\n\ng. Maintaining liaison with other scientific research agencies,
  both\ngovernmental and private, concerned with the work of the Division.\n\n\n\nV.
  Patent Policy. - The success of the National Research Foundation\nin promoting scientific
  research in this country will depend to a very\nlarge degree upon the cooperation
  of organizations outside the\nGovernment. In making contracts with or grants to
  such organizations\nthe Foundation should protect the public interest adequately
  and at\nthe same time leave the cooperating organization with adequate freedom\nand
  incentive to conduct scientific research. The public interest will\nnormally be
  adequately protected if the Government receives a royalty-free\nlicense for governmental
  purposes under any patents resulting from work\nfinanced by the Foundation. There
  should be no obligation on the research\ninstitution to patent discoveries made
  as a result of support from the\nFoundation. There should certainly not be any absolute
  requirement that\nall rights in such discoveries be assigned to the Government,
  but it should\nbe left to the discretion of the director and the interested Division\nwhether
  in special cases the public interest requires such an assignment.\nLegislation on
  this point should leave to the Members of the\nFoundation discretion as to its patent
  policy in order that patent arrangements\nmay be adjusted as circumstances and the
  public interest require.\n\n\n\nVI. Special Authority. - In order to insure that
  men of great competence\nand experience may be designated as Members of the Foundation
  and as members\nof the several professional Divisions, the legislation creating\nthe
  Foundation should contain specific authorization so that the Members\nof the Foundation
  and the Members of the Divisions may also engage\nin private and gainful employment,
  notwithstanding the provisions\nof any other laws: provided, however, that no compensation
  for such\nemployment is received in any form from any profit-making institution\nwhich
  receives funds under contract, or otherwise, from the Division or\nDivisions of
  the Foundation with which the individual is concerned.\nIn normal times, in view
  of the restrictive statutory prohibitions\nagainst dual interests on the part of
  Government officials, it would\nbe virtually impossible to persuade persons having
  private employment\nof any kind to serve the Government in an official capacity.
  In order,\nhowever, to secure the part-time services of the most competent\nmen
  as Members of the Foundation and the Divisions, these stringent\nprohibitions should
  be relaxed to the extent indicated.\n\n\nSince research is unlike the procurement
  of standardized items, which\nare susceptible to competitive bidding on fixed specifications,
  the\nlegislation creating the National Research Foundation should free the\nFoundation
  from the obligation to place its contracts for research through\nadvertising for
  bids. This is particularly so since the measure of\na successful research contract
  lies not in the dollar cost but in\nthe qualitative and quantitative contribution
  which is made to\nour knowledge. The extent of this contribution in turn depends
  on\nthe creative spirit and talent which can be brought to bear within a\nresearch
  laboratory. The National Research Foundation must, therefore, be\nfree to place
  its research contracts or grants not only with those\ninstitutions which have a
  demonstrated research capacity but also with\nother institutions whose latent talent
  or creative atmosphere affords\npromise of research success.\n\n\nAs in the case
  of the research sponsored during the war by the Office\nof Scientific Research and
  Development, the research sponsored by\nthe National Research Foundation should
  be conducted, in general,\non an actual cost basis without profit to the institution
  receiving\nthe research contract or grant.\n\n\nThere is one other matter which
  requires special mention. Since research does\nnot fall within the category of normal
  commercial or procurement\noperations which are easily covered by the usual contractual
  relations,\nit is essential that certain statutory and regulatory fiscal\nrequirements
  be waived in the case of research contractors. For example,\nthe National Research
  Foundation should be authorized by legislation\nto make, modify, or amend contracts
  of all kinds with or without\nlegal consideration, and without performance bonds.
  Similarly, advance\npayments should be allowed in the discretion of the Director\nof
  the Foundation when required. Finally, the normal vouchering requirements\nof the
  General Accounting Office with respect to detailed itemization or\nsubstantiation
  of vouchers submitted under cost contracts should be\nrelaxed for research contractors.
  Adherence to the usual procedures\nin the case of research contracts will impair
  the efficiency of research\noperations and will needlessly increase the cost of
  the work of the\nGovernment. Without the broad authority along these lines which
  was\ncontained in the First War Powers Act and its implementing Executive\nOrders,
  together with the special relaxation of vouchering requirements\ngranted by the
  General Accounting Office, the Office of Scientific\nResearch and Development would
  have been gravely handicapped in carrying\non research on military matters during
  this war. Colleges and universities\nin which research will be conducted principally
  under contract with the\nFoundation are, unlike commercial institutions, not equipped
  to handle\nthe detailed vouchering procedures and auditing technicalities which\nare
  required of the usual Government contractors.\n\n\n\n\nVII. Budget. - Studies by
  the several committees provide a partial\nbasis for making an estimate of the order
  of magnitude of\nthe funds required to implement the proposed program. Clearly the
  program\nshould grow in a healthy manner from modest beginnings. The following\nvery
  rough estimates are given for the first year of operation after the\nFoundation
  is organized and operating, and for the fifth year of operation\nwhen it is expected
  that the operations would have reached a fairly\nstable level:\n\n\n\nThe National
  Research Foundation herein proposed meets the urgent need\nof the days ahead. The
  form of the organization suggested is the\nresult of considerable deliberation.
  The form is important. The very\nsuccessful pattern of organization of the National
  Advisory Committee\nfor Aeronautics, which has promoted basic research on problems
  of flight\nduring the past thirty years, has been carefully considered in proposing\nthe
  method of appointment of Members of the Foundation and in defining\ntheir responsibilities.
  Moreover, whatever program is established it\nis vitally important that it satisfy
  the Five Fundamentals.\n\nThe Foundation here proposed has been described only in
  outline. The\nexcellent reports of the committees which studied these matters are\nattached
  as appendices. They will be of aid in furnishing detailed\nsuggestions.\n\nLegislation
  is necessary. It should be drafted with great care. Early\naction is imperative,
  however, if this nation is to meet the\nchallenge of science and fully utilize the
  potentialities of science. On\nthe wisdom with which we bring science to bear against
  the problems\nof the coming years depends in large measure our future as a nation."
