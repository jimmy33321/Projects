                  A secret U.S. policy that prohibits immigration officials from reviewing the social media messages of foreign citizens applying for U.S. visas was reportedly kept in place over fears of a civil liberties backlash and “bad public relations.” Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson refused in early 2014 to end the policy, even though several other officials in the organization pressed for such a policy change, ABC News reported Monday. John Cohen, a former acting under-secretary at the Department of Homeland Security and currently a national security consultant for ABC News, said he pushed for a change in 2014 that would allow a review of social media messages posted publically as terror group followers increasingly turned to Twitter and Facebook. "Immigration, security, law enforcement officials recognized at the time that it was important to more extensively review public social media postings because they offered potential insights into whether somebody was an extremist or potentially connected to a terrorist organization or a supporter of the movement," Cohen, who left DHS in June 2014, told ABC News.

                  Cohen’s account comes as members of Congress question why U.S. officials failed to review the social media posts of San Bernardino terrorist Tashfeen Malik.

                  Malik received a U.S. visa in May 2014, despite what the FBI said were extensive social media messages about jihad and martyrdom. Cohen said that officials from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement both pressed for a change in policy, which eventually became the subject of a meeting in 2014 chaired by Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, other top deputies and representatives of the DHS Office of Civil Liberties and the Office of Privacy. "The primary concern was that it would be viewed negatively if it was disclosed publicly and there were concerns that it would be embarrassing," Cohen told ABC’s Good Morning America on Monday. Cohen added that he and other officials were deeply disappointed that the senior leadership would not approve a review of what were publicly-posted online messages. "There is no excuse for not using every resource at our disposal to fully vet individuals before they come to the United States," told ABC News.

                  White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Monday the Homeland Security and State departments have been asked to review the process for screening people who apply for visas and to return with specific recommendations. "I think the president's top priority here is the national security and safety of the American people," Earnest said. "And that will continue to be the case with ensuring that this K-1 visa program is effectively implemented."

                  Malik came to the United States in 2014 on a K-1, or fiancé, visa. Earnest did not provide specifics of the security review for visas, but said one consideration going forward is resources. The government approved more than 9.9 million visa applications during the 2014 budget year. The department said three pilot programs to specifically incorporate "appropriate" social media reviews into its vetting process were launched in the last year and the department is looking at other ways to use social media posts.

                  The DHS is working on a plan to scrutinize social media posts as part of its visa application process before certain people are allowed entry into the nation, a person familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal on Monday.

                  The move is part of a new focus on the use of social networking sites following the shooting rampage in San Bernardino, Calif., the person told the Journal.

                  The pilot programs currently used by DHS do not sweep up all social media posts, though government officials have kept details of the programs closely held, as they do not want to reveal the precise process they use to try and identify potential threats. On Sunday, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., demanded that the U.S. immediately initiate a program that would check the social media sites of those admitted on visas.

                  Sen. Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CBS' "Face the Nation" on Sunday that Farook was radicalized as early as 2010 and Malik as far back as 2012, which would have been years before her visa was processed.

                  Rep. Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, said Monday that the committee is working on legislation that would require online information, including social media accounts, be reviewed as part of the background check for visa applicants, including K-1 visas. Allowing visa vetters to review social media postings however is no guarantee that a would-be immigrant who has radicalized views will be discovered. Facebook and Twitter users can make their pages private and aliases are routinely employed. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., introduced legislation last week that would require social media companies to report to law enforcement any "terrorist activity" they became aware of — for example, attack planning, recruiting or the distribution of terrorist material. Representatives with the technology industry say that would become a massive new liability for companies, chill free speech online and increase the number of reports funneled to law enforcement, making it difficult to find credible threats.

- "\t\t\t\tA secret U.S. policy that prohibits immigration officials from reviewing
  the social media messages of foreign citizens applying for U.S. visas was reportedly
  kept in place over fears of a civil liberties backlash and “bad public relations.”
  Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson refused in early 2014 to end the policy,
  even though several other officials in the organization pressed for such a policy
  change, ABC News reported Monday. John Cohen, a former acting under-secretary at
  the Department of Homeland Security and currently a national security consultant
  for ABC News, said he pushed for a change in 2014 that would allow a review of social
  media messages posted publically as terror group followers increasingly turned to
  Twitter and Facebook. \"Immigration, security, law enforcement officials recognized
  at the time that it was important to more extensively review public social media
  postings because they offered potential insights into whether somebody was an extremist
  or potentially connected to a terrorist organization or a supporter of the movement,\"
  Cohen, who left DHS in June 2014, told ABC News.Cohen’s account comes as members
  of Congress question why U.S. officials failed to review the social media posts
  of San Bernardino terrorist Tashfeen Malik.Malik received a U.S. visa in May 2014,
  despite what the FBI said were extensive social media messages about jihad and martyrdom.
  Cohen said that officials from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services
  and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement both pressed for a change in policy,
  which eventually became the subject of a meeting in 2014 chaired by Homeland Security
  Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, other top deputies and representatives of the
  DHS Office of Civil Liberties and the Office of Privacy. \"The primary concern was
  that it would be viewed negatively if it was disclosed publicly and there were concerns
  that it would be embarrassing,\" Cohen told ABC’s Good Morning America on Monday.
  Cohen added that he and other officials were deeply disappointed that the senior
  leadership would not approve a review of what were publicly-posted online messages.
  \"There is no excuse for not using every resource at our disposal to fully vet individuals
  before they come to the United States,\" told ABC News.White House spokesman Josh
  Earnest said on Monday the Homeland Security and State departments have been asked
  to review the process for screening people who apply for visas and to return with
  specific recommendations. \"I think the president's top priority here is the national
  security and safety of the American people,\" Earnest said. \"And that will continue
  to be the case with ensuring that this K-1 visa program is effectively implemented.\"Malik
  came to the United States in 2014 on a K-1, or fiancé, visa. Earnest did not provide
  specifics of the security review for visas, but said one consideration going forward
  is resources. The government approved more than 9.9 million visa applications during
  the 2014 budget year. The department said three pilot programs to specifically incorporate
  \"appropriate\" social media reviews into its vetting process were launched in the
  last year and the department is looking at other ways to use social media posts.The
  DHS is working on a plan to scrutinize social media posts as part of its visa application
  process before certain people are allowed entry into the nation, a person familiar
  with the matter told the Wall Street Journal on Monday.The move is part of a new
  focus on the use of social networking sites following the shooting rampage in San
  Bernardino, Calif., the person told the Journal.  The pilot programs currently used
  by DHS do not sweep up all social media posts, though government officials have
  kept details of the programs closely held, as they do not want to reveal the precise
  process they use to try and identify potential threats. On Sunday, Sen. Charles
  Schumer, D-N.Y., demanded that the U.S. immediately initiate a program that would
  check the social media sites of those admitted on visas.\"Had they checked out Tashfeen
  Malik,\" he said, \"maybe those people in San Bernardino would be alive.\"Sen. Richard
  Burr, a North Carolina Republican who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, told
  CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that Farook was radicalized as early as 2010
  and Malik as far back as 2012, which would have been years before her visa was processed.\"We
  want to look at how our immigration process for a visa for a spouse broke down,
  that they didn't notice the radicalization,\" Burr said.Rep. Bob Goodlatte, a Republican
  from Virginia who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, said Monday that the committee
  is working on legislation that would require online information, including social
  media accounts, be reviewed as part of the background check for visa applicants,
  including K-1 visas. Allowing visa vetters to review social media postings however
  is no guarantee that a would-be immigrant who has radicalized views will be discovered.
  Facebook and Twitter users can make their pages private and aliases are routinely
  employed. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., introduced
  legislation last week that would require social media companies to report to law
  enforcement any \"terrorist activity\" they became aware of — for example, attack
  planning, recruiting or the distribution of terrorist material. Representatives
  with the technology industry say that would become a massive new liability for companies,
  chill free speech online and increase the number of reports funneled to law enforcement,
  making it difficult to find credible threats.Click for more from ABC News.Click

  \       \n        \n            \n                A secret U.S. policy that prohibits
  immigration officials from reviewing the social media messages of foreign citizens
  applying for U.S. visas was reportedly kept in place over fears of a civil liberties
  backlash and “bad public relations.” Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson refused
  in early 2014 to end the policy, even though several other officials in the organization
  pressed for such a policy change, ABC News reported Monday. John Cohen, a former
  acting under-secretary at the Department of Homeland Security and currently a national
  security consultant for ABC News, said he pushed for a change in 2014 that would
  allow a review of social media messages posted publically as terror group followers
  increasingly turned to Twitter and Facebook. \"Immigration, security, law enforcement
  officials recognized at the time that it was important to more extensively review
  public social media postings because they offered potential insights into whether
  somebody was an extremist or potentially connected to a terrorist organization or
  a supporter of the movement,\" Cohen, who left DHS in June 2014, told ABC News.\n
  \               \n                \r\n\n            \n                Cohen’s account
  comes as members of Congress question why U.S. officials failed to review the social
  media posts of San Bernardino terrorist Tashfeen Malik.\n                \n                \r\n\n
  \           \n                Malik received a U.S. visa in May 2014, despite what
  the FBI said were extensive social media messages about jihad and martyrdom. Cohen
  said that officials from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services and
  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement both pressed for a change in policy, which
  eventually became the subject of a meeting in 2014 chaired by Homeland Security
  Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, other top deputies and representatives of the
  DHS Office of Civil Liberties and the Office of Privacy. \"The primary concern was
  that it would be viewed negatively if it was disclosed publicly and there were concerns
  that it would be embarrassing,\" Cohen told ABC’s Good Morning America on Monday.
  Cohen added that he and other officials were deeply disappointed that the senior
  leadership would not approve a review of what were publicly-posted online messages.
  \"There is no excuse for not using every resource at our disposal to fully vet individuals
  before they come to the United States,\" told ABC News.\n                \n                \r\n\n
  \           \n                White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Monday
  the Homeland Security and State departments have been asked to review the process
  for screening people who apply for visas and to return with specific recommendations.
  \"I think the president's top priority here is the national security and safety

  in 2014 on a K-1, or fiancé, visa. Earnest did not provide specifics of the security
  review for visas, but said one consideration going forward is resources. The government
  approved more than 9.9 million visa applications during the 2014 budget year. The
  department said three pilot programs to specifically incorporate \"appropriate\"
  social media reviews into its vetting process were launched in the last year and
  the department is looking at other ways to use social media posts.\n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                The DHS is working on a plan
  to scrutinize social media posts as part of its visa application process before
  certain people are allowed entry into the nation, a person familiar with the matter
  told the Wall Street Journal on Monday.\n                \n                \r\n\n
  \           \n                The move is part of a new focus on the use of social
  networking sites following the shooting rampage in San Bernardino, Calif., the person
  told the Journal.  \n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                The
  pilot programs currently used by DHS do not sweep up all social media posts, though
  government officials have kept details of the programs closely held, as they do
  not want to reveal the precise process they use to try and identify potential threats.
  On Sunday, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., demanded that the U.S. immediately initiate
  a program that would check the social media sites of those admitted on visas.\n
  \               \n                \r\n\n            \n                \"Had they
  checked out Tashfeen Malik,\" he said, \"maybe those people in San Bernardino would
  be alive.\"\n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                Sen.
  Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee,
  told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that Farook was radicalized as early as
  2010 and Malik as far back as 2012, which would have been years before her visa
  was processed.\n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                \"We
  want to look at how our immigration process for a visa for a spouse broke down,
  that they didn't notice the radicalization,\" Burr said.\n                \n                \r\n\n
  \           \n                Rep. Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia who
  chairs the House Judiciary Committee, said Monday that the committee is working
  on legislation that would require online information, including social media accounts,
  be reviewed as part of the background check for visa applicants, including K-1 visas.
  Allowing visa vetters to review social media postings however is no guarantee that
  a would-be immigrant who has radicalized views will be discovered. Facebook and
  Twitter users can make their pages private and aliases are routinely employed. Sen.
  Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., introduced legislation
  last week that would require social media companies to report to law enforcement
  any \"terrorist activity\" they became aware of — for example, attack planning,
  recruiting or the distribution of terrorist material. Representatives with the technology
  industry say that would become a massive new liability for companies, chill free
  speech online and increase the number of reports funneled to law enforcement, making
  it difficult to find credible threats.\n                \n                \r\n\n

  officials from reviewing the social media messages of foreign citizens applying
  for U.S. visas was reportedly kept in place over fears of a civil liberties backlash
  and “bad public relations.” Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson refused in early
  2014 to end the policy, even though several other officials in the organization
  pressed for such a policy change, ABC News reported Monday. John Cohen, a former
  acting under-secretary at the Department of Homeland Security and currently a national
  security consultant for ABC News, said he pushed for a change in 2014 that would
  allow a review of social media messages posted publically as terror group followers
  increasingly turned to Twitter and Facebook. \"Immigration, security, law enforcement
  officials recognized at the time that it was important to more extensively review
  public social media postings because they offered potential insights into whether
  somebody was an extremist or potentially connected to a terrorist organization or
  a supporter of the movement,\" Cohen, who left DHS in June 2014, told ABC News.Cohen’s
  account comes as members of Congress question why U.S. officials failed to review
  the social media posts of San Bernardino terrorist Tashfeen Malik.Malik received
  a U.S. visa in May 2014, despite what the FBI said were extensive social media messages
  about jihad and martyrdom. Cohen said that officials from United States Citizenship
  and Immigration Services and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement both pressed
  for a change in policy, which eventually became the subject of a meeting in 2014
  chaired by Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, other top deputies
  and representatives of the DHS Office of Civil Liberties and the Office of Privacy.
  \"The primary concern was that it would be viewed negatively if it was disclosed
  publicly and there were concerns that it would be embarrassing,\" Cohen told ABC’s
  Good Morning America on Monday. Cohen added that he and other officials were deeply
  disappointed that the senior leadership would not approve a review of what were
  publicly-posted online messages. \"There is no excuse for not using every resource
  at our disposal to fully vet individuals before they come to the United States,\"
  told ABC News.White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Monday the Homeland Security
  and State departments have been asked to review the process for screening people
  who apply for visas and to return with specific recommendations. \"I think the president's
  top priority here is the national security and safety of the American people,\"
  Earnest said. \"And that will continue to be the case with ensuring that this K-1
  visa program is effectively implemented.\"Malik came to the United States in 2014
  on a K-1, or fiancé, visa. Earnest did not provide specifics of the security review
  for visas, but said one consideration going forward is resources. The government
