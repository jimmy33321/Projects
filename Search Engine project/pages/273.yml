                  ANCIENTS AND MODERNS INTHE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
- |2
                  The idea of progress, finding expression in many
- |2
                      forms and levels, was most vociferously discussed during the
- |2
                      eighteenth century in the literary quarrel of the an-
- |2
                          cients and moderns, which embraced questions of au- thority, antiquarianism, and the new experimental sci- ence. The attack on authority in science and
- |2
                      literary criticism first foreshadowed and later paralleled the
- |2
                      challenging of authority in religion and politics, which developed during
- |2
                      the Enlightenment in systems of deism and political democracy.
- |2
                  Most of the arguments in favor of modern learning as opposed to ancient grew
- |2
                      out of the efforts of Descartes and Bacon to persuade their respective
- |2
                      countrymen to adopt a new method of judging and seeking truth. Both
- |2
                      rejected the authority of the an- cients in
- |2
                      scientific questions—Bacon as part of his inductive method and
- |2
                      Descartes as part of his system of “methodical
- |2
                      doubt.” Descartes asserted in the first article, The Passions of the Mind (1649):
- "                \n"
- |2
                      What the ancients have taught is so scanty and for the most part so
- |2
                          lacking in credibility that I may not hope for any kind of approach
- |2
                          toward truth except by rejecting all the paths which they have
- |2
                          followed.
- "                \n"
- |2
                  Aristotle, was first attacked and discredited in the realm of science, and
- |2
                      then disputed in literature. Homer developed as another natural target.
- |2
                      Critics assumed that if they could sufficiently tarnish his image,
- |2
                      they would succeed in proving the superiority of the modern age.
- |2
                  Abbé Pons in France, for example, praised Descartes for subjecting
- |2
                      the scientific system of Aristotle to rigid scrutiny and exposing the
- |2
                      latter's deviations from truth. Then he pointed to the parallel between the
- |2
                      long reign of Aristotle in science and that of Homer in literature. He
- |2
                      argued in his Letter on the “Iliad” of La Motte (Lettre sur “l'Iliade” de la Motte,
- |2
                      1714) that the rejec- tion of Aristotle
- |2
                      furnished a presentiment of the immi- nent fall
- |2
                      of Homer. Two years later, the English poet077
- |2
                       Sir Richard Blackmore drew the same parallel between science
- |2
                      and criticism in his Essay upon Epick Poetry:
- |2
                      “Unless the Admirers of Homer will assert and
- |2
                      prove their Infallibility,” he challenged, “why may
- |2
                      they not be deceiv'd as well as the Disciples and Adorers ofAristotle?”
- |2
                  Even after Aristotle had been dethroned in the realm of science, it remained
- |2
                      difficult to budge Homer from his pedestal. Critical opinion in the late
- |2
                      seventeenth century generally agreed with Boileau that since Homer had
- |2
                      been constantly admired and followed throughout the ages, he should always
- |2
                      continue to be admired and imitated. The abbé Terrasson,
- |2
                      however, in his Critical Dissertation on the
- |2
                          “Iliad” (Dissertation
- |2
                          critique sur “l'Iliade,” 1715) revolted against
- |2
                      this logic. For him, literary work should not be judged according to
- |2
                      the reputation it had enjoyed in the past, but ac-
- |2
                          cording to its conformity to reason and nature. Literary
- |2
                      criticism, according to Terrasson, should adopt the philosophic spirit
- |2
                      which had been responsible for progress in the natural sciences,
- |2
                      acknowledging the superiority of “reason which leads us to
- |2
                      attribute each phenomenon to its proper and natural principle,”
- |2
                          in- dependent of the opinion of other
- |2
                      men. Blackmore said essentially the same:
- "                \n"
- |2
                      It's clear, that Aristotle form'd all his Axioms and
- |2
                          Doctrines in Poetry, from the Patterns of Homer and other Greek
- |2
                          Writers; and without assigning any Reason of his Positions. ... But it
- |2
                          is not the Authority of the greatest Masters, but solid and convincing
- |2
                          Evidence, that must engage our Belief.
- "                \n"
- |2
                  The debate concerned not only the two separate issues of which age possessed
- |2
                      greater genius or mental powers and which possessed greater knowledge,
- |2
                      but also a far more important one; did an increase of knowledge mean
- |2
                      progress? This is another way of asking whether people are actually happier

                      in the modern world. The partisans of the ancients were obviously
- |2
                      accepting a form of cultural primitivism. Some men who did not profess any
- |2
                      form of primitivism, nevertheless considered the new science as
- |2
                      nothing more than an interesting development, which did nothing to
- |2
                      change man's nature or to make him any happier. Others justified their
- |2
                      indifference to the ques- tion by appealing to
- |2
                      the commonplace observation of the century—that human nature
- |2
                      never changes. Lord Chesterfield, for example, prided himself on the dis- covery “that nature was the same
- |2
                      three thousand years ago as it is at present; that men were but men
- |2
                      then as well as now.” He was willing to grant that modes and
- |2
                      customs often vary, but insisted that “human nature is always
- |2
                      the same.” Taking a common- place
- |2
                      metaphor, originally introduced by Montaigne, he argued in a letter to his
- |2
                      son, 7 February 1749, that there is no more reason to assume that men were
- |2
                       better, braver, or wiser in ancient times than “to sup- pose that the animals or vegetables were
- |2
                      better then than they are now.” La Bruyère in another
- |2
                      famous analogy, from his Caractères (1687),
- |2
                      compared authors who espoused the side of the moderns to robust
- |2
                      infants who suck the nourishing milk of their nurses and then revolt
- |2
                      and beat them.
- |2
                  The major disputants in the quarrel between ancients and moderns made use of
- |2
                      three primary metaphorical expressions which passed from pen to pen
- |2
                      without acknowledgment: (1) the paradox that modern men are the real
- |2
                      ancients; (2) the image of the human race as a single man; and (3) the
- |2
                      image of a giant with a dwarf on his shoulders.
- |2
                  (1) The paradox concerning the antiquity of modern men derives from Bacon,
- |2
                      who expressed it in Latin,Antiquitas saeculi juventus mundi
- |2
                      (“Ancient times are the youth of the world”). Our
- |2
                      times then are the an- cient times
- |2
                      “when the world is ancient and not those which we account
- |2
                          ordine retrogrado by a computation
- |2
                      backward from ourselves.” The same paradox may be found in
- |2
                      Descartes, Pascal, and Malebranche. TheEncyclopédie, in the article,
- |2
                          “Anciens,” called it
- |2
                      an ingenious sophism, equivalent to the pleasantry, le monde est si vieux qu'il radote (“the world is
- |2
                      so old it drivels”). In the last decade of the eighteenth
- |2
                      century, Thomas Paine gave the argument a political twist inThe Rights of Man (1791) in order to discredit
- |2
                      Burke's concept of prescription. The only reason for studying
- |2
                      governments in the ancient world, as far as Paine was concerned, was to
- |2
                      profit by their errors and to perceive later improvements by contrast.
- |2
                      “Those who lived a hundred or a thousand years ago,”
- |2
                      Paine affirmed, “were then moderns as we are now.”
- |2
                  (2) The image of the human race as a single man compared the life span of
- |2
                      the entire human race to one man's progress from cradle to grave. It exists
- |2
                      in both Roger Bacon and Francis Bacon and in all the major
- |2
                      participants in the ancient-moderns dispute. The figure could be used by
- |2
                      one side to show that the race was already approaching senility, and by the
- |2
                      other side to characterize the ancients as infants.
- |2
                  (3) The giant-dwarf image represents the ancients as giants supporting the
- |2
                      moderns as dwarfs on their shoulders so that the latter may have an
- |2
                      advantageous view of nature. The metaphor figured prominently during
- |2
                      the Renaissance in the writing of the Spaniard, Juan Luis Vives
- |2
                      (1492-1540), and in Ben Jonson (1572-1637), and was reintroduced by
- |2
                      Fontenelle. This image may also be used to support either side of the
- |2
                      controversy: the ancients interpreted the puny figure of the modern dwarf
- |2
                      as a sign of decay, but the mod- erns considered
- |2
                      his advantageous position as a symbol of the superior knowledge of modern
- |2
                      times.

- |2
                  The debate was introduced into the literary realm by Alessandro Tassoni in
- |2
                      the last of his Ten Books of Miscellaneous Thoughts
- |2
                          (Dieci libri di pensieri diversi [1620]).
- |2
                      In theory he seemed to favor the ancients by attacking the argument that
- |2
                      knowledge is cumulative and that, therefore, it must always be the latest
- |2
                          gener- ation which has the greatest
- |2
                      amount of it. Such reason- ing, he affirmed,
- |2
                      would hold only if study and research were continuously carried on by
- |2
                      outstanding minds, but in actuality learning has frequently been
- |2
                      captured by hostile forces or inferior intellects and thus learning
- |2
                      may decline instead of advance. In his pragmatic sur-
- |2
                          vey of the concrete achievements of civilization, how- ever, Tassoni acknowledged the superiority of the
- |2
                      moderns. It follows from Tassoni's arguments that progress does not need to
- |2
                      take place in a straight line, but it may occur in spurts and jumps; some
- |2
                      areas may go forward while others go backwards, and there may even be
- |2
                      occasional periods of total retrogression.
- |2
                  In France, the preliminary skirmishes began in 1635, when a minor poet,
- |2
                      Boisrobert, who had probably read Tassoni in translation, attacked the
- |2
                      ancients before the French Academy. He was followed by Desmarets de
- |2
                      Saint-Sorlin who argued passionately in his Discourse to
- |2
                          Prove That Only Christian Subjects are Appropriate to Heroic
- |2
                      Poetry (Discours pour prouver que les sujets
- |2
                          chrétiens sont seuls propres à la poésie
- |2
                          héroïque [1673]), that Christian miracles
- |2
                      are far superior to pagan my- thology as
- |2
                      subjects for heroic poetry. Although the dispute over the use of Christian
- |2
                      subject matter in the epic tradition developed in England as a
- |2
                      separate contest, completely independent of that between the ancients
- |2
                      and moderns, the two contests are themati-
- |2
                      cally related. The advocates of Christian poetry took up their
- |2
                      position with the moderns, for the substitution of Christian materials for
- |2
                      the classical deities represents a triumph of the contemporary world over
- |2
                      the past. Desmarets maintained that the epic poet must be not only a
- |2
                      story-teller, but also an authority on “history, geography,
- |2
                      astronomy, matters of nature, logic, ethics, rhetoric, fables, agriculture,
- |2
                      architecture, painting, sculpture, perspective, and music.” This
- |2
                      requirement of extensive knowledge for the epic poet obviously put the
- |2
                      ancients at a great disadvantage. John Dryden similarly required the epic
- |2
                      poet to combine the “natu- ral
- |2
                      endowments, of a large invention, a ripe judgment, and a strong
- |2
                      memory” with “the knowledge of liberal arts and
- |2
                      sciences, and particularly moral philosophy, the mathematics, geography,
- |2
                      and history.”
- |2
                  Carrying the controversy to the completely different area of linguistics,
- |2
                      François Charpentier in 1683 pub-
- |2
                      lished a treatise, On the Excellence of the French
- |2
                              Lan- guage (De
- |2
                          l'Excellence de la langue française), arguing that
- |2
                      modern French rather than the classical languages
- |2
                       should be the medium for inscriptions on public monu- ments. Taking a position which Alexander
- |2
                      Pope was to express a generation later in his satires, (First Epistle of the Second Book of Horace [1737]), and
- |2
                      Marivaux in his Miroir (XI [1755]), Charpentier
- |2
                      maintained that those who expressed a preference for the ancients did
- |2
                      so because they were jealous of contemporary authors.
- |2
                  In 1687 Charles Perrault united literary and scien-
- |2
                          tific considerations in a poem exalting his own times,The Century of Louis XIV (Le
- |2
                          Siècle de Louis le Grand) which he read before the
- |2
                      Academy. The an- cients were great in their
- |2
                      way, he admitted, but still had all the limitations of human beings. Homer
- |2
                      had written under the disadvantages of living in a primitive society
- |2
                      and, therefore, had fallen into various errors which he could have avoided
- |2
                      had he written in the modern world. Without qualification Perrault
- |2
                      affirmed that the ancient authorities in science and history,
- |2
                      Aristotle and Herodotus, had already been discredited. As symbols of the
- |2
                      scientific superiority of the moderns, Perrault featured in his poem a
- |2
                      detailed description of the telescope and microscope. We may find
- |2
                      close parallels to these passages in many French and English poems as
- |2
                      well as in a Russian Georgic poem, Letter on the Use of
- |2
                          Glass (1752) by M. V. Lomonosov.
- |2
                  Perrault further developed his notions in a prose dialogue, Parallels between Ancients and Moderns (1688-96),
- |2
                      not actually intended to show parallels, but instead differences and
- |2
                      distinctions. For the gathering of ammunition against the ancients, he
- |2
                      appealed to the astronomer Huygens, who supplied him with informa- tion concerning the advance of
- |2
                      science. On the literary side Perrault repeated his charge that Homer
- |2
                      and Vergil had been guilty of an infinite number of errors because
- |2
                      they lacked knowledge which came to light in later times. As one example of
- |2
                      Homer's great defi- ciencies, his lack of
- |2
                      verisimilitude, Perrault pointed to the victory of Ulysses and three of his
- |2
                      friends over 108 suitors of Penelope: the four warriors surmounting
- |2
                      impossible odds to kill their foes without taking them by surprise, while
- |2
                      Ulysses in the midst of the fray delivered a long moral discourse.
- |2
                  Mme Dacier answered the objections to the errors and implausibilities of the
- |2
                      ancients by affirming that whatever reproaches are made against Homer may
- |2
                      be made equally against the Old Testament. In the preface to her
- |2
                      translation of the Iliad (1711) she confined the
- |2
                      argument to social customs rather than to scientific knowledge. The epic
- |2
                      poet must portray customs and behavior exactly as they are in his own
- |2
                      times; otherwise his imitation of nature will be false and his heroes
- |2
                      no more credible than heroes of romances. “In a word, the
- |2
                      poem imitates what exists and not that which has come into being only after
- |2
                      it.” Since Homer could not079
- |2
                       conform to the usages of later centuries, it is necessary for
- |2
                      later centuries to comprehend the customs of his century.
- |2
                  In 1688 Fontenelle published a volume of pastoral poetry in which he
- |2
                      inserted a Digression sur les anciens et les
- |2
                      modernes. Here he maintained that the question of the preeminence
- |2
                      of ancients or moderns may be reduced to a consideration of whether the
- |2
                      trees of former times were taller than those growing at present, a
- |2
                      problem which had been presented by Montaigne in the Apologie de Raymond Sebond. This is a phase of the related
- |2
                      theological doctrine of the degeneration of the world. Fontenelle argued
- |2
                      that if biological differences exist in man as well as in plants,
- |2
                      these differences are caused by geography and climate, not by
- |2
                      chronology. And since the climate is essentially the same in Greece, Italy,
- |2
                      and France, all human beings, including the ancients and moderns, Greeks,
- |2
                      Romans, and French, are biologically equal. A scientist of mod- ern times, he affirmed, because of the
- |2
                      accumulation of information knows ten times more than one of the times
- |2
                      of Augustus, and he has ten times greater facility in acquiring his
- |2
                      knowledge. The great reputation of the ancients is based upon prejudice and
- |2
                      tradition. In literature, the names of the ancients sound better to
- |2
                      our ears merely because they are Greek and Latin. Before Fontenelle,
- |2
                      eloquence and poetry had been the main subjects of contention, but for him
- |2
                      they counted less than the sciences. He admitted that the ancients
- |2
                      could theoretically have attained perfection in elo-
- |2
                          quence and poetry, but granted that they had actually attained
- |2
                      it only in the former. Critics were accustomed to consider both Greeks and
- |2
                      Romans as ancients, but Fontenelle affirmed that in a relative sense the
- |2
                      Romans were moderns. In literary merit, he placed Cicero over
- |2
                      Demosthenes, Vergil over both Theocritus and Homer, Horace over Pindar, and
- |2
                      Livy over the Greek histori- ans. And he
- |2
                      asserted for his contemporaries a further claim to
- |2
                      superiority—that they had developed new literary forms like the
- |2
                      novel, and the lettres galantes which had not
- |2
                      existed in antiquity.
- |2
                  Fontenelle also touched on the faults of Homer, which the latter's admirers
- |2
                      had attempted to exonerate or vindicate under the plea of poetic license.
- |2
                      Homer, for example, indiscriminately mingled as many as five dialects
- |2
                      in a single line, a process equivalent to a French poet's blending the
- |2
                      dialects of Picardy, Gas- cony, Normandy, and
- |2
                      Brittany with ordinary French. Both Perrault and Fontenelle used the single
- |2
                      man image, but the latter refused to carry the comparison to its
- |2
                      logical end, resolutely affirming that the human race would never
- |2
                      degenerate into senility.
- |2
                  Fontenelle, nevertheless, had no illusions concerning the intrinsic merits
- |2
                      of mankind, but shared the cautious
- |2
                       skepticism of those who rejected the doctrine of prog- ress. In an imaginary dialogue between
- |2
                      Montaigne and Socrates (1683), he represents the former as charging,
- |2
                      in connection with the doctrine of universal degenera- tion, that men do not know how to use the
- |2
                      knowledge they acquire. They are like birds too ignorant to stay away
- |2
                      from a net which has already snared thousands of their kind. Pierre Bayle
- |2
                      pessimistically observed in like vein in his Historical
- |2
                          and Critical Dictionary (1695-97), that “the world is
- |2
                      too undisciplined to profit from the maladies of former
- |2
                      centuries.” “Each century behaves as though it were
- |2
                      the first.”
- |2
                  During the seventeenth century Nicolas Boileau-
- |2
                          Despréaux was considered to be the foremost French
- |2
                      theoretician of classicism and defender of the Ancients. In his Critical Reflections on Longinus (1694), he
- |2
                      emphasized what he considered to be one of the strongest arguments in favor
- |2
                      of ancient writers, the constant admiration in which they have
- |2
                      continually been held; a sure and infallible proof, he felt, that they
- |2
                      should always be admired. Yet he also admitted in a letter to Perrault,
- |2
                      published by the latter in 1701, that although no French Cicero or Vergil
- |2
                      had yet appeared, the Age of Louis XIV had surpassed any previous age
- |2
                      in tragedy, painting, architecture, and especially in philosophy and
- |2
                      science. He virtually abandoned the ancients when he admitted,
- |2
                      “the Age of Louis XIV is not only comparable but superior to the
- |2
                      most famous ages of antiquity, even the Age of Augustus.” Had
- |2
                      the debate depended on authority alone, Boileau's ca- pitulation would have meant the total victory of the
- |2
                      moderns at least in France, but other critics continued to exalt the
- |2
                      preeminence of the ancients as still others disparaged them.
- |2
                  Abbé Jean Terrasson in a posthumous work, Philoso- phy Applicable to All
- |2
                      Subjects (1754), affirmed that the superiority of the moderns is a
- |2
                      necessary and natural effect of the very constitution of the human
- |2
                      spirit. Fontenelle was wrong, he believed, in resting the argument on
- |2
                      a comparison between trees in various centuries. Since trees in all ages
- |2
                      remain the same, the parallel merely places the moderns on an equal
- |2
                      plane with the ancients. Men, unlike trees, endow their progeny with
- |2
                      their knowledge and advice. The prog- ress of
- |2
                      the human spirit Terrasson illustrated with the old allegory of the human
- |2
                      race as a single man. Instead of accepting such a system, which provides us
- |2
                      infants for teachers and models, Terrasson exhorted us to re- spect our nephews over our ancestors. Our
- |2
                      progeny will inevitably have greater enlightenment than we ourselves.
- |2
                  This is not far from the confident assertion of M. J. de Condorcet in his
- |2
                          Historical Sketch of the Progress of the Human
- |2
                      Mind (1793) that no limit can be pre-080
- "                    \n"
- |2
                      scribed to the improvement of the human species. Observations
- |2
                      of various races of lower animals had demonstrated to Condorcet's
- |2
                      satisfaction, long before Darwin, that improvement in physical faculties
- |2
                      could be transmitted from one generation to the next. Human beings, he
- |2
                      reasoned, could also pass on to their progeny that part of their physical
- |2
                      organism on which their intelligence, mental energy, and moral
- |2
                      sensibility depend, and proper education could bring about
- |2
                      modification and unlimited improvement of these qualities.
- |2
                  In England after Bacon's initial attack on authority in science, the debate
- |2
                      shifted to literary theory. Most late seventeenth-century literary critics
- |2
                      limited them- selves to discussing the
- |2
                      Aristotelian rules without mentioning the Stagirite's outmoded science.
- |2
                      Dryden, for example, constantly vacillated between adhering to the
- |2
                      rules and violating them. He admired Shake-
- |2
                      speare, but condemned him by the rules; he praised Milton, but
- |2
                      placed Homer and Vergil higher. In open- ing a
- |2
                      complimentary address to his “Honour'd Friend Dr.
- |2
                      Charleton” (1663), however, he declared,
- "                        \n"
- |2
                              The longest Tyranny that ever sway'dWas that wherein our Ancestors betray'dTheir free-born Reason to the Stagirite.
- |2
                       One of the few Restoration critics unequivocally to repudiate slavish
- |2
                      obeisance to the ancients was Charles Gildon, who in Miscellaneous Letters and Essays (1694) drew the parallel with
- |2
                      scientific knowledge. He con- sidered it
- |2
                      beyond doubt that the Greeks were far behind the moderns in physics and
- |2
                      other sciences, which for the ancients “chiefly consisted in
- |2
                      words.” Since authority had been for many years considered
- |2
                      as a deterrent to scientific inquiry he could see no reason why his
- |2
                      contemporaries not only continued to accept it but blindly followed it in
- |2
                      poetry “since 'tis perhaps almost as prejudicial to our
- |2
                      imitation of Nature in This, as to our discovery of it in the
- |2
                      Other.”
- |2
                  The French had debated the relative merits of the French language and the
- |2
                      classical ones, the moderns unequivocally affirming the superiority of
- |2
                      their own tongue. The English Restoration critics, however, accepted
- |2
                      the theory that English had been a barbarous language until their own
- |2
                      times, and even the most vigorous moderns in England granted the
- |2
                      preference to classical idioms. Addison went so far as to assert in
- |2
                      the Spectator (No. 417) that if “Paradise Lost falls short of the Aeneid or Iliad, it proceeds from the
- |2
                      fault of the language in which it is written.... So divine a poem in
- |2
                      English is like a stately palace built of brick.” Later David
- |2
                      Hume suggested that if “Waller had been born in Rome during the
- |2
                      reign of Tiberius, his first productions had been despised, when compared
- |2
                      to the
- |2
                       finished odes of Horace” (“Of the Rise and
- |2
                      Progress of the Arts and Sciences” [1742]).
- |2
                  In England, the formal controversy broke out in full force in 1690 when Sir
- |2
                      William Temple published An Essay upon Ancient and Modern
- |2
                          Learning, asserting the superiority of the ancients in every area
- |2
                      and deny- ing that the moderns profit from their
- |2
                      inheritance. According to his argument, learning which is derived may
- |2
                      weaken invention and dilute genius. “So a Man that only
- |2
                      Translates, shall never be a Poet, nor a Painter that only copies, nor a
- |2
                      Swimmer that swims always with Bladders.” A few pages later he
- |2
                      inconsistently demolished this argument by attributing the revival of
- |2
                      learning in the modern world to the restoration of Greek and pure Latin
- |2
                      after the Middle Ages.
- |2
                  Temple adapted the single man metaphor to his purpose by imagining a strong
- |2
                      and vigorous man who should at the age of thirty fall ill and decline
- |2
                      until sixty when he should recover and then be more vigor- ous than most men of this age. Although it could be
- |2
                      said that he had grown more in strength during the ten years from 60 to 70
- |2
                      than at any other period, he had still not acquired more strength and vigor
- |2
                      than he had possessed at the age of thirty. Temple similarly
- |2
                      interpreted the giant-dwarf image to the detriment of the moderns. As
- |2
                      Temple viewed it, the dwarf, despite his advantageous position, sees less
- |2
                      than the giant if he is naturally shorter-sighted, if he is less
- |2
                      observant, or if he is dazzled by height.
- |2
                  By speculating on the possibility that our ancients had their own ancients
- |2
                      with a period of intellectual stagnation intervening between them and their
- |2
                          fore- runners, a period comparable to
- |2
                      the Middle Ages, Temple introduced a cyclical theory of history
- |2
                      refuting the idea of progress. According to his reasoning, the arts
- |2
                      and sciences came to the West from India and perhaps ultimately from China.
- |2
                      For information to support this theory—although not the theory
- |2
                      itself— Temple relied upon two major sources, Thomas
- |2
                      Burnet's Telluris theoria sacra (Sacred Theory of the Earth, 1681-89) and John Nieuhoff's Voyages and Travels into Brasil (1682). The cyclical
- |2
                      theory itself was current in the Renaissance and had been refuted by
- |2
                      Bacon.
- |2
                  William Wotton answered Temple in Reflections upon Ancient
- |2
                          and Modern Learning (1694), a lengthy treatise, covering all
- |2
                      phases of the arts and sciences, which draws heavily upon Perrault for the
- |2
                      arts and on the defenders of the Royal Society for the sciences. Quite
- |2
                      moderate in his advocacy of the moderns, Wotton refused to follow
- |2
                      Fontenelle in claiming supe- riority for his
- |2
                      own times in oratory and the arts. With impressive logic he observed that
- |2
                      values in the arts are based upon opinion and are subject to debate;081
- |2
                       whereas values in the sciences are objective and may be
- |2
                      ascertained by comparison. In the second edition of his Reflections (1697), Wotton added an appendix by a noted scholar,
- |2
                      Richard Bentley, who shifted the controversy to the area of philological
- |2
                      scholarship.
- |2
                  Bentley used his linguistic learning to prove that the Greek works of
- |2
                      Phalaris and Aesop, which Temple had extolled as ancients were spurious and
- |2
                      really composi- tions of modern times.
- |2
                      Charles Boyle joined the fray against Bentley, and finally Swift, as a
- |2
                      partisan of Temple and the ancients, produced a masterful satire on
- |2
                      the entire controversy, The Battle of the Books
- |2
                      (1704). Swift's mock epic in prose casts the books in St. James Library
- |2
                      arrayed in two armies, Moderns and Ancients, disputing a plot of ground on
- |2
                      Mount Parnas- sus. The spirit of the work is
- |2
                      succinctly conveyed by one of its mock-epic conventions: the episode of
- |2
                      the spider and the bee. The two insects, representing Mod- erns and Ancients respectively, argue over which of
- |2
                      the two is regarded by the outside world as the superior creature. The
- |2
                      spider affirms that the bee is a plunderer of nature, stealing from every
- |2
                      variety of flower; whereas the spider himself is a domestic animal erect- ing his dwelling entirely through his own
- |2
                      efforts and with materials extracted from his own person. The bee
- |2
                      admits ranging over field and garden, but asserts that his collecting of
- |2
                      nectar does no harm to the flowers he visits; whereas the spider pours out
- |2
                      poison from his breast to spin his web, which perpetually gathers dirt
- |2
                      and sweepings. Aesop, who is chosen to moderate the dispute, decides in
- |2
                      favor of the bee, whom he associates with himself as an Ancient.
- "                \n"
- |2
                      Whatever we have got, has been by infinite labour and search, and
- |2
                          ranging through every corner of nature; the difference is that, instead
- |2
                          of dirt and poison, we have rather chosen to fill our hives with honey
- |2
                          and wax, thus furnishing mankind with the two noblest of things, which
- |2
                          are sweetness and light.
- "                \n"
- |2
                  Bacon had preceded Swift in the image of the spider and Ben Jonson in the
- |2
                      image of the bee, and Temple had vastly extended the latter in an essay Of Poetry (1690). Matthew Arnold later adopted the
- |2
                      metaphor “sweetness and light” as the symbol of
- |2
                      classical culture in a famous essay defending it, Culture
- |2
                          and Anarchy (1869).
- |2
                  Diderot, a moderate in the controversy, allegorized the quarrel of ancients
- |2
                      and moderns somewhat in the vein of the episode of the spider and the bee
- |2
                      in a digression inserted in a licentious novel written for the
- |2
                      amusement of his mistress, Les Bijoux indiscrets
- |2
                      (1748). One of the characters in a dream finds himself accom- panied by the Goddess Minerva in a
- |2
                      gallery of statues and books symbolizing the ancients. A crowd of men
- |2
                       burn incense and adorn the statues with garlands, at the same
- |2
                      time abusing those of their number who fail to bow profoundly enough before
- |2
                      the statues. These are succeeded by a horde of pygmies, who hack at
- |2
                      the statues and try to tear them apart. Minerva explains that this
- |2
                      quarrel has been going on for a long time, and always to the disadvantage
- |2
                      of the pygmies. The statues run some risk of being tarnished by the
- |2
                      incense of the worshippers, she explains, but the efforts of the
- |2
                      pygmies to destroy them only make them more bril-
- |2
                          liant.
- |2
                  Swift, in a companion piece to his Battle of the Books, A
- |2
                          Tale of the Tub (1704), ironically pointed to Homer's gross
- |2
                      ignorance of the laws of England and the doctrines of the Anglican Church
- |2
                      as a means of repudiating the moderns' method of judging Homer by the
- |2
                      standards of a later and more sophisticated age than his. Similarly he
- |2
                      ridiculed the moderns as critics whose art consisted merely in the
- |2
                      discovering and collecting of faults. “Their imaginations are so
- |2
                      entirely possessed and replete with the defects of other
- |2
                      pens,” he charged, “that the very quintessence of
- |2
                      what is bad does of necessity distil into their own.”
- |2
                  The method of subjecting Homer to the test of verisimilitude and good taste
- |2
                      was applied in earnest by La Motte and Terrasson. The former condemned
- |2
                      such “low” images as Achilles' asking Thetis to
- |2
                      remove the flies from the wounds of Patroclus; the latter found fault
- |2
                      because the Iliad does not conform to rational
- |2
                      principles of stylistic organization; because the action does not adhere to
- |2
                      the theme of the work; and because Agamemnon commits capital crimes against
- |2
                      religion and justice. The strong implication of both La Motte and
- |2
                      Terrasson was that Homer was as much a barbar-
- |2
                      ian as a poet. The principle argument of La Motte was that Homer
- |2
                      must be subjected to the judgment of reason and not accepted as the voice
- |2
                      of authority. In his opinion, the only pleasures which Homer provides
- |2
                      are those based on novelty, on antiquarianism, on re-
- |2
                          spect for authority, and on prejudice. None of these have any
- |2
                      relation to reason, the single quality on which aesthetic appreciation
- |2
                      should be based (Discours sur
- |2
                      Homère, 1714). La Motte admitted that it was illogical
- |2
                      to attack Homer for not conforming to the dignity of later ages. But he
- |2
                      insisted that criticism had the right to condemn Homeric times for their
- |2
                      barbarousness and to indicate that the description of them in the Iliad appeared disagreeable to the more fastidious
- |2
                      standards of later ages.
- |2
                  In 1716, Sir Richard Blackmore published “An Ac- count of the present controversy concerning Homer'sIliad,” in which he also refused to submit to
- |2
                      the au- thority of ancient writers
- |2
                      “unless they were supported by Reason.” He condemned
- |2
                      the ludicrousness of rivers082
- |2
                       making speeches and horses shedding tears and labelled the
- |2
                      manners and behavior of the pagan Gods a re-
- |2
                      proach to human nature. Yet he suggested that Féne- lon's highly praised modern prose epic, Télémaque, had many worse faults
- |2
                      than the Iliad, particularly in the author's
- |2
                      introducing heathen machines and having Grecian pagans speak in the manner
- |2
                      of Jews, Egyp- tians, and Chaldeans.
- |2
                  Pope in An Essay on Criticism (1711), however,
- |2
                      returned to an almost unanswerable defense of the alleged blemishes in
- |2
                      Homer—the argument of the French critics that they were
- |2
                      intentional—designed to provide variety and to present his most
- |2
                      sublime pas- sages in relief.

                  This is a couplet based on Horace's The Art of Poetry
- |2
                      (lines 359-60), but Pope's defense is stronger than Horace's. The latter
- |2
                      merely suggests that soporific passages may be condoned in a poem which is
- |2
                      very long.
- |2
                  The contention in England over the age of the writ-
- |2
                          ings of Aesop and Phalaris, which was waged on lin- guistic grounds, had its counterpart in France in disa- greements over the theory of
- |2
                      translation. Madame Dacier in the Preface to her translation of the Iliad (1711), argued that the more sublime and
- |2
                      beautiful a work is in the original, the more it loses in translation.
- |2
                      No writer suffers as much as Homer does, for it is impossible in French to
- |2
                      communicate the harmony, nobility, and majesty of his expressions.
- |2
                      Characterizing the French language as timid and circumspect because of
- |2
                      its formality and blind adherence to custom, she condemned it for lacking
- |2
                      the boldness and liberty necessary to reveal the beauties of Homer.
- |2
                      Although she was a confirmed classicist, Mme Dacier, in defend- ing Homer, anticipated by a century the
- |2
                      linguistic arguments of the romanticists which were based on freedom
- |2
                      from restraint. Of Lucretius she remarked that his philosophy and
- |2
                      principles were absurd and false, but that the verses in which they were
- |2
                      expressed would charm every ear by their beauty and harmony.
- |2
                  Abbé La Motte replied in his Discours sur
- |2
                          Homère (1714) that no one in the modern world could
- |2
                      know the dead languages well enough to appreciate their nuances and
- |2
                      beauties. Those who prided themselves on understanding the beauties and
- |2
                      negligences of Homer, that is, the bold strokes which his admirers
- |2
                      praised him for, could have only an approximate knowledge of ancient Greek.
- |2
                      These critics vaunted themselves for possessing knowledge of a
- |2
                      language which they understood only partially and imperfectly.
- |2
                       La Motte went even further and declared that the French
- |2
                      language was the equal of Greek in beauty of expression. He found examples
- |2
                      to illustrate its clarity in history, sublimity in panegyric, saltiness in
- |2
                      satire, dignity in tragedy, naiveté in fable, and tenderness
- |2
                      in opera. Each language, he maintained, has utilitarian communication
- |2
                      as its function, and harmony and sonority are only secondary. It is only
- |2
                      because French has kept itself within the limits of good sense and
- |2
                      clarity that it can be reproached for lacking boldness. Audacious and
- |2
                      daring terms exist in French speech, but if they should ever become
- |2
                      commonplace, French would become degenerate and corrupt. It is
- |2
                      precisely the good sense of the French language, La Motte insisted,
- |2
                      which represents its greatest richness.
- |2
                  Because many French men of letters shared La Motte's pride in the French
- |2
                      language, it was possible for the great French seventeenth-century
- |2
                      authors eventually to displace the ancients as classic models in
- |2
                      French culture. In England, the respect for the vernacular did not reach
- |2
                      these heights, and as a result, English neo-classicism never attained the
- |2
                      authority of the French.
- |2
                  Abbé Dubos took an eclectic position in his Critical Reflections on Poetry and Painting (1719), one of
- |2
                      the major documents in the controversy, but on the ques- tion of translation he stood firmly with the
- |2
                      ancients. It is form alone in Homer which gives pleasure, he affirmed,
- |2
                      and therefore Homer must be translated ex-
- |2
                      actly. But Dubos also maintained that no translation can do justice
- |2
                      to the beauty of a poetic original since the rhythm and harmony of
- |2
                      classical verse cannot be rendered in another language. The Aeneid in French is not the same poem as the Aeneid in Latin. Dubos argued, moreover, that those
- |2
                      who cannot read an an- cient poem in the
- |2
                      original must accept the judgment about it of those who can. One cannot
- |2
                      rely on one's own appraisal of a translation no matter how rational
- |2
                      the appraisal may be, since the translation and the original are different
- |2
                      entities. The beauties of a poem are judged by sentiment, not reason, and
- |2
                      “the general agreement of the senses of other men, is next to
- |2
                      the agreement of our own, the most certain means we have of judging
- |2
                      phenomena which are ranked under senti-
- |2
                      ment.”
- |2
                  With these arguments Dubos was opposing those moderns like La Motte, who
- |2
                      considered that the chief value of studying the ancients was to obtain
- |2
                      historical and sociological information and that the purpose of
- |2
                      criticism was to place an author in his philosophical and historical
- |2
                      context. In rejecting sociological criti-
- |2
                      cism, Dubos discounted the need for verisimilitude and historical
- |2
                      accuracy in art. We do not read poetry to look for contradictions, he
- |2
                      affirmed, but for the pleas-083
- "                    \n"
- |2
                      ure of being moved emotionally. Holding that the only purpose
- |2
                      of poetry is to excite sentiments, not to per-
- |2
                      suade the reason, he considered it a matter of indiffer- ence whether a poem be completely contrary to real- ity. In his emphasis on sentiment,
- |2
                      therefore, Dubos entirely abandoned the Cartesian theory of the
- |2
                      advance of knowledge through reason. In his opinion, the greatest
- |2
                      discoveries in science—the compass, the printing press, the
- |2
                      weight of air, the movement of the earth, and the circulation of
- |2
                      blood—came by chance, not by following rational procedures.
- |2
                      Cartesian reason he affirmed produces nothing but absurd theories such
- |2
                      as that of the beast machine. Sentiment and imagina- tion, therefore, are more important for progress,
- |2
                          ac- cording to Dubos, than reason.
- |2
                  The sociological criticism which Dubos opposed could be used, however, to
- |2
                      the advantage of the An- cients.
- |2
                      Fénelon in a Letter on the Activities of the
- |2
                          Academy (1716), suggested that the deformity and crudeness of
- |2
                      religion and the lack of true morality in Homeric times served to make
- |2
                      Homer's artistic achievement all the more admirable by contrast. The
- |2
                      great epic poet had portrayed with superb imagery and verbal power concepts
- |2
                      which in themselves are absurd and shocking. Jean Bovin in his Apology for Homer (1715), made a comparison with
- |2
                      China, which was emerging at that time as a popular theme. What he
- |2
                      enjoyed in reading about China, he said, was Chinese customs.
- |2
                      “If the heroes of the century of Homer do not resemble ours,
- |2
                      this difference should give us pleasure.”
- |2
                  Although Giambattista Vico in Italy wrote his New
- |2
                      Science (Scienza Nuova [1725; 1744]), with
- |2
                      absolutely no reference to the critical dispute raging in France and
- |2
                      England, the fundamental thought of his treatise completely contradicts
- |2
                      those who attributed philo- sophical
- |2
                      discrimination to the ancients. Vico believed that it was fear which first
- |2
                      led men to create gods in their imaginations and that their first form of
- |2
                      expression was poetical. Contrary to all the ancient philosophers,
- |2
                      including Plato and Aristotle, Vico believed that “it was the
- |2
                      deficiency of human reasoning power that gave rise to poetry,”
- |2
                      and he concluded that his discovery of “the origins of poetry
- |2
                      does away with the opinion of the matchless wisdom of the
- |2
                      ancients.”
- |2
                  Addison in the Spectator (No. 160 [1711]), used Homer
- |2
                      as his only example of natural genius in a distinction between the
- |2
                      contributions to humanity which depend upon native inspiration alone and
- |2
                      those which have depended upon accumulated experience. Those in the
- |2
                      first category of genius have “... by the mere Strength of
- |2
                      natural Parts, and without any Assist- ance
- |2
                      of Art of Learning,... produced Works that were the Delight of their own
- |2
                      Times and the Wonder of
- |2
                       Posterity.” The second category, “formed
- |2
                      themselves by Rules, and submitted the Greatness of their natural
- |2
                      Talents to the Corrections and Restraints of Art.” Homer was
- |2
                      Addison's single example of the first class, and Plato, Aristotle, Vergil,
- |2
                      Cicero, Milton, and Bacon of the second. Abbé Dubos converted this
- |2
                      distinction to one between ancients and moderns. He affirmed that the
- |2
                      moderns are undoubtedly more advanced in the sciences, but their
- |2
                      superiority depends on the prior accumulation of a mass of knowledge, not
- |2
                      on genius. Modern reason, therefore, is not really superior to
- |2
                      ancient. In the realm of art, moreover, time and expe- rience are of no value. The high esteem in which
- |2
                      Homer is held, Dubos maintained, is not due to the reign of Aristotle and
- |2
                      should not be reduced because the latter has fallen from favor; instead
- |2
                      Homer's repu- tation is based entirely on the
- |2
                      pleasure which people of all ages have found in his work.
- |2
                  Pope in An Essay on Criticism attempted to blur the
- |2
                      distinction between genius and acquired experience by affirming that to
- |2
                      follow nature and to imitate the ancients is the same thing.
- "                        \n"
- |2
                              Learn for ancient rules a just esteem;To copy nature is to copy them.
- |2
                       Like most classicists, Pope advocated the imitation of the ancients in
- |2
                      order to attain nature. His friend Edward Young, however, in Conjectures on Original Composition (1752),
- |2
                      prescribed the opposite method. Instead of imitating Homer, the poet should
- |2
                      imitate nature: “drink where he drank, at the true Helicon,
- |2
                      that is, at the breast of nature.” Young recognized that in both
- |2
                      science and the arts, the respect for authority inculcated by the ancients
- |2
                      leads simply to imitation of their models and to acceptance of their
- |2
                      beliefs. His theory is summarized by the paradox: “The less
- |2
                      we copy the renowned ancients, we shall resemble them the
- |2
                      more.” A Spanish critic G. M. Jovellanos in an essayOn the Necessity of Uniting the Study of Literature and
- |2
                          the Sciences (1797), took his inspiration directly from Young in
- |2
                      explaining why the moderns with much greater knowledge than the ancients
- |2
                      nevertheless dis- played less genius:
- |2
                      “because the ancients created, and we imitate; because the
- |2
                      ancients studied nature, and we study them. Why do we not follow their
- |2
                      track? And if we wish to equal them, why do we not study as they
- |2
                      did?”
- |2
                  Diderot, however, in a highly-regarded critical essay,Salon de 1767, affirmed that precisely because
- |2
                      the Greeks had based their artistic creation on nature, their work
- |2
                      could never be excelled. “The inviolable laws of Nature must be
- |2
                      executed; Nature does nothing by leaps and bounds, and this is no less true
- |2
                      in the arts than in the cosmos.” Despite the possibility of going084
- |2
                       directly to nature for models and inspiration, Diderot affirmed
- |2
                      that it is impossible for modern artists ever to equal the
- |2
                      ancients—they can only be imitators. Goethe in the section of
- |2
                      his autobiography Poetry and Truth (Dichtung und Wahrheit, 1811-33), devoted to the
- |2
                      “Antique and the Present,” reiterated and supported
- |2
                      this view.
- |2
                  Marivaux in The Mirror (1755) offered an explanation
- |2
                      of the paradox that literary works could be greater in ancient times than
- |2
                      in modern despite the accumulation and proliferation of knowledge in the
- |2
                      modern world. He maintained that ideas and taste are not parallel and,
- |2
                      therefore, do not increase at the same rate. Each gen- eration which comes on the earth adds its own portion
- |2
                      to the stock of ideas, and these never entirely disap- pear: their impression remains indelibly in
- |2
                      humanity. But even though modern times may have a greater accumulation
- |2
                      of ideas than existed in the past, there is unfortunately less of taste.
- |2
                      The augmentation of ideas is an infallible consequence of the duration of
- |2
                      the world, Marivaux concluded, but the art of employing those ideas in
- |2
                      works of the spirit may decline—in which event belles lettres
- |2
                      may sink, criticism and taste disappear. Marivaux concluded, therefore,
- |2
                      that there had never been a period to equal that of the ancients.
- |2
                  Vauvenargues in his Discourse on the Character of Various
- |2
                          Centuries (1745) made a parallel admission that ineffably greater
- |2
                      knowledge is available in modern times than in the past, but he questioned
- |2
                      whether the average man was capable of assimilating or utilizing this
- |2
                      knowledge. As far as Vauvenargues was concerned, that which depends on the
- |2
                      spirit receives no increase from the proliferation of the products of the
- |2
                      intellect, and since taste depends on the spirit, knowledge is being
- |2
                      increased in vain: “our judgment is instructed, but our taste is
- |2
                      not improved.”
- |2
                  Even Turgot, one of the most ardent exponents of perfectibility, conceded
- |2
                      that while the capacity for knowledge of the nature of truth is as infinite
- |2
                      as truth itself, the development of the arts is as limited as man
- |2
                      himself. Poetry, painting, and music have a fixed point determined by
- |2
                      language and by the sensibility of our organs. This fixed point, Turgot
- |2
                      believed, had been attained by the men of the Age of Augustus, who,
- |2
                      therefore, will remain as models for all subsequent generations (Second Discourse... on the Progress of the Human
- |2
                      Mind, 1750).
- |2
                  Abbé Terrasson refused to accept the separation of arts and
- |2
                      sciences as valid in the measurement of human progress, condemning the
- |2
                      division as artificial by means of an original variant of the single-man
- |2
                      image. In a discourse with the pertinent title, Philosophy Applica- ble to all the
- |2
                          objects of the Mind and Reason (1754), he affirmed that such a
- |2
                      separation would perhaps be
- |2
                       applicable to a creature with two souls, but it does not fit
- |2
                      humanity. He maintained, moreover, that infe-
- |2
                      rior as the ancients were in the sciences, they knew more about
- |2
                      them, particularly geometry and astron- omy,
- |2
                      than they knew about the true principles of reason and humanity,
- |2
                      “unique source of the true use of belles-lettres in prose and
- |2
                      poetry.”
- |2
                  The first critic to suggest the possibility that the fine arts may progress,
- |2
                      just as the sciences do, was Edward Young. As part of his campaign against
- |2
                      the principle of imitation in literature, he urged poets not only to
- |2
                      go beyond the ancients in representing nature, but even to go beyond nature
- |2
                      itself and to develop a world of pure imagination. “In the
- |2
                      fairyland of fancy,” he remarked in his Conjectures, “genius may wander wild; there it has
- |2
                      creative power, and may reign arbitrarily over its own empire of
- |2
                      chimeras.” This is the essence of the ultra-modern spirit, and
- |2
                      Young himself recog- nized that it was partly
- |2
                      rant. But he declared unequiv- ocally,
- |2
                      “all arts and sciences are making considerable
- |2
                      advance,” and he did not hesitate to ask, “why may
- |2
                      not poetry go forward with this advancement?”
- |2
                  Condorcet, probably the most ardent “perfectibilian”
- |2
                      of the century, vigorously supported the view that progress occurs in the
- |2
                      fine arts. In his Historical Sketch (1793) he made
- |2
                      an original distinction between “that which belongs really to
- |2
                      the progress of art and that which is due only to the talent of the
- |2
                      artist.” In the past, he contended, critics had judged artists
- |2
                      rather than works, giving rise to the adulation of the ancient authors
- |2
                      and the growth of a cult requiring imitation of the first models. Although
- |2
                      not making any aesthetic comparisons between specific ancient and modern
- |2
                          au- thors, Condorcet affirmed that the arts
- |2
                      are improved by and draw profit from advances in philosophy and
- |2
                      science—either through more precise knowledge of the effects and
- |2
                      powers of these arts themselves or through the destruction of prejudices
- |2
                      against them. Reasoning such as this may have inspired the poet Shelley
- |2
                      to speculate in the Preface to The Revolt of Islam
- |2
                      (1817), that “there may be such a thing as perfectibility
- |2
                      in works of fiction.”
- |2
                  This doctrine of perfectibility is related to the socio- logical criticism of La Motte since both systems
- |2
                      assume that literature is as much a product of society as of
- |2
                      individuals. The concept of the interaction of literature and society
- |2
                      directly opposes all theories of absolute values, including that of the
- |2
                      supremacy of the ancients. Mme de Staël fully developoed the
- |2
                      concept in her pioneer treatise Literature Considered in
- |2
                          Its Relations with Social Institutions (De la
- |2
                          Littérature considerée dans ses rapports avec les
- |2
                          institutions sociales, 1800).
- |2
                  In Spain, ever since Luis Vives in the sixteenth century had used literary
- |2
                      arguments against the doc-085
- "                    \n"
- |2
                      trine of the degeneration of the world, critics in that
- |2
                      country confidently extolled the originality and vigor of Spanish
- |2
                      literature. During the middle of the eight-
- |2
                      eenth century, however, a Dominican priest, Benito Jeronimo Feijoo,
- |2
                      considered to be one of the most progressive as well as prolific minds in
- |2
                      Spain at the time, published an essay “Resurrection of the Arts
- |2
                      and Defense of the Ancients” (1750), taking a moderate
- |2
                      position in the controversy, but leaning toward the side of the ancients.
- |2
                      On the subject of the arts he asked: “What is there in our
- |2
                      century which can compete with the beauties of the poetry and eloquence of
- |2
                      the century of Augustus?” And with respect to the sciences
- |2
                      he affirmed that if the stories told of the intellectual pene- tration of some of the ancients are
- |2
                      true, “certainly one may infer that their physical knowledge was
- |2
                      much superior to all the philosophers of these times.” Two
- |2
                      of his examples of this penetration are revealing: Democritus was able
- |2
                      merely by tasting milk to tell that it came from a black goat which had
- |2
                      been pregnant only once. And the same philosopher, saluting a girl
- |2
                      whom he had greeted the night before Salve virgo,
- |2
                      used the words Salve mulier in the morning;
- |2
                      it was later discovered that she had been violated. Feijoo reflected
- |2
                      the point of view of Temple that the ancients really deserve the credit for
- |2
                      many of the discoveries ascribed to the moderns, including circulation of
- |2
                      the blood, the telescope, printing, and the compass. He insisted
- |2
                      moreover that the first discovery of a principle or art is worthy of more
- |2
                      praise than its subsequent develop- ment by
- |2
                      the moderns.
- |2
                  In France the debate continued on scientific as well as aesthetic grounds.
- |2
                      Father Noël Regnault, in hisAncient Origin of New Physics (L'Origine ancienne de la physique nouvelle [1734]), stressed
- |2
                      the great debt which modern science owes to the ancients and argued
- |2
                      that the improvements of his day would not have been possible without the
- |2
                      ancients. A French Protestant clergyman, living in England, Louis Dutens,
- |2
                      published in 1766 An Inquiry into the Origin of the
- |2
                          Discoveries attributed to the Moderns: Wherein It is Demonstrated,
- |2
                          That our most celebrated Philosophers have, for most part, taken what
- |2
                          they advance from the Works of the Ancients, and that many important
- |2
                          Truths in Religion were known to the Pagan Sages. Considering the
- |2
                      works of his predecessors, Perrault, Fontenelle, Wotton, and Temple as
- |2
                      comprising fine declamation and rhetoric rather than proofs or
- |2
                      demonstrations, Dutens at- tempted to reveal
- |2
                      the enormous share the ancients have had in “modern
- |2
                      discoveries.” He followed Addison and Dubos in distinguishing
- |2
                      between those arts and sciences “which require long experience
- |2
                      and practice to bring them to perfection, and those which depend solely
- |2
                      on talent and genius.” He admitted that the moderns have
- |2
                       brought the former to higher stages of development, and that
- |2
                      the Christian religion has even extended mo-
- |2
                      rality itself. Also in the area of scientific inventions, he
- |2
                      distinguished between the products of genius and philosophy and the
- |2
                      “mere effects of chance, or the lucky hits of some ignorant
- |2
                      artisans.” After including printing, gunpowder, and the compass
- |2
                      in the category of lucky hits he tried to trace to the ancients the
- |2
                      systems of logic and metaphysics of Descartes, Leibniz, Malebranche, and
- |2
                      Locke; Buffon's theories of universal matter, generation, and nutrition:
- |2
                      Newton's theory of colors; Harvey's theory of the circulation of blood;
- |2
                      the plurality of worlds; the motion of the earth around the sun; and
- |2
                      the sexual system of plants. On the subjects of architecture, sculpture,
- |2
                      poetry, eloquence, and his- tory, Dutens took
- |2
                      for granted the preeminence of the ancients, affirming that “The
- |2
                      moderns themselves will not contest with them; on the contrary the height
- |2
                      of their ambition is, to imitate them.” Dutens concluded
- |2
                      that the ancients had preceded or prepared the way for the moderns
- |2
                      “in almost all truths of the greatest importance.”
- |2
                      Supporting the theory of Temple that the ancients had their own ancients,
- |2
                      as well as commenting on the opinion of Perrault that recent discoveries
- |2
                      had been so extensive that there was little left to be learned, he
- |2
                      quoted Seneca concerning the future: “Had even everything been
- |2
                      found out by the ancients, there would still this remain to be done anew,
- |2
                      to put their inven- tions into use and make their knowledge ours” (Epistle 64). Though Dutens' work is today virtually
- |2
                      unknown, it was widely circulated in its own time. John Wesley, for
- |2
                      example, republished it in abridged form in later editions of his Survey of the Wisdom of God in Crea-
- |2
                              tion—a text-book of popular science originally
- |2
                          pub- lished in 1763—which went
- |2
                      through several editions in England and the United States. Summarizing his
- |2
                      own impression, Wesley exclaimed: “Alas! how little new has
- |2
                      been discovered, even by Gassendi, Malebranche, Mr. Locke, or Sir Isaac
- |2
                      Newton! How plain is it, that in philosophy, as well as the course of human
- |2
                      affairs, 'there is nothing new under the sun.'”
- |2
                  A number of replies to this objection of the lack of novelty, which Wesley
- |2
                      was quoting from Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament
- |2
                      (1:9), were already in print. In order to discourage literary imitations,
- |2
                      La Motte ridi- culed the concept that no new
- |2
                      thoughts are possible and that the human mind had already imagined every- thing that could be said. He compared
- |2
                      ideas to the variety in human physiognomies and affirmed that
- |2
                      experience shows that no two men will ever be born who are exactly alike.
- |2
                      In like manner, even though ideas may always follow certain common paths,
- |2
                      there will always be infinite opportunity for original appli- cations (Discourse
- |2
                          on Poetry [1707]). Marivaux in The086
- |2
                           Mirror (1755) made exactly the same comparison and
- |2
                      added as a further analogy that just as man has not discovered all the
- |2
                      forms of which matter is susceptible, he has not exhausted all the ways of
- |2
                      thinking and feeling.
- |2
                  Dubos similarly argued that artists of genius do not use the works of their
- |2
                      predecessors as models, but go directly to nature. “Nature is
- |2
                      more abundant in differ- ent or varied
- |2
                      subjects than the genius of artisans in ways of imitating them.”
- |2
                      Dubos made the original observation, moreover, that particular subjects
- |2
                      are compatible for the talents of particular artists, and that some
- |2
                      subjects remain virtually untouched because no artist has yet discovered
- |2
                      them. Thomas Paine charac-
- |2
                      teristically scoffed in an essay in The
- |2
                          Pennsylvania Magazine (1775) that the notion that “We have found out everything has been the motto of
- |2
                      every age,” and that this species of vanity was stronger among
- |2
                      the ancients than the moderns. Combining chronological and cultural
- |2
                      primitivism, he diverted himself by look- ing
- |2
                      back and imagining “a circle of original Indians haranguing on
- |2
                      the sublime perfection of the age.”
- |2
                  Voltaire associated the quarrel of ancients and mod-
- |2
                          erns with one of the most important scientific projects of the
- |2
                      century, twin expeditions organized by the French Academy of Science to
- |2
                      measure the latitude at the North Pole and at the Equator and thus to
- |2
                      test Newton's hypothesis that the earth is flattened at the poles. In
- |2
                      a congratulatory poem to the scientists (“A Messieurs de
- |2
                      l'Académie des Sciences” [1738]), Voltaire
- |2
                      unequivocally espoused the side of the moderns. Addressing the ancient
- |2
                      Greeks, Voltaire bid them to be ashamed and embarrassed at their poor
- |2
                      performance in contrast to the great exploits of his contemporaries.
- |2
                      “Your century” he declared “is vanquished by
- |2
                      the century in which we are.” According to Voltaire, opin- ion in the past had universally favored the
- |2
                      Greeks, only because it had been in bondage to lies and prejudices. In
- |2
                      a note to his poem, Voltaire reaffirmed the parallel between science and
- |2
                      literature, but his examples reveal his own prejudices. He declared that
- |2
                      two minor French musical tragedies, Alcine and Armide, were worth more than all Greek poetry put
- |2
                      together and that Thales and Pythagoras were not fit to study under
- |2
                      Newton. “But the first-comers seized the Temple of Glory,
- |2
                      time confirmed their claim, and the late-comers find the area
- |2
                      occupied.” In one of his tales, “The World as It
- |2
                      is” (1746) Voltaire insisted that the first efforts in
- |2
                      every art are always crude despite the preference which critics
- |2
                      stubbornly accord to the ancients over the mod-
- |2
                      erns. In his seminal history The Century of Louis
- |2
                      XIV (1752), he unequivocally asserted “the prodigious su- periority of our century over the
- |2
                      ancients” and added that at least as far as philosophy is
- |2
                      concerned the
- |2
                       dispute is definitely decided in favor of the moderns. In a
- |2
                      later dialogue bearing the title Ancients and
- |2
                      Moderns (1765), Voltaire retreated to the more moder- ate position of Fontenelle that the controversy
- |2
                      could best be resolved by granting that the modern world had
- |2
                      discovered new laws of physics, but had not improved upon the ancients'
- |2
                      rules of eloquence.
- |2
                  Oliver Goldsmith maintained that there exists no real basis of comparison
- |2
                      between ancients and moderns, calling in question, in his An Enquiry into the Present State of Polite Learning (1759), the
- |2
                      commonplace that nature is always the same. According to Goldsmith,
- |2
                      both ancients and moderns imitated nature as they found it, but nature was
- |2
                      different for each culture. Both ancients and moderns should then be
- |2
                      considered excel- lent in their separate
- |2
                      imitations. Homer would have been despised by the Greeks if he had written
- |2
                      like Milton, and Milton would have been ridiculous if he had adopted
- |2
                      Homer's religion. One should not con- demn
- |2
                      Plautus for failing to depict characters like Molière's, nor the
- |2
                      reverse. To do so would be as absurd as condemning “a geographer
- |2
                      for not introducing more rivers, or promontories, into a country, than
- |2
                      nature had given it; or the natural historian, for not enlivening his
- |2
                      description of a dead landscape with a torrent, cataract, or a
- |2
                      volcano.”
- |2
                  For Herder in Germany, it was not precisely nature which changes from one
- |2
                      chronological period to an- other, but national
- |2
                      cultures which differ one from another. Classical art he described, in an
- |2
                      essay Homer und Ossian (1795), as an
- |2
                      expression of national, cultural and social conditions which no longer
- |2
                      exist in the modern world. Imitations of ancient art, therefore, are
- |2
                      false and without soul since they do not express the emotions of the
- |2
                      artist. According to Herder, a German poet of the eighteenth century cannot
- |2
                      create ancient art just as an apple tree cannot bear pears.
- |2
                  Herder argued moreover in his Philosophy of the History of
- |2
                          the Development of Mankind (Philosophie der
- |2
                          Geschichte zur Bildung der Menschheit [1774]) that just as
- |2
                      there exists no “absolute” human being, but all
- |2
                      members of the human race differ one from another, there can be no one
- |2
                      historical form of culture—the ancient or any
- |2
                      other—which can be made as an “abso- lute ideal.” The classic norm forced the poet
- |2
                      to be an imitator, not a creator. Herder, like Goldsmith, was a
- |2
                      moderate. He did not try to elevate either the ancient or the modern world
- |2
                      over the other, but he agreed with virtually all of his predecessors on the
- |2
                      side of the moderns that the artist should follow his own inspira- tion or native talent rather than the
- |2
                      standards or models of the past.
- |2
                  New impetus for studying and understanding the ancients came during the
- |2
                      second half of the eighteenth087
- |2
                       century in the wake of extensive excavations and archeological
- |2
                      investigations, which led to a Greek Revival in art and architecture. The
- |2
                      movement was most significant in Germany, giving rise to Winckel- mann's esthetic treatise, Thoughts concerning the Imi-
- |2
                          tation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture (1755), in
- |2
                      which he emphasized the artistic importance of simplicity, not merely that
- |2
                      of nature, but that of the absolute or ideal. Schiller in the sixth of his
- |2
                          Letters concerning the Esthetic Education of
- |2
                      Mankind (1795) analyzed the civilization of the ancient Greeks
- |2
                      and concluded that the form of culture it represented had then
- |2
                      attained maximum development. Continued progress in culture, he felt, had
- |2
                      to be based upon a split between intellect and feeling. In his most impor- tant critical work, On
- |2
                          Naive and Sentimental Poetry (Über
- |2
                          naive und sentimentalische Dichtung [1795-96]), he
- |2
                      reformulated “the old Ancient-Modern debate by a new
- |2
                      dichotomy,” in which he endeavored to justify his own art and
- |2
                      modern art in general (René Wellek,History of Modern Criticism, I, 234). In Schiller's
- |2
                      usage, naive refers to the mode of expression of the ancients based
- |2
                      upon instantaneous reaction to primitive man-
- |2
                      ners and the simplicity of nature; sentimental refers to the mode of
- |2
                      expression of the moderns based upon an emotional attitude toward nature
- |2
                      and manners, reconstructed in tranquility. The ancients portray only
- |2
                      that which is happening at the moment; the moderns portray strong feelings
- |2
                      conditioned by moral concepts and calm reflection. The moderns, ineffably
- |2
                      below the ancients in everything related to nature, still have a
- |2
                      better understanding of it. The ancients had conformed to nature, but the
- |2
                      moderns in sophisticated society, by controlling nature, oppose it.
- |2
                      Schiller granted the su- periority of the
- |2
                      ancients in the plastic arts, where observation is paramount, but found the
- |2
                      moderns su- perior in all areas based upon
- |2
                      ideas where reflection is supreme.

               Dictionary of the History of IdeasThe idea of progress, finding expression in many
- |2
                      forms and levels, was most vociferously discussed during the
- |2
                      eighteenth century in the literary quarrel of the an-
- |2
                          cients and moderns, which embraced questions of au- thority, antiquarianism, and the new experimental sci- ence. The attack on authority in science and
- |2
                      literary criticism first foreshadowed and later paralleled the
- |2
                      challenging of authority in religion and politics, which developed during
- |2
                      the Enlightenment in systems of deism and political democracy.Most of the arguments in favor of modern learning as opposed to ancient grew
- |2
                      out of the efforts of Descartes and Bacon to persuade their respective
- |2
                      countrymen to adopt a new method of judging and seeking truth. Both
- |2
                      rejected the authority of the an- cients in
- |2
                      scientific questions—Bacon as part of his inductive method and
- |2
                      Descartes as part of his system of “methodical
- |2
                      doubt.” Descartes asserted in the first article, The Passions of the Mind (1649):What the ancients have taught is so scanty and for the most part so
- |2
                          lacking in credibility that I may not hope for any kind of approach
- |2
                          toward truth except by rejecting all the paths which they have
- |2
                          followed.Aristotle, was first attacked and discredited in the realm of science, and
- |2
                      then disputed in literature. Homer developed as another natural target.
- |2
                      Critics assumed that if they could sufficiently tarnish his image,
- |2
                      they would succeed in proving the superiority of the modern age.Abbé Pons in France, for example, praised Descartes for subjecting
- |2
                      the scientific system of Aristotle to rigid scrutiny and exposing the
- |2
                      latter's deviations from truth. Then he pointed to the parallel between the
- |2
                      long reign of Aristotle in science and that of Homer in literature. He
- |2
                      argued in his Letter on the “Iliad” of La Motte (Lettre sur “l'Iliade” de la Motte,
- |2
                      1714) that the rejec- tion of Aristotle
- |2
                      furnished a presentiment of the immi- nent fall
- |2
                      of Homer. Two years later, the English poetEven after Aristotle had been dethroned in the realm of science, it remained
- |2
                      difficult to budge Homer from his pedestal. Critical opinion in the late
- |2
                      seventeenth century generally agreed with Boileau that since Homer had
- |2
                      been constantly admired and followed throughout the ages, he should always
- |2
                      continue to be admired and imitated. The abbé Terrasson,
- |2
                      however, in his Critical Dissertation on the
- |2
                          “Iliad” (Dissertation
- |2
                          critique sur “l'Iliade,” 1715) revolted against
- |2
                      this logic. For him, literary work should not be judged according to
- |2
                      the reputation it had enjoyed in the past, but ac-
- |2
                          cording to its conformity to reason and nature. Literary
- |2
                      criticism, according to Terrasson, should adopt the philosophic spirit
- |2
                      which had been responsible for progress in the natural sciences,
- |2
                      acknowledging the superiority of “reason which leads us to
- |2
                      attribute each phenomenon to its proper and natural principle,”
- |2
                          in- dependent of the opinion of other
- |2
                      men. Blackmore said essentially the same:It's clear, that Aristotle form'd all his Axioms and
- |2
                          Doctrines in Poetry, from the Patterns of Homer and other Greek
- |2
                          Writers; and without assigning any Reason of his Positions. ... But it
- |2
                          is not the Authority of the greatest Masters, but solid and convincing
- |2
                          Evidence, that must engage our Belief.The debate concerned not only the two separate issues of which age possessed
- |2
                      greater genius or mental powers and which possessed greater knowledge,
- |2
                      but also a far more important one; did an increase of knowledge mean
- |2
                      progress? This is another way of asking whether people are actually happier
- |2
                      in the modern world. The partisans of the ancients were obviously
- |2
                      accepting a form of cultural primitivism. Some men who did not profess any
- |2
                      form of primitivism, nevertheless considered the new science as
- |2
                      nothing more than an interesting development, which did nothing to
- |2
                      change man's nature or to make him any happier. Others justified their
- |2
                      indifference to the ques- tion by appealing to
- |2
                      the commonplace observation of the century—that human nature
- |2
                      never changes. Lord Chesterfield, for example, prided himself on the dis- covery “that nature was the same
- |2
                      three thousand years ago as it is at present; that men were but men
- |2
                      then as well as now.” He was willing to grant that modes and
- |2
                      customs often vary, but insisted that “human nature is always
- |2
                      the same.” Taking a common- place
- |2
                      metaphor, originally introduced by Montaigne, he argued in a letter to his
- |2
                      son, 7 February 1749, that there is no more reason to assume that men were
- |2
                       better, braver, or wiser in ancient times than “to sup- pose that the animals or vegetables were
- |2
                      better then than they are now.” La Bruyère in another
- |2
                      famous analogy, from his Caractères (1687),
- |2
                      compared authors who espoused the side of the moderns to robust
- |2
                      infants who suck the nourishing milk of their nurses and then revolt
- |2
                      and beat them.The major disputants in the quarrel between ancients and moderns made use of
- |2
                      three primary metaphorical expressions which passed from pen to pen

                      without acknowledgment: (1) the paradox that modern men are the real
- |2
                      ancients; (2) the image of the human race as a single man; and (3) the
- |2
                      image of a giant with a dwarf on his shoulders.(1) The paradox concerning the antiquity of modern men derives from Bacon,
- |2
                      who expressed it in Latin,Antiquitas saeculi juventus mundi
- |2
                      (“Ancient times are the youth of the world”). Our
- |2
                      times then are the an- cient times
- |2
                      “when the world is ancient and not those which we account
- |2
                          ordine retrogrado by a computation
- |2
                      backward from ourselves.” The same paradox may be found in
- |2
                      Descartes, Pascal, and Malebranche. TheEncyclopédie, in the article,
- |2
                          “Anciens,” called it
- |2
                      an ingenious sophism, equivalent to the pleasantry, le monde est si vieux qu'il radote (“the world is
- |2
                      so old it drivels”). In the last decade of the eighteenth
- |2
                      century, Thomas Paine gave the argument a political twist inThe Rights of Man (1791) in order to discredit
- |2
                      Burke's concept of prescription. The only reason for studying
- |2
                      governments in the ancient world, as far as Paine was concerned, was to
- |2
                      profit by their errors and to perceive later improvements by contrast.
- |2
                      “Those who lived a hundred or a thousand years ago,”
- |2
                      Paine affirmed, “were then moderns as we are now.”(2) The image of the human race as a single man compared the life span of
- |2
                      the entire human race to one man's progress from cradle to grave. It exists
- |2
                      in both Roger Bacon and Francis Bacon and in all the major
- |2
                      participants in the ancient-moderns dispute. The figure could be used by
- |2
                      one side to show that the race was already approaching senility, and by the
- |2
                      other side to characterize the ancients as infants.(3) The giant-dwarf image represents the ancients as giants supporting the
- |2
                      moderns as dwarfs on their shoulders so that the latter may have an
- |2
                      advantageous view of nature. The metaphor figured prominently during
- |2
                      the Renaissance in the writing of the Spaniard, Juan Luis Vives
- |2
                      (1492-1540), and in Ben Jonson (1572-1637), and was reintroduced by
- |2
                      Fontenelle. This image may also be used to support either side of the
- |2
                      controversy: the ancients interpreted the puny figure of the modern dwarf
- |2
                      as a sign of decay, but the mod- erns considered
- |2
                      his advantageous position as a symbol of the superior knowledge of modern
- |2
                      times.The debate was introduced into the literary realm by Alessandro Tassoni in
- |2
                      the last of his Ten Books of Miscellaneous Thoughts
- |2
                          (Dieci libri di pensieri diversi [1620]).
- |2
                      In theory he seemed to favor the ancients by attacking the argument that
- |2
                      knowledge is cumulative and that, therefore, it must always be the latest
- |2
                          gener- ation which has the greatest
- |2
                      amount of it. Such reason- ing, he affirmed,
- |2
                      would hold only if study and research were continuously carried on by
- |2
                      outstanding minds, but in actuality learning has frequently been
- |2
                      captured by hostile forces or inferior intellects and thus learning
- |2
                      may decline instead of advance. In his pragmatic sur-
- |2
                          vey of the concrete achievements of civilization, how- ever, Tassoni acknowledged the superiority of the
- |2
                      moderns. It follows from Tassoni's arguments that progress does not need to
- |2
                      take place in a straight line, but it may occur in spurts and jumps; some
- |2
                      areas may go forward while others go backwards, and there may even be
- |2
                      occasional periods of total retrogression.In France, the preliminary skirmishes began in 1635, when a minor poet,
- |2
                      Boisrobert, who had probably read Tassoni in translation, attacked the
- |2
                      ancients before the French Academy. He was followed by Desmarets de
- |2
                      Saint-Sorlin who argued passionately in his Discourse to
- |2
                          Prove That Only Christian Subjects are Appropriate to Heroic
- |2
                      Poetry (Discours pour prouver que les sujets
- |2
                          chrétiens sont seuls propres à la poésie
- |2
                          héroïque [1673]), that Christian miracles
- |2
                      are far superior to pagan my- thology as
- |2
                      subjects for heroic poetry. Although the dispute over the use of Christian
- |2
                      subject matter in the epic tradition developed in England as a
- |2
                      separate contest, completely independent of that between the ancients
- |2
                      and moderns, the two contests are themati-
- |2
                      cally related. The advocates of Christian poetry took up their
- |2
                      position with the moderns, for the substitution of Christian materials for
- |2
                      the classical deities represents a triumph of the contemporary world over
- |2
                      the past. Desmarets maintained that the epic poet must be not only a
- |2
                      story-teller, but also an authority on “history, geography,
- |2
                      astronomy, matters of nature, logic, ethics, rhetoric, fables, agriculture,
- |2
                      architecture, painting, sculpture, perspective, and music.” This
- |2
                      requirement of extensive knowledge for the epic poet obviously put the
- |2
                      ancients at a great disadvantage. John Dryden similarly required the epic
- |2
                      poet to combine the “natu- ral
- |2
                      endowments, of a large invention, a ripe judgment, and a strong
- |2
                      memory” with “the knowledge of liberal arts and
- |2
                      sciences, and particularly moral philosophy, the mathematics, geography,
- |2
                      and history.”Carrying the controversy to the completely different area of linguistics,
- |2
                      François Charpentier in 1683 pub-
- |2
                      lished a treatise, On the Excellence of the French
- |2
                              Lan- guage (De
- |2
                          l'Excellence de la langue française), arguing that
- |2
                      modern French rather than the classical languages
- |2
                       should be the medium for inscriptions on public monu- ments. Taking a position which Alexander
- |2
                      Pope was to express a generation later in his satires, (First Epistle of the Second Book of Horace [1737]), and
- |2
                      Marivaux in his Miroir (XI [1755]), Charpentier
- |2
                      maintained that those who expressed a preference for the ancients did
- |2
                      so because they were jealous of contemporary authors.In 1687 Charles Perrault united literary and scien-
- |2
                          tific considerations in a poem exalting his own times,The Century of Louis XIV (Le
- |2
                          Siècle de Louis le Grand) which he read before the
- |2
                      Academy. The an- cients were great in their
- |2
                      way, he admitted, but still had all the limitations of human beings. Homer
- |2
                      had written under the disadvantages of living in a primitive society
- |2
                      and, therefore, had fallen into various errors which he could have avoided
- |2
                      had he written in the modern world. Without qualification Perrault
- |2
                      affirmed that the ancient authorities in science and history,
- |2
                      Aristotle and Herodotus, had already been discredited. As symbols of the
- |2
                      scientific superiority of the moderns, Perrault featured in his poem a
- |2
                      detailed description of the telescope and microscope. We may find
- |2
                      close parallels to these passages in many French and English poems as
- |2
                      well as in a Russian Georgic poem, Letter on the Use of
- |2
                          Glass (1752) by M. V. Lomonosov.Perrault further developed his notions in a prose dialogue, Parallels between Ancients and Moderns (1688-96),
- |2
                      not actually intended to show parallels, but instead differences and
- |2
                      distinctions. For the gathering of ammunition against the ancients, he
- |2
                      appealed to the astronomer Huygens, who supplied him with informa- tion concerning the advance of
- |2
                      science. On the literary side Perrault repeated his charge that Homer
- |2
                      and Vergil had been guilty of an infinite number of errors because
- |2
                      they lacked knowledge which came to light in later times. As one example of
- |2
                      Homer's great defi- ciencies, his lack of
- |2
                      verisimilitude, Perrault pointed to the victory of Ulysses and three of his
- |2
                      friends over 108 suitors of Penelope: the four warriors surmounting
- |2
                      impossible odds to kill their foes without taking them by surprise, while
- |2
                      Ulysses in the midst of the fray delivered a long moral discourse.Mme Dacier answered the objections to the errors and implausibilities of the
- |2
                      ancients by affirming that whatever reproaches are made against Homer may
- |2
                      be made equally against the Old Testament. In the preface to her
- |2
                      translation of the Iliad (1711) she confined the
- |2
                      argument to social customs rather than to scientific knowledge. The epic
- |2
                      poet must portray customs and behavior exactly as they are in his own
- |2
                      times; otherwise his imitation of nature will be false and his heroes
- |2
                      no more credible than heroes of romances. “In a word, the
- |2
                      poem imitates what exists and not that which has come into being only after
- |2
                      it.” Since Homer could notIn 1688 Fontenelle published a volume of pastoral poetry in which he
- |2
                      inserted a Digression sur les anciens et les
- |2
                      modernes. Here he maintained that the question of the preeminence
- |2
                      of ancients or moderns may be reduced to a consideration of whether the
- |2
                      trees of former times were taller than those growing at present, a
- |2
                      problem which had been presented by Montaigne in the Apologie de Raymond Sebond. This is a phase of the related
- |2
                      theological doctrine of the degeneration of the world. Fontenelle argued
- |2
                      that if biological differences exist in man as well as in plants,
- |2
                      these differences are caused by geography and climate, not by
- |2
                      chronology. And since the climate is essentially the same in Greece, Italy,
- |2
                      and France, all human beings, including the ancients and moderns, Greeks,
- |2
                      Romans, and French, are biologically equal. A scientist of mod- ern times, he affirmed, because of the
- |2
                      accumulation of information knows ten times more than one of the times
- |2
                      of Augustus, and he has ten times greater facility in acquiring his
- |2
                      knowledge. The great reputation of the ancients is based upon prejudice and
- |2
                      tradition. In literature, the names of the ancients sound better to
- |2
                      our ears merely because they are Greek and Latin. Before Fontenelle,
- |2
                      eloquence and poetry had been the main subjects of contention, but for him
- |2
                      they counted less than the sciences. He admitted that the ancients
- |2
                      could theoretically have attained perfection in elo-
- |2
                          quence and poetry, but granted that they had actually attained
- |2
                      it only in the former. Critics were accustomed to consider both Greeks and
- |2
                      Romans as ancients, but Fontenelle affirmed that in a relative sense the
- |2
                      Romans were moderns. In literary merit, he placed Cicero over
- |2
                      Demosthenes, Vergil over both Theocritus and Homer, Horace over Pindar, and
- |2
                      Livy over the Greek histori- ans. And he
- |2
                      asserted for his contemporaries a further claim to
- |2
                      superiority—that they had developed new literary forms like the
- |2
                      novel, and the lettres galantes which had not
- |2
                      existed in antiquity.Fontenelle also touched on the faults of Homer, which the latter's admirers
- |2
                      had attempted to exonerate or vindicate under the plea of poetic license.
- |2
                      Homer, for example, indiscriminately mingled as many as five dialects
- |2
                      in a single line, a process equivalent to a French poet's blending the
- |2
                      dialects of Picardy, Gas- cony, Normandy, and
- |2
                      Brittany with ordinary French. Both Perrault and Fontenelle used the single
- |2
                      man image, but the latter refused to carry the comparison to its
- |2
                      logical end, resolutely affirming that the human race would never
- |2
                      degenerate into senility.Fontenelle, nevertheless, had no illusions concerning the intrinsic merits
- |2
                      of mankind, but shared the cautious
- |2
                       skepticism of those who rejected the doctrine of prog- ress. In an imaginary dialogue between
- |2
                      Montaigne and Socrates (1683), he represents the former as charging,
- |2
                      in connection with the doctrine of universal degenera- tion, that men do not know how to use the
- |2
                      knowledge they acquire. They are like birds too ignorant to stay away
- |2
                      from a net which has already snared thousands of their kind. Pierre Bayle
- |2
                      pessimistically observed in like vein in his Historical
- |2
                          and Critical Dictionary (1695-97), that “the world is
- |2
                      too undisciplined to profit from the maladies of former
- |2
                      centuries.” “Each century behaves as though it were
- |2
                      the first.”During the seventeenth century Nicolas Boileau-
- |2
                          Despréaux was considered to be the foremost French
- |2
                      theoretician of classicism and defender of the Ancients. In his Critical Reflections on Longinus (1694), he
- |2
                      emphasized what he considered to be one of the strongest arguments in favor
- |2
                      of ancient writers, the constant admiration in which they have
- |2
                      continually been held; a sure and infallible proof, he felt, that they
- |2
                      should always be admired. Yet he also admitted in a letter to Perrault,
- |2
                      published by the latter in 1701, that although no French Cicero or Vergil
- |2
                      had yet appeared, the Age of Louis XIV had surpassed any previous age
- |2
                      in tragedy, painting, architecture, and especially in philosophy and
- |2
                      science. He virtually abandoned the ancients when he admitted,
- |2
                      “the Age of Louis XIV is not only comparable but superior to the
- |2
                      most famous ages of antiquity, even the Age of Augustus.” Had
- |2
                      the debate depended on authority alone, Boileau's ca- pitulation would have meant the total victory of the
- |2
                      moderns at least in France, but other critics continued to exalt the
- |2
                      preeminence of the ancients as still others disparaged them.Abbé Jean Terrasson in a posthumous work, Philoso- phy Applicable to All
- |2
                      Subjects (1754), affirmed that the superiority of the moderns is a
- |2
                      necessary and natural effect of the very constitution of the human
- |2
                      spirit. Fontenelle was wrong, he believed, in resting the argument on
- |2
                      a comparison between trees in various centuries. Since trees in all ages
- |2
                      remain the same, the parallel merely places the moderns on an equal
- |2
                      plane with the ancients. Men, unlike trees, endow their progeny with
- |2
                      their knowledge and advice. The prog- ress of
- |2
                      the human spirit Terrasson illustrated with the old allegory of the human
- |2
                      race as a single man. Instead of accepting such a system, which provides us

- |2
                      shifted to literary theory. Most late seventeenth-century literary critics
- |2
                      limited them- selves to discussing the
- |2
                      Aristotelian rules without mentioning the Stagirite's outmoded science.
- |2
                      Dryden, for example, constantly vacillated between adhering to the
- |2
                      rules and violating them. He admired Shake-
- |2
                      speare, but condemned him by the rules; he praised Milton, but
- |2
                      placed Homer and Vergil higher. In open- ing a
- |2
                      complimentary address to his “Honour'd Friend Dr.
- |2
                      Charleton” (1663), however, he declared,The French had debated the relative merits of the French language and the
- |2
                      classical ones, the moderns unequivocally affirming the superiority of
- |2
                      their own tongue. The English Restoration critics, however, accepted
- |2
                      the theory that English had been a barbarous language until their own
- |2
                      times, and even the most vigorous moderns in England granted the
- |2
                      preference to classical idioms. Addison went so far as to assert in
- |2
                      the Spectator (No. 417) that if “Paradise Lost falls short of the Aeneid or Iliad, it proceeds from the
- |2
                      fault of the language in which it is written.... So divine a poem in
- |2
                      English is like a stately palace built of brick.” Later David
- |2
                      Hume suggested that if “Waller had been born in Rome during the
- |2
                      reign of Tiberius, his first productions had been despised, when compared
- |2
                      to the
- |2
                       finished odes of Horace” (“Of the Rise and
- |2
                      Progress of the Arts and Sciences” [1742]).In England, the formal controversy broke out in full force in 1690 when Sir
- |2
                      William Temple published An Essay upon Ancient and Modern
- |2
                          Learning, asserting the superiority of the ancients in every area
- |2
                      and deny- ing that the moderns profit from their
- |2
                      inheritance. According to his argument, learning which is derived may
- |2
                      weaken invention and dilute genius. “So a Man that only
- |2
                      Translates, shall never be a Poet, nor a Painter that only copies, nor a
- |2
                      Swimmer that swims always with Bladders.” A few pages later he
- |2
                      inconsistently demolished this argument by attributing the revival of
- |2
                      learning in the modern world to the restoration of Greek and pure Latin
- |2
                      after the Middle Ages.Temple adapted the single man metaphor to his purpose by imagining a strong
- |2
                      and vigorous man who should at the age of thirty fall ill and decline
- |2
                      until sixty when he should recover and then be more vigor- ous than most men of this age. Although it could be
- |2
                      said that he had grown more in strength during the ten years from 60 to 70
- |2
                      than at any other period, he had still not acquired more strength and vigor
- |2
                      than he had possessed at the age of thirty. Temple similarly
- |2
                      interpreted the giant-dwarf image to the detriment of the moderns. As
- |2
                      Temple viewed it, the dwarf, despite his advantageous position, sees less
- |2
                      than the giant if he is naturally shorter-sighted, if he is less
- |2
                      observant, or if he is dazzled by height.By speculating on the possibility that our ancients had their own ancients
- |2
                      with a period of intellectual stagnation intervening between them and their
- |2
                          fore- runners, a period comparable to
- |2
                      the Middle Ages, Temple introduced a cyclical theory of history
- |2
                      refuting the idea of progress. According to his reasoning, the arts
- |2
                      and sciences came to the West from India and perhaps ultimately from China.
- |2
                      For information to support this theory—although not the theory
- |2
                      itself— Temple relied upon two major sources, Thomas
- |2
                      Burnet's Telluris theoria sacra (Sacred Theory of the Earth, 1681-89) and John Nieuhoff's Voyages and Travels into Brasil (1682). The cyclical
- |2
                      theory itself was current in the Renaissance and had been refuted by
- |2
                      Bacon.William Wotton answered Temple in Reflections upon Ancient
- |2
                          and Modern Learning (1694), a lengthy treatise, covering all
- |2
                      phases of the arts and sciences, which draws heavily upon Perrault for the
- |2
                      arts and on the defenders of the Royal Society for the sciences. Quite
- |2
                      moderate in his advocacy of the moderns, Wotton refused to follow
- |2
                      Fontenelle in claiming supe- riority for his
- |2
                      own times in oratory and the arts. With impressive logic he observed that
- |2
                      values in the arts are based upon opinion and are subject to debate;Bentley used his linguistic learning to prove that the Greek works of
- |2
                      Phalaris and Aesop, which Temple had extolled as ancients were spurious and
- |2
                      really composi- tions of modern times.
- |2
                      Charles Boyle joined the fray against Bentley, and finally Swift, as a
- |2
                      partisan of Temple and the ancients, produced a masterful satire on
- |2
                      the entire controversy, The Battle of the Books
- |2
                      (1704). Swift's mock epic in prose casts the books in St. James Library
- |2
                      arrayed in two armies, Moderns and Ancients, disputing a plot of ground on
- |2
                      Mount Parnas- sus. The spirit of the work is
- |2
                      succinctly conveyed by one of its mock-epic conventions: the episode of
- |2
                      the spider and the bee. The two insects, representing Mod- erns and Ancients respectively, argue over which of
- |2
                      the two is regarded by the outside world as the superior creature. The
- |2
                      spider affirms that the bee is a plunderer of nature, stealing from every
- |2
                      variety of flower; whereas the spider himself is a domestic animal erect- ing his dwelling entirely through his own
- |2
                      efforts and with materials extracted from his own person. The bee
- |2
                      admits ranging over field and garden, but asserts that his collecting of
- |2
                      nectar does no harm to the flowers he visits; whereas the spider pours out
- |2
                      poison from his breast to spin his web, which perpetually gathers dirt
- |2
                      and sweepings. Aesop, who is chosen to moderate the dispute, decides in
- |2
                      favor of the bee, whom he associates with himself as an Ancient.Whatever we have got, has been by infinite labour and search, and
- |2
                          ranging through every corner of nature; the difference is that, instead
- |2
                          of dirt and poison, we have rather chosen to fill our hives with honey
- |2
                          and wax, thus furnishing mankind with the two noblest of things, which
- |2
                          are sweetness and light.Bacon had preceded Swift in the image of the spider and Ben Jonson in the
- |2
                      image of the bee, and Temple had vastly extended the latter in an essay Of Poetry (1690). Matthew Arnold later adopted the
- |2
                      metaphor “sweetness and light” as the symbol of
- |2
                      classical culture in a famous essay defending it, Culture
- |2
                          and Anarchy (1869).Diderot, a moderate in the controversy, allegorized the quarrel of ancients
- |2
                      and moderns somewhat in the vein of the episode of the spider and the bee
- |2
                      in a digression inserted in a licentious novel written for the
- |2
                      amusement of his mistress, Les Bijoux indiscrets
- |2
                      (1748). One of the characters in a dream finds himself accom- panied by the Goddess Minerva in a
- |2
                      gallery of statues and books symbolizing the ancients. A crowd of men
- |2
                       burn incense and adorn the statues with garlands, at the same
- |2
                      time abusing those of their number who fail to bow profoundly enough before
- |2
                      the statues. These are succeeded by a horde of pygmies, who hack at
- |2
                      the statues and try to tear them apart. Minerva explains that this
- |2
                      quarrel has been going on for a long time, and always to the disadvantage
- |2
                      of the pygmies. The statues run some risk of being tarnished by the
- |2
                      incense of the worshippers, she explains, but the efforts of the
- |2
                      pygmies to destroy them only make them more bril-
- |2
                          liant.Swift, in a companion piece to his Battle of the Books, A
- |2
                          Tale of the Tub (1704), ironically pointed to Homer's gross
- |2
                      ignorance of the laws of England and the doctrines of the Anglican Church
- |2
                      as a means of repudiating the moderns' method of judging Homer by the
- |2
                      standards of a later and more sophisticated age than his. Similarly he
- |2
                      ridiculed the moderns as critics whose art consisted merely in the
- |2
                      discovering and collecting of faults. “Their imaginations are so
- |2
                      entirely possessed and replete with the defects of other
- |2
                      pens,” he charged, “that the very quintessence of
- |2
                      what is bad does of necessity distil into their own.”The method of subjecting Homer to the test of verisimilitude and good taste
- |2
                      was applied in earnest by La Motte and Terrasson. The former condemned
- |2
                      such “low” images as Achilles' asking Thetis to
- |2
                      remove the flies from the wounds of Patroclus; the latter found fault
- |2
                      because the Iliad does not conform to rational
- |2
                      principles of stylistic organization; because the action does not adhere to
- |2
                      the theme of the work; and because Agamemnon commits capital crimes against
- |2
                      religion and justice. The strong implication of both La Motte and
- |2
                      Terrasson was that Homer was as much a barbar-
- |2
                      ian as a poet. The principle argument of La Motte was that Homer
- |2
                      must be subjected to the judgment of reason and not accepted as the voice
- |2
                      of authority. In his opinion, the only pleasures which Homer provides
- |2
                      are those based on novelty, on antiquarianism, on re-
- |2
                          spect for authority, and on prejudice. None of these have any
- |2
                      relation to reason, the single quality on which aesthetic appreciation
- |2
                      should be based (Discours sur
- |2
                      Homère, 1714). La Motte admitted that it was illogical
- |2
                      to attack Homer for not conforming to the dignity of later ages. But he
- |2
                      insisted that criticism had the right to condemn Homeric times for their
- |2
                      barbarousness and to indicate that the description of them in the Iliad appeared disagreeable to the more fastidious
- |2
                      standards of later ages.In 1716, Sir Richard Blackmore published “An Ac- count of the present controversy concerning Homer'sIliad,” in which he also refused to submit to
- |2
                      the au- thority of ancient writers
- |2
                      “unless they were supported by Reason.” He condemned
- |2
                      the ludicrousness of riversPope in An Essay on Criticism (1711), however,
- |2
                      returned to an almost unanswerable defense of the alleged blemishes in
- |2
                      Homer—the argument of the French critics that they were
- |2
                      intentional—designed to provide variety and to present his most
- |2
                      sublime pas- sages in relief.
- |2
                          (I, 179-80)
- |2
                      This is a couplet based on Horace's The Art of Poetry
- |2
                      (lines 359-60), but Pope's defense is stronger than Horace's. The latter
- |2
                      merely suggests that soporific passages may be condoned in a poem which is
- |2
                      very long.The contention in England over the age of the writ-
- |2
                          ings of Aesop and Phalaris, which was waged on lin- guistic grounds, had its counterpart in France in disa- greements over the theory of
- |2
                      translation. Madame Dacier in the Preface to her translation of the Iliad (1711), argued that the more sublime and
- |2
                      beautiful a work is in the original, the more it loses in translation.
- |2
                      No writer suffers as much as Homer does, for it is impossible in French to
- |2
                      communicate the harmony, nobility, and majesty of his expressions.
- |2
                      Characterizing the French language as timid and circumspect because of
- |2
                      its formality and blind adherence to custom, she condemned it for lacking
- |2
                      the boldness and liberty necessary to reveal the beauties of Homer.
- |2
                      Although she was a confirmed classicist, Mme Dacier, in defend- ing Homer, anticipated by a century the
- |2
                      linguistic arguments of the romanticists which were based on freedom
- |2
                      from restraint. Of Lucretius she remarked that his philosophy and
- |2
                      principles were absurd and false, but that the verses in which they were
- |2
                      expressed would charm every ear by their beauty and harmony.Abbé La Motte replied in his Discours sur
- |2
                          Homère (1714) that no one in the modern world could
- |2
                      know the dead languages well enough to appreciate their nuances and
- |2
                      beauties. Those who prided themselves on understanding the beauties and
- |2
                      negligences of Homer, that is, the bold strokes which his admirers
- |2
                      praised him for, could have only an approximate knowledge of ancient Greek.
- |2
                      These critics vaunted themselves for possessing knowledge of a
- |2
                      language which they understood only partially and imperfectly.
- |2
                       La Motte went even further and declared that the French
- |2
                      language was the equal of Greek in beauty of expression. He found examples
- |2
                      to illustrate its clarity in history, sublimity in panegyric, saltiness in
- |2
                      satire, dignity in tragedy, naiveté in fable, and tenderness
- |2
                      in opera. Each language, he maintained, has utilitarian communication
- |2
                      as its function, and harmony and sonority are only secondary. It is only
- |2
                      because French has kept itself within the limits of good sense and
- |2
                      clarity that it can be reproached for lacking boldness. Audacious and
- |2
                      daring terms exist in French speech, but if they should ever become
- |2
                      commonplace, French would become degenerate and corrupt. It is
- |2
                      precisely the good sense of the French language, La Motte insisted,
- |2
                      which represents its greatest richness.Because many French men of letters shared La Motte's pride in the French
- |2
                      language, it was possible for the great French seventeenth-century
- |2
                      authors eventually to displace the ancients as classic models in
- |2
                      French culture. In England, the respect for the vernacular did not reach
- |2
                      these heights, and as a result, English neo-classicism never attained the
- |2
                      authority of the French.Abbé Dubos took an eclectic position in his Critical Reflections on Poetry and Painting (1719), one of
- |2
                      the major documents in the controversy, but on the ques- tion of translation he stood firmly with the
- |2
                      ancients. It is form alone in Homer which gives pleasure, he affirmed,
- |2
                      and therefore Homer must be translated ex-
- |2
                      actly. But Dubos also maintained that no translation can do justice
- |2
                      to the beauty of a poetic original since the rhythm and harmony of
- |2
                      classical verse cannot be rendered in another language. The Aeneid in French is not the same poem as the Aeneid in Latin. Dubos argued, moreover, that those
- |2
                      who cannot read an an- cient poem in the
- |2
                      original must accept the judgment about it of those who can. One cannot
- |2
                      rely on one's own appraisal of a translation no matter how rational
- |2
                      the appraisal may be, since the translation and the original are different
- |2
                      entities. The beauties of a poem are judged by sentiment, not reason, and
- |2
                      “the general agreement of the senses of other men, is next to
- |2
                      the agreement of our own, the most certain means we have of judging
- |2
                      phenomena which are ranked under senti-
- |2
                      ment.”With these arguments Dubos was opposing those moderns like La Motte, who
- |2
                      considered that the chief value of studying the ancients was to obtain
- |2
                      historical and sociological information and that the purpose of
- |2
                      criticism was to place an author in his philosophical and historical
- |2
                      context. In rejecting sociological criti-
- |2
                      cism, Dubos discounted the need for verisimilitude and historical
- |2
                      accuracy in art. We do not read poetry to look for contradictions, he
- |2
                      affirmed, but for the pleas-The sociological criticism which Dubos opposed could be used, however, to
- |2
                      the advantage of the An- cients.
- |2
                      Fénelon in a Letter on the Activities of the
- |2
                          Academy (1716), suggested that the deformity and crudeness of
- |2
                      religion and the lack of true morality in Homeric times served to make
- |2
                      Homer's artistic achievement all the more admirable by contrast. The
- |2
                      great epic poet had portrayed with superb imagery and verbal power concepts
- |2
                      which in themselves are absurd and shocking. Jean Bovin in his Apology for Homer (1715), made a comparison with
- |2
                      China, which was emerging at that time as a popular theme. What he
- |2
                      enjoyed in reading about China, he said, was Chinese customs.
- |2
                      “If the heroes of the century of Homer do not resemble ours,
- |2
                      this difference should give us pleasure.”Although Giambattista Vico in Italy wrote his New
- |2
                      Science (Scienza Nuova [1725; 1744]), with
- |2
                      absolutely no reference to the critical dispute raging in France and
- |2
                      England, the fundamental thought of his treatise completely contradicts
- |2
                      those who attributed philo- sophical
- |2
                      discrimination to the ancients. Vico believed that it was fear which first
- |2
                      led men to create gods in their imaginations and that their first form of
- |2
                      expression was poetical. Contrary to all the ancient philosophers,
- |2
                      including Plato and Aristotle, Vico believed that “it was the
- |2
                      deficiency of human reasoning power that gave rise to poetry,”
- |2
                      and he concluded that his discovery of “the origins of poetry
- |2
                      does away with the opinion of the matchless wisdom of the
- |2
                      ancients.”Addison in the Spectator (No. 160 [1711]), used Homer
- |2
                      as his only example of natural genius in a distinction between the
- |2
                      contributions to humanity which depend upon native inspiration alone and
- |2
                      those which have depended upon accumulated experience. Those in the
- |2
                      first category of genius have “... by the mere Strength of
- |2
                      natural Parts, and without any Assist- ance
- |2
                      of Art of Learning,... produced Works that were the Delight of their own
- |2
                      Times and the Wonder of
- |2
                       Posterity.” The second category, “formed
- |2
                      themselves by Rules, and submitted the Greatness of their natural
- |2
                      Talents to the Corrections and Restraints of Art.” Homer was
- |2
                      Addison's single example of the first class, and Plato, Aristotle, Vergil,
- |2
                      Cicero, Milton, and Bacon of the second. Abbé Dubos converted this
- |2
                      distinction to one between ancients and moderns. He affirmed that the
- |2
                      moderns are undoubtedly more advanced in the sciences, but their
- |2
                      superiority depends on the prior accumulation of a mass of knowledge, not
- |2
                      on genius. Modern reason, therefore, is not really superior to
- |2
                      ancient. In the realm of art, moreover, time and expe- rience are of no value. The high esteem in which
- |2
                      Homer is held, Dubos maintained, is not due to the reign of Aristotle and
- |2
                      should not be reduced because the latter has fallen from favor; instead
- |2
                      Homer's repu- tation is based entirely on the
- |2
                      pleasure which people of all ages have found in his work.Pope in An Essay on Criticism attempted to blur the
- |2
                      distinction between genius and acquired experience by affirming that to
- |2
                      follow nature and to imitate the ancients is the same thing.Diderot, however, in a highly-regarded critical essay,Salon de 1767, affirmed that precisely because
- |2
                      the Greeks had based their artistic creation on nature, their work
- |2
                      could never be excelled. “The inviolable laws of Nature must be
- |2
                      executed; Nature does nothing by leaps and bounds, and this is no less true
- |2
                      in the arts than in the cosmos.” Despite the possibility of goingMarivaux in The Mirror (1755) offered an explanation
- |2
                      of the paradox that literary works could be greater in ancient times than
- |2
                      in modern despite the accumulation and proliferation of knowledge in the
- |2
                      modern world. He maintained that ideas and taste are not parallel and,
- |2
                      therefore, do not increase at the same rate. Each gen- eration which comes on the earth adds its own portion
- |2
                      to the stock of ideas, and these never entirely disap- pear: their impression remains indelibly in
- |2
                      humanity. But even though modern times may have a greater accumulation
- |2
                      of ideas than existed in the past, there is unfortunately less of taste.
- |2
                      The augmentation of ideas is an infallible consequence of the duration of
- |2
                      the world, Marivaux concluded, but the art of employing those ideas in
- |2
                      works of the spirit may decline—in which event belles lettres
- |2
                      may sink, criticism and taste disappear. Marivaux concluded, therefore,
- |2
                      that there had never been a period to equal that of the ancients.Vauvenargues in his Discourse on the Character of Various
- |2
                          Centuries (1745) made a parallel admission that ineffably greater
- |2
                      knowledge is available in modern times than in the past, but he questioned
- |2
                      whether the average man was capable of assimilating or utilizing this
- |2
                      knowledge. As far as Vauvenargues was concerned, that which depends on the
- |2
                      spirit receives no increase from the proliferation of the products of the
- |2
                      intellect, and since taste depends on the spirit, knowledge is being
- |2
                      increased in vain: “our judgment is instructed, but our taste is
- |2
                      not improved.”Even Turgot, one of the most ardent exponents of perfectibility, conceded
- |2
                      that while the capacity for knowledge of the nature of truth is as infinite
- |2
                      as truth itself, the development of the arts is as limited as man
- |2
                      himself. Poetry, painting, and music have a fixed point determined by
- |2
                      language and by the sensibility of our organs. This fixed point, Turgot
- |2
                      believed, had been attained by the men of the Age of Augustus, who,
- |2
                      therefore, will remain as models for all subsequent generations (Second Discourse... on the Progress of the Human
- |2
                      Mind, 1750).Abbé Terrasson refused to accept the separation of arts and
- |2
                      sciences as valid in the measurement of human progress, condemning the
- |2
                      division as artificial by means of an original variant of the single-man
- |2
                      image. In a discourse with the pertinent title, Philosophy Applica- ble to all the
- |2
                          objects of the Mind and Reason (1754), he affirmed that such a
- |2
                      separation would perhaps be
- |2
                       applicable to a creature with two souls, but it does not fit
- |2
                      humanity. He maintained, moreover, that infe-
- |2
                      rior as the ancients were in the sciences, they knew more about
- |2
                      them, particularly geometry and astron- omy,
- |2
                      than they knew about the true principles of reason and humanity,
- |2
                      “unique source of the true use of belles-lettres in prose and
- |2
                      poetry.”The first critic to suggest the possibility that the fine arts may progress,
- |2
                      just as the sciences do, was Edward Young. As part of his campaign against
- |2
                      the principle of imitation in literature, he urged poets not only to
- |2
                      go beyond the ancients in representing nature, but even to go beyond nature
- |2
                      itself and to develop a world of pure imagination. “In the
- |2
                      fairyland of fancy,” he remarked in his Conjectures, “genius may wander wild; there it has
- |2
                      creative power, and may reign arbitrarily over its own empire of
- |2
                      chimeras.” This is the essence of the ultra-modern spirit, and
- |2
                      Young himself recog- nized that it was partly
- |2
                      rant. But he declared unequiv- ocally,
- |2
                      “all arts and sciences are making considerable
- |2
                      advance,” and he did not hesitate to ask, “why may
- |2
                      not poetry go forward with this advancement?”Condorcet, probably the most ardent “perfectibilian”
- |2
                      of the century, vigorously supported the view that progress occurs in the
- |2
                      fine arts. In his Historical Sketch (1793) he made
- |2
                      an original distinction between “that which belongs really to
- |2
                      the progress of art and that which is due only to the talent of the
- |2
                      artist.” In the past, he contended, critics had judged artists
- |2
                      rather than works, giving rise to the adulation of the ancient authors
- |2
                      and the growth of a cult requiring imitation of the first models. Although
- |2
                      not making any aesthetic comparisons between specific ancient and modern
- |2
                          au- thors, Condorcet affirmed that the arts
- |2
                      are improved by and draw profit from advances in philosophy and
- |2
                      science—either through more precise knowledge of the effects and
- |2
                      powers of these arts themselves or through the destruction of prejudices
- |2
                      against them. Reasoning such as this may have inspired the poet Shelley
- |2
                      to speculate in the Preface to The Revolt of Islam
- |2
                      (1817), that “there may be such a thing as perfectibility
- |2
                      in works of fiction.”This doctrine of perfectibility is related to the socio- logical criticism of La Motte since both systems
- |2
                      assume that literature is as much a product of society as of
- |2
                      individuals. The concept of the interaction of literature and society
- |2
                      directly opposes all theories of absolute values, including that of the
- |2
                      supremacy of the ancients. Mme de Staël fully developoed the
- |2
                      concept in her pioneer treatise Literature Considered in
- |2
                          Its Relations with Social Institutions (De la
- |2
                          Littérature considerée dans ses rapports avec les
- |2
                          institutions sociales, 1800).In Spain, ever since Luis Vives in the sixteenth century had used literary
- |2
                      arguments against the doc-In France the debate continued on scientific as well as aesthetic grounds.
- |2
                      Father Noël Regnault, in hisAncient Origin of New Physics (L'Origine ancienne de la physique nouvelle [1734]), stressed
- |2
                      the great debt which modern science owes to the ancients and argued
- |2
                      that the improvements of his day would not have been possible without the
- |2
                      ancients. A French Protestant clergyman, living in England, Louis Dutens,
- |2
                      published in 1766 An Inquiry into the Origin of the
- |2
                          Discoveries attributed to the Moderns: Wherein It is Demonstrated,
- |2
                          That our most celebrated Philosophers have, for most part, taken what
- |2
                          they advance from the Works of the Ancients, and that many important
- |2
                          Truths in Religion were known to the Pagan Sages. Considering the
- |2
                      works of his predecessors, Perrault, Fontenelle, Wotton, and Temple as
- |2
                      comprising fine declamation and rhetoric rather than proofs or
- |2
                      demonstrations, Dutens at- tempted to reveal
- |2
                      the enormous share the ancients have had in “modern
- |2
                      discoveries.” He followed Addison and Dubos in distinguishing
- |2
                      between those arts and sciences “which require long experience
- |2
                      and practice to bring them to perfection, and those which depend solely
- |2
                      on talent and genius.” He admitted that the moderns have
- |2
                       brought the former to higher stages of development, and that
- |2
                      the Christian religion has even extended mo-
- |2
                      rality itself. Also in the area of scientific inventions, he
- |2
                      distinguished between the products of genius and philosophy and the
- |2
                      “mere effects of chance, or the lucky hits of some ignorant
- |2
                      artisans.” After including printing, gunpowder, and the compass
- |2
                      in the category of lucky hits he tried to trace to the ancients the
- |2
                      systems of logic and metaphysics of Descartes, Leibniz, Malebranche, and
- |2
                      Locke; Buffon's theories of universal matter, generation, and nutrition:
- |2
                      Newton's theory of colors; Harvey's theory of the circulation of blood;
- |2
                      the plurality of worlds; the motion of the earth around the sun; and
- |2
                      the sexual system of plants. On the subjects of architecture, sculpture,
- |2
                      poetry, eloquence, and his- tory, Dutens took
- |2
                      for granted the preeminence of the ancients, affirming that “The
- |2
                      moderns themselves will not contest with them; on the contrary the height
- |2
                      of their ambition is, to imitate them.” Dutens concluded
- |2
                      that the ancients had preceded or prepared the way for the moderns
- |2
                      “in almost all truths of the greatest importance.”
- |2
                      Supporting the theory of Temple that the ancients had their own ancients,
- |2
                      as well as commenting on the opinion of Perrault that recent discoveries
- |2
                      had been so extensive that there was little left to be learned, he
- |2
                      quoted Seneca concerning the future: “Had even everything been
- |2
                      found out by the ancients, there would still this remain to be done anew,
- |2
                      to put their inven- tions into use and make their knowledge ours” (Epistle 64). Though Dutens' work is today virtually
- |2
                      unknown, it was widely circulated in its own time. John Wesley, for
- |2
                      example, republished it in abridged form in later editions of his Survey of the Wisdom of God in Crea-
- |2
                              tion—a text-book of popular science originally
- |2
                          pub- lished in 1763—which went
- |2
                      through several editions in England and the United States. Summarizing his
- |2
                      own impression, Wesley exclaimed: “Alas! how little new has
- |2
                      been discovered, even by Gassendi, Malebranche, Mr. Locke, or Sir Isaac
- |2
                      Newton! How plain is it, that in philosophy, as well as the course of human
- |2
                      affairs, 'there is nothing new under the sun.'”A number of replies to this objection of the lack of novelty, which Wesley
- |2
                      was quoting from Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament
- |2
                      (1:9), were already in print. In order to discourage literary imitations,
- |2
                      La Motte ridi- culed the concept that no new
- |2
                      thoughts are possible and that the human mind had already imagined every- thing that could be said. He compared
- |2
                      ideas to the variety in human physiognomies and affirmed that
- |2
                      experience shows that no two men will ever be born who are exactly alike.
- |2
                      In like manner, even though ideas may always follow certain common paths,
- |2
                      there will always be infinite opportunity for original appli- cations (Discourse
- |2
                          on Poetry [1707]). Marivaux in The086
- |2
                           Mirror (1755) made exactly the same comparison and
- |2
                      added as a further analogy that just as man has not discovered all the
- |2
                      forms of which matter is susceptible, he has not exhausted all the ways of
- |2
                      thinking and feeling.Dubos similarly argued that artists of genius do not use the works of their
- |2
                      predecessors as models, but go directly to nature. “Nature is
- |2
                      more abundant in differ- ent or varied
- |2
                      subjects than the genius of artisans in ways of imitating them.”
- |2
                      Dubos made the original observation, moreover, that particular subjects
- |2
                      are compatible for the talents of particular artists, and that some
- |2
                      subjects remain virtually untouched because no artist has yet discovered
- |2
                      them. Thomas Paine charac-
- |2
                      teristically scoffed in an essay in The
- |2
                          Pennsylvania Magazine (1775) that the notion that “We have found out everything has been the motto of
- |2
                      every age,” and that this species of vanity was stronger among
- |2
                      the ancients than the moderns. Combining chronological and cultural
- |2
                      primitivism, he diverted himself by look- ing
- |2
                      back and imagining “a circle of original Indians haranguing on
- |2
                      the sublime perfection of the age.”Voltaire associated the quarrel of ancients and mod-
- |2
                          erns with one of the most important scientific projects of the
- |2
                      century, twin expeditions organized by the French Academy of Science to
- |2
                      measure the latitude at the North Pole and at the Equator and thus to
- |2
                      test Newton's hypothesis that the earth is flattened at the poles. In
- |2
                      a congratulatory poem to the scientists (“A Messieurs de
- |2
                      l'Académie des Sciences” [1738]), Voltaire
- |2
                      unequivocally espoused the side of the moderns. Addressing the ancient
- |2
                      Greeks, Voltaire bid them to be ashamed and embarrassed at their poor
- |2
                      performance in contrast to the great exploits of his contemporaries.
- |2
                      “Your century” he declared “is vanquished by
- |2
                      the century in which we are.” According to Voltaire, opin- ion in the past had universally favored the
- |2
                      Greeks, only because it had been in bondage to lies and prejudices. In
- |2
                      a note to his poem, Voltaire reaffirmed the parallel between science and
- |2
                      literature, but his examples reveal his own prejudices. He declared that
- |2
                      two minor French musical tragedies, Alcine and Armide, were worth more than all Greek poetry put
- |2
                      together and that Thales and Pythagoras were not fit to study under
- |2
                      Newton. “But the first-comers seized the Temple of Glory,
- |2
                      time confirmed their claim, and the late-comers find the area
- |2
                      occupied.” In one of his tales, “The World as It
- |2
                      is” (1746) Voltaire insisted that the first efforts in
- |2
                      every art are always crude despite the preference which critics
- |2
                      stubbornly accord to the ancients over the mod-
- |2
                      erns. In his seminal history The Century of Louis
- |2
                      XIV (1752), he unequivocally asserted “the prodigious su- periority of our century over the
- |2
                      ancients” and added that at least as far as philosophy is
- |2
                      concerned the
- |2
                       dispute is definitely decided in favor of the moderns. In a
- |2
                      later dialogue bearing the title Ancients and
- |2
                      Moderns (1765), Voltaire retreated to the more moder- ate position of Fontenelle that the controversy
- |2
                      could best be resolved by granting that the modern world had
- |2
                      discovered new laws of physics, but had not improved upon the ancients'
- |2
                      rules of eloquence.Oliver Goldsmith maintained that there exists no real basis of comparison
- |2
                      between ancients and moderns, calling in question, in his An Enquiry into the Present State of Polite Learning (1759), the
- |2
                      commonplace that nature is always the same. According to Goldsmith,
- |2
                      both ancients and moderns imitated nature as they found it, but nature was
- |2
                      different for each culture. Both ancients and moderns should then be
- |2
                      considered excel- lent in their separate
- |2
                      imitations. Homer would have been despised by the Greeks if he had written
- |2
                      like Milton, and Milton would have been ridiculous if he had adopted
- |2
                      Homer's religion. One should not con- demn
- |2
                      Plautus for failing to depict characters like Molière's, nor the
- |2
                      reverse. To do so would be as absurd as condemning “a geographer
- |2
                      for not introducing more rivers, or promontories, into a country, than
- |2
                      nature had given it; or the natural historian, for not enlivening his
- |2
                      description of a dead landscape with a torrent, cataract, or a
- |2
                      volcano.”For Herder in Germany, it was not precisely nature which changes from one
- |2
                      chronological period to an- other, but national
- |2
                      cultures which differ one from another. Classical art he described, in an
- |2
                      essay Homer und Ossian (1795), as an
- |2
                      expression of national, cultural and social conditions which no longer
- |2
                      exist in the modern world. Imitations of ancient art, therefore, are
- |2
                      false and without soul since they do not express the emotions of the
- |2
                      artist. According to Herder, a German poet of the eighteenth century cannot
- |2
                      create ancient art just as an apple tree cannot bear pears.Herder argued moreover in his Philosophy of the History of
- |2
                          the Development of Mankind (Philosophie der
- |2
                          Geschichte zur Bildung der Menschheit [1774]) that just as
- |2
                      there exists no “absolute” human being, but all
- |2
                      members of the human race differ one from another, there can be no one
- |2
                      historical form of culture—the ancient or any
- |2
                      other—which can be made as an “abso- lute ideal.” The classic norm forced the poet
- |2
                      to be an imitator, not a creator. Herder, like Goldsmith, was a
- |2
                      moderate. He did not try to elevate either the ancient or the modern world
- |2
                      over the other, but he agreed with virtually all of his predecessors on the
- |2
                      side of the moderns that the artist should follow his own inspira- tion or native talent rather than the
- |2
                      standards or models of the past.New impetus for studying and understanding the ancients came during the
- |2
                      second half of the eighteenthThe best general treatment is that of J. B. Bury in The Idea of Progress (London 1920; New York, 1932). The
- |2
                          Renaissance background is exhaustively presented by José
- |2
                          Antonio Maravall in Antiguos y Modernos. La idea

                          (Madrid, 1966). The French aspect is treated by H. Rigault in Histoire de la querelle des modernes (Paris,
- |2
                          1856), which is supple- mented by A.

                          Lombard, La Querelle des anciens et des modernes.

                              l'abbé Dubos (Neuchâtel, 1908). The

                              La Henriade is especially valuable for

  \               ANCIENTS AND MODERNS INTHE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\n                The
  idea of progress, finding expression in many\n                    forms and levels,
  was most vociferously discussed during the\n                    eighteenth century
  in the literary quarrel of the an-\n                        cients and moderns,
  which embraced questions of au- thority, antiquarianism, and the new experimental
  sci- ence. The attack on authority in science and\n                    literary
  criticism first foreshadowed and later paralleled the\n                    challenging
  of authority in religion and politics, which developed during\n                    the
  Enlightenment in systems of deism and political democracy.\n                Most
  of the arguments in favor of modern learning as opposed to ancient grew\n                    out
  of the efforts of Descartes and Bacon to persuade their respective\n                    countrymen
  to adopt a new method of judging and seeking truth. Both\n                    rejected
  the authority of the an- cients in\n                    scientific questions—Bacon
  as part of his inductive method and\n                    Descartes as part of his
  system of “methodical\n                    doubt.” Descartes asserted in the first
  article, The Passions of the Mind (1649):\n                \n                    What
  the ancients have taught is so scanty and for the most part so\n                        lacking
  in credibility that I may not hope for any kind of approach\n                        toward
  truth except by rejecting all the paths which they have\n                        followed.\n
  \               \n                Aristotle, was first attacked and discredited
  in the realm of science, and\n                    then disputed in literature. Homer
  developed as another natural target.\n                    Critics assumed that if
  they could sufficiently tarnish his image,\n                    they would succeed
  in proving the superiority of the modern age.\n                Abbé Pons in France,
  for example, praised Descartes for subjecting\n                    the scientific
  system of Aristotle to rigid scrutiny and exposing the\n                    latter's
  deviations from truth. Then he pointed to the parallel between the\n                    long
  reign of Aristotle in science and that of Homer in literature. He\n                    argued
  in his Letter on the “Iliad” of La Motte (Lettre sur “l'Iliade” de la Motte,\n                    1714)
  that the rejec- tion of Aristotle\n                    furnished a presentiment
  of the immi- nent fall\n                    of Homer. Two years later, the English
  poet077\n                     Sir Richard Blackmore drew the same parallel between
  science\n                    and criticism in his Essay upon Epick Poetry:\n                    “Unless
  the Admirers of Homer will assert and\n                    prove their Infallibility,”
  he challenged, “why may\n                    they not be deceiv'd as well as the
  Disciples and Adorers ofAristotle?”\n                Even after Aristotle had been
  dethroned in the realm of science, it remained\n                    difficult to
  budge Homer from his pedestal. Critical opinion in the late\n                    seventeenth
  century generally agreed with Boileau that since Homer had\n                    been
  constantly admired and followed throughout the ages, he should always\n                    continue
  to be admired and imitated. The abbé Terrasson,\n                    however, in
  his Critical Dissertation on the\n                        “Iliad” (Dissertation\n
  \                       critique sur “l'Iliade,” 1715) revolted against\n                    this
  logic. For him, literary work should not be judged according to\n                    the
  reputation it had enjoyed in the past, but ac-\n                        cording
  to its conformity to reason and nature. Literary\n                    criticism,
  according to Terrasson, should adopt the philosophic spirit\n                    which
  had been responsible for progress in the natural sciences,\n                    acknowledging
  the superiority of “reason which leads us to\n                    attribute each
  phenomenon to its proper and natural principle,”\n                        in- dependent
  of the opinion of other\n                    men. Blackmore said essentially the
  same:\n                \n                    It's clear, that Aristotle form'd all
  his Axioms and\n                        Doctrines in Poetry, from the Patterns of
  Homer and other Greek\n                        Writers; and without assigning any
  Reason of his Positions. ... But it\n                        is not the Authority
  of the greatest Masters, but solid and convincing\n                        Evidence,
  that must engage our Belief.\n                \n                The debate concerned
  not only the two separate issues of which age possessed\n                    greater
  genius or mental powers and which possessed greater knowledge,\n                    but
  also a far more important one; did an increase of knowledge mean\n                    progress?
  This is another way of asking whether people are actually happier\n                    in
  the modern world. The partisans of the ancients were obviously\n                    accepting
  a form of cultural primitivism. Some men who did not profess any\n                    form
  of primitivism, nevertheless considered the new science as\n                    nothing
  more than an interesting development, which did nothing to\n                    change
  man's nature or to make him any happier. Others justified their\n                    indifference
  to the ques- tion by appealing to\n                    the commonplace observation
  of the century—that human nature\n                    never changes. Lord Chesterfield,
  for example, prided himself on the dis- covery “that nature was the same\n                    three
  thousand years ago as it is at present; that men were but men\n                    then
  as well as now.” He was willing to grant that modes and\n                    customs
  often vary, but insisted that “human nature is always\n                    the same.”
  Taking a common- place\n                    metaphor, originally introduced by Montaigne,
  he argued in a letter to his\n                    son, 7 February 1749, that there
  is no more reason to assume that men were\n                     better, braver,
  or wiser in ancient times than “to sup- pose that the animals or vegetables were\n
  \                   better then than they are now.” La Bruyère in another\n                    famous
  analogy, from his Caractères (1687),\n                    compared authors who espoused
  the side of the moderns to robust\n                    infants who suck the nourishing
  milk of their nurses and then revolt\n                    and beat them.\n                The
  major disputants in the quarrel between ancients and moderns made use of\n                    three
  primary metaphorical expressions which passed from pen to pen\n                    without
  acknowledgment: (1) the paradox that modern men are the real\n                    ancients;
  (2) the image of the human race as a single man; and (3) the\n                    image
  of a giant with a dwarf on his shoulders.\n                (1) The paradox concerning
  the antiquity of modern men derives from Bacon,\n                    who expressed
  it in Latin,Antiquitas saeculi juventus mundi\n                    (“Ancient times
  are the youth of the world”). Our\n                    times then are the an- cient
  times\n                    “when the world is ancient and not those which we account\n
  \                       ordine retrogrado by a computation\n                    backward
  from ourselves.” The same paradox may be found in\n                    Descartes,
  Pascal, and Malebranche. TheEncyclopédie, in the article,\n                        “Anciens,”
  called it\n                    an ingenious sophism, equivalent to the pleasantry,
  le monde est si vieux qu'il radote (“the world is\n                    so old it
  drivels”). In the last decade of the eighteenth\n                    century, Thomas
  Paine gave the argument a political twist inThe Rights of Man (1791) in order to
  discredit\n                    Burke's concept of prescription. The only reason
  for studying\n                    governments in the ancient world, as far as Paine
  was concerned, was to\n                    profit by their errors and to perceive
  later improvements by contrast.\n                    “Those who lived a hundred
  or a thousand years ago,”\n                    Paine affirmed, “were then moderns
  as we are now.”\n                (2) The image of the human race as a single man
  compared the life span of\n                    the entire human race to one man's
  progress from cradle to grave. It exists\n                    in both Roger Bacon
  and Francis Bacon and in all the major\n                    participants in the
  ancient-moderns dispute. The figure could be used by\n                    one side
  to show that the race was already approaching senility, and by the\n                    other
  side to characterize the ancients as infants.\n                (3) The giant-dwarf
  image represents the ancients as giants supporting the\n                    moderns
  as dwarfs on their shoulders so that the latter may have an\n                    advantageous
  view of nature. The metaphor figured prominently during\n                    the
  Renaissance in the writing of the Spaniard, Juan Luis Vives\n                    (1492-1540),
  and in Ben Jonson (1572-1637), and was reintroduced by\n                    Fontenelle.
  This image may also be used to support either side of the\n                    controversy:
  the ancients interpreted the puny figure of the modern dwarf\n                    as
  a sign of decay, but the mod- erns considered\n                    his advantageous
  position as a symbol of the superior knowledge of modern\n                    times.\n
  \               078\n                \n                The debate was introduced
  into the literary realm by Alessandro Tassoni in\n                    the last of
  his Ten Books of Miscellaneous Thoughts\n                        (Dieci libri di
  pensieri diversi [1620]).\n                    In theory he seemed to favor the
  ancients by attacking the argument that\n                    knowledge is cumulative
  and that, therefore, it must always be the latest\n                        gener-
  ation which has the greatest\n                    amount of it. Such reason- ing,
  he affirmed,\n                    would hold only if study and research were continuously
  carried on by\n                    outstanding minds, but in actuality learning
  has frequently been\n                    captured by hostile forces or inferior
  intellects and thus learning\n                    may decline instead of advance.
  In his pragmatic sur-\n                        vey of the concrete achievements
  of civilization, how- ever, Tassoni acknowledged the superiority of the\n                    moderns.
  It follows from Tassoni's arguments that progress does not need to\n                    take
  place in a straight line, but it may occur in spurts and jumps; some\n                    areas
  may go forward while others go backwards, and there may even be\n                    occasional
  periods of total retrogression.\n                In France, the preliminary skirmishes
  began in 1635, when a minor poet,\n                    Boisrobert, who had probably
  read Tassoni in translation, attacked the\n                    ancients before the
  French Academy. He was followed by Desmarets de\n                    Saint-Sorlin
  who argued passionately in his Discourse to\n                        Prove That
  Only Christian Subjects are Appropriate to Heroic\n                    Poetry (Discours
  pour prouver que les sujets\n                        chrétiens sont seuls propres
  à la poésie\n                        héroïque [1673]), that Christian miracles\n
  \                   are far superior to pagan my- thology as\n                    subjects
  for heroic poetry. Although the dispute over the use of Christian\n                    subject
  matter in the epic tradition developed in England as a\n                    separate
  contest, completely independent of that between the ancients\n                    and
  moderns, the two contests are themati-\n                    cally related. The advocates
  of Christian poetry took up their\n                    position with the moderns,
  for the substitution of Christian materials for\n                    the classical
  deities represents a triumph of the contemporary world over\n                    the
  past. Desmarets maintained that the epic poet must be not only a\n                    story-teller,
  but also an authority on “history, geography,\n                    astronomy, matters
  of nature, logic, ethics, rhetoric, fables, agriculture,\n                    architecture,
  painting, sculpture, perspective, and music.” This\n                    requirement
  of extensive knowledge for the epic poet obviously put the\n                    ancients
  at a great disadvantage. John Dryden similarly required the epic\n                    poet
  to combine the “natu- ral\n                    endowments, of a large invention,
  a ripe judgment, and a strong\n                    memory” with “the knowledge of
  liberal arts and\n                    sciences, and particularly moral philosophy,
  the mathematics, geography,\n                    and history.”\n                Carrying
  the controversy to the completely different area of linguistics,\n                    François
  Charpentier in 1683 pub-\n                    lished a treatise, On the Excellence
  of the French\n                            Lan- guage (De\n                        l'Excellence
  de la langue française), arguing that\n                    modern French rather
  than the classical languages\n                     should be the medium for inscriptions
  on public monu- ments. Taking a position which Alexander\n                    Pope
  was to express a generation later in his satires, (First Epistle of the Second Book
  of Horace [1737]), and\n                    Marivaux in his Miroir (XI [1755]),
  Charpentier\n                    maintained that those who expressed a preference
  for the ancients did\n                    so because they were jealous of contemporary
  authors.\n                In 1687 Charles Perrault united literary and scien-\n
  \                       tific considerations in a poem exalting his own times,The
  Century of Louis XIV (Le\n                        Siècle de Louis le Grand) which
  he read before the\n                    Academy. The an- cients were great in their\n
  \                   way, he admitted, but still had all the limitations of human
  beings. Homer\n                    had written under the disadvantages of living
  in a primitive society\n                    and, therefore, had fallen into various
  errors which he could have avoided\n                    had he written in the modern
  world. Without qualification Perrault\n                    affirmed that the ancient
  authorities in science and history,\n                    Aristotle and Herodotus,
  had already been discredited. As symbols of the\n                    scientific
  superiority of the moderns, Perrault featured in his poem a\n                    detailed
  description of the telescope and microscope. We may find\n                    close
  parallels to these passages in many French and English poems as\n                    well
  as in a Russian Georgic poem, Letter on the Use of\n                        Glass
  (1752) by M. V. Lomonosov.\n                Perrault further developed his notions
  in a prose dialogue, Parallels between Ancients and Moderns (1688-96),\n                    not
  actually intended to show parallels, but instead differences and\n                    distinctions.
  For the gathering of ammunition against the ancients, he\n                    appealed
  to the astronomer Huygens, who supplied him with informa- tion concerning the advance
  of\n                    science. On the literary side Perrault repeated his charge
  that Homer\n                    and Vergil had been guilty of an infinite number
  of errors because\n                    they lacked knowledge which came to light
  in later times. As one example of\n                    Homer's great defi- ciencies,
  his lack of\n                    verisimilitude, Perrault pointed to the victory
  of Ulysses and three of his\n                    friends over 108 suitors of Penelope:
  the four warriors surmounting\n                    impossible odds to kill their
  foes without taking them by surprise, while\n                    Ulysses in the
  midst of the fray delivered a long moral discourse.\n                Mme Dacier
  answered the objections to the errors and implausibilities of the\n                    ancients
  by affirming that whatever reproaches are made against Homer may\n                    be
  made equally against the Old Testament. In the preface to her\n                    translation
  of the Iliad (1711) she confined the\n                    argument to social customs
  rather than to scientific knowledge. The epic\n                    poet must portray
  customs and behavior exactly as they are in his own\n                    times;
  otherwise his imitation of nature will be false and his heroes\n                    no
  more credible than heroes of romances. “In a word, the\n                    poem
  imitates what exists and not that which has come into being only after\n                    it.”
  Since Homer could not079\n                     conform to the usages of later centuries,
  it is necessary for\n                    later centuries to comprehend the customs
  of his century.\n                In 1688 Fontenelle published a volume of pastoral
  poetry in which he\n                    inserted a Digression sur les anciens et
  les\n                    modernes. Here he maintained that the question of the preeminence\n
  \                   of ancients or moderns may be reduced to a consideration of
  whether the\n                    trees of former times were taller than those growing
  at present, a\n                    problem which had been presented by Montaigne
  in the Apologie de Raymond Sebond. This is a phase of the related\n                    theological
  doctrine of the degeneration of the world. Fontenelle argued\n                    that
  if biological differences exist in man as well as in plants,\n                    these
  differences are caused by geography and climate, not by\n                    chronology.
  And since the climate is essentially the same in Greece, Italy,\n                    and
  France, all human beings, including the ancients and moderns, Greeks,\n                    Romans,
  and French, are biologically equal. A scientist of mod- ern times, he affirmed,
  because of the\n                    accumulation of information knows ten times
  more than one of the times\n                    of Augustus, and he has ten times
  greater facility in acquiring his\n                    knowledge. The great reputation
  of the ancients is based upon prejudice and\n                    tradition. In literature,
  the names of the ancients sound better to\n                    our ears merely because
  they are Greek and Latin. Before Fontenelle,\n                    eloquence and
  poetry had been the main subjects of contention, but for him\n                    they
  counted less than the sciences. He admitted that the ancients\n                    could
  theoretically have attained perfection in elo-\n                        quence and
  poetry, but granted that they had actually attained\n                    it only
  in the former. Critics were accustomed to consider both Greeks and\n                    Romans
  as ancients, but Fontenelle affirmed that in a relative sense the\n                    Romans
  were moderns. In literary merit, he placed Cicero over\n                    Demosthenes,
  Vergil over both Theocritus and Homer, Horace over Pindar, and\n                    Livy
  over the Greek histori- ans. And he\n                    asserted for his contemporaries
  a further claim to\n                    superiority—that they had developed new
  literary forms like the\n                    novel, and the lettres galantes which
  had not\n                    existed in antiquity.\n                Fontenelle also
  touched on the faults of Homer, which the latter's admirers\n                    had
  attempted to exonerate or vindicate under the plea of poetic license.\n                    Homer,
  for example, indiscriminately mingled as many as five dialects\n                    in
  a single line, a process equivalent to a French poet's blending the\n                    dialects
  of Picardy, Gas- cony, Normandy, and\n                    Brittany with ordinary
  French. Both Perrault and Fontenelle used the single\n                    man image,
  but the latter refused to carry the comparison to its\n                    logical
  end, resolutely affirming that the human race would never\n                    degenerate
  into senility.\n                Fontenelle, nevertheless, had no illusions concerning
  the intrinsic merits\n                    of mankind, but shared the cautious\n
  \                    skepticism of those who rejected the doctrine of prog- ress.
  In an imaginary dialogue between\n                    Montaigne and Socrates (1683),
  he represents the former as charging,\n                    in connection with the
  doctrine of universal degenera- tion, that men do not know how to use the\n                    knowledge
  they acquire. They are like birds too ignorant to stay away\n                    from
  a net which has already snared thousands of their kind. Pierre Bayle\n                    pessimistically
  observed in like vein in his Historical\n                        and Critical Dictionary
  (1695-97), that “the world is\n                    too undisciplined to profit from
  the maladies of former\n                    centuries.” “Each century behaves as
  though it were\n                    the first.”\n                During the seventeenth
  century Nicolas Boileau-\n                        Despréaux was considered to be
  the foremost French\n                    theoretician of classicism and defender
  of the Ancients. In his Critical Reflections on Longinus (1694), he\n                    emphasized
  what he considered to be one of the strongest arguments in favor\n                    of
  ancient writers, the constant admiration in which they have\n                    continually
  been held; a sure and infallible proof, he felt, that they\n                    should
  always be admired. Yet he also admitted in a letter to Perrault,\n                    published
  by the latter in 1701, that although no French Cicero or Vergil\n                    had
  yet appeared, the Age of Louis XIV had surpassed any previous age\n                    in
  tragedy, painting, architecture, and especially in philosophy and\n                    science.
  He virtually abandoned the ancients when he admitted,\n                    “the
  Age of Louis XIV is not only comparable but superior to the\n                    most
  famous ages of antiquity, even the Age of Augustus.” Had\n                    the
  debate depended on authority alone, Boileau's ca- pitulation would have meant the
  total victory of the\n                    moderns at least in France, but other
  critics continued to exalt the\n                    preeminence of the ancients
  as still others disparaged them.\n                Abbé Jean Terrasson in a posthumous
  work, Philoso- phy Applicable to All\n                    Subjects (1754), affirmed
  that the superiority of the moderns is a\n                    necessary and natural
  effect of the very constitution of the human\n                    spirit. Fontenelle
  was wrong, he believed, in resting the argument on\n                    a comparison
  between trees in various centuries. Since trees in all ages\n                    remain
  the same, the parallel merely places the moderns on an equal\n                    plane
  with the ancients. Men, unlike trees, endow their progeny with\n                    their
  knowledge and advice. The prog- ress of\n                    the human spirit Terrasson
  illustrated with the old allegory of the human\n                    race as a single
  man. Instead of accepting such a system, which provides us\n                    infants
  for teachers and models, Terrasson exhorted us to re- spect our nephews over our
  ancestors. Our\n                    progeny will inevitably have greater enlightenment
  than we ourselves.\n                This is not far from the confident assertion
  of M. J. de Condorcet in his\n                        Historical Sketch of the Progress
  of the Human\n                    Mind (1793) that no limit can be pre-080\n                    \n
  \                   scribed to the improvement of the human species. Observations\n
  \                   of various races of lower animals had demonstrated to Condorcet's\n
  \                   satisfaction, long before Darwin, that improvement in physical
  faculties\n                    could be transmitted from one generation to the next.
  Human beings, he\n                    reasoned, could also pass on to their progeny
  that part of their physical\n                    organism on which their intelligence,
  mental energy, and moral\n                    sensibility depend, and proper education
  could bring about\n                    modification and unlimited improvement of
  these qualities.\n                In England after Bacon's initial attack on authority
  in science, the debate\n                    shifted to literary theory. Most late
  seventeenth-century literary critics\n                    limited them- selves to
  discussing the\n                    Aristotelian rules without mentioning the Stagirite's
  outmoded science.\n                    Dryden, for example, constantly vacillated
  between adhering to the\n                    rules and violating them. He admired
  Shake-\n                    speare, but condemned him by the rules; he praised Milton,
  but\n                    placed Homer and Vergil higher. In open- ing a\n                    complimentary
  address to his “Honour'd Friend Dr.\n                    Charleton” (1663), however,
  he declared,\n                        \n                            The longest
  Tyranny that ever sway'dWas that wherein our Ancestors betray'dTheir free-born Reason
  to the Stagirite.\n                     One of the few Restoration critics unequivocally
  to repudiate slavish\n                    obeisance to the ancients was Charles
  Gildon, who in Miscellaneous Letters and Essays (1694) drew the parallel with\n
  \                   scientific knowledge. He con- sidered it\n                    beyond
  doubt that the Greeks were far behind the moderns in physics and\n                    other
  sciences, which for the ancients “chiefly consisted in\n                    words.”
  Since authority had been for many years considered\n                    as a deterrent
  to scientific inquiry he could see no reason why his\n                    contemporaries
  not only continued to accept it but blindly followed it in\n                    poetry
  “since 'tis perhaps almost as prejudicial to our\n                    imitation
  of Nature in This, as to our discovery of it in the\n                    Other.”\n
  \               The French had debated the relative merits of the French language
  and the\n                    classical ones, the moderns unequivocally affirming
  the superiority of\n                    their own tongue. The English Restoration
  critics, however, accepted\n                    the theory that English had been
  a barbarous language until their own\n                    times, and even the most
  vigorous moderns in England granted the\n                    preference to classical
  idioms. Addison went so far as to assert in\n                    the Spectator (No.
  417) that if “Paradise Lost falls short of the Aeneid or Iliad, it proceeds from
  the\n                    fault of the language in which it is written.... So divine
  a poem in\n                    English is like a stately palace built of brick.”
  Later David\n                    Hume suggested that if “Waller had been born in
  Rome during the\n                    reign of Tiberius, his first productions had
  been despised, when compared\n                    to the\n                     finished
  odes of Horace” (“Of the Rise and\n                    Progress of the Arts and
  Sciences” [1742]).\n                In England, the formal controversy broke out
  in full force in 1690 when Sir\n                    William Temple published An
  Essay upon Ancient and Modern\n                        Learning, asserting the superiority
  of the ancients in every area\n                    and deny- ing that the moderns
  profit from their\n                    inheritance. According to his argument, learning
  which is derived may\n                    weaken invention and dilute genius. “So
  a Man that only\n                    Translates, shall never be a Poet, nor a Painter
  that only copies, nor a\n                    Swimmer that swims always with Bladders.”
  A few pages later he\n                    inconsistently demolished this argument
  by attributing the revival of\n                    learning in the modern world
  to the restoration of Greek and pure Latin\n                    after the Middle
  Ages.\n                Temple adapted the single man metaphor to his purpose by
  imagining a strong\n                    and vigorous man who should at the age of
  thirty fall ill and decline\n                    until sixty when he should recover
  and then be more vigor- ous than most men of this age. Although it could be\n                    said
  that he had grown more in strength during the ten years from 60 to 70\n                    than
  at any other period, he had still not acquired more strength and vigor\n                    than
  he had possessed at the age of thirty. Temple similarly\n                    interpreted
  the giant-dwarf image to the detriment of the moderns. As\n                    Temple
  viewed it, the dwarf, despite his advantageous position, sees less\n                    than
  the giant if he is naturally shorter-sighted, if he is less\n                    observant,
  or if he is dazzled by height.\n                By speculating on the possibility
  that our ancients had their own ancients\n                    with a period of intellectual
  stagnation intervening between them and their\n                        fore- runners,
  a period comparable to\n                    the Middle Ages, Temple introduced a
  cyclical theory of history\n                    refuting the idea of progress. According
  to his reasoning, the arts\n                    and sciences came to the West from
  India and perhaps ultimately from China.\n                    For information to
  support this theory—although not the theory\n                    itself— Temple
  relied upon two major sources, Thomas\n                    Burnet's Telluris theoria
  sacra (Sacred Theory of the Earth, 1681-89) and John Nieuhoff's Voyages and Travels
  into Brasil (1682). The cyclical\n                    theory itself was current
  in the Renaissance and had been refuted by\n                    Bacon.\n                William
  Wotton answered Temple in Reflections upon Ancient\n                        and
  Modern Learning (1694), a lengthy treatise, covering all\n                    phases
  of the arts and sciences, which draws heavily upon Perrault for the\n                    arts
  and on the defenders of the Royal Society for the sciences. Quite\n                    moderate
  in his advocacy of the moderns, Wotton refused to follow\n                    Fontenelle
  in claiming supe- riority for his\n                    own times in oratory and
  the arts. With impressive logic he observed that\n                    values in
  the arts are based upon opinion and are subject to debate;081\n                     whereas
  values in the sciences are objective and may be\n                    ascertained
  by comparison. In the second edition of his Reflections (1697), Wotton added an
  appendix by a noted scholar,\n                    Richard Bentley, who shifted the
  controversy to the area of philological\n                    scholarship.\n                Bentley
  used his linguistic learning to prove that the Greek works of\n                    Phalaris
  and Aesop, which Temple had extolled as ancients were spurious and\n                    really
  composi- tions of modern times.\n                    Charles Boyle joined the fray
  against Bentley, and finally Swift, as a\n                    partisan of Temple
  and the ancients, produced a masterful satire on\n                    the entire
  controversy, The Battle of the Books\n                    (1704). Swift's mock epic
  in prose casts the books in St. James Library\n                    arrayed in two
  armies, Moderns and Ancients, disputing a plot of ground on\n                    Mount
  Parnas- sus. The spirit of the work is\n                    succinctly conveyed
  by one of its mock-epic conventions: the episode of\n                    the spider
  and the bee. The two insects, representing Mod- erns and Ancients respectively,
  argue over which of\n                    the two is regarded by the outside world
  as the superior creature. The\n                    spider affirms that the bee is
  a plunderer of nature, stealing from every\n                    variety of flower;
  whereas the spider himself is a domestic animal erect- ing his dwelling entirely
  through his own\n                    efforts and with materials extracted from his
  own person. The bee\n                    admits ranging over field and garden, but
  asserts that his collecting of\n                    nectar does no harm to the flowers
  he visits; whereas the spider pours out\n                    poison from his breast
  to spin his web, which perpetually gathers dirt\n                    and sweepings.
  Aesop, who is chosen to moderate the dispute, decides in\n                    favor
  of the bee, whom he associates with himself as an Ancient.\n                \n                    Whatever
  we have got, has been by infinite labour and search, and\n                        ranging
  through every corner of nature; the difference is that, instead\n                        of
  dirt and poison, we have rather chosen to fill our hives with honey\n                        and
  wax, thus furnishing mankind with the two noblest of things, which\n                        are
  sweetness and light.\n                \n                Bacon had preceded Swift
  in the image of the spider and Ben Jonson in the\n                    image of the
  bee, and Temple had vastly extended the latter in an essay Of Poetry (1690). Matthew
  Arnold later adopted the\n                    metaphor “sweetness and light” as
  the symbol of\n                    classical culture in a famous essay defending
  it, Culture\n                        and Anarchy (1869).\n                Diderot,
  a moderate in the controversy, allegorized the quarrel of ancients\n                    and
  moderns somewhat in the vein of the episode of the spider and the bee\n                    in
  a digression inserted in a licentious novel written for the\n                    amusement
  of his mistress, Les Bijoux indiscrets\n                    (1748). One of the characters
  in a dream finds himself accom- panied by the Goddess Minerva in a\n                    gallery
  of statues and books symbolizing the ancients. A crowd of men\n                     burn
  incense and adorn the statues with garlands, at the same\n                    time
  abusing those of their number who fail to bow profoundly enough before\n                    the
  statues. These are succeeded by a horde of pygmies, who hack at\n                    the
  statues and try to tear them apart. Minerva explains that this\n                    quarrel
  has been going on for a long time, and always to the disadvantage\n                    of
  the pygmies. The statues run some risk of being tarnished by the\n                    incense
  of the worshippers, she explains, but the efforts of the\n                    pygmies
  to destroy them only make them more bril-\n                        liant.\n                Swift,
  in a companion piece to his Battle of the Books, A\n                        Tale
  of the Tub (1704), ironically pointed to Homer's gross\n                    ignorance
  of the laws of England and the doctrines of the Anglican Church\n                    as
  a means of repudiating the moderns' method of judging Homer by the\n                    standards
  of a later and more sophisticated age than his. Similarly he\n                    ridiculed
  the moderns as critics whose art consisted merely in the\n                    discovering
  and collecting of faults. “Their imaginations are so\n                    entirely
  possessed and replete with the defects of other\n                    pens,” he charged,
  “that the very quintessence of\n                    what is bad does of necessity
  distil into their own.”\n                The method of subjecting Homer to the test
  of verisimilitude and good taste\n                    was applied in earnest by
  La Motte and Terrasson. The former condemned\n                    such “low” images
  as Achilles' asking Thetis to\n                    remove the flies from the wounds
  of Patroclus; the latter found fault\n                    because the Iliad does
  not conform to rational\n                    principles of stylistic organization;
  because the action does not adhere to\n                    the theme of the work;
  and because Agamemnon commits capital crimes against\n                    religion
  and justice. The strong implication of both La Motte and\n                    Terrasson
  was that Homer was as much a barbar-\n                    ian as a poet. The principle
  argument of La Motte was that Homer\n                    must be subjected to the
  judgment of reason and not accepted as the voice\n                    of authority.
  In his opinion, the only pleasures which Homer provides\n                    are
  those based on novelty, on antiquarianism, on re-\n                        spect
  for authority, and on prejudice. None of these have any\n                    relation
  to reason, the single quality on which aesthetic appreciation\n                    should
  be based (Discours sur\n                    Homère, 1714). La Motte admitted that
  it was illogical\n                    to attack Homer for not conforming to the
  dignity of later ages. But he\n                    insisted that criticism had the
  right to condemn Homeric times for their\n                    barbarousness and
  to indicate that the description of them in the Iliad appeared disagreeable to the
  more fastidious\n                    standards of later ages.\n                In
  1716, Sir Richard Blackmore published “An Ac- count of the present controversy concerning
  Homer'sIliad,” in which he also refused to submit to\n                    the au-
  thority of ancient writers\n                    “unless they were supported by Reason.”
  He condemned\n                    the ludicrousness of rivers082\n                     making
  speeches and horses shedding tears and labelled the\n                    manners
  and behavior of the pagan Gods a re-\n                    proach to human nature.
  Yet he suggested that Féne- lon's highly praised modern prose epic, Télémaque, had
  many worse faults\n                    than the Iliad, particularly in the author's\n
  \                   introducing heathen machines and having Grecian pagans speak
  in the manner\n                    of Jews, Egyp- tians, and Chaldeans.\n                Pope
  in An Essay on Criticism (1711), however,\n                    returned to an almost
  unanswerable defense of the alleged blemishes in\n                    Homer—the
  argument of the French critics that they were\n                    intentional—designed
  to provide variety and to present his most\n                    sublime pas- sages
  in relief.\n                \n                    \n                        \n                            Those
  oft are stratagems which error seem,Nor is it Homer nods, but we that dream.\n                    \n
  \                   \n                        (I, 179-80)\n                    \n
  \               \n                This is a couplet based on Horace's The Art of
  Poetry\n                    (lines 359-60), but Pope's defense is stronger than
  Horace's. The latter\n                    merely suggests that soporific passages
  may be condoned in a poem which is\n                    very long.\n                The
  contention in England over the age of the writ-\n                        ings of
  Aesop and Phalaris, which was waged on lin- guistic grounds, had its counterpart
  in France in disa- greements over the theory of\n                    translation.
  Madame Dacier in the Preface to her translation of the Iliad (1711), argued that
  the more sublime and\n                    beautiful a work is in the original, the
  more it loses in translation.\n                    No writer suffers as much as
  Homer does, for it is impossible in French to\n                    communicate the
  harmony, nobility, and majesty of his expressions.\n                    Characterizing
  the French language as timid and circumspect because of\n                    its
  formality and blind adherence to custom, she condemned it for lacking\n                    the
  boldness and liberty necessary to reveal the beauties of Homer.\n                    Although
  she was a confirmed classicist, Mme Dacier, in defend- ing Homer, anticipated by
  a century the\n                    linguistic arguments of the romanticists which
  were based on freedom\n                    from restraint. Of Lucretius she remarked
  that his philosophy and\n                    principles were absurd and false, but
  that the verses in which they were\n                    expressed would charm every
  ear by their beauty and harmony.\n                Abbé La Motte replied in his Discours
  sur\n                        Homère (1714) that no one in the modern world could\n
  \                   know the dead languages well enough to appreciate their nuances
  and\n                    beauties. Those who prided themselves on understanding
  the beauties and\n                    negligences of Homer, that is, the bold strokes
  which his admirers\n                    praised him for, could have only an approximate
  knowledge of ancient Greek.\n                    These critics vaunted themselves
  for possessing knowledge of a\n                    language which they understood
  only partially and imperfectly.\n                     La Motte went even further
  and declared that the French\n                    language was the equal of Greek
  in beauty of expression. He found examples\n                    to illustrate its
  clarity in history, sublimity in panegyric, saltiness in\n                    satire,
  dignity in tragedy, naiveté in fable, and tenderness\n                    in opera.
  Each language, he maintained, has utilitarian communication\n                    as
  its function, and harmony and sonority are only secondary. It is only\n                    because
  French has kept itself within the limits of good sense and\n                    clarity
  that it can be reproached for lacking boldness. Audacious and\n                    daring
  terms exist in French speech, but if they should ever become\n                    commonplace,
  French would become degenerate and corrupt. It is\n                    precisely
  the good sense of the French language, La Motte insisted,\n                    which
  represents its greatest richness.\n                Because many French men of letters
  shared La Motte's pride in the French\n                    language, it was possible
  for the great French seventeenth-century\n                    authors eventually
  to displace the ancients as classic models in\n                    French culture.
  In England, the respect for the vernacular did not reach\n                    these
  heights, and as a result, English neo-classicism never attained the\n                    authority
  of the French.\n                Abbé Dubos took an eclectic position in his Critical
  Reflections on Poetry and Painting (1719), one of\n                    the major
  documents in the controversy, but on the ques- tion of translation he stood firmly
  with the\n                    ancients. It is form alone in Homer which gives pleasure,
  he affirmed,\n                    and therefore Homer must be translated ex-\n                    actly.
  But Dubos also maintained that no translation can do justice\n                    to
  the beauty of a poetic original since the rhythm and harmony of\n                    classical
  verse cannot be rendered in another language. The Aeneid in French is not the same
  poem as the Aeneid in Latin. Dubos argued, moreover, that those\n                    who
  cannot read an an- cient poem in the\n                    original must accept the
  judgment about it of those who can. One cannot\n                    rely on one's
  own appraisal of a translation no matter how rational\n                    the appraisal
  may be, since the translation and the original are different\n                    entities.
  The beauties of a poem are judged by sentiment, not reason, and\n                    “the
  general agreement of the senses of other men, is next to\n                    the
  agreement of our own, the most certain means we have of judging\n                    phenomena
  which are ranked under senti-\n                    ment.”\n                With
  these arguments Dubos was opposing those moderns like La Motte, who\n                    considered
  that the chief value of studying the ancients was to obtain\n                    historical
  and sociological information and that the purpose of\n                    criticism
  was to place an author in his philosophical and historical\n                    context.
  In rejecting sociological criti-\n                    cism, Dubos discounted the
  need for verisimilitude and historical\n                    accuracy in art. We
  do not read poetry to look for contradictions, he\n                    affirmed,
  but for the pleas-083\n                    \n                    ure of being moved
  emotionally. Holding that the only purpose\n                    of poetry is to
  excite sentiments, not to per-\n                    suade the reason, he considered
  it a matter of indiffer- ence whether a poem be completely contrary to real- ity.
  In his emphasis on sentiment,\n                    therefore, Dubos entirely abandoned
  the Cartesian theory of the\n                    advance of knowledge through reason.
  In his opinion, the greatest\n                    discoveries in science—the compass,
  the printing press, the\n                    weight of air, the movement of the
  earth, and the circulation of\n                    blood—came by chance, not by
  following rational procedures.\n                    Cartesian reason he affirmed
  produces nothing but absurd theories such\n                    as that of the beast
  machine. Sentiment and imagina- tion, therefore, are more important for progress,\n
  \                       ac- cording to Dubos, than reason.\n                The
  sociological criticism which Dubos opposed could be used, however, to\n                    the
  advantage of the An- cients.\n                    Fénelon in a Letter on the Activities
  of the\n                        Academy (1716), suggested that the deformity and
  crudeness of\n                    religion and the lack of true morality in Homeric
  times served to make\n                    Homer's artistic achievement all the more
  admirable by contrast. The\n                    great epic poet had portrayed with
  superb imagery and verbal power concepts\n                    which in themselves
  are absurd and shocking. Jean Bovin in his Apology for Homer (1715), made a comparison
  with\n                    China, which was emerging at that time as a popular theme.
  What he\n                    enjoyed in reading about China, he said, was Chinese
  customs.\n                    “If the heroes of the century of Homer do not resemble
  ours,\n                    this difference should give us pleasure.”\n                Although
  Giambattista Vico in Italy wrote his New\n                    Science (Scienza Nuova
  [1725; 1744]), with\n                    absolutely no reference to the critical
  dispute raging in France and\n                    England, the fundamental thought
  of his treatise completely contradicts\n                    those who attributed
  philo- sophical\n                    discrimination to the ancients. Vico believed
  that it was fear which first\n                    led men to create gods in their
  imaginations and that their first form of\n                    expression was poetical.
  Contrary to all the ancient philosophers,\n                    including Plato and
  Aristotle, Vico believed that “it was the\n                    deficiency of human
  reasoning power that gave rise to poetry,”\n                    and he concluded
  that his discovery of “the origins of poetry\n                    does away with
  the opinion of the matchless wisdom of the\n                    ancients.”\n                Addison
  in the Spectator (No. 160 [1711]), used Homer\n                    as his only example
  of natural genius in a distinction between the\n                    contributions
  to humanity which depend upon native inspiration alone and\n                    those
  which have depended upon accumulated experience. Those in the\n                    first
  category of genius have “... by the mere Strength of\n                    natural
  Parts, and without any Assist- ance\n                    of Art of Learning,...
  produced Works that were the Delight of their own\n                    Times and
  the Wonder of\n                     Posterity.” The second category, “formed\n                    themselves
  by Rules, and submitted the Greatness of their natural\n                    Talents
  to the Corrections and Restraints of Art.” Homer was\n                    Addison's
  single example of the first class, and Plato, Aristotle, Vergil,\n                    Cicero,
  Milton, and Bacon of the second. Abbé Dubos converted this\n                    distinction
  to one between ancients and moderns. He affirmed that the\n                    moderns
  are undoubtedly more advanced in the sciences, but their\n                    superiority
  depends on the prior accumulation of a mass of knowledge, not\n                    on
  genius. Modern reason, therefore, is not really superior to\n                    ancient.
  In the realm of art, moreover, time and expe- rience are of no value. The high esteem
  in which\n                    Homer is held, Dubos maintained, is not due to the
  reign of Aristotle and\n                    should not be reduced because the latter
  has fallen from favor; instead\n                    Homer's repu- tation is based
  entirely on the\n                    pleasure which people of all ages have found
  in his work.\n                Pope in An Essay on Criticism attempted to blur the\n
  \                   distinction between genius and acquired experience by affirming
  that to\n                    follow nature and to imitate the ancients is the same
  thing.\n                        \n                            Learn for ancient
  rules a just esteem;To copy nature is to copy them.\n                     Like most
  classicists, Pope advocated the imitation of the ancients in\n                    order
  to attain nature. His friend Edward Young, however, in Conjectures on Original Composition
  (1752),\n                    prescribed the opposite method. Instead of imitating
  Homer, the poet should\n                    imitate nature: “drink where he drank,
  at the true Helicon,\n                    that is, at the breast of nature.” Young
  recognized that in both\n                    science and the arts, the respect for
  authority inculcated by the ancients\n                    leads simply to imitation
  of their models and to acceptance of their\n                    beliefs. His theory
  is summarized by the paradox: “The less\n                    we copy the renowned
  ancients, we shall resemble them the\n                    more.” A Spanish critic
  G. M. Jovellanos in an essayOn the Necessity of Uniting the Study of Literature
  and\n                        the Sciences (1797), took his inspiration directly
  from Young in\n                    explaining why the moderns with much greater
  knowledge than the ancients\n                    nevertheless dis- played less genius:\n
  \                   “because the ancients created, and we imitate; because the\n
  \                   ancients studied nature, and we study them. Why do we not follow
  their\n                    track? And if we wish to equal them, why do we not study
  as they\n                    did?”\n                Diderot, however, in a highly-regarded
  critical essay,Salon de 1767, affirmed that precisely because\n                    the
  Greeks had based their artistic creation on nature, their work\n                    could
  never be excelled. “The inviolable laws of Nature must be\n                    executed;
  Nature does nothing by leaps and bounds, and this is no less true\n                    in
  the arts than in the cosmos.” Despite the possibility of going084\n                     directly
  to nature for models and inspiration, Diderot affirmed\n                    that
  it is impossible for modern artists ever to equal the\n                    ancients—they
  can only be imitators. Goethe in the section of\n                    his autobiography
  Poetry and Truth (Dichtung und Wahrheit, 1811-33), devoted to the\n                    “Antique
  and the Present,” reiterated and supported\n                    this view.\n                Marivaux
  in The Mirror (1755) offered an explanation\n                    of the paradox
  that literary works could be greater in ancient times than\n                    in
  modern despite the accumulation and proliferation of knowledge in the\n                    modern
  world. He maintained that ideas and taste are not parallel and,\n                    therefore,
  do not increase at the same rate. Each gen- eration which comes on the earth adds
  its own portion\n                    to the stock of ideas, and these never entirely
  disap- pear: their impression remains indelibly in\n                    humanity.
  But even though modern times may have a greater accumulation\n                    of
  ideas than existed in the past, there is unfortunately less of taste.\n                    The
  augmentation of ideas is an infallible consequence of the duration of\n                    the
  world, Marivaux concluded, but the art of employing those ideas in\n                    works
  of the spirit may decline—in which event belles lettres\n                    may
  sink, criticism and taste disappear. Marivaux concluded, therefore,\n                    that
  there had never been a period to equal that of the ancients.\n                Vauvenargues
  in his Discourse on the Character of Various\n                        Centuries
  (1745) made a parallel admission that ineffably greater\n                    knowledge
  is available in modern times than in the past, but he questioned\n                    whether
  the average man was capable of assimilating or utilizing this\n                    knowledge.
  As far as Vauvenargues was concerned, that which depends on the\n                    spirit
  receives no increase from the proliferation of the products of the\n                    intellect,
  and since taste depends on the spirit, knowledge is being\n                    increased
  in vain: “our judgment is instructed, but our taste is\n                    not
  improved.”\n                Even Turgot, one of the most ardent exponents of perfectibility,
  conceded\n                    that while the capacity for knowledge of the nature
  of truth is as infinite\n                    as truth itself, the development of
  the arts is as limited as man\n                    himself. Poetry, painting, and
  music have a fixed point determined by\n                    language and by the
  sensibility of our organs. This fixed point, Turgot\n                    believed,
  had been attained by the men of the Age of Augustus, who,\n                    therefore,
  will remain as models for all subsequent generations (Second Discourse... on the
  Progress of the Human\n                    Mind, 1750).\n                Abbé Terrasson
  refused to accept the separation of arts and\n                    sciences as valid
  in the measurement of human progress, condemning the\n                    division
  as artificial by means of an original variant of the single-man\n                    image.
  In a discourse with the pertinent title, Philosophy Applica- ble to all the\n                        objects
  of the Mind and Reason (1754), he affirmed that such a\n                    separation
  would perhaps be\n                     applicable to a creature with two souls,
  but it does not fit\n                    humanity. He maintained, moreover, that
  infe-\n                    rior as the ancients were in the sciences, they knew
  more about\n                    them, particularly geometry and astron- omy,\n                    than
  they knew about the true principles of reason and humanity,\n                    “unique
  source of the true use of belles-lettres in prose and\n                    poetry.”\n
  \               The first critic to suggest the possibility that the fine arts may
  progress,\n                    just as the sciences do, was Edward Young. As part
  of his campaign against\n                    the principle of imitation in literature,
  he urged poets not only to\n                    go beyond the ancients in representing
  nature, but even to go beyond nature\n                    itself and to develop
  a world of pure imagination. “In the\n                    fairyland of fancy,” he
  remarked in his Conjectures, “genius may wander wild; there it has\n                    creative
  power, and may reign arbitrarily over its own empire of\n                    chimeras.”
  This is the essence of the ultra-modern spirit, and\n                    Young himself
  recog- nized that it was partly\n                    rant. But he declared unequiv-
  ocally,\n                    “all arts and sciences are making considerable\n                    advance,”
  and he did not hesitate to ask, “why may\n                    not poetry go forward
  with this advancement?”\n                Condorcet, probably the most ardent “perfectibilian”\n
  \                   of the century, vigorously supported the view that progress
  occurs in the\n                    fine arts. In his Historical Sketch (1793) he
  made\n                    an original distinction between “that which belongs really
  to\n                    the progress of art and that which is due only to the talent
  of the\n                    artist.” In the past, he contended, critics had judged
  artists\n                    rather than works, giving rise to the adulation of
  the ancient authors\n                    and the growth of a cult requiring imitation
  of the first models. Although\n                    not making any aesthetic comparisons
  between specific ancient and modern\n                        au- thors, Condorcet
  affirmed that the arts\n                    are improved by and draw profit from
  advances in philosophy and\n                    science—either through more precise
  knowledge of the effects and\n                    powers of these arts themselves
  or through the destruction of prejudices\n                    against them. Reasoning
  such as this may have inspired the poet Shelley\n                    to speculate
  in the Preface to The Revolt of Islam\n                    (1817), that “there may
  be such a thing as perfectibility\n                    in works of fiction.”\n                This
  doctrine of perfectibility is related to the socio- logical criticism of La Motte
  since both systems\n                    assume that literature is as much a product
  of society as of\n                    individuals. The concept of the interaction
  of literature and society\n                    directly opposes all theories of
  absolute values, including that of the\n                    supremacy of the ancients.
  Mme de Staël fully developoed the\n                    concept in her pioneer treatise
  Literature Considered in\n                        Its Relations with Social Institutions
  (De la\n                        Littérature considerée dans ses rapports avec les\n
  \                       institutions sociales, 1800).\n                In Spain,
  ever since Luis Vives in the sixteenth century had used literary\n                    arguments
  against the doc-085\n                    \n                    trine of the degeneration
  of the world, critics in that\n                    country confidently extolled
  the originality and vigor of Spanish\n                    literature. During the
  middle of the eight-\n                    eenth century, however, a Dominican priest,
  Benito Jeronimo Feijoo,\n                    considered to be one of the most progressive
  as well as prolific minds in\n                    Spain at the time, published an
  essay “Resurrection of the Arts\n                    and Defense of the Ancients”
  (1750), taking a moderate\n                    position in the controversy, but
  leaning toward the side of the ancients.\n                    On the subject of
  the arts he asked: “What is there in our\n                    century which can
  compete with the beauties of the poetry and eloquence of\n                    the
  century of Augustus?” And with respect to the sciences\n                    he affirmed
  that if the stories told of the intellectual pene- tration of some of the ancients
  are\n                    true, “certainly one may infer that their physical knowledge
  was\n                    much superior to all the philosophers of these times.”
  Two\n                    of his examples of this penetration are revealing: Democritus
  was able\n                    merely by tasting milk to tell that it came from a
  black goat which had\n                    been pregnant only once. And the same
  philosopher, saluting a girl\n                    whom he had greeted the night
  before Salve virgo,\n                    used the words Salve mulier in the morning;\n
  \                   it was later discovered that she had been violated. Feijoo reflected\n
  \                   the point of view of Temple that the ancients really deserve
  the credit for\n                    many of the discoveries ascribed to the moderns,
  including circulation of\n                    the blood, the telescope, printing,
  and the compass. He insisted\n                    moreover that the first discovery
  of a principle or art is worthy of more\n                    praise than its subsequent
  develop- ment by\n                    the moderns.\n                In France the
  debate continued on scientific as well as aesthetic grounds.\n                    Father
  Noël Regnault, in hisAncient Origin of New Physics (L'Origine ancienne de la physique
  nouvelle [1734]), stressed\n                    the great debt which modern science
  owes to the ancients and argued\n                    that the improvements of his
  day would not have been possible without the\n                    ancients. A French
  Protestant clergyman, living in England, Louis Dutens,\n                    published
  in 1766 An Inquiry into the Origin of the\n                        Discoveries attributed
  to the Moderns: Wherein It is Demonstrated,\n                        That our most
  celebrated Philosophers have, for most part, taken what\n                        they
  advance from the Works of the Ancients, and that many important\n                        Truths
  in Religion were known to the Pagan Sages. Considering the\n                    works
  of his predecessors, Perrault, Fontenelle, Wotton, and Temple as\n                    comprising
  fine declamation and rhetoric rather than proofs or\n                    demonstrations,
  Dutens at- tempted to reveal\n                    the enormous share the ancients
  have had in “modern\n                    discoveries.” He followed Addison and Dubos
  in distinguishing\n                    between those arts and sciences “which require
  long experience\n                    and practice to bring them to perfection, and
  those which depend solely\n                    on talent and genius.” He admitted
  that the moderns have\n                     brought the former to higher stages
  of development, and that\n                    the Christian religion has even extended
  mo-\n                    rality itself. Also in the area of scientific inventions,
  he\n                    distinguished between the products of genius and philosophy
  and the\n                    “mere effects of chance, or the lucky hits of some
  ignorant\n                    artisans.” After including printing, gunpowder, and
  the compass\n                    in the category of lucky hits he tried to trace
  to the ancients the\n                    systems of logic and metaphysics of Descartes,
  Leibniz, Malebranche, and\n                    Locke; Buffon's theories of universal
  matter, generation, and nutrition:\n                    Newton's theory of colors;
  Harvey's theory of the circulation of blood;\n                    the plurality
  of worlds; the motion of the earth around the sun; and\n                    the
  sexual system of plants. On the subjects of architecture, sculpture,\n                    poetry,
  eloquence, and his- tory, Dutens took\n                    for granted the preeminence
  of the ancients, affirming that “The\n                    moderns themselves will
  not contest with them; on the contrary the height\n                    of their
  ambition is, to imitate them.” Dutens concluded\n                    that the ancients
  had preceded or prepared the way for the moderns\n                    “in almost
  all truths of the greatest importance.”\n                    Supporting the theory
  of Temple that the ancients had their own ancients,\n                    as well
  as commenting on the opinion of Perrault that recent discoveries\n                    had
  been so extensive that there was little left to be learned, he\n                    quoted
  Seneca concerning the future: “Had even everything been\n                    found
  out by the ancients, there would still this remain to be done anew,\n                    to
  put their inven- tions into use and make their knowledge ours” (Epistle 64). Though
  Dutens' work is today virtually\n                    unknown, it was widely circulated
  in its own time. John Wesley, for\n                    example, republished it in
  abridged form in later editions of his Survey of the Wisdom of God in Crea-\n                            tion—a
  text-book of popular science originally\n                        pub- lished in
  1763—which went\n                    through several editions in England and the
  United States. Summarizing his\n                    own impression, Wesley exclaimed:
  “Alas! how little new has\n                    been discovered, even by Gassendi,
  Malebranche, Mr. Locke, or Sir Isaac\n                    Newton! How plain is it,
  that in philosophy, as well as the course of human\n                    affairs,
  'there is nothing new under the sun.'”\n                A number of replies to this
  objection of the lack of novelty, which Wesley\n                    was quoting
  from Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament\n                    (1:9), were already
  in print. In order to discourage literary imitations,\n                    La Motte
  ridi- culed the concept that no new\n                    thoughts are possible and
  that the human mind had already imagined every- thing that could be said. He compared\n
  \                   ideas to the variety in human physiognomies and affirmed that\n
  \                   experience shows that no two men will ever be born who are exactly
  alike.\n                    In like manner, even though ideas may always follow
  certain common paths,\n                    there will always be infinite opportunity
  for original appli- cations (Discourse\n                        on Poetry [1707]).
  Marivaux in The086\n                         Mirror (1755) made exactly the same
  comparison and\n                    added as a further analogy that just as man
  has not discovered all the\n                    forms of which matter is susceptible,
  he has not exhausted all the ways of\n                    thinking and feeling.\n
  \               Dubos similarly argued that artists of genius do not use the works
  of their\n                    predecessors as models, but go directly to nature.
  “Nature is\n                    more abundant in differ- ent or varied\n                    subjects
  than the genius of artisans in ways of imitating them.”\n                    Dubos
  made the original observation, moreover, that particular subjects\n                    are
  compatible for the talents of particular artists, and that some\n                    subjects
  remain virtually untouched because no artist has yet discovered\n                    them.
  Thomas Paine charac-\n                    teristically scoffed in an essay in The\n
  \                       Pennsylvania Magazine (1775) that the notion that “We have
  found out everything has been the motto of\n                    every age,” and
  that this species of vanity was stronger among\n                    the ancients
  than the moderns. Combining chronological and cultural\n                    primitivism,
  he diverted himself by look- ing\n                    back and imagining “a circle
  of original Indians haranguing on\n                    the sublime perfection of
  the age.”\n                Voltaire associated the quarrel of ancients and mod-\n
  \                       erns with one of the most important scientific projects
  of the\n                    century, twin expeditions organized by the French Academy
  of Science to\n                    measure the latitude at the North Pole and at
  the Equator and thus to\n                    test Newton's hypothesis that the earth
  is flattened at the poles. In\n                    a congratulatory poem to the
  scientists (“A Messieurs de\n                    l'Académie des Sciences” [1738]),
  Voltaire\n                    unequivocally espoused the side of the moderns. Addressing
  the ancient\n                    Greeks, Voltaire bid them to be ashamed and embarrassed
  at their poor\n                    performance in contrast to the great exploits
  of his contemporaries.\n                    “Your century” he declared “is vanquished
  by\n                    the century in which we are.” According to Voltaire, opin-
  ion in the past had universally favored the\n                    Greeks, only because
  it had been in bondage to lies and prejudices. In\n                    a note to
  his poem, Voltaire reaffirmed the parallel between science and\n                    literature,
  but his examples reveal his own prejudices. He declared that\n                    two
  minor French musical tragedies, Alcine and Armide, were worth more than all Greek
  poetry put\n                    together and that Thales and Pythagoras were not
  fit to study under\n                    Newton. “But the first-comers seized the
  Temple of Glory,\n                    time confirmed their claim, and the late-comers
  find the area\n                    occupied.” In one of his tales, “The World as
  It\n                    is” (1746) Voltaire insisted that the first efforts in\n
  \                   every art are always crude despite the preference which critics\n
  \                   stubbornly accord to the ancients over the mod-\n                    erns.
  In his seminal history The Century of Louis\n                    XIV (1752), he
  unequivocally asserted “the prodigious su- periority of our century over the\n                    ancients”
  and added that at least as far as philosophy is\n                    concerned the\n
  \                    dispute is definitely decided in favor of the moderns. In a\n
  \                   later dialogue bearing the title Ancients and\n                    Moderns
  (1765), Voltaire retreated to the more moder- ate position of Fontenelle that the
  controversy\n                    could best be resolved by granting that the modern
  world had\n                    discovered new laws of physics, but had not improved
  upon the ancients'\n                    rules of eloquence.\n                Oliver
  Goldsmith maintained that there exists no real basis of comparison\n                    between
  ancients and moderns, calling in question, in his An Enquiry into the Present State
  of Polite Learning (1759), the\n                    commonplace that nature is always
  the same. According to Goldsmith,\n                    both ancients and moderns
  imitated nature as they found it, but nature was\n                    different
  for each culture. Both ancients and moderns should then be\n                    considered
  excel- lent in their separate\n                    imitations. Homer would have
  been despised by the Greeks if he had written\n                    like Milton,
  and Milton would have been ridiculous if he had adopted\n                    Homer's
  religion. One should not con- demn\n                    Plautus for failing to depict
  characters like Molière's, nor the\n                    reverse. To do so would
  be as absurd as condemning “a geographer\n                    for not introducing
  more rivers, or promontories, into a country, than\n                    nature had
  given it; or the natural historian, for not enlivening his\n                    description
  of a dead landscape with a torrent, cataract, or a\n                    volcano.”\n
  \               For Herder in Germany, it was not precisely nature which changes
  from one\n                    chronological period to an- other, but national\n
  \                   cultures which differ one from another. Classical art he described,
  in an\n                    essay Homer und Ossian (1795), as an\n                    expression
  of national, cultural and social conditions which no longer\n                    exist
  in the modern world. Imitations of ancient art, therefore, are\n                    false
  and without soul since they do not express the emotions of the\n                    artist.
  According to Herder, a German poet of the eighteenth century cannot\n                    create
  ancient art just as an apple tree cannot bear pears.\n                Herder argued
  moreover in his Philosophy of the History of\n                        the Development
  of Mankind (Philosophie der\n                        Geschichte zur Bildung der
  Menschheit [1774]) that just as\n                    there exists no “absolute”
  human being, but all\n                    members of the human race differ one from
  another, there can be no one\n                    historical form of culture—the
  ancient or any\n                    other—which can be made as an “abso- lute ideal.”
  The classic norm forced the poet\n                    to be an imitator, not a creator.
  Herder, like Goldsmith, was a\n                    moderate. He did not try to elevate
  either the ancient or the modern world\n                    over the other, but
  he agreed with virtually all of his predecessors on the\n                    side
  of the moderns that the artist should follow his own inspira- tion or native talent
  rather than the\n                    standards or models of the past.\n                New
  impetus for studying and understanding the ancients came during the\n                    second
  half of the eighteenth087\n                     century in the wake of extensive
  excavations and archeological\n                    investigations, which led to
  a Greek Revival in art and architecture. The\n                    movement was most
  significant in Germany, giving rise to Winckel- mann's esthetic treatise, Thoughts
  concerning the Imi-\n                        tation of Greek Works in Painting and
  Sculpture (1755), in\n                    which he emphasized the artistic importance
  of simplicity, not merely that\n                    of nature, but that of the absolute
  or ideal. Schiller in the sixth of his\n                        Letters concerning
  the Esthetic Education of\n                    Mankind (1795) analyzed the civilization
  of the ancient Greeks\n                    and concluded that the form of culture
  it represented had then\n                    attained maximum development. Continued
  progress in culture, he felt, had\n                    to be based upon a split
  between intellect and feeling. In his most impor- tant critical work, On\n                        Naive
  and Sentimental Poetry (Über\n                        naive und sentimentalische
  Dichtung [1795-96]), he\n                    reformulated “the old Ancient-Modern
  debate by a new\n                    dichotomy,” in which he endeavored to justify
  his own art and\n                    modern art in general (René Wellek,History
  of Modern Criticism, I, 234). In Schiller's\n                    usage, naive refers
  to the mode of expression of the ancients based\n                    upon instantaneous
  reaction to primitive man-\n                    ners and the simplicity of nature;
  sentimental refers to the mode of\n                    expression of the moderns
  based upon an emotional attitude toward nature\n                    and manners,
  reconstructed in tranquility. The ancients portray only\n                    that
  which is happening at the moment; the moderns portray strong feelings\n                    conditioned
  by moral concepts and calm reflection. The moderns, ineffably\n                    below
  the ancients in everything related to nature, still have a\n                    better
  understanding of it. The ancients had conformed to nature, but the\n                    moderns
  in sophisticated society, by controlling nature, oppose it.\n                    Schiller
  granted the su- periority of the\n                    ancients in the plastic arts,
  where observation is paramount, but found the\n                    moderns su- perior
  in all areas based upon\n                    ideas where reflection is supreme.\n

  \            Dictionary of the History of IdeasThe idea of progress, finding expression
  in many\n                    forms and levels, was most vociferously discussed during
  the\n                    eighteenth century in the literary quarrel of the an-\n
  \                       cients and moderns, which embraced questions of au- thority,
  antiquarianism, and the new experimental sci- ence. The attack on authority in science
  and\n                    literary criticism first foreshadowed and later paralleled
  the\n                    challenging of authority in religion and politics, which
  developed during\n                    the Enlightenment in systems of deism and
  political democracy.Most of the arguments in favor of modern learning as opposed
  to ancient grew\n                    out of the efforts of Descartes and Bacon to
  persuade their respective\n                    countrymen to adopt a new method
  of judging and seeking truth. Both\n                    rejected the authority of
  the an- cients in\n                    scientific questions—Bacon as part of his
  inductive method and\n                    Descartes as part of his system of “methodical\n
  \                   doubt.” Descartes asserted in the first article, The Passions
  of the Mind (1649):What the ancients have taught is so scanty and for the most part
  so\n                        lacking in credibility that I may not hope for any kind
  of approach\n                        toward truth except by rejecting all the paths
  which they have\n                        followed.Aristotle, was first attacked
  and discredited in the realm of science, and\n                    then disputed
  in literature. Homer developed as another natural target.\n                    Critics
  assumed that if they could sufficiently tarnish his image,\n                    they
  would succeed in proving the superiority of the modern age.Abbé Pons in France,
  for example, praised Descartes for subjecting\n                    the scientific
  system of Aristotle to rigid scrutiny and exposing the\n                    latter's
  deviations from truth. Then he pointed to the parallel between the\n                    long
  reign of Aristotle in science and that of Homer in literature. He\n                    argued
  in his Letter on the “Iliad” of La Motte (Lettre sur “l'Iliade” de la Motte,\n                    1714)
  that the rejec- tion of Aristotle\n                    furnished a presentiment
  of the immi- nent fall\n                    of Homer. Two years later, the English
  poetEven after Aristotle had been dethroned in the realm of science, it remained\n
  \                   difficult to budge Homer from his pedestal. Critical opinion
  in the late\n                    seventeenth century generally agreed with Boileau
  that since Homer had\n                    been constantly admired and followed throughout
  the ages, he should always\n                    continue to be admired and imitated.
  The abbé Terrasson,\n                    however, in his Critical Dissertation on
  the\n                        “Iliad” (Dissertation\n                        critique
  sur “l'Iliade,” 1715) revolted against\n                    this logic. For him,
  literary work should not be judged according to\n                    the reputation
  it had enjoyed in the past, but ac-\n                        cording to its conformity
  to reason and nature. Literary\n                    criticism, according to Terrasson,
  should adopt the philosophic spirit\n                    which had been responsible
  for progress in the natural sciences,\n                    acknowledging the superiority
  of “reason which leads us to\n                    attribute each phenomenon to its
  proper and natural principle,”\n                        in- dependent of the opinion
  of other\n                    men. Blackmore said essentially the same:It's clear,
  that Aristotle form'd all his Axioms and\n                        Doctrines in Poetry,
  from the Patterns of Homer and other Greek\n                        Writers; and
  without assigning any Reason of his Positions. ... But it\n                        is
  not the Authority of the greatest Masters, but solid and convincing\n                        Evidence,
  that must engage our Belief.The debate concerned not only the two separate issues
  of which age possessed\n                    greater genius or mental powers and
  which possessed greater knowledge,\n                    but also a far more important
  one; did an increase of knowledge mean\n                    progress? This is another
  way of asking whether people are actually happier\n                    in the modern
  world. The partisans of the ancients were obviously\n                    accepting
  a form of cultural primitivism. Some men who did not profess any\n                    form
  of primitivism, nevertheless considered the new science as\n                    nothing
  more than an interesting development, which did nothing to\n                    change
  man's nature or to make him any happier. Others justified their\n                    indifference
  to the ques- tion by appealing to\n                    the commonplace observation
  of the century—that human nature\n                    never changes. Lord Chesterfield,
  for example, prided himself on the dis- covery “that nature was the same\n                    three
  thousand years ago as it is at present; that men were but men\n                    then
  as well as now.” He was willing to grant that modes and\n                    customs
  often vary, but insisted that “human nature is always\n                    the same.”
  Taking a common- place\n                    metaphor, originally introduced by Montaigne,
  he argued in a letter to his\n                    son, 7 February 1749, that there
  is no more reason to assume that men were\n                     better, braver,
  or wiser in ancient times than “to sup- pose that the animals or vegetables were\n
  \                   better then than they are now.” La Bruyère in another\n                    famous
  analogy, from his Caractères (1687),\n                    compared authors who espoused
  the side of the moderns to robust\n                    infants who suck the nourishing
  milk of their nurses and then revolt\n                    and beat them.The major
  disputants in the quarrel between ancients and moderns made use of\n                    three
  primary metaphorical expressions which passed from pen to pen\n                    without
  acknowledgment: (1) the paradox that modern men are the real\n                    ancients;
  (2) the image of the human race as a single man; and (3) the\n                    image
  of a giant with a dwarf on his shoulders.(1) The paradox concerning the antiquity
  of modern men derives from Bacon,\n                    who expressed it in Latin,Antiquitas
  saeculi juventus mundi\n                    (“Ancient times are the youth of the
  world”). Our\n                    times then are the an- cient times\n                    “when
  the world is ancient and not those which we account\n                        ordine
  retrogrado by a computation\n                    backward from ourselves.” The same
  paradox may be found in\n                    Descartes, Pascal, and Malebranche.
  TheEncyclopédie, in the article,\n                        “Anciens,” called it\n
  \                   an ingenious sophism, equivalent to the pleasantry, le monde
  est si vieux qu'il radote (“the world is\n                    so old it drivels”).
  In the last decade of the eighteenth\n                    century, Thomas Paine
  gave the argument a political twist inThe Rights of Man (1791) in order to discredit\n
  \                   Burke's concept of prescription. The only reason for studying\n
  \                   governments in the ancient world, as far as Paine was concerned,
  was to\n                    profit by their errors and to perceive later improvements
  by contrast.\n                    “Those who lived a hundred or a thousand years
  ago,”\n                    Paine affirmed, “were then moderns as we are now.”(2)
  The image of the human race as a single man compared the life span of\n                    the
  entire human race to one man's progress from cradle to grave. It exists\n                    in
  both Roger Bacon and Francis Bacon and in all the major\n                    participants
  in the ancient-moderns dispute. The figure could be used by\n                    one
  side to show that the race was already approaching senility, and by the\n                    other
  side to characterize the ancients as infants.(3) The giant-dwarf image represents
  the ancients as giants supporting the\n                    moderns as dwarfs on
  their shoulders so that the latter may have an\n                    advantageous
  view of nature. The metaphor figured prominently during\n                    the
  Renaissance in the writing of the Spaniard, Juan Luis Vives\n                    (1492-1540),
  and in Ben Jonson (1572-1637), and was reintroduced by\n                    Fontenelle.
  This image may also be used to support either side of the\n                    controversy:
  the ancients interpreted the puny figure of the modern dwarf\n                    as
  a sign of decay, but the mod- erns considered\n                    his advantageous
  position as a symbol of the superior knowledge of modern\n                    times.The
  debate was introduced into the literary realm by Alessandro Tassoni in\n                    the
  last of his Ten Books of Miscellaneous Thoughts\n                        (Dieci
  libri di pensieri diversi [1620]).\n                    In theory he seemed to favor
  the ancients by attacking the argument that\n                    knowledge is cumulative
  and that, therefore, it must always be the latest\n                        gener-
  ation which has the greatest\n                    amount of it. Such reason- ing,
  he affirmed,\n                    would hold only if study and research were continuously
  carried on by\n                    outstanding minds, but in actuality learning
  has frequently been\n                    captured by hostile forces or inferior
  intellects and thus learning\n                    may decline instead of advance.
  In his pragmatic sur-\n                        vey of the concrete achievements
  of civilization, how- ever, Tassoni acknowledged the superiority of the\n                    moderns.
  It follows from Tassoni's arguments that progress does not need to\n                    take
  place in a straight line, but it may occur in spurts and jumps; some\n                    areas
  may go forward while others go backwards, and there may even be\n                    occasional
  periods of total retrogression.In France, the preliminary skirmishes began in 1635,
  when a minor poet,\n                    Boisrobert, who had probably read Tassoni
  in translation, attacked the\n                    ancients before the French Academy.
  He was followed by Desmarets de\n                    Saint-Sorlin who argued passionately
  in his Discourse to\n                        Prove That Only Christian Subjects
  are Appropriate to Heroic\n                    Poetry (Discours pour prouver que
  les sujets\n                        chrétiens sont seuls propres à la poésie\n                        héroïque
  [1673]), that Christian miracles\n                    are far superior to pagan
  my- thology as\n                    subjects for heroic poetry. Although the dispute
  over the use of Christian\n                    subject matter in the epic tradition
  developed in England as a\n                    separate contest, completely independent
  of that between the ancients\n                    and moderns, the two contests
  are themati-\n                    cally related. The advocates of Christian poetry
  took up their\n                    position with the moderns, for the substitution
  of Christian materials for\n                    the classical deities represents
  a triumph of the contemporary world over\n                    the past. Desmarets
  maintained that the epic poet must be not only a\n                    story-teller,
  but also an authority on “history, geography,\n                    astronomy, matters
  of nature, logic, ethics, rhetoric, fables, agriculture,\n                    architecture,
  painting, sculpture, perspective, and music.” This\n                    requirement
  of extensive knowledge for the epic poet obviously put the\n                    ancients
  at a great disadvantage. John Dryden similarly required the epic\n                    poet
  to combine the “natu- ral\n                    endowments, of a large invention,
  a ripe judgment, and a strong\n                    memory” with “the knowledge of
  liberal arts and\n                    sciences, and particularly moral philosophy,
  the mathematics, geography,\n                    and history.”Carrying the controversy
  to the completely different area of linguistics,\n                    François Charpentier
  in 1683 pub-\n                    lished a treatise, On the Excellence of the French\n
  \                           Lan- guage (De\n                        l'Excellence
  de la langue française), arguing that\n                    modern French rather
  than the classical languages\n                     should be the medium for inscriptions
  on public monu- ments. Taking a position which Alexander\n                    Pope
  was to express a generation later in his satires, (First Epistle of the Second Book
  of Horace [1737]), and\n                    Marivaux in his Miroir (XI [1755]),
  Charpentier\n                    maintained that those who expressed a preference
  for the ancients did\n                    so because they were jealous of contemporary
  authors.In 1687 Charles Perrault united literary and scien-\n                        tific
  considerations in a poem exalting his own times,The Century of Louis XIV (Le\n                        Siècle
  de Louis le Grand) which he read before the\n                    Academy. The an-
  cients were great in their\n                    way, he admitted, but still had
  all the limitations of human beings. Homer\n                    had written under
  the disadvantages of living in a primitive society\n                    and, therefore,
  had fallen into various errors which he could have avoided\n                    had
  he written in the modern world. Without qualification Perrault\n                    affirmed
  that the ancient authorities in science and history,\n                    Aristotle
  and Herodotus, had already been discredited. As symbols of the\n                    scientific
  superiority of the moderns, Perrault featured in his poem a\n                    detailed
  description of the telescope and microscope. We may find\n                    close
  parallels to these passages in many French and English poems as\n                    well
  as in a Russian Georgic poem, Letter on the Use of\n                        Glass
  (1752) by M. V. Lomonosov.Perrault further developed his notions in a prose dialogue,
  Parallels between Ancients and Moderns (1688-96),\n                    not actually
  intended to show parallels, but instead differences and\n                    distinctions.
  For the gathering of ammunition against the ancients, he\n                    appealed
  to the astronomer Huygens, who supplied him with informa- tion concerning the advance
  of\n                    science. On the literary side Perrault repeated his charge
  that Homer\n                    and Vergil had been guilty of an infinite number
  of errors because\n                    they lacked knowledge which came to light
  in later times. As one example of\n                    Homer's great defi- ciencies,
  his lack of\n                    verisimilitude, Perrault pointed to the victory
  of Ulysses and three of his\n                    friends over 108 suitors of Penelope:
  the four warriors surmounting\n                    impossible odds to kill their
  foes without taking them by surprise, while\n                    Ulysses in the
  midst of the fray delivered a long moral discourse.Mme Dacier answered the objections
  to the errors and implausibilities of the\n                    ancients by affirming
  that whatever reproaches are made against Homer may\n                    be made
  equally against the Old Testament. In the preface to her\n                    translation
  of the Iliad (1711) she confined the\n                    argument to social customs
  rather than to scientific knowledge. The epic\n                    poet must portray
  customs and behavior exactly as they are in his own\n                    times;
  otherwise his imitation of nature will be false and his heroes\n                    no
  more credible than heroes of romances. “In a word, the\n                    poem
  imitates what exists and not that which has come into being only after\n                    it.”
  Since Homer could notIn 1688 Fontenelle published a volume of pastoral poetry in
  which he\n                    inserted a Digression sur les anciens et les\n                    modernes.
  Here he maintained that the question of the preeminence\n                    of
  ancients or moderns may be reduced to a consideration of whether the\n                    trees
  of former times were taller than those growing at present, a\n                    problem
  which had been presented by Montaigne in the Apologie de Raymond Sebond. This is
  a phase of the related\n                    theological doctrine of the degeneration
  of the world. Fontenelle argued\n                    that if biological differences
  exist in man as well as in plants,\n                    these differences are caused
  by geography and climate, not by\n                    chronology. And since the
  climate is essentially the same in Greece, Italy,\n                    and France,
  all human beings, including the ancients and moderns, Greeks,\n                    Romans,
  and French, are biologically equal. A scientist of mod- ern times, he affirmed,
  because of the\n                    accumulation of information knows ten times
  more than one of the times\n                    of Augustus, and he has ten times
  greater facility in acquiring his\n                    knowledge. The great reputation
  of the ancients is based upon prejudice and\n                    tradition. In literature,
  the names of the ancients sound better to\n                    our ears merely because
  they are Greek and Latin. Before Fontenelle,\n                    eloquence and
  poetry had been the main subjects of contention, but for him\n                    they
  counted less than the sciences. He admitted that the ancients\n                    could
  theoretically have attained perfection in elo-\n                        quence and
  poetry, but granted that they had actually attained\n                    it only
  in the former. Critics were accustomed to consider both Greeks and\n                    Romans
  as ancients, but Fontenelle affirmed that in a relative sense the\n                    Romans
  were moderns. In literary merit, he placed Cicero over\n                    Demosthenes,
  Vergil over both Theocritus and Homer, Horace over Pindar, and\n                    Livy
  over the Greek histori- ans. And he\n                    asserted for his contemporaries
  a further claim to\n                    superiority—that they had developed new
  literary forms like the\n                    novel, and the lettres galantes which
  had not\n                    existed in antiquity.Fontenelle also touched on the
  faults of Homer, which the latter's admirers\n                    had attempted
  to exonerate or vindicate under the plea of poetic license.\n                    Homer,
  for example, indiscriminately mingled as many as five dialects\n                    in
  a single line, a process equivalent to a French poet's blending the\n                    dialects
  of Picardy, Gas- cony, Normandy, and\n                    Brittany with ordinary
  French. Both Perrault and Fontenelle used the single\n                    man image,
  but the latter refused to carry the comparison to its\n                    logical
  end, resolutely affirming that the human race would never\n                    degenerate
  into senility.Fontenelle, nevertheless, had no illusions concerning the intrinsic
  merits\n                    of mankind, but shared the cautious\n                     skepticism
  of those who rejected the doctrine of prog- ress. In an imaginary dialogue between\n
  \                   Montaigne and Socrates (1683), he represents the former as charging,\n
  \                   in connection with the doctrine of universal degenera- tion,
  that men do not know how to use the\n                    knowledge they acquire.
  They are like birds too ignorant to stay away\n                    from a net which
  has already snared thousands of their kind. Pierre Bayle\n                    pessimistically
  observed in like vein in his Historical\n                        and Critical Dictionary
  (1695-97), that “the world is\n                    too undisciplined to profit from
  the maladies of former\n                    centuries.” “Each century behaves as
  though it were\n                    the first.”During the seventeenth century Nicolas
  Boileau-\n                        Despréaux was considered to be the foremost French\n
  \                   theoretician of classicism and defender of the Ancients. In
  his Critical Reflections on Longinus (1694), he\n                    emphasized
  what he considered to be one of the strongest arguments in favor\n                    of
  ancient writers, the constant admiration in which they have\n                    continually
  been held; a sure and infallible proof, he felt, that they\n                    should
  always be admired. Yet he also admitted in a letter to Perrault,\n                    published
  by the latter in 1701, that although no French Cicero or Vergil\n                    had
  yet appeared, the Age of Louis XIV had surpassed any previous age\n                    in
  tragedy, painting, architecture, and especially in philosophy and\n                    science.
  He virtually abandoned the ancients when he admitted,\n                    “the
  Age of Louis XIV is not only comparable but superior to the\n                    most
  famous ages of antiquity, even the Age of Augustus.” Had\n                    the
  debate depended on authority alone, Boileau's ca- pitulation would have meant the
  total victory of the\n                    moderns at least in France, but other
  critics continued to exalt the\n                    preeminence of the ancients
  as still others disparaged them.Abbé Jean Terrasson in a posthumous work, Philoso-
  phy Applicable to All\n                    Subjects (1754), affirmed that the superiority
  of the moderns is a\n                    necessary and natural effect of the very
  constitution of the human\n                    spirit. Fontenelle was wrong, he
  believed, in resting the argument on\n                    a comparison between trees
  in various centuries. Since trees in all ages\n                    remain the same,
  the parallel merely places the moderns on an equal\n                    plane with
  the ancients. Men, unlike trees, endow their progeny with\n                    their
  knowledge and advice. The prog- ress of\n                    the human spirit Terrasson
  illustrated with the old allegory of the human\n                    race as a single
  man. Instead of accepting such a system, which provides us\n                    infants
  for teachers and models, Terrasson exhorted us to re- spect our nephews over our
  ancestors. Our\n                    progeny will inevitably have greater enlightenment
  than we ourselves.This is not far from the confident assertion of M. J. de Condorcet
  in his\n                        Historical Sketch of the Progress of the Human\n
  \                   Mind (1793) that no limit can be pre-In England after Bacon's
  initial attack on authority in science, the debate\n                    shifted
  to literary theory. Most late seventeenth-century literary critics\n                    limited
  them- selves to discussing the\n                    Aristotelian rules without mentioning
  the Stagirite's outmoded science.\n                    Dryden, for example, constantly
  vacillated between adhering to the\n                    rules and violating them.
  He admired Shake-\n                    speare, but condemned him by the rules; he
  praised Milton, but\n                    placed Homer and Vergil higher. In open-
  ing a\n                    complimentary address to his “Honour'd Friend Dr.\n                    Charleton”
  (1663), however, he declared,The French had debated the relative merits of the French
  language and the\n                    classical ones, the moderns unequivocally
  affirming the superiority of\n                    their own tongue. The English
  Restoration critics, however, accepted\n                    the theory that English
  had been a barbarous language until their own\n                    times, and even
  the most vigorous moderns in England granted the\n                    preference
  to classical idioms. Addison went so far as to assert in\n                    the
  Spectator (No. 417) that if “Paradise Lost falls short of the Aeneid or Iliad, it
  proceeds from the\n                    fault of the language in which it is written....
  So divine a poem in\n                    English is like a stately palace built
  of brick.” Later David\n                    Hume suggested that if “Waller had been
  born in Rome during the\n                    reign of Tiberius, his first productions
  had been despised, when compared\n                    to the\n                     finished
  odes of Horace” (“Of the Rise and\n                    Progress of the Arts and
  Sciences” [1742]).In England, the formal controversy broke out in full force in
  1690 when Sir\n                    William Temple published An Essay upon Ancient
  and Modern\n                        Learning, asserting the superiority of the ancients
  in every area\n                    and deny- ing that the moderns profit from their\n
  \                   inheritance. According to his argument, learning which is derived
  may\n                    weaken invention and dilute genius. “So a Man that only\n
  \                   Translates, shall never be a Poet, nor a Painter that only copies,
  nor a\n                    Swimmer that swims always with Bladders.” A few pages
  later he\n                    inconsistently demolished this argument by attributing
  the revival of\n                    learning in the modern world to the restoration
  of Greek and pure Latin\n                    after the Middle Ages.Temple adapted
  the single man metaphor to his purpose by imagining a strong\n                    and
  vigorous man who should at the age of thirty fall ill and decline\n                    until
  sixty when he should recover and then be more vigor- ous than most men of this age.
  Although it could be\n                    said that he had grown more in strength
  during the ten years from 60 to 70\n                    than at any other period,
  he had still not acquired more strength and vigor\n                    than he had
  possessed at the age of thirty. Temple similarly\n                    interpreted
  the giant-dwarf image to the detriment of the moderns. As\n                    Temple
  viewed it, the dwarf, despite his advantageous position, sees less\n                    than
  the giant if he is naturally shorter-sighted, if he is less\n                    observant,
  or if he is dazzled by height.By speculating on the possibility that our ancients
  had their own ancients\n                    with a period of intellectual stagnation
  intervening between them and their\n                        fore- runners, a period
  comparable to\n                    the Middle Ages, Temple introduced a cyclical
  theory of history\n                    refuting the idea of progress. According
  to his reasoning, the arts\n                    and sciences came to the West from
  India and perhaps ultimately from China.\n                    For information to
  support this theory—although not the theory\n                    itself— Temple
  relied upon two major sources, Thomas\n                    Burnet's Telluris theoria
  sacra (Sacred Theory of the Earth, 1681-89) and John Nieuhoff's Voyages and Travels
  into Brasil (1682). The cyclical\n                    theory itself was current
  in the Renaissance and had been refuted by\n                    Bacon.William Wotton
  answered Temple in Reflections upon Ancient\n                        and Modern
  Learning (1694), a lengthy treatise, covering all\n                    phases of
  the arts and sciences, which draws heavily upon Perrault for the\n                    arts
  and on the defenders of the Royal Society for the sciences. Quite\n                    moderate
  in his advocacy of the moderns, Wotton refused to follow\n                    Fontenelle
  in claiming supe- riority for his\n                    own times in oratory and
  the arts. With impressive logic he observed that\n                    values in
  the arts are based upon opinion and are subject to debate;Bentley used his linguistic
  learning to prove that the Greek works of\n                    Phalaris and Aesop,
  which Temple had extolled as ancients were spurious and\n                    really
  composi- tions of modern times.\n                    Charles Boyle joined the fray
  against Bentley, and finally Swift, as a\n                    partisan of Temple
  and the ancients, produced a masterful satire on\n                    the entire
  controversy, The Battle of the Books\n                    (1704). Swift's mock epic
  in prose casts the books in St. James Library\n                    arrayed in two
  armies, Moderns and Ancients, disputing a plot of ground on\n                    Mount
  Parnas- sus. The spirit of the work is\n                    succinctly conveyed
  by one of its mock-epic conventions: the episode of\n                    the spider
  and the bee. The two insects, representing Mod- erns and Ancients respectively,
  argue over which of\n                    the two is regarded by the outside world
  as the superior creature. The\n                    spider affirms that the bee is
  a plunderer of nature, stealing from every\n                    variety of flower;
  whereas the spider himself is a domestic animal erect- ing his dwelling entirely
  through his own\n                    efforts and with materials extracted from his
  own person. The bee\n                    admits ranging over field and garden, but
  asserts that his collecting of\n                    nectar does no harm to the flowers
  he visits; whereas the spider pours out\n                    poison from his breast
  to spin his web, which perpetually gathers dirt\n                    and sweepings.
  Aesop, who is chosen to moderate the dispute, decides in\n                    favor
  of the bee, whom he associates with himself as an Ancient.Whatever we have got,
  has been by infinite labour and search, and\n                        ranging through
  every corner of nature; the difference is that, instead\n                        of
  dirt and poison, we have rather chosen to fill our hives with honey\n                        and
  wax, thus furnishing mankind with the two noblest of things, which\n                        are
  sweetness and light.Bacon had preceded Swift in the image of the spider and Ben
  Jonson in the\n                    image of the bee, and Temple had vastly extended
  the latter in an essay Of Poetry (1690). Matthew Arnold later adopted the\n                    metaphor
  “sweetness and light” as the symbol of\n                    classical culture in
  a famous essay defending it, Culture\n                        and Anarchy (1869).Diderot,
  a moderate in the controversy, allegorized the quarrel of ancients\n                    and
  moderns somewhat in the vein of the episode of the spider and the bee\n                    in
  a digression inserted in a licentious novel written for the\n                    amusement
  of his mistress, Les Bijoux indiscrets\n                    (1748). One of the characters
  in a dream finds himself accom- panied by the Goddess Minerva in a\n                    gallery
  of statues and books symbolizing the ancients. A crowd of men\n                     burn
  incense and adorn the statues with garlands, at the same\n                    time
  abusing those of their number who fail to bow profoundly enough before\n                    the
  statues. These are succeeded by a horde of pygmies, who hack at\n                    the
  statues and try to tear them apart. Minerva explains that this\n                    quarrel
  has been going on for a long time, and always to the disadvantage\n                    of
  the pygmies. The statues run some risk of being tarnished by the\n                    incense
  of the worshippers, she explains, but the efforts of the\n                    pygmies
  to destroy them only make them more bril-\n                        liant.Swift,
  in a companion piece to his Battle of the Books, A\n                        Tale
  of the Tub (1704), ironically pointed to Homer's gross\n                    ignorance
  of the laws of England and the doctrines of the Anglican Church\n                    as
  a means of repudiating the moderns' method of judging Homer by the\n                    standards
  of a later and more sophisticated age than his. Similarly he\n                    ridiculed
  the moderns as critics whose art consisted merely in the\n                    discovering
  and collecting of faults. “Their imaginations are so\n                    entirely
  possessed and replete with the defects of other\n                    pens,” he charged,
  “that the very quintessence of\n                    what is bad does of necessity
  distil into their own.”The method of subjecting Homer to the test of verisimilitude
  and good taste\n                    was applied in earnest by La Motte and Terrasson.
  The former condemned\n                    such “low” images as Achilles' asking
  Thetis to\n                    remove the flies from the wounds of Patroclus; the
  latter found fault\n                    because the Iliad does not conform to rational\n
  \                   principles of stylistic organization; because the action does
  not adhere to\n                    the theme of the work; and because Agamemnon
  commits capital crimes against\n                    religion and justice. The strong
  implication of both La Motte and\n                    Terrasson was that Homer was
  as much a barbar-\n                    ian as a poet. The principle argument of
  La Motte was that Homer\n                    must be subjected to the judgment of
  reason and not accepted as the voice\n                    of authority. In his opinion,
  the only pleasures which Homer provides\n                    are those based on
  novelty, on antiquarianism, on re-\n                        spect for authority,
  and on prejudice. None of these have any\n                    relation to reason,
  the single quality on which aesthetic appreciation\n                    should be
  based (Discours sur\n                    Homère, 1714). La Motte admitted that it
  was illogical\n                    to attack Homer for not conforming to the dignity
  of later ages. But he\n                    insisted that criticism had the right
  to condemn Homeric times for their\n                    barbarousness and to indicate
  that the description of them in the Iliad appeared disagreeable to the more fastidious\n
  \                   standards of later ages.In 1716, Sir Richard Blackmore published
  “An Ac- count of the present controversy concerning Homer'sIliad,” in which he also
  refused to submit to\n                    the au- thority of ancient writers\n                    “unless
  they were supported by Reason.” He condemned\n                    the ludicrousness
  of riversPope in An Essay on Criticism (1711), however,\n                    returned
  to an almost unanswerable defense of the alleged blemishes in\n                    Homer—the
  argument of the French critics that they were\n                    intentional—designed
  to provide variety and to present his most\n                    sublime pas- sages
  in relief.\n                        (I, 179-80)\n                    This is a couplet
  based on Horace's The Art of Poetry\n                    (lines 359-60), but Pope's
  defense is stronger than Horace's. The latter\n                    merely suggests
  that soporific passages may be condoned in a poem which is\n                    very
  long.The contention in England over the age of the writ-\n                        ings
  of Aesop and Phalaris, which was waged on lin- guistic grounds, had its counterpart
  in France in disa- greements over the theory of\n                    translation.
  Madame Dacier in the Preface to her translation of the Iliad (1711), argued that
  the more sublime and\n                    beautiful a work is in the original, the
  more it loses in translation.\n                    No writer suffers as much as
  Homer does, for it is impossible in French to\n                    communicate the
  harmony, nobility, and majesty of his expressions.\n                    Characterizing
  the French language as timid and circumspect because of\n                    its
  formality and blind adherence to custom, she condemned it for lacking\n                    the
  boldness and liberty necessary to reveal the beauties of Homer.\n                    Although
  she was a confirmed classicist, Mme Dacier, in defend- ing Homer, anticipated by
  a century the\n                    linguistic arguments of the romanticists which
  were based on freedom\n                    from restraint. Of Lucretius she remarked
  that his philosophy and\n                    principles were absurd and false, but
  that the verses in which they were\n                    expressed would charm every
  ear by their beauty and harmony.Abbé La Motte replied in his Discours sur\n                        Homère
  (1714) that no one in the modern world could\n                    know the dead
  languages well enough to appreciate their nuances and\n                    beauties.
  Those who prided themselves on understanding the beauties and\n                    negligences
  of Homer, that is, the bold strokes which his admirers\n                    praised
  him for, could have only an approximate knowledge of ancient Greek.\n                    These
  critics vaunted themselves for possessing knowledge of a\n                    language
  which they understood only partially and imperfectly.\n                     La Motte
  went even further and declared that the French\n                    language was
  the equal of Greek in beauty of expression. He found examples\n                    to
  illustrate its clarity in history, sublimity in panegyric, saltiness in\n                    satire,
  dignity in tragedy, naiveté in fable, and tenderness\n                    in opera.
  Each language, he maintained, has utilitarian communication\n                    as
  its function, and harmony and sonority are only secondary. It is only\n                    because
  French has kept itself within the limits of good sense and\n                    clarity
  that it can be reproached for lacking boldness. Audacious and\n                    daring
  terms exist in French speech, but if they should ever become\n                    commonplace,
  French would become degenerate and corrupt. It is\n                    precisely
  the good sense of the French language, La Motte insisted,\n                    which
  represents its greatest richness.Because many French men of letters shared La Motte's
  pride in the French\n                    language, it was possible for the great
  French seventeenth-century\n                    authors eventually to displace the
  ancients as classic models in\n                    French culture. In England, the
  respect for the vernacular did not reach\n                    these heights, and
  as a result, English neo-classicism never attained the\n                    authority
  of the French.Abbé Dubos took an eclectic position in his Critical Reflections on
  Poetry and Painting (1719), one of\n                    the major documents in the
  controversy, but on the ques- tion of translation he stood firmly with the\n                    ancients.
  It is form alone in Homer which gives pleasure, he affirmed,\n                    and
  therefore Homer must be translated ex-\n                    actly. But Dubos also
  maintained that no translation can do justice\n                    to the beauty
  of a poetic original since the rhythm and harmony of\n                    classical
  verse cannot be rendered in another language. The Aeneid in French is not the same
  poem as the Aeneid in Latin. Dubos argued, moreover, that those\n                    who
  cannot read an an- cient poem in the\n                    original must accept the
  judgment about it of those who can. One cannot\n                    rely on one's
  own appraisal of a translation no matter how rational\n                    the appraisal
  may be, since the translation and the original are different\n                    entities.
  The beauties of a poem are judged by sentiment, not reason, and\n                    “the
  general agreement of the senses of other men, is next to\n                    the
  agreement of our own, the most certain means we have of judging\n                    phenomena
  which are ranked under senti-\n                    ment.”With these arguments Dubos
  was opposing those moderns like La Motte, who\n                    considered that
  the chief value of studying the ancients was to obtain\n                    historical
  and sociological information and that the purpose of\n                    criticism
  was to place an author in his philosophical and historical\n                    context.
  In rejecting sociological criti-\n                    cism, Dubos discounted the
  need for verisimilitude and historical\n                    accuracy in art. We
  do not read poetry to look for contradictions, he\n                    affirmed,
  but for the pleas-The sociological criticism which Dubos opposed could be used,
  however, to\n                    the advantage of the An- cients.\n                    Fénelon
  in a Letter on the Activities of the\n                        Academy (1716), suggested
  that the deformity and crudeness of\n                    religion and the lack of
  true morality in Homeric times served to make\n                    Homer's artistic
  achievement all the more admirable by contrast. The\n                    great epic
  poet had portrayed with superb imagery and verbal power concepts\n                    which
  in themselves are absurd and shocking. Jean Bovin in his Apology for Homer (1715),
  made a comparison with\n                    China, which was emerging at that time
  as a popular theme. What he\n                    enjoyed in reading about China,
  he said, was Chinese customs.\n                    “If the heroes of the century
  of Homer do not resemble ours,\n                    this difference should give
  us pleasure.”Although Giambattista Vico in Italy wrote his New\n                    Science
  (Scienza Nuova [1725; 1744]), with\n                    absolutely no reference
  to the critical dispute raging in France and\n                    England, the fundamental
  thought of his treatise completely contradicts\n                    those who attributed
  philo- sophical\n                    discrimination to the ancients. Vico believed
  that it was fear which first\n                    led men to create gods in their
  imaginations and that their first form of\n                    expression was poetical.
  Contrary to all the ancient philosophers,\n                    including Plato and
  Aristotle, Vico believed that “it was the\n                    deficiency of human
  reasoning power that gave rise to poetry,”\n                    and he concluded
  that his discovery of “the origins of poetry\n                    does away with
  the opinion of the matchless wisdom of the\n                    ancients.”Addison
  in the Spectator (No. 160 [1711]), used Homer\n                    as his only example
  of natural genius in a distinction between the\n                    contributions
  to humanity which depend upon native inspiration alone and\n                    those
  which have depended upon accumulated experience. Those in the\n                    first
  category of genius have “... by the mere Strength of\n                    natural
  Parts, and without any Assist- ance\n                    of Art of Learning,...
  produced Works that were the Delight of their own\n                    Times and
  the Wonder of\n                     Posterity.” The second category, “formed\n                    themselves
  by Rules, and submitted the Greatness of their natural\n                    Talents
  to the Corrections and Restraints of Art.” Homer was\n                    Addison's
  single example of the first class, and Plato, Aristotle, Vergil,\n                    Cicero,
  Milton, and Bacon of the second. Abbé Dubos converted this\n                    distinction
  to one between ancients and moderns. He affirmed that the\n                    moderns
  are undoubtedly more advanced in the sciences, but their\n                    superiority
  depends on the prior accumulation of a mass of knowledge, not\n                    on
  genius. Modern reason, therefore, is not really superior to\n                    ancient.
  In the realm of art, moreover, time and expe- rience are of no value. The high esteem
  in which\n                    Homer is held, Dubos maintained, is not due to the
  reign of Aristotle and\n                    should not be reduced because the latter
  has fallen from favor; instead\n                    Homer's repu- tation is based
  entirely on the\n                    pleasure which people of all ages have found
  in his work.Pope in An Essay on Criticism attempted to blur the\n                    distinction
  between genius and acquired experience by affirming that to\n                    follow
  nature and to imitate the ancients is the same thing.Diderot, however, in a highly-regarded
  critical essay,Salon de 1767, affirmed that precisely because\n                    the
  Greeks had based their artistic creation on nature, their work\n                    could
  never be excelled. “The inviolable laws of Nature must be\n                    executed;
  Nature does nothing by leaps and bounds, and this is no less true\n                    in
  the arts than in the cosmos.” Despite the possibility of goingMarivaux in The Mirror
  (1755) offered an explanation\n                    of the paradox that literary
  works could be greater in ancient times than\n                    in modern despite
  the accumulation and proliferation of knowledge in the\n                    modern
  world. He maintained that ideas and taste are not parallel and,\n                    therefore,
  do not increase at the same rate. Each gen- eration which comes on the earth adds
  its own portion\n                    to the stock of ideas, and these never entirely
  disap- pear: their impression remains indelibly in\n                    humanity.
  But even though modern times may have a greater accumulation\n                    of
  ideas than existed in the past, there is unfortunately less of taste.\n                    The
  augmentation of ideas is an infallible consequence of the duration of\n                    the
  world, Marivaux concluded, but the art of employing those ideas in\n                    works
  of the spirit may decline—in which event belles lettres\n                    may
  sink, criticism and taste disappear. Marivaux concluded, therefore,\n                    that
  there had never been a period to equal that of the ancients.Vauvenargues in his
  Discourse on the Character of Various\n                        Centuries (1745)
  made a parallel admission that ineffably greater\n                    knowledge
  is available in modern times than in the past, but he questioned\n                    whether
  the average man was capable of assimilating or utilizing this\n                    knowledge.
  As far as Vauvenargues was concerned, that which depends on the\n                    spirit
  receives no increase from the proliferation of the products of the\n                    intellect,
  and since taste depends on the spirit, knowledge is being\n                    increased
  in vain: “our judgment is instructed, but our taste is\n                    not
  improved.”Even Turgot, one of the most ardent exponents of perfectibility, conceded\n
  \                   that while the capacity for knowledge of the nature of truth
  is as infinite\n                    as truth itself, the development of the arts
  is as limited as man\n                    himself. Poetry, painting, and music have
  a fixed point determined by\n                    language and by the sensibility
  of our organs. This fixed point, Turgot\n                    believed, had been
  attained by the men of the Age of Augustus, who,\n                    therefore,
  will remain as models for all subsequent generations (Second Discourse... on the
  Progress of the Human\n                    Mind, 1750).Abbé Terrasson refused to
  accept the separation of arts and\n                    sciences as valid in the
  measurement of human progress, condemning the\n                    division as artificial
  by means of an original variant of the single-man\n                    image. In
  a discourse with the pertinent title, Philosophy Applica- ble to all the\n                        objects
  of the Mind and Reason (1754), he affirmed that such a\n                    separation
  would perhaps be\n                     applicable to a creature with two souls,
  but it does not fit\n                    humanity. He maintained, moreover, that
  infe-\n                    rior as the ancients were in the sciences, they knew
  more about\n                    them, particularly geometry and astron- omy,\n                    than
  they knew about the true principles of reason and humanity,\n                    “unique
  source of the true use of belles-lettres in prose and\n                    poetry.”The
  first critic to suggest the possibility that the fine arts may progress,\n                    just
  as the sciences do, was Edward Young. As part of his campaign against\n                    the
  principle of imitation in literature, he urged poets not only to\n                    go
  beyond the ancients in representing nature, but even to go beyond nature\n                    itself
  and to develop a world of pure imagination. “In the\n                    fairyland
  of fancy,” he remarked in his Conjectures, “genius may wander wild; there it has\n
  \                   creative power, and may reign arbitrarily over its own empire
  of\n                    chimeras.” This is the essence of the ultra-modern spirit,
  and\n                    Young himself recog- nized that it was partly\n                    rant.
  But he declared unequiv- ocally,\n                    “all arts and sciences are
  making considerable\n                    advance,” and he did not hesitate to ask,
  “why may\n                    not poetry go forward with this advancement?”Condorcet,
  probably the most ardent “perfectibilian”\n                    of the century, vigorously
  supported the view that progress occurs in the\n                    fine arts. In
  his Historical Sketch (1793) he made\n                    an original distinction
  between “that which belongs really to\n                    the progress of art and
  that which is due only to the talent of the\n                    artist.” In the
  past, he contended, critics had judged artists\n                    rather than
  works, giving rise to the adulation of the ancient authors\n                    and
  the growth of a cult requiring imitation of the first models. Although\n                    not
  making any aesthetic comparisons between specific ancient and modern\n                        au-
  thors, Condorcet affirmed that the arts\n                    are improved by and
  draw profit from advances in philosophy and\n                    science—either
  through more precise knowledge of the effects and\n                    powers of
  these arts themselves or through the destruction of prejudices\n                    against
  them. Reasoning such as this may have inspired the poet Shelley\n                    to
  speculate in the Preface to The Revolt of Islam\n                    (1817), that
  “there may be such a thing as perfectibility\n                    in works of fiction.”This
  doctrine of perfectibility is related to the socio- logical criticism of La Motte
  since both systems\n                    assume that literature is as much a product
  of society as of\n                    individuals. The concept of the interaction
  of literature and society\n                    directly opposes all theories of
  absolute values, including that of the\n                    supremacy of the ancients.
  Mme de Staël fully developoed the\n                    concept in her pioneer treatise
  Literature Considered in\n                        Its Relations with Social Institutions
  (De la\n                        Littérature considerée dans ses rapports avec les\n
  \                       institutions sociales, 1800).In Spain, ever since Luis Vives
  in the sixteenth century had used literary\n                    arguments against
  the doc-In France the debate continued on scientific as well as aesthetic grounds.\n
  \                   Father Noël Regnault, in hisAncient Origin of New Physics (L'Origine
  ancienne de la physique nouvelle [1734]), stressed\n                    the great
  debt which modern science owes to the ancients and argued\n                    that
  the improvements of his day would not have been possible without the\n                    ancients.
  A French Protestant clergyman, living in England, Louis Dutens,\n                    published
  in 1766 An Inquiry into the Origin of the\n                        Discoveries attributed
  to the Moderns: Wherein It is Demonstrated,\n                        That our most
  celebrated Philosophers have, for most part, taken what\n                        they
  advance from the Works of the Ancients, and that many important\n                        Truths
  in Religion were known to the Pagan Sages. Considering the\n                    works
  of his predecessors, Perrault, Fontenelle, Wotton, and Temple as\n                    comprising
  fine declamation and rhetoric rather than proofs or\n                    demonstrations,
  Dutens at- tempted to reveal\n                    the enormous share the ancients
  have had in “modern\n                    discoveries.” He followed Addison and Dubos
  in distinguishing\n                    between those arts and sciences “which require
  long experience\n                    and practice to bring them to perfection, and
  those which depend solely\n                    on talent and genius.” He admitted
  that the moderns have\n                     brought the former to higher stages
  of development, and that\n                    the Christian religion has even extended
  mo-\n                    rality itself. Also in the area of scientific inventions,
  he\n                    distinguished between the products of genius and philosophy
  and the\n                    “mere effects of chance, or the lucky hits of some
  ignorant\n                    artisans.” After including printing, gunpowder, and
  the compass\n                    in the category of lucky hits he tried to trace
  to the ancients the\n                    systems of logic and metaphysics of Descartes,
  Leibniz, Malebranche, and\n                    Locke; Buffon's theories of universal
  matter, generation, and nutrition:\n                    Newton's theory of colors;
  Harvey's theory of the circulation of blood;\n                    the plurality
  of worlds; the motion of the earth around the sun; and\n                    the
  sexual system of plants. On the subjects of architecture, sculpture,\n                    poetry,
  eloquence, and his- tory, Dutens took\n                    for granted the preeminence
  of the ancients, affirming that “The\n                    moderns themselves will
  not contest with them; on the contrary the height\n                    of their
  ambition is, to imitate them.” Dutens concluded\n                    that the ancients
  had preceded or prepared the way for the moderns\n                    “in almost
  all truths of the greatest importance.”\n                    Supporting the theory
  of Temple that the ancients had their own ancients,\n                    as well
  as commenting on the opinion of Perrault that recent discoveries\n                    had
  been so extensive that there was little left to be learned, he\n                    quoted
  Seneca concerning the future: “Had even everything been\n                    found
  out by the ancients, there would still this remain to be done anew,\n                    to
  put their inven- tions into use and make their knowledge ours” (Epistle 64). Though
  Dutens' work is today virtually\n                    unknown, it was widely circulated
  in its own time. John Wesley, for\n                    example, republished it in
  abridged form in later editions of his Survey of the Wisdom of God in Crea-\n                            tion—a
  text-book of popular science originally\n                        pub- lished in
  1763—which went\n                    through several editions in England and the
  United States. Summarizing his\n                    own impression, Wesley exclaimed:
  “Alas! how little new has\n                    been discovered, even by Gassendi,
  Malebranche, Mr. Locke, or Sir Isaac\n                    Newton! How plain is it,
  that in philosophy, as well as the course of human\n                    affairs,
  'there is nothing new under the sun.'”A number of replies to this objection of the
  lack of novelty, which Wesley\n                    was quoting from Ecclesiastes
  in the Old Testament\n                    (1:9), were already in print. In order
  to discourage literary imitations,\n                    La Motte ridi- culed the
  concept that no new\n                    thoughts are possible and that the human
  mind had already imagined every- thing that could be said. He compared\n                    ideas
  to the variety in human physiognomies and affirmed that\n                    experience
  shows that no two men will ever be born who are exactly alike.\n                    In
  like manner, even though ideas may always follow certain common paths,\n                    there
  will always be infinite opportunity for original appli- cations (Discourse\n                        on
  Poetry [1707]). Marivaux in The086\n                         Mirror (1755) made
  exactly the same comparison and\n                    added as a further analogy
  that just as man has not discovered all the\n                    forms of which
  matter is susceptible, he has not exhausted all the ways of\n                    thinking
  and feeling.Dubos similarly argued that artists of genius do not use the works of
  their\n                    predecessors as models, but go directly to nature. “Nature
  is\n                    more abundant in differ- ent or varied\n                    subjects
  than the genius of artisans in ways of imitating them.”\n                    Dubos
  made the original observation, moreover, that particular subjects\n                    are
  compatible for the talents of particular artists, and that some\n                    subjects
  remain virtually untouched because no artist has yet discovered\n                    them.
  Thomas Paine charac-\n                    teristically scoffed in an essay in The\n
  \                       Pennsylvania Magazine (1775) that the notion that “We have
  found out everything has been the motto of\n                    every age,” and
  that this species of vanity was stronger among\n                    the ancients
  than the moderns. Combining chronological and cultural\n                    primitivism,
  he diverted himself by look- ing\n                    back and imagining “a circle
  of original Indians haranguing on\n                    the sublime perfection of
  the age.”Voltaire associated the quarrel of ancients and mod-\n                        erns
  with one of the most important scientific projects of the\n                    century,
  twin expeditions organized by the French Academy of Science to\n                    measure
  the latitude at the North Pole and at the Equator and thus to\n                    test
  Newton's hypothesis that the earth is flattened at the poles. In\n                    a
  congratulatory poem to the scientists (“A Messieurs de\n                    l'Académie
  des Sciences” [1738]), Voltaire\n                    unequivocally espoused the
  side of the moderns. Addressing the ancient\n                    Greeks, Voltaire
  bid them to be ashamed and embarrassed at their poor\n                    performance
  in contrast to the great exploits of his contemporaries.\n                    “Your
  century” he declared “is vanquished by\n                    the century in which
  we are.” According to Voltaire, opin- ion in the past had universally favored the\n
  \                   Greeks, only because it had been in bondage to lies and prejudices.
  In\n                    a note to his poem, Voltaire reaffirmed the parallel between
  science and\n                    literature, but his examples reveal his own prejudices.
  He declared that\n                    two minor French musical tragedies, Alcine
  and Armide, were worth more than all Greek poetry put\n                    together
  and that Thales and Pythagoras were not fit to study under\n                    Newton.
  “But the first-comers seized the Temple of Glory,\n                    time confirmed
  their claim, and the late-comers find the area\n                    occupied.” In
  one of his tales, “The World as It\n                    is” (1746) Voltaire insisted
  that the first efforts in\n                    every art are always crude despite
  the preference which critics\n                    stubbornly accord to the ancients
  over the mod-\n                    erns. In his seminal history The Century of Louis\n
  \                   XIV (1752), he unequivocally asserted “the prodigious su- periority
  of our century over the\n                    ancients” and added that at least as
  far as philosophy is\n                    concerned the\n                     dispute
  is definitely decided in favor of the moderns. In a\n                    later dialogue
  bearing the title Ancients and\n                    Moderns (1765), Voltaire retreated
  to the more moder- ate position of Fontenelle that the controversy\n                    could
  best be resolved by granting that the modern world had\n                    discovered
  new laws of physics, but had not improved upon the ancients'\n                    rules
  of eloquence.Oliver Goldsmith maintained that there exists no real basis of comparison\n
  \                   between ancients and moderns, calling in question, in his An
  Enquiry into the Present State of Polite Learning (1759), the\n                    commonplace
  that nature is always the same. According to Goldsmith,\n                    both
  ancients and moderns imitated nature as they found it, but nature was\n                    different
  for each culture. Both ancients and moderns should then be\n                    considered
  excel- lent in their separate\n                    imitations. Homer would have
  been despised by the Greeks if he had written\n                    like Milton,
  and Milton would have been ridiculous if he had adopted\n                    Homer's
  religion. One should not con- demn\n                    Plautus for failing to depict
  characters like Molière's, nor the\n                    reverse. To do so would
  be as absurd as condemning “a geographer\n                    for not introducing
  more rivers, or promontories, into a country, than\n                    nature had
  given it; or the natural historian, for not enlivening his\n                    description
  of a dead landscape with a torrent, cataract, or a\n                    volcano.”For
  Herder in Germany, it was not precisely nature which changes from one\n                    chronological
  period to an- other, but national\n                    cultures which differ one
  from another. Classical art he described, in an\n                    essay Homer
  und Ossian (1795), as an\n                    expression of national, cultural and
  social conditions which no longer\n                    exist in the modern world.
  Imitations of ancient art, therefore, are\n                    false and without
  soul since they do not express the emotions of the\n                    artist.
  According to Herder, a German poet of the eighteenth century cannot\n                    create
  ancient art just as an apple tree cannot bear pears.Herder argued moreover in his
  Philosophy of the History of\n                        the Development of Mankind
  (Philosophie der\n                        Geschichte zur Bildung der Menschheit
  [1774]) that just as\n                    there exists no “absolute” human being,
  but all\n                    members of the human race differ one from another,
  there can be no one\n                    historical form of culture—the ancient
  or any\n                    other—which can be made as an “abso- lute ideal.” The
  classic norm forced the poet\n                    to be an imitator, not a creator.
  Herder, like Goldsmith, was a\n                    moderate. He did not try to elevate
  either the ancient or the modern world\n                    over the other, but
  he agreed with virtually all of his predecessors on the\n                    side
  of the moderns that the artist should follow his own inspira- tion or native talent
  rather than the\n                    standards or models of the past.New impetus
  for studying and understanding the ancients came during the\n                    second
  half of the eighteenthThe best general treatment is that of J. B. Bury in The Idea
  of Progress (London 1920; New York, 1932). The\n                        Renaissance
  background is exhaustively presented by José\n                        Antonio Maravall

  French aspect is treated by H. Rigault in Histoire de la querelle des modernes (Paris,\n
