- "                Phantom Compass was founded back in 2008 as a service company developing
  branded games for kids TV producers. Our first four years were highly productive,
  but we couldn't grow the company on the basis of low-budget Flash games. \r\n"
- |
  In late 2011, a local triple-A studio laid off dozens of staff. Many of them had years of industry experience, but few or no shipped titles and needed to build their portfolios before finding work. Phantom Compass founder, Tony Walsh and production head, Ericka Evans, saw an opportunity in this and brought some of the best industry vets into a meeting with our tiny indie team.

- "                                                                                    \n"

- "                \n"
- "                \r\n"
- "The triple-A side came to us with high production values and experience with shipping
  large titles. On the indie side, we had rapid development know-how, agility, and
  experience running distributed teams (Phantom Compass operates out of Toronto and
  nearby St. Catharines). Our mission was to bring both sides together in creating
  a small game for Xbox Live Indie Games -- a six-month project where we could learn
  from each other, provide our triple-A friends with a unique portfolio piece, and
  shift Phantom Compass into high gear. \r\n"
- "We took a big risk in combining two distinct teams and fittingly chose an unlikely
  mash-up of pinball and role-playing games. What we ended up with three years, two
  funding rounds, and nearly 50 extended team members later exceeded everyone's expectations.
  Here are the high scores and gutter balls of that adventure.\r\n"
- "What Went Right:\r\n"
- "1. Being a Bit Weird\r\n"
- "The original idea for Rollers of the Realm came out of a group brainstorming meeting
  between Phantom Compass and our laid-off triple-A friends. We needed an idea that
  was easy to get behind and small enough in scope to produce over 3-6 months. Our
  friend, Tom Beirnes, brought up Pinball Quest as something that hadn't really been
  done in a while. Pinball Quest was an RPG pinball game for the NES in the early
  '90s. \"RPG + Pinball\" instantly excited us. \r\n"
- "The early XNA version of the game\r\n"
- "This offbeat high concept opened a lot of doors. We managed to pull together a
  2D XNA vertical slice prototype of the game in time for GDC 2012 and got ready to
  show our weird little game to the world. We set up meetings with potential publishers
  and barked \"RPG pinball\" to any passers by with a press badge. Almost all were
  immediately intrigued by the concept, yet couldn't wrap their heads around how it
  would work. This turned out to be a great recipe to start dialogue and get to know
  publishers, press, and other like-minded devs.\r\n"
- "Bolstered by the interest and encouragement from that first GDC showing, we decided
  to pursue production funding from two major Canadian funds, the CMF Experimental
  program and the OMDC Interactive Digital Media Fund. Both funders value innovation:
  being weird paid off, and we received production funding to turn our small 2D portfolio
  project into our first major 3D game.\r\n"
- "2. Quirky, Appealing Characters \r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "Once we caught people's attention with \"RPG pinball,\" our characters sustained
  interest. The game narrative was purposely kept simple and familiar to place focus
  on our odd array of misfit playable characters. Our pinball heroes were pulled from
  the margins: a young girl, an old drunk, an elderly woman, a mother, an Arab-esque
  fighter, an African-style mystic.    \r\n"
- "The playable characters were given a lot of attention in production and we think
  they came together nicely on all levels. The number one comment we received when
  demoing Rollers was \"I love the character art!\" The 2D art was supplied by a talented
  group of young contractors who were willing and able to take the time to develop
  interesting characters fitting the quirky nature of the game. \r\n"
- "We were equally lucky with our casting call for VO. Some very experienced voice
  actors were able to take on multiple parts and some naturally talented non-actors
  filled in the ethnic backgrounds we needed. This required extra time in casting
  and recording but it was worth it. We listened to over 200 voice submissions before
  finding Maya Wolosyn, who stars as our tough but lovable Rogue. Our game director
  was a film director in a past life, so he was able to get great performances out
  of everybody... except himself. He recast himself.\r\n"
- "3. Making Sure the Game was Fun\r\n"
- "Is it fun? Yes, it is. How do we know? We tested it. The core mechanics (namely
  pinball combat) proved to be universally fun to those attracted to the game. This
  was evident from our first prototypes all the way to the final product. Even some
  of our harshest critics don't deny that the core gameplay is fun.\r\n"
- "With an odd genre blend to prove out, we engaged in public playtesting earlier
  and more often than we had with other products. We hosted public \"Test Fests\"
  at our office, took the game to festivals, conferences, demo nights, trade shows
  and competitions. Consequently, we had hundreds of testers from ages 3 to 83 play
  the game throughout production.   \r\n"
- "We discovered that people were drawn to the game for different reasons which gave
  us some clues as to who our core audience was or wasn't -- some were attracted to
  art style or high concept, some were pinball fans, some were RPG fans, and some
  were both. \r\n"
- "The final game\r\n"
- "Once they were drawn in, they would often spend 20-30+ minutes with us and the
  game before moving on --  this gave us invaluable feedback that we able to incorporate
  into the game. Watching a stranger play your work in progress can point out your
  design mistakes pretty quickly. There were times where we thought a playfield design
  was worked out or the instructions were clear, and then we would demo it and watch
  20 strangers in a row struggle with same issues. This process was so useful that
  we will be keeping it up with all of our future projects. \r\n"
- "In hindsight, we did however get stuck with a public testing problem. As simple
  as it sounds, Rollers of the Realm has a bit of learning curve and 3/4 of Chapter
  1 is the tutorial. It also has a linear story that we didn't want to totally spoil
  for potential consumers, so we most often only demoed the first two chapters of
  the game.\r\n"
- "Full game playtesting was limited to our small group of Closed Beta Testers, our
  development team and only one of our hosted \"Test Fest\" events. Our small group
  of closed Beta testers played remotely from their homes and provided great written
  feedback, but we weren't able to benefit from the \"watching as you play\" experience
  that live demoing gave us. Consequently later chapters didn't benefit as much from
  playtesting as the first two chapters. In the future we will consider having our
  Closed Beta Testers to privately stream their testing sessions with us.\r\n"
- "4. Choosing Unity 3D for Development\r\n"
- "When we first started work on our portfolio prototype in the fall of 2011, Phantom
  Compass was just considering switching from being primarily a Flash shop to Unity
  3D shop. Although we were well versed in C#, we had only been experimenting with
  Unity and our triple-A friends had no experience with it at all.\r\n"
- "Our target platform for Rollers at the time was Xbox Live Community Games -- with
  the stretch goal of hitting Xbox Live Arcade if we could polish things up. Our timeline
  was only 3-6 months. Everyone involved was already familiar with XNA, which meant
  we could get up and running faster, so we moved forward with a 2D XNA plan. Our
  artists were primarily 3D artists, and planned to model the environments and characters
  in 3D and then paint them over to make our textures and sprites. \r\n"
- "In the fall of 2012, we got production funding from CMF and OMDC in Canada and
  part of our vision for a larger, more robust game was adding the third \"D\" to
  Rollers. We scrapped our 2D XNA prototype and started coding it from scratch in
  C# for Unity 3D. With a few months of actual development experience with Unity under
  our belts, our new goals were to focus on PC development, with an eye towards Steam
  and when (and if) the time came, we would take advantage of Unity's multi-platform
  publishing abilities to take the game further platforms. \r\n"
- "Unity 3D was easy to pick up, even for the designers and artists who had no experience
  with it, and we were able to rapidly re-prototype the game and go into full production
  quickly. We were able to reuse some of the 3D environment and character assets that
  we had created for the original prototype to give us a head start on asset creation.
  Our designers we were able to remap most of our 2D playfield designs in 3D space,
  playing with Unity's built-in physics engine. \r\n"
- "Unity's large, supportive, and active community definitely made development easier.
  Help on any question we had nearly always proved to be just a forum search away.
  The asset store saved us time/money more than once, with solutions that would have
  taken us days or weeks to produce on our own. An asset store rock looks just as
  nice and works just as well as a homemade rock, for example. We did however get
  burned more than once by paying for a solution instead of investing in a custom
  one. iTweens, for example, didn't play nice with the PS Vita. \r\n"
- "When Atlus approached us to bring the game to PS4 and PS Vita, Unity 3D's multi-platform
  publishing was a great selling point. This however was tempered in practice by a
  few points that might better fit in the \"what went wrong\" section. The closer
  we got to this cutting edge of Unity's tech, the harder it was to find the support
  we needed. There was great documentation and lively forums for PS Vita, but apparently
  there just aren't that many Unity devs who have developed games for PS4, so that
  lovely big community support network we were used to got a whole lot smaller. We
  suspect Rollers was the first Unity game to have cross-buy and cross-save for PS4
  and PS Vita (either that or the other devs were particularly quiet about it).\r\n"
- "5. Taking a Big Risk to make a Big Step Forward\r\n"
- "When we first conceived of the relationship between our teeny four-man indie studio
  and 20+ laid-off/between-jobs developers, we knew it would be challenging and risky
  on many levels. To get the prototype started we had more than quadruple the company
  size and onboard people who were used to a traditional office environment into our
  distributed office environment -- communicating primarily through Skype, Gmail,
  Google Docs, Dropbox, SVN and Assembla, our cloud-based code and task tracking software. \r\n"
- "We had to be very accommodating around hours of work and time commitments and be
  ready for it all to change, as people rolled off of the project when they found
  full-time work. We had to be agile and resourceful to keep the game moving forward
  even though the team behind it shifted constantly. \r\n"
- "Rollers of the Realm also tackled a risky design challenge -- taking on a relatively
  unproven, unusual genre-blend was a risk we took on because we just loved the idea
  so much. We were very fortunate that our creative director, Dave Evans, was a constant.
  He championed and drove the project from day one, which definitely took some pain
  out of those early days. \r\n"
- "So what came out of that risk? So much goodness. We have built great working relationships
  with experienced and talented developers. We've grown our company to a small but
  mighty 10 employees. We've been nominated and even won awards, got Greenlit on Steam,
  and negotiated our company's first international publishing deal. We've shipped
  our first console title. We now have super-fans who love our game (and we love them
  right back!) All huge steps for an unknown indie -- Rollers of the Realm has taken
  us further than we dreamed. \r\n"

- 'Phantom Compass was founded back in 2008 as a service company developing branded
  games for kids TV producers. Our first four years were highly productive, but we
  couldn''t grow the company on the basis of low-budget Flash games. In late 2011,
  a local triple-A studio laid off dozens of staff. Many of them had years of industry
  experience, but few or no shipped titles and needed to build their portfolios before
  finding work. Phantom Compass founder, Tony Walsh and production head, Ericka Evans,
  saw an opportunity in this and brought some of the best industry vets into a meeting
  with our tiny indie team.The triple-A side came to us with high production values
  and experience with shipping large titles. On the indie side, we had rapid development
  know-how, agility, and experience running distributed teams (Phantom Compass operates
  out of Toronto and nearby St. Catharines). Our mission was to bring both sides together
  in creating a small game for Xbox Live Indie Games -- a six-month project where
  we could learn from each other, provide our triple-A friends with a unique portfolio
  piece, and shift Phantom Compass into high gear. We took a big risk in combining
  two distinct teams and fittingly chose an unlikely mash-up of pinball and role-playing
  games. What we ended up with three years, two funding rounds, and nearly 50 extended
  team members later exceeded everyone''s expectations. Here are the high scores and
  gutter balls of that adventure.The original idea for Rollers of the Realm came out
  of a group brainstorming meeting between Phantom Compass and our laid-off triple-A
  friends. We needed an idea that was easy to get behind and small enough in scope
  to produce over 3-6 months. Our friend, Tom Beirnes, brought up Pinball Quest as
  something that hadn''t really been done in a while. Pinball Quest was an RPG pinball
  game for the NES in the early ''90s. "RPG + Pinball" instantly excited us. The early
  XNA version of the gameThis offbeat high concept opened a lot of doors. We managed
  to pull together a 2D XNA vertical slice prototype of the game in time for GDC 2012
  and got ready to show our weird little game to the world. We set up meetings with
  potential publishers and barked "RPG pinball" to any passers by with a press badge.
  Almost all were immediately intrigued by the concept, yet couldn''t wrap their heads
  around how it would work. This turned out to be a great recipe to start dialogue
  and get to know publishers, press, and other like-minded devs.Bolstered by the interest
  and encouragement from that first GDC showing, we decided to pursue production funding
  from two major Canadian funds, the CMF Experimental program and the OMDC Interactive
  Digital Media Fund. Both funders value innovation: being weird paid off, and we
  received production funding to turn our small 2D portfolio project into our first
  major 3D game.Once we caught people''s attention with "RPG pinball," our characters
  sustained interest. The game narrative was purposely kept simple and familiar to
  place focus on our odd array of misfit playable characters. Our pinball heroes were
  pulled from the margins: a young girl, an old drunk, an elderly woman, a mother,
  an Arab-esque fighter, an African-style mystic.    The playable characters were
  given a lot of attention in production and we think they came together nicely on
  all levels. The number one comment we received when demoing Rollers was "I love
  the character art!" The 2D art was supplied by a talented group of young contractors
  who were willing and able to take the time to develop interesting characters fitting
  the quirky nature of the game. We were equally lucky with our casting call for VO.
  Some very experienced voice actors were able to take on multiple parts and some
  naturally talented non-actors filled in the ethnic backgrounds we needed. This required
  extra time in casting and recording but it was worth it. We listened to over 200
  voice submissions before finding Maya Wolosyn, who stars as our tough but lovable
  Rogue. Our game director was a film director in a past life, so he was able to get
  great performances out of everybody... except himself. He recast himself.Is it fun?
  Yes, it is. How do we know? We tested it. The core mechanics (namely pinball combat)
  proved to be universally fun to those attracted to the game. This was evident from
  our first prototypes all the way to the final product. Even some of our harshest
  critics don''t deny that the core gameplay is fun.With an odd genre blend to prove
  out, we engaged in public playtesting earlier and more often than we had with other
  products. We hosted public "Test Fests" at our office, took the game to festivals,
  conferences, demo nights, trade shows and competitions. Consequently, we had hundreds
  of testers from ages 3 to 83 play the game throughout production.   We discovered
  that people were drawn to the game for different reasons which gave us some clues
  as to who our core audience was or wasn''t -- some were attracted to art style or
  high concept, some were pinball fans, some were RPG fans, and some were both. The
  final gameOnce they were drawn in, they would often spend 20-30+ minutes with us
  and the game before moving on --  this gave us invaluable feedback that we able
  to incorporate into the game. Watching a stranger play your work in progress can
  point out your design mistakes pretty quickly. There were times where we thought
  a playfield design was worked out or the instructions were clear, and then we would
  demo it and watch 20 strangers in a row struggle with same issues. This process
  was so useful that we will be keeping it up with all of our future projects. In
  hindsight, we did however get stuck with a public testing problem. As simple as
  it sounds, Rollers of the Realm has a bit of learning curve and 3/4 of Chapter 1
  is the tutorial. It also has a linear story that we didn''t want to totally spoil
  for potential consumers, so we most often only demoed the first two chapters of
  the game.Full game playtesting was limited to our small group of Closed Beta Testers,
  our development team and only one of our hosted "Test Fest" events. Our small group
  of closed Beta testers played remotely from their homes and provided great written
  feedback, but we weren''t able to benefit from the "watching as you play" experience
  that live demoing gave us. Consequently later chapters didn''t benefit as much from
  playtesting as the first two chapters. In the future we will consider having our
  Closed Beta Testers to privately stream their testing sessions with us.When we first
  started work on our portfolio prototype in the fall of 2011, Phantom Compass was
  just considering switching from being primarily a Flash shop to Unity 3D shop. Although
  we were well versed in C#, we had only been experimenting with Unity and our triple-A
  friends had no experience with it at all.Our target platform for Rollers at the
  time was Xbox Live Community Games -- with the stretch goal of hitting Xbox Live
  Arcade if we could polish things up. Our timeline was only 3-6 months. Everyone
  involved was already familiar with XNA, which meant we could get up and running
  faster, so we moved forward with a 2D XNA plan. Our artists were primarily 3D artists,
  and planned to model the environments and characters in 3D and then paint them over
  to make our textures and sprites. In the fall of 2012, we got production funding
  from CMF and OMDC in Canada and part of our vision for a larger, more robust game
  was adding the third "D" to Rollers. We scrapped our 2D XNA prototype and started
  coding it from scratch in C# for Unity 3D. With a few months of actual development
  experience with Unity under our belts, our new goals were to focus on PC development,
  with an eye towards Steam and when (and if) the time came, we would take advantage
  of Unity''s multi-platform publishing abilities to take the game further platforms. Unity
  3D was easy to pick up, even for the designers and artists who had no experience
  with it, and we were able to rapidly re-prototype the game and go into full production
  quickly. We were able to reuse some of the 3D environment and character assets that
  we had created for the original prototype to give us a head start on asset creation.
  Our designers we were able to remap most of our 2D playfield designs in 3D space,
  playing with Unity''s built-in physics engine. Unity''s large, supportive, and active
  community definitely made development easier. Help on any question we had nearly
  always proved to be just a forum search away. The asset store saved us time/money
  more than once, with solutions that would have taken us days or weeks to produce
  on our own. An asset store rock looks just as nice and works just as well as a homemade
  rock, for example. We did however get burned more than once by paying for a solution
  instead of investing in a custom one. iTweens, for example, didn''t play nice with
  the PS Vita. When Atlus approached us to bring the game to PS4 and PS Vita, Unity
  3D''s multi-platform publishing was a great selling point. This however was tempered
  in practice by a few points that might better fit in the "what went wrong" section.
  The closer we got to this cutting edge of Unity''s tech, the harder it was to find
  the support we needed. There was great documentation and lively forums for PS Vita,
  but apparently there just aren''t that many Unity devs who have developed games
  for PS4, so that lovely big community support network we were used to got a whole
  lot smaller. We suspect Rollers was the first Unity game to have cross-buy and cross-save
  for PS4 and PS Vita (either that or the other devs were particularly quiet about
  it).When we first conceived of the relationship between our teeny four-man indie
  studio and 20+ laid-off/between-jobs developers, we knew it would be challenging
  and risky on many levels. To get the prototype started we had more than quadruple
  the company size and onboard people who were used to a traditional office environment
  into our distributed office environment -- communicating primarily through Skype,
  Gmail, Google Docs, Dropbox, SVN and Assembla, our cloud-based code and task tracking
  software. We had to be very accommodating around hours of work and time commitments
  and be ready for it all to change, as people rolled off of the project when they
  found full-time work. We had to be agile and resourceful to keep the game moving
  forward even though the team behind it shifted constantly. Rollers of the Realm
  also tackled a risky design challenge -- taking on a relatively unproven, unusual
  genre-blend was a risk we took on because we just loved the idea so much. We were
  very fortunate that our creative director, Dave Evans, was a constant. He championed
  and drove the project from day one, which definitely took some pain out of those
  early days. So what came out of that risk? So much goodness. We have built great
  working relationships with experienced and talented developers. We''ve grown our
  company to a small but mighty 10 employees. We''ve been nominated and even won awards,
  got Greenlit on Steam, and negotiated our company''s first international publishing
  deal. We''ve shipped our first console title. We now have super-fans who love our
  game (and we love them right back!) All huge steps for an unknown indie -- Rollers
  of the Realm has taken us further than we dreamed. '

  Compass was founded back in 2008 as a service company developing branded games for
  kids TV producers. Our first four years were highly productive, but we couldn't
  grow the company on the basis of low-budget Flash games. \r\nIn late 2011, a local
  triple-A studio laid off dozens of staff. Many of them had years of industry experience,
  but few or no shipped titles and needed to build their portfolios before finding
  work. Phantom Compass founder, Tony Walsh and production head, Ericka Evans, saw
  an opportunity in this and brought some of the best industry vets into a meeting
  with our tiny indie team.\n                \n                    \n                                                                                    \n\n
  \n  googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-rec1');\n \n\n                                                                        \n
  \               \n                \r\nThe triple-A side came to us with high production
  values and experience with shipping large titles. On the indie side, we had rapid
  development know-how, agility, and experience running distributed teams (Phantom
  Compass operates out of Toronto and nearby St. Catharines). Our mission was to bring
  both sides together in creating a small game for Xbox Live Indie Games -- a six-month
  project where we could learn from each other, provide our triple-A friends with
  a unique portfolio piece, and shift Phantom Compass into high gear. \r\nWe took
  a big risk in combining two distinct teams and fittingly chose an unlikely mash-up
  of pinball and role-playing games. What we ended up with three years, two funding
  rounds, and nearly 50 extended team members later exceeded everyone's expectations.
  Here are the high scores and gutter balls of that adventure.\r\nWhat Went Right:\r\n1.
  Being a Bit Weird\r\nThe original idea for Rollers of the Realm came out of a group
  brainstorming meeting between Phantom Compass and our laid-off triple-A friends.
  We needed an idea that was easy to get behind and small enough in scope to produce
  over 3-6 months. Our friend, Tom Beirnes, brought up Pinball Quest as something
  that hadn't really been done in a while. Pinball Quest was an RPG pinball game for
  the NES in the early '90s. \"RPG + Pinball\" instantly excited us. \r\nThe early
  XNA version of the game\r\nThis offbeat high concept opened a lot of doors. We managed
  to pull together a 2D XNA vertical slice prototype of the game in time for GDC 2012
  and got ready to show our weird little game to the world. We set up meetings with
  potential publishers and barked \"RPG pinball\" to any passers by with a press badge.
  Almost all were immediately intrigued by the concept, yet couldn't wrap their heads
  around how it would work. This turned out to be a great recipe to start dialogue
  and get to know publishers, press, and other like-minded devs.\r\nBolstered by the
  interest and encouragement from that first GDC showing, we decided to pursue production
  funding from two major Canadian funds, the CMF Experimental program and the OMDC
  Interactive Digital Media Fund. Both funders value innovation: being weird paid
  off, and we received production funding to turn our small 2D portfolio project into
  our first major 3D game.\r\n2. Quirky, Appealing Characters \r\n\r\nOnce we caught
  people's attention with \"RPG pinball,\" our characters sustained interest. The
  game narrative was purposely kept simple and familiar to place focus on our odd
  array of misfit playable characters. Our pinball heroes were pulled from the margins:
  a young girl, an old drunk, an elderly woman, a mother, an Arab-esque fighter, an
  African-style mystic.    \r\nThe playable characters were given a lot of attention
  in production and we think they came together nicely on all levels. The number one
  comment we received when demoing Rollers was \"I love the character art!\" The 2D
  art was supplied by a talented group of young contractors who were willing and able
  to take the time to develop interesting characters fitting the quirky nature of
  the game. \r\nWe were equally lucky with our casting call for VO. Some very experienced
  voice actors were able to take on multiple parts and some naturally talented non-actors
  filled in the ethnic backgrounds we needed. This required extra time in casting
  and recording but it was worth it. We listened to over 200 voice submissions before
  finding Maya Wolosyn, who stars as our tough but lovable Rogue. Our game director
  was a film director in a past life, so he was able to get great performances out
  of everybody... except himself. He recast himself.\r\n3. Making Sure the Game was
  Fun\r\nIs it fun? Yes, it is. How do we know? We tested it. The core mechanics (namely
  pinball combat) proved to be universally fun to those attracted to the game. This
  was evident from our first prototypes all the way to the final product. Even some
  of our harshest critics don't deny that the core gameplay is fun.\r\nWith an odd
  genre blend to prove out, we engaged in public playtesting earlier and more often
  than we had with other products. We hosted public \"Test Fests\" at our office,
  took the game to festivals, conferences, demo nights, trade shows and competitions.
  Consequently, we had hundreds of testers from ages 3 to 83 play the game throughout
  production.   \r\nWe discovered that people were drawn to the game for different
  reasons which gave us some clues as to who our core audience was or wasn't -- some
  were attracted to art style or high concept, some were pinball fans, some were RPG
  fans, and some were both. \r\nThe final game\r\nOnce they were drawn in, they would
  often spend 20-30+ minutes with us and the game before moving on --  this gave us
  invaluable feedback that we able to incorporate into the game. Watching a stranger
  play your work in progress can point out your design mistakes pretty quickly. There
  were times where we thought a playfield design was worked out or the instructions
  were clear, and then we would demo it and watch 20 strangers in a row struggle with
  same issues. This process was so useful that we will be keeping it up with all of
  our future projects. \r\nIn hindsight, we did however get stuck with a public testing
  problem. As simple as it sounds, Rollers of the Realm has a bit of learning curve
  and 3/4 of Chapter 1 is the tutorial. It also has a linear story that we didn't
  want to totally spoil for potential consumers, so we most often only demoed the
  first two chapters of the game.\r\nFull game playtesting was limited to our small
  group of Closed Beta Testers, our development team and only one of our hosted \"Test
  Fest\" events. Our small group of closed Beta testers played remotely from their
  homes and provided great written feedback, but we weren't able to benefit from the
  \"watching as you play\" experience that live demoing gave us. Consequently later
  chapters didn't benefit as much from playtesting as the first two chapters. In the
  future we will consider having our Closed Beta Testers to privately stream their
  testing sessions with us.\r\n4. Choosing Unity 3D for Development\r\nWhen we first
  started work on our portfolio prototype in the fall of 2011, Phantom Compass was
  just considering switching from being primarily a Flash shop to Unity 3D shop. Although
  we were well versed in C#, we had only been experimenting with Unity and our triple-A
  friends had no experience with it at all.\r\nOur target platform for Rollers at
  the time was Xbox Live Community Games -- with the stretch goal of hitting Xbox
  Live Arcade if we could polish things up. Our timeline was only 3-6 months. Everyone
  involved was already familiar with XNA, which meant we could get up and running
  faster, so we moved forward with a 2D XNA plan. Our artists were primarily 3D artists,
  and planned to model the environments and characters in 3D and then paint them over
  to make our textures and sprites. \r\nIn the fall of 2012, we got production funding
  from CMF and OMDC in Canada and part of our vision for a larger, more robust game
  was adding the third \"D\" to Rollers. We scrapped our 2D XNA prototype and started
  coding it from scratch in C# for Unity 3D. With a few months of actual development
  experience with Unity under our belts, our new goals were to focus on PC development,
  with an eye towards Steam and when (and if) the time came, we would take advantage
  of Unity's multi-platform publishing abilities to take the game further platforms. \r\nUnity
  3D was easy to pick up, even for the designers and artists who had no experience
  with it, and we were able to rapidly re-prototype the game and go into full production
  quickly. We were able to reuse some of the 3D environment and character assets that
  we had created for the original prototype to give us a head start on asset creation.
  Our designers we were able to remap most of our 2D playfield designs in 3D space,
  playing with Unity's built-in physics engine. \r\nUnity's large, supportive, and
  active community definitely made development easier. Help on any question we had
  nearly always proved to be just a forum search away. The asset store saved us time/money
  more than once, with solutions that would have taken us days or weeks to produce
  on our own. An asset store rock looks just as nice and works just as well as a homemade
  rock, for example. We did however get burned more than once by paying for a solution
  instead of investing in a custom one. iTweens, for example, didn't play nice with
  the PS Vita. \r\nWhen Atlus approached us to bring the game to PS4 and PS Vita,
  Unity 3D's multi-platform publishing was a great selling point. This however was
  tempered in practice by a few points that might better fit in the \"what went wrong\"
  section. The closer we got to this cutting edge of Unity's tech, the harder it was
  to find the support we needed. There was great documentation and lively forums for
  PS Vita, but apparently there just aren't that many Unity devs who have developed
  games for PS4, so that lovely big community support network we were used to got
  a whole lot smaller. We suspect Rollers was the first Unity game to have cross-buy
  and cross-save for PS4 and PS Vita (either that or the other devs were particularly
  quiet about it).\r\n5. Taking a Big Risk to make a Big Step Forward\r\nWhen we first
  conceived of the relationship between our teeny four-man indie studio and 20+ laid-off/between-jobs
  developers, we knew it would be challenging and risky on many levels. To get the
  prototype started we had more than quadruple the company size and onboard people
  who were used to a traditional office environment into our distributed office environment
  -- communicating primarily through Skype, Gmail, Google Docs, Dropbox, SVN and Assembla,
  our cloud-based code and task tracking software. \r\nWe had to be very accommodating
  around hours of work and time commitments and be ready for it all to change, as
  people rolled off of the project when they found full-time work. We had to be agile
  and resourceful to keep the game moving forward even though the team behind it shifted
  constantly. \r\nRollers of the Realm also tackled a risky design challenge -- taking
  on a relatively unproven, unusual genre-blend was a risk we took on because we just
  loved the idea so much. We were very fortunate that our creative director, Dave
  Evans, was a constant. He championed and drove the project from day one, which definitely
  took some pain out of those early days. \r\nSo what came out of that risk? So much
  goodness. We have built great working relationships with experienced and talented
  developers. We've grown our company to a small but mighty 10 employees. We've been
  nominated and even won awards, got Greenlit on Steam, and negotiated our company's
  first international publishing deal. We've shipped our first console title. We now
  have super-fans who love our game (and we love them right back!) All huge steps
  for an unknown indie -- Rollers of the Realm has taken us further than we dreamed. \r\n\n

  Compass was founded back in 2008 as a service company developing branded games for
  kids TV producers. Our first four years were highly productive, but we couldn't
  grow the company on the basis of low-budget Flash games. In late 2011, a local triple-A
  studio laid off dozens of staff. Many of them had years of industry experience,
  but few or no shipped titles and needed to build their portfolios before finding
  work. Phantom Compass founder, Tony Walsh and production head, Ericka Evans, saw
  an opportunity in this and brought some of the best industry vets into a meeting
  with our tiny indie team.The triple-A side came to us with high production values
  and experience with shipping large titles. On the indie side, we had rapid development
  know-how, agility, and experience running distributed teams (Phantom Compass operates
  out of Toronto and nearby St. Catharines). Our mission was to bring both sides together
  in creating a small game for Xbox Live Indie Games -- a six-month project where
  we could learn from each other, provide our triple-A friends with a unique portfolio
  piece, and shift Phantom Compass into high gear. We took a big risk in combining
  two distinct teams and fittingly chose an unlikely mash-up of pinball and role-playing
  games. What we ended up with three years, two funding rounds, and nearly 50 extended
  team members later exceeded everyone's expectations. Here are the high scores and
  gutter balls of that adventure.The original idea for Rollers of the Realm came out
  of a group brainstorming meeting between Phantom Compass and our laid-off triple-A
  friends. We needed an idea that was easy to get behind and small enough in scope
  to produce over 3-6 months. Our friend, Tom Beirnes, brought up Pinball Quest as
  something that hadn't really been done in a while. Pinball Quest was an RPG pinball
  game for the NES in the early '90s. \"RPG + Pinball\" instantly excited us. The
  early XNA version of the gameThis offbeat high concept opened a lot of doors. We
  managed to pull together a 2D XNA vertical slice prototype of the game in time for
  GDC 2012 and got ready to show our weird little game to the world. We set up meetings
  with potential publishers and barked \"RPG pinball\" to any passers by with a press
  badge. Almost all were immediately intrigued by the concept, yet couldn't wrap their
  heads around how it would work. This turned out to be a great recipe to start dialogue
  and get to know publishers, press, and other like-minded devs.Bolstered by the interest
  and encouragement from that first GDC showing, we decided to pursue production funding
  from two major Canadian funds, the CMF Experimental program and the OMDC Interactive
  Digital Media Fund. Both funders value innovation: being weird paid off, and we
  received production funding to turn our small 2D portfolio project into our first
  major 3D game.Once we caught people's attention with \"RPG pinball,\" our characters
  sustained interest. The game narrative was purposely kept simple and familiar to
  place focus on our odd array of misfit playable characters. Our pinball heroes were
  pulled from the margins: a young girl, an old drunk, an elderly woman, a mother,
  an Arab-esque fighter, an African-style mystic.    The playable characters were
  given a lot of attention in production and we think they came together nicely on
  all levels. The number one comment we received when demoing Rollers was \"I love
  the character art!\" The 2D art was supplied by a talented group of young contractors
  who were willing and able to take the time to develop interesting characters fitting
  the quirky nature of the game. We were equally lucky with our casting call for VO.
  Some very experienced voice actors were able to take on multiple parts and some
  naturally talented non-actors filled in the ethnic backgrounds we needed. This required
  extra time in casting and recording but it was worth it. We listened to over 200
  voice submissions before finding Maya Wolosyn, who stars as our tough but lovable
  Rogue. Our game director was a film director in a past life, so he was able to get
  great performances out of everybody... except himself. He recast himself.Is it fun?
  Yes, it is. How do we know? We tested it. The core mechanics (namely pinball combat)
  proved to be universally fun to those attracted to the game. This was evident from
  our first prototypes all the way to the final product. Even some of our harshest
  critics don't deny that the core gameplay is fun.With an odd genre blend to prove
  out, we engaged in public playtesting earlier and more often than we had with other
  products. We hosted public \"Test Fests\" at our office, took the game to festivals,
  conferences, demo nights, trade shows and competitions. Consequently, we had hundreds
  of testers from ages 3 to 83 play the game throughout production.   We discovered
  that people were drawn to the game for different reasons which gave us some clues
  as to who our core audience was or wasn't -- some were attracted to art style or
  high concept, some were pinball fans, some were RPG fans, and some were both. The
  final gameOnce they were drawn in, they would often spend 20-30+ minutes with us
  and the game before moving on --  this gave us invaluable feedback that we able
  to incorporate into the game. Watching a stranger play your work in progress can
  point out your design mistakes pretty quickly. There were times where we thought
  a playfield design was worked out or the instructions were clear, and then we would
  demo it and watch 20 strangers in a row struggle with same issues. This process
  was so useful that we will be keeping it up with all of our future projects. In
  hindsight, we did however get stuck with a public testing problem. As simple as
  it sounds, Rollers of the Realm has a bit of learning curve and 3/4 of Chapter 1
  is the tutorial. It also has a linear story that we didn't want to totally spoil
  for potential consumers, so we most often only demoed the first two chapters of
  the game.Full game playtesting was limited to our small group of Closed Beta Testers,
  our development team and only one of our hosted \"Test Fest\" events. Our small
  group of closed Beta testers played remotely from their homes and provided great
  written feedback, but we weren't able to benefit from the \"watching as you play\"
  experience that live demoing gave us. Consequently later chapters didn't benefit
  as much from playtesting as the first two chapters. In the future we will consider
  having our Closed Beta Testers to privately stream their testing sessions with us.When
  we first started work on our portfolio prototype in the fall of 2011, Phantom Compass
  was just considering switching from being primarily a Flash shop to Unity 3D shop.
  Although we were well versed in C#, we had only been experimenting with Unity and
  our triple-A friends had no experience with it at all.Our target platform for Rollers
  at the time was Xbox Live Community Games -- with the stretch goal of hitting Xbox
  Live Arcade if we could polish things up. Our timeline was only 3-6 months. Everyone
  involved was already familiar with XNA, which meant we could get up and running
  faster, so we moved forward with a 2D XNA plan. Our artists were primarily 3D artists,
  and planned to model the environments and characters in 3D and then paint them over
  to make our textures and sprites. In the fall of 2012, we got production funding
  from CMF and OMDC in Canada and part of our vision for a larger, more robust game
  was adding the third \"D\" to Rollers. We scrapped our 2D XNA prototype and started
  coding it from scratch in C# for Unity 3D. With a few months of actual development
  experience with Unity under our belts, our new goals were to focus on PC development,
  with an eye towards Steam and when (and if) the time came, we would take advantage
  of Unity's multi-platform publishing abilities to take the game further platforms. Unity
  3D was easy to pick up, even for the designers and artists who had no experience
  with it, and we were able to rapidly re-prototype the game and go into full production
  quickly. We were able to reuse some of the 3D environment and character assets that
  we had created for the original prototype to give us a head start on asset creation.
  Our designers we were able to remap most of our 2D playfield designs in 3D space,
  playing with Unity's built-in physics engine. Unity's large, supportive, and active
  community definitely made development easier. Help on any question we had nearly
  always proved to be just a forum search away. The asset store saved us time/money
  more than once, with solutions that would have taken us days or weeks to produce
  on our own. An asset store rock looks just as nice and works just as well as a homemade
  rock, for example. We did however get burned more than once by paying for a solution
  instead of investing in a custom one. iTweens, for example, didn't play nice with
  the PS Vita. When Atlus approached us to bring the game to PS4 and PS Vita, Unity
  3D's multi-platform publishing was a great selling point. This however was tempered
  in practice by a few points that might better fit in the \"what went wrong\" section.
  The closer we got to this cutting edge of Unity's tech, the harder it was to find
  the support we needed. There was great documentation and lively forums for PS Vita,
  but apparently there just aren't that many Unity devs who have developed games for
  PS4, so that lovely big community support network we were used to got a whole lot
  smaller. We suspect Rollers was the first Unity game to have cross-buy and cross-save
  for PS4 and PS Vita (either that or the other devs were particularly quiet about
  it).When we first conceived of the relationship between our teeny four-man indie
  studio and 20+ laid-off/between-jobs developers, we knew it would be challenging
  and risky on many levels. To get the prototype started we had more than quadruple
  the company size and onboard people who were used to a traditional office environment
  into our distributed office environment -- communicating primarily through Skype,
  Gmail, Google Docs, Dropbox, SVN and Assembla, our cloud-based code and task tracking
  software. We had to be very accommodating around hours of work and time commitments
  and be ready for it all to change, as people rolled off of the project when they
  found full-time work. We had to be agile and resourceful to keep the game moving
  forward even though the team behind it shifted constantly. Rollers of the Realm
  also tackled a risky design challenge -- taking on a relatively unproven, unusual
  genre-blend was a risk we took on because we just loved the idea so much. We were
  very fortunate that our creative director, Dave Evans, was a constant. He championed
  and drove the project from day one, which definitely took some pain out of those
  early days. So what came out of that risk? So much goodness. We have built great
  working relationships with experienced and talented developers. We've grown our
  company to a small but mighty 10 employees. We've been nominated and even won awards,
  got Greenlit on Steam, and negotiated our company's first international publishing
  deal. We've shipped our first console title. We now have super-fans who love our
  game (and we love them right back!) All huge steps for an unknown indie -- Rollers
  of the Realm has taken us further than we dreamed. "
