- "\t\t  \tSAN ANTONIO –  On the heels of reassurances by Texas officials to residents
  that the federal government will provide the funds and support for the hundreds
  of unaccompanied minors from Central America who are being sheltered there, Sylvia
  Burwell, the secretary of Health and Human Services, is warning Congress that her
  agency faces a budget shortfall and could be overwhelmed by the new influx of children.\n"
- |2+

- |
  In a letter obtain by the Associated Press, Burwell told members of the U.S. House of Representatives' Appropriations Committee that even with increased contingency funding requested by the president, the agency still faces a shortage that could lead to "the situation we faced in (2014) when children were left at the border for unacceptable periods of time."
- |2+

- |
  Agency spokesman Mark Weber said the secretary is communicating with members of Congress to take all the necessary steps to "make sure that we're prepared," and that the letter doesn't demand funds beyond the president's budget request.
- |2+

- |
  Last week, Local officials in Texas said they were prepared to receive hundreds of Central American children who are described by U.S. federal authorities as having fled violence in their home countries.

  At a press conference Thursday, Ellis County officials said some 500 undocumented children were be transported to a camp area in the next few days. They were expected to be at the Lakeview Camp and Retreat Center for the next three weeks as plans are developed on where they will go from there, according to the Dallas Morning News.
- |2+

- |
  Rick DuBose, superintendent of the Assemblies of God, said that some 50 percent of the unaccompanied children will be returned to their countries. Others are expected to be resettled with relatives here, DuBose said.
- |2+

- |
  DuBose said Lakeview’s agreement with a non-profit organization was to house 500 children and more than 200 support staffers. The children are mainly between 12 and 17 years old, according to published reports.
- |2+

- |
  “We didn’t feel like there was any way we could turn them away and not care for them and feed them when we have the beds that are empty and food that can be served and a process here,” DuBose said, according to KeraNews.org. “It’s our slowest time of year.  So we were very available. We’ve jumped on it. We’re honored to give these kids a place to live for the next three weeks.”
- |2+

- |
  Ellis County Sheriff Johnny Brown said there would be enough police security to keep the facility safe for everyone. Every two children would have one adult worker assigned to them, Brown said.
- |2+

- |
  “I want to make sure the citizens of Ellis County know that this is under control and we have everything secure and they have no fears at this point. We do have a plan in place for any kind of emergencies,” Brown said, according to KeraNews.org. “This will become a miniature city for the next 21 days. They have fire control, EMS, everything under control.”

  A total of 10,588 unaccompanied children crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in October and November, more than double the 5,129 who crossed during the same two months last year, according to the U.S. Border Patrol. The number of family members crossing together has nearly tripled, to 12,505.
- |2+

- |
  The administration is hoping to avoid a repeat of the crisis it saw in the summer of 2014, when tens of thousands of children and families poured over the southwest border. Border Patrol holding areas became overcrowded, with children sleeping on concrete floors covered by aluminum foil-like blankets. The surge in children arriving without parents overwhelmed the U.S. government and the White House labelled it "a humanitarian crisis."

  A total of 10,588 unaccompanied children crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in October and November, compared with 5,129 who crossed during the same two months last year, according to the U.S. Border Patrol. The uptick has already prompted the agency to open two shelters in Texas and one in California.
- |2+

- |
  Burwell says in her letter that "it's impossible to know whether these trends will continue."
- |2+

- |
  Border crossings have not reached the levels of summer last year, when more than 10,000 children arrived in the United States that June alone.
- |2+

- |
  By law, unaccompanied child migrants from countries that don't border the United States must be handed over to the Department of Health and Human Services within 72 hours of being detained. The government is responsible for caring for the children until they are united with a relative or sponsor in the U.S. and immigration courts can rule on their cases.
- |2+

- |
  Not only has the number of unaccompanied minors doubled, but the number of family members crossing together has nearly tripled from the same time last year, to 12,505 during the past two months. Adult male immigrants are usually sent to detention centers, and families, the majority women with children, are usually sent to detention centers, though detention times have become shorter since a federal judge's ruling that children can only be detained in these facilities for a matter of weeks at most.
- |2+

- |
  Experts say increasing gang violence in Central America is pushing people to flee. The tiny country of El Salvador has seen its homicide rate skyrocket to levels not seen since the country's civil war, and violence continues to plague Honduras and Guatemala. The increase in migration is worrisome, they say, because it comes at a time of year when the cold usually keeps people away.
- |2+

- |
  Though Mexico has cracked down on migrants within its borders and returned a large number to their home countries, experts say smugglers are finding new ways around checkpoints and have established new networks of bribes that allow them to get migrants to the U.S. border.

  You're logged in as  Judy Martinez tries to reach family after being released by ICE at a Greyhound Bus station in Phoenix, May 28, 2014.apSAN ANTONIO –  On the heels of reassurances by Texas officials to residents that the federal government will provide the funds and support for the hundreds of unaccompanied minors from Central America who are being sheltered there, Sylvia Burwell, the secretary of Health and Human Services, is warning Congress that her agency faces a budget shortfall and could be overwhelmed by the new influx of children.In a letter obtain by the Associated Press, Burwell told members of the U.S. House of Representatives' Appropriations Committee that even with increased contingency funding requested by the president, the agency still faces a shortage that could lead to "the situation we faced in (2014) when children were left at the border for unacceptable periods of time."Agency spokesman Mark Weber said the secretary is communicating with members of Congress to take all the necessary steps to "make sure that we're prepared," and that the letter doesn't demand funds beyond the president's budget request.Last week, Local officials in Texas said they were prepared to receive hundreds of Central American children who are described by U.S. federal authorities as having fled violence in their home countries.At a press conference Thursday, Ellis County officials said some 500 undocumented children were be transported to a camp area in the next few days. They were expected to be at the Lakeview Camp and Retreat Center for the next three weeks as plans are developed on where they will go from there, according to the Dallas Morning News.Rick DuBose, superintendent of the Assemblies of God, said that some 50 percent of the unaccompanied children will be returned to their countries. Others are expected to be resettled with relatives here, DuBose said.DuBose said Lakeview’s agreement with a non-profit organization was to house 500 children and more than 200 support staffers. The children are mainly between 12 and 17 years old, according to published reports.“We didn’t feel like there was any way we could turn them away and not care for them and feed them when we have the beds that are empty and food that can be served and a process here,” DuBose said, according to KeraNews.org. “It’s our slowest time of year.  So we were very available. We’ve jumped on it. We’re honored to give these kids a place to live for the next three weeks.”Ellis County Sheriff Johnny Brown said there would be enough police security to keep the facility safe for everyone. Every two children would have one adult worker assigned to them, Brown said.“I want to make sure the citizens of Ellis County know that this is under control and we have everything secure and they have no fears at this point. We do have a plan in place for any kind of emergencies,” Brown said, according to KeraNews.org. “This will become a miniature city for the next 21 days. They have fire control, EMS, everything under control.”A total of 10,588 unaccompanied children crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in October and November, more than double the 5,129 who crossed during the same two months last year, according to the U.S. Border Patrol. The number of family members crossing together has nearly tripled, to 12,505.The administration is hoping to avoid a repeat of the crisis it saw in the summer of 2014, when tens of thousands of children and families poured over the southwest border. Border Patrol holding areas became overcrowded, with children sleeping on concrete floors covered by aluminum foil-like blankets. The surge in children arriving without parents overwhelmed the U.S. government and the White House labelled it "a humanitarian crisis."A total of 10,588 unaccompanied children crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in October and November, compared with 5,129 who crossed during the same two months last year, according to the U.S. Border Patrol. The uptick has already prompted the agency to open two shelters in Texas and one in California.Burwell says in her letter that "it's impossible to know whether these trends will continue."Border crossings have not reached the levels of summer last year, when more than 10,000 children arrived in the United States that June alone.By law, unaccompanied child migrants from countries that don't border the United States must be handed over to the Department of Health and Human Services within 72 hours of being detained. The government is responsible for caring for the children until they are united with a relative or sponsor in the U.S. and immigration courts can rule on their cases.Not only has the number of unaccompanied minors doubled, but the number of family members crossing together has nearly tripled from the same time last year, to 12,505 during the past two months. Adult male immigrants are usually sent to detention centers, and families, the majority women with children, are usually sent to detention centers, though detention times have become shorter since a federal judge's ruling that children can only be detained in these facilities for a matter of weeks at most.Experts say increasing gang violence in Central America is pushing people to flee. The tiny country of El Salvador has seen its homicide rate skyrocket to levels not seen since the country's civil war, and violence continues to plague Honduras and Guatemala. The increase in migration is worrisome, they say, because it comes at a time of year when the cold usually keeps people away.Though Mexico has cracked down on migrants within its borders and returned a large number to their home countries, experts say smugglers are finding new ways around checkpoints and have established new networks of bribes that allow them to get migrants to the U.S. border.The AP contributed to this report.Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram

  \ \tSAN ANTONIO –  On the heels of reassurances by Texas officials to residents
  that the federal government will provide the funds and support for the hundreds
  of unaccompanied minors from Central America who are being sheltered there, Sylvia
  Burwell, the secretary of Health and Human Services, is warning Congress that her
  agency faces a budget shortfall and could be overwhelmed by the new influx of children.\n\nIn
  a letter obtain by the Associated Press, Burwell told members of the U.S. House
  of Representatives' Appropriations Committee that even with increased contingency
  funding requested by the president, the agency still faces a shortage that could
  lead to \"the situation we faced in (2014) when children were left at the border
  for unacceptable periods of time.\"\n\nAgency spokesman Mark Weber said the secretary
  is communicating with members of Congress to take all the necessary steps to \"make
  sure that we're prepared,\" and that the letter doesn't demand funds beyond the
  president's budget request.\n\nLast week, Local officials in Texas said they were
  prepared to receive hundreds of Central American children who are described by U.S.
  federal authorities as having fled violence in their home countries.\n\nAt a press
  conference Thursday, Ellis County officials said some 500 undocumented children
  were be transported to a camp area in the next few days. They were expected to be
  at the Lakeview Camp and Retreat Center for the next three weeks as plans are developed
  on where they will go from there, according to the Dallas Morning News.\n\nRick
  DuBose, superintendent of the Assemblies of God, said that some 50 percent of the
  unaccompanied children will be returned to their countries. Others are expected
  to be resettled with relatives here, DuBose said.\n\nDuBose said Lakeview’s agreement
  with a non-profit organization was to house 500 children and more than 200 support
  staffers. The children are mainly between 12 and 17 years old, according to published
  reports.\n\n“We didn’t feel like there was any way we could turn them away and not
  care for them and feed them when we have the beds that are empty and food that can
  be served and a process here,” DuBose said, according to KeraNews.org. “It’s our
  slowest time of year.  So we were very available. We’ve jumped on it. We’re honored
  to give these kids a place to live for the next three weeks.”\n\nEllis County Sheriff
  Johnny Brown said there would be enough police security to keep the facility safe
  for everyone. Every two children would have one adult worker assigned to them, Brown
  said.\n\n“I want to make sure the citizens of Ellis County know that this is under
  control and we have everything secure and they have no fears at this point. We do
  have a plan in place for any kind of emergencies,” Brown said, according to KeraNews.org.
  “This will become a miniature city for the next 21 days. They have fire control,
  EMS, everything under control.”\n\nA total of 10,588 unaccompanied children crossed
  the U.S.-Mexico border in October and November, more than double the 5,129 who crossed
  during the same two months last year, according to the U.S. Border Patrol. The number
  of family members crossing together has nearly tripled, to 12,505.\n\nThe administration
  is hoping to avoid a repeat of the crisis it saw in the summer of 2014, when tens
  of thousands of children and families poured over the southwest border. Border Patrol
  holding areas became overcrowded, with children sleeping on concrete floors covered
  by aluminum foil-like blankets. The surge in children arriving without parents overwhelmed
  the U.S. government and the White House labelled it \"a humanitarian crisis.\"\n\nA
  total of 10,588 unaccompanied children crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in October
  and November, compared with 5,129 who crossed during the same two months last year,
  according to the U.S. Border Patrol. The uptick has already prompted the agency
  to open two shelters in Texas and one in California.\n\nBurwell says in her letter
  that \"it's impossible to know whether these trends will continue.\"\n\nBorder crossings
  have not reached the levels of summer last year, when more than 10,000 children
  arrived in the United States that June alone.\n\nBy law, unaccompanied child migrants
  from countries that don't border the United States must be handed over to the Department
  of Health and Human Services within 72 hours of being detained. The government is
  responsible for caring for the children until they are united with a relative or
  sponsor in the U.S. and immigration courts can rule on their cases.\n\nNot only
  has the number of unaccompanied minors doubled, but the number of family members
  crossing together has nearly tripled from the same time last year, to 12,505 during
  the past two months. Adult male immigrants are usually sent to detention centers,
  and families, the majority women with children, are usually sent to detention centers,
  though detention times have become shorter since a federal judge's ruling that children
  can only be detained in these facilities for a matter of weeks at most.\n\nExperts
  say increasing gang violence in Central America is pushing people to flee. The tiny
  country of El Salvador has seen its homicide rate skyrocket to levels not seen since
  the country's civil war, and violence continues to plague Honduras and Guatemala.
  The increase in migration is worrisome, they say, because it comes at a time of
  year when the cold usually keeps people away.\n\nThough Mexico has cracked down
  on migrants within its borders and returned a large number to their home countries,
  experts say smugglers are finding new ways around checkpoints and have established
  new networks of bribes that allow them to get migrants to the U.S. border.\n\nThe
  AP contributed to this report.\n\nLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & Instagram\n\t\t

  Martinez tries to reach family after being released by ICE at a Greyhound Bus station
  in Phoenix, May 28, 2014.apSAN ANTONIO –  On the heels of reassurances by Texas
  officials to residents that the federal government will provide the funds and support
  for the hundreds of unaccompanied minors from Central America who are being sheltered
  there, Sylvia Burwell, the secretary of Health and Human Services, is warning Congress
  that her agency faces a budget shortfall and could be overwhelmed by the new influx
  of children.In a letter obtain by the Associated Press, Burwell told members of
  the U.S. House of Representatives' Appropriations Committee that even with increased
  contingency funding requested by the president, the agency still faces a shortage
  that could lead to \"the situation we faced in (2014) when children were left at
  the border for unacceptable periods of time.\"Agency spokesman Mark Weber said the
  secretary is communicating with members of Congress to take all the necessary steps
  to \"make sure that we're prepared,\" and that the letter doesn't demand funds beyond
  the president's budget request.Last week, Local officials in Texas said they were
  prepared to receive hundreds of Central American children who are described by U.S.
  federal authorities as having fled violence in their home countries.At a press conference
  Thursday, Ellis County officials said some 500 undocumented children were be transported
  to a camp area in the next few days. They were expected to be at the Lakeview Camp
  and Retreat Center for the next three weeks as plans are developed on where they
  will go from there, according to the Dallas Morning News.Rick DuBose, superintendent
  of the Assemblies of God, said that some 50 percent of the unaccompanied children
  will be returned to their countries. Others are expected to be resettled with relatives
  here, DuBose said.DuBose said Lakeview’s agreement with a non-profit organization
  was to house 500 children and more than 200 support staffers. The children are mainly
  between 12 and 17 years old, according to published reports.“We didn’t feel like
  there was any way we could turn them away and not care for them and feed them when
  we have the beds that are empty and food that can be served and a process here,”
  DuBose said, according to KeraNews.org. “It’s our slowest time of year.  So we were
  very available. We’ve jumped on it. We’re honored to give these kids a place to
  live for the next three weeks.”Ellis County Sheriff Johnny Brown said there would
  be enough police security to keep the facility safe for everyone. Every two children
  would have one adult worker assigned to them, Brown said.“I want to make sure the
  citizens of Ellis County know that this is under control and we have everything
  secure and they have no fears at this point. We do have a plan in place for any
  kind of emergencies,” Brown said, according to KeraNews.org. “This will become a
  miniature city for the next 21 days. They have fire control, EMS, everything under
  control.”A total of 10,588 unaccompanied children crossed the U.S.-Mexico border
  in October and November, more than double the 5,129 who crossed during the same
  two months last year, according to the U.S. Border Patrol. The number of family
  members crossing together has nearly tripled, to 12,505.The administration is hoping
  to avoid a repeat of the crisis it saw in the summer of 2014, when tens of thousands
  of children and families poured over the southwest border. Border Patrol holding
  areas became overcrowded, with children sleeping on concrete floors covered by aluminum
  foil-like blankets. The surge in children arriving without parents overwhelmed the
  U.S. government and the White House labelled it \"a humanitarian crisis.\"A total
  of 10,588 unaccompanied children crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in October and November,
  compared with 5,129 who crossed during the same two months last year, according
  to the U.S. Border Patrol. The uptick has already prompted the agency to open two
  shelters in Texas and one in California.Burwell says in her letter that \"it's impossible
  to know whether these trends will continue.\"Border crossings have not reached the
  levels of summer last year, when more than 10,000 children arrived in the United
  States that June alone.By law, unaccompanied child migrants from countries that
  don't border the United States must be handed over to the Department of Health and
  Human Services within 72 hours of being detained. The government is responsible
  for caring for the children until they are united with a relative or sponsor in
  the U.S. and immigration courts can rule on their cases.Not only has the number
  of unaccompanied minors doubled, but the number of family members crossing together
  has nearly tripled from the same time last year, to 12,505 during the past two months.
  Adult male immigrants are usually sent to detention centers, and families, the majority
  women with children, are usually sent to detention centers, though detention times
  have become shorter since a federal judge's ruling that children can only be detained
  in these facilities for a matter of weeks at most.Experts say increasing gang violence
  in Central America is pushing people to flee. The tiny country of El Salvador has
  seen its homicide rate skyrocket to levels not seen since the country's civil war,
  and violence continues to plague Honduras and Guatemala. The increase in migration
  is worrisome, they say, because it comes at a time of year when the cold usually
  keeps people away.Though Mexico has cracked down on migrants within its borders
  and returned a large number to their home countries, experts say smugglers are finding
  new ways around checkpoints and have established new networks of bribes that allow
  them to get migrants to the U.S. border.The AP contributed to this report.Like us
