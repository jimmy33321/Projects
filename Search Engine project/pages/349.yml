                  United States, officially United States of America, abbreviations U.S. or U.S.A., byname America, 
- "    country of North America, a federal republic of 50 states. Besides the 48 contiguous
  states that occupy the middle latitudes of the continent, the United States includes
  the state of Alaska, at the northwestern extreme of North America, and the island
  state of Hawaii, in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The coterminous states are bounded on
  the north by Canada, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the Gulf
  of Mexico and Mexico, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. The United States is
  the fourth largest country in the world in area (after Russia, Canada, and China).
  The national capital is Washington, which is coextensive with the District of Columbia,
  the federal capital region created in 1790.The major characteristic of the United
  States is probably its great variety. Its physical environment ranges from the Arctic
  to the subtropical, from the moist rain forest to the arid desert, from the rugged
  mountain peak to the flat prairie. Although the total population of the United States
  is large by world standards, its overall population density is relatively low; the
  country embraces some of the world’s largest urban concentrations as well as some
  of the most extensive areas that are almost devoid of habitation.The United States
  contains a highly diverse population. Unlike a country such as China that largely
  incorporated indigenous peoples, the United States has a diversity that to a great
  degree has come from an immense and sustained global immigration. Probably no other
  country has a wider range of racial, ethnic, and cultural types than does the United
  States. In addition to the presence of surviving Native Americans (including American
  Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos) and the descendants of Africans taken as slaves to
  the New World, the national character has been enriched, tested, and constantly
  redefined by the tens of millions of immigrants who by and large have come to America
  hoping for greater social, political, and economic opportunities than they had in
  the places they left. (It should be noted that although the terms “America” and
  “Americans” are often used as synonyms for the United States and its citizens, respectively,
  they are also used in a broader sense for North, South, and Central America collectively
  and their citizens.)The United States is the world’s greatest economic power, measured
  in terms of gross national product (GNP). The nation’s wealth is partly a reflection
  of its rich natural resources and its enormous agricultural output, but it owes
  more to the country’s highly developed industry. Despite its relative economic self-sufficiency
  in many areas, the United States is the most important single factor in world trade
  by virtue of the sheer size of its economy. Its exports and imports represent major
  proportions of the world total. The United States also impinges on the global economy
  as a source of and as a destination for investment capital. The country continues
  to sustain an economic life that is more diversified than any other on Earth, providing
  the majority of its people with one of the world’s highest standards of living.The
  United States is relatively young by world standards, being barely more than 200
  years old; it achieved its current size only in the mid-20th century. America was
  the first of the European colonies to separate successfully from its motherland,
  and it was the first nation to be established on the premise that sovereignty rests
  with its citizens and not with the government. In its first century and a half,
  the country was mainly preoccupied with its own territorial expansion and economic
  growth and with social debates that ultimately led to civil war and a healing period
  that is still not complete. In the 20th century the United States emerged as a world
  power, and since World War II it has been one of the preeminent powers. It has not
  accepted this mantle easily nor always carried it willingly; the principles and
  ideals of its founders have been tested by the pressures and exigencies of its dominant
  status. Although the United States still offers its residents opportunities for
  unparalleled personal advancement and wealth, the depletion of its resources, contamination
  of its environment, and continuing social and economic inequality that perpetuates
  areas of poverty and blight all threaten the fabric of the country.Ed.The District
  of Columbia is discussed in the article Washington. For discussion of other major
  U.S. cities, see the articles Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York
  City, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. Political units in association with the United
  States include Puerto Rico, discussed in the article Puerto Rico, and several Pacific
  islands, discussed in Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa.The landThe
  two great sets of elements that mold the physical environment of the United States
  are, first, the geologic, which determines the main patterns of landforms, drainage,
  and mineral resources and influences soils to a lesser degree, and, second, the
  atmospheric, which dictates not only climate and weather but also in large part
  the distribution of soils, plants, and animals. Although these elements are not
  entirely independent of one another, each produces on a map patterns that are so
  profoundly different that essentially they remain two separate geographies. (Since
  this article covers only the coterminous United States, see also the articles Alaska
  and Hawaii.)ReliefThe centre of the coterminous United States is a great sprawling
  interior lowland, reaching from the ancient shield of central Canada on the north
  to the Gulf of Mexico on the south. To east and west this lowland rises, first gradually
  and then abruptly, to mountain ranges that divide it from the sea on both sides.
  The two mountain systems differ drastically. The Appalachian Mountains on the east
  are low, almost unbroken, and in the main set well back from the Atlantic. From
  New York to the Mexican border stretches the low Coastal Plain, which faces the
  ocean along a swampy, convoluted coast. The gently sloping surface of the plain
  extends out beneath the sea, where it forms the continental shelf, which, although
  submerged beneath shallow ocean water, is geologically identical to the Coastal
  Plain. Southward the plain grows wider, swinging westward in Georgia and Alabama
  to truncate the Appalachians along their southern extremity and separate the interior
  lowland from the Gulf.West of the Central Lowland is the mighty Cordillera, part
  of a global mountain system that rings the Pacific Basin. The Cordillera encompasses
  fully one-third of the United States, with an internal variety commensurate with
  its size. At its eastern margin lie the Rocky Mountains, a high, diverse, and discontinuous
  chain that stretches all the way from New Mexico to the Canadian border. The Cordillera’s
  western edge is a Pacific coastal chain of rugged mountains and inland valleys,
  the whole rising spectacularly from the sea without benefit of a coastal plain.
  Pent between the Rockies and the Pacific chain is a vast intermontane complex of
  basins, plateaus, and isolated ranges so large and remarkable that they merit recognition
  as a region separate from the Cordillera itself.These regions—the Interior Lowlands
  and their upland fringes, the Appalachian Mountain system, the Atlantic Plain, the
  Western Cordillera, and the Western Intermontane Region—are so various that they
  require further division into 24 major subregions, or provinces (see map).The Interior
  Lowlands and their upland fringesMidwest States: GeographyEncyclopædia Britannica,
  Inc.Andrew Jackson is supposed to have remarked that the United States begins at
  the Alleghenies, implying that only west of the mountains, in the isolation and
  freedom of the great Interior Lowlands, could people finally escape Old World influences.
  Whether or not the lowlands constitute the country’s cultural core is debatable,
  but there can be no doubt that they comprise its geologic core and in many ways
  its geographic core as well.This enormous region rests upon an ancient, much-eroded
  platform of complex crystalline rocks that have for the most part lain undisturbed
  by major orogenic (mountain-building) activity for more than 600,000,000 years.
  Over much of central Canada, these Precambrian rocks are exposed at the surface
  and form the continent’s single largest topographical region, the formidable and
  ice-scoured Canadian Shield.In the United States most of the crystalline platform
  is concealed under a deep blanket of sedimentary rocks. In the far north, however,
  the naked Canadian Shield extends into the United States far enough to form two
  small but distinctive landform regions: the rugged and occasionally spectacular
  Adirondack Mountains of northern New York; and the more subdued but austere Superior
  Uplands of northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. As in the rest of the shield,
  glaciers have stripped soils away, strewn the surface with boulders and other debris,
  and obliterated preglacial drainage systems. Most attempts at farming in these areas
  have been abandoned, but the combination of a comparative wilderness in a northern
  climate, clear lakes, and white-water streams has fostered the development of both
  regions as year-round outdoor recreation areas.Mineral wealth in the Superior Uplands
  is legendary. Iron lies near the surface and close to the deepwater ports of the
  upper Great Lakes. Iron is mined both north and south of Lake Superior, but best
  known are the colossal deposits of Minnesota’s Mesabi Range, for more than a century
  one of the world’s richest and a vital element in America’s rise to industrial power.
  In spite of depletion, the Minnesota and Michigan mines still yield a major proportion
  of the country’s iron and a significant percentage of the world’s supply.South of
  the Adirondack Mountains and Superior Uplands lies the boundary between crystalline
  and sedimentary rocks; abruptly, everything is different. The core of this sedimentary
  region—the heartland of the United States—is the great Central Lowland, which stretches
  for 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometres) from New York to central Texas and north another
  1,000 miles to the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. To some, the landscape may
  seem dull, for heights of more than 2,000 feet (600 metres) are unusual, and truly
  rough terrain is almost lacking. Landscapes are varied, however, largely as the
  result of glaciation that directly or indirectly affected most of the subregion.
  North of the Missouri–Ohio river line, the advance and readvance of continental
  ice left an intricate mosaic of boulders, sand, gravel, silt, and clay and a complex
  pattern of lakes and drainage channels, some abandoned, some still in use. The southern
  part of the Central Lowland is quite different, covered mostly with loess (wind-deposited
  silt) that further subdued the already low relief surface. Elsewhere, especially
  near major rivers, postglacial streams carved the loess into rounded hills, and
  visitors have aptly compared their billowing shapes to the waves of the sea. Above
  all, the loess produces soil of extraordinary fertility. As the Mesabi iron was
  a major source of America’s industrial wealth, its agricultural prosperity has been
  rooted in Midwestern loess.The Central Lowland resembles a vast saucer, rising gradually
  to higher lands on all sides. Southward and eastward, the land rises gradually to
  three major plateaus. Beyond the reach of glaciation to the south, the sedimentary
  rocks have been raised into two broad upwarps, separated from one another by the
  great valley of the Mississippi River. The Ozark Plateau lies west of the river
  and occupies most of southern Missouri and northern Arkansas; on the east the Interior
  Low Plateaus dominate central Kentucky and Tennessee. Except for two nearly circular
  patches of rich limestone country—the Nashville Basin of Tennessee and the Kentucky
  Bluegrass region—most of both plateau regions consists of sandstone uplands, intricately
  dissected by streams. Local relief runs to several hundreds of feet in most places,
  and visitors to the region must travel winding roads along narrow stream valleys.
  The soils there are poor, and mineral resources are scanty.Eastward from the Central
  Lowland the Appalachian Plateau—a narrow band of dissected uplands that strongly
  resembles the Ozark Plateau and Interior Low Plateaus in steep slopes, wretched
  soils, and endemic poverty—forms a transition between the interior plains and the
  Appalachian Mountains. Usually, however, the Appalachian Plateau is considered a
  subregion of the Appalachian Mountains, partly on grounds of location, partly because
  of geologic structure. Unlike the other plateaus, where rocks are warped upward,
  the rocks there form an elongated basin, wherein bituminous coal has been preserved
  from erosion. This Appalachian coal, like the Mesabi iron that it complements in
  U.S. industry, is extraordinary. Extensive, thick, and close to the surface, it
  has stoked the furnaces of northeastern steel mills for decades and helps explain
  the huge concentration of heavy industry along the lower Great Lakes.The western
  flanks of the Interior Lowlands are the Great Plains, a territory of awesome bulk
  that spans the full distance between Canada and Mexico in a swath nearly 500 miles
  wide. The Great Plains were built by successive layers of poorly cemented sand,
  silt, and gravel—debris laid down by parallel east-flowing streams from the Rocky
  Mountains. Seen from the east, the surface of the Great Plains rises inexorably
  from about 2,000 feet near Omaha, Neb., to more than 6,000 feet at Cheyenne, Wyo.,
  but the climb is so gradual that popular legend holds the Great Plains to be flat.
  True flatness is rare, although the High Plains of western Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas,
  and eastern Colorado come close. More commonly, the land is broadly rolling, and
  parts of the northern plains are sharply dissected into badlands.The main mineral
  wealth of the Interior Lowlands derives from fossil fuels. Coal occurs in structural
  basins protected from erosion—high-quality bituminous in the Appalachian, Illinois,
  and western Kentucky basins; and subbituminous and lignite in the eastern and northwestern
  Great Plains. Petroleum and natural gas have been found in nearly every state between
  the Appalachians and the Rockies, but the Midcontinent Fields of western Texas and
  the Texas Panhandle, Oklahoma, and Kansas surpass all others. Aside from small deposits
  of lead and zinc, metallic minerals are of little importance.The Appalachian Mountain
  systemScrew Auger Falls© George WuerthnerThe Appalachians dominate the eastern United
  States and separate the Eastern Seaboard from the interior with a belt of subdued
  uplands that extends nearly 1,500 miles from northeastern Alabama to the Canadian
  border. They are old, complex mountains, the eroded stumps of much greater ranges.
  Present topography results from erosion that has carved weak rocks away, leaving
  a skeleton of resistant rocks behind as highlands. Geologic differences are thus
  faithfully reflected in topography. In the Appalachians these differences are sharply
  demarcated and neatly arranged, so that all the major subdivisions except New England
  lie in strips parallel to the Atlantic and to one another.The core of the Appalachians
  is a belt of complex metamorphic and igneous rocks that stretches all the way from
  Alabama to New Hampshire. The western side of this belt forms the long slender rampart
  of the Blue Ridge Mountains, containing the highest elevations in the Appalachians
  (Mount Mitchell, N.C., 6,684 feet [2,037 metres]) and some of its most handsome
  mountain scenery. On its eastern, or seaward, side the Blue Ridge descends in an
  abrupt and sometimes spectacular escarpment to the Piedmont, a well-drained, rolling
  land—never quite hills, but never quite a plain. Before the settlement of the Midwest
  the Piedmont was the most productive agricultural region in the United States, and
  several Pennsylvania counties still consistently report some of the highest farm
  yields per acre in the entire country.West of the crystalline zone, away from the
  axis of primary geologic deformation, sedimentary rocks have escaped metamorphism
  but are compressed into tight folds. Erosion has carved the upturned edges of these
  folded rocks into the remarkable Ridge and Valley country of the western Appalachians.
  Long linear ridges characteristically stand about 1,000 feet from base to crest
  and run for tens of miles, paralleled by broad open valleys of comparable length.
  In Pennsylvania, ridges run unbroken for great distances, occasionally turning abruptly
  in a zigzag pattern; by contrast, the southern ridges are broken by faults and form
  short, parallel segments that are lined up like magnetized iron filings. By far
  the largest valley—and one of the most important routes in North America—is the
  Great Valley, an extraordinary trench of shale and limestone that runs nearly the
  entire length of the Appalachians. It provides a lowland passage from the middle
  Hudson valley to Harrisburg, Pa., and on southward, where it forms the Shenandoah
  and Cumberland valleys, and has been one of the main paths through the Appalachians
  since pioneer times. In New England it is floored with slates and marbles and forms
  the Valley of Vermont, one of the few fertile areas in an otherwise mountainous
  region.Topography much like that of the Ridge and Valley is found in the Ouachita
  Mountains of western Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma, an area generally thought to
  be a detached continuation of Appalachian geologic structure, the intervening section
  buried beneath the sediments of the lower Mississippi valley.The once-glaciated
  New England section of the Appalachians is divided from the rest of the chain by
  an indentation of the Atlantic. Although almost completely underlain by crystalline
  rocks, New England is laid out in north–south bands, reminiscent of the southern
  Appalachians. The rolling, rocky hills of southeastern New England are not dissimilar
  to the Piedmont, while, farther northwest, the rugged and lofty White Mountains
  are a New England analogue to the Blue Ridge. (Mount Washington, N.H., at 6,288
  feet [1917 metres], is the highest peak in the northeastern United States.) The
  westernmost ranges—the Taconics, Berkshires, and Green Mountains—show a strong north–south
  lineation like the Ridge and Valley. Unlike the rest of the Appalachians, however,
  glaciation has scoured the crystalline rocks much like those of the Canadian Shield,
  so that New England is best known for its picturesque landscape, not for its fertile
  soil.Typical of diverse geologic regions, the Appalachians contain a great variety
  of minerals. Only a few occur in quantities large enough for sustained exploitation,
  notably iron in Pennsylvania’s Blue Ridge and Piedmont and the famous granites,
  marbles, and slates of northern New England. In Pennsylvania the Ridge and Valley
  region contains one of the world’s largest deposits of anthracite coal, once the
  basis of a thriving mining economy; many of the mines are now shut, oil and gas
  having replaced coal as the major fuel used to heat homes.The Atlantic PlainNortheast
  USA: Physical LandscapeEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The eastern and southeastern
  fringes of the United States are part of the outermost margins of the continental
  platform, repeatedly invaded by the sea and veneered with layer after layer of young,
  poorly consolidated sediments. Part of this platform now lies slightly above sea
  level and forms a nearly flat and often swampy coastal plain, which stretches from
  Cape Cod, Mass., to beyond the Mexican border. Most of the platform, however, is
  still submerged, so that a band of shallow water, the continental shelf, parallels
  the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, in some places reaching 250 miles out to sea.The Atlantic
  Plain slopes so gently that even slight crustal upwarping can shift the coastline
  far out to sea at the expense of the continental shelf. The peninsula of Florida
  is just such an upwarp; nowhere in its 400-mile length does the land rise more than
  350 feet above sea level; much of the southern and coastal areas rise less than
  10 feet and are poorly drained and dangerously exposed to Atlantic storms. Downwarps
  can result in extensive flooding. North of New York City, for example, the weight
  of glacial ice depressed most of the Coastal Plain beneath the sea, and the Atlantic
  now beats directly against New England’s rock-ribbed coasts. Cape Cod, Long Island
  (N.Y.), and a few offshore islands are all that remain of New England’s drowned
  Coastal Plain. Another downwarp lies perpendicular to the Gulf coast and guides
  the course of the lower Mississippi. The river, however, has filled with alluvium
  what otherwise would be an arm of the Gulf, forming a great inland salient of the
  Coastal Plain called the Mississippi Embayment.The Southeast: GeographyEncyclopædia
  Britannica, Inc.South of New York the Coastal Plain gradually widens, but ocean
  water has invaded the lower valleys of most of the coastal rivers and has turned
  them into estuaries. The greatest of these is Chesapeake Bay, merely the flooded
  lower valley of the Susquehanna River and its tributaries, but there are hundreds
  of others. Offshore a line of sandbars and barrier beaches stretches intermittently
  the length of the Coastal Plain, hampering entry of shipping into the estuaries
  but providing the eastern United States with a playground that is more than 1,000
  miles long.Poor soils are the rule on the Coastal Plain, though rare exceptions
  have formed some of America’s most famous agricultural regions—for example, the
  citrus country of central Florida’s limestone uplands and the Cotton Belt of the
  Old South, once centred on the alluvial plain of the Mississippi and belts of chalky
  black soils of eastern Texas, Alabama, and Mississippi. The Atlantic Plain’s greatest
  natural wealth derives from petroleum and natural gas trapped in domal structures
  that dot the Gulf Coast of eastern Texas and Louisiana. Onshore and offshore drilling
  have revealed colossal reserves of oil and natural gas.The Western CordilleraMountain
  Region: GeographyEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.West of the Great Plains the United
  States seems to become a craggy land whose skyline is rarely without mountains—totally
  different from the open plains and rounded hills of the East. On a map the alignment
  of the two main chains—the Rocky Mountains on the east, the Pacific ranges on the
  west—tempts one to assume a geologic and hence topographic homogeneity. Nothing
  could be farther from the truth, for each chain is divided into widely disparate
  sections.The Rockies are typically diverse. The Southern Rockies are composed of
  a disconnected series of lofty elongated upwarps, their cores made of granitic basement
  rocks, stripped of sediments, and heavily glaciated at high elevations. In New Mexico
  and along the western flanks of the Colorado ranges, widespread volcanism and deformation
  of colourful sedimentary rocks have produced rugged and picturesque country, but
  the characteristic central Colorado or southern Wyoming range is impressively austere
  rather than spectacular. The Front Range west of Denver is prototypical, rising
  abruptly from its base at about 6,000 feet to rolling alpine meadows between 11,000
  and 12,000 feet. Peaks appear as low hills perched on this high-level surface, so
  that Colorado, for example, boasts 53 mountains over 14,000 feet but not one over
  14,500 feet.The Middle Rockies cover most of west central Wyoming. Most of the ranges
  resemble the granitic upwarps of Colorado, but thrust faulting and volcanism have
  produced varied and spectacular country to the west, some of which is included in
  Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks. Much of the subregion, however, is not
  mountainous at all but consists of extensive intermontane basins and plains—largely
  floored with enormous volumes of sedimentary waste eroded from the mountains themselves.
  Whole ranges have been buried, producing the greatest gap in the Cordilleran system,
  the Wyoming Basin—resembling in geologic structure and topography an intermontane
  peninsula of the Great Plains. As a result, the Rockies have never posed an important
  barrier to east–west transportation in the United States; all major routes, from
  the Oregon Trail to interstate highways, funnel through the basin, essentially circumventing
  the main ranges of the Rockies.The Northern Rockies contain the most varied mountain
  landscapes of the Cordillera, reflecting a corresponding geologic complexity. The
  region’s backbone is a mighty series of batholiths—huge masses of molten rock that
  slowly cooled below the surface and were later uplifted. The batholiths are eroded
  into rugged granitic ranges, which, in central Idaho, compose the most extensive
  wilderness country in the coterminous United States. East of the batholiths and
  opposite the Great Plains, sediments have been folded and thrust-faulted into a
  series of linear north–south ranges, a southern extension of the spectacular Canadian
  Rockies. Although elevations run 2,000 to 3,000 feet lower than the Colorado Rockies
  (most of the Idaho Rockies lie well below 10,000 feet), increased rainfall and northern
  latitude have encouraged glaciation—there as elsewhere a sculptor of handsome alpine
  landscape.The Pacific Region: OverviewEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The western branch
  of the Cordillera directly abuts the Pacific Ocean. This coastal chain, like its
  Rocky Mountain cousins on the eastern flank of the Cordillera, conceals bewildering
  complexity behind a facade of apparent simplicity. At first glance the chain consists
  merely of two lines of mountains with a discontinuous trough between them. Immediately
  behind the coast is a line of hills and low mountains—the Pacific Coast Ranges.
  Farther inland, averaging 150 miles from the coast, the line of the Sierra Nevada
  and the Cascade Range includes the highest elevations in the coterminous United
  States. Between these two unequal mountain lines is a discontinuous trench, the
  Troughs of the Coastal Margin.Kings Canyon National ParkJosef MuenchThe apparent
  simplicity disappears under the most cursory examination. The Pacific Coast Ranges
  actually contain five distinct sections, each of different geologic origin and each
  with its own distinctive topography. The Transverse Ranges of southern California
  are a crowded assemblage of islandlike faulted ranges, with peak elevations of more
  than 10,000 feet but sufficiently separated by plains and low passes so that travel
  through them is easy. From Point Conception to the Oregon border, however, the main
  California Coast Ranges are entirely different, resembling the Appalachian Ridge
  and Valley region, with low linear ranges that result from erosion of faulted and
  folded rocks. Major faults run parallel to the low ridges, and the greatest—the
  notorious San Andreas Fault—was responsible for the earthquake that all but destroyed
  San Francisco in 1906. Along the California–Oregon border, everything changes again.
  In this region, the wildly rugged Klamath Mountains represent a western salient
  of interior structure reminiscent of the Idaho Rockies and the northern Sierra Nevada.
  In western Oregon and southwestern Washington the Coast Ranges are also different—a
  gentle, hilly land carved by streams from a broad arch of marine deposits interbedded
  with tabular lavas. In the northernmost part of the Coast Ranges and the remote
  northwest, a domal upwarp has produced the Olympic Mountains; its serrated peaks
  tower nearly 8,000 feet above Puget Sound and the Pacific, and the heavy precipitation
  on its upper slopes supports the largest active glaciers in the United States outside
  of Alaska.East of these Pacific Coast Ranges the Troughs of the Coastal Margin contain
  the only extensive lowland plains of the Pacific margin—California’s Central Valley,
  Oregon’s Willamette River valley, and the half-drowned basin of Puget Sound in Washington.
  Parts of an inland trench that extends for great distances along the east coast
  of the Pacific, similar valleys occur in such diverse areas as Chile and the Alaska
  panhandle. These valleys are blessed with superior soils, easily irrigated, and
  very accessible from the Pacific. They have enticed settlers for more than a century
  and have become the main centres of population and economic activity for much of
  the U.S. West Coast.Still farther east rise the two highest mountain chains in the
  coterminous United States—the Cascades and the Sierra Nevada. Aside from elevation,
  geographic continuity, and spectacular scenery, however, the two ranges differ in
  almost every important respect. Except for its northern section, where sedimentary
  and metamorphic rocks occur, the Sierra Nevada is largely made of granite, part
  of the same batholithic chain that creates the Idaho Rockies. The range is grossly
  asymmetrical, the result of massive faulting that has gently tilted the western
  slopes toward the Central Valley but has uplifted the eastern side to confront the
  interior with an escarpment nearly two miles high. At high elevation glaciers have
  scoured the granites to a gleaming white, while on the west the ice has carved spectacular
  valleys such as the Yosemite. The loftiest peak in the Sierras is Mount Whitney,
  which at 14,494 feet (4,418 metres) is the highest mountain in the coterminous states.
  The upfaulting that produced Mount Whitney is accompanied by downfaulting that formed
  nearby Death Valley, at 282 feet (86 metres) below sea level the lowest point in
  North America.The Cascades are made largely of volcanic rock; those in northern
  Washington contain granite like the Sierras, but the rest are formed from relatively
  recent lava outpourings of dun-coloured basalt and andesite. The Cascades are in
  effect two ranges. The lower, older range is a long belt of upwarped lava, rising
  unspectacularly to elevations between 6,000 and 8,000 feet. Perched above the “low
  Cascades” is a chain of lofty volcanoes that punctuate the horizon with magnificent
  glacier-clad peaks. The highest is Mount Rainier, which at 14,410 feet (4,392 metres)
  is all the more dramatic for rising from near sea level. Most of these volcanoes
  are quiescent, but they are far from extinct. Mount Lassen in northern California
  erupted violently in 1914, as did Mount St. Helens in the state of Washington in
  1980. Most of the other high Cascade volcanoes exhibit some sign of seismic activity.The
  Western Intermontane RegionBeartooth Range© John ElkThe Cordillera’s two main chains
  enclose a vast intermontane region of arid basins, plateaus, and isolated mountain
  ranges that stretches from the Mexican border nearly to Canada and extends 600 miles
  from east to west. This enormous territory contains three huge subregions, each
  with a distinctive geologic history and its own striking topography.The Colorado
  Plateau, nestled against the western flanks of the Southern Rockies, is an extraordinary
  island of geologic stability set in the turbulent sea of Cordilleran tectonic activity.
  Stability was not absolute, of course, so that parts of the plateau are warped and
  injected with volcanics, but in general the landscape results from the erosion by
  streams of nearly flat-lying sedimentary rocks. The result is a mosaic of angular
  mesas, buttes, and steplike canyons intricately cut from rocks that often are vividly
  coloured. Large areas of the plateau are so improbably picturesque that they have
  been set aside as national preserves. The Grand Canyon of the Colorado River is
  the most famous of several dozen such areas.West of the plateau and abutting the
  Sierra Nevada’s eastern escarpment lies the arid Basin and Range subregion, among
  the most remarkable topographic provinces of the United States. The Basin and Range
  extends from southern Oregon and Idaho into northern Mexico. Rocks of great complexity
  have been broken by faulting, and the resulting blocks have tumbled, eroded, and
  been partly buried by lava and alluvial debris accumulating in the desert basins.
  The eroded blocks form mountain ranges that are characteristically dozens of miles
  long, several thousand feet from base to crest, with peak elevations that rarely
  rise to more than 10,000 feet, and almost always aligned roughly north–south. The
  basin floors are typically alluvium and sometimes salt marshes or alkali flats.The
  third intermontane region, the Columbia Basin, is literally the last, for in some
  parts its rocks are still being formed. Its entire area is underlain by innumerable
  tabular lava flows that have flooded the basin between the Cascades and Northern
  Rockies to undetermined depths. The volume of lava must be measured in thousands
  of cubic miles, for the flows blanket large parts of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho
  and in southern Idaho have drowned the flanks of the Northern Rocky Mountains in
  a basaltic sea. Where the lavas are fresh, as in southern Idaho, the surface is
  often nearly flat, but more often the floors have been trenched by rivers—conspicuously
  the Columbia and the Snake—or by glacial floodwaters that have carved an intricate
  system of braided canyons in the remarkable Channeled Scablands of eastern Washington.
  In surface form the eroded lava often resembles the topography of the Colorado Plateau,
  but the gaudy colours of the Colorado are replaced here by the sombre black and
  rusty brown of weathered basalt.Most large mountain systems are sources of varied
  mineral wealth, and the American Cordillera is no exception. Metallic minerals have
  been taken from most crystalline regions and have furnished the United States with
  both romance and wealth—the Sierra Nevada gold that provoked the 1849 gold rush,
  the fabulous silver lodes of western Nevada’s Basin and Range, and gold strikes
  all along the Rocky Mountain chain. Industrial metals, however, are now far more
  important; copper and lead are among the base metals, and the more exotic molybdenum,
  vanadium, and cadmium are mainly useful in alloys.In the Cordillera, as elsewhere,
  the greatest wealth stems from fuels. Most major basins contain oil and natural
  gas, conspicuously the Wyoming Basin, the Central Valley of California, and the
  Los Angeles Basin. The Colorado Plateau, however, has yielded some of the most interesting
  discoveries—considerable deposits of uranium and colossal occurrences of oil shale.
  Oil from the shale, however, probably cannot be economically removed without widespread
  strip-mining and correspondingly large-scale damage to the environment. Wide exploitation
  of low-sulfur bituminous coal has been initiated in the Four Corners area of the
  Colorado Plateau, and open-pit mining has already devastated parts of this once-pristine
  country as completely as it has West Virginia.DrainageAs befits a nation of continental
  proportions, the United States has an extraordinary network of rivers and lakes,
  including some of the largest and most useful in the world. In the humid East they
  provide an enormous mileage of cheap inland transportation; westward, most rivers
  and streams are unnavigable but are heavily used for irrigation and power generation.
  Both East and West, however, traditionally have used lakes and streams as public
  sewers, and despite efforts to clean them up, most large waterways are laden with
  vast, poisonous volumes of industrial, agricultural, and human wastes.The Eastern
  systemsChief among U.S. rivers is the Mississippi, which, with its great tributaries,
  the Ohio and the Missouri, drains most of the midcontinent. The Mississippi is navigable
  to Minneapolis nearly 1,200 miles by air from the Gulf of Mexico; and along with
  the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence system it forms the world’s greatest network of inland
  waterways. The Mississippi’s eastern branches, chiefly the Ohio and the Tennessee,
  are also navigable for great distances. From the west, however, many of its numerous
  Great Plains tributaries are too seasonal and choked with sandbars to be used for
  shipping. The Missouri, for example, though longer than the Mississippi itself,
  was essentially without navigation until the mid-20th century, when a combination
  of dams, locks, and dredging opened the river to barge traffic.The Great Lakes–St.
  Lawrence system, the other half of the midcontinental inland waterway, is connected
  to the Mississippi–Ohio via Chicago by canals and the Illinois River. The five Great
  Lakes (four of which are shared with Canada) constitute by far the largest freshwater
  lake group in the world and carry a larger tonnage of shipping than any other. The
  three main barriers to navigation—the St. Marys Rapids, at Sault Sainte Marie; Niagara
  Falls; and the rapids of the St. Lawrence—are all bypassed by locks, whose 27-foot
  draft lets ocean vessels penetrate 1,300 miles into the continent, as far as Duluth,
  Minnesota, and Chicago.The third group of Eastern rivers drains the coastal strip
  along the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Except for the Rio Grande, which
  rises west of the Rockies and flows about 1,900 circuitous miles to the Gulf, few
  of these coastal rivers measure more than 300 miles, and most flow in an almost
  straight line to the sea. Except in glaciated New England and in arid southwestern
  Texas, most of the larger coastal streams are navigable for some distance.The Pacific
  systemsWest of the Rockies, nearly all of the rivers are strongly influenced by
  aridity. In the deserts and steppes of the intermontane basins, most of the scanty
  runoff disappears into interior basins, only one of which, the Great Salt Lake,
  holds any substantial volume of water. Aside from a few minor coastal streams, only
  three large river systems manage to reach the sea—the Columbia, the Colorado, and
  the San Joaquin–Sacramento system of California’s Central Valley. All three of these
  river systems are exotic: that is, they flow for considerable distances across dry
  lands from which they receive little water. Both the Columbia and the Colorado have
  carved awesome gorges, the former through the sombre lavas of the Cascades and the
  Columbia Basin, the latter through the brilliantly coloured rocks of the Colorado
  Plateau. These gorges lend themselves to easy damming, and the once-wild Columbia
  has been turned into a stairway of placid lakes whose waters irrigate the arid plateaus
  of eastern Washington and power one of the world’s largest hydroelectric networks.
  The Colorado is less extensively developed, and proposals for new dam construction
  have met fierce opposition from those who want to preserve the spectacular natural
  beauty of the river’s canyon lands.ClimateClimate affects human habitats both directly
  and indirectly through its influence on vegetation, soils, and wildlife. In the
  United States, however, the natural environment has been altered drastically by
  nearly four centuries of European settlement, as well as thousands of years of Indian
  occupancy.Wherever land is abandoned, however, “wild” conditions return rapidly,
  achieving over the long run a dynamic equilibrium among soils, vegetation, and the
  inexorable strictures of climate. Thus, though Americans have created an artificial
  environment of continental proportions, the United States still can be divided into
  a mosaic of bioclimatic regions, each of them distinguished by peculiar climatic
  conditions and each with a potential vegetation and soil that eventually would return
  in the absence of humans. The main exception to this generalization applies to fauna,
  so drastically altered that it is almost impossible to know what sort of animal
  geography would redevelop in the areas of the United States if humans were removed
  from the scene.Climatic controlsThe pattern of U.S. climates is largely set by the
  location of the coterminous United States almost entirely in the middle latitudes,
  by its position with respect to the continental landmass and its fringing oceans,
  and by the nation’s gross pattern of mountains and lowlands. Each of these geographic
  controls operates to determine the character of air masses and their changing behaviour
  from season to season.The coterminous United States lies entirely between the tropic
  of Cancer and 50° N latitude, a position that confines Arctic climates to the high
  mountaintops and genuine tropics to a small part of southern Florida. By no means,
  however, is the climate literally temperate, for the middle latitudes are notorious
  for extreme variations of temperature and precipitation.The great size of the North
  American landmass tends to reinforce these extremes. Since land heats and cools
  more rapidly than bodies of water, places distant from an ocean tend to have continental
  climates; that is, they alternate between extremes of hot summers and cold winters,
  in contrast to the marine climates, which are more equable. Most U.S. climates are
  markedly continental, the more so because the Cordillera effectively confines the
  moderating Pacific influence to a narrow strip along the West Coast. Extremes of
  continentality occur near the centre of the country, and in North Dakota temperatures
  have ranged between a summer high record of 121 °F (49 °C) and a winter low of −60
  °F (−51 °C). Moreover, the general eastward drift of air over the United States
  carries continental temperatures all the way to the Atlantic coast. Bismarck, N.D.,
  for example, has a great annual temperature range. Boston, on the Atlantic but largely
  exempt from its influence, has a lesser but still-continental range, while San Francisco,
  which is under strong Pacific influence, has only a small summer–winter differential.In
  addition to confining Pacific temperatures to the coastal margin, the Pacific Coast
  Ranges are high enough to make a local rain shadow in their lee, although the main
  barrier is the great rampart formed by the Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges. Rainy
  on their western slopes and barren on the east, this mountain crest forms one of
  the sharpest climatic divides in the United States.The rain shadow continues east
  to the Rockies, leaving the entire Intermontane Region either arid or semiarid,
  except where isolated ranges manage to capture leftover moisture at high altitudes.
  East of the Rockies the westerly drift brings mainly dry air, and as a result, the
  Great Plains are semiarid. Still farther east, humidity increases owing to the frequent
  incursion from the south of warm, moist, and unstable air from the Gulf of Mexico,
  which produces more precipitation in the United States than the Pacific and Atlantic
  oceans combined.Although the landforms of the Interior Lowlands have been termed
  dull, there is nothing dull about their weather conditions. Air from the Gulf of
  Mexico can flow northward across the Great Plains, uninterrupted by topographical
  barriers, but continental Canadian air flows south by the same route, and, since
  these two air masses differ in every important respect, the collisions often produce
  disturbances of monumental violence. Plainsmen and Midwesterners are accustomed
  to sudden displays of furious weather—tornadoes, blizzards, hailstorms, precipitous
  drops and rises in temperature, and a host of other spectacular meteorological displays,
  sometimes dangerous but seldom boring.The change of seasonsMost of the United States
  is marked by sharp differences between winter and summer. In winter, when temperature
  contrasts between land and water are greatest, huge masses of frigid, dry Canadian
  air periodically spread far south over the midcontinent, bringing cold, sparkling
  weather to the interior and generating great cyclonic storms where their leading
  edges confront the shrunken mass of warm Gulf air to the south. Although such cyclonic
  activity occurs throughout the year, it is most frequent and intense during the
  winter, parading eastward out of the Great Plains to bring the Eastern states practically
  all their winter precipitation. Winter temperatures differ widely, depending largely
  on latitude. Thus, New Orleans, La., at 30° N latitude, and International Falls,
  Minn., at 49° N, have respective January temperature averages of 55 °F (13 °C) and
  3 °F (−16° C). In the north, therefore, precipitation often comes as snow, often
  driven by furious winds; farther south, cold rain alternates with sleet and occasional
  snow. Southern Florida is the only dependably warm part of the East, though “polar
  outbursts” have been known to bring temperatures below 0 °F (−18 °C) as far south
  as Tallahassee. The main uniformity of Eastern weather in wintertime is the expectation
  of frequent change.Winter climate on the West Coast is very different. A great spiraling
  mass of relatively warm, moist air spreads south from the Aleutian Islands of Alaska,
  its semipermanent front producing gloomy overcast and drizzles that hang over the
  Pacific Northwest all winter long, occasionally reaching southern California, which
  receives nearly all of its rain at this time of year. This Pacific air brings mild
  temperatures along the length of the coast; the average January day in Seattle,
  Wash., ranges between 33 and 44 °F (1 and 7 °C) and in Los Angeles between 45 and
  64 °F (7 and 18 °C). In southern California, however, rains are separated by long
  spells of fair weather, and the whole region is a winter haven for those seeking
  refuge from less agreeable weather in other parts of the country. The Intermontane
  Region is similar to the Pacific Coast, but with much less rainfall and a considerably
  wider range of temperatures.During the summer there is a reversal of the air masses,
  and east of the Rockies the change resembles the summer monsoon of Southeast Asia.
  As the midcontinent heats up, the cold Canadian air mass weakens and retreats, pushed
  north by an aggressive mass of warm, moist air from the Gulf. The great winter temperature
  differential between North and South disappears as the hot, soggy blanket spreads
  from the Gulf coast to the Canadian border. Heat and humidity are naturally most
  oppressive in the South, but there is little comfort in the more northern latitudes.
  In Houston, Texas, the temperature on a typical July day reaches 93 °F (34 °C),
  with relative humidity averaging near 75 percent, but Minneapolis, Minn., more than
  1,000 miles north, is only slightly cooler and less humid.Since the Gulf air is
  unstable as well as wet, convectional and frontal summer thunderstorms are endemic
  east of the Rockies, accounting for a majority of total summer rain. These storms
  usually drench small areas with short-lived, sometimes violent downpours, so that
  crops in one Midwestern county may prosper, those in another shrivel in drought,
  and those in yet another be flattened by hailstones. Relief from the humid heat
  comes in the northern Midwest from occasional outbursts of cool Canadian air; small
  but more consistent relief is found downwind from the Great Lakes and at high elevations
  in the Appalachians. East of the Rockies, however, U.S. summers are distinctly uncomfortable,
  and air conditioning is viewed as a desirable amenity in most areas.The Pacific
  Region: GeographyEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Again, the Pacific regime is different.
  The moist Aleutian air retreats northward, to be replaced by mild, stable air from
  over the subtropical but cool waters of the Pacific, and except in the mountains
  the Pacific Coast is nearly rainless though often foggy. In the meanwhile, a small
  but potent mass of dry hot air raises temperatures to blistering levels over much
  of the intermontane Southwest. In Yuma, Ariz., for example, the normal temperature
  in July reaches 107 °F (42 °C), while nearby Death Valley, Calif., holds the national
  record, 134 °F (57 °C). During its summer peak this scorching air mass spreads from
  the Pacific margin as far as Texas on the east and Idaho to the north, turning the
  whole interior basin into a summer desert.Over most of the United States, as in
  most continental climates, spring and autumn are agreeable but disappointingly brief.
  Autumn is particularly idyllic in the East, with a romantic Indian summer of ripening
  corn and brilliantly coloured foliage and of mild days and frosty nights. The shift
  in dominance between marine and continental air masses, however, spawns furious
  weather in some regions. Along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, for example, autumn
  is the season for hurricanes—the American equivalent of typhoons of the Asian Pacific—which
  rage northward from the warm tropics to create havoc along the Gulf and Atlantic
  coasts as far north as New England. The Mississippi valley holds the dubious distinction
  of recording more tornadoes than any other area on Earth. These violent and often
  deadly storms usually occur over relatively small areas and are confined largely
  to spring and early summer.The bioclimatic regionsThree first-order bioclimatic
  zones encompass most of the coterminous United States—regions in which climatic
  conditions are similar enough to dictate similar conditions of mature (zonal) soil
  and potential climax vegetation (i.e., the assemblage of plants that would grow
  and reproduce indefinitely given stable climate and average conditions of soil and
  drainage). These are the Humid East, the Humid Pacific Coast, and the Dry West.
  In addition, the boundary zone between the Humid East and the Dry West is so large
  and important that it constitutes a separate region, the Humid–Arid Transition.
  Finally, because the Western Cordillera contains an intricate mosaic of climatic
  types, largely determined by local elevation and exposure, it is useful to distinguish
  the Western Mountain Climate. The first three zones, however, are very diverse and
  require further breakdown, producing a total of 10 main bioclimatic regions. For
  two reasons, the boundaries of these bioclimatic regions are much less distinct
  than boundaries of landform regions. First, climate varies from year to year, especially
  in boundary zones, whereas landforms obviously do not. Second, regions of climate,
  vegetation, and soils coincide generally but sometimes not precisely. Boundaries,
  therefore, should be interpreted as zonal and transitional, and rarely should be
  considered as sharp lines in the landscape.For all of their indistinct boundaries,
  however, these bioclimatic regions have strong and easily recognized identities.
  Such regional identity is strongly reinforced when a particular area falls entirely
  within a single bioclimatic region and at the same time a single landform region.
  The result—as in the Piedmont South, the central Midwest, or the western Great Plains—is
  a landscape with an unmistakable regional personality.The Humid EastThe largest
  and in some ways the most important of the bioclimatic zones, the Humid East was
  where the Europeans first settled, tamed the land, and adapted to American conditions.
  In early times almost all of this territory was forested, a fact of central importance
  in American history that profoundly influenced both soils and wildlife. As in most
  of the world’s humid lands, soluble minerals have been leached from the earth, leaving
  a great family of soils called pedalfers, rich in relatively insoluble iron and
  aluminum compounds.Both forests and soils, however, differ considerably within this
  vast region. Since rainfall is ample and summers are warm everywhere, the main differences
  result from the length and severity of winters, which determine the length of the
  growing season. Winter, obviously, differs according to latitude, so that the Humid
  East is sliced into four great east–west bands of soils and vegetation, with progressively
  more amenable winters as one travels southward. These changes occur very gradually,
  however, and the boundaries therefore are extremely subtle.The Sub-Boreal Forest
  Region is the northernmost of these bands. It is only a small and discontinuous
  part of the United States, representing the tattered southern fringe of the vast
  Canadian taiga—a scrubby forest dominated by evergreen needle-leaf species that
  can endure the ferocious winters and reproduce during the short, erratic summers.
  Average growing seasons are less than 120 days, though localities in Michigan’s
  Upper Peninsula have recorded frost-free periods lasting as long as 161 days and
  as short as 76 days. Soils of this region that survived the scour of glaciation
  are miserably thin podzols—heavily leached, highly acid, and often interrupted by
  extensive stretches of bog. Most attempts at farming in the region long since have
  been abandoned.Farther south lies the Humid Microthermal Zone of milder winters
  and longer summers. Large broadleaf trees begin to predominate over the evergreens,
  producing a mixed forest of greater floristic variety and economic value that is
  famous for its brilliant autumn colours. As the forest grows richer in species,
  sterile podzols give way to more productive gray-brown podzolic soils, stained and
  fertilized with humus. Although winters are warmer than in the Sub-Boreal zone,
  and although the Great Lakes help temper the bitterest cold, January temperatures
  ordinarily average below freezing, and a winter without a few days of subzero temperatures
  is uncommon. Everywhere, the ground is solidly frozen and snow covered for several
  months of the year.Still farther south are the Humid Subtropics. The region’s northern
  boundary is one of the country’s most significant climatic lines: the approximate
  northern limit of a growing season of 180–200 days, the outer margin of cotton growing,
  and, hence, of the Old South. Most of the South lies in the Piedmont and Coastal
  Plain, for higher elevations in the Appalachians cause a peninsula of Northern mixed
  forest to extend as far south as northern Georgia. The red-brown podzolic soil,
  once moderately fertile, has been severely damaged by overcropping and burning.
  Thus much of the region that once sustained a rich, broadleaf-forest flora now supports
  poor piney woods. Throughout the South, summers are hot, muggy, long, and disagreeable;
  Dixie’s “frosty mornings” bring a welcome respite in winter.The southern margins
  of Florida contain the only real tropics in the coterminous United States; it is
  an area in which frost is almost unknown. Hot, rainy summers alternate with warm
  and somewhat drier winters, with a secondary rainfall peak during the autumn hurricane
  season—altogether a typical monsoonal regime. Soils and vegetation are mostly immature,
  however, since southern Florida rises so slightly above sea level that substantial
  areas, such as the Everglades, are swampy and often brackish. Peat and sand frequently
  masquerade as soil, and much of the vegetation is either salt-loving mangrove or
  sawgrass prairie.The Humid Pacific CoastThe western humid region differs from its
  eastern counterpart in so many ways as to be a world apart. Much smaller, it is
  crammed into a narrow littoral belt to the windward of the Sierra–Cascade summit,
  dominated by mild Pacific air, and chopped by irregular topography into an intricate
  mosaic of climatic and biotic habitats. Throughout the region rainfall is extremely
  seasonal, falling mostly in the winter half of the year. Summers are droughty everywhere,
  but the main regional differences come from the length of drought—from about two
  months in humid Seattle, Wash., to nearly five months in semiarid San Diego, Calif.Western
  Washington, Oregon, and northern California lie within a zone that climatologists
  call Marine West Coast. Winters are raw, overcast, and drizzly—not unlike northwestern
  Europe—with subfreezing temperatures restricted mainly to the mountains, upon which
  enormous snow accumulations produce local alpine glaciers. Summers, by contrast,
  are brilliantly cloudless, cool, and frequently foggy along the West Coast and somewhat
  warmer in the inland valleys. This mild marine climate produces some of the world’s
  greatest forests of enormous straight-boled evergreen trees that furnish the United
  States with much of its commercial timber. Mature soils are typical of humid midlatitude
  forestlands, a moderately leached gray-brown podzol.Toward the south, with diminishing
  coastal rain the moist marine climate gradually gives way to California’s tiny but
  much-publicized Mediterranean regime. Although mountainous topography introduces
  a bewildering variety of local environments, scanty winter rains are quite inadequate
  to compensate for the long summer drought, and much of the region has a distinctly
  arid character. For much of the year, cool, stable Pacific air dominates the West
  Coast, bringing San Francisco its famous fogs and Los Angeles its infamous smoggy
  temperature inversions. Inland, however, summer temperatures reach blistering levels,
  so that in July, while Los Angeles expects a normal daily maximum of 83 °F (28 °C),
  Fresno expects 100 °F (38 °C) and is climatically a desert. As might be expected,
  Mediterranean California contains a huge variety of vegetal habitats, but the commonest
  perhaps is the chaparral, a drought-resistant, scrubby woodland of twisted hard-leafed
  trees, picturesque but of little economic value. Chaparral is a pyrophytic (fire-loving)
  vegetation—i.e., under natural conditions its growth and form depend on regular
  burning. These fires constitute a major environmental hazard in the suburban hills
  above Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay, especially in autumn, when hot dry Santa
  Ana winds from the interior regularly convert brush fires into infernos. Soils are
  similarly varied, but most of them are light in colour and rich in soluble minerals,
  qualities typical of subarid soils.The Dry WestIn the United States, to speak of
  dry areas is to speak of the West. It covers an enormous region beyond the dependable
  reach of moist oceanic air, occupying the entire Intermontane area and sprawling
  from Canada to Mexico across the western part of the Great Plains. To Americans
  nurtured in the Humid East, this vast territory across the path of all transcontinental
  travelers has been harder to tame than any other—and no region has so gripped the
  national imagination as this fierce and dangerous land.In the Dry West nothing matters
  more than water. Thus, though temperatures may differ radically from place to place,
  the really important regional differences depend overwhelmingly on the degree of
  aridity, whether an area is extremely dry and hence desert or semiarid and therefore
  steppe.Americans of the 19th century were preoccupied by the myth of a Great American
  Desert, which supposedly occupied more than one-third of the entire country. True
  desert, however, is confined to the Southwest, with patchy outliers elsewhere, all
  without exception located in the lowland rain shadows of the Cordillera. Vegetation
  in these desert areas varies between nothing at all (a rare circumstance confined
  mainly to salt flats and sand dunes) to a low cover of scattered woody scrub and
  short-lived annuals that burst into flamboyant bloom after rains. Soils are usually
  thin, light-coloured, and very rich with mineral salts. In some areas wind erosion
  has removed fine-grained material, leaving behind desert pavement, a barren veneer
  of broken rock.Most of the West, however, lies in the semiarid region, in which
  rainfall is scanty but adequate to support a thin cover of short bunchgrass, commonly
  alternating with scrubby brush. Here, as in the desert, soils fall into the large
  family of the pedocals, rich in calcium and other soluble minerals, but in the slightly
  wetter environments of the West, they are enriched with humus from decomposed grass
  roots. Under the proper type of management, these chestnut-coloured steppe soils
  have the potential to be very fertile.Weather in the West resembles that of other
  dry regions of the world, often extreme, violent, and reliably unreliable. Rainfall,
  for example, obeys a cruel natural law: as total precipitation decreases, it becomes
  more undependable. John Steinbeck’s novel The Grapes of Wrath describes the problems
  of a family enticed to the arid frontier of Oklahoma during a wet period only to
  be driven out by the savage drought of the 1930s that turned the western Great Plains
  into the great American Dust Bowl. Temperatures in the West also fluctuate convulsively
  within short periods, and high winds are infamous throughout the region.The Humid–Arid
  TransitionEast of the Rockies all climatic boundaries are gradational. None, however,
  is so important or so imperceptibly subtle as the boundary zone that separates the
  Humid East from the Dry West and that alternates unpredictably between arid and
  humid conditions from year to year. Stretching approximately from Texas to North
  Dakota in an ill-defined band between the 95th and 100th meridians, this transitional
  region deserves separate recognition, partly because of its great size, and partly
  because of the fine balance between surplus and deficit rainfall, which produces
  a unique and valuable combination of soils, flora, and fauna. The native vegetation,
  insofar as it can be reconstructed, was prairie, the legendary sea of tall, deep-rooted
  grass now almost entirely tilled and planted to grains. Soils, often of loessial
  derivation, include the enormously productive chernozem (black earth) in the north,
  with reddish prairie soils of nearly equal fertility in the south. Throughout the
  region temperatures are severely continental, with bitterly cold winters in the
  north and scorching summers everywhere.The western edge of the prairie fades gradually
  into the shortgrass steppe of the High Plains, the change a function of diminishing
  rainfall. The eastern edge, however, represents one of the few major discordances
  between a climatic and biotic boundary in the United States, for the grassland penetrates
  the eastern forest in a great salient across humid Illinois and Indiana. Many scholars
  believe this part of the prairie was artificially induced by repeated burning and
  consequent destruction of the forest margins by Indians.The Western mountainsThroughout
  the Cordillera and Intermontane regions, irregular topography shatters the grand
  bioclimatic pattern into an intricate mosaic of tiny regions that differ drastically
  according to elevation and exposure. No small- or medium-scale map can accurately
  record such complexity, and mountainous parts of the West are said, noncommittally,
  to have a “mountain climate.” Lowlands are usually dry, but increasing elevation
  brings lower temperature, decreased evaporation, and—if a slope faces prevailing
  winds—greater precipitation. Soils vary wildly from place to place, but vegetation
  is fairly predictable. From the desert or steppe of intermontane valleys, a climber
  typically ascends into parklike savanna, then through an orderly sequence of increasingly
  humid and boreal forests until, if the range is high enough, one reaches the timberline
  and Arctic tundra. The very highest peaks are snow-capped, although permanent glaciers
  rarely occur outside the cool humid highlands of the Pacific Northwest.Peirce F.
  LewisPlant lifeThe dominant features of the vegetation are indicated by the terms
  forest, grassland, desert, and alpine tundra.A coniferous forest of white and red
  pine, hemlock, spruce, jack pine, and balsam fir extends interruptedly in a narrow
  strip near the Canadian border from Maine to Minnesota and southward along the Appalachian
  Mountains. There may be found smaller stands of tamarack, spruce, paper birch, willow,
  alder, and aspen or poplar. Southward, a transition zone of mixed conifers and deciduous
  trees gives way to a hardwood forest of broad-leaved trees. This forest, with varying
  mixtures of maple, oak, ash, locust, linden, sweet gum, walnut, hickory, sycamore,
  beech, and the more southerly tulip tree, once extended uninterruptedly from New
  England to Missouri and eastern Texas. Pines are prominent on the Atlantic and Gulf
  coastal plain and adjacent uplands, often occurring in nearly pure stands called
  pine barrens. Pitch, longleaf, slash, shortleaf, Virginia, and loblolly pines are
  commonest. Hickory and various oaks combine to form a significant part of this forest,
  with magnolia, white cedar, and ash often seen. In the frequent swamps, bald cypress,
  tupelo, and white cedar predominate. Pines, palmettos, and live oaks are replaced
  at the southern tip of Florida by the more tropical royal and thatch palms, figs,
  satinwood, and mangrove.The grasslands occur principally in the Great Plains area
  and extend westward into the intermontane basins and benchlands of the Rocky Mountains.
  Numerous grasses such as buffalo, grama, side oat, bunch, needle, and wheat grass,
  together with many kinds of herbs, make up the plant cover. Coniferous forests cover
  the lesser mountains and high plateaus of the Rockies, Cascades, and Sierra Nevada.
  Ponderosa (yellow) pine, Douglas fir, western red cedar, western larch, white pine,
  lodgepole pine, several spruces, western hemlock, grand fir, red fir, and the lofty
  redwood are the principal trees of these forests. The densest growth occurs west
  of the Cascade and Coast ranges in Washington, Oregon, and northern California,
  where the trees are often 100 feet or more in height. There the forest floor is
  so dark that only ferns, mosses, and a few shade-loving shrubs and herbs may be
  found.Arizona: Saguaro National MonumentEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The alpine
  tundra, located in the coterminous United States only in the mountains above the
  limit of trees, consists principally of small plants that bloom brilliantly for
  a short season. Sagebrush is the most common plant of the arid basins and semideserts
  west of the Rocky Mountains, but juniper, nut pine, and mountain mahogany are often
  found on the slopes and low ridges. The desert, extending from southeastern California
  to Texas, is noted for the many species of cactus, some of which grow to the height
  of trees, and for the Joshua tree and other yuccas, creosote bush, mesquite, and
  acacias.The United States is rich in the variety of its native forest trees, some
  of which, as the species of sequoia, are the most massive known. More than 1,000
  species and varieties have been described, of which almost 200 are of economic value,
  either because of the timber and other useful products that they yield or by reason
  of their importance in forestry.Besides the native flowering plants, estimated at
  between 20,000 to 25,000 species, many hundreds of species introduced from other
  regions—chiefly Europe, Asia, and tropical America—have become naturalized. A large
  proportion of these are common annual weeds of fields, pastures, and roadsides.
  In some districts these naturalized “aliens” constitute 50 percent or more of the
  total plant population.Paul H. OehserReed C. RollinsEd.Animal lifeWith most of North
  America, the United States lies in the Nearctic faunistic realm, a region containing
  an assemblage of species similar to Eurasia and North Africa but sharply different
  from the tropical and subtropical zones to the south. Main regional differences
  correspond roughly with primary climatic and vegetal patterns. Thus, for example,
  the animal communities of the Dry West differ sharply from those of the Humid East
  and from those of the Pacific Coast. Because animals tend to range over wider areas
  than plants, faunal regions are generally coarser than vegetal regions and harder
  to delineate sharply.The animal geography of the United States, however, is far
  from a natural pattern, for European settlement produced a series of environmental
  changes that grossly altered the distribution of animal communities. First, many
  species were hunted to extinction or near extinction, most conspicuously, perhaps,
  the American bison, which ranged by the millions nearly from coast to coast but
  now rarely lives outside of zoos and wildlife preserves. Second, habitats were upset
  or destroyed throughout most of the country—forests cut, grasslands plowed and overgrazed,
  and migration paths interrupted by fences, railroads, and highways. Third, certain
  introduced species found hospitable niches and, like the English sparrow, spread
  over huge areas, often preempting the habitats of native animals. Fourth, though
  their effects are not fully understood, chemical biocides such as DDT were used
  for so long and in such volume that they are believed at least partly responsible
  for catastrophic mortality rates among large mammals and birds, especially predators
  high on the food chain. Fifth, there has been a gradual northward migration of certain
  tropical and subtropical insects, birds, and mammals, perhaps encouraged by gradual
  climatic warming. In consequence, many native animals have been reduced to tiny
  fractions of their former ranges or exterminated completely, while other animals,
  both native and introduced, have found the new anthropocentric environment well
  suited to their needs, with explosive effects on their populations. The coyote,
  opossum, armadillo, and several species of deer are among the animals that now occupy
  much larger ranges than they once did.Peirce F. LewisArrangement of the account
  of the distribution of the fauna according to the climatic and vegetal regions has
  the merit that it can be compared further with the distribution of insects and of
  other invertebrates, some of which may be expected to fall into the same patterns
  as the vertebrates, while others, with different modes or different ages of dispersal,
  have geographic patterns of their own.The transcontinental zone of coniferous forest
  at the north, the taiga, and the tundra zone into which it merges at the northern
  limit of tree growth are strikingly paralleled by similar vertical zones in the
  Rockies, and on Mount Washington in the east, where the area above the timberline
  and below the snow line is often inhabited with tundra animals like the ptarmigan
  and the white Parnassius butterflies, while the spruce and other conifers below
  the timberline form a belt sharply set off from the grassland or hardwood forest
  or desert at still lower altitudes.A whole series of important types of animals
  spread beyond the limits of such regions or zones, sometimes over most of the continent.
  Aquatic animals, in particular, may live equally in forest and plains, in the Gulf
  states, and at the Canadian border. Such widespread animals include the white-tailed
  (Virginia) deer and black bear, the puma (though only in the remotest parts of its
  former range) and bobcat, the river otter (though now rare in inland areas south
  of the Great Lakes) and mink, and the beaver and muskrat. The distinctive coyote
  ranges over all of western North America and eastward as far as Maine. The snapping
  turtle ranges from the Atlantic coast to the Rocky Mountains.In the northern coniferous
  forest zone, or taiga, the relations of animals with European or Eurasian representatives
  are numerous, and this zone is also essentially circumpolar. The relations are less
  close than in the Arctic forms, but the moose, beaver, hare, red fox, otter, wolverine,
  and wolf are recognizably related to Eurasian animals. Even some fishes, like the
  whitefishes (Coregonidae), the yellow perch, and the pike, exhibit this kind of
  Old World–New World relation. A distinctively North American animal in this taiga
  assemblage is the Canadian porcupine.The hardwood forest area of the eastern and
  the southeastern pinelands compose the most important of the faunal regions within
  the United States. A great variety of fishes, amphibians, and reptiles of this region
  have related forms in East Asia, and this pattern of representation is likewise
  found in the flora. This area is rich in catfishes, minnows, and suckers. The curious
  ganoid fishes, the bowfin and the gar, are ancient types. The spoonbill cat, a remarkable
  type of sturgeon in the lower Mississippi, is represented elsewhere in the world
  only in the Yangtze in China. The Appalachian region is headquarters for the salamanders
  of the world, with no less than seven of the eight families of this large group
  of amphibians represented; no other continent has more than three of the eight families
  together. The eellike sirens and amphiumas (congo snakes) are confined to the southeastern
  states. The lungless salamanders of the family Plethodontidae exhibit a remarkable
  variety of genera and a number of species centring in the Appalachians. There is
  a great variety of frogs, and these include tree frogs whose main development is
  South American and Australian. The emydid freshwater turtles of the southeast parallel
  those of East Asia to a remarkable degree, though the genus Clemmys is the only
  one represented in both regions. Much the same is true of the water snakes, pit
  vipers, rat snakes, and green snakes, though still others are peculiarly American.
  The familiar alligator is a form with an Asiatic relative, the only other living
  true alligator being a species in central China.In its mammals and birds the southeastern
  fauna is less sharply distinguished from the life to the north and west and is less
  directly related to that of East Asia. The forest is the home of the white-tailed
  deer, the black bear, the gray fox, the raccoon, and the common opossum. The wild
  turkey and the extinct hosts of the passenger pigeon were characteristic. There
  is a remarkable variety of woodpeckers. The birdlife in general tends to differ
  from that of Eurasia in the presence of birds, like the tanagers, American orioles,
  and hummingbirds, that belong to South American families. Small mammals abound with
  types of the worldwide rodent family Cricetidae, and with distinctive moles and
  shrews.Most distinctive of the grassland animals proper is the American bison (see
  photograph), whose nearly extinct European relative, the wisent, is a forest dweller.
  The most distinctive of the American hoofed animals is the pronghorn, or prongbuck,
  which represents a family intermediate between the deer and the true antelopes in
  that it sheds its horns like a deer but retains the bony horn cores. The pronghorn
  is perhaps primarily a desert mammal, but it formerly ranged widely into the shortgrass
  plains. Everywhere in open country in the West there are conspicuous and distinctive
  rodents. The burrowing pocket gopher is peculiarly American, rarely seen making
  its presence known by pushed-out mounds of earth. The ground squirrels of the genus
  Citellus are related to those of Central Asia, and resemble them in habit; in North
  America the gregarious prairie dog is a closely related form. The American badger
  (see photograph), not especially related to the badger of Europe, has its headquarters
  in the grasslands. The prairie chicken is a bird distinctive of the plains region,
  which is invaded everywhere by birds from both the east and the west.The Southwestern
  deserts are a paradise for reptiles. Distinctive lizards such as the poisonous Gila
  monster abound, and the rattlesnakes, of which only a few species are found elsewhere
  in the United States, are common there. Desert reptile species often range to the
  Pacific Coast and northward into the Great Basin. Noteworthy mammals are the graceful
  bipedal kangaroo rat (almost exlusively nocturnal; see photograph), the ring-tailed
  cat, a relative of the raccoon, and the piglike peccary.The Rocky Mountains and
  other western ranges afford distinctive habitats for rock- and cliff-dwelling hoofed
  animals and rodents. The small pikas, related to the rabbit, inhabit talus areas
  at high altitudes as they do in the mountain ranges of East Asia. Marmots live in
  the Rockies as in the Alps. Every western range formerly had its own race of mountain
  sheep. At the north the Rocky Mountain goat lives at high altitudes—it is more properly
  a goat antelope, related to the takin of the mountains of western China. The dipper,
  remarkable for its habit of feeding in swift-flowing streams, though otherwise a
  bird without special aquatic adaptations, is a Rocky Mountain form with relatives
  in Asia and Europe.In the Pacific region the extremely distinctive primitive tailed
  frog Ascaphus, which inhabits icy mountain brooks, represents a family by itself,
  perhaps more nearly related to the frogs of New Zealand than to more familiar types.
  The Cascades and Sierras form centres for salamanders of the families Ambystomoidae
  and Plethodontidae second only to the Appalachians, and there are also distinctive
  newts. The burrowing lizards, of the well-defined family Anniellidae, are found
  only in a limited area in coastal California. The only family of birds distinctive
  of North America, that of the wren-tits, Chamaeidae, is found in the chaparral of
  California. The mountain beaver, or sewellel (which is not at all beaverlike), is
  likewise a type peculiar to North America, confined to the Cascades and Sierras,
  and there are distinct kinds of moles in the Pacific area.The mammals of the two
  coasts are strikingly different, though true seals (the harbour seal and the harp
  seal) are found on both. The sea lions, with longer necks and with projecting ears,
  are found only in the Pacific—the California sea lion, the more northern Steller’s
  sea lion, and the fur seal. On the East Coast the larger rivers of Florida are inhabited
  by the Florida manatee, or sea cow, a close relative of the more widespread and
  more distinctively marine West Indian species.Karl Patterson SchmidtEd.Settlement
  patternsUnited States: population densityEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Although the
  land that now constitutes the United States was occupied and much affected by diverse
  Indian cultures over many millennia, these pre-European settlement patterns have
  had virtually no impact upon the contemporary nation—except locally, as in parts
  of New Mexico. A benign habitat permitted a huge contiguous tract of settled land
  to materialize across nearly all the eastern half of the United States and within
  substantial patches of the West. The vastness of the land, the scarcity of labour,
  and the abundance of migratory opportunities in a land replete with raw physical
  resources contributed to exceptional human mobility and a quick succession of ephemeral
  forms of land use and settlement. Human endeavours have greatly transformed the
  landscape, but such efforts have been largely destructive. Most of the pre-European
  landscape in the United States was so swiftly and radically altered that it is difficult
  to conjecture intelligently about its earlier appearance.The overall impression
  of the settled portion of the American landscape, rural or urban, is one of disorder
  and incoherence, even in areas of strict geometric survey. The individual landscape
  unit is seldom in visual harmony with its neighbour, so that, however sound in design
  or construction the single structure may be, the general effect is untidy. These
  attributes have been intensified by the acute individualism of the American, vigorous
  speculation in land and other commodities, a strongly utilitarian attitude toward
  the land and the treasures above and below it, and government policy and law. The
  landscape is also remarkable for its extensive transportation facilities, which
  have greatly influenced the configuration of the land.Another special characteristic
  of American settlement, one that became obvious only by the mid-20th century, is
  the convergence of rural and urban modes of life. The farmsteads—and rural folk
  in general—have become increasingly urbanized, and agricultural operations have
  become more automated, while the metropolis grows more gelatinous, unfocused, and
  pseudo-bucolic along its margins.Rural settlementPatterns of rural settlement indicate
  much about the history, economy, society, and minds of those who created them as
  well as about the land itself. The essential design of rural activity in the United
  States bears a strong family resemblance to that of other neo-European lands, such
  as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, or tsarist Siberia—places
  that have undergone rapid occupation and exploitation by immigrants intent upon
  short-term development and enrichment. In all such areas, under novel social and
  political conditions and with a relative abundance of territory and physical resources,
  ideas and institutions derived from a relatively stable medieval or early modern
  Europe have undergone major transformation. Further, these are nonpeasant countrysides,
  alike in having failed to achieve the intimate symbiosis of people and habitat,
  the humanized rural landscapes characteristic of many relatively dense, stable,
  earthbound communities in parts of Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America.Early
  models of land allocationFrom the beginning the prevalent official policy of the
  British (except between 1763 and 1776) and then of the U.S. government was to promote
  agricultural and other settlement—to push the frontier westward as fast as physical
  and economic conditions permitted. The British crown’s grants of large, often vaguely
  specified tracts to individual proprietors or companies enabled the grantees to
  draw settlers by the sale or lease of land at attractive prices or even by outright
  gift.Of the numerous attempts at group colonization, the most notable effort was
  the theocratic and collectivist New England town that flourished, especially in
  Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire, during the first century of settlement.
  The town, the basic unit of government and comparable in area to townships in other
  states, allotted both rural and village parcels to single families by group decision.
  Contrary to earlier scholarly belief, in all but a few cases settlement was spatially
  dispersed in the socially cohesive towns, at least until about 1800. The relatively
  concentrated latter-day villages persist today as amoeba-like entities straggling
  along converging roads, neither fully rural nor agglomerated in form. The only latter-day
  settlement experiment of notable magnitude to achieve enduring success was a series
  of Mormon settlements in the Great Basin region of Utah and adjacent states, with
  their tightly concentrated farm villages reminiscent of the New England model. Other
  efforts have been made along ethnic, religious, or political lines, but success
  has been at best brief and fragile.Creating the national domainWith the coming of
  independence and after complex negotiations, the original 13 states surrendered
  to the new national government nearly all their claims to the unsettled western
  lands beyond their boundaries. Some tracts, however, were reserved for disposal
  to particular groups. Thus, the Western Reserve of northeastern Ohio gave preferential
  treatment to natives of Connecticut, while the military tracts in Ohio and Indiana
  were used as bonus payments to veterans of the American Revolution.A federally administered
  national domain was created, to which the great bulk of the territory acquired in
  1803 in the Louisiana Purchase and later beyond the Mississippi and in 1819 in Florida
  was consigned. The only major exceptions were the public lands of Texas, which were
  left within that state’s jurisdiction; such earlier French and Spanish land grants
  as were confirmed, often after tortuous litigation; and some Indian lands. In sharp
  contrast to the slipshod methods of colonial land survey and disposal, the federal
  land managers expeditiously surveyed, numbered, and mapped their territory in advance
  of settlement, beginning with Ohio in the 1780s, then sold or deeded it to settlers
  under inviting terms at a number of regional land offices.The design universally
  followed in the new survey system (except within the French, Spanish, and Indian
  grants) was a simple, efficient rectangular scheme. Townships were laid out as blocks,
  each six by six miles in size, oriented with the compass directions. Thirty-six
  sections, each one square mile, or 640 acres (260 hectares), in size, were designated
  within each township; and public roads were established along section lines and,
  where needed, along half-section lines. At irregular intervals, offsets in survey
  lines and roads were introduced to allow for the Earth’s curvature. Individual property
  lines were coincident with, or parallel to, survey lines, and this pervasive rectangularity
  generally carried over into the geometry of fields and fences or into the townsites
  later superimposed upon the basic rural survey.This all-encompassing checkerboard
  pattern is best appreciated from an airplane window over Iowa or Kansas. There,
  one sees few streams or other natural features and few diagonal highways or railroads
  interrupting the overwhelming squareness of the landscape. A systematic rectangular
  layout, rather less rigorous in form, also appears in much of Texas and in those
  portions of Maine, western New York and Pennsylvania, and southern Georgia that
  were settled after the 1780s.Distribution of rural landsSince its formation, Congress
  has enacted a series of complex schemes for distribution of the national domain.
  The most famous of these plans was the Homestead Act of 1862, which offered title
  to 160 acres to individual settlers, subject only to residence for a certain period
  of time and to the making of minimal improvements to the land thus acquired. The
  legal provisions of such acts have varied with time as the nature of farming technology
  and of the remaining lands have changed, but their general effect has been to perpetuate
  the Jeffersonian ideal of a republic in which yeoman farmers own and till self-sufficient
  properties.The program was successful in providing private owners with relatively
  choice lands, aside from parcels reserved for schools and various township and municipal
  uses. More than one-third of the national territory, however, is still owned by
  federal and state governments, with much of this land in forest and wildlife preserves.
  A large proportion of this land is in the West and is unsuited for intensive agriculture
  or grazing because of the roughness, dryness, or salinity of the terrain; much of
  it is leased out for light grazing or for timber cutting.Patterns of farm lifeDuring
  the classic period of American rural life, around 1900, the typical American lived
  or worked on a farm or was economically dependent upon farmers. In contrast to rural
  life in many other parts of the world, the farm family lived on an isolated farmstead
  some distance from town and often from farm neighbours; its property averaged less
  than one-quarter square mile. This farmstead varied in form and content with local
  tradition and economy. In particular, barn types were localized—for example, the
  tobacco barns of the South, the great dairy barns of Wisconsin, or the general-purpose
  forebay barns of southeastern Pennsylvania—as were modes of fencing. In general,
  however, the farmstead contained dwelling, barn, storage and sheds for small livestock
  and equipment, a small orchard, and a kitchen garden. A woodlot might be found in
  the least-accessible or least-fertile part of the farm.Successions of such farms
  were connected with one another and with the towns by means of a dense, usually
  rectangular lattice of roads, largely unimproved at the time. The hamlets, villages,
  and smaller cities were arrayed at relatively regular intervals, with size and affluence
  determined in large part by the presence and quality of rail service or status as
  the county seat. But, among people who have been historically rural, individualistic,
  and antiurban in bias, many services normally located in urban places might be found
  in rustic settings. Thus, much retail business was transacted by means of itinerant
  peddlers, while small shops for the fabrication, distribution, or repair of various
  items were often located in isolated farmsteads, as were many post offices.Social
  activity also tended to be widely dispersed among numerous rural churches, schools,
  or grange halls; and the climactic event of the year might well be the county fair,
  political rally, or religious encampment—again on a rural site. Not the least symptomatic
  sign of the strong tendency toward spatial isolation are the countless family burial
  plots or community cemeteries so liberally distributed across the countryside.Regional
  small-town patternsThere has been much regional variation among smaller villages
  and hamlets, but such phenomena have received relatively little attention from students
  of American culture or geography. The distinctive New England village, of course,
  is generally recognized and cherished: it consists of a loose clustering of white
  frame buildings, including a church (usually Congregationalist or Unitarian), town
  hall, shops, and stately homes with tall shade trees around the central green, or
  commons—a grassy expanse that may contain a bandstand and monuments or flowers.
  Derivative village forms were later carried westward to sections of the northern
  Midwest.Less widely known but equally distinctive is the town morphology characteristic
  of the Midland, or Pennsylvanian, culture area and most fully developed in southeastern
  and central Pennsylvania and Piedmont Maryland. It differs totally from the New
  England model in density, building materials, and general appearance. Closely packed,
  often contiguous buildings—mostly brick, but sometimes stone, frame, or stucco—abut
  directly on a sidewalk, which is often paved with brick and usually thickly planted
  with maple, sycamore, or other shade trees. Such towns are characteristically linear
  in plan, have dwellings intermingled with other types of buildings, have only one
  or two principal streets, and may radiate outward from a central square lined with
  commercial and governmental structures.Midwest States: History and PeopleEncyclopædia
  Britannica, Inc.The most characteristic U.S. small town is the one whose pattern
  evolved in the Midwest. Its simple scheme is usually based on the grid plan. Functions
  are rigidly segregated spatially, with the central business district, consisting
  of closely packed two- or three-story brick buildings, limited exclusively to commercial
  and administrative activity. The residences, generally set well back within spacious
  lots, are peripheral in location, as are most rail facilities, factories, and warehouses.Even
  the modest urbanization of the small town came late to the South. Most urban functions
  long were spatially dispersed—almost totally so in the early Chesapeake Bay country
  or North Carolina—or were performed entirely by the larger plantations dominating
  the economic life of much of the region. When city and town began to materialize
  in the 19th and 20th centuries, they tended to follow the Midwestern model in layout.Although
  quite limited in geographic area, the characteristic villages of the Mormon and
  Hispanic-American districts are of considerable interest. The Mormon settlement
  uncompromisingly followed the ecclesiastically imposed grid plan composed of square
  blocks, each with perhaps only four very large house lots, and the block surrounded
  by extremely wide streets. Those villages in New Mexico in which population and
  culture were derived from Old Mexico were often built according to the standard
  Latin-American plan. The distinctive feature is a central plaza dominated by a Roman
  Catholic church and encircled by low stone or adobe buildings.The rural–urban transitionWeakening
  of the agrarian idealThe United States has had little success in achieving or maintaining
  the ideal of the family farm. Through purchase, inheritance, leasing, and other
  means, some of dubious legality, smaller properties have been merged into much larger
  entities. By the late 1980s, for example, when the average farm size had surpassed
  460 acres, farms containing 2,000 or more acres accounted for almost half of all
  farmland and 20 percent of the cropland harvested, even though they comprised less
  than 3 percent of all farms. At the other extreme were those 60 percent of all farms
  that contained fewer than 180 acres and reported less than 15 percent of cropland
  harvested. This trend toward fewer but larger farms has continued.The huge, heavily
  capitalized “neoplantation,” essentially a factory in the field, is especially conspicuous
  in parts of California, Arizona, and the Mississippi Delta, but examples can be
  found in any state. There are also many smaller but intensive operations that call
  for large investments and advanced managerial skills. This trend toward large-scale,
  capital-intensive farm enterprise has been paralleled by a sharp drop in rural farm
  population—a slump from the all-time high of some 32,000,000 in the early 20th century
  to about 5,000,000 in the late 1980s; but even in 1940, when farm folk still numbered
  more than 30,000,000, nearly 40 percent of farm operators were tenants, and another
  10 percent were only partial owners.As the agrarian population has dwindled, so
  too has its immediate impact lessened, though less swiftly, in economic and political
  matters. The rural United States, however, has been the source of many of the nation’s
  values and images. The United States has become a highly urbanized, technologically
  advanced society far removed in daily life from cracker barrel, barnyard, corral,
  or logging camp. Although Americans have gravitated, sometimes reluctantly, to the
  big city, in the daydreams and assumptions that guide many sociopolitical decisions,
  the memory of a rapidly vanishing agrarian America is well noted. This is revealed
  not only in the works of contemporary novelists, poets, and painters but also throughout
  the popular arts: in movies, television, soap operas, folklore, country music, political
  oratory, and in much leisure activity.Impact of the motor vehicleSince about 1920
  more genuine change has occurred in American rural life than during the preceding
  three centuries of European settlement in North America. Although the basic explanation
  is the profound social and technological transformations engulfing most of the world,
  the most immediate agent of change has been the internal-combustion engine. The
  automobile, truck, bus, and paved highway have more than supplanted a moribund passenger
  and freight railroad system. While many local rail depots have been boarded up and
  scores of secondary lines have been abandoned, hundreds of thousands of miles of
  old dirt roads have been paved, and a vast system of interstate highways has been
  constructed to connect major cities in a single nonstop network. The net result
  has been a shrinking of travel time and an increase in miles traveled for the individual
  driver, rural or urban.Small towns in the United States have undergone a number
  of changes. Before 1970 towns near highways and urban centres generally prospered;
  while in the less-fortunate towns, where the residents lingered on for the sake
  of relatively cheap housing, downtown businesses often became extinct. From the
  late 1960s until about 1981 the rural and small-town population grew at a faster
  rate than the metropolitan population, the so-called metro–nonmetro turnaround,
  thus reversing more than a century of relatively greater urban growth. Subsequent
  evidence, however, suggests an approach toward equilibrium between the urban and
  rural sectors.As Americans have become increasingly mobile, the visual aspect of
  rural America has altered drastically. The highway has become the central route,
  and many of the functions once confined to the local town or city now stretch for
  many miles along major roads.Reversal of the classic rural dominanceThe metropolitanization
  of life in the United States has not been limited to city, suburb, or exurb; it
  now involves most of the rural area and population. The result has been the decline
  of local crafts and regional peculiarities, quite visibly in such items as farm
  implements, fencing, silos, and housing and in commodities such as clothing or bread.
  In many ways, the countryside is now economically dependent on the city.The city
  dweller is the dominant consumer for products other than those of field, quarry,
  or lumber mill; and city location tends to determine patterns of rural economy rather
  than the reverse. During weekends and the vacation seasons, swarms of city folk
  stream out to second homes in the countryside and to campgrounds, ski runs, beaches,
  boating areas, or hunting and fishing tracts. For many large rural areas, recreation
  is the principal source of income and employment; and such areas as northern New
  England and upstate New York have become playgrounds and sylvan refuges for many
  urban residents.The larger cities reach far into the countryside for their vital
  supplies of water and energy. There is an increasing reliance upon distant coalfields
  to provide fuel for electrical power plants, and cities have gone far afield in
  seeking out rural disposal sites for their ever-growing volumes of garbage.The majority
  of the rural population now lives within daily commuting range of a sizable city.
  This enables many farm residents to operate their farms while, at the same time,
  working part- or full-time at a city job, and it thus helps to prevent the drastic
  decline in rural population that has occurred in remoter parts of the country. Similarly,
  many small towns within the shadow of a metropolis, with fewer and fewer farmers
  to service, have become dormitory satellites, serving residents from nearby cities
  and suburbs.Urban settlementNortheast USA: History and PeopleEncyclopædia Britannica,
  Inc.The United States has moved from a predominantly rural settlement into an urban
  society. In so doing, it has followed the general path that other advanced nations
  have traveled and one along which developing nations have begun to hasten. About
  three-fourths of the population live clustered within officially designated urban
  places and urbanized areas, which account for less than 2 percent of the national
  territory. At least another 15 percent live in dispersed residences that are actually
  urban in economic or social orientation.Classic patterns of siting and growthAlthough
  more than 95 percent of the population was rural during the colonial period and
  for the first years of independence, cities were crucial elements in the settlement
  system from the earliest days. Boston; New Amsterdam (New York City); Jamestown,
  Va.; Charleston, S.C.; and Philadelphia were founded at the same time as the colonies
  they served. Like nearly all other North American colonial towns of consequence,
  they were ocean ports. Until at least the beginning of the 20th century the historical
  geography of U.S. cities was intimately related with that of successive transportation
  systems. The location of successful cities with respect to the areas they served,
  as well as their internal structure, was determined largely by the nature of these
  systems.The colonial cities acted as funnels for the collection and shipment of
  farm and forest products and other raw materials from the interior to trading partners
  in Europe, the Caribbean, or Africa and for the return flow of manufactured goods
  and other locally scarce items, as well as immigrants. Such cities were essentially
  marts and warehouses, and only minimal attention was given to social, military,
  educational, or religious functions. The inadequacy and high cost of overland traffic
  dictated sites along major ocean embayments or river estuaries; the only pre-1800
  nonports worthy of notice were Lancaster and York, both in Pennsylvania, and Williamsburg,
  Va. With the populating of the interior and the spread of a system of canals and
  improved roads, such new cities as Pittsburgh, Pa.; Cincinnati, Ohio; Buffalo, N.Y.;
  and St. Louis, Mo., mushroomed at junctures between various routes or at which modes
  of transport were changed. Older ocean ports, such as New Castle, Del.; Newport,
  R.I.; Charleston, S.C.; Savannah, Ga.; and Portland, Maine, whose locations prevented
  them from serving large hinterlands, tended to stagnate.From about 1850 to 1920
  the success of new cities and the further growth of older ones in large part were
  dependent on their location within the new steam railroad system and on their ability
  to dominate a large tributary territory. Such waterside rail hubs as Buffalo; Toledo,
  Ohio; Chicago; and San Francisco gained population and wealth rapidly, while such
  offspring of the rail era as Atlanta, Ga.; Indianapolis, Ind.; Minneapolis, Minn.;
  Fort Worth, Texas; and Tacoma, Wash., also grew dramatically. Much of the rapid
  industrialization of the 19th and early 20th centuries occurred in places already
  favoured by water or rail transport systems; but in some instances, such as in the
  cities of northeastern Pennsylvania’s anthracite region, some New England mill towns,
  and the textile centres of the Carolina and Virginia Piedmont, manufacturing brought
  about rapid urbanization and the consequent attraction of transport facilities.
  The extraction of gold, silver, copper, coal, iron, and, in the 20th century, gas
  and oil led to rather ephemeral centres—unless these places were able to capitalize
  on local or regional advantages other than minerals.A strong early start, whatever
  the inital economic base may have been, was often the key factor in competition
  among cities. With sufficient early momentum, urban capital and population tended
  to expand almost automatically. The point is illustrated perfectly by the larger
  cities of the northeastern seaboard, from Portland, Maine, through Baltimore, Md.
  The nearby physical wealth is poor to mediocre, and they are now far off-centre
  on the national map; but a prosperous mercantile beginning, good land and sea connections
  with distant places, and a rich local accumulation of talent, capital, and initiative
  were sufficient to bring about the growth of one of the world’s largest concentrations
  of industry, commerce, and people.New factors in municipal developmentThe pre-1900
  development of the American city was almost completely a chronicle of the economics
  of the production, collection, and distribution of physical commodities and basic
  services dictated by geography, but there have been striking deviations from this
  pattern. The physical determinants of urban location and growth have given way to
  social factors. Increasingly, the most successful cities are oriented toward the
  more advanced modes for the production and consumption of services, specifically
  the knowledge, managerial, and recreational industries. The largest cities have
  become more dependent upon corporate headquarters, communications, and the manipulation
  of information for their sustenance. Washington, D.C., is the most obvious example
  of a metropolis in which government and ancillary activities have been the spur
  for vigorous growth; but almost all of the state capitals have displayed a similar
  demographic and economic vitality. Further, urban centres that contain a major college
  or university often have enjoyed remarkable expansion.With the coming of relative
  affluence and abundant leisure to the population and a decrease of labour input
  in industrial processes, a new breed of cities has sprouted across the land: those
  that cater to the pleasure-seeker, vacationer, and the retired—for example, the
  young, flourishing cities of Florida or Nevada and many locations in California,
  Arizona, and Colorado.The automobile as a means of personal transportation was developed
  about the time of World War I, and the American city was catapulted into a radically
  new period, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the further evolution of physical
  form and function. The size, density, and internal structure of the city were previously
  constrained by the limitations of the pedestrian and early mass-transit systems.
  Only the well-to-do could afford horse and carriage or a secluded villa in the countryside.
  Cities were relatively small and compact, with a single clearly defined centre,
  and they grew by accretion along their edges, without any significant spatial hiatuses
  except where commuter railroads linked outlying towns to the largest of metropolises.
  Workers living beyond the immediate vicinity of their work had to locate within
  reach of the few horse-drawn omnibuses or the later electric street railways.The
  universality of the automobile, even among the less affluent, and the parallel proliferation
  of service facilities and highways greatly loosened and fragmented the American
  city, which spread over surrounding rural lands. Older, formerly autonomous towns
  grew swiftly. Many towns became satellites of the larger city or were absorbed.
  Many suburbs and subdivisions arose with single-family homes on lots larger than
  had been possible for the ordinary householder in the city. These communities were
  almost totally dependent on the highway for the flow of commuters, goods, and services,
  and many were located in splendid isolation, separated by tracts of farmland, brush,
  or forest from other such developments. At the major interchanges of the limited-access
  highways, a new form of agglomerated settlement sprang up. In a further elaboration
  of this trend, many larger cities have been girdled by a set of mushrooming complexes.
  These creations of private enterprise embody a novel concept of urban existence:
  a metropolitan module no longer reliant on the central city or its downtown. Usually
  anchored on a cluster of shopping malls and office parks, these “hypersuburbs,”
  whose residents and employees circulate freely within the outer metropolitan ring,
  offer virtually all of the social and economic facilities needed for the modern
  life-style.The new look of the metropolitan areaThe outcome has been a broad, ragged,
  semiurbanized belt of land surrounding each city, large or small, and quite often
  blending imperceptibly into the suburban-exurban halo encircling a neighbouring
  metropolitan centre. There is a great similarity in the makeup and general appearance
  of all such tracts: the planless intermixture of scraps of the rural landscape with
  the fragments of the scattered metropolis; the randomly distributed subdivisions
  or single homes; the vast shopping centres, the large commercial cemeteries, drive-in
  theatres, junkyards, and golf courses and other recreational enterprises; and the
  regional or metropolitan airport, often with its own cluster of factories, warehouses,
  or travel-oriented businesses. The traditional city—unitary, concentric in form,
  with a single well-defined middle—has been replaced by a relatively amorphous, polycentric
  metropolitan sprawl.The inner city of a large U.S. metropolitan area displays some
  traits that are common to the larger centres of all advanced nations. A central
  business district, almost always the oldest section of the city, is surrounded by
  a succession of roughly circular zones, each distinctive in economic and social-ethnic
  character. The symmetry of this scheme is distorted by the irregularities of surface
  and drainage or the effects of radial highways and railroads. Land is most costly,
  and hence land use is most intensive, toward the centre. Major business, financial
  and governmental offices, department stores, and specialty shops dominate the downtown,
  which is usually fringed by a band of factories and warehouses. The outer parts
  of the city, like the suburbs, are mainly residential.With some exceptions—e.g.,
  large apartment complexes in downtown Chicago—people do not reside in the downtown
  areas, and there is a steady downward gradient in population density per unit area
  (and more open land and single-family residences) as one moves from the inner city
  toward the open country. Conversely, there is a general rise in income and social
  status with increasing distance from the core. The sharply defined immigrant neighbourhoods
  of the 19th century generally persist in a somewhat diluted form, though specific
  ethnic groups may have shifted their location. Later migrant groups, notably Southern
  blacks and Latin Americans, generally dominate the more run-down neighbourhoods
  of the inner cities.Individual and collective character of citiesAmerican cities,
  more so than the small-town or agrarian landscape, tend to be the product of a particular
  period rather than of location. The relatively venerable centres of the Eastern
  Seaboard—Boston; Philadelphia; Baltimore, Md.; Albany, N.Y.; Chester, Pa.; Alexandria,
  Va.; or Georgetown (a district of Washington, D.C.), for example—are virtual replicas
  of the fashionable European models of their early period rather than the fruition
  of a regional culture, unlike New Orleans and Santa Fe, N.M., which reflect other
  times and regions. The townscapes of Pittsburgh; Detroit, Mich.; Chicago; and Denver,
  Colo., depict national modes of thought and the technological development of their
  formative years, just as Dallas, Texas; Las Vegas, Nev.; San Diego, Calif.; Tucson,
  Ariz.; and Albuquerque, N.M., proclaim contemporary values and gadgetry more than
  any local distinctiveness. When strong-minded city founders instituted a highly
  individual plan and their successors managed to preserve it—as, for example, in
  Savannah, Ga.; Washington, D.C.; and Salt Lake City, Utah—or when there is a happy
  combination of a spectacular site and appreciative residents—as in San Francisco
  or Seattle, Wash.—a genuine individuality does seem to emerge. Such an identity
  also may develop where immigration has been highly selective, as in such places
  as Miami, Fla.; Phoenix, Ariz.; and Los Angeles.As a group, U.S. cities differ from
  cities in other countries in both type and degree. The national political structure,
  the social inclinations of the people, and the strong outward surge of urban development
  have led to the political fragmentation of metropolises that socially and economically
  are relatively cohesive units. The fact that a single metropolitan area may sprawl
  across numerous incorporated towns and cities, several townships, and two or more
  counties and states has a major impact upon both its appearance and the way it functions.
  Not the least of these effects is a dearth of overall physical and social planning
  (or its ineffectuality when attempted), and the rather chaotic, inharmonious appearance
  of both inner-city and peripheral zones painfully reflects the absence of any effective
  collective action concerning such matters.The American city is a place of sharp
  transitions. Construction, demolition, and reconstruction go on almost ceaselessly,
  though increasing thought has been given to preserving monuments and buildings.
  From present evidence, it would be impossible to guess that New York City and Albany
  date from the 1620s or that Detroit was founded in 1701. Preservation and restoration
  do occur, but often only when it makes sense in terms of tourist revenue. Physical
  and social blight has reached epidemic proportions in the slum areas of the inner
  city; but, despite the wholesale razing of such areas and the subsequent urban-renewal
  projects (sometimes as apartment or commercial developments for the affluent), the
  belief has become widespread that the ills of the U.S. city are incurable, especially
  with the increasing flight of capital, tax revenue, and the more highly educated,
  affluent elements of the population to suburban areas and the spatial and political
  polarization of whites and nonwhites.In the central sections of U.S. cities, there
  is little sense of history or continuity; instead, one finds evidence of the dominance
  of the engineering mentality and of the credo that the business of the city is business.
  Commercial and administrative activities are paramount, and usually there is little
  room for church buildings or for parks or other nonprofit enterprises. The role
  of the cathedral, so central in the medieval European city, is filled by a U.S.
  invention serving both utilitarian and symbolic purposes, the skyscraper. Some cities
  have felt the need for other bold secular monuments; hence the Gateway Arch looming
  over St. Louis, Seattle’s Space Needle, and Houston’s Astrodome. Future archaeologists
  may well conclude from their excavations that American society was ruled by an oligarchy
  of highway engineers, architects, and bulldozer operators. The great expressways
  converging upon, or looping, the downtown area and the huge amount of space devoted
  to parking lots and garages are even more impressive than the massive surgery executed
  upon U.S. cities a century ago to hack out room for railroad terminals and marshaling
  yards.Within many urban sites there has been radical physical transformation of
  shoreline, drainage systems, and land surface that would be difficult to match elsewhere
  in the world. Thus, in their physical lineaments, Manhattan and inner Boston bear
  scant resemblance to the landscapes seen by their initial settlers. The surface
  of downtown Chicago has been raised several feet above its former swamp level, the
  city’s lakefront extensively reshaped, and the flow of the Chicago River reversed.
  Los Angeles, notorious for its disregard of the environment, has its concrete arroyo
  bottoms, terraced hillsides and landslides, and its own artificial microclimate.The
  supercitiesThe unprecedented outward sprawl of American urban settlement has created
  some novel settlement forms, for the quantitative change has been so great as to
  induce qualitative transformation. The conurbation—a territorial coalescence of
  two or more sizable cities whose peripheral zones have grown together—may have first
  appeared in early 19th-century Europe. There are major examples in Great Britain,
  the Low Countries, and Germany, as well as in Japan.Nothing elsewhere, however,
  rivals in size and complexity the aptly named megalopolis, that supercity stretching
  along the Atlantic from Portland, Maine, past Richmond, Va. Other large conurbations
  include, in the Great Lakes region, one centred on Chicago and containing large
  slices of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Indiana; another based in Detroit, embracing
  large parts of Michigan and Ohio and reaching into Canada; and a third stretching
  from Buffalo through Cleveland and back to Pittsburgh. All three are reaching toward
  one another and may form another megalopolis that, in turn, may soon be grafted
  onto the seaboard megalopolis by a corridor through central New York state.Another
  example of a growing megalopolis is the huge southern California conurbation reaching
  from Santa Barbara, through a dominating Los Angeles, to the Mexican border. The
  solid strip of urban territory that lines the eastern shore of Puget Sound is a
  smaller counterpart. Quite exceptional in form is the slender linear multicity occupying
  Florida’s Atlantic coastline, from Jacksonville to Miami, and the loose swarm of
  medium-sized cities clustering along the Southern Piedmont, from south-central Virginia
  to Birmingham, Ala.; also of note are the Texas cities of Dallas–Fort Worth, Houston,
  and San Antonio, which have formed a rapidly growing—though discontinuous—urbanized
  triangle.One of the few predictions that seem safe in so dynamic and innovative
  a land as the United States is that, unless severe and painful controls are placed
  on land use, the shape of the urban environment will be increasingly megalopolitan:
  a small set of great constellations of polycentric urban zones, each complexly interlocked
  socially and physically with its neighbours.Traditional regions of the United StatesThe
  differences among America’s traditional regions, or culture areas, tend to be slight
  and shallow as compared with such areas in most older, more stable countries. The
  muted, often subtle nature of interregional differences can be ascribed to the relative
  newness of American settlement, a perpetually high degree of mobility, a superb
  communications system, and the galloping centralization of economy and government.
  It might even be argued that some of these regions are quaint vestiges of a vanishing
  past, of interest only to antiquarians.Yet, in spite of the nationwide standardization
  in many areas of American thought and behaviour, the lingering effects of the older
  culture areas do remain potent. In the case of the South, for example, the differences
  helped to precipitate the gravest political crisis and bloodiest military conflict
  in the nation’s history. More than a century after the Civil War, the South remains
  a powerful entity in political, economic, and social terms, and its peculiar status
  is recognized in religious, educational, athletic, and literary circles.Even more
  intriguing is the appearance of a series of essentially 20th-century regions. Southern
  California is the largest and perhaps the most distinctive region, and its special
  culture has attracted large numbers of immigrants to the state. Similar trends are
  visible in southern Florida; in Texas, whose mystique has captured the national
  imagination; and to a certain degree in the more ebullient regions of New Mexico
  and Arizona as well. At the metropolitan level, it is difficult to believe that
  such distinctive cities as San Francisco, Las Vegas, Dallas, Tucson, and Seattle
  have become like all other American cities. A detailed examination, however, would
  show significant if sometimes subtle interregional differences in terms of language,
  religion, diet, folklore, folk architecture and handicrafts, political behaviour,
  social etiquette, and a number of other cultural categories.The hierarchy of culture
  areasA multitiered hierarchy of culture areas might be postulated for the United
  States; but the most interesting levels are, first, the nation as a whole and, second,
  the five to 10 large subnational regions, each embracing several states or major
  portions thereof. There is a remarkably close coincidence between the political
  United States and the cultural United States. Crossing into Mexico, the traveler
  passes across a cultural chasm. If the contrasts are less dramatic between the two
  sides of the U.S.-Canadian boundary, they are nonetheless real, especially to the
  Canadian. Erosion of the cultural barrier has been largely limited to the area that
  stretches from northern New York state to Aroostook county, Maine. There, a vigorous
  demographic and cultural immigration by French-Canadians has gone far toward eradicating
  international differences.While the international boundaries act as a cultural container,
  the interstate boundaries are curiously irrelevant. Even when the state had a strong
  autonomous early existence—as happened with Massachusetts, Virginia, or Pennsylvania—subsequent
  economic and political forces have tended to wash away such initial identities.
  Actually, it could be argued that the political divisions of the 48 coterminous
  states are anachronistic in the context of contemporary socioeconomic and cultural
  forces. Partially convincing cases might be built for equating Utah and Texas with
  their respective culture areas because of exceptional historical and physical circumstances,
  or perhaps Oklahoma, given its very late European occupation and its dubious distinction
  as the territory to which exiled Indian tribes of the East were relegated. In most
  instances, however, the states either contain two or more distinctly different culture
  and political areas or fragments thereof or are part of a much larger single culture
  area. Thus sharp North–South dichotomies characterize California, Missouri, Illinois,
  Indiana, Ohio, and Florida, while Tennessee advertises that there are really three
  Tennessees. In Virginia the opposing cultural forces were so strong that actual
  fission took place in 1863 (with the admission to the Union of West Virginia) along
  one of those rare interstate boundaries that approximate a genuine cultural divide.Much
  remains to be learned about the cause and effect relations between economic and
  culture areas in the United States. If the South or New England could at one time
  be correlated with a specific economic system, this is no longer easy to do. Cultural
  systems appear to respond more slowly to agents of change than do economic or urban
  systems. Thus the Manufacturing Belt, a core region for many social and economic
  activities, now spans parts of four traditional culture areas—New England, the Midland,
  the Midwest, and the northern fringes of the South. The great urban sprawl, from
  southern Maine to central Virginia, blithely ignores the cultural slopes that are
  still visible in its more rural tracts.The cultural hearthsThe culture areas of
  the United States are generally European in origin, the result of importing European
  colonists and ways of life and the subsequent adaptation of social groups to new
  habitats. The aboriginal cultures have had relatively little influence on the nation’s
  modern culture. In the Southwestern and the indistinct Oklahoman subregions, the
  Indian element merits consideration only as one of several ingredients making up
  the regional mosaic. With some exceptions, the map of American culture areas in
  the East can be explained in terms of the genesis, development, and expansion of
  the three principal colonial cultural hearths along the Atlantic seaboard. Each
  was basically British in character, but their personalities remain distinct because
  of, first, different sets of social and political conditions during the critical
  period of first effective settlement and, second, local physical and economic circumstances.
  The cultural gradients between them tend to be much steeper and the boundaries more
  distinct than is true for the remainder of the nation.New EnglandUnited States:
  New EnglandEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.New England was the dominant region during
  the century of rapid expansion following the American Revolution and not merely
  in terms of demographic or economic expansion. In social and cultural life—in education,
  politics, theology, literature, science, architecture, and the more advanced forms
  of mechanical and social technology—the area exercised its primacy. New England
  was the leading source of ideas and styles for the nation from about 1780 to 1880;
  it furnishes an impressive example of the capacity of strongly motivated communities
  to rise above the constraints of a harsh environment.During its first two centuries,
  New England had an unusually homogeneous population. With some exceptions, the British
  immigrants shared the same nonconformist religious beliefs, language, social organization,
  and general outlook. A distinctive regional culture took form, most noticeably in
  terms of dialect, town morphology, and folk architecture. The personality of the
  people also took on a regional coloration both in folklore and in actuality; there
  is sound basis for the belief that the traditional New England Yankee is self-reliant,
  thrifty, inventive, and enterprising. The influx of immigrants that began in the
  1830s diluted and altered the New England identity, but much of its early personality
  survived.By virtue of location, wealth, and seniority, the Boston metropolitan area
  has become the cultural economic centre of New England. This sovereignty is shared
  to some degree, however, with two other old centres, the lower Connecticut Valley
  and the Narragansett Bay region of Rhode Island.The early westward demographic and
  ideological expansion of New England was so influential that it is justifiable to
  call New York, northern New Jersey, northern Pennsylvania, and much of the Upper
  Midwest “New England Extended.” Further, the energetic endeavours of New England
  whalers, merchants, and missionaries had a considerable impact on the cultures of
  Hawaii, various other Pacific isles, and several points in the Caribbean. New Englanders
  also were active in the Americanization of early Oregon and Washington, with results
  that are still visible. Later, the overland diffusion of New England natives and
  practices meant a recognizable New England character not only for the Upper Midwest,
  from Ohio to the Dakotas, but also in the Pacific Northwest in general, though to
  a lesser degree.The SouthUnited States: The Upper SouthEncyclopædia Britannica,
  Inc.By far the largest of the three original Anglo-American culture areas, the South
  is also the most idiosyncratic with respect to national norms—or slowest to accept
  them. The South was once so distinct from the non-South in almost every observable
  or quantifiable feature and so fiercely proud of its peculiarities that for some
  years the question of whether it could maintain political and social unity with
  the non-South was in serious doubt. These differences are still observable in almost
  every realm of human activity, including rural economy, dialect, diet, costume,
  folklore, politics, architecture, social customs, and recreation. Only during the
  20th century can an argument be made that it has achieved a decisive convergence
  with the rest of the nation, at least in terms of economic behaviour and material
  culture.A persistent deviation from the national mainstream probably began in the
  first years of settlement. The first settlers of the South were almost purely British,
  not outwardly different from those who flocked to New England or the Midland, but
  almost certainly distinct in terms of motives and social values and more conservative
  in retaining the rurality and the family and social structure of premodern Europe.
  The vast importation of African slaves was also a major factor, as was a degree
  of contact with the Indians that was less pronounced farther north. In addition,
  the unusual pattern of economy (much different from that of northwestern Europe),
  settlement, and social organization, which were in part an adaptation to a starkly
  unfamiliar physical habitat, accentuated the South’s deviation from other culture
  areas.In both origin and spatial structure, the South has been characterized by
  diffuseness. In the search for a single cultural hearth, the most plausible choice
  is the Chesapeake Bay area and the northeastern corner of North Carolina, the earliest
  area of recognizably Southern character. Early components of Southern population
  and culture also arrived from other sources. A narrow coastal strip from North Carolina
  to the Georgia–Florida border and including the Sea Islands is decidedly Southern
  in character, yet it stands apart self-consciously from other parts of the South.
  Though colonized directly from Great Britain, it had also significant connections
  with the West Indies, in which relation the African cultural contribution was strongest
  and purest. Charleston and Savannah, which nurtured their own distinctive civilizations,
  dominated this subregion. Similarly, French Louisiana received elements of culture
  and population—to be stirred into the special Creole mixture—not only, putatively,
  from the Chesapeake Bay hearth area but also indirectly from France, French Nova
  Scotia, the French West Indies, and Africa. In south central Texas, the Germanic
  and Hispanic influx was so heavy that a special subregion can be designated.It would
  seem, then, that the Southern culture area may be an example of convergent, or parallel,
  evolution of a variety of elements arriving along several paths but subject to some
  single general process that could mold one larger regional consciousness and way
  of life.Because of its slowness in joining the national technological mainstream,
  the South can be subdivided into a much greater number of subregions than is possible
  for any of the other older traditional regions. Those described above are of lesser
  order than the two principal Souths, variously called Upper and Lower (or Deep)
  South, Upland and Lowland South, or Yeoman and Plantation South.The Upland South,
  which comprises the southern Appalachians, the upper Appalachian Piedmont, the Cumberland
  and other low interior plateaus, and the Ozarks and Ouachitas, was colonized culturally
  and demographically from the Chesapeake Bay hearth area and the Midland; it is most
  emphatically white Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) in character. The latter area,
  which contains a large black population, includes the greater part of the South
  Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains and the lower Appalachian Piedmont. Its early major
  influences came from the Chesapeake Bay area, with only minor elements from the
  coastal Carolina–Georgia belt, Louisiana, and elsewhere. The division between the
  two subregions remains distinct from Virginia to Texas, but each region can be further
  subdivided. Within the Upland South, the Ozark region might legitimately be detached
  from the Appalachian; and, within the latter, the proud and prosperous Kentucky
  Bluegrass, with its emphasis on tobacco and Thoroughbreds, certainly merits special
  recognition.Toward the margins of the South, the difficulties in delimiting subregions
  become greater. The outer limits themselves are a topic of special interest. There
  seems to be more than an accidental relation between these limits and various climatic
  factors. The fuzzy northern boundary, definitely not associated with the conventional
  Mason and Dixon Line or the Ohio River, seems most closely associated with length
  of frost-free season or with temperature during the winter. As the Southern cultural
  complex was carried to the West, it not only retained its strength but became more
  intense, in contrast to the influence of New England and the Midland. But the South
  finally fades away as one approaches the 100th meridian, with its critical decline
  in annual precipitation. The apparent correlation between the cultural South and
  a humid subtropical climatic regime is in many ways valid.The Texas subregion is
  so large, distinctive, vigorous, and self-assertive that it presents some vexing
  classificatory questions. Is Texas simply a subregion of the Greater South, or has
  it acquired so strong and divergent an identity that it can be regarded as a major
  region in its own right? It is likely that a major region has been born in a frontier
  zone in which several distinct cultural communities confront one another and in
  which the mixture has bred the vigorous, extroverted, aggressive Texas personality
  so widely celebrated in song and story. Similarly, peninsular Florida may be considered
  either within or juxtaposed to the South but not necessarily part of it. In the
  case of Florida, an almost empty territory began to receive significant settlement
  only after about 1890, and if, like Texas, most of it came from the older South,
  there were also vigorous infusions from elsewhere.The MidlandUnited States: Middle
  Atlantic regionEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The significance of this region has
  not been less than that of New England or the South, but its characteristics are
  the least conspicuous to outsiders as well as to its own residents—reflecting, perhaps,
  its centrality in the course of U.S. development. The Midland (a term not to be
  confused with Midwest) comprises portions of Middle Atlantic and Upper Southern
  states: Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland. Serious European settlement
  of the Midland began a generation or more after that of the other major cultural
  centres and after several earlier, relatively ineffectual trials by the Dutch, Swedes,
  Finns, and British. But once begun late in the 17th century by William Penn and
  his associates, the colonization of the area was a success. Within southeastern
  Pennsylvania this culture area first assumed its distinctive character: a prosperous,
  sober, industrious agricultural society that quickly became a mixed economy as mercantile
  and later industrial functions came to the fore. By the mid-18th century much of
  the region had acquired a markedly urban character, resembling in many ways the
  more advanced portions of the North Sea countries. In this respect, at least, the
  Midland was well ahead of neighbouring areas to the north and south.It differed
  also in its polyglot ethnicity. From almost the beginning, the various ethnic and
  religious groups of the British Isles were joined by immigrants from the European
  mainland. This diversity has grown and is likely to continue. The mosaic of colonial
  ethnic groups has persisted in much of Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and Maryland,
  as has the remarkable variety of nationalities and churches in coalfields, company
  towns, cities, and many rural areas. Much of the same ethnic heterogeneity can be
  seen in New England, the Midwest, and a few other areas, but the Midland stands
  out as perhaps the most polyglot region of the nation. The Germanic element has
  always been notably strong, if irregularly distributed, in the Midland, accounting
  for more than 70 percent of the population of many towns. Had the Anglo-American
  culture not triumphed, the area might well have been designated Pennsylvania German.Physiography
  and migration carried the Midland culture area into the Maryland Piedmont. Although
  its width tapers quickly below the Potomac, it reaches into parts of Virginia and
  West Virginia, with traces legible far down the Appalachian zone and into the South.The
  northern half of the greater Midland region (the New York subregion, or New England
  Extended) cannot be assigned unequivocally to either New England or this Midland.
  Essentially it is a hybrid formed mainly from two regional strains of almost equal
  strength: New England and the post-1660 British element moving up the Hudson valley
  and beyond. There has also been a persistent, if slight, residue of early Dutch
  culture and some subtle filtering northward of Pennsylvanian influences. Apparently
  within the New York subregion occurred the first major fusion of American regional
  cultures, especially within the early 19th-century “Burned-Over District,” around
  the Finger Lakes and Genesee areas of central and western New York. This locality,
  the seedbed for a number of important social innovations, was a major staging area
  for westward migration and possibly a major source for the people and notions that
  were to build the Midwestern culture area.Toward the west the Midland retains its
  integrity for only a short distance—certainly no further than eastern Ohio—as it
  becomes submerged within the Midwest. Still, its significance in the genesis of
  the Midwest and the national culture should not be minimized. Its success in projecting
  its image upon so much of the country may have drawn attention away from the source
  area. As both name and location suggest, the Midland is intermediate in character
  in many respects, lying between New England and the South. Its residents are much
  less concerned with, or conscious of, a strong regional identity (excepting the
  Pennsylvania Dutch caricatures) than is true for the other regions, and, in addition,
  the Midland lacks their strong political and literary traditions, though it is unmistakable
  in its distinctive townscapes and farmsteads.The newer culture areasThe MidwestUnited
  States: The MidwestEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc. There is no such self-effacement
  in the Midwest, that large triangular region justly regarded as the most nearly
  representative of the national average. Everyone within or outside of the Midwest
  knows of its existence, but no one is certain where it begins or ends. The older
  apex of the eastward-pointing triangle appears to rest around Pittsburgh, while
  the two western corners melt away somewhere in the Great Plains, possibly in southern
  Manitoba in the north and southern Kansas in the south. The eastern terminus and
  the southern and western borders are broad, indistinct transitional zones.Serious
  study of the historical geography of the Midwest began only in the 20th century,
  but it seems likely that this culture region was the combination of all three colonial
  regions and that this combination first took place in the upper Ohio valley. The
  early routes of travel—the Ohio and its tributaries, the Great Lakes, and the low,
  level corridor along the Mohawk and the coastal plains of Lake Ontario and Lake
  Erie—converge upon Ohio. There, the people and cultural traits from New England,
  the Midland, and the South were first funneled together. There seems to have been
  a fanlike widening of the new hybrid area into the West as settlers worked their
  way frontierward.Two major subregions are readily discerned, the Upper and Lower
  Midwest. They are separated by a line, roughly approximating the 41st parallel,
  that persists as far west as Colorado in terms of speech patterns and indicates
  differences in regional provenance in ethnic and religious terms as well. Much of
  the Upper Midwest retains a faint New England character, although Midland influences
  are probably as important. A rich mixture of German, Scandinavian, Slavic, and other
  non-WASP elements has greatly diversified a stock in which the British element usually
  remains dominant and the range of church denominations is great. The Lower Midwest,
  except for the relative scarcity of blacks, tends to resemble the South in its predominantly
  Protestant and British makeup. There are some areas with sizable Roman Catholic
  and non-WASP populations, but on the whole the subregion tends to be more WASP in
  inclination than most other parts of the nation.The problem of “the West”Mountain
  Region: History and PeopleEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The foregoing culture areas
  account for roughly the eastern half of the coterminous United States. There is
  a dilemma in classifying the remaining half. The concept of the American West, strong
  in the popular imagination, is reinforced constantly by romanticized cinematic and
  television images of the cowboy. It is facile to accept the widespread Western livestock
  complex as epitomizing the full gamut of Western life, because although the cattle
  industry may have once accounted for more than one-half of the active Western domain
  as measured in acres, it employed only a relatively small fraction of the total
  population. As a single subculture, it cannot represent the total regional culture.It
  is not clear whether there is a genuine, single, grand Western culture region. Unlike
  the East, where virtually all the land is developed and culture areas and subregions
  abut and overlap in splendid confusion, the eight major and many lesser nodes of
  population in the western United States resemble oases, separated from one another
  by wide expanses of nearly unpopulated mountain or arid desert. The only obvious
  properties these isolated clusters have in common are, first, the intermixture of
  several strains of culture, primarily from the East but with additions from Europe,
  Mexico, and East Asia, and, second, except for one subregion, a general modernity,
  having been settled in a serious way no earlier than the 1840s. Some areas may be
  viewed as inchoate, or partially formed, cultural entities; the others have acquired
  definite personalities but are difficult to classify as first-order or lesser order
  culture areas.There are several major tracts in the western United States that reveal
  a genuine cultural identity: the Upper Rio Grande region, the Mormon region, southern
  California, and, by some accounts, northern California. To this group one might
  add the anomalous Texan and Oklahoman subregions, which have elements of both the
  West and the South.United States: The SouthwestEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The
  term Upper Rio Grande region was coined to denote the oldest and strongest of the
  three sectors of Hispanic-American activity in the Southwest, the others being southern
  California and portions of Texas. Although covering the valley of the upper Rio
  Grande, the region also embraces segments of Arizona and Colorado as well as other
  parts of New Mexico. European communities and culture have been present there, with
  only one interruption, since the late 16th century. The initial sources were Spain
  and Mexico, but after 1848 at least three distinct strains of Anglo-American culture
  were increasingly well represented—the Southern, Mormon, and a general undifferentiated
  Northeastern culture—plus a distinct Texan subcategory. For once this has occurred
  without obliterating the Indians, whose culture endures in various stages of dilution,
  from the strongly Americanized or Hispanicized to the almost undisturbed.The general
  mosaic is a fabric of Indian, Anglo, and Hispanic elements, and all three major
  groups, furthermore, are complex in character. The Indian component is made up of
  Navajo, Pueblo, and several smaller groups, each of which is quite distinct from
  the others. The Hispanic element is also diverse—modally Mexican mestizo, but ranging
  from pure Spanish to nearly pure pre-Spanish aboriginal.United States: The northern
  Mountain regionEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The Mormon region is expansive in the
  religious and demographic realms, though it has ceased to expand territorially as
  it did in the decades after the first settlement in the Salt Lake valley in 1847.
  Despite its Great Basin location and an exemplary adaptation to environmental constraints,
  this cultural complex appears somewhat non-Western in spirit: the Mormons may be
  in the West, but they are not entirely of it. Their historical derivation from the
  Midwest and from ultimate sources in New York and New England is still apparent,
  along with the generous admixture of European converts to their religion.As in New
  England, the power of the human will and an intensely cherished abstract design
  have triumphed over an unfriendly habitat. The Mormon way of life is expressed in
  the settlement landscape and economic activities within a region more homogeneous
  internally than any other U.S. culture area.CaliforniaEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.In
  contrast, northern California has yet to gain its own strong cultural coloration.
  From the beginning of the great 1849 gold rush the area drew a diverse population
  from Europe and Asia as well as the older portions of the United States. Whether
  the greater part of northern California has produced a culture amounting to more
  than the sum of the contributions brought by immigrants is questionable. San Francisco,
  the regional metropolis, may have crossed the qualitative threshold. An unusually
  cosmopolitan outlook that includes an awareness of the Orient stronger than that
  of any other U.S. city, a fierce self-esteem, and a unique townscape may be symptomatic
  of a genuinely new, emergent local culture.Southern California is the most spectacular
  of the Western regions, not only in terms of economic and population growth but
  also for the luxuriance, regional particularism, and general avant-garde character
  of its swiftly evolving cultural pattern. Until the coming of a direct transcontinental
  rail connection in 1885, the region was remote, rural, and largely inconsequential.
  Since then, the invasion by persons from virtually every corner of North America
  and by the world has been massive, but since the 1960s in-migration has slackened
  perceptibly, and many residents have begun to question the doctrine of unlimited
  growth. In any event, a loosely articulated series of urban and suburban developments
  continue to encroach upon what little is left of arable or habitable land in the
  Coast Ranges and valleys from Santa Barbara to the Mexican border.Although every
  major ethnic and racial group and every other U.S. culture area is amply represented
  in southern California, there is reason to suspect that a process of selection for
  certain types of people, attitudes, and personality traits may have been at work
  at both source and destination. The region is distinct from, or perhaps in the vanguard
  of, the remainder of the nation. One might view southern California as the super-American
  region or the outpost of a postindustrial future, but its cultural distinctiveness
  is very evident in landscape and social behaviour. Southern California in no way
  approaches being a “traditional region,” or even the smudged facsimile of such,
  but rather the largest, boldest experiment in creating a “voluntary region,” one
  built through the self-selection of immigrants and their subsequent interaction.United
  States: The northern Pacific CoastEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The remaining identifiable
  Western regions—the Willamette valley of Oregon, the Puget Sound region, the Inland
  Empire of eastern Washington and adjacent tracts of Idaho and Oregon, central Arizona,
  and the Colorado Piedmont—can be treated jointly as potential, or emergent, culture
  areas, still too close to the national mean to display any cultural distinctiveness.
  In all of these regions is evident the arrival of a cross section of the national
  population and the growth of regional life around one or more major metropolises.
  A New England element is noteworthy in the Willamette valley and Puget Sound regions,
  while a Hispanic-American component appears in the Colorado Piedmont and central
  Arizona. Only time and further study will reveal whether any of these regions, so
  distant from the historic sources of U.S. population and culture, have the capacity
  to become an independent cultural area.Wilbur Zelinsky\r\n"

      United States, officially United States of America, abbreviations U.S. or U.S.A., byname America, 
- "    country of North America, a federal republic of 50 states. Besides the 48 contiguous
  states that occupy the middle latitudes of the continent, the United States includes
  the state of Alaska, at the northwestern extreme of North America, and the island
  state of Hawaii, in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The coterminous states are bounded on
  the north by Canada, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the Gulf
  of Mexico and Mexico, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. The United States is
  the fourth largest country in the world in area (after Russia, Canada, and China).
  The national capital is Washington, which is coextensive with the District of Columbia,
  the federal capital region created in 1790.The major characteristic of the United
  States is probably its great variety. Its physical environment ranges from the Arctic
  to the subtropical, from the moist rain forest to the arid desert, from the rugged
  mountain peak to the flat prairie. Although the total population of the United States
  is large by world standards, its overall population density is relatively low; the
  country embraces some of the world’s largest urban concentrations as well as some
  of the most extensive areas that are almost devoid of habitation.The United States
  contains a highly diverse population. Unlike a country such as China that largely
  incorporated indigenous peoples, the United States has a diversity that to a great
  degree has come from an immense and sustained global immigration. Probably no other
  country has a wider range of racial, ethnic, and cultural types than does the United
  States. In addition to the presence of surviving Native Americans (including American
  Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos) and the descendants of Africans taken as slaves to
  the New World, the national character has been enriched, tested, and constantly
  redefined by the tens of millions of immigrants who by and large have come to America
  hoping for greater social, political, and economic opportunities than they had in
  the places they left. (It should be noted that although the terms “America” and
  “Americans” are often used as synonyms for the United States and its citizens, respectively,
  they are also used in a broader sense for North, South, and Central America collectively
  and their citizens.)The United States is the world’s greatest economic power, measured
  in terms of gross national product (GNP). The nation’s wealth is partly a reflection
  of its rich natural resources and its enormous agricultural output, but it owes
  more to the country’s highly developed industry. Despite its relative economic self-sufficiency
  in many areas, the United States is the most important single factor in world trade
  by virtue of the sheer size of its economy. Its exports and imports represent major
  proportions of the world total. The United States also impinges on the global economy
  as a source of and as a destination for investment capital. The country continues
  to sustain an economic life that is more diversified than any other on Earth, providing
  the majority of its people with one of the world’s highest standards of living.The
  United States is relatively young by world standards, being barely more than 200
  years old; it achieved its current size only in the mid-20th century. America was
  the first of the European colonies to separate successfully from its motherland,
  and it was the first nation to be established on the premise that sovereignty rests
  with its citizens and not with the government. In its first century and a half,
  the country was mainly preoccupied with its own territorial expansion and economic
  growth and with social debates that ultimately led to civil war and a healing period
  that is still not complete. In the 20th century the United States emerged as a world
  power, and since World War II it has been one of the preeminent powers. It has not
  accepted this mantle easily nor always carried it willingly; the principles and
  ideals of its founders have been tested by the pressures and exigencies of its dominant
  status. Although the United States still offers its residents opportunities for
  unparalleled personal advancement and wealth, the depletion of its resources, contamination
  of its environment, and continuing social and economic inequality that perpetuates
  areas of poverty and blight all threaten the fabric of the country.The District
  of Columbia is discussed in the article Washington. For discussion of other major
  U.S. cities, see the articles Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York
  City, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. Political units in association with the United
  States include Puerto Rico, discussed in the article Puerto Rico, and several Pacific
  islands, discussed in Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa.The two
  great sets of elements that mold the physical environment of the United States are,
  first, the geologic, which determines the main patterns of landforms, drainage,
  and mineral resources and influences soils to a lesser degree, and, second, the
  atmospheric, which dictates not only climate and weather but also in large part
  the distribution of soils, plants, and animals. Although these elements are not
  entirely independent of one another, each produces on a map patterns that are so
  profoundly different that essentially they remain two separate geographies. (Since
  this article covers only the coterminous United States, see also the articles Alaska
  and Hawaii.)The centre of the coterminous United States is a great sprawling interior
  lowland, reaching from the ancient shield of central Canada on the north to the
  Gulf of Mexico on the south. To east and west this lowland rises, first gradually
  and then abruptly, to mountain ranges that divide it from the sea on both sides.
  The two mountain systems differ drastically. The Appalachian Mountains on the east
  are low, almost unbroken, and in the main set well back from the Atlantic. From
  New York to the Mexican border stretches the low Coastal Plain, which faces the
  ocean along a swampy, convoluted coast. The gently sloping surface of the plain
  extends out beneath the sea, where it forms the continental shelf, which, although
  submerged beneath shallow ocean water, is geologically identical to the Coastal
  Plain. Southward the plain grows wider, swinging westward in Georgia and Alabama
  to truncate the Appalachians along their southern extremity and separate the interior
  lowland from the Gulf.West of the Central Lowland is the mighty Cordillera, part
  of a global mountain system that rings the Pacific Basin. The Cordillera encompasses
  fully one-third of the United States, with an internal variety commensurate with
  its size. At its eastern margin lie the Rocky Mountains, a high, diverse, and discontinuous
  chain that stretches all the way from New Mexico to the Canadian border. The Cordillera’s
  western edge is a Pacific coastal chain of rugged mountains and inland valleys,
  the whole rising spectacularly from the sea without benefit of a coastal plain.
  Pent between the Rockies and the Pacific chain is a vast intermontane complex of
  basins, plateaus, and isolated ranges so large and remarkable that they merit recognition
  as a region separate from the Cordillera itself.These regions—the Interior Lowlands
  and their upland fringes, the Appalachian Mountain system, the Atlantic Plain, the
  Western Cordillera, and the Western Intermontane Region—are so various that they
  require further division into 24 major subregions, or provinces (see map).Midwest
  States: GeographyEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Andrew Jackson is supposed to have
  remarked that the United States begins at the Alleghenies, implying that only west
  of the mountains, in the isolation and freedom of the great Interior Lowlands, could
  people finally escape Old World influences. Whether or not the lowlands constitute
  the country’s cultural core is debatable, but there can be no doubt that they comprise
  its geologic core and in many ways its geographic core as well.This enormous region
  rests upon an ancient, much-eroded platform of complex crystalline rocks that have
  for the most part lain undisturbed by major orogenic (mountain-building) activity
  for more than 600,000,000 years. Over much of central Canada, these Precambrian
  rocks are exposed at the surface and form the continent’s single largest topographical
  region, the formidable and ice-scoured Canadian Shield.In the United States most
  of the crystalline platform is concealed under a deep blanket of sedimentary rocks.
  In the far north, however, the naked Canadian Shield extends into the United States
  far enough to form two small but distinctive landform regions: the rugged and occasionally
  spectacular Adirondack Mountains of northern New York; and the more subdued but
  austere Superior Uplands of northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. As in the
  rest of the shield, glaciers have stripped soils away, strewn the surface with boulders
  and other debris, and obliterated preglacial drainage systems. Most attempts at
  farming in these areas have been abandoned, but the combination of a comparative
  wilderness in a northern climate, clear lakes, and white-water streams has fostered
  the development of both regions as year-round outdoor recreation areas.Mineral wealth
  in the Superior Uplands is legendary. Iron lies near the surface and close to the
  deepwater ports of the upper Great Lakes. Iron is mined both north and south of
  Lake Superior, but best known are the colossal deposits of Minnesota’s Mesabi Range,
  for more than a century one of the world’s richest and a vital element in America’s
  rise to industrial power. In spite of depletion, the Minnesota and Michigan mines
  still yield a major proportion of the country’s iron and a significant percentage
  of the world’s supply.South of the Adirondack Mountains and Superior Uplands lies
  the boundary between crystalline and sedimentary rocks; abruptly, everything is
  different. The core of this sedimentary region—the heartland of the United States—is
  the great Central Lowland, which stretches for 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometres) from
  New York to central Texas and north another 1,000 miles to the Canadian province
  of Saskatchewan. To some, the landscape may seem dull, for heights of more than
  2,000 feet (600 metres) are unusual, and truly rough terrain is almost lacking.
  Landscapes are varied, however, largely as the result of glaciation that directly
  or indirectly affected most of the subregion. North of the Missouri–Ohio river line,
  the advance and readvance of continental ice left an intricate mosaic of boulders,
  sand, gravel, silt, and clay and a complex pattern of lakes and drainage channels,
  some abandoned, some still in use. The southern part of the Central Lowland is quite
  different, covered mostly with loess (wind-deposited silt) that further subdued
  the already low relief surface. Elsewhere, especially near major rivers, postglacial
  streams carved the loess into rounded hills, and visitors have aptly compared their
  billowing shapes to the waves of the sea. Above all, the loess produces soil of
  extraordinary fertility. As the Mesabi iron was a major source of America’s industrial
  wealth, its agricultural prosperity has been rooted in Midwestern loess.The Central
  Lowland resembles a vast saucer, rising gradually to higher lands on all sides.
  Southward and eastward, the land rises gradually to three major plateaus. Beyond
  the reach of glaciation to the south, the sedimentary rocks have been raised into
  two broad upwarps, separated from one another by the great valley of the Mississippi
  River. The Ozark Plateau lies west of the river and occupies most of southern Missouri
  and northern Arkansas; on the east the Interior Low Plateaus dominate central Kentucky
  and Tennessee. Except for two nearly circular patches of rich limestone country—the
  Nashville Basin of Tennessee and the Kentucky Bluegrass region—most of both plateau
  regions consists of sandstone uplands, intricately dissected by streams. Local relief
  runs to several hundreds of feet in most places, and visitors to the region must
  travel winding roads along narrow stream valleys. The soils there are poor, and
  mineral resources are scanty.Eastward from the Central Lowland the Appalachian Plateau—a
  narrow band of dissected uplands that strongly resembles the Ozark Plateau and Interior
  Low Plateaus in steep slopes, wretched soils, and endemic poverty—forms a transition
  between the interior plains and the Appalachian Mountains. Usually, however, the
  Appalachian Plateau is considered a subregion of the Appalachian Mountains, partly
  on grounds of location, partly because of geologic structure. Unlike the other plateaus,
  where rocks are warped upward, the rocks there form an elongated basin, wherein
  bituminous coal has been preserved from erosion. This Appalachian coal, like the
  Mesabi iron that it complements in U.S. industry, is extraordinary. Extensive, thick,
  and close to the surface, it has stoked the furnaces of northeastern steel mills
  for decades and helps explain the huge concentration of heavy industry along the
  lower Great Lakes.The western flanks of the Interior Lowlands are the Great Plains,
  a territory of awesome bulk that spans the full distance between Canada and Mexico
  in a swath nearly 500 miles wide. The Great Plains were built by successive layers
  of poorly cemented sand, silt, and gravel—debris laid down by parallel east-flowing
  streams from the Rocky Mountains. Seen from the east, the surface of the Great Plains
  rises inexorably from about 2,000 feet near Omaha, Neb., to more than 6,000 feet
  at Cheyenne, Wyo., but the climb is so gradual that popular legend holds the Great
  Plains to be flat. True flatness is rare, although the High Plains of western Texas,
  Oklahoma, Kansas, and eastern Colorado come close. More commonly, the land is broadly
  rolling, and parts of the northern plains are sharply dissected into badlands.The
  main mineral wealth of the Interior Lowlands derives from fossil fuels. Coal occurs
  in structural basins protected from erosion—high-quality bituminous in the Appalachian,
  Illinois, and western Kentucky basins; and subbituminous and lignite in the eastern
  and northwestern Great Plains. Petroleum and natural gas have been found in nearly
  every state between the Appalachians and the Rockies, but the Midcontinent Fields
  of western Texas and the Texas Panhandle, Oklahoma, and Kansas surpass all others.
  Aside from small deposits of lead and zinc, metallic minerals are of little importance.Screw
  Auger Falls© George WuerthnerThe Appalachians dominate the eastern United States
  and separate the Eastern Seaboard from the interior with a belt of subdued uplands
  that extends nearly 1,500 miles from northeastern Alabama to the Canadian border.
  They are old, complex mountains, the eroded stumps of much greater ranges. Present
  topography results from erosion that has carved weak rocks away, leaving a skeleton
  of resistant rocks behind as highlands. Geologic differences are thus faithfully
  reflected in topography. In the Appalachians these differences are sharply demarcated
  and neatly arranged, so that all the major subdivisions except New England lie in
  strips parallel to the Atlantic and to one another.The core of the Appalachians
  is a belt of complex metamorphic and igneous rocks that stretches all the way from
  Alabama to New Hampshire. The western side of this belt forms the long slender rampart
  of the Blue Ridge Mountains, containing the highest elevations in the Appalachians
  (Mount Mitchell, N.C., 6,684 feet [2,037 metres]) and some of its most handsome
  mountain scenery. On its eastern, or seaward, side the Blue Ridge descends in an
  abrupt and sometimes spectacular escarpment to the Piedmont, a well-drained, rolling
  land—never quite hills, but never quite a plain. Before the settlement of the Midwest
  the Piedmont was the most productive agricultural region in the United States, and
  several Pennsylvania counties still consistently report some of the highest farm
  yields per acre in the entire country.West of the crystalline zone, away from the
  axis of primary geologic deformation, sedimentary rocks have escaped metamorphism
  but are compressed into tight folds. Erosion has carved the upturned edges of these
  folded rocks into the remarkable Ridge and Valley country of the western Appalachians.
  Long linear ridges characteristically stand about 1,000 feet from base to crest
  and run for tens of miles, paralleled by broad open valleys of comparable length.
  In Pennsylvania, ridges run unbroken for great distances, occasionally turning abruptly
  in a zigzag pattern; by contrast, the southern ridges are broken by faults and form
  short, parallel segments that are lined up like magnetized iron filings. By far
  the largest valley—and one of the most important routes in North America—is the
  Great Valley, an extraordinary trench of shale and limestone that runs nearly the
  entire length of the Appalachians. It provides a lowland passage from the middle
  Hudson valley to Harrisburg, Pa., and on southward, where it forms the Shenandoah
  and Cumberland valleys, and has been one of the main paths through the Appalachians
  since pioneer times. In New England it is floored with slates and marbles and forms
  the Valley of Vermont, one of the few fertile areas in an otherwise mountainous
  region.Topography much like that of the Ridge and Valley is found in the Ouachita
  Mountains of western Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma, an area generally thought to
  be a detached continuation of Appalachian geologic structure, the intervening section
  buried beneath the sediments of the lower Mississippi valley.The once-glaciated
  New England section of the Appalachians is divided from the rest of the chain by
  an indentation of the Atlantic. Although almost completely underlain by crystalline
  rocks, New England is laid out in north–south bands, reminiscent of the southern
  Appalachians. The rolling, rocky hills of southeastern New England are not dissimilar
  to the Piedmont, while, farther northwest, the rugged and lofty White Mountains
  are a New England analogue to the Blue Ridge. (Mount Washington, N.H., at 6,288
  feet [1917 metres], is the highest peak in the northeastern United States.) The
  westernmost ranges—the Taconics, Berkshires, and Green Mountains—show a strong north–south
  lineation like the Ridge and Valley. Unlike the rest of the Appalachians, however,
  glaciation has scoured the crystalline rocks much like those of the Canadian Shield,
  so that New England is best known for its picturesque landscape, not for its fertile
  soil.Typical of diverse geologic regions, the Appalachians contain a great variety
  of minerals. Only a few occur in quantities large enough for sustained exploitation,
  notably iron in Pennsylvania’s Blue Ridge and Piedmont and the famous granites,
  marbles, and slates of northern New England. In Pennsylvania the Ridge and Valley
  region contains one of the world’s largest deposits of anthracite coal, once the
  basis of a thriving mining economy; many of the mines are now shut, oil and gas
  having replaced coal as the major fuel used to heat homes.Northeast USA: Physical
  LandscapeEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The eastern and southeastern fringes of the
  United States are part of the outermost margins of the continental platform, repeatedly
  invaded by the sea and veneered with layer after layer of young, poorly consolidated
  sediments. Part of this platform now lies slightly above sea level and forms a nearly
  flat and often swampy coastal plain, which stretches from Cape Cod, Mass., to beyond
  the Mexican border. Most of the platform, however, is still submerged, so that a
  band of shallow water, the continental shelf, parallels the Atlantic and Gulf coasts,
  in some places reaching 250 miles out to sea.The Atlantic Plain slopes so gently
  that even slight crustal upwarping can shift the coastline far out to sea at the
  expense of the continental shelf. The peninsula of Florida is just such an upwarp;
  nowhere in its 400-mile length does the land rise more than 350 feet above sea level;
  much of the southern and coastal areas rise less than 10 feet and are poorly drained
  and dangerously exposed to Atlantic storms. Downwarps can result in extensive flooding.
  North of New York City, for example, the weight of glacial ice depressed most of
  the Coastal Plain beneath the sea, and the Atlantic now beats directly against New
  England’s rock-ribbed coasts. Cape Cod, Long Island (N.Y.), and a few offshore islands
  are all that remain of New England’s drowned Coastal Plain. Another downwarp lies
  perpendicular to the Gulf coast and guides the course of the lower Mississippi.
  The river, however, has filled with alluvium what otherwise would be an arm of the
  Gulf, forming a great inland salient of the Coastal Plain called the Mississippi
  Embayment.The Southeast: GeographyEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.South of New York
  the Coastal Plain gradually widens, but ocean water has invaded the lower valleys
  of most of the coastal rivers and has turned them into estuaries. The greatest of
  these is Chesapeake Bay, merely the flooded lower valley of the Susquehanna River
  and its tributaries, but there are hundreds of others. Offshore a line of sandbars
  and barrier beaches stretches intermittently the length of the Coastal Plain, hampering
  entry of shipping into the estuaries but providing the eastern United States with
  a playground that is more than 1,000 miles long.Poor soils are the rule on the Coastal
  Plain, though rare exceptions have formed some of America’s most famous agricultural
  regions—for example, the citrus country of central Florida’s limestone uplands and
  the Cotton Belt of the Old South, once centred on the alluvial plain of the Mississippi
  and belts of chalky black soils of eastern Texas, Alabama, and Mississippi. The
  Atlantic Plain’s greatest natural wealth derives from petroleum and natural gas
  trapped in domal structures that dot the Gulf Coast of eastern Texas and Louisiana.
  Onshore and offshore drilling have revealed colossal reserves of oil and natural
  gas.Mountain Region: GeographyEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.West of the Great Plains
  the United States seems to become a craggy land whose skyline is rarely without
  mountains—totally different from the open plains and rounded hills of the East.
  On a map the alignment of the two main chains—the Rocky Mountains on the east, the
  Pacific ranges on the west—tempts one to assume a geologic and hence topographic
  homogeneity. Nothing could be farther from the truth, for each chain is divided
  into widely disparate sections.The Rockies are typically diverse. The Southern Rockies
  are composed of a disconnected series of lofty elongated upwarps, their cores made
  of granitic basement rocks, stripped of sediments, and heavily glaciated at high
  elevations. In New Mexico and along the western flanks of the Colorado ranges, widespread
  volcanism and deformation of colourful sedimentary rocks have produced rugged and
  picturesque country, but the characteristic central Colorado or southern Wyoming
  range is impressively austere rather than spectacular. The Front Range west of Denver
  is prototypical, rising abruptly from its base at about 6,000 feet to rolling alpine
  meadows between 11,000 and 12,000 feet. Peaks appear as low hills perched on this
  high-level surface, so that Colorado, for example, boasts 53 mountains over 14,000
  feet but not one over 14,500 feet.The Middle Rockies cover most of west central
  Wyoming. Most of the ranges resemble the granitic upwarps of Colorado, but thrust
  faulting and volcanism have produced varied and spectacular country to the west,
  some of which is included in Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks. Much of
  the subregion, however, is not mountainous at all but consists of extensive intermontane
  basins and plains—largely floored with enormous volumes of sedimentary waste eroded
  from the mountains themselves. Whole ranges have been buried, producing the greatest
  gap in the Cordilleran system, the Wyoming Basin—resembling in geologic structure
  and topography an intermontane peninsula of the Great Plains. As a result, the Rockies
  have never posed an important barrier to east–west transportation in the United
  States; all major routes, from the Oregon Trail to interstate highways, funnel through
  the basin, essentially circumventing the main ranges of the Rockies.The Northern
  Rockies contain the most varied mountain landscapes of the Cordillera, reflecting
  a corresponding geologic complexity. The region’s backbone is a mighty series of
  batholiths—huge masses of molten rock that slowly cooled below the surface and were
  later uplifted. The batholiths are eroded into rugged granitic ranges, which, in
  central Idaho, compose the most extensive wilderness country in the coterminous
  United States. East of the batholiths and opposite the Great Plains, sediments have
  been folded and thrust-faulted into a series of linear north–south ranges, a southern
  extension of the spectacular Canadian Rockies. Although elevations run 2,000 to
  3,000 feet lower than the Colorado Rockies (most of the Idaho Rockies lie well below
  10,000 feet), increased rainfall and northern latitude have encouraged glaciation—there
  as elsewhere a sculptor of handsome alpine landscape.The Pacific Region: OverviewEncyclopædia
  Britannica, Inc.The western branch of the Cordillera directly abuts the Pacific
  Ocean. This coastal chain, like its Rocky Mountain cousins on the eastern flank
  of the Cordillera, conceals bewildering complexity behind a facade of apparent simplicity.
  At first glance the chain consists merely of two lines of mountains with a discontinuous
  trough between them. Immediately behind the coast is a line of hills and low mountains—the
  Pacific Coast Ranges. Farther inland, averaging 150 miles from the coast, the line
  of the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range includes the highest elevations in the
  coterminous United States. Between these two unequal mountain lines is a discontinuous
  trench, the Troughs of the Coastal Margin.Kings Canyon National ParkJosef MuenchThe
  apparent simplicity disappears under the most cursory examination. The Pacific Coast
  Ranges actually contain five distinct sections, each of different geologic origin
  and each with its own distinctive topography. The Transverse Ranges of southern
  California are a crowded assemblage of islandlike faulted ranges, with peak elevations
  of more than 10,000 feet but sufficiently separated by plains and low passes so
  that travel through them is easy. From Point Conception to the Oregon border, however,
  the main California Coast Ranges are entirely different, resembling the Appalachian
  Ridge and Valley region, with low linear ranges that result from erosion of faulted
  and folded rocks. Major faults run parallel to the low ridges, and the greatest—the
  notorious San Andreas Fault—was responsible for the earthquake that all but destroyed
  San Francisco in 1906. Along the California–Oregon border, everything changes again.
  In this region, the wildly rugged Klamath Mountains represent a western salient
  of interior structure reminiscent of the Idaho Rockies and the northern Sierra Nevada.
  In western Oregon and southwestern Washington the Coast Ranges are also different—a
  gentle, hilly land carved by streams from a broad arch of marine deposits interbedded
  with tabular lavas. In the northernmost part of the Coast Ranges and the remote
  northwest, a domal upwarp has produced the Olympic Mountains; its serrated peaks
  tower nearly 8,000 feet above Puget Sound and the Pacific, and the heavy precipitation
  on its upper slopes supports the largest active glaciers in the United States outside
  of Alaska.East of these Pacific Coast Ranges the Troughs of the Coastal Margin contain
  the only extensive lowland plains of the Pacific margin—California’s Central Valley,
  Oregon’s Willamette River valley, and the half-drowned basin of Puget Sound in Washington.
  Parts of an inland trench that extends for great distances along the east coast
  of the Pacific, similar valleys occur in such diverse areas as Chile and the Alaska
  panhandle. These valleys are blessed with superior soils, easily irrigated, and
  very accessible from the Pacific. They have enticed settlers for more than a century
  and have become the main centres of population and economic activity for much of
  the U.S. West Coast.Still farther east rise the two highest mountain chains in the
  coterminous United States—the Cascades and the Sierra Nevada. Aside from elevation,
  geographic continuity, and spectacular scenery, however, the two ranges differ in
  almost every important respect. Except for its northern section, where sedimentary
  and metamorphic rocks occur, the Sierra Nevada is largely made of granite, part
  of the same batholithic chain that creates the Idaho Rockies. The range is grossly
  asymmetrical, the result of massive faulting that has gently tilted the western
  slopes toward the Central Valley but has uplifted the eastern side to confront the
  interior with an escarpment nearly two miles high. At high elevation glaciers have
  scoured the granites to a gleaming white, while on the west the ice has carved spectacular
  valleys such as the Yosemite. The loftiest peak in the Sierras is Mount Whitney,
  which at 14,494 feet (4,418 metres) is the highest mountain in the coterminous states.
  The upfaulting that produced Mount Whitney is accompanied by downfaulting that formed
  nearby Death Valley, at 282 feet (86 metres) below sea level the lowest point in
  North America.The Cascades are made largely of volcanic rock; those in northern
  Washington contain granite like the Sierras, but the rest are formed from relatively
  recent lava outpourings of dun-coloured basalt and andesite. The Cascades are in
  effect two ranges. The lower, older range is a long belt of upwarped lava, rising
  unspectacularly to elevations between 6,000 and 8,000 feet. Perched above the “low
  Cascades” is a chain of lofty volcanoes that punctuate the horizon with magnificent
  glacier-clad peaks. The highest is Mount Rainier, which at 14,410 feet (4,392 metres)
  is all the more dramatic for rising from near sea level. Most of these volcanoes
  are quiescent, but they are far from extinct. Mount Lassen in northern California
  erupted violently in 1914, as did Mount St. Helens in the state of Washington in
  1980. Most of the other high Cascade volcanoes exhibit some sign of seismic activity.Beartooth
  Range© John ElkThe Cordillera’s two main chains enclose a vast intermontane region
  of arid basins, plateaus, and isolated mountain ranges that stretches from the Mexican
  border nearly to Canada and extends 600 miles from east to west. This enormous territory
  contains three huge subregions, each with a distinctive geologic history and its
  own striking topography.The Colorado Plateau, nestled against the western flanks
  of the Southern Rockies, is an extraordinary island of geologic stability set in
  the turbulent sea of Cordilleran tectonic activity. Stability was not absolute,
  of course, so that parts of the plateau are warped and injected with volcanics,
  but in general the landscape results from the erosion by streams of nearly flat-lying
  sedimentary rocks. The result is a mosaic of angular mesas, buttes, and steplike
  canyons intricately cut from rocks that often are vividly coloured. Large areas
  of the plateau are so improbably picturesque that they have been set aside as national
  preserves. The Grand Canyon of the Colorado River is the most famous of several
  dozen such areas.West of the plateau and abutting the Sierra Nevada’s eastern escarpment
  lies the arid Basin and Range subregion, among the most remarkable topographic provinces
  of the United States. The Basin and Range extends from southern Oregon and Idaho
  into northern Mexico. Rocks of great complexity have been broken by faulting, and
  the resulting blocks have tumbled, eroded, and been partly buried by lava and alluvial
  debris accumulating in the desert basins. The eroded blocks form mountain ranges
  that are characteristically dozens of miles long, several thousand feet from base
  to crest, with peak elevations that rarely rise to more than 10,000 feet, and almost
  always aligned roughly north–south. The basin floors are typically alluvium and
  sometimes salt marshes or alkali flats.The third intermontane region, the Columbia
  Basin, is literally the last, for in some parts its rocks are still being formed.
  Its entire area is underlain by innumerable tabular lava flows that have flooded
  the basin between the Cascades and Northern Rockies to undetermined depths. The
  volume of lava must be measured in thousands of cubic miles, for the flows blanket
  large parts of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho and in southern Idaho have drowned
  the flanks of the Northern Rocky Mountains in a basaltic sea. Where the lavas are
  fresh, as in southern Idaho, the surface is often nearly flat, but more often the
  floors have been trenched by rivers—conspicuously the Columbia and the Snake—or
  by glacial floodwaters that have carved an intricate system of braided canyons in
  the remarkable Channeled Scablands of eastern Washington. In surface form the eroded
  lava often resembles the topography of the Colorado Plateau, but the gaudy colours
  of the Colorado are replaced here by the sombre black and rusty brown of weathered
  basalt.Most large mountain systems are sources of varied mineral wealth, and the
  American Cordillera is no exception. Metallic minerals have been taken from most
  crystalline regions and have furnished the United States with both romance and wealth—the
  Sierra Nevada gold that provoked the 1849 gold rush, the fabulous silver lodes of
  western Nevada’s Basin and Range, and gold strikes all along the Rocky Mountain
  chain. Industrial metals, however, are now far more important; copper and lead are
  among the base metals, and the more exotic molybdenum, vanadium, and cadmium are
  mainly useful in alloys.In the Cordillera, as elsewhere, the greatest wealth stems
  from fuels. Most major basins contain oil and natural gas, conspicuously the Wyoming
  Basin, the Central Valley of California, and the Los Angeles Basin. The Colorado
  Plateau, however, has yielded some of the most interesting discoveries—considerable
  deposits of uranium and colossal occurrences of oil shale. Oil from the shale, however,
  probably cannot be economically removed without widespread strip-mining and correspondingly
  large-scale damage to the environment. Wide exploitation of low-sulfur bituminous
  coal has been initiated in the Four Corners area of the Colorado Plateau, and open-pit
  mining has already devastated parts of this once-pristine country as completely
  as it has West Virginia.As befits a nation of continental proportions, the United
  States has an extraordinary network of rivers and lakes, including some of the largest
  and most useful in the world. In the humid East they provide an enormous mileage
  of cheap inland transportation; westward, most rivers and streams are unnavigable
  but are heavily used for irrigation and power generation. Both East and West, however,
  traditionally have used lakes and streams as public sewers, and despite efforts
  to clean them up, most large waterways are laden with vast, poisonous volumes of
  industrial, agricultural, and human wastes.Chief among U.S. rivers is the Mississippi,
  which, with its great tributaries, the Ohio and the Missouri, drains most of the
  midcontinent. The Mississippi is navigable to Minneapolis nearly 1,200 miles by
  air from the Gulf of Mexico; and along with the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence system
  it forms the world’s greatest network of inland waterways. The Mississippi’s eastern
  branches, chiefly the Ohio and the Tennessee, are also navigable for great distances.
  From the west, however, many of its numerous Great Plains tributaries are too seasonal
  and choked with sandbars to be used for shipping. The Missouri, for example, though
  longer than the Mississippi itself, was essentially without navigation until the
  mid-20th century, when a combination of dams, locks, and dredging opened the river
  to barge traffic.The Great Lakes–St. Lawrence system, the other half of the midcontinental
  inland waterway, is connected to the Mississippi–Ohio via Chicago by canals and
  the Illinois River. The five Great Lakes (four of which are shared with Canada)
  constitute by far the largest freshwater lake group in the world and carry a larger
  tonnage of shipping than any other. The three main barriers to navigation—the St.
  Marys Rapids, at Sault Sainte Marie; Niagara Falls; and the rapids of the St. Lawrence—are
  all bypassed by locks, whose 27-foot draft lets ocean vessels penetrate 1,300 miles
  into the continent, as far as Duluth, Minnesota, and Chicago.The third group of
  Eastern rivers drains the coastal strip along the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of
  Mexico. Except for the Rio Grande, which rises west of the Rockies and flows about
  1,900 circuitous miles to the Gulf, few of these coastal rivers measure more than
  300 miles, and most flow in an almost straight line to the sea. Except in glaciated
  New England and in arid southwestern Texas, most of the larger coastal streams are
  navigable for some distance.West of the Rockies, nearly all of the rivers are strongly
  influenced by aridity. In the deserts and steppes of the intermontane basins, most
  of the scanty runoff disappears into interior basins, only one of which, the Great
  Salt Lake, holds any substantial volume of water. Aside from a few minor coastal
  streams, only three large river systems manage to reach the sea—the Columbia, the
  Colorado, and the San Joaquin–Sacramento system of California’s Central Valley.
  All three of these river systems are exotic: that is, they flow for considerable
  distances across dry lands from which they receive little water. Both the Columbia
  and the Colorado have carved awesome gorges, the former through the sombre lavas
  of the Cascades and the Columbia Basin, the latter through the brilliantly coloured
  rocks of the Colorado Plateau. These gorges lend themselves to easy damming, and
  the once-wild Columbia has been turned into a stairway of placid lakes whose waters
  irrigate the arid plateaus of eastern Washington and power one of the world’s largest
  hydroelectric networks. The Colorado is less extensively developed, and proposals
  for new dam construction have met fierce opposition from those who want to preserve
  the spectacular natural beauty of the river’s canyon lands.Climate affects human
  habitats both directly and indirectly through its influence on vegetation, soils,
  and wildlife. In the United States, however, the natural environment has been altered
  drastically by nearly four centuries of European settlement, as well as thousands
  of years of Indian occupancy.Wherever land is abandoned, however, “wild” conditions
  return rapidly, achieving over the long run a dynamic equilibrium among soils, vegetation,
  and the inexorable strictures of climate. Thus, though Americans have created an
  artificial environment of continental proportions, the United States still can be
  divided into a mosaic of bioclimatic regions, each of them distinguished by peculiar
  climatic conditions and each with a potential vegetation and soil that eventually
  would return in the absence of humans. The main exception to this generalization
  applies to fauna, so drastically altered that it is almost impossible to know what
  sort of animal geography would redevelop in the areas of the United States if humans
  were removed from the scene.The pattern of U.S. climates is largely set by the location
  of the coterminous United States almost entirely in the middle latitudes, by its
  position with respect to the continental landmass and its fringing oceans, and by
  the nation’s gross pattern of mountains and lowlands. Each of these geographic controls
  operates to determine the character of air masses and their changing behaviour from
  season to season.The coterminous United States lies entirely between the tropic
  of Cancer and 50° N latitude, a position that confines Arctic climates to the high
  mountaintops and genuine tropics to a small part of southern Florida. By no means,
  however, is the climate literally temperate, for the middle latitudes are notorious
  for extreme variations of temperature and precipitation.The great size of the North
  American landmass tends to reinforce these extremes. Since land heats and cools
  more rapidly than bodies of water, places distant from an ocean tend to have continental
  climates; that is, they alternate between extremes of hot summers and cold winters,
  in contrast to the marine climates, which are more equable. Most U.S. climates are
  markedly continental, the more so because the Cordillera effectively confines the
  moderating Pacific influence to a narrow strip along the West Coast. Extremes of
  continentality occur near the centre of the country, and in North Dakota temperatures
  have ranged between a summer high record of 121 °F (49 °C) and a winter low of −60
  °F (−51 °C). Moreover, the general eastward drift of air over the United States
  carries continental temperatures all the way to the Atlantic coast. Bismarck, N.D.,
  for example, has a great annual temperature range. Boston, on the Atlantic but largely
  exempt from its influence, has a lesser but still-continental range, while San Francisco,
  which is under strong Pacific influence, has only a small summer–winter differential.In
  addition to confining Pacific temperatures to the coastal margin, the Pacific Coast
  Ranges are high enough to make a local rain shadow in their lee, although the main
  barrier is the great rampart formed by the Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges. Rainy
  on their western slopes and barren on the east, this mountain crest forms one of
  the sharpest climatic divides in the United States.The rain shadow continues east
  to the Rockies, leaving the entire Intermontane Region either arid or semiarid,
  except where isolated ranges manage to capture leftover moisture at high altitudes.
  East of the Rockies the westerly drift brings mainly dry air, and as a result, the
  Great Plains are semiarid. Still farther east, humidity increases owing to the frequent
  incursion from the south of warm, moist, and unstable air from the Gulf of Mexico,
  which produces more precipitation in the United States than the Pacific and Atlantic
  oceans combined.Although the landforms of the Interior Lowlands have been termed
  dull, there is nothing dull about their weather conditions. Air from the Gulf of
  Mexico can flow northward across the Great Plains, uninterrupted by topographical
  barriers, but continental Canadian air flows south by the same route, and, since
  these two air masses differ in every important respect, the collisions often produce
  disturbances of monumental violence. Plainsmen and Midwesterners are accustomed
  to sudden displays of furious weather—tornadoes, blizzards, hailstorms, precipitous
  drops and rises in temperature, and a host of other spectacular meteorological displays,
  sometimes dangerous but seldom boring.Most of the United States is marked by sharp
  differences between winter and summer. In winter, when temperature contrasts between
  land and water are greatest, huge masses of frigid, dry Canadian air periodically
  spread far south over the midcontinent, bringing cold, sparkling weather to the
  interior and generating great cyclonic storms where their leading edges confront
  the shrunken mass of warm Gulf air to the south. Although such cyclonic activity
  occurs throughout the year, it is most frequent and intense during the winter, parading
  eastward out of the Great Plains to bring the Eastern states practically all their
  winter precipitation. Winter temperatures differ widely, depending largely on latitude.
  Thus, New Orleans, La., at 30° N latitude, and International Falls, Minn., at 49°
  N, have respective January temperature averages of 55 °F (13 °C) and 3 °F (−16°
  C). In the north, therefore, precipitation often comes as snow, often driven by
  furious winds; farther south, cold rain alternates with sleet and occasional snow.
  Southern Florida is the only dependably warm part of the East, though “polar outbursts”
  have been known to bring temperatures below 0 °F (−18 °C) as far south as Tallahassee.
  The main uniformity of Eastern weather in wintertime is the expectation of frequent
  change.Winter climate on the West Coast is very different. A great spiraling mass
  of relatively warm, moist air spreads south from the Aleutian Islands of Alaska,
  its semipermanent front producing gloomy overcast and drizzles that hang over the
  Pacific Northwest all winter long, occasionally reaching southern California, which
  receives nearly all of its rain at this time of year. This Pacific air brings mild
  temperatures along the length of the coast; the average January day in Seattle,
  Wash., ranges between 33 and 44 °F (1 and 7 °C) and in Los Angeles between 45 and
  64 °F (7 and 18 °C). In southern California, however, rains are separated by long
  spells of fair weather, and the whole region is a winter haven for those seeking
  refuge from less agreeable weather in other parts of the country. The Intermontane
  Region is similar to the Pacific Coast, but with much less rainfall and a considerably
  wider range of temperatures.During the summer there is a reversal of the air masses,
  and east of the Rockies the change resembles the summer monsoon of Southeast Asia.
  As the midcontinent heats up, the cold Canadian air mass weakens and retreats, pushed
  north by an aggressive mass of warm, moist air from the Gulf. The great winter temperature
  differential between North and South disappears as the hot, soggy blanket spreads
  from the Gulf coast to the Canadian border. Heat and humidity are naturally most
  oppressive in the South, but there is little comfort in the more northern latitudes.
  In Houston, Texas, the temperature on a typical July day reaches 93 °F (34 °C),
  with relative humidity averaging near 75 percent, but Minneapolis, Minn., more than
  1,000 miles north, is only slightly cooler and less humid.Since the Gulf air is
  unstable as well as wet, convectional and frontal summer thunderstorms are endemic
  east of the Rockies, accounting for a majority of total summer rain. These storms
  usually drench small areas with short-lived, sometimes violent downpours, so that
  crops in one Midwestern county may prosper, those in another shrivel in drought,
  and those in yet another be flattened by hailstones. Relief from the humid heat
  comes in the northern Midwest from occasional outbursts of cool Canadian air; small
  but more consistent relief is found downwind from the Great Lakes and at high elevations
  in the Appalachians. East of the Rockies, however, U.S. summers are distinctly uncomfortable,
  and air conditioning is viewed as a desirable amenity in most areas.The Pacific
  Region: GeographyEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Again, the Pacific regime is different.
  The moist Aleutian air retreats northward, to be replaced by mild, stable air from
  over the subtropical but cool waters of the Pacific, and except in the mountains
  the Pacific Coast is nearly rainless though often foggy. In the meanwhile, a small
  but potent mass of dry hot air raises temperatures to blistering levels over much
  of the intermontane Southwest. In Yuma, Ariz., for example, the normal temperature
  in July reaches 107 °F (42 °C), while nearby Death Valley, Calif., holds the national
  record, 134 °F (57 °C). During its summer peak this scorching air mass spreads from
  the Pacific margin as far as Texas on the east and Idaho to the north, turning the
  whole interior basin into a summer desert.Over most of the United States, as in
  most continental climates, spring and autumn are agreeable but disappointingly brief.
  Autumn is particularly idyllic in the East, with a romantic Indian summer of ripening
  corn and brilliantly coloured foliage and of mild days and frosty nights. The shift
  in dominance between marine and continental air masses, however, spawns furious
  weather in some regions. Along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, for example, autumn
  is the season for hurricanes—the American equivalent of typhoons of the Asian Pacific—which
  rage northward from the warm tropics to create havoc along the Gulf and Atlantic
  coasts as far north as New England. The Mississippi valley holds the dubious distinction
  of recording more tornadoes than any other area on Earth. These violent and often
  deadly storms usually occur over relatively small areas and are confined largely
  to spring and early summer.Three first-order bioclimatic zones encompass most of
  the coterminous United States—regions in which climatic conditions are similar enough
  to dictate similar conditions of mature (zonal) soil and potential climax vegetation
  (i.e., the assemblage of plants that would grow and reproduce indefinitely given
  stable climate and average conditions of soil and drainage). These are the Humid
  East, the Humid Pacific Coast, and the Dry West. In addition, the boundary zone
  between the Humid East and the Dry West is so large and important that it constitutes
  a separate region, the Humid–Arid Transition. Finally, because the Western Cordillera
  contains an intricate mosaic of climatic types, largely determined by local elevation
  and exposure, it is useful to distinguish the Western Mountain Climate. The first
  three zones, however, are very diverse and require further breakdown, producing
  a total of 10 main bioclimatic regions. For two reasons, the boundaries of these
  bioclimatic regions are much less distinct than boundaries of landform regions.
  First, climate varies from year to year, especially in boundary zones, whereas landforms
  obviously do not. Second, regions of climate, vegetation, and soils coincide generally
  but sometimes not precisely. Boundaries, therefore, should be interpreted as zonal
  and transitional, and rarely should be considered as sharp lines in the landscape.For
  all of their indistinct boundaries, however, these bioclimatic regions have strong
  and easily recognized identities. Such regional identity is strongly reinforced
  when a particular area falls entirely within a single bioclimatic region and at
  the same time a single landform region. The result—as in the Piedmont South, the
  central Midwest, or the western Great Plains—is a landscape with an unmistakable
  regional personality.The largest and in some ways the most important of the bioclimatic
  zones, the Humid East was where the Europeans first settled, tamed the land, and
  adapted to American conditions. In early times almost all of this territory was
  forested, a fact of central importance in American history that profoundly influenced
  both soils and wildlife. As in most of the world’s humid lands, soluble minerals
  have been leached from the earth, leaving a great family of soils called pedalfers,
  rich in relatively insoluble iron and aluminum compounds.Both forests and soils,
  however, differ considerably within this vast region. Since rainfall is ample and
  summers are warm everywhere, the main differences result from the length and severity
  of winters, which determine the length of the growing season. Winter, obviously,
  differs according to latitude, so that the Humid East is sliced into four great
  east–west bands of soils and vegetation, with progressively more amenable winters
  as one travels southward. These changes occur very gradually, however, and the boundaries
  therefore are extremely subtle.The Sub-Boreal Forest Region is the northernmost
  of these bands. It is only a small and discontinuous part of the United States,
  representing the tattered southern fringe of the vast Canadian taiga—a scrubby forest
  dominated by evergreen needle-leaf species that can endure the ferocious winters
  and reproduce during the short, erratic summers. Average growing seasons are less
  than 120 days, though localities in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula have recorded frost-free
  periods lasting as long as 161 days and as short as 76 days. Soils of this region
  that survived the scour of glaciation are miserably thin podzols—heavily leached,
  highly acid, and often interrupted by extensive stretches of bog. Most attempts
  at farming in the region long since have been abandoned.Farther south lies the Humid
  Microthermal Zone of milder winters and longer summers. Large broadleaf trees begin
  to predominate over the evergreens, producing a mixed forest of greater floristic
  variety and economic value that is famous for its brilliant autumn colours. As the
  forest grows richer in species, sterile podzols give way to more productive gray-brown
  podzolic soils, stained and fertilized with humus. Although winters are warmer than
  in the Sub-Boreal zone, and although the Great Lakes help temper the bitterest cold,
  January temperatures ordinarily average below freezing, and a winter without a few
  days of subzero temperatures is uncommon. Everywhere, the ground is solidly frozen
  and snow covered for several months of the year.Still farther south are the Humid
  Subtropics. The region’s northern boundary is one of the country’s most significant
  climatic lines: the approximate northern limit of a growing season of 180–200 days,
  the outer margin of cotton growing, and, hence, of the Old South. Most of the South
  lies in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain, for higher elevations in the Appalachians
  cause a peninsula of Northern mixed forest to extend as far south as northern Georgia.
  The red-brown podzolic soil, once moderately fertile, has been severely damaged
  by overcropping and burning. Thus much of the region that once sustained a rich,
  broadleaf-forest flora now supports poor piney woods. Throughout the South, summers
  are hot, muggy, long, and disagreeable; Dixie’s “frosty mornings” bring a welcome
  respite in winter.The southern margins of Florida contain the only real tropics
  in the coterminous United States; it is an area in which frost is almost unknown.
  Hot, rainy summers alternate with warm and somewhat drier winters, with a secondary
  rainfall peak during the autumn hurricane season—altogether a typical monsoonal
  regime. Soils and vegetation are mostly immature, however, since southern Florida
  rises so slightly above sea level that substantial areas, such as the Everglades,
  are swampy and often brackish. Peat and sand frequently masquerade as soil, and
  much of the vegetation is either salt-loving mangrove or sawgrass prairie.The western
  humid region differs from its eastern counterpart in so many ways as to be a world
  apart. Much smaller, it is crammed into a narrow littoral belt to the windward of
  the Sierra–Cascade summit, dominated by mild Pacific air, and chopped by irregular
  topography into an intricate mosaic of climatic and biotic habitats. Throughout
  the region rainfall is extremely seasonal, falling mostly in the winter half of
  the year. Summers are droughty everywhere, but the main regional differences come
  from the length of drought—from about two months in humid Seattle, Wash., to nearly
  five months in semiarid San Diego, Calif.Western Washington, Oregon, and northern
  California lie within a zone that climatologists call Marine West Coast. Winters
  are raw, overcast, and drizzly—not unlike northwestern Europe—with subfreezing temperatures
  restricted mainly to the mountains, upon which enormous snow accumulations produce
  local alpine glaciers. Summers, by contrast, are brilliantly cloudless, cool, and
  frequently foggy along the West Coast and somewhat warmer in the inland valleys.
  This mild marine climate produces some of the world’s greatest forests of enormous
  straight-boled evergreen trees that furnish the United States with much of its commercial
  timber. Mature soils are typical of humid midlatitude forestlands, a moderately
  leached gray-brown podzol.Toward the south, with diminishing coastal rain the moist
  marine climate gradually gives way to California’s tiny but much-publicized Mediterranean
  regime. Although mountainous topography introduces a bewildering variety of local
  environments, scanty winter rains are quite inadequate to compensate for the long
  summer drought, and much of the region has a distinctly arid character. For much
  of the year, cool, stable Pacific air dominates the West Coast, bringing San Francisco
  its famous fogs and Los Angeles its infamous smoggy temperature inversions. Inland,
  however, summer temperatures reach blistering levels, so that in July, while Los
  Angeles expects a normal daily maximum of 83 °F (28 °C), Fresno expects 100 °F (38
  °C) and is climatically a desert. As might be expected, Mediterranean California
  contains a huge variety of vegetal habitats, but the commonest perhaps is the chaparral,
  a drought-resistant, scrubby woodland of twisted hard-leafed trees, picturesque
  but of little economic value. Chaparral is a pyrophytic (fire-loving) vegetation—i.e.,
  under natural conditions its growth and form depend on regular burning. These fires
  constitute a major environmental hazard in the suburban hills above Los Angeles
  and San Francisco Bay, especially in autumn, when hot dry Santa Ana winds from the
  interior regularly convert brush fires into infernos. Soils are similarly varied,
  but most of them are light in colour and rich in soluble minerals, qualities typical
  of subarid soils.In the United States, to speak of dry areas is to speak of the
  West. It covers an enormous region beyond the dependable reach of moist oceanic
  air, occupying the entire Intermontane area and sprawling from Canada to Mexico
  across the western part of the Great Plains. To Americans nurtured in the Humid
  East, this vast territory across the path of all transcontinental travelers has
  been harder to tame than any other—and no region has so gripped the national imagination
  as this fierce and dangerous land.In the Dry West nothing matters more than water.
  Thus, though temperatures may differ radically from place to place, the really important
  regional differences depend overwhelmingly on the degree of aridity, whether an
  area is extremely dry and hence desert or semiarid and therefore steppe.Americans
  of the 19th century were preoccupied by the myth of a Great American Desert, which
  supposedly occupied more than one-third of the entire country. True desert, however,
  is confined to the Southwest, with patchy outliers elsewhere, all without exception
  located in the lowland rain shadows of the Cordillera. Vegetation in these desert
  areas varies between nothing at all (a rare circumstance confined mainly to salt
  flats and sand dunes) to a low cover of scattered woody scrub and short-lived annuals
  that burst into flamboyant bloom after rains. Soils are usually thin, light-coloured,
  and very rich with mineral salts. In some areas wind erosion has removed fine-grained
  material, leaving behind desert pavement, a barren veneer of broken rock.Most of
  the West, however, lies in the semiarid region, in which rainfall is scanty but
  adequate to support a thin cover of short bunchgrass, commonly alternating with
  scrubby brush. Here, as in the desert, soils fall into the large family of the pedocals,
  rich in calcium and other soluble minerals, but in the slightly wetter environments
  of the West, they are enriched with humus from decomposed grass roots. Under the
  proper type of management, these chestnut-coloured steppe soils have the potential
  to be very fertile.Weather in the West resembles that of other dry regions of the
  world, often extreme, violent, and reliably unreliable. Rainfall, for example, obeys
  a cruel natural law: as total precipitation decreases, it becomes more undependable.
  John Steinbeck’s novel The Grapes of Wrath describes the problems of a family enticed
  to the arid frontier of Oklahoma during a wet period only to be driven out by the
  savage drought of the 1930s that turned the western Great Plains into the great
  American Dust Bowl. Temperatures in the West also fluctuate convulsively within
  short periods, and high winds are infamous throughout the region.East of the Rockies
  all climatic boundaries are gradational. None, however, is so important or so imperceptibly
  subtle as the boundary zone that separates the Humid East from the Dry West and
  that alternates unpredictably between arid and humid conditions from year to year.
  Stretching approximately from Texas to North Dakota in an ill-defined band between
  the 95th and 100th meridians, this transitional region deserves separate recognition,
  partly because of its great size, and partly because of the fine balance between
  surplus and deficit rainfall, which produces a unique and valuable combination of
  soils, flora, and fauna. The native vegetation, insofar as it can be reconstructed,
  was prairie, the legendary sea of tall, deep-rooted grass now almost entirely tilled
  and planted to grains. Soils, often of loessial derivation, include the enormously
  productive chernozem (black earth) in the north, with reddish prairie soils of nearly
  equal fertility in the south. Throughout the region temperatures are severely continental,
  with bitterly cold winters in the north and scorching summers everywhere.The western
  edge of the prairie fades gradually into the shortgrass steppe of the High Plains,
  the change a function of diminishing rainfall. The eastern edge, however, represents
  one of the few major discordances between a climatic and biotic boundary in the
  United States, for the grassland penetrates the eastern forest in a great salient
  across humid Illinois and Indiana. Many scholars believe this part of the prairie
  was artificially induced by repeated burning and consequent destruction of the forest
  margins by Indians.Throughout the Cordillera and Intermontane regions, irregular
  topography shatters the grand bioclimatic pattern into an intricate mosaic of tiny
  regions that differ drastically according to elevation and exposure. No small- or
  medium-scale map can accurately record such complexity, and mountainous parts of
  the West are said, noncommittally, to have a “mountain climate.” Lowlands are usually
  dry, but increasing elevation brings lower temperature, decreased evaporation, and—if
  a slope faces prevailing winds—greater precipitation. Soils vary wildly from place
  to place, but vegetation is fairly predictable. From the desert or steppe of intermontane
  valleys, a climber typically ascends into parklike savanna, then through an orderly
  sequence of increasingly humid and boreal forests until, if the range is high enough,
  one reaches the timberline and Arctic tundra. The very highest peaks are snow-capped,
  although permanent glaciers rarely occur outside the cool humid highlands of the
  Pacific Northwest.The dominant features of the vegetation are indicated by the terms
  forest, grassland, desert, and alpine tundra.A coniferous forest of white and red
  pine, hemlock, spruce, jack pine, and balsam fir extends interruptedly in a narrow
  strip near the Canadian border from Maine to Minnesota and southward along the Appalachian
  Mountains. There may be found smaller stands of tamarack, spruce, paper birch, willow,
  alder, and aspen or poplar. Southward, a transition zone of mixed conifers and deciduous
  trees gives way to a hardwood forest of broad-leaved trees. This forest, with varying
  mixtures of maple, oak, ash, locust, linden, sweet gum, walnut, hickory, sycamore,
  beech, and the more southerly tulip tree, once extended uninterruptedly from New
  England to Missouri and eastern Texas. Pines are prominent on the Atlantic and Gulf
  coastal plain and adjacent uplands, often occurring in nearly pure stands called
  pine barrens. Pitch, longleaf, slash, shortleaf, Virginia, and loblolly pines are
  commonest. Hickory and various oaks combine to form a significant part of this forest,
  with magnolia, white cedar, and ash often seen. In the frequent swamps, bald cypress,
  tupelo, and white cedar predominate. Pines, palmettos, and live oaks are replaced
  at the southern tip of Florida by the more tropical royal and thatch palms, figs,
  satinwood, and mangrove.The grasslands occur principally in the Great Plains area
  and extend westward into the intermontane basins and benchlands of the Rocky Mountains.
  Numerous grasses such as buffalo, grama, side oat, bunch, needle, and wheat grass,
  together with many kinds of herbs, make up the plant cover. Coniferous forests cover
  the lesser mountains and high plateaus of the Rockies, Cascades, and Sierra Nevada.
  Ponderosa (yellow) pine, Douglas fir, western red cedar, western larch, white pine,
  lodgepole pine, several spruces, western hemlock, grand fir, red fir, and the lofty
  redwood are the principal trees of these forests. The densest growth occurs west
  of the Cascade and Coast ranges in Washington, Oregon, and northern California,
  where the trees are often 100 feet or more in height. There the forest floor is
  so dark that only ferns, mosses, and a few shade-loving shrubs and herbs may be
  found.Arizona: Saguaro National MonumentEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The alpine
  tundra, located in the coterminous United States only in the mountains above the
  limit of trees, consists principally of small plants that bloom brilliantly for
  a short season. Sagebrush is the most common plant of the arid basins and semideserts
  west of the Rocky Mountains, but juniper, nut pine, and mountain mahogany are often
  found on the slopes and low ridges. The desert, extending from southeastern California
  to Texas, is noted for the many species of cactus, some of which grow to the height
  of trees, and for the Joshua tree and other yuccas, creosote bush, mesquite, and
  acacias.The United States is rich in the variety of its native forest trees, some
  of which, as the species of sequoia, are the most massive known. More than 1,000
  species and varieties have been described, of which almost 200 are of economic value,
  either because of the timber and other useful products that they yield or by reason
  of their importance in forestry.Besides the native flowering plants, estimated at
  between 20,000 to 25,000 species, many hundreds of species introduced from other
  regions—chiefly Europe, Asia, and tropical America—have become naturalized. A large
  proportion of these are common annual weeds of fields, pastures, and roadsides.
  In some districts these naturalized “aliens” constitute 50 percent or more of the
  total plant population.With most of North America, the United States lies in the
  Nearctic faunistic realm, a region containing an assemblage of species similar to
  Eurasia and North Africa but sharply different from the tropical and subtropical
  zones to the south. Main regional differences correspond roughly with primary climatic
  and vegetal patterns. Thus, for example, the animal communities of the Dry West
  differ sharply from those of the Humid East and from those of the Pacific Coast.
  Because animals tend to range over wider areas than plants, faunal regions are generally
  coarser than vegetal regions and harder to delineate sharply.The animal geography
  of the United States, however, is far from a natural pattern, for European settlement
  produced a series of environmental changes that grossly altered the distribution
  of animal communities. First, many species were hunted to extinction or near extinction,
  most conspicuously, perhaps, the American bison, which ranged by the millions nearly
  from coast to coast but now rarely lives outside of zoos and wildlife preserves.
  Second, habitats were upset or destroyed throughout most of the country—forests
  cut, grasslands plowed and overgrazed, and migration paths interrupted by fences,
  railroads, and highways. Third, certain introduced species found hospitable niches
  and, like the English sparrow, spread over huge areas, often preempting the habitats
  of native animals. Fourth, though their effects are not fully understood, chemical
  biocides such as DDT were used for so long and in such volume that they are believed
  at least partly responsible for catastrophic mortality rates among large mammals
  and birds, especially predators high on the food chain. Fifth, there has been a
  gradual northward migration of certain tropical and subtropical insects, birds,
  and mammals, perhaps encouraged by gradual climatic warming. In consequence, many
  native animals have been reduced to tiny fractions of their former ranges or exterminated
  completely, while other animals, both native and introduced, have found the new
  anthropocentric environment well suited to their needs, with explosive effects on
  their populations. The coyote, opossum, armadillo, and several species of deer are
  among the animals that now occupy much larger ranges than they once did.Arrangement
  of the account of the distribution of the fauna according to the climatic and vegetal
  regions has the merit that it can be compared further with the distribution of insects
  and of other invertebrates, some of which may be expected to fall into the same
  patterns as the vertebrates, while others, with different modes or different ages
  of dispersal, have geographic patterns of their own.The transcontinental zone of
  coniferous forest at the north, the taiga, and the tundra zone into which it merges
  at the northern limit of tree growth are strikingly paralleled by similar vertical
  zones in the Rockies, and on Mount Washington in the east, where the area above
  the timberline and below the snow line is often inhabited with tundra animals like
  the ptarmigan and the white Parnassius butterflies, while the spruce and other conifers
  below the timberline form a belt sharply set off from the grassland or hardwood
  forest or desert at still lower altitudes.A whole series of important types of animals
  spread beyond the limits of such regions or zones, sometimes over most of the continent.
  Aquatic animals, in particular, may live equally in forest and plains, in the Gulf
  states, and at the Canadian border. Such widespread animals include the white-tailed
  (Virginia) deer and black bear, the puma (though only in the remotest parts of its
  former range) and bobcat, the river otter (though now rare in inland areas south
  of the Great Lakes) and mink, and the beaver and muskrat. The distinctive coyote
  ranges over all of western North America and eastward as far as Maine. The snapping
  turtle ranges from the Atlantic coast to the Rocky Mountains.In the northern coniferous
  forest zone, or taiga, the relations of animals with European or Eurasian representatives
  are numerous, and this zone is also essentially circumpolar. The relations are less
  close than in the Arctic forms, but the moose, beaver, hare, red fox, otter, wolverine,
  and wolf are recognizably related to Eurasian animals. Even some fishes, like the
  whitefishes (Coregonidae), the yellow perch, and the pike, exhibit this kind of
  Old World–New World relation. A distinctively North American animal in this taiga
  assemblage is the Canadian porcupine.The hardwood forest area of the eastern and
  the southeastern pinelands compose the most important of the faunal regions within
  the United States. A great variety of fishes, amphibians, and reptiles of this region
  have related forms in East Asia, and this pattern of representation is likewise
  found in the flora. This area is rich in catfishes, minnows, and suckers. The curious
  ganoid fishes, the bowfin and the gar, are ancient types. The spoonbill cat, a remarkable
  type of sturgeon in the lower Mississippi, is represented elsewhere in the world
  only in the Yangtze in China. The Appalachian region is headquarters for the salamanders
  of the world, with no less than seven of the eight families of this large group
  of amphibians represented; no other continent has more than three of the eight families
  together. The eellike sirens and amphiumas (congo snakes) are confined to the southeastern
  states. The lungless salamanders of the family Plethodontidae exhibit a remarkable
  variety of genera and a number of species centring in the Appalachians. There is
  a great variety of frogs, and these include tree frogs whose main development is
  South American and Australian. The emydid freshwater turtles of the southeast parallel
  those of East Asia to a remarkable degree, though the genus Clemmys is the only
  one represented in both regions. Much the same is true of the water snakes, pit
  vipers, rat snakes, and green snakes, though still others are peculiarly American.
  The familiar alligator is a form with an Asiatic relative, the only other living
  true alligator being a species in central China.In its mammals and birds the southeastern
  fauna is less sharply distinguished from the life to the north and west and is less
  directly related to that of East Asia. The forest is the home of the white-tailed
  deer, the black bear, the gray fox, the raccoon, and the common opossum. The wild
  turkey and the extinct hosts of the passenger pigeon were characteristic. There
  is a remarkable variety of woodpeckers. The birdlife in general tends to differ
  from that of Eurasia in the presence of birds, like the tanagers, American orioles,
  and hummingbirds, that belong to South American families. Small mammals abound with
  types of the worldwide rodent family Cricetidae, and with distinctive moles and
  shrews.Most distinctive of the grassland animals proper is the American bison (see
  photograph), whose nearly extinct European relative, the wisent, is a forest dweller.
  The most distinctive of the American hoofed animals is the pronghorn, or prongbuck,
  which represents a family intermediate between the deer and the true antelopes in
  that it sheds its horns like a deer but retains the bony horn cores. The pronghorn
  is perhaps primarily a desert mammal, but it formerly ranged widely into the shortgrass
  plains. Everywhere in open country in the West there are conspicuous and distinctive
  rodents. The burrowing pocket gopher is peculiarly American, rarely seen making
  its presence known by pushed-out mounds of earth. The ground squirrels of the genus
  Citellus are related to those of Central Asia, and resemble them in habit; in North
  America the gregarious prairie dog is a closely related form. The American badger
  (see photograph), not especially related to the badger of Europe, has its headquarters
  in the grasslands. The prairie chicken is a bird distinctive of the plains region,
  which is invaded everywhere by birds from both the east and the west.The Southwestern
  deserts are a paradise for reptiles. Distinctive lizards such as the poisonous Gila
  monster abound, and the rattlesnakes, of which only a few species are found elsewhere
  in the United States, are common there. Desert reptile species often range to the
  Pacific Coast and northward into the Great Basin. Noteworthy mammals are the graceful
  bipedal kangaroo rat (almost exlusively nocturnal; see photograph), the ring-tailed
  cat, a relative of the raccoon, and the piglike peccary.The Rocky Mountains and
  other western ranges afford distinctive habitats for rock- and cliff-dwelling hoofed
  animals and rodents. The small pikas, related to the rabbit, inhabit talus areas
  at high altitudes as they do in the mountain ranges of East Asia. Marmots live in
  the Rockies as in the Alps. Every western range formerly had its own race of mountain
  sheep. At the north the Rocky Mountain goat lives at high altitudes—it is more properly
  a goat antelope, related to the takin of the mountains of western China. The dipper,
  remarkable for its habit of feeding in swift-flowing streams, though otherwise a
  bird without special aquatic adaptations, is a Rocky Mountain form with relatives
  in Asia and Europe.In the Pacific region the extremely distinctive primitive tailed
  frog Ascaphus, which inhabits icy mountain brooks, represents a family by itself,
  perhaps more nearly related to the frogs of New Zealand than to more familiar types.
  The Cascades and Sierras form centres for salamanders of the families Ambystomoidae
  and Plethodontidae second only to the Appalachians, and there are also distinctive
  newts. The burrowing lizards, of the well-defined family Anniellidae, are found
  only in a limited area in coastal California. The only family of birds distinctive
  of North America, that of the wren-tits, Chamaeidae, is found in the chaparral of
  California. The mountain beaver, or sewellel (which is not at all beaverlike), is
  likewise a type peculiar to North America, confined to the Cascades and Sierras,
  and there are distinct kinds of moles in the Pacific area.The mammals of the two
  coasts are strikingly different, though true seals (the harbour seal and the harp
  seal) are found on both. The sea lions, with longer necks and with projecting ears,
  are found only in the Pacific—the California sea lion, the more northern Steller’s
  sea lion, and the fur seal. On the East Coast the larger rivers of Florida are inhabited
  by the Florida manatee, or sea cow, a close relative of the more widespread and
  more distinctively marine West Indian species.United States: population densityEncyclopædia
  Britannica, Inc.Although the land that now constitutes the United States was occupied
  and much affected by diverse Indian cultures over many millennia, these pre-European
  settlement patterns have had virtually no impact upon the contemporary nation—except
  locally, as in parts of New Mexico. A benign habitat permitted a huge contiguous
  tract of settled land to materialize across nearly all the eastern half of the United
  States and within substantial patches of the West. The vastness of the land, the
  scarcity of labour, and the abundance of migratory opportunities in a land replete
  with raw physical resources contributed to exceptional human mobility and a quick
  succession of ephemeral forms of land use and settlement. Human endeavours have
  greatly transformed the landscape, but such efforts have been largely destructive.
  Most of the pre-European landscape in the United States was so swiftly and radically
  altered that it is difficult to conjecture intelligently about its earlier appearance.The
  overall impression of the settled portion of the American landscape, rural or urban,
  is one of disorder and incoherence, even in areas of strict geometric survey. The
  individual landscape unit is seldom in visual harmony with its neighbour, so that,
  however sound in design or construction the single structure may be, the general
  effect is untidy. These attributes have been intensified by the acute individualism
  of the American, vigorous speculation in land and other commodities, a strongly
  utilitarian attitude toward the land and the treasures above and below it, and government
  policy and law. The landscape is also remarkable for its extensive transportation
  facilities, which have greatly influenced the configuration of the land.Another
  special characteristic of American settlement, one that became obvious only by the
  mid-20th century, is the convergence of rural and urban modes of life. The farmsteads—and
  rural folk in general—have become increasingly urbanized, and agricultural operations
  have become more automated, while the metropolis grows more gelatinous, unfocused,
  and pseudo-bucolic along its margins.Patterns of rural settlement indicate much
  about the history, economy, society, and minds of those who created them as well
  as about the land itself. The essential design of rural activity in the United States
  bears a strong family resemblance to that of other neo-European lands, such as Canada,
  Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, or tsarist Siberia—places that
  have undergone rapid occupation and exploitation by immigrants intent upon short-term
  development and enrichment. In all such areas, under novel social and political
  conditions and with a relative abundance of territory and physical resources, ideas
  and institutions derived from a relatively stable medieval or early modern Europe
  have undergone major transformation. Further, these are nonpeasant countrysides,
  alike in having failed to achieve the intimate symbiosis of people and habitat,
  the humanized rural landscapes characteristic of many relatively dense, stable,
  earthbound communities in parts of Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America.From
  the beginning the prevalent official policy of the British (except between 1763
  and 1776) and then of the U.S. government was to promote agricultural and other
  settlement—to push the frontier westward as fast as physical and economic conditions
  permitted. The British crown’s grants of large, often vaguely specified tracts to
  individual proprietors or companies enabled the grantees to draw settlers by the
  sale or lease of land at attractive prices or even by outright gift.Of the numerous
  attempts at group colonization, the most notable effort was the theocratic and collectivist
  New England town that flourished, especially in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and
  New Hampshire, during the first century of settlement. The town, the basic unit
  of government and comparable in area to townships in other states, allotted both
  rural and village parcels to single families by group decision. Contrary to earlier
  scholarly belief, in all but a few cases settlement was spatially dispersed in the
  socially cohesive towns, at least until about 1800. The relatively concentrated
  latter-day villages persist today as amoeba-like entities straggling along converging
  roads, neither fully rural nor agglomerated in form. The only latter-day settlement
  experiment of notable magnitude to achieve enduring success was a series of Mormon
  settlements in the Great Basin region of Utah and adjacent states, with their tightly
  concentrated farm villages reminiscent of the New England model. Other efforts have
  been made along ethnic, religious, or political lines, but success has been at best
  brief and fragile.With the coming of independence and after complex negotiations,
  the original 13 states surrendered to the new national government nearly all their
  claims to the unsettled western lands beyond their boundaries. Some tracts, however,
  were reserved for disposal to particular groups. Thus, the Western Reserve of northeastern
  Ohio gave preferential treatment to natives of Connecticut, while the military tracts
  in Ohio and Indiana were used as bonus payments to veterans of the American Revolution.A
  federally administered national domain was created, to which the great bulk of the
  territory acquired in 1803 in the Louisiana Purchase and later beyond the Mississippi
  and in 1819 in Florida was consigned. The only major exceptions were the public
  lands of Texas, which were left within that state’s jurisdiction; such earlier French
  and Spanish land grants as were confirmed, often after tortuous litigation; and
  some Indian lands. In sharp contrast to the slipshod methods of colonial land survey
  and disposal, the federal land managers expeditiously surveyed, numbered, and mapped
  their territory in advance of settlement, beginning with Ohio in the 1780s, then
  sold or deeded it to settlers under inviting terms at a number of regional land
  offices.The design universally followed in the new survey system (except within
  the French, Spanish, and Indian grants) was a simple, efficient rectangular scheme.
  Townships were laid out as blocks, each six by six miles in size, oriented with
  the compass directions. Thirty-six sections, each one square mile, or 640 acres
  (260 hectares), in size, were designated within each township; and public roads
  were established along section lines and, where needed, along half-section lines.
  At irregular intervals, offsets in survey lines and roads were introduced to allow
  for the Earth’s curvature. Individual property lines were coincident with, or parallel
  to, survey lines, and this pervasive rectangularity generally carried over into
  the geometry of fields and fences or into the townsites later superimposed upon
  the basic rural survey.This all-encompassing checkerboard pattern is best appreciated
  from an airplane window over Iowa or Kansas. There, one sees few streams or other
  natural features and few diagonal highways or railroads interrupting the overwhelming
  squareness of the landscape. A systematic rectangular layout, rather less rigorous
  in form, also appears in much of Texas and in those portions of Maine, western New
  York and Pennsylvania, and southern Georgia that were settled after the 1780s.Since
  its formation, Congress has enacted a series of complex schemes for distribution
  of the national domain. The most famous of these plans was the Homestead Act of
  1862, which offered title to 160 acres to individual settlers, subject only to residence
  for a certain period of time and to the making of minimal improvements to the land
  thus acquired. The legal provisions of such acts have varied with time as the nature
  of farming technology and of the remaining lands have changed, but their general
  effect has been to perpetuate the Jeffersonian ideal of a republic in which yeoman
  farmers own and till self-sufficient properties.The program was successful in providing
  private owners with relatively choice lands, aside from parcels reserved for schools
  and various township and municipal uses. More than one-third of the national territory,
  however, is still owned by federal and state governments, with much of this land
  in forest and wildlife preserves. A large proportion of this land is in the West
  and is unsuited for intensive agriculture or grazing because of the roughness, dryness,
  or salinity of the terrain; much of it is leased out for light grazing or for timber
  cutting.During the classic period of American rural life, around 1900, the typical
  American lived or worked on a farm or was economically dependent upon farmers. In
  contrast to rural life in many other parts of the world, the farm family lived on
  an isolated farmstead some distance from town and often from farm neighbours; its
  property averaged less than one-quarter square mile. This farmstead varied in form
  and content with local tradition and economy. In particular, barn types were localized—for
  example, the tobacco barns of the South, the great dairy barns of Wisconsin, or
  the general-purpose forebay barns of southeastern Pennsylvania—as were modes of
  fencing. In general, however, the farmstead contained dwelling, barn, storage and
  sheds for small livestock and equipment, a small orchard, and a kitchen garden.
  A woodlot might be found in the least-accessible or least-fertile part of the farm.Successions
  of such farms were connected with one another and with the towns by means of a dense,
  usually rectangular lattice of roads, largely unimproved at the time. The hamlets,
  villages, and smaller cities were arrayed at relatively regular intervals, with
  size and affluence determined in large part by the presence and quality of rail
  service or status as the county seat. But, among people who have been historically
  rural, individualistic, and antiurban in bias, many services normally located in
  urban places might be found in rustic settings. Thus, much retail business was transacted
  by means of itinerant peddlers, while small shops for the fabrication, distribution,
  or repair of various items were often located in isolated farmsteads, as were many
  post offices.Social activity also tended to be widely dispersed among numerous rural
  churches, schools, or grange halls; and the climactic event of the year might well
  be the county fair, political rally, or religious encampment—again on a rural site.
  Not the least symptomatic sign of the strong tendency toward spatial isolation are
  the countless family burial plots or community cemeteries so liberally distributed
  across the countryside.There has been much regional variation among smaller villages
  and hamlets, but such phenomena have received relatively little attention from students
  of American culture or geography. The distinctive New England village, of course,
  is generally recognized and cherished: it consists of a loose clustering of white
  frame buildings, including a church (usually Congregationalist or Unitarian), town
  hall, shops, and stately homes with tall shade trees around the central green, or
  commons—a grassy expanse that may contain a bandstand and monuments or flowers.
  Derivative village forms were later carried westward to sections of the northern
  Midwest.Less widely known but equally distinctive is the town morphology characteristic
  of the Midland, or Pennsylvanian, culture area and most fully developed in southeastern
  and central Pennsylvania and Piedmont Maryland. It differs totally from the New
  England model in density, building materials, and general appearance. Closely packed,
  often contiguous buildings—mostly brick, but sometimes stone, frame, or stucco—abut
  directly on a sidewalk, which is often paved with brick and usually thickly planted
  with maple, sycamore, or other shade trees. Such towns are characteristically linear
  in plan, have dwellings intermingled with other types of buildings, have only one
  or two principal streets, and may radiate outward from a central square lined with
  commercial and governmental structures.Midwest States: History and PeopleEncyclopædia
  Britannica, Inc.The most characteristic U.S. small town is the one whose pattern
  evolved in the Midwest. Its simple scheme is usually based on the grid plan. Functions
  are rigidly segregated spatially, with the central business district, consisting
  of closely packed two- or three-story brick buildings, limited exclusively to commercial
  and administrative activity. The residences, generally set well back within spacious
  lots, are peripheral in location, as are most rail facilities, factories, and warehouses.Even
  the modest urbanization of the small town came late to the South. Most urban functions
  long were spatially dispersed—almost totally so in the early Chesapeake Bay country
  or North Carolina—or were performed entirely by the larger plantations dominating
  the economic life of much of the region. When city and town began to materialize
  in the 19th and 20th centuries, they tended to follow the Midwestern model in layout.Although
  quite limited in geographic area, the characteristic villages of the Mormon and
  Hispanic-American districts are of considerable interest. The Mormon settlement
  uncompromisingly followed the ecclesiastically imposed grid plan composed of square
  blocks, each with perhaps only four very large house lots, and the block surrounded
  by extremely wide streets. Those villages in New Mexico in which population and
  culture were derived from Old Mexico were often built according to the standard
  Latin-American plan. The distinctive feature is a central plaza dominated by a Roman
  Catholic church and encircled by low stone or adobe buildings.The United States
  has had little success in achieving or maintaining the ideal of the family farm.
  Through purchase, inheritance, leasing, and other means, some of dubious legality,
  smaller properties have been merged into much larger entities. By the late 1980s,
  for example, when the average farm size had surpassed 460 acres, farms containing
  2,000 or more acres accounted for almost half of all farmland and 20 percent of
  the cropland harvested, even though they comprised less than 3 percent of all farms.
  At the other extreme were those 60 percent of all farms that contained fewer than
  180 acres and reported less than 15 percent of cropland harvested. This trend toward
  fewer but larger farms has continued.The huge, heavily capitalized “neoplantation,”
  essentially a factory in the field, is especially conspicuous in parts of California,
  Arizona, and the Mississippi Delta, but examples can be found in any state. There
  are also many smaller but intensive operations that call for large investments and
  advanced managerial skills. This trend toward large-scale, capital-intensive farm
  enterprise has been paralleled by a sharp drop in rural farm population—a slump
  from the all-time high of some 32,000,000 in the early 20th century to about 5,000,000
  in the late 1980s; but even in 1940, when farm folk still numbered more than 30,000,000,
  nearly 40 percent of farm operators were tenants, and another 10 percent were only
  partial owners.As the agrarian population has dwindled, so too has its immediate
  impact lessened, though less swiftly, in economic and political matters. The rural
  United States, however, has been the source of many of the nation’s values and images.
  The United States has become a highly urbanized, technologically advanced society
  far removed in daily life from cracker barrel, barnyard, corral, or logging camp.
  Although Americans have gravitated, sometimes reluctantly, to the big city, in the
  daydreams and assumptions that guide many sociopolitical decisions, the memory of
  a rapidly vanishing agrarian America is well noted. This is revealed not only in
  the works of contemporary novelists, poets, and painters but also throughout the
  popular arts: in movies, television, soap operas, folklore, country music, political
  oratory, and in much leisure activity.Since about 1920 more genuine change has occurred
  in American rural life than during the preceding three centuries of European settlement
  in North America. Although the basic explanation is the profound social and technological
  transformations engulfing most of the world, the most immediate agent of change
  has been the internal-combustion engine. The automobile, truck, bus, and paved highway
  have more than supplanted a moribund passenger and freight railroad system. While
  many local rail depots have been boarded up and scores of secondary lines have been
  abandoned, hundreds of thousands of miles of old dirt roads have been paved, and
  a vast system of interstate highways has been constructed to connect major cities
  in a single nonstop network. The net result has been a shrinking of travel time
  and an increase in miles traveled for the individual driver, rural or urban.Small
  towns in the United States have undergone a number of changes. Before 1970 towns
  near highways and urban centres generally prospered; while in the less-fortunate
  towns, where the residents lingered on for the sake of relatively cheap housing,
  downtown businesses often became extinct. From the late 1960s until about 1981 the
  rural and small-town population grew at a faster rate than the metropolitan population,
  the so-called metro–nonmetro turnaround, thus reversing more than a century of relatively
  greater urban growth. Subsequent evidence, however, suggests an approach toward
  equilibrium between the urban and rural sectors.As Americans have become increasingly
  mobile, the visual aspect of rural America has altered drastically. The highway
  has become the central route, and many of the functions once confined to the local
  town or city now stretch for many miles along major roads.The metropolitanization
  of life in the United States has not been limited to city, suburb, or exurb; it
  now involves most of the rural area and population. The result has been the decline
  of local crafts and regional peculiarities, quite visibly in such items as farm
  implements, fencing, silos, and housing and in commodities such as clothing or bread.
  In many ways, the countryside is now economically dependent on the city.The city
  dweller is the dominant consumer for products other than those of field, quarry,
  or lumber mill; and city location tends to determine patterns of rural economy rather
  than the reverse. During weekends and the vacation seasons, swarms of city folk
  stream out to second homes in the countryside and to campgrounds, ski runs, beaches,
  boating areas, or hunting and fishing tracts. For many large rural areas, recreation
  is the principal source of income and employment; and such areas as northern New
  England and upstate New York have become playgrounds and sylvan refuges for many
  urban residents.The larger cities reach far into the countryside for their vital
  supplies of water and energy. There is an increasing reliance upon distant coalfields
  to provide fuel for electrical power plants, and cities have gone far afield in
  seeking out rural disposal sites for their ever-growing volumes of garbage.The majority
  of the rural population now lives within daily commuting range of a sizable city.
  This enables many farm residents to operate their farms while, at the same time,
  working part- or full-time at a city job, and it thus helps to prevent the drastic
  decline in rural population that has occurred in remoter parts of the country. Similarly,
  many small towns within the shadow of a metropolis, with fewer and fewer farmers
  to service, have become dormitory satellites, serving residents from nearby cities
  and suburbs.Northeast USA: History and PeopleEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The United
  States has moved from a predominantly rural settlement into an urban society. In
  so doing, it has followed the general path that other advanced nations have traveled
  and one along which developing nations have begun to hasten. About three-fourths
  of the population live clustered within officially designated urban places and urbanized
  areas, which account for less than 2 percent of the national territory. At least
  another 15 percent live in dispersed residences that are actually urban in economic
  or social orientation.Although more than 95 percent of the population was rural
  during the colonial period and for the first years of independence, cities were
  crucial elements in the settlement system from the earliest days. Boston; New Amsterdam
  (New York City); Jamestown, Va.; Charleston, S.C.; and Philadelphia were founded
  at the same time as the colonies they served. Like nearly all other North American
  colonial towns of consequence, they were ocean ports. Until at least the beginning
  of the 20th century the historical geography of U.S. cities was intimately related
  with that of successive transportation systems. The location of successful cities
  with respect to the areas they served, as well as their internal structure, was
  determined largely by the nature of these systems.The colonial cities acted as funnels
  for the collection and shipment of farm and forest products and other raw materials
  from the interior to trading partners in Europe, the Caribbean, or Africa and for
  the return flow of manufactured goods and other locally scarce items, as well as
  immigrants. Such cities were essentially marts and warehouses, and only minimal
  attention was given to social, military, educational, or religious functions. The
  inadequacy and high cost of overland traffic dictated sites along major ocean embayments
  or river estuaries; the only pre-1800 nonports worthy of notice were Lancaster and
  York, both in Pennsylvania, and Williamsburg, Va. With the populating of the interior
  and the spread of a system of canals and improved roads, such new cities as Pittsburgh,
  Pa.; Cincinnati, Ohio; Buffalo, N.Y.; and St. Louis, Mo., mushroomed at junctures
  between various routes or at which modes of transport were changed. Older ocean
  ports, such as New Castle, Del.; Newport, R.I.; Charleston, S.C.; Savannah, Ga.;
  and Portland, Maine, whose locations prevented them from serving large hinterlands,
  tended to stagnate.From about 1850 to 1920 the success of new cities and the further
  growth of older ones in large part were dependent on their location within the new
  steam railroad system and on their ability to dominate a large tributary territory.
  Such waterside rail hubs as Buffalo; Toledo, Ohio; Chicago; and San Francisco gained
  population and wealth rapidly, while such offspring of the rail era as Atlanta,
  Ga.; Indianapolis, Ind.; Minneapolis, Minn.; Fort Worth, Texas; and Tacoma, Wash.,
  also grew dramatically. Much of the rapid industrialization of the 19th and early
  20th centuries occurred in places already favoured by water or rail transport systems;
  but in some instances, such as in the cities of northeastern Pennsylvania’s anthracite
  region, some New England mill towns, and the textile centres of the Carolina and
  Virginia Piedmont, manufacturing brought about rapid urbanization and the consequent
  attraction of transport facilities. The extraction of gold, silver, copper, coal,
  iron, and, in the 20th century, gas and oil led to rather ephemeral centres—unless
  these places were able to capitalize on local or regional advantages other than
  minerals.A strong early start, whatever the inital economic base may have been,
  was often the key factor in competition among cities. With sufficient early momentum,
  urban capital and population tended to expand almost automatically. The point is
  illustrated perfectly by the larger cities of the northeastern seaboard, from Portland,
  Maine, through Baltimore, Md. The nearby physical wealth is poor to mediocre, and
  they are now far off-centre on the national map; but a prosperous mercantile beginning,
  good land and sea connections with distant places, and a rich local accumulation
  of talent, capital, and initiative were sufficient to bring about the growth of
  one of the world’s largest concentrations of industry, commerce, and people.The
  pre-1900 development of the American city was almost completely a chronicle of the
  economics of the production, collection, and distribution of physical commodities
  and basic services dictated by geography, but there have been striking deviations
  from this pattern. The physical determinants of urban location and growth have given
  way to social factors. Increasingly, the most successful cities are oriented toward
  the more advanced modes for the production and consumption of services, specifically
  the knowledge, managerial, and recreational industries. The largest cities have
  become more dependent upon corporate headquarters, communications, and the manipulation
  of information for their sustenance. Washington, D.C., is the most obvious example
  of a metropolis in which government and ancillary activities have been the spur
  for vigorous growth; but almost all of the state capitals have displayed a similar
  demographic and economic vitality. Further, urban centres that contain a major college
  or university often have enjoyed remarkable expansion.With the coming of relative
  affluence and abundant leisure to the population and a decrease of labour input
  in industrial processes, a new breed of cities has sprouted across the land: those
  that cater to the pleasure-seeker, vacationer, and the retired—for example, the
  young, flourishing cities of Florida or Nevada and many locations in California,
  Arizona, and Colorado.The automobile as a means of personal transportation was developed
  about the time of World War I, and the American city was catapulted into a radically
  new period, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the further evolution of physical
  form and function. The size, density, and internal structure of the city were previously
  constrained by the limitations of the pedestrian and early mass-transit systems.
  Only the well-to-do could afford horse and carriage or a secluded villa in the countryside.
  Cities were relatively small and compact, with a single clearly defined centre,
  and they grew by accretion along their edges, without any significant spatial hiatuses
  except where commuter railroads linked outlying towns to the largest of metropolises.
  Workers living beyond the immediate vicinity of their work had to locate within
  reach of the few horse-drawn omnibuses or the later electric street railways.The
  universality of the automobile, even among the less affluent, and the parallel proliferation
  of service facilities and highways greatly loosened and fragmented the American
  city, which spread over surrounding rural lands. Older, formerly autonomous towns
  grew swiftly. Many towns became satellites of the larger city or were absorbed.
  Many suburbs and subdivisions arose with single-family homes on lots larger than
  had been possible for the ordinary householder in the city. These communities were
  almost totally dependent on the highway for the flow of commuters, goods, and services,
  and many were located in splendid isolation, separated by tracts of farmland, brush,
  or forest from other such developments. At the major interchanges of the limited-access
  highways, a new form of agglomerated settlement sprang up. In a further elaboration
  of this trend, many larger cities have been girdled by a set of mushrooming complexes.
  These creations of private enterprise embody a novel concept of urban existence:
  a metropolitan module no longer reliant on the central city or its downtown. Usually
  anchored on a cluster of shopping malls and office parks, these “hypersuburbs,”
  whose residents and employees circulate freely within the outer metropolitan ring,
  offer virtually all of the social and economic facilities needed for the modern
  life-style.The outcome has been a broad, ragged, semiurbanized belt of land surrounding
  each city, large or small, and quite often blending imperceptibly into the suburban-exurban
  halo encircling a neighbouring metropolitan centre. There is a great similarity
  in the makeup and general appearance of all such tracts: the planless intermixture
  of scraps of the rural landscape with the fragments of the scattered metropolis;
  the randomly distributed subdivisions or single homes; the vast shopping centres,
  the large commercial cemeteries, drive-in theatres, junkyards, and golf courses
  and other recreational enterprises; and the regional or metropolitan airport, often
  with its own cluster of factories, warehouses, or travel-oriented businesses. The
  traditional city—unitary, concentric in form, with a single well-defined middle—has
  been replaced by a relatively amorphous, polycentric metropolitan sprawl.The inner
  city of a large U.S. metropolitan area displays some traits that are common to the
  larger centres of all advanced nations. A central business district, almost always
  the oldest section of the city, is surrounded by a succession of roughly circular
  zones, each distinctive in economic and social-ethnic character. The symmetry of
  this scheme is distorted by the irregularities of surface and drainage or the effects
  of radial highways and railroads. Land is most costly, and hence land use is most
  intensive, toward the centre. Major business, financial and governmental offices,
  department stores, and specialty shops dominate the downtown, which is usually fringed
  by a band of factories and warehouses. The outer parts of the city, like the suburbs,
  are mainly residential.With some exceptions—e.g., large apartment complexes in downtown
  Chicago—people do not reside in the downtown areas, and there is a steady downward
  gradient in population density per unit area (and more open land and single-family
  residences) as one moves from the inner city toward the open country. Conversely,
  there is a general rise in income and social status with increasing distance from
  the core. The sharply defined immigrant neighbourhoods of the 19th century generally
  persist in a somewhat diluted form, though specific ethnic groups may have shifted
  their location. Later migrant groups, notably Southern blacks and Latin Americans,
  generally dominate the more run-down neighbourhoods of the inner cities.American
  cities, more so than the small-town or agrarian landscape, tend to be the product
  of a particular period rather than of location. The relatively venerable centres
  of the Eastern Seaboard—Boston; Philadelphia; Baltimore, Md.; Albany, N.Y.; Chester,
  Pa.; Alexandria, Va.; or Georgetown (a district of Washington, D.C.), for example—are
  virtual replicas of the fashionable European models of their early period rather
  than the fruition of a regional culture, unlike New Orleans and Santa Fe, N.M.,
  which reflect other times and regions. The townscapes of Pittsburgh; Detroit, Mich.;
  Chicago; and Denver, Colo., depict national modes of thought and the technological
  development of their formative years, just as Dallas, Texas; Las Vegas, Nev.; San
  Diego, Calif.; Tucson, Ariz.; and Albuquerque, N.M., proclaim contemporary values
  and gadgetry more than any local distinctiveness. When strong-minded city founders
  instituted a highly individual plan and their successors managed to preserve it—as,
  for example, in Savannah, Ga.; Washington, D.C.; and Salt Lake City, Utah—or when
  there is a happy combination of a spectacular site and appreciative residents—as
  in San Francisco or Seattle, Wash.—a genuine individuality does seem to emerge.
  Such an identity also may develop where immigration has been highly selective, as
  in such places as Miami, Fla.; Phoenix, Ariz.; and Los Angeles.As a group, U.S.
  cities differ from cities in other countries in both type and degree. The national
  political structure, the social inclinations of the people, and the strong outward
  surge of urban development have led to the political fragmentation of metropolises
  that socially and economically are relatively cohesive units. The fact that a single
  metropolitan area may sprawl across numerous incorporated towns and cities, several
  townships, and two or more counties and states has a major impact upon both its
  appearance and the way it functions. Not the least of these effects is a dearth
  of overall physical and social planning (or its ineffectuality when attempted),
  and the rather chaotic, inharmonious appearance of both inner-city and peripheral
  zones painfully reflects the absence of any effective collective action concerning
  such matters.The American city is a place of sharp transitions. Construction, demolition,
  and reconstruction go on almost ceaselessly, though increasing thought has been
  given to preserving monuments and buildings. From present evidence, it would be
  impossible to guess that New York City and Albany date from the 1620s or that Detroit
  was founded in 1701. Preservation and restoration do occur, but often only when
  it makes sense in terms of tourist revenue. Physical and social blight has reached
  epidemic proportions in the slum areas of the inner city; but, despite the wholesale
  razing of such areas and the subsequent urban-renewal projects (sometimes as apartment
  or commercial developments for the affluent), the belief has become widespread that
  the ills of the U.S. city are incurable, especially with the increasing flight of
  capital, tax revenue, and the more highly educated, affluent elements of the population
  to suburban areas and the spatial and political polarization of whites and nonwhites.In
  the central sections of U.S. cities, there is little sense of history or continuity;
  instead, one finds evidence of the dominance of the engineering mentality and of
  the credo that the business of the city is business. Commercial and administrative
  activities are paramount, and usually there is little room for church buildings
  or for parks or other nonprofit enterprises. The role of the cathedral, so central
  in the medieval European city, is filled by a U.S. invention serving both utilitarian
  and symbolic purposes, the skyscraper. Some cities have felt the need for other
  bold secular monuments; hence the Gateway Arch looming over St. Louis, Seattle’s
  Space Needle, and Houston’s Astrodome. Future archaeologists may well conclude from
  their excavations that American society was ruled by an oligarchy of highway engineers,
  architects, and bulldozer operators. The great expressways converging upon, or looping,
  the downtown area and the huge amount of space devoted to parking lots and garages
  are even more impressive than the massive surgery executed upon U.S. cities a century
  ago to hack out room for railroad terminals and marshaling yards.Within many urban
  sites there has been radical physical transformation of shoreline, drainage systems,
  and land surface that would be difficult to match elsewhere in the world. Thus,
  in their physical lineaments, Manhattan and inner Boston bear scant resemblance
  to the landscapes seen by their initial settlers. The surface of downtown Chicago
  has been raised several feet above its former swamp level, the city’s lakefront
  extensively reshaped, and the flow of the Chicago River reversed. Los Angeles, notorious
  for its disregard of the environment, has its concrete arroyo bottoms, terraced
  hillsides and landslides, and its own artificial microclimate.The unprecedented
  outward sprawl of American urban settlement has created some novel settlement forms,
  for the quantitative change has been so great as to induce qualitative transformation.
  The conurbation—a territorial coalescence of two or more sizable cities whose peripheral
  zones have grown together—may have first appeared in early 19th-century Europe.
  There are major examples in Great Britain, the Low Countries, and Germany, as well
  as in Japan.Nothing elsewhere, however, rivals in size and complexity the aptly
  named megalopolis, that supercity stretching along the Atlantic from Portland, Maine,
  past Richmond, Va. Other large conurbations include, in the Great Lakes region,
  one centred on Chicago and containing large slices of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Indiana;
  another based in Detroit, embracing large parts of Michigan and Ohio and reaching
  into Canada; and a third stretching from Buffalo through Cleveland and back to Pittsburgh.
  All three are reaching toward one another and may form another megalopolis that,
  in turn, may soon be grafted onto the seaboard megalopolis by a corridor through
  central New York state.Another example of a growing megalopolis is the huge southern
  California conurbation reaching from Santa Barbara, through a dominating Los Angeles,
  to the Mexican border. The solid strip of urban territory that lines the eastern
  shore of Puget Sound is a smaller counterpart. Quite exceptional in form is the
  slender linear multicity occupying Florida’s Atlantic coastline, from Jacksonville
  to Miami, and the loose swarm of medium-sized cities clustering along the Southern
  Piedmont, from south-central Virginia to Birmingham, Ala.; also of note are the
  Texas cities of Dallas–Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio, which have formed a
  rapidly growing—though discontinuous—urbanized triangle.One of the few predictions
  that seem safe in so dynamic and innovative a land as the United States is that,
  unless severe and painful controls are placed on land use, the shape of the urban
  environment will be increasingly megalopolitan: a small set of great constellations
  of polycentric urban zones, each complexly interlocked socially and physically with
  its neighbours.The differences among America’s traditional regions, or culture areas,
  tend to be slight and shallow as compared with such areas in most older, more stable
  countries. The muted, often subtle nature of interregional differences can be ascribed
  to the relative newness of American settlement, a perpetually high degree of mobility,
  a superb communications system, and the galloping centralization of economy and
  government. It might even be argued that some of these regions are quaint vestiges
  of a vanishing past, of interest only to antiquarians.Yet, in spite of the nationwide
  standardization in many areas of American thought and behaviour, the lingering effects
  of the older culture areas do remain potent. In the case of the South, for example,
  the differences helped to precipitate the gravest political crisis and bloodiest
  military conflict in the nation’s history. More than a century after the Civil War,
  the South remains a powerful entity in political, economic, and social terms, and
  its peculiar status is recognized in religious, educational, athletic, and literary
  circles.Even more intriguing is the appearance of a series of essentially 20th-century
  regions. Southern California is the largest and perhaps the most distinctive region,
  and its special culture has attracted large numbers of immigrants to the state.
  Similar trends are visible in southern Florida; in Texas, whose mystique has captured
  the national imagination; and to a certain degree in the more ebullient regions
  of New Mexico and Arizona as well. At the metropolitan level, it is difficult to
  believe that such distinctive cities as San Francisco, Las Vegas, Dallas, Tucson,
  and Seattle have become like all other American cities. A detailed examination,
  however, would show significant if sometimes subtle interregional differences in
  terms of language, religion, diet, folklore, folk architecture and handicrafts,
  political behaviour, social etiquette, and a number of other cultural categories.A
  multitiered hierarchy of culture areas might be postulated for the United States;
  but the most interesting levels are, first, the nation as a whole and, second, the
  five to 10 large subnational regions, each embracing several states or major portions
  thereof. There is a remarkably close coincidence between the political United States
  and the cultural United States. Crossing into Mexico, the traveler passes across
  a cultural chasm. If the contrasts are less dramatic between the two sides of the
  U.S.-Canadian boundary, they are nonetheless real, especially to the Canadian. Erosion
  of the cultural barrier has been largely limited to the area that stretches from
  northern New York state to Aroostook county, Maine. There, a vigorous demographic
  and cultural immigration by French-Canadians has gone far toward eradicating international
  differences.While the international boundaries act as a cultural container, the
  interstate boundaries are curiously irrelevant. Even when the state had a strong
  autonomous early existence—as happened with Massachusetts, Virginia, or Pennsylvania—subsequent
  economic and political forces have tended to wash away such initial identities.
  Actually, it could be argued that the political divisions of the 48 coterminous
  states are anachronistic in the context of contemporary socioeconomic and cultural
  forces. Partially convincing cases might be built for equating Utah and Texas with
  their respective culture areas because of exceptional historical and physical circumstances,
  or perhaps Oklahoma, given its very late European occupation and its dubious distinction
  as the territory to which exiled Indian tribes of the East were relegated. In most
  instances, however, the states either contain two or more distinctly different culture
  and political areas or fragments thereof or are part of a much larger single culture
  area. Thus sharp North–South dichotomies characterize California, Missouri, Illinois,
  Indiana, Ohio, and Florida, while Tennessee advertises that there are really three
  Tennessees. In Virginia the opposing cultural forces were so strong that actual
  fission took place in 1863 (with the admission to the Union of West Virginia) along
  one of those rare interstate boundaries that approximate a genuine cultural divide.Much
  remains to be learned about the cause and effect relations between economic and
  culture areas in the United States. If the South or New England could at one time
  be correlated with a specific economic system, this is no longer easy to do. Cultural
  systems appear to respond more slowly to agents of change than do economic or urban
  systems. Thus the Manufacturing Belt, a core region for many social and economic
  activities, now spans parts of four traditional culture areas—New England, the Midland,
  the Midwest, and the northern fringes of the South. The great urban sprawl, from
  southern Maine to central Virginia, blithely ignores the cultural slopes that are
  still visible in its more rural tracts.The culture areas of the United States are
  generally European in origin, the result of importing European colonists and ways
  of life and the subsequent adaptation of social groups to new habitats. The aboriginal
  cultures have had relatively little influence on the nation’s modern culture. In
  the Southwestern and the indistinct Oklahoman subregions, the Indian element merits
  consideration only as one of several ingredients making up the regional mosaic.
  With some exceptions, the map of American culture areas in the East can be explained
  in terms of the genesis, development, and expansion of the three principal colonial
  cultural hearths along the Atlantic seaboard. Each was basically British in character,
  but their personalities remain distinct because of, first, different sets of social
  and political conditions during the critical period of first effective settlement
  and, second, local physical and economic circumstances. The cultural gradients between
  them tend to be much steeper and the boundaries more distinct than is true for the
  remainder of the nation.United States: New EnglandEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.New
  England was the dominant region during the century of rapid expansion following
  the American Revolution and not merely in terms of demographic or economic expansion.
  In social and cultural life—in education, politics, theology, literature, science,
  architecture, and the more advanced forms of mechanical and social technology—the
  area exercised its primacy. New England was the leading source of ideas and styles
  for the nation from about 1780 to 1880; it furnishes an impressive example of the
  capacity of strongly motivated communities to rise above the constraints of a harsh
  environment.During its first two centuries, New England had an unusually homogeneous
  population. With some exceptions, the British immigrants shared the same nonconformist
  religious beliefs, language, social organization, and general outlook. A distinctive
  regional culture took form, most noticeably in terms of dialect, town morphology,
  and folk architecture. The personality of the people also took on a regional coloration
  both in folklore and in actuality; there is sound basis for the belief that the
  traditional New England Yankee is self-reliant, thrifty, inventive, and enterprising.
  The influx of immigrants that began in the 1830s diluted and altered the New England
  identity, but much of its early personality survived.By virtue of location, wealth,
  and seniority, the Boston metropolitan area has become the cultural economic centre
  of New England. This sovereignty is shared to some degree, however, with two other
  old centres, the lower Connecticut Valley and the Narragansett Bay region of Rhode
  Island.The early westward demographic and ideological expansion of New England was
  so influential that it is justifiable to call New York, northern New Jersey, northern
  Pennsylvania, and much of the Upper Midwest “New England Extended.” Further, the
  energetic endeavours of New England whalers, merchants, and missionaries had a considerable
  impact on the cultures of Hawaii, various other Pacific isles, and several points
  in the Caribbean. New Englanders also were active in the Americanization of early
  Oregon and Washington, with results that are still visible. Later, the overland
  diffusion of New England natives and practices meant a recognizable New England
  character not only for the Upper Midwest, from Ohio to the Dakotas, but also in
  the Pacific Northwest in general, though to a lesser degree.United States: The Upper
  SouthEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.By far the largest of the three original Anglo-American
  culture areas, the South is also the most idiosyncratic with respect to national
  norms—or slowest to accept them. The South was once so distinct from the non-South
  in almost every observable or quantifiable feature and so fiercely proud of its
  peculiarities that for some years the question of whether it could maintain political
  and social unity with the non-South was in serious doubt. These differences are
  still observable in almost every realm of human activity, including rural economy,
  dialect, diet, costume, folklore, politics, architecture, social customs, and recreation.
  Only during the 20th century can an argument be made that it has achieved a decisive
  convergence with the rest of the nation, at least in terms of economic behaviour
  and material culture.A persistent deviation from the national mainstream probably
  began in the first years of settlement. The first settlers of the South were almost
  purely British, not outwardly different from those who flocked to New England or
  the Midland, but almost certainly distinct in terms of motives and social values
  and more conservative in retaining the rurality and the family and social structure
  of premodern Europe. The vast importation of African slaves was also a major factor,
  as was a degree of contact with the Indians that was less pronounced farther north.
  In addition, the unusual pattern of economy (much different from that of northwestern
  Europe), settlement, and social organization, which were in part an adaptation to
  a starkly unfamiliar physical habitat, accentuated the South’s deviation from other
  culture areas.In both origin and spatial structure, the South has been characterized
  by diffuseness. In the search for a single cultural hearth, the most plausible choice
  is the Chesapeake Bay area and the northeastern corner of North Carolina, the earliest
  area of recognizably Southern character. Early components of Southern population
  and culture also arrived from other sources. A narrow coastal strip from North Carolina
  to the Georgia–Florida border and including the Sea Islands is decidedly Southern
  in character, yet it stands apart self-consciously from other parts of the South.
  Though colonized directly from Great Britain, it had also significant connections
  with the West Indies, in which relation the African cultural contribution was strongest
  and purest. Charleston and Savannah, which nurtured their own distinctive civilizations,
  dominated this subregion. Similarly, French Louisiana received elements of culture
  and population—to be stirred into the special Creole mixture—not only, putatively,
  from the Chesapeake Bay hearth area but also indirectly from France, French Nova
  Scotia, the French West Indies, and Africa. In south central Texas, the Germanic
  and Hispanic influx was so heavy that a special subregion can be designated.It would
  seem, then, that the Southern culture area may be an example of convergent, or parallel,
  evolution of a variety of elements arriving along several paths but subject to some
  single general process that could mold one larger regional consciousness and way
  of life.Because of its slowness in joining the national technological mainstream,
  the South can be subdivided into a much greater number of subregions than is possible
  for any of the other older traditional regions. Those described above are of lesser
  order than the two principal Souths, variously called Upper and Lower (or Deep)
  South, Upland and Lowland South, or Yeoman and Plantation South.The Upland South,
  which comprises the southern Appalachians, the upper Appalachian Piedmont, the Cumberland
  and other low interior plateaus, and the Ozarks and Ouachitas, was colonized culturally
  and demographically from the Chesapeake Bay hearth area and the Midland; it is most
  emphatically white Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) in character. The latter area,
  which contains a large black population, includes the greater part of the South
  Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains and the lower Appalachian Piedmont. Its early major
  influences came from the Chesapeake Bay area, with only minor elements from the
  coastal Carolina–Georgia belt, Louisiana, and elsewhere. The division between the
  two subregions remains distinct from Virginia to Texas, but each region can be further
  subdivided. Within the Upland South, the Ozark region might legitimately be detached
  from the Appalachian; and, within the latter, the proud and prosperous Kentucky
  Bluegrass, with its emphasis on tobacco and Thoroughbreds, certainly merits special
  recognition.Toward the margins of the South, the difficulties in delimiting subregions
  become greater. The outer limits themselves are a topic of special interest. There
  seems to be more than an accidental relation between these limits and various climatic
  factors. The fuzzy northern boundary, definitely not associated with the conventional
  Mason and Dixon Line or the Ohio River, seems most closely associated with length
  of frost-free season or with temperature during the winter. As the Southern cultural
  complex was carried to the West, it not only retained its strength but became more
  intense, in contrast to the influence of New England and the Midland. But the South
  finally fades away as one approaches the 100th meridian, with its critical decline
  in annual precipitation. The apparent correlation between the cultural South and
  a humid subtropical climatic regime is in many ways valid.The Texas subregion is
  so large, distinctive, vigorous, and self-assertive that it presents some vexing
  classificatory questions. Is Texas simply a subregion of the Greater South, or has
  it acquired so strong and divergent an identity that it can be regarded as a major
  region in its own right? It is likely that a major region has been born in a frontier
  zone in which several distinct cultural communities confront one another and in
  which the mixture has bred the vigorous, extroverted, aggressive Texas personality
  so widely celebrated in song and story. Similarly, peninsular Florida may be considered
  either within or juxtaposed to the South but not necessarily part of it. In the
  case of Florida, an almost empty territory began to receive significant settlement
  only after about 1890, and if, like Texas, most of it came from the older South,
  there were also vigorous infusions from elsewhere.United States: Middle Atlantic
  regionEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The significance of this region has not been
  less than that of New England or the South, but its characteristics are the least
  conspicuous to outsiders as well as to its own residents—reflecting, perhaps, its
  centrality in the course of U.S. development. The Midland (a term not to be confused
  with Midwest) comprises portions of Middle Atlantic and Upper Southern states: Pennsylvania,
  New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland. Serious European settlement of the Midland began
  a generation or more after that of the other major cultural centres and after several
  earlier, relatively ineffectual trials by the Dutch, Swedes, Finns, and British.
  But once begun late in the 17th century by William Penn and his associates, the
  colonization of the area was a success. Within southeastern Pennsylvania this culture
  area first assumed its distinctive character: a prosperous, sober, industrious agricultural
  society that quickly became a mixed economy as mercantile and later industrial functions
  came to the fore. By the mid-18th century much of the region had acquired a markedly
  urban character, resembling in many ways the more advanced portions of the North
  Sea countries. In this respect, at least, the Midland was well ahead of neighbouring
  areas to the north and south.It differed also in its polyglot ethnicity. From almost
  the beginning, the various ethnic and religious groups of the British Isles were
  joined by immigrants from the European mainland. This diversity has grown and is
  likely to continue. The mosaic of colonial ethnic groups has persisted in much of
  Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and Maryland, as has the remarkable variety
  of nationalities and churches in coalfields, company towns, cities, and many rural
  areas. Much of the same ethnic heterogeneity can be seen in New England, the Midwest,
  and a few other areas, but the Midland stands out as perhaps the most polyglot region
  of the nation. The Germanic element has always been notably strong, if irregularly
  distributed, in the Midland, accounting for more than 70 percent of the population
  of many towns. Had the Anglo-American culture not triumphed, the area might well
  have been designated Pennsylvania German.Physiography and migration carried the
  Midland culture area into the Maryland Piedmont. Although its width tapers quickly
  below the Potomac, it reaches into parts of Virginia and West Virginia, with traces
  legible far down the Appalachian zone and into the South.The northern half of the
  greater Midland region (the New York subregion, or New England Extended) cannot
  be assigned unequivocally to either New England or this Midland. Essentially it
  is a hybrid formed mainly from two regional strains of almost equal strength: New
  England and the post-1660 British element moving up the Hudson valley and beyond.
  There has also been a persistent, if slight, residue of early Dutch culture and
  some subtle filtering northward of Pennsylvanian influences. Apparently within the
  New York subregion occurred the first major fusion of American regional cultures,
  especially within the early 19th-century “Burned-Over District,” around the Finger
  Lakes and Genesee areas of central and western New York. This locality, the seedbed
  for a number of important social innovations, was a major staging area for westward
  migration and possibly a major source for the people and notions that were to build
  the Midwestern culture area.Toward the west the Midland retains its integrity for
  only a short distance—certainly no further than eastern Ohio—as it becomes submerged
  within the Midwest. Still, its significance in the genesis of the Midwest and the
  national culture should not be minimized. Its success in projecting its image upon
  so much of the country may have drawn attention away from the source area. As both
  name and location suggest, the Midland is intermediate in character in many respects,
  lying between New England and the South. Its residents are much less concerned with,
  or conscious of, a strong regional identity (excepting the Pennsylvania Dutch caricatures)
  than is true for the other regions, and, in addition, the Midland lacks their strong
  political and literary traditions, though it is unmistakable in its distinctive
  townscapes and farmsteads.United States: The MidwestEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.
  There is no such self-effacement in the Midwest, that large triangular region justly
  regarded as the most nearly representative of the national average. Everyone within
  or outside of the Midwest knows of its existence, but no one is certain where it
  begins or ends. The older apex of the eastward-pointing triangle appears to rest
  around Pittsburgh, while the two western corners melt away somewhere in the Great
  Plains, possibly in southern Manitoba in the north and southern Kansas in the south.
  The eastern terminus and the southern and western borders are broad, indistinct
  transitional zones.Serious study of the historical geography of the Midwest began
  only in the 20th century, but it seems likely that this culture region was the combination
  of all three colonial regions and that this combination first took place in the
  upper Ohio valley. The early routes of travel—the Ohio and its tributaries, the
  Great Lakes, and the low, level corridor along the Mohawk and the coastal plains
  of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie—converge upon Ohio. There, the people and cultural
  traits from New England, the Midland, and the South were first funneled together.
  There seems to have been a fanlike widening of the new hybrid area into the West
  as settlers worked their way frontierward.Two major subregions are readily discerned,
  the Upper and Lower Midwest. They are separated by a line, roughly approximating
  the 41st parallel, that persists as far west as Colorado in terms of speech patterns
  and indicates differences in regional provenance in ethnic and religious terms as
  well. Much of the Upper Midwest retains a faint New England character, although
  Midland influences are probably as important. A rich mixture of German, Scandinavian,
  Slavic, and other non-WASP elements has greatly diversified a stock in which the
  British element usually remains dominant and the range of church denominations is
  great. The Lower Midwest, except for the relative scarcity of blacks, tends to resemble
  the South in its predominantly Protestant and British makeup. There are some areas
  with sizable Roman Catholic and non-WASP populations, but on the whole the subregion
  tends to be more WASP in inclination than most other parts of the nation.Mountain
  Region: History and PeopleEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The foregoing culture areas
  account for roughly the eastern half of the coterminous United States. There is
  a dilemma in classifying the remaining half. The concept of the American West, strong
  in the popular imagination, is reinforced constantly by romanticized cinematic and
  television images of the cowboy. It is facile to accept the widespread Western livestock
  complex as epitomizing the full gamut of Western life, because although the cattle
  industry may have once accounted for more than one-half of the active Western domain
  as measured in acres, it employed only a relatively small fraction of the total
  population. As a single subculture, it cannot represent the total regional culture.It
  is not clear whether there is a genuine, single, grand Western culture region. Unlike
  the East, where virtually all the land is developed and culture areas and subregions
  abut and overlap in splendid confusion, the eight major and many lesser nodes of
  population in the western United States resemble oases, separated from one another
  by wide expanses of nearly unpopulated mountain or arid desert. The only obvious
  properties these isolated clusters have in common are, first, the intermixture of
  several strains of culture, primarily from the East but with additions from Europe,
  Mexico, and East Asia, and, second, except for one subregion, a general modernity,
  having been settled in a serious way no earlier than the 1840s. Some areas may be
  viewed as inchoate, or partially formed, cultural entities; the others have acquired
  definite personalities but are difficult to classify as first-order or lesser order
  culture areas.There are several major tracts in the western United States that reveal
  a genuine cultural identity: the Upper Rio Grande region, the Mormon region, southern
  California, and, by some accounts, northern California. To this group one might
  add the anomalous Texan and Oklahoman subregions, which have elements of both the
  West and the South.United States: The SouthwestEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The
  term Upper Rio Grande region was coined to denote the oldest and strongest of the
  three sectors of Hispanic-American activity in the Southwest, the others being southern
  California and portions of Texas. Although covering the valley of the upper Rio
  Grande, the region also embraces segments of Arizona and Colorado as well as other
  parts of New Mexico. European communities and culture have been present there, with
  only one interruption, since the late 16th century. The initial sources were Spain
  and Mexico, but after 1848 at least three distinct strains of Anglo-American culture
  were increasingly well represented—the Southern, Mormon, and a general undifferentiated
  Northeastern culture—plus a distinct Texan subcategory. For once this has occurred
  without obliterating the Indians, whose culture endures in various stages of dilution,
  from the strongly Americanized or Hispanicized to the almost undisturbed.The general
  mosaic is a fabric of Indian, Anglo, and Hispanic elements, and all three major
  groups, furthermore, are complex in character. The Indian component is made up of
  Navajo, Pueblo, and several smaller groups, each of which is quite distinct from
  the others. The Hispanic element is also diverse—modally Mexican mestizo, but ranging
  from pure Spanish to nearly pure pre-Spanish aboriginal.United States: The northern
  Mountain regionEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The Mormon region is expansive in the
  religious and demographic realms, though it has ceased to expand territorially as
  it did in the decades after the first settlement in the Salt Lake valley in 1847.
  Despite its Great Basin location and an exemplary adaptation to environmental constraints,
  this cultural complex appears somewhat non-Western in spirit: the Mormons may be
  in the West, but they are not entirely of it. Their historical derivation from the
  Midwest and from ultimate sources in New York and New England is still apparent,
  along with the generous admixture of European converts to their religion.As in New
  England, the power of the human will and an intensely cherished abstract design
  have triumphed over an unfriendly habitat. The Mormon way of life is expressed in
  the settlement landscape and economic activities within a region more homogeneous
  internally than any other U.S. culture area.CaliforniaEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.In
  contrast, northern California has yet to gain its own strong cultural coloration.
  From the beginning of the great 1849 gold rush the area drew a diverse population
  from Europe and Asia as well as the older portions of the United States. Whether
  the greater part of northern California has produced a culture amounting to more
  than the sum of the contributions brought by immigrants is questionable. San Francisco,
  the regional metropolis, may have crossed the qualitative threshold. An unusually
  cosmopolitan outlook that includes an awareness of the Orient stronger than that
  of any other U.S. city, a fierce self-esteem, and a unique townscape may be symptomatic
  of a genuinely new, emergent local culture.Southern California is the most spectacular
  of the Western regions, not only in terms of economic and population growth but
  also for the luxuriance, regional particularism, and general avant-garde character
  of its swiftly evolving cultural pattern. Until the coming of a direct transcontinental
  rail connection in 1885, the region was remote, rural, and largely inconsequential.
  Since then, the invasion by persons from virtually every corner of North America
  and by the world has been massive, but since the 1960s in-migration has slackened
  perceptibly, and many residents have begun to question the doctrine of unlimited
  growth. In any event, a loosely articulated series of urban and suburban developments
  continue to encroach upon what little is left of arable or habitable land in the
  Coast Ranges and valleys from Santa Barbara to the Mexican border.Although every
  major ethnic and racial group and every other U.S. culture area is amply represented
  in southern California, there is reason to suspect that a process of selection for
  certain types of people, attitudes, and personality traits may have been at work
  at both source and destination. The region is distinct from, or perhaps in the vanguard
  of, the remainder of the nation. One might view southern California as the super-American
  region or the outpost of a postindustrial future, but its cultural distinctiveness
  is very evident in landscape and social behaviour. Southern California in no way
  approaches being a “traditional region,” or even the smudged facsimile of such,
  but rather the largest, boldest experiment in creating a “voluntary region,” one
  built through the self-selection of immigrants and their subsequent interaction.United
  States: The northern Pacific CoastEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The remaining identifiable
  Western regions—the Willamette valley of Oregon, the Puget Sound region, the Inland
  Empire of eastern Washington and adjacent tracts of Idaho and Oregon, central Arizona,
  and the Colorado Piedmont—can be treated jointly as potential, or emergent, culture
  areas, still too close to the national mean to display any cultural distinctiveness.
  In all of these regions is evident the arrival of a cross section of the national
  population and the growth of regional life around one or more major metropolises.
  A New England element is noteworthy in the Willamette valley and Puget Sound regions,
  while a Hispanic-American component appears in the Colorado Piedmont and central
  Arizona. Only time and further study will reveal whether any of these regions, so
  distant from the historic sources of U.S. population and culture, have the capacity
  to become an independent cultural area.1Excludes 5 nonvoting delegates from the

  States of America, abbreviations U.S. or U.S.A., byname America, \n    country of
  North America, a federal republic of 50 states. Besides the 48 contiguous states
  that occupy the middle latitudes of the continent, the United States includes the
  state of Alaska, at the northwestern extreme of North America, and the island state
  of Hawaii, in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The coterminous states are bounded on the north
  by Canada, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the Gulf of Mexico
  and Mexico, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. The United States is the fourth
  largest country in the world in area (after Russia, Canada, and China). The national
  capital is Washington, which is coextensive with the District of Columbia, the federal
  capital region created in 1790.The major characteristic of the United States is
  probably its great variety. Its physical environment ranges from the Arctic to the
  subtropical, from the moist rain forest to the arid desert, from the rugged mountain
  peak to the flat prairie. Although the total population of the United States is
  large by world standards, its overall population density is relatively low; the
  country embraces some of the world’s largest urban concentrations as well as some
  of the most extensive areas that are almost devoid of habitation.The United States
  contains a highly diverse population. Unlike a country such as China that largely
  incorporated indigenous peoples, the United States has a diversity that to a great
  degree has come from an immense and sustained global immigration. Probably no other
  country has a wider range of racial, ethnic, and cultural types than does the United
  States. In addition to the presence of surviving Native Americans (including American
  Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos) and the descendants of Africans taken as slaves to
  the New World, the national character has been enriched, tested, and constantly
  redefined by the tens of millions of immigrants who by and large have come to America
  hoping for greater social, political, and economic opportunities than they had in
  the places they left. (It should be noted that although the terms “America” and
  “Americans” are often used as synonyms for the United States and its citizens, respectively,
  they are also used in a broader sense for North, South, and Central America collectively
  and their citizens.)The United States is the world’s greatest economic power, measured
  in terms of gross national product (GNP). The nation’s wealth is partly a reflection
  of its rich natural resources and its enormous agricultural output, but it owes
  more to the country’s highly developed industry. Despite its relative economic self-sufficiency
  in many areas, the United States is the most important single factor in world trade
  by virtue of the sheer size of its economy. Its exports and imports represent major
  proportions of the world total. The United States also impinges on the global economy
  as a source of and as a destination for investment capital. The country continues
  to sustain an economic life that is more diversified than any other on Earth, providing
  the majority of its people with one of the world’s highest standards of living.The
  United States is relatively young by world standards, being barely more than 200
  years old; it achieved its current size only in the mid-20th century. America was
  the first of the European colonies to separate successfully from its motherland,
  and it was the first nation to be established on the premise that sovereignty rests
  with its citizens and not with the government. In its first century and a half,
  the country was mainly preoccupied with its own territorial expansion and economic
  growth and with social debates that ultimately led to civil war and a healing period
  that is still not complete. In the 20th century the United States emerged as a world
  power, and since World War II it has been one of the preeminent powers. It has not
  accepted this mantle easily nor always carried it willingly; the principles and
  ideals of its founders have been tested by the pressures and exigencies of its dominant
  status. Although the United States still offers its residents opportunities for
  unparalleled personal advancement and wealth, the depletion of its resources, contamination
  of its environment, and continuing social and economic inequality that perpetuates
  areas of poverty and blight all threaten the fabric of the country.Ed.The District
  of Columbia is discussed in the article Washington. For discussion of other major
  U.S. cities, see the articles Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York
  City, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. Political units in association with the United
  States include Puerto Rico, discussed in the article Puerto Rico, and several Pacific
  islands, discussed in Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa.The landThe
  two great sets of elements that mold the physical environment of the United States
  are, first, the geologic, which determines the main patterns of landforms, drainage,
  and mineral resources and influences soils to a lesser degree, and, second, the
  atmospheric, which dictates not only climate and weather but also in large part
  the distribution of soils, plants, and animals. Although these elements are not
  entirely independent of one another, each produces on a map patterns that are so
  profoundly different that essentially they remain two separate geographies. (Since
  this article covers only the coterminous United States, see also the articles Alaska
  and Hawaii.)ReliefThe centre of the coterminous United States is a great sprawling
  interior lowland, reaching from the ancient shield of central Canada on the north
  to the Gulf of Mexico on the south. To east and west this lowland rises, first gradually
  and then abruptly, to mountain ranges that divide it from the sea on both sides.
  The two mountain systems differ drastically. The Appalachian Mountains on the east
  are low, almost unbroken, and in the main set well back from the Atlantic. From
  New York to the Mexican border stretches the low Coastal Plain, which faces the
  ocean along a swampy, convoluted coast. The gently sloping surface of the plain
  extends out beneath the sea, where it forms the continental shelf, which, although
  submerged beneath shallow ocean water, is geologically identical to the Coastal
  Plain. Southward the plain grows wider, swinging westward in Georgia and Alabama
  to truncate the Appalachians along their southern extremity and separate the interior
  lowland from the Gulf.West of the Central Lowland is the mighty Cordillera, part
  of a global mountain system that rings the Pacific Basin. The Cordillera encompasses
  fully one-third of the United States, with an internal variety commensurate with
  its size. At its eastern margin lie the Rocky Mountains, a high, diverse, and discontinuous
  chain that stretches all the way from New Mexico to the Canadian border. The Cordillera’s
  western edge is a Pacific coastal chain of rugged mountains and inland valleys,
  the whole rising spectacularly from the sea without benefit of a coastal plain.
  Pent between the Rockies and the Pacific chain is a vast intermontane complex of
  basins, plateaus, and isolated ranges so large and remarkable that they merit recognition
  as a region separate from the Cordillera itself.These regions—the Interior Lowlands
  and their upland fringes, the Appalachian Mountain system, the Atlantic Plain, the
  Western Cordillera, and the Western Intermontane Region—are so various that they
  require further division into 24 major subregions, or provinces (see map).The Interior
  Lowlands and their upland fringesMidwest States: GeographyEncyclopædia Britannica,
  Inc.Andrew Jackson is supposed to have remarked that the United States begins at
  the Alleghenies, implying that only west of the mountains, in the isolation and
  freedom of the great Interior Lowlands, could people finally escape Old World influences.
  Whether or not the lowlands constitute the country’s cultural core is debatable,
  but there can be no doubt that they comprise its geologic core and in many ways
  its geographic core as well.This enormous region rests upon an ancient, much-eroded
  platform of complex crystalline rocks that have for the most part lain undisturbed
  by major orogenic (mountain-building) activity for more than 600,000,000 years.
  Over much of central Canada, these Precambrian rocks are exposed at the surface
  and form the continent’s single largest topographical region, the formidable and
  ice-scoured Canadian Shield.In the United States most of the crystalline platform
  is concealed under a deep blanket of sedimentary rocks. In the far north, however,
  the naked Canadian Shield extends into the United States far enough to form two
  small but distinctive landform regions: the rugged and occasionally spectacular
  Adirondack Mountains of northern New York; and the more subdued but austere Superior
  Uplands of northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. As in the rest of the shield,
  glaciers have stripped soils away, strewn the surface with boulders and other debris,
  and obliterated preglacial drainage systems. Most attempts at farming in these areas
  have been abandoned, but the combination of a comparative wilderness in a northern
  climate, clear lakes, and white-water streams has fostered the development of both
  regions as year-round outdoor recreation areas.Mineral wealth in the Superior Uplands
  is legendary. Iron lies near the surface and close to the deepwater ports of the
  upper Great Lakes. Iron is mined both north and south of Lake Superior, but best
  known are the colossal deposits of Minnesota’s Mesabi Range, for more than a century
  one of the world’s richest and a vital element in America’s rise to industrial power.
  In spite of depletion, the Minnesota and Michigan mines still yield a major proportion
  of the country’s iron and a significant percentage of the world’s supply.South of
  the Adirondack Mountains and Superior Uplands lies the boundary between crystalline
  and sedimentary rocks; abruptly, everything is different. The core of this sedimentary
  region—the heartland of the United States—is the great Central Lowland, which stretches
  for 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometres) from New York to central Texas and north another
  1,000 miles to the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. To some, the landscape may
  seem dull, for heights of more than 2,000 feet (600 metres) are unusual, and truly
  rough terrain is almost lacking. Landscapes are varied, however, largely as the
  result of glaciation that directly or indirectly affected most of the subregion.
  North of the Missouri–Ohio river line, the advance and readvance of continental
  ice left an intricate mosaic of boulders, sand, gravel, silt, and clay and a complex
  pattern of lakes and drainage channels, some abandoned, some still in use. The southern
  part of the Central Lowland is quite different, covered mostly with loess (wind-deposited
  silt) that further subdued the already low relief surface. Elsewhere, especially
  near major rivers, postglacial streams carved the loess into rounded hills, and
  visitors have aptly compared their billowing shapes to the waves of the sea. Above
  all, the loess produces soil of extraordinary fertility. As the Mesabi iron was
  a major source of America’s industrial wealth, its agricultural prosperity has been
  rooted in Midwestern loess.The Central Lowland resembles a vast saucer, rising gradually
  to higher lands on all sides. Southward and eastward, the land rises gradually to
  three major plateaus. Beyond the reach of glaciation to the south, the sedimentary
  rocks have been raised into two broad upwarps, separated from one another by the
  great valley of the Mississippi River. The Ozark Plateau lies west of the river
  and occupies most of southern Missouri and northern Arkansas; on the east the Interior
  Low Plateaus dominate central Kentucky and Tennessee. Except for two nearly circular
  patches of rich limestone country—the Nashville Basin of Tennessee and the Kentucky
  Bluegrass region—most of both plateau regions consists of sandstone uplands, intricately
  dissected by streams. Local relief runs to several hundreds of feet in most places,
  and visitors to the region must travel winding roads along narrow stream valleys.
  The soils there are poor, and mineral resources are scanty.Eastward from the Central
  Lowland the Appalachian Plateau—a narrow band of dissected uplands that strongly
  resembles the Ozark Plateau and Interior Low Plateaus in steep slopes, wretched
  soils, and endemic poverty—forms a transition between the interior plains and the
  Appalachian Mountains. Usually, however, the Appalachian Plateau is considered a
  subregion of the Appalachian Mountains, partly on grounds of location, partly because
  of geologic structure. Unlike the other plateaus, where rocks are warped upward,
  the rocks there form an elongated basin, wherein bituminous coal has been preserved
  from erosion. This Appalachian coal, like the Mesabi iron that it complements in
  U.S. industry, is extraordinary. Extensive, thick, and close to the surface, it
  has stoked the furnaces of northeastern steel mills for decades and helps explain
  the huge concentration of heavy industry along the lower Great Lakes.The western
  flanks of the Interior Lowlands are the Great Plains, a territory of awesome bulk
  that spans the full distance between Canada and Mexico in a swath nearly 500 miles
  wide. The Great Plains were built by successive layers of poorly cemented sand,
  silt, and gravel—debris laid down by parallel east-flowing streams from the Rocky
  Mountains. Seen from the east, the surface of the Great Plains rises inexorably
  from about 2,000 feet near Omaha, Neb., to more than 6,000 feet at Cheyenne, Wyo.,
  but the climb is so gradual that popular legend holds the Great Plains to be flat.
  True flatness is rare, although the High Plains of western Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas,
  and eastern Colorado come close. More commonly, the land is broadly rolling, and
  parts of the northern plains are sharply dissected into badlands.The main mineral
  wealth of the Interior Lowlands derives from fossil fuels. Coal occurs in structural
  basins protected from erosion—high-quality bituminous in the Appalachian, Illinois,
  and western Kentucky basins; and subbituminous and lignite in the eastern and northwestern
  Great Plains. Petroleum and natural gas have been found in nearly every state between
  the Appalachians and the Rockies, but the Midcontinent Fields of western Texas and
  the Texas Panhandle, Oklahoma, and Kansas surpass all others. Aside from small deposits
  of lead and zinc, metallic minerals are of little importance.The Appalachian Mountain
  systemScrew Auger Falls© George WuerthnerThe Appalachians dominate the eastern United
  States and separate the Eastern Seaboard from the interior with a belt of subdued
  uplands that extends nearly 1,500 miles from northeastern Alabama to the Canadian
  border. They are old, complex mountains, the eroded stumps of much greater ranges.
  Present topography results from erosion that has carved weak rocks away, leaving
  a skeleton of resistant rocks behind as highlands. Geologic differences are thus
  faithfully reflected in topography. In the Appalachians these differences are sharply
  demarcated and neatly arranged, so that all the major subdivisions except New England
  lie in strips parallel to the Atlantic and to one another.The core of the Appalachians
  is a belt of complex metamorphic and igneous rocks that stretches all the way from
  Alabama to New Hampshire. The western side of this belt forms the long slender rampart
  of the Blue Ridge Mountains, containing the highest elevations in the Appalachians
  (Mount Mitchell, N.C., 6,684 feet [2,037 metres]) and some of its most handsome
  mountain scenery. On its eastern, or seaward, side the Blue Ridge descends in an
  abrupt and sometimes spectacular escarpment to the Piedmont, a well-drained, rolling
  land—never quite hills, but never quite a plain. Before the settlement of the Midwest
  the Piedmont was the most productive agricultural region in the United States, and
  several Pennsylvania counties still consistently report some of the highest farm
  yields per acre in the entire country.West of the crystalline zone, away from the
  axis of primary geologic deformation, sedimentary rocks have escaped metamorphism
  but are compressed into tight folds. Erosion has carved the upturned edges of these
  folded rocks into the remarkable Ridge and Valley country of the western Appalachians.
  Long linear ridges characteristically stand about 1,000 feet from base to crest
  and run for tens of miles, paralleled by broad open valleys of comparable length.
  In Pennsylvania, ridges run unbroken for great distances, occasionally turning abruptly
  in a zigzag pattern; by contrast, the southern ridges are broken by faults and form
  short, parallel segments that are lined up like magnetized iron filings. By far
  the largest valley—and one of the most important routes in North America—is the
  Great Valley, an extraordinary trench of shale and limestone that runs nearly the
  entire length of the Appalachians. It provides a lowland passage from the middle
  Hudson valley to Harrisburg, Pa., and on southward, where it forms the Shenandoah
  and Cumberland valleys, and has been one of the main paths through the Appalachians
  since pioneer times. In New England it is floored with slates and marbles and forms
  the Valley of Vermont, one of the few fertile areas in an otherwise mountainous
  region.Topography much like that of the Ridge and Valley is found in the Ouachita
  Mountains of western Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma, an area generally thought to
  be a detached continuation of Appalachian geologic structure, the intervening section
  buried beneath the sediments of the lower Mississippi valley.The once-glaciated
  New England section of the Appalachians is divided from the rest of the chain by
  an indentation of the Atlantic. Although almost completely underlain by crystalline
  rocks, New England is laid out in north–south bands, reminiscent of the southern
  Appalachians. The rolling, rocky hills of southeastern New England are not dissimilar
  to the Piedmont, while, farther northwest, the rugged and lofty White Mountains
  are a New England analogue to the Blue Ridge. (Mount Washington, N.H., at 6,288
  feet [1917 metres], is the highest peak in the northeastern United States.) The
  westernmost ranges—the Taconics, Berkshires, and Green Mountains—show a strong north–south
  lineation like the Ridge and Valley. Unlike the rest of the Appalachians, however,
  glaciation has scoured the crystalline rocks much like those of the Canadian Shield,
  so that New England is best known for its picturesque landscape, not for its fertile
  soil.Typical of diverse geologic regions, the Appalachians contain a great variety
  of minerals. Only a few occur in quantities large enough for sustained exploitation,
  notably iron in Pennsylvania’s Blue Ridge and Piedmont and the famous granites,
  marbles, and slates of northern New England. In Pennsylvania the Ridge and Valley
  region contains one of the world’s largest deposits of anthracite coal, once the
  basis of a thriving mining economy; many of the mines are now shut, oil and gas
  having replaced coal as the major fuel used to heat homes.The Atlantic PlainNortheast
  USA: Physical LandscapeEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The eastern and southeastern
  fringes of the United States are part of the outermost margins of the continental
  platform, repeatedly invaded by the sea and veneered with layer after layer of young,
  poorly consolidated sediments. Part of this platform now lies slightly above sea
  level and forms a nearly flat and often swampy coastal plain, which stretches from
  Cape Cod, Mass., to beyond the Mexican border. Most of the platform, however, is
  still submerged, so that a band of shallow water, the continental shelf, parallels
  the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, in some places reaching 250 miles out to sea.The Atlantic
  Plain slopes so gently that even slight crustal upwarping can shift the coastline
  far out to sea at the expense of the continental shelf. The peninsula of Florida
  is just such an upwarp; nowhere in its 400-mile length does the land rise more than
  350 feet above sea level; much of the southern and coastal areas rise less than
  10 feet and are poorly drained and dangerously exposed to Atlantic storms. Downwarps
  can result in extensive flooding. North of New York City, for example, the weight
  of glacial ice depressed most of the Coastal Plain beneath the sea, and the Atlantic
  now beats directly against New England’s rock-ribbed coasts. Cape Cod, Long Island
  (N.Y.), and a few offshore islands are all that remain of New England’s drowned
  Coastal Plain. Another downwarp lies perpendicular to the Gulf coast and guides
  the course of the lower Mississippi. The river, however, has filled with alluvium
  what otherwise would be an arm of the Gulf, forming a great inland salient of the
  Coastal Plain called the Mississippi Embayment.The Southeast: GeographyEncyclopædia
  Britannica, Inc.South of New York the Coastal Plain gradually widens, but ocean
  water has invaded the lower valleys of most of the coastal rivers and has turned
  them into estuaries. The greatest of these is Chesapeake Bay, merely the flooded
  lower valley of the Susquehanna River and its tributaries, but there are hundreds
  of others. Offshore a line of sandbars and barrier beaches stretches intermittently
  the length of the Coastal Plain, hampering entry of shipping into the estuaries
  but providing the eastern United States with a playground that is more than 1,000
  miles long.Poor soils are the rule on the Coastal Plain, though rare exceptions
  have formed some of America’s most famous agricultural regions—for example, the
  citrus country of central Florida’s limestone uplands and the Cotton Belt of the
  Old South, once centred on the alluvial plain of the Mississippi and belts of chalky
  black soils of eastern Texas, Alabama, and Mississippi. The Atlantic Plain’s greatest
  natural wealth derives from petroleum and natural gas trapped in domal structures
  that dot the Gulf Coast of eastern Texas and Louisiana. Onshore and offshore drilling
  have revealed colossal reserves of oil and natural gas.The Western CordilleraMountain
  Region: GeographyEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.West of the Great Plains the United
  States seems to become a craggy land whose skyline is rarely without mountains—totally
  different from the open plains and rounded hills of the East. On a map the alignment
  of the two main chains—the Rocky Mountains on the east, the Pacific ranges on the
  west—tempts one to assume a geologic and hence topographic homogeneity. Nothing
  could be farther from the truth, for each chain is divided into widely disparate
  sections.The Rockies are typically diverse. The Southern Rockies are composed of
  a disconnected series of lofty elongated upwarps, their cores made of granitic basement
  rocks, stripped of sediments, and heavily glaciated at high elevations. In New Mexico
  and along the western flanks of the Colorado ranges, widespread volcanism and deformation
  of colourful sedimentary rocks have produced rugged and picturesque country, but
  the characteristic central Colorado or southern Wyoming range is impressively austere
  rather than spectacular. The Front Range west of Denver is prototypical, rising
  abruptly from its base at about 6,000 feet to rolling alpine meadows between 11,000
  and 12,000 feet. Peaks appear as low hills perched on this high-level surface, so
  that Colorado, for example, boasts 53 mountains over 14,000 feet but not one over
  14,500 feet.The Middle Rockies cover most of west central Wyoming. Most of the ranges
  resemble the granitic upwarps of Colorado, but thrust faulting and volcanism have
  produced varied and spectacular country to the west, some of which is included in
  Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks. Much of the subregion, however, is not
  mountainous at all but consists of extensive intermontane basins and plains—largely
  floored with enormous volumes of sedimentary waste eroded from the mountains themselves.
  Whole ranges have been buried, producing the greatest gap in the Cordilleran system,
  the Wyoming Basin—resembling in geologic structure and topography an intermontane
  peninsula of the Great Plains. As a result, the Rockies have never posed an important
  barrier to east–west transportation in the United States; all major routes, from
  the Oregon Trail to interstate highways, funnel through the basin, essentially circumventing
  the main ranges of the Rockies.The Northern Rockies contain the most varied mountain
  landscapes of the Cordillera, reflecting a corresponding geologic complexity. The
  region’s backbone is a mighty series of batholiths—huge masses of molten rock that
  slowly cooled below the surface and were later uplifted. The batholiths are eroded
  into rugged granitic ranges, which, in central Idaho, compose the most extensive
  wilderness country in the coterminous United States. East of the batholiths and
  opposite the Great Plains, sediments have been folded and thrust-faulted into a
  series of linear north–south ranges, a southern extension of the spectacular Canadian
  Rockies. Although elevations run 2,000 to 3,000 feet lower than the Colorado Rockies
  (most of the Idaho Rockies lie well below 10,000 feet), increased rainfall and northern
  latitude have encouraged glaciation—there as elsewhere a sculptor of handsome alpine
  landscape.The Pacific Region: OverviewEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The western branch
  of the Cordillera directly abuts the Pacific Ocean. This coastal chain, like its
  Rocky Mountain cousins on the eastern flank of the Cordillera, conceals bewildering
  complexity behind a facade of apparent simplicity. At first glance the chain consists
  merely of two lines of mountains with a discontinuous trough between them. Immediately
  behind the coast is a line of hills and low mountains—the Pacific Coast Ranges.
  Farther inland, averaging 150 miles from the coast, the line of the Sierra Nevada
  and the Cascade Range includes the highest elevations in the coterminous United
  States. Between these two unequal mountain lines is a discontinuous trench, the
  Troughs of the Coastal Margin.Kings Canyon National ParkJosef MuenchThe apparent
  simplicity disappears under the most cursory examination. The Pacific Coast Ranges
  actually contain five distinct sections, each of different geologic origin and each
  with its own distinctive topography. The Transverse Ranges of southern California
  are a crowded assemblage of islandlike faulted ranges, with peak elevations of more
  than 10,000 feet but sufficiently separated by plains and low passes so that travel
  through them is easy. From Point Conception to the Oregon border, however, the main
  California Coast Ranges are entirely different, resembling the Appalachian Ridge
  and Valley region, with low linear ranges that result from erosion of faulted and
  folded rocks. Major faults run parallel to the low ridges, and the greatest—the
  notorious San Andreas Fault—was responsible for the earthquake that all but destroyed
  San Francisco in 1906. Along the California–Oregon border, everything changes again.
  In this region, the wildly rugged Klamath Mountains represent a western salient
  of interior structure reminiscent of the Idaho Rockies and the northern Sierra Nevada.
  In western Oregon and southwestern Washington the Coast Ranges are also different—a
  gentle, hilly land carved by streams from a broad arch of marine deposits interbedded
  with tabular lavas. In the northernmost part of the Coast Ranges and the remote
  northwest, a domal upwarp has produced the Olympic Mountains; its serrated peaks
  tower nearly 8,000 feet above Puget Sound and the Pacific, and the heavy precipitation
  on its upper slopes supports the largest active glaciers in the United States outside
  of Alaska.East of these Pacific Coast Ranges the Troughs of the Coastal Margin contain
  the only extensive lowland plains of the Pacific margin—California’s Central Valley,
  Oregon’s Willamette River valley, and the half-drowned basin of Puget Sound in Washington.
  Parts of an inland trench that extends for great distances along the east coast
  of the Pacific, similar valleys occur in such diverse areas as Chile and the Alaska
  panhandle. These valleys are blessed with superior soils, easily irrigated, and
  very accessible from the Pacific. They have enticed settlers for more than a century
  and have become the main centres of population and economic activity for much of
  the U.S. West Coast.Still farther east rise the two highest mountain chains in the
  coterminous United States—the Cascades and the Sierra Nevada. Aside from elevation,
  geographic continuity, and spectacular scenery, however, the two ranges differ in
  almost every important respect. Except for its northern section, where sedimentary
  and metamorphic rocks occur, the Sierra Nevada is largely made of granite, part
  of the same batholithic chain that creates the Idaho Rockies. The range is grossly
  asymmetrical, the result of massive faulting that has gently tilted the western
  slopes toward the Central Valley but has uplifted the eastern side to confront the
  interior with an escarpment nearly two miles high. At high elevation glaciers have
  scoured the granites to a gleaming white, while on the west the ice has carved spectacular
  valleys such as the Yosemite. The loftiest peak in the Sierras is Mount Whitney,
  which at 14,494 feet (4,418 metres) is the highest mountain in the coterminous states.
  The upfaulting that produced Mount Whitney is accompanied by downfaulting that formed
  nearby Death Valley, at 282 feet (86 metres) below sea level the lowest point in
  North America.The Cascades are made largely of volcanic rock; those in northern
  Washington contain granite like the Sierras, but the rest are formed from relatively
  recent lava outpourings of dun-coloured basalt and andesite. The Cascades are in
  effect two ranges. The lower, older range is a long belt of upwarped lava, rising
  unspectacularly to elevations between 6,000 and 8,000 feet. Perched above the “low
  Cascades” is a chain of lofty volcanoes that punctuate the horizon with magnificent
  glacier-clad peaks. The highest is Mount Rainier, which at 14,410 feet (4,392 metres)
  is all the more dramatic for rising from near sea level. Most of these volcanoes
  are quiescent, but they are far from extinct. Mount Lassen in northern California
  erupted violently in 1914, as did Mount St. Helens in the state of Washington in
  1980. Most of the other high Cascade volcanoes exhibit some sign of seismic activity.The
  Western Intermontane RegionBeartooth Range© John ElkThe Cordillera’s two main chains
  enclose a vast intermontane region of arid basins, plateaus, and isolated mountain
  ranges that stretches from the Mexican border nearly to Canada and extends 600 miles
  from east to west. This enormous territory contains three huge subregions, each
  with a distinctive geologic history and its own striking topography.The Colorado
  Plateau, nestled against the western flanks of the Southern Rockies, is an extraordinary
  island of geologic stability set in the turbulent sea of Cordilleran tectonic activity.
  Stability was not absolute, of course, so that parts of the plateau are warped and
  injected with volcanics, but in general the landscape results from the erosion by
  streams of nearly flat-lying sedimentary rocks. The result is a mosaic of angular
  mesas, buttes, and steplike canyons intricately cut from rocks that often are vividly
  coloured. Large areas of the plateau are so improbably picturesque that they have
  been set aside as national preserves. The Grand Canyon of the Colorado River is
  the most famous of several dozen such areas.West of the plateau and abutting the
  Sierra Nevada’s eastern escarpment lies the arid Basin and Range subregion, among
  the most remarkable topographic provinces of the United States. The Basin and Range
  extends from southern Oregon and Idaho into northern Mexico. Rocks of great complexity
  have been broken by faulting, and the resulting blocks have tumbled, eroded, and
  been partly buried by lava and alluvial debris accumulating in the desert basins.
  The eroded blocks form mountain ranges that are characteristically dozens of miles
  long, several thousand feet from base to crest, with peak elevations that rarely
  rise to more than 10,000 feet, and almost always aligned roughly north–south. The
  basin floors are typically alluvium and sometimes salt marshes or alkali flats.The
  third intermontane region, the Columbia Basin, is literally the last, for in some
  parts its rocks are still being formed. Its entire area is underlain by innumerable
  tabular lava flows that have flooded the basin between the Cascades and Northern
  Rockies to undetermined depths. The volume of lava must be measured in thousands
  of cubic miles, for the flows blanket large parts of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho
  and in southern Idaho have drowned the flanks of the Northern Rocky Mountains in
  a basaltic sea. Where the lavas are fresh, as in southern Idaho, the surface is
  often nearly flat, but more often the floors have been trenched by rivers—conspicuously
  the Columbia and the Snake—or by glacial floodwaters that have carved an intricate
  system of braided canyons in the remarkable Channeled Scablands of eastern Washington.
  In surface form the eroded lava often resembles the topography of the Colorado Plateau,
  but the gaudy colours of the Colorado are replaced here by the sombre black and
  rusty brown of weathered basalt.Most large mountain systems are sources of varied
  mineral wealth, and the American Cordillera is no exception. Metallic minerals have
  been taken from most crystalline regions and have furnished the United States with
  both romance and wealth—the Sierra Nevada gold that provoked the 1849 gold rush,
  the fabulous silver lodes of western Nevada’s Basin and Range, and gold strikes
  all along the Rocky Mountain chain. Industrial metals, however, are now far more
  important; copper and lead are among the base metals, and the more exotic molybdenum,
  vanadium, and cadmium are mainly useful in alloys.In the Cordillera, as elsewhere,
  the greatest wealth stems from fuels. Most major basins contain oil and natural
  gas, conspicuously the Wyoming Basin, the Central Valley of California, and the
  Los Angeles Basin. The Colorado Plateau, however, has yielded some of the most interesting
  discoveries—considerable deposits of uranium and colossal occurrences of oil shale.
  Oil from the shale, however, probably cannot be economically removed without widespread
  strip-mining and correspondingly large-scale damage to the environment. Wide exploitation
  of low-sulfur bituminous coal has been initiated in the Four Corners area of the
  Colorado Plateau, and open-pit mining has already devastated parts of this once-pristine
  country as completely as it has West Virginia.DrainageAs befits a nation of continental
  proportions, the United States has an extraordinary network of rivers and lakes,
  including some of the largest and most useful in the world. In the humid East they
  provide an enormous mileage of cheap inland transportation; westward, most rivers
  and streams are unnavigable but are heavily used for irrigation and power generation.
  Both East and West, however, traditionally have used lakes and streams as public
  sewers, and despite efforts to clean them up, most large waterways are laden with
  vast, poisonous volumes of industrial, agricultural, and human wastes.The Eastern
  systemsChief among U.S. rivers is the Mississippi, which, with its great tributaries,
  the Ohio and the Missouri, drains most of the midcontinent. The Mississippi is navigable
  to Minneapolis nearly 1,200 miles by air from the Gulf of Mexico; and along with
  the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence system it forms the world’s greatest network of inland
  waterways. The Mississippi’s eastern branches, chiefly the Ohio and the Tennessee,
  are also navigable for great distances. From the west, however, many of its numerous
  Great Plains tributaries are too seasonal and choked with sandbars to be used for
  shipping. The Missouri, for example, though longer than the Mississippi itself,
  was essentially without navigation until the mid-20th century, when a combination
  of dams, locks, and dredging opened the river to barge traffic.The Great Lakes–St.
  Lawrence system, the other half of the midcontinental inland waterway, is connected
  to the Mississippi–Ohio via Chicago by canals and the Illinois River. The five Great
  Lakes (four of which are shared with Canada) constitute by far the largest freshwater
  lake group in the world and carry a larger tonnage of shipping than any other. The
  three main barriers to navigation—the St. Marys Rapids, at Sault Sainte Marie; Niagara
  Falls; and the rapids of the St. Lawrence—are all bypassed by locks, whose 27-foot
  draft lets ocean vessels penetrate 1,300 miles into the continent, as far as Duluth,
  Minnesota, and Chicago.The third group of Eastern rivers drains the coastal strip
  along the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Except for the Rio Grande, which
  rises west of the Rockies and flows about 1,900 circuitous miles to the Gulf, few
  of these coastal rivers measure more than 300 miles, and most flow in an almost
  straight line to the sea. Except in glaciated New England and in arid southwestern
  Texas, most of the larger coastal streams are navigable for some distance.The Pacific
  systemsWest of the Rockies, nearly all of the rivers are strongly influenced by
  aridity. In the deserts and steppes of the intermontane basins, most of the scanty
  runoff disappears into interior basins, only one of which, the Great Salt Lake,
  holds any substantial volume of water. Aside from a few minor coastal streams, only
  three large river systems manage to reach the sea—the Columbia, the Colorado, and
  the San Joaquin–Sacramento system of California’s Central Valley. All three of these
  river systems are exotic: that is, they flow for considerable distances across dry
  lands from which they receive little water. Both the Columbia and the Colorado have
  carved awesome gorges, the former through the sombre lavas of the Cascades and the
  Columbia Basin, the latter through the brilliantly coloured rocks of the Colorado
  Plateau. These gorges lend themselves to easy damming, and the once-wild Columbia
  has been turned into a stairway of placid lakes whose waters irrigate the arid plateaus
  of eastern Washington and power one of the world’s largest hydroelectric networks.
  The Colorado is less extensively developed, and proposals for new dam construction
  have met fierce opposition from those who want to preserve the spectacular natural
  beauty of the river’s canyon lands.ClimateClimate affects human habitats both directly
  and indirectly through its influence on vegetation, soils, and wildlife. In the
  United States, however, the natural environment has been altered drastically by
  nearly four centuries of European settlement, as well as thousands of years of Indian
  occupancy.Wherever land is abandoned, however, “wild” conditions return rapidly,
  achieving over the long run a dynamic equilibrium among soils, vegetation, and the
  inexorable strictures of climate. Thus, though Americans have created an artificial
  environment of continental proportions, the United States still can be divided into
  a mosaic of bioclimatic regions, each of them distinguished by peculiar climatic
  conditions and each with a potential vegetation and soil that eventually would return
  in the absence of humans. The main exception to this generalization applies to fauna,
  so drastically altered that it is almost impossible to know what sort of animal
  geography would redevelop in the areas of the United States if humans were removed
  from the scene.Climatic controlsThe pattern of U.S. climates is largely set by the
  location of the coterminous United States almost entirely in the middle latitudes,
  by its position with respect to the continental landmass and its fringing oceans,
  and by the nation’s gross pattern of mountains and lowlands. Each of these geographic
  controls operates to determine the character of air masses and their changing behaviour
  from season to season.The coterminous United States lies entirely between the tropic
  of Cancer and 50° N latitude, a position that confines Arctic climates to the high
  mountaintops and genuine tropics to a small part of southern Florida. By no means,
  however, is the climate literally temperate, for the middle latitudes are notorious
  for extreme variations of temperature and precipitation.The great size of the North
  American landmass tends to reinforce these extremes. Since land heats and cools
  more rapidly than bodies of water, places distant from an ocean tend to have continental
  climates; that is, they alternate between extremes of hot summers and cold winters,
  in contrast to the marine climates, which are more equable. Most U.S. climates are
  markedly continental, the more so because the Cordillera effectively confines the
  moderating Pacific influence to a narrow strip along the West Coast. Extremes of
  continentality occur near the centre of the country, and in North Dakota temperatures
  have ranged between a summer high record of 121 °F (49 °C) and a winter low of −60
  °F (−51 °C). Moreover, the general eastward drift of air over the United States
  carries continental temperatures all the way to the Atlantic coast. Bismarck, N.D.,
  for example, has a great annual temperature range. Boston, on the Atlantic but largely
  exempt from its influence, has a lesser but still-continental range, while San Francisco,
  which is under strong Pacific influence, has only a small summer–winter differential.In
  addition to confining Pacific temperatures to the coastal margin, the Pacific Coast
  Ranges are high enough to make a local rain shadow in their lee, although the main
  barrier is the great rampart formed by the Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges. Rainy
  on their western slopes and barren on the east, this mountain crest forms one of
  the sharpest climatic divides in the United States.The rain shadow continues east
  to the Rockies, leaving the entire Intermontane Region either arid or semiarid,
  except where isolated ranges manage to capture leftover moisture at high altitudes.
  East of the Rockies the westerly drift brings mainly dry air, and as a result, the
  Great Plains are semiarid. Still farther east, humidity increases owing to the frequent
  incursion from the south of warm, moist, and unstable air from the Gulf of Mexico,
  which produces more precipitation in the United States than the Pacific and Atlantic
  oceans combined.Although the landforms of the Interior Lowlands have been termed
  dull, there is nothing dull about their weather conditions. Air from the Gulf of
  Mexico can flow northward across the Great Plains, uninterrupted by topographical
  barriers, but continental Canadian air flows south by the same route, and, since
  these two air masses differ in every important respect, the collisions often produce
  disturbances of monumental violence. Plainsmen and Midwesterners are accustomed
  to sudden displays of furious weather—tornadoes, blizzards, hailstorms, precipitous
  drops and rises in temperature, and a host of other spectacular meteorological displays,
  sometimes dangerous but seldom boring.The change of seasonsMost of the United States
  is marked by sharp differences between winter and summer. In winter, when temperature
  contrasts between land and water are greatest, huge masses of frigid, dry Canadian
  air periodically spread far south over the midcontinent, bringing cold, sparkling
  weather to the interior and generating great cyclonic storms where their leading
  edges confront the shrunken mass of warm Gulf air to the south. Although such cyclonic
  activity occurs throughout the year, it is most frequent and intense during the
  winter, parading eastward out of the Great Plains to bring the Eastern states practically
  all their winter precipitation. Winter temperatures differ widely, depending largely
  on latitude. Thus, New Orleans, La., at 30° N latitude, and International Falls,
  Minn., at 49° N, have respective January temperature averages of 55 °F (13 °C) and
  3 °F (−16° C). In the north, therefore, precipitation often comes as snow, often
  driven by furious winds; farther south, cold rain alternates with sleet and occasional
  snow. Southern Florida is the only dependably warm part of the East, though “polar
  outbursts” have been known to bring temperatures below 0 °F (−18 °C) as far south
  as Tallahassee. The main uniformity of Eastern weather in wintertime is the expectation
  of frequent change.Winter climate on the West Coast is very different. A great spiraling
  mass of relatively warm, moist air spreads south from the Aleutian Islands of Alaska,
  its semipermanent front producing gloomy overcast and drizzles that hang over the
  Pacific Northwest all winter long, occasionally reaching southern California, which
  receives nearly all of its rain at this time of year. This Pacific air brings mild
  temperatures along the length of the coast; the average January day in Seattle,
  Wash., ranges between 33 and 44 °F (1 and 7 °C) and in Los Angeles between 45 and
  64 °F (7 and 18 °C). In southern California, however, rains are separated by long
  spells of fair weather, and the whole region is a winter haven for those seeking
  refuge from less agreeable weather in other parts of the country. The Intermontane
  Region is similar to the Pacific Coast, but with much less rainfall and a considerably
  wider range of temperatures.During the summer there is a reversal of the air masses,
  and east of the Rockies the change resembles the summer monsoon of Southeast Asia.
  As the midcontinent heats up, the cold Canadian air mass weakens and retreats, pushed
  north by an aggressive mass of warm, moist air from the Gulf. The great winter temperature
  differential between North and South disappears as the hot, soggy blanket spreads
  from the Gulf coast to the Canadian border. Heat and humidity are naturally most
  oppressive in the South, but there is little comfort in the more northern latitudes.
  In Houston, Texas, the temperature on a typical July day reaches 93 °F (34 °C),
  with relative humidity averaging near 75 percent, but Minneapolis, Minn., more than
  1,000 miles north, is only slightly cooler and less humid.Since the Gulf air is
  unstable as well as wet, convectional and frontal summer thunderstorms are endemic
  east of the Rockies, accounting for a majority of total summer rain. These storms
  usually drench small areas with short-lived, sometimes violent downpours, so that
  crops in one Midwestern county may prosper, those in another shrivel in drought,
  and those in yet another be flattened by hailstones. Relief from the humid heat
  comes in the northern Midwest from occasional outbursts of cool Canadian air; small
  but more consistent relief is found downwind from the Great Lakes and at high elevations
  in the Appalachians. East of the Rockies, however, U.S. summers are distinctly uncomfortable,
  and air conditioning is viewed as a desirable amenity in most areas.The Pacific
  Region: GeographyEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Again, the Pacific regime is different.
  The moist Aleutian air retreats northward, to be replaced by mild, stable air from
  over the subtropical but cool waters of the Pacific, and except in the mountains
  the Pacific Coast is nearly rainless though often foggy. In the meanwhile, a small
  but potent mass of dry hot air raises temperatures to blistering levels over much
  of the intermontane Southwest. In Yuma, Ariz., for example, the normal temperature
  in July reaches 107 °F (42 °C), while nearby Death Valley, Calif., holds the national
  record, 134 °F (57 °C). During its summer peak this scorching air mass spreads from
  the Pacific margin as far as Texas on the east and Idaho to the north, turning the
  whole interior basin into a summer desert.Over most of the United States, as in
  most continental climates, spring and autumn are agreeable but disappointingly brief.
  Autumn is particularly idyllic in the East, with a romantic Indian summer of ripening
  corn and brilliantly coloured foliage and of mild days and frosty nights. The shift
  in dominance between marine and continental air masses, however, spawns furious
  weather in some regions. Along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, for example, autumn
  is the season for hurricanes—the American equivalent of typhoons of the Asian Pacific—which
  rage northward from the warm tropics to create havoc along the Gulf and Atlantic
  coasts as far north as New England. The Mississippi valley holds the dubious distinction
  of recording more tornadoes than any other area on Earth. These violent and often
  deadly storms usually occur over relatively small areas and are confined largely
  to spring and early summer.The bioclimatic regionsThree first-order bioclimatic
  zones encompass most of the coterminous United States—regions in which climatic
  conditions are similar enough to dictate similar conditions of mature (zonal) soil
  and potential climax vegetation (i.e., the assemblage of plants that would grow
  and reproduce indefinitely given stable climate and average conditions of soil and
  drainage). These are the Humid East, the Humid Pacific Coast, and the Dry West.
  In addition, the boundary zone between the Humid East and the Dry West is so large
  and important that it constitutes a separate region, the Humid–Arid Transition.
  Finally, because the Western Cordillera contains an intricate mosaic of climatic
  types, largely determined by local elevation and exposure, it is useful to distinguish
  the Western Mountain Climate. The first three zones, however, are very diverse and
  require further breakdown, producing a total of 10 main bioclimatic regions. For
  two reasons, the boundaries of these bioclimatic regions are much less distinct
  than boundaries of landform regions. First, climate varies from year to year, especially
  in boundary zones, whereas landforms obviously do not. Second, regions of climate,
  vegetation, and soils coincide generally but sometimes not precisely. Boundaries,
  therefore, should be interpreted as zonal and transitional, and rarely should be
  considered as sharp lines in the landscape.For all of their indistinct boundaries,
  however, these bioclimatic regions have strong and easily recognized identities.
  Such regional identity is strongly reinforced when a particular area falls entirely
  within a single bioclimatic region and at the same time a single landform region.
  The result—as in the Piedmont South, the central Midwest, or the western Great Plains—is
  a landscape with an unmistakable regional personality.The Humid EastThe largest
  and in some ways the most important of the bioclimatic zones, the Humid East was
  where the Europeans first settled, tamed the land, and adapted to American conditions.
  In early times almost all of this territory was forested, a fact of central importance
  in American history that profoundly influenced both soils and wildlife. As in most
  of the world’s humid lands, soluble minerals have been leached from the earth, leaving
  a great family of soils called pedalfers, rich in relatively insoluble iron and
  aluminum compounds.Both forests and soils, however, differ considerably within this
  vast region. Since rainfall is ample and summers are warm everywhere, the main differences
  result from the length and severity of winters, which determine the length of the
  growing season. Winter, obviously, differs according to latitude, so that the Humid
  East is sliced into four great east–west bands of soils and vegetation, with progressively
  more amenable winters as one travels southward. These changes occur very gradually,
  however, and the boundaries therefore are extremely subtle.The Sub-Boreal Forest
  Region is the northernmost of these bands. It is only a small and discontinuous
  part of the United States, representing the tattered southern fringe of the vast
  Canadian taiga—a scrubby forest dominated by evergreen needle-leaf species that
  can endure the ferocious winters and reproduce during the short, erratic summers.
  Average growing seasons are less than 120 days, though localities in Michigan’s
  Upper Peninsula have recorded frost-free periods lasting as long as 161 days and
  as short as 76 days. Soils of this region that survived the scour of glaciation
  are miserably thin podzols—heavily leached, highly acid, and often interrupted by
  extensive stretches of bog. Most attempts at farming in the region long since have
  been abandoned.Farther south lies the Humid Microthermal Zone of milder winters
  and longer summers. Large broadleaf trees begin to predominate over the evergreens,
  producing a mixed forest of greater floristic variety and economic value that is
  famous for its brilliant autumn colours. As the forest grows richer in species,
  sterile podzols give way to more productive gray-brown podzolic soils, stained and
  fertilized with humus. Although winters are warmer than in the Sub-Boreal zone,
  and although the Great Lakes help temper the bitterest cold, January temperatures
  ordinarily average below freezing, and a winter without a few days of subzero temperatures
  is uncommon. Everywhere, the ground is solidly frozen and snow covered for several
  months of the year.Still farther south are the Humid Subtropics. The region’s northern
  boundary is one of the country’s most significant climatic lines: the approximate
  northern limit of a growing season of 180–200 days, the outer margin of cotton growing,
  and, hence, of the Old South. Most of the South lies in the Piedmont and Coastal
  Plain, for higher elevations in the Appalachians cause a peninsula of Northern mixed
  forest to extend as far south as northern Georgia. The red-brown podzolic soil,
  once moderately fertile, has been severely damaged by overcropping and burning.
  Thus much of the region that once sustained a rich, broadleaf-forest flora now supports
  poor piney woods. Throughout the South, summers are hot, muggy, long, and disagreeable;
  Dixie’s “frosty mornings” bring a welcome respite in winter.The southern margins
  of Florida contain the only real tropics in the coterminous United States; it is
  an area in which frost is almost unknown. Hot, rainy summers alternate with warm
  and somewhat drier winters, with a secondary rainfall peak during the autumn hurricane
  season—altogether a typical monsoonal regime. Soils and vegetation are mostly immature,
  however, since southern Florida rises so slightly above sea level that substantial
  areas, such as the Everglades, are swampy and often brackish. Peat and sand frequently
  masquerade as soil, and much of the vegetation is either salt-loving mangrove or
  sawgrass prairie.The Humid Pacific CoastThe western humid region differs from its
  eastern counterpart in so many ways as to be a world apart. Much smaller, it is
  crammed into a narrow littoral belt to the windward of the Sierra–Cascade summit,
  dominated by mild Pacific air, and chopped by irregular topography into an intricate
  mosaic of climatic and biotic habitats. Throughout the region rainfall is extremely
  seasonal, falling mostly in the winter half of the year. Summers are droughty everywhere,
  but the main regional differences come from the length of drought—from about two
  months in humid Seattle, Wash., to nearly five months in semiarid San Diego, Calif.Western
  Washington, Oregon, and northern California lie within a zone that climatologists
  call Marine West Coast. Winters are raw, overcast, and drizzly—not unlike northwestern
  Europe—with subfreezing temperatures restricted mainly to the mountains, upon which
  enormous snow accumulations produce local alpine glaciers. Summers, by contrast,
  are brilliantly cloudless, cool, and frequently foggy along the West Coast and somewhat
  warmer in the inland valleys. This mild marine climate produces some of the world’s
  greatest forests of enormous straight-boled evergreen trees that furnish the United
  States with much of its commercial timber. Mature soils are typical of humid midlatitude
  forestlands, a moderately leached gray-brown podzol.Toward the south, with diminishing
  coastal rain the moist marine climate gradually gives way to California’s tiny but
  much-publicized Mediterranean regime. Although mountainous topography introduces
  a bewildering variety of local environments, scanty winter rains are quite inadequate
  to compensate for the long summer drought, and much of the region has a distinctly
  arid character. For much of the year, cool, stable Pacific air dominates the West
  Coast, bringing San Francisco its famous fogs and Los Angeles its infamous smoggy
  temperature inversions. Inland, however, summer temperatures reach blistering levels,
  so that in July, while Los Angeles expects a normal daily maximum of 83 °F (28 °C),
  Fresno expects 100 °F (38 °C) and is climatically a desert. As might be expected,
  Mediterranean California contains a huge variety of vegetal habitats, but the commonest
  perhaps is the chaparral, a drought-resistant, scrubby woodland of twisted hard-leafed
  trees, picturesque but of little economic value. Chaparral is a pyrophytic (fire-loving)
  vegetation—i.e., under natural conditions its growth and form depend on regular
  burning. These fires constitute a major environmental hazard in the suburban hills
  above Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay, especially in autumn, when hot dry Santa
  Ana winds from the interior regularly convert brush fires into infernos. Soils are
  similarly varied, but most of them are light in colour and rich in soluble minerals,
  qualities typical of subarid soils.The Dry WestIn the United States, to speak of
  dry areas is to speak of the West. It covers an enormous region beyond the dependable
  reach of moist oceanic air, occupying the entire Intermontane area and sprawling
  from Canada to Mexico across the western part of the Great Plains. To Americans
  nurtured in the Humid East, this vast territory across the path of all transcontinental
  travelers has been harder to tame than any other—and no region has so gripped the
  national imagination as this fierce and dangerous land.In the Dry West nothing matters
  more than water. Thus, though temperatures may differ radically from place to place,
  the really important regional differences depend overwhelmingly on the degree of
  aridity, whether an area is extremely dry and hence desert or semiarid and therefore
  steppe.Americans of the 19th century were preoccupied by the myth of a Great American
  Desert, which supposedly occupied more than one-third of the entire country. True
  desert, however, is confined to the Southwest, with patchy outliers elsewhere, all
  without exception located in the lowland rain shadows of the Cordillera. Vegetation
  in these desert areas varies between nothing at all (a rare circumstance confined
  mainly to salt flats and sand dunes) to a low cover of scattered woody scrub and
  short-lived annuals that burst into flamboyant bloom after rains. Soils are usually
  thin, light-coloured, and very rich with mineral salts. In some areas wind erosion
  has removed fine-grained material, leaving behind desert pavement, a barren veneer
  of broken rock.Most of the West, however, lies in the semiarid region, in which
  rainfall is scanty but adequate to support a thin cover of short bunchgrass, commonly
  alternating with scrubby brush. Here, as in the desert, soils fall into the large
  family of the pedocals, rich in calcium and other soluble minerals, but in the slightly
  wetter environments of the West, they are enriched with humus from decomposed grass
  roots. Under the proper type of management, these chestnut-coloured steppe soils
  have the potential to be very fertile.Weather in the West resembles that of other
  dry regions of the world, often extreme, violent, and reliably unreliable. Rainfall,
  for example, obeys a cruel natural law: as total precipitation decreases, it becomes
  more undependable. John Steinbeck’s novel The Grapes of Wrath describes the problems
  of a family enticed to the arid frontier of Oklahoma during a wet period only to
  be driven out by the savage drought of the 1930s that turned the western Great Plains
  into the great American Dust Bowl. Temperatures in the West also fluctuate convulsively
  within short periods, and high winds are infamous throughout the region.The Humid–Arid
  TransitionEast of the Rockies all climatic boundaries are gradational. None, however,
  is so important or so imperceptibly subtle as the boundary zone that separates the
  Humid East from the Dry West and that alternates unpredictably between arid and
  humid conditions from year to year. Stretching approximately from Texas to North
  Dakota in an ill-defined band between the 95th and 100th meridians, this transitional
  region deserves separate recognition, partly because of its great size, and partly
  because of the fine balance between surplus and deficit rainfall, which produces
  a unique and valuable combination of soils, flora, and fauna. The native vegetation,
  insofar as it can be reconstructed, was prairie, the legendary sea of tall, deep-rooted
  grass now almost entirely tilled and planted to grains. Soils, often of loessial
  derivation, include the enormously productive chernozem (black earth) in the north,
  with reddish prairie soils of nearly equal fertility in the south. Throughout the
  region temperatures are severely continental, with bitterly cold winters in the
  north and scorching summers everywhere.The western edge of the prairie fades gradually
  into the shortgrass steppe of the High Plains, the change a function of diminishing
  rainfall. The eastern edge, however, represents one of the few major discordances
  between a climatic and biotic boundary in the United States, for the grassland penetrates
  the eastern forest in a great salient across humid Illinois and Indiana. Many scholars
  believe this part of the prairie was artificially induced by repeated burning and
  consequent destruction of the forest margins by Indians.The Western mountainsThroughout
  the Cordillera and Intermontane regions, irregular topography shatters the grand
  bioclimatic pattern into an intricate mosaic of tiny regions that differ drastically
  according to elevation and exposure. No small- or medium-scale map can accurately
  record such complexity, and mountainous parts of the West are said, noncommittally,
  to have a “mountain climate.” Lowlands are usually dry, but increasing elevation
  brings lower temperature, decreased evaporation, and—if a slope faces prevailing
  winds—greater precipitation. Soils vary wildly from place to place, but vegetation
  is fairly predictable. From the desert or steppe of intermontane valleys, a climber
  typically ascends into parklike savanna, then through an orderly sequence of increasingly
  humid and boreal forests until, if the range is high enough, one reaches the timberline
  and Arctic tundra. The very highest peaks are snow-capped, although permanent glaciers
  rarely occur outside the cool humid highlands of the Pacific Northwest.Peirce F.
  LewisPlant lifeThe dominant features of the vegetation are indicated by the terms
  forest, grassland, desert, and alpine tundra.A coniferous forest of white and red
  pine, hemlock, spruce, jack pine, and balsam fir extends interruptedly in a narrow
  strip near the Canadian border from Maine to Minnesota and southward along the Appalachian
  Mountains. There may be found smaller stands of tamarack, spruce, paper birch, willow,
  alder, and aspen or poplar. Southward, a transition zone of mixed conifers and deciduous
  trees gives way to a hardwood forest of broad-leaved trees. This forest, with varying
  mixtures of maple, oak, ash, locust, linden, sweet gum, walnut, hickory, sycamore,
  beech, and the more southerly tulip tree, once extended uninterruptedly from New
  England to Missouri and eastern Texas. Pines are prominent on the Atlantic and Gulf
  coastal plain and adjacent uplands, often occurring in nearly pure stands called
  pine barrens. Pitch, longleaf, slash, shortleaf, Virginia, and loblolly pines are
  commonest. Hickory and various oaks combine to form a significant part of this forest,
  with magnolia, white cedar, and ash often seen. In the frequent swamps, bald cypress,
  tupelo, and white cedar predominate. Pines, palmettos, and live oaks are replaced
  at the southern tip of Florida by the more tropical royal and thatch palms, figs,
  satinwood, and mangrove.The grasslands occur principally in the Great Plains area
  and extend westward into the intermontane basins and benchlands of the Rocky Mountains.
  Numerous grasses such as buffalo, grama, side oat, bunch, needle, and wheat grass,
  together with many kinds of herbs, make up the plant cover. Coniferous forests cover
  the lesser mountains and high plateaus of the Rockies, Cascades, and Sierra Nevada.
  Ponderosa (yellow) pine, Douglas fir, western red cedar, western larch, white pine,
  lodgepole pine, several spruces, western hemlock, grand fir, red fir, and the lofty
  redwood are the principal trees of these forests. The densest growth occurs west
  of the Cascade and Coast ranges in Washington, Oregon, and northern California,
  where the trees are often 100 feet or more in height. There the forest floor is
  so dark that only ferns, mosses, and a few shade-loving shrubs and herbs may be
  found.Arizona: Saguaro National MonumentEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The alpine
  tundra, located in the coterminous United States only in the mountains above the
  limit of trees, consists principally of small plants that bloom brilliantly for
  a short season. Sagebrush is the most common plant of the arid basins and semideserts
  west of the Rocky Mountains, but juniper, nut pine, and mountain mahogany are often
  found on the slopes and low ridges. The desert, extending from southeastern California
  to Texas, is noted for the many species of cactus, some of which grow to the height
  of trees, and for the Joshua tree and other yuccas, creosote bush, mesquite, and
  acacias.The United States is rich in the variety of its native forest trees, some
  of which, as the species of sequoia, are the most massive known. More than 1,000
  species and varieties have been described, of which almost 200 are of economic value,
  either because of the timber and other useful products that they yield or by reason
  of their importance in forestry.Besides the native flowering plants, estimated at
  between 20,000 to 25,000 species, many hundreds of species introduced from other
  regions—chiefly Europe, Asia, and tropical America—have become naturalized. A large
  proportion of these are common annual weeds of fields, pastures, and roadsides.
  In some districts these naturalized “aliens” constitute 50 percent or more of the
  total plant population.Paul H. OehserReed C. RollinsEd.Animal lifeWith most of North
  America, the United States lies in the Nearctic faunistic realm, a region containing
  an assemblage of species similar to Eurasia and North Africa but sharply different
  from the tropical and subtropical zones to the south. Main regional differences
  correspond roughly with primary climatic and vegetal patterns. Thus, for example,
  the animal communities of the Dry West differ sharply from those of the Humid East
  and from those of the Pacific Coast. Because animals tend to range over wider areas
  than plants, faunal regions are generally coarser than vegetal regions and harder
  to delineate sharply.The animal geography of the United States, however, is far
  from a natural pattern, for European settlement produced a series of environmental
  changes that grossly altered the distribution of animal communities. First, many
  species were hunted to extinction or near extinction, most conspicuously, perhaps,
  the American bison, which ranged by the millions nearly from coast to coast but
  now rarely lives outside of zoos and wildlife preserves. Second, habitats were upset
  or destroyed throughout most of the country—forests cut, grasslands plowed and overgrazed,
  and migration paths interrupted by fences, railroads, and highways. Third, certain
  introduced species found hospitable niches and, like the English sparrow, spread
  over huge areas, often preempting the habitats of native animals. Fourth, though
  their effects are not fully understood, chemical biocides such as DDT were used
  for so long and in such volume that they are believed at least partly responsible
  for catastrophic mortality rates among large mammals and birds, especially predators
  high on the food chain. Fifth, there has been a gradual northward migration of certain
  tropical and subtropical insects, birds, and mammals, perhaps encouraged by gradual
  climatic warming. In consequence, many native animals have been reduced to tiny
  fractions of their former ranges or exterminated completely, while other animals,
  both native and introduced, have found the new anthropocentric environment well
  suited to their needs, with explosive effects on their populations. The coyote,
  opossum, armadillo, and several species of deer are among the animals that now occupy
  much larger ranges than they once did.Peirce F. LewisArrangement of the account
  of the distribution of the fauna according to the climatic and vegetal regions has
  the merit that it can be compared further with the distribution of insects and of
  other invertebrates, some of which may be expected to fall into the same patterns
  as the vertebrates, while others, with different modes or different ages of dispersal,
  have geographic patterns of their own.The transcontinental zone of coniferous forest
  at the north, the taiga, and the tundra zone into which it merges at the northern
  limit of tree growth are strikingly paralleled by similar vertical zones in the
  Rockies, and on Mount Washington in the east, where the area above the timberline
  and below the snow line is often inhabited with tundra animals like the ptarmigan
  and the white Parnassius butterflies, while the spruce and other conifers below
  the timberline form a belt sharply set off from the grassland or hardwood forest
  or desert at still lower altitudes.A whole series of important types of animals
  spread beyond the limits of such regions or zones, sometimes over most of the continent.
  Aquatic animals, in particular, may live equally in forest and plains, in the Gulf
  states, and at the Canadian border. Such widespread animals include the white-tailed
  (Virginia) deer and black bear, the puma (though only in the remotest parts of its
  former range) and bobcat, the river otter (though now rare in inland areas south
  of the Great Lakes) and mink, and the beaver and muskrat. The distinctive coyote
  ranges over all of western North America and eastward as far as Maine. The snapping
  turtle ranges from the Atlantic coast to the Rocky Mountains.In the northern coniferous
  forest zone, or taiga, the relations of animals with European or Eurasian representatives
  are numerous, and this zone is also essentially circumpolar. The relations are less
  close than in the Arctic forms, but the moose, beaver, hare, red fox, otter, wolverine,
  and wolf are recognizably related to Eurasian animals. Even some fishes, like the
  whitefishes (Coregonidae), the yellow perch, and the pike, exhibit this kind of
  Old World–New World relation. A distinctively North American animal in this taiga
  assemblage is the Canadian porcupine.The hardwood forest area of the eastern and
  the southeastern pinelands compose the most important of the faunal regions within
  the United States. A great variety of fishes, amphibians, and reptiles of this region
  have related forms in East Asia, and this pattern of representation is likewise
  found in the flora. This area is rich in catfishes, minnows, and suckers. The curious
  ganoid fishes, the bowfin and the gar, are ancient types. The spoonbill cat, a remarkable
  type of sturgeon in the lower Mississippi, is represented elsewhere in the world
  only in the Yangtze in China. The Appalachian region is headquarters for the salamanders
  of the world, with no less than seven of the eight families of this large group
  of amphibians represented; no other continent has more than three of the eight families
  together. The eellike sirens and amphiumas (congo snakes) are confined to the southeastern
  states. The lungless salamanders of the family Plethodontidae exhibit a remarkable
  variety of genera and a number of species centring in the Appalachians. There is
  a great variety of frogs, and these include tree frogs whose main development is
  South American and Australian. The emydid freshwater turtles of the southeast parallel
  those of East Asia to a remarkable degree, though the genus Clemmys is the only
  one represented in both regions. Much the same is true of the water snakes, pit
  vipers, rat snakes, and green snakes, though still others are peculiarly American.
  The familiar alligator is a form with an Asiatic relative, the only other living
  true alligator being a species in central China.In its mammals and birds the southeastern
  fauna is less sharply distinguished from the life to the north and west and is less
  directly related to that of East Asia. The forest is the home of the white-tailed
  deer, the black bear, the gray fox, the raccoon, and the common opossum. The wild
  turkey and the extinct hosts of the passenger pigeon were characteristic. There
  is a remarkable variety of woodpeckers. The birdlife in general tends to differ
  from that of Eurasia in the presence of birds, like the tanagers, American orioles,
  and hummingbirds, that belong to South American families. Small mammals abound with
  types of the worldwide rodent family Cricetidae, and with distinctive moles and
  shrews.Most distinctive of the grassland animals proper is the American bison (see
  photograph), whose nearly extinct European relative, the wisent, is a forest dweller.
  The most distinctive of the American hoofed animals is the pronghorn, or prongbuck,
  which represents a family intermediate between the deer and the true antelopes in
  that it sheds its horns like a deer but retains the bony horn cores. The pronghorn
  is perhaps primarily a desert mammal, but it formerly ranged widely into the shortgrass
  plains. Everywhere in open country in the West there are conspicuous and distinctive
  rodents. The burrowing pocket gopher is peculiarly American, rarely seen making
  its presence known by pushed-out mounds of earth. The ground squirrels of the genus
  Citellus are related to those of Central Asia, and resemble them in habit; in North
  America the gregarious prairie dog is a closely related form. The American badger
  (see photograph), not especially related to the badger of Europe, has its headquarters
  in the grasslands. The prairie chicken is a bird distinctive of the plains region,
  which is invaded everywhere by birds from both the east and the west.The Southwestern
  deserts are a paradise for reptiles. Distinctive lizards such as the poisonous Gila
  monster abound, and the rattlesnakes, of which only a few species are found elsewhere
  in the United States, are common there. Desert reptile species often range to the
  Pacific Coast and northward into the Great Basin. Noteworthy mammals are the graceful
  bipedal kangaroo rat (almost exlusively nocturnal; see photograph), the ring-tailed
  cat, a relative of the raccoon, and the piglike peccary.The Rocky Mountains and
  other western ranges afford distinctive habitats for rock- and cliff-dwelling hoofed
  animals and rodents. The small pikas, related to the rabbit, inhabit talus areas
  at high altitudes as they do in the mountain ranges of East Asia. Marmots live in
  the Rockies as in the Alps. Every western range formerly had its own race of mountain
  sheep. At the north the Rocky Mountain goat lives at high altitudes—it is more properly
  a goat antelope, related to the takin of the mountains of western China. The dipper,
  remarkable for its habit of feeding in swift-flowing streams, though otherwise a
  bird without special aquatic adaptations, is a Rocky Mountain form with relatives
  in Asia and Europe.In the Pacific region the extremely distinctive primitive tailed
  frog Ascaphus, which inhabits icy mountain brooks, represents a family by itself,
  perhaps more nearly related to the frogs of New Zealand than to more familiar types.
  The Cascades and Sierras form centres for salamanders of the families Ambystomoidae
  and Plethodontidae second only to the Appalachians, and there are also distinctive
  newts. The burrowing lizards, of the well-defined family Anniellidae, are found
  only in a limited area in coastal California. The only family of birds distinctive
  of North America, that of the wren-tits, Chamaeidae, is found in the chaparral of
  California. The mountain beaver, or sewellel (which is not at all beaverlike), is
  likewise a type peculiar to North America, confined to the Cascades and Sierras,
  and there are distinct kinds of moles in the Pacific area.The mammals of the two
  coasts are strikingly different, though true seals (the harbour seal and the harp
  seal) are found on both. The sea lions, with longer necks and with projecting ears,
  are found only in the Pacific—the California sea lion, the more northern Steller’s
  sea lion, and the fur seal. On the East Coast the larger rivers of Florida are inhabited
  by the Florida manatee, or sea cow, a close relative of the more widespread and
  more distinctively marine West Indian species.Karl Patterson SchmidtEd.Settlement
  patternsUnited States: population densityEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Although the
  land that now constitutes the United States was occupied and much affected by diverse
  Indian cultures over many millennia, these pre-European settlement patterns have
  had virtually no impact upon the contemporary nation—except locally, as in parts
  of New Mexico. A benign habitat permitted a huge contiguous tract of settled land
  to materialize across nearly all the eastern half of the United States and within
  substantial patches of the West. The vastness of the land, the scarcity of labour,
  and the abundance of migratory opportunities in a land replete with raw physical
  resources contributed to exceptional human mobility and a quick succession of ephemeral
  forms of land use and settlement. Human endeavours have greatly transformed the
  landscape, but such efforts have been largely destructive. Most of the pre-European
  landscape in the United States was so swiftly and radically altered that it is difficult
  to conjecture intelligently about its earlier appearance.The overall impression
  of the settled portion of the American landscape, rural or urban, is one of disorder
  and incoherence, even in areas of strict geometric survey. The individual landscape
  unit is seldom in visual harmony with its neighbour, so that, however sound in design
  or construction the single structure may be, the general effect is untidy. These
  attributes have been intensified by the acute individualism of the American, vigorous
  speculation in land and other commodities, a strongly utilitarian attitude toward
  the land and the treasures above and below it, and government policy and law. The
  landscape is also remarkable for its extensive transportation facilities, which
  have greatly influenced the configuration of the land.Another special characteristic
  of American settlement, one that became obvious only by the mid-20th century, is
  the convergence of rural and urban modes of life. The farmsteads—and rural folk
  in general—have become increasingly urbanized, and agricultural operations have
  become more automated, while the metropolis grows more gelatinous, unfocused, and
  pseudo-bucolic along its margins.Rural settlementPatterns of rural settlement indicate
  much about the history, economy, society, and minds of those who created them as
  well as about the land itself. The essential design of rural activity in the United
  States bears a strong family resemblance to that of other neo-European lands, such
  as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, or tsarist Siberia—places
  that have undergone rapid occupation and exploitation by immigrants intent upon
  short-term development and enrichment. In all such areas, under novel social and
  political conditions and with a relative abundance of territory and physical resources,
  ideas and institutions derived from a relatively stable medieval or early modern
  Europe have undergone major transformation. Further, these are nonpeasant countrysides,
  alike in having failed to achieve the intimate symbiosis of people and habitat,
  the humanized rural landscapes characteristic of many relatively dense, stable,
  earthbound communities in parts of Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America.Early
  models of land allocationFrom the beginning the prevalent official policy of the
  British (except between 1763 and 1776) and then of the U.S. government was to promote
  agricultural and other settlement—to push the frontier westward as fast as physical
  and economic conditions permitted. The British crown’s grants of large, often vaguely
  specified tracts to individual proprietors or companies enabled the grantees to
  draw settlers by the sale or lease of land at attractive prices or even by outright
  gift.Of the numerous attempts at group colonization, the most notable effort was
  the theocratic and collectivist New England town that flourished, especially in
  Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire, during the first century of settlement.
  The town, the basic unit of government and comparable in area to townships in other
  states, allotted both rural and village parcels to single families by group decision.
  Contrary to earlier scholarly belief, in all but a few cases settlement was spatially
  dispersed in the socially cohesive towns, at least until about 1800. The relatively
  concentrated latter-day villages persist today as amoeba-like entities straggling
  along converging roads, neither fully rural nor agglomerated in form. The only latter-day
  settlement experiment of notable magnitude to achieve enduring success was a series
  of Mormon settlements in the Great Basin region of Utah and adjacent states, with
  their tightly concentrated farm villages reminiscent of the New England model. Other
  efforts have been made along ethnic, religious, or political lines, but success
  has been at best brief and fragile.Creating the national domainWith the coming of
  independence and after complex negotiations, the original 13 states surrendered
  to the new national government nearly all their claims to the unsettled western
  lands beyond their boundaries. Some tracts, however, were reserved for disposal
  to particular groups. Thus, the Western Reserve of northeastern Ohio gave preferential
  treatment to natives of Connecticut, while the military tracts in Ohio and Indiana
  were used as bonus payments to veterans of the American Revolution.A federally administered
  national domain was created, to which the great bulk of the territory acquired in
  1803 in the Louisiana Purchase and later beyond the Mississippi and in 1819 in Florida
  was consigned. The only major exceptions were the public lands of Texas, which were
  left within that state’s jurisdiction; such earlier French and Spanish land grants
  as were confirmed, often after tortuous litigation; and some Indian lands. In sharp
  contrast to the slipshod methods of colonial land survey and disposal, the federal
  land managers expeditiously surveyed, numbered, and mapped their territory in advance
  of settlement, beginning with Ohio in the 1780s, then sold or deeded it to settlers
  under inviting terms at a number of regional land offices.The design universally
  followed in the new survey system (except within the French, Spanish, and Indian
  grants) was a simple, efficient rectangular scheme. Townships were laid out as blocks,
  each six by six miles in size, oriented with the compass directions. Thirty-six
  sections, each one square mile, or 640 acres (260 hectares), in size, were designated
  within each township; and public roads were established along section lines and,
  where needed, along half-section lines. At irregular intervals, offsets in survey
  lines and roads were introduced to allow for the Earth’s curvature. Individual property
  lines were coincident with, or parallel to, survey lines, and this pervasive rectangularity
  generally carried over into the geometry of fields and fences or into the townsites
  later superimposed upon the basic rural survey.This all-encompassing checkerboard
  pattern is best appreciated from an airplane window over Iowa or Kansas. There,
  one sees few streams or other natural features and few diagonal highways or railroads
  interrupting the overwhelming squareness of the landscape. A systematic rectangular
  layout, rather less rigorous in form, also appears in much of Texas and in those
  portions of Maine, western New York and Pennsylvania, and southern Georgia that
  were settled after the 1780s.Distribution of rural landsSince its formation, Congress
  has enacted a series of complex schemes for distribution of the national domain.
  The most famous of these plans was the Homestead Act of 1862, which offered title
  to 160 acres to individual settlers, subject only to residence for a certain period
  of time and to the making of minimal improvements to the land thus acquired. The
  legal provisions of such acts have varied with time as the nature of farming technology
  and of the remaining lands have changed, but their general effect has been to perpetuate
  the Jeffersonian ideal of a republic in which yeoman farmers own and till self-sufficient
  properties.The program was successful in providing private owners with relatively
  choice lands, aside from parcels reserved for schools and various township and municipal
  uses. More than one-third of the national territory, however, is still owned by
  federal and state governments, with much of this land in forest and wildlife preserves.
  A large proportion of this land is in the West and is unsuited for intensive agriculture
  or grazing because of the roughness, dryness, or salinity of the terrain; much of
  it is leased out for light grazing or for timber cutting.Patterns of farm lifeDuring
  the classic period of American rural life, around 1900, the typical American lived
  or worked on a farm or was economically dependent upon farmers. In contrast to rural
  life in many other parts of the world, the farm family lived on an isolated farmstead
  some distance from town and often from farm neighbours; its property averaged less
  than one-quarter square mile. This farmstead varied in form and content with local
  tradition and economy. In particular, barn types were localized—for example, the
  tobacco barns of the South, the great dairy barns of Wisconsin, or the general-purpose
  forebay barns of southeastern Pennsylvania—as were modes of fencing. In general,
  however, the farmstead contained dwelling, barn, storage and sheds for small livestock
  and equipment, a small orchard, and a kitchen garden. A woodlot might be found in
  the least-accessible or least-fertile part of the farm.Successions of such farms
  were connected with one another and with the towns by means of a dense, usually
  rectangular lattice of roads, largely unimproved at the time. The hamlets, villages,
  and smaller cities were arrayed at relatively regular intervals, with size and affluence
  determined in large part by the presence and quality of rail service or status as
  the county seat. But, among people who have been historically rural, individualistic,
  and antiurban in bias, many services normally located in urban places might be found
  in rustic settings. Thus, much retail business was transacted by means of itinerant
  peddlers, while small shops for the fabrication, distribution, or repair of various
  items were often located in isolated farmsteads, as were many post offices.Social
  activity also tended to be widely dispersed among numerous rural churches, schools,
  or grange halls; and the climactic event of the year might well be the county fair,
  political rally, or religious encampment—again on a rural site. Not the least symptomatic
  sign of the strong tendency toward spatial isolation are the countless family burial
  plots or community cemeteries so liberally distributed across the countryside.Regional
  small-town patternsThere has been much regional variation among smaller villages
  and hamlets, but such phenomena have received relatively little attention from students
  of American culture or geography. The distinctive New England village, of course,
  is generally recognized and cherished: it consists of a loose clustering of white
  frame buildings, including a church (usually Congregationalist or Unitarian), town
  hall, shops, and stately homes with tall shade trees around the central green, or
  commons—a grassy expanse that may contain a bandstand and monuments or flowers.
  Derivative village forms were later carried westward to sections of the northern
  Midwest.Less widely known but equally distinctive is the town morphology characteristic
  of the Midland, or Pennsylvanian, culture area and most fully developed in southeastern
  and central Pennsylvania and Piedmont Maryland. It differs totally from the New
  England model in density, building materials, and general appearance. Closely packed,
  often contiguous buildings—mostly brick, but sometimes stone, frame, or stucco—abut
  directly on a sidewalk, which is often paved with brick and usually thickly planted
  with maple, sycamore, or other shade trees. Such towns are characteristically linear
  in plan, have dwellings intermingled with other types of buildings, have only one
  or two principal streets, and may radiate outward from a central square lined with
  commercial and governmental structures.Midwest States: History and PeopleEncyclopædia
  Britannica, Inc.The most characteristic U.S. small town is the one whose pattern
  evolved in the Midwest. Its simple scheme is usually based on the grid plan. Functions
  are rigidly segregated spatially, with the central business district, consisting
  of closely packed two- or three-story brick buildings, limited exclusively to commercial
  and administrative activity. The residences, generally set well back within spacious
  lots, are peripheral in location, as are most rail facilities, factories, and warehouses.Even
  the modest urbanization of the small town came late to the South. Most urban functions
  long were spatially dispersed—almost totally so in the early Chesapeake Bay country
  or North Carolina—or were performed entirely by the larger plantations dominating
  the economic life of much of the region. When city and town began to materialize
  in the 19th and 20th centuries, they tended to follow the Midwestern model in layout.Although
  quite limited in geographic area, the characteristic villages of the Mormon and
  Hispanic-American districts are of considerable interest. The Mormon settlement
  uncompromisingly followed the ecclesiastically imposed grid plan composed of square
  blocks, each with perhaps only four very large house lots, and the block surrounded
  by extremely wide streets. Those villages in New Mexico in which population and
  culture were derived from Old Mexico were often built according to the standard
  Latin-American plan. The distinctive feature is a central plaza dominated by a Roman
  Catholic church and encircled by low stone or adobe buildings.The rural–urban transitionWeakening
  of the agrarian idealThe United States has had little success in achieving or maintaining
  the ideal of the family farm. Through purchase, inheritance, leasing, and other
  means, some of dubious legality, smaller properties have been merged into much larger
  entities. By the late 1980s, for example, when the average farm size had surpassed
  460 acres, farms containing 2,000 or more acres accounted for almost half of all
  farmland and 20 percent of the cropland harvested, even though they comprised less
  than 3 percent of all farms. At the other extreme were those 60 percent of all farms
  that contained fewer than 180 acres and reported less than 15 percent of cropland
  harvested. This trend toward fewer but larger farms has continued.The huge, heavily
  capitalized “neoplantation,” essentially a factory in the field, is especially conspicuous
  in parts of California, Arizona, and the Mississippi Delta, but examples can be
  found in any state. There are also many smaller but intensive operations that call
  for large investments and advanced managerial skills. This trend toward large-scale,
  capital-intensive farm enterprise has been paralleled by a sharp drop in rural farm
  population—a slump from the all-time high of some 32,000,000 in the early 20th century
  to about 5,000,000 in the late 1980s; but even in 1940, when farm folk still numbered
  more than 30,000,000, nearly 40 percent of farm operators were tenants, and another
  10 percent were only partial owners.As the agrarian population has dwindled, so
  too has its immediate impact lessened, though less swiftly, in economic and political
  matters. The rural United States, however, has been the source of many of the nation’s
  values and images. The United States has become a highly urbanized, technologically
  advanced society far removed in daily life from cracker barrel, barnyard, corral,
  or logging camp. Although Americans have gravitated, sometimes reluctantly, to the
  big city, in the daydreams and assumptions that guide many sociopolitical decisions,
  the memory of a rapidly vanishing agrarian America is well noted. This is revealed
  not only in the works of contemporary novelists, poets, and painters but also throughout
  the popular arts: in movies, television, soap operas, folklore, country music, political
  oratory, and in much leisure activity.Impact of the motor vehicleSince about 1920
  more genuine change has occurred in American rural life than during the preceding
  three centuries of European settlement in North America. Although the basic explanation
  is the profound social and technological transformations engulfing most of the world,
  the most immediate agent of change has been the internal-combustion engine. The
  automobile, truck, bus, and paved highway have more than supplanted a moribund passenger
  and freight railroad system. While many local rail depots have been boarded up and
  scores of secondary lines have been abandoned, hundreds of thousands of miles of
  old dirt roads have been paved, and a vast system of interstate highways has been
  constructed to connect major cities in a single nonstop network. The net result
  has been a shrinking of travel time and an increase in miles traveled for the individual
  driver, rural or urban.Small towns in the United States have undergone a number
  of changes. Before 1970 towns near highways and urban centres generally prospered;
  while in the less-fortunate towns, where the residents lingered on for the sake
  of relatively cheap housing, downtown businesses often became extinct. From the
  late 1960s until about 1981 the rural and small-town population grew at a faster
  rate than the metropolitan population, the so-called metro–nonmetro turnaround,
  thus reversing more than a century of relatively greater urban growth. Subsequent
  evidence, however, suggests an approach toward equilibrium between the urban and
  rural sectors.As Americans have become increasingly mobile, the visual aspect of
  rural America has altered drastically. The highway has become the central route,
  and many of the functions once confined to the local town or city now stretch for
  many miles along major roads.Reversal of the classic rural dominanceThe metropolitanization
  of life in the United States has not been limited to city, suburb, or exurb; it
  now involves most of the rural area and population. The result has been the decline
  of local crafts and regional peculiarities, quite visibly in such items as farm
  implements, fencing, silos, and housing and in commodities such as clothing or bread.
  In many ways, the countryside is now economically dependent on the city.The city
  dweller is the dominant consumer for products other than those of field, quarry,
  or lumber mill; and city location tends to determine patterns of rural economy rather
  than the reverse. During weekends and the vacation seasons, swarms of city folk
  stream out to second homes in the countryside and to campgrounds, ski runs, beaches,
  boating areas, or hunting and fishing tracts. For many large rural areas, recreation
  is the principal source of income and employment; and such areas as northern New
  England and upstate New York have become playgrounds and sylvan refuges for many
  urban residents.The larger cities reach far into the countryside for their vital
  supplies of water and energy. There is an increasing reliance upon distant coalfields
  to provide fuel for electrical power plants, and cities have gone far afield in
  seeking out rural disposal sites for their ever-growing volumes of garbage.The majority
  of the rural population now lives within daily commuting range of a sizable city.
  This enables many farm residents to operate their farms while, at the same time,
  working part- or full-time at a city job, and it thus helps to prevent the drastic
  decline in rural population that has occurred in remoter parts of the country. Similarly,
  many small towns within the shadow of a metropolis, with fewer and fewer farmers
  to service, have become dormitory satellites, serving residents from nearby cities
  and suburbs.Urban settlementNortheast USA: History and PeopleEncyclopædia Britannica,
  Inc.The United States has moved from a predominantly rural settlement into an urban
  society. In so doing, it has followed the general path that other advanced nations
  have traveled and one along which developing nations have begun to hasten. About
  three-fourths of the population live clustered within officially designated urban
  places and urbanized areas, which account for less than 2 percent of the national
  territory. At least another 15 percent live in dispersed residences that are actually
  urban in economic or social orientation.Classic patterns of siting and growthAlthough
  more than 95 percent of the population was rural during the colonial period and
  for the first years of independence, cities were crucial elements in the settlement
  system from the earliest days. Boston; New Amsterdam (New York City); Jamestown,
  Va.; Charleston, S.C.; and Philadelphia were founded at the same time as the colonies
  they served. Like nearly all other North American colonial towns of consequence,
  they were ocean ports. Until at least the beginning of the 20th century the historical
  geography of U.S. cities was intimately related with that of successive transportation
  systems. The location of successful cities with respect to the areas they served,
  as well as their internal structure, was determined largely by the nature of these
  systems.The colonial cities acted as funnels for the collection and shipment of
  farm and forest products and other raw materials from the interior to trading partners
  in Europe, the Caribbean, or Africa and for the return flow of manufactured goods
  and other locally scarce items, as well as immigrants. Such cities were essentially
  marts and warehouses, and only minimal attention was given to social, military,
  educational, or religious functions. The inadequacy and high cost of overland traffic
  dictated sites along major ocean embayments or river estuaries; the only pre-1800
  nonports worthy of notice were Lancaster and York, both in Pennsylvania, and Williamsburg,
  Va. With the populating of the interior and the spread of a system of canals and
  improved roads, such new cities as Pittsburgh, Pa.; Cincinnati, Ohio; Buffalo, N.Y.;
  and St. Louis, Mo., mushroomed at junctures between various routes or at which modes
  of transport were changed. Older ocean ports, such as New Castle, Del.; Newport,
  R.I.; Charleston, S.C.; Savannah, Ga.; and Portland, Maine, whose locations prevented
  them from serving large hinterlands, tended to stagnate.From about 1850 to 1920
  the success of new cities and the further growth of older ones in large part were
  dependent on their location within the new steam railroad system and on their ability
  to dominate a large tributary territory. Such waterside rail hubs as Buffalo; Toledo,
  Ohio; Chicago; and San Francisco gained population and wealth rapidly, while such
  offspring of the rail era as Atlanta, Ga.; Indianapolis, Ind.; Minneapolis, Minn.;
  Fort Worth, Texas; and Tacoma, Wash., also grew dramatically. Much of the rapid
  industrialization of the 19th and early 20th centuries occurred in places already
  favoured by water or rail transport systems; but in some instances, such as in the
  cities of northeastern Pennsylvania’s anthracite region, some New England mill towns,
  and the textile centres of the Carolina and Virginia Piedmont, manufacturing brought
  about rapid urbanization and the consequent attraction of transport facilities.
  The extraction of gold, silver, copper, coal, iron, and, in the 20th century, gas
  and oil led to rather ephemeral centres—unless these places were able to capitalize
  on local or regional advantages other than minerals.A strong early start, whatever
  the inital economic base may have been, was often the key factor in competition
  among cities. With sufficient early momentum, urban capital and population tended
  to expand almost automatically. The point is illustrated perfectly by the larger
  cities of the northeastern seaboard, from Portland, Maine, through Baltimore, Md.
  The nearby physical wealth is poor to mediocre, and they are now far off-centre
  on the national map; but a prosperous mercantile beginning, good land and sea connections
  with distant places, and a rich local accumulation of talent, capital, and initiative
  were sufficient to bring about the growth of one of the world’s largest concentrations
  of industry, commerce, and people.New factors in municipal developmentThe pre-1900
  development of the American city was almost completely a chronicle of the economics
  of the production, collection, and distribution of physical commodities and basic
  services dictated by geography, but there have been striking deviations from this
  pattern. The physical determinants of urban location and growth have given way to
  social factors. Increasingly, the most successful cities are oriented toward the
  more advanced modes for the production and consumption of services, specifically
  the knowledge, managerial, and recreational industries. The largest cities have
  become more dependent upon corporate headquarters, communications, and the manipulation
  of information for their sustenance. Washington, D.C., is the most obvious example
  of a metropolis in which government and ancillary activities have been the spur
  for vigorous growth; but almost all of the state capitals have displayed a similar
  demographic and economic vitality. Further, urban centres that contain a major college
  or university often have enjoyed remarkable expansion.With the coming of relative
  affluence and abundant leisure to the population and a decrease of labour input
  in industrial processes, a new breed of cities has sprouted across the land: those
  that cater to the pleasure-seeker, vacationer, and the retired—for example, the
  young, flourishing cities of Florida or Nevada and many locations in California,
  Arizona, and Colorado.The automobile as a means of personal transportation was developed
  about the time of World War I, and the American city was catapulted into a radically
  new period, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the further evolution of physical
  form and function. The size, density, and internal structure of the city were previously
  constrained by the limitations of the pedestrian and early mass-transit systems.
  Only the well-to-do could afford horse and carriage or a secluded villa in the countryside.
  Cities were relatively small and compact, with a single clearly defined centre,
  and they grew by accretion along their edges, without any significant spatial hiatuses
  except where commuter railroads linked outlying towns to the largest of metropolises.
  Workers living beyond the immediate vicinity of their work had to locate within
  reach of the few horse-drawn omnibuses or the later electric street railways.The
  universality of the automobile, even among the less affluent, and the parallel proliferation
  of service facilities and highways greatly loosened and fragmented the American
  city, which spread over surrounding rural lands. Older, formerly autonomous towns
  grew swiftly. Many towns became satellites of the larger city or were absorbed.
  Many suburbs and subdivisions arose with single-family homes on lots larger than
  had been possible for the ordinary householder in the city. These communities were
  almost totally dependent on the highway for the flow of commuters, goods, and services,
  and many were located in splendid isolation, separated by tracts of farmland, brush,
  or forest from other such developments. At the major interchanges of the limited-access
  highways, a new form of agglomerated settlement sprang up. In a further elaboration
  of this trend, many larger cities have been girdled by a set of mushrooming complexes.
  These creations of private enterprise embody a novel concept of urban existence:
  a metropolitan module no longer reliant on the central city or its downtown. Usually
  anchored on a cluster of shopping malls and office parks, these “hypersuburbs,”
  whose residents and employees circulate freely within the outer metropolitan ring,
  offer virtually all of the social and economic facilities needed for the modern
  life-style.The new look of the metropolitan areaThe outcome has been a broad, ragged,
  semiurbanized belt of land surrounding each city, large or small, and quite often
  blending imperceptibly into the suburban-exurban halo encircling a neighbouring
  metropolitan centre. There is a great similarity in the makeup and general appearance
  of all such tracts: the planless intermixture of scraps of the rural landscape with
  the fragments of the scattered metropolis; the randomly distributed subdivisions
  or single homes; the vast shopping centres, the large commercial cemeteries, drive-in
  theatres, junkyards, and golf courses and other recreational enterprises; and the
  regional or metropolitan airport, often with its own cluster of factories, warehouses,
  or travel-oriented businesses. The traditional city—unitary, concentric in form,
  with a single well-defined middle—has been replaced by a relatively amorphous, polycentric
  metropolitan sprawl.The inner city of a large U.S. metropolitan area displays some
  traits that are common to the larger centres of all advanced nations. A central
  business district, almost always the oldest section of the city, is surrounded by
  a succession of roughly circular zones, each distinctive in economic and social-ethnic
  character. The symmetry of this scheme is distorted by the irregularities of surface
  and drainage or the effects of radial highways and railroads. Land is most costly,
  and hence land use is most intensive, toward the centre. Major business, financial
  and governmental offices, department stores, and specialty shops dominate the downtown,
  which is usually fringed by a band of factories and warehouses. The outer parts
  of the city, like the suburbs, are mainly residential.With some exceptions—e.g.,
  large apartment complexes in downtown Chicago—people do not reside in the downtown
  areas, and there is a steady downward gradient in population density per unit area
  (and more open land and single-family residences) as one moves from the inner city
  toward the open country. Conversely, there is a general rise in income and social
  status with increasing distance from the core. The sharply defined immigrant neighbourhoods
  of the 19th century generally persist in a somewhat diluted form, though specific
  ethnic groups may have shifted their location. Later migrant groups, notably Southern
  blacks and Latin Americans, generally dominate the more run-down neighbourhoods
  of the inner cities.Individual and collective character of citiesAmerican cities,
  more so than the small-town or agrarian landscape, tend to be the product of a particular
  period rather than of location. The relatively venerable centres of the Eastern
  Seaboard—Boston; Philadelphia; Baltimore, Md.; Albany, N.Y.; Chester, Pa.; Alexandria,
  Va.; or Georgetown (a district of Washington, D.C.), for example—are virtual replicas
  of the fashionable European models of their early period rather than the fruition
  of a regional culture, unlike New Orleans and Santa Fe, N.M., which reflect other
  times and regions. The townscapes of Pittsburgh; Detroit, Mich.; Chicago; and Denver,
  Colo., depict national modes of thought and the technological development of their
  formative years, just as Dallas, Texas; Las Vegas, Nev.; San Diego, Calif.; Tucson,
  Ariz.; and Albuquerque, N.M., proclaim contemporary values and gadgetry more than
  any local distinctiveness. When strong-minded city founders instituted a highly
  individual plan and their successors managed to preserve it—as, for example, in
  Savannah, Ga.; Washington, D.C.; and Salt Lake City, Utah—or when there is a happy
  combination of a spectacular site and appreciative residents—as in San Francisco
  or Seattle, Wash.—a genuine individuality does seem to emerge. Such an identity
  also may develop where immigration has been highly selective, as in such places
  as Miami, Fla.; Phoenix, Ariz.; and Los Angeles.As a group, U.S. cities differ from
  cities in other countries in both type and degree. The national political structure,
  the social inclinations of the people, and the strong outward surge of urban development
  have led to the political fragmentation of metropolises that socially and economically
  are relatively cohesive units. The fact that a single metropolitan area may sprawl
  across numerous incorporated towns and cities, several townships, and two or more
  counties and states has a major impact upon both its appearance and the way it functions.
  Not the least of these effects is a dearth of overall physical and social planning
  (or its ineffectuality when attempted), and the rather chaotic, inharmonious appearance
  of both inner-city and peripheral zones painfully reflects the absence of any effective
  collective action concerning such matters.The American city is a place of sharp
  transitions. Construction, demolition, and reconstruction go on almost ceaselessly,
  though increasing thought has been given to preserving monuments and buildings.
  From present evidence, it would be impossible to guess that New York City and Albany
  date from the 1620s or that Detroit was founded in 1701. Preservation and restoration
  do occur, but often only when it makes sense in terms of tourist revenue. Physical
  and social blight has reached epidemic proportions in the slum areas of the inner
  city; but, despite the wholesale razing of such areas and the subsequent urban-renewal
  projects (sometimes as apartment or commercial developments for the affluent), the
  belief has become widespread that the ills of the U.S. city are incurable, especially
  with the increasing flight of capital, tax revenue, and the more highly educated,
  affluent elements of the population to suburban areas and the spatial and political
  polarization of whites and nonwhites.In the central sections of U.S. cities, there
  is little sense of history or continuity; instead, one finds evidence of the dominance
  of the engineering mentality and of the credo that the business of the city is business.
  Commercial and administrative activities are paramount, and usually there is little
  room for church buildings or for parks or other nonprofit enterprises. The role
  of the cathedral, so central in the medieval European city, is filled by a U.S.
  invention serving both utilitarian and symbolic purposes, the skyscraper. Some cities
  have felt the need for other bold secular monuments; hence the Gateway Arch looming
  over St. Louis, Seattle’s Space Needle, and Houston’s Astrodome. Future archaeologists
  may well conclude from their excavations that American society was ruled by an oligarchy
  of highway engineers, architects, and bulldozer operators. The great expressways
  converging upon, or looping, the downtown area and the huge amount of space devoted
  to parking lots and garages are even more impressive than the massive surgery executed
  upon U.S. cities a century ago to hack out room for railroad terminals and marshaling
  yards.Within many urban sites there has been radical physical transformation of
  shoreline, drainage systems, and land surface that would be difficult to match elsewhere
  in the world. Thus, in their physical lineaments, Manhattan and inner Boston bear
  scant resemblance to the landscapes seen by their initial settlers. The surface
  of downtown Chicago has been raised several feet above its former swamp level, the
  city’s lakefront extensively reshaped, and the flow of the Chicago River reversed.
  Los Angeles, notorious for its disregard of the environment, has its concrete arroyo
  bottoms, terraced hillsides and landslides, and its own artificial microclimate.The
  supercitiesThe unprecedented outward sprawl of American urban settlement has created
  some novel settlement forms, for the quantitative change has been so great as to
  induce qualitative transformation. The conurbation—a territorial coalescence of
  two or more sizable cities whose peripheral zones have grown together—may have first
  appeared in early 19th-century Europe. There are major examples in Great Britain,
  the Low Countries, and Germany, as well as in Japan.Nothing elsewhere, however,
  rivals in size and complexity the aptly named megalopolis, that supercity stretching
  along the Atlantic from Portland, Maine, past Richmond, Va. Other large conurbations
  include, in the Great Lakes region, one centred on Chicago and containing large
  slices of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Indiana; another based in Detroit, embracing
  large parts of Michigan and Ohio and reaching into Canada; and a third stretching
  from Buffalo through Cleveland and back to Pittsburgh. All three are reaching toward
  one another and may form another megalopolis that, in turn, may soon be grafted
  onto the seaboard megalopolis by a corridor through central New York state.Another
  example of a growing megalopolis is the huge southern California conurbation reaching
  from Santa Barbara, through a dominating Los Angeles, to the Mexican border. The
  solid strip of urban territory that lines the eastern shore of Puget Sound is a
  smaller counterpart. Quite exceptional in form is the slender linear multicity occupying
  Florida’s Atlantic coastline, from Jacksonville to Miami, and the loose swarm of
  medium-sized cities clustering along the Southern Piedmont, from south-central Virginia
  to Birmingham, Ala.; also of note are the Texas cities of Dallas–Fort Worth, Houston,
  and San Antonio, which have formed a rapidly growing—though discontinuous—urbanized
  triangle.One of the few predictions that seem safe in so dynamic and innovative
  a land as the United States is that, unless severe and painful controls are placed
  on land use, the shape of the urban environment will be increasingly megalopolitan:
  a small set of great constellations of polycentric urban zones, each complexly interlocked
  socially and physically with its neighbours.Traditional regions of the United StatesThe
  differences among America’s traditional regions, or culture areas, tend to be slight
  and shallow as compared with such areas in most older, more stable countries. The
  muted, often subtle nature of interregional differences can be ascribed to the relative
  newness of American settlement, a perpetually high degree of mobility, a superb
  communications system, and the galloping centralization of economy and government.
  It might even be argued that some of these regions are quaint vestiges of a vanishing
  past, of interest only to antiquarians.Yet, in spite of the nationwide standardization
  in many areas of American thought and behaviour, the lingering effects of the older
  culture areas do remain potent. In the case of the South, for example, the differences
  helped to precipitate the gravest political crisis and bloodiest military conflict
  in the nation’s history. More than a century after the Civil War, the South remains
  a powerful entity in political, economic, and social terms, and its peculiar status
  is recognized in religious, educational, athletic, and literary circles.Even more
  intriguing is the appearance of a series of essentially 20th-century regions. Southern
  California is the largest and perhaps the most distinctive region, and its special
  culture has attracted large numbers of immigrants to the state. Similar trends are
  visible in southern Florida; in Texas, whose mystique has captured the national
  imagination; and to a certain degree in the more ebullient regions of New Mexico
  and Arizona as well. At the metropolitan level, it is difficult to believe that
  such distinctive cities as San Francisco, Las Vegas, Dallas, Tucson, and Seattle
  have become like all other American cities. A detailed examination, however, would
  show significant if sometimes subtle interregional differences in terms of language,
  religion, diet, folklore, folk architecture and handicrafts, political behaviour,
  social etiquette, and a number of other cultural categories.The hierarchy of culture
  areasA multitiered hierarchy of culture areas might be postulated for the United
  States; but the most interesting levels are, first, the nation as a whole and, second,
  the five to 10 large subnational regions, each embracing several states or major
  portions thereof. There is a remarkably close coincidence between the political
  United States and the cultural United States. Crossing into Mexico, the traveler
  passes across a cultural chasm. If the contrasts are less dramatic between the two
  sides of the U.S.-Canadian boundary, they are nonetheless real, especially to the
  Canadian. Erosion of the cultural barrier has been largely limited to the area that
  stretches from northern New York state to Aroostook county, Maine. There, a vigorous
  demographic and cultural immigration by French-Canadians has gone far toward eradicating
  international differences.While the international boundaries act as a cultural container,
  the interstate boundaries are curiously irrelevant. Even when the state had a strong
  autonomous early existence—as happened with Massachusetts, Virginia, or Pennsylvania—subsequent
  economic and political forces have tended to wash away such initial identities.
  Actually, it could be argued that the political divisions of the 48 coterminous
  states are anachronistic in the context of contemporary socioeconomic and cultural
  forces. Partially convincing cases might be built for equating Utah and Texas with
  their respective culture areas because of exceptional historical and physical circumstances,
  or perhaps Oklahoma, given its very late European occupation and its dubious distinction
  as the territory to which exiled Indian tribes of the East were relegated. In most
  instances, however, the states either contain two or more distinctly different culture
  and political areas or fragments thereof or are part of a much larger single culture
  area. Thus sharp North–South dichotomies characterize California, Missouri, Illinois,
  Indiana, Ohio, and Florida, while Tennessee advertises that there are really three
  Tennessees. In Virginia the opposing cultural forces were so strong that actual
  fission took place in 1863 (with the admission to the Union of West Virginia) along
  one of those rare interstate boundaries that approximate a genuine cultural divide.Much
  remains to be learned about the cause and effect relations between economic and
  culture areas in the United States. If the South or New England could at one time
  be correlated with a specific economic system, this is no longer easy to do. Cultural
  systems appear to respond more slowly to agents of change than do economic or urban
  systems. Thus the Manufacturing Belt, a core region for many social and economic
  activities, now spans parts of four traditional culture areas—New England, the Midland,
  the Midwest, and the northern fringes of the South. The great urban sprawl, from
  southern Maine to central Virginia, blithely ignores the cultural slopes that are
  still visible in its more rural tracts.The cultural hearthsThe culture areas of
  the United States are generally European in origin, the result of importing European
  colonists and ways of life and the subsequent adaptation of social groups to new
  habitats. The aboriginal cultures have had relatively little influence on the nation’s
  modern culture. In the Southwestern and the indistinct Oklahoman subregions, the
  Indian element merits consideration only as one of several ingredients making up
  the regional mosaic. With some exceptions, the map of American culture areas in
  the East can be explained in terms of the genesis, development, and expansion of
  the three principal colonial cultural hearths along the Atlantic seaboard. Each
  was basically British in character, but their personalities remain distinct because
  of, first, different sets of social and political conditions during the critical
  period of first effective settlement and, second, local physical and economic circumstances.
  The cultural gradients between them tend to be much steeper and the boundaries more
  distinct than is true for the remainder of the nation.New EnglandUnited States:
  New EnglandEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.New England was the dominant region during
  the century of rapid expansion following the American Revolution and not merely
  in terms of demographic or economic expansion. In social and cultural life—in education,
  politics, theology, literature, science, architecture, and the more advanced forms
  of mechanical and social technology—the area exercised its primacy. New England
  was the leading source of ideas and styles for the nation from about 1780 to 1880;
  it furnishes an impressive example of the capacity of strongly motivated communities
  to rise above the constraints of a harsh environment.During its first two centuries,
  New England had an unusually homogeneous population. With some exceptions, the British
  immigrants shared the same nonconformist religious beliefs, language, social organization,
  and general outlook. A distinctive regional culture took form, most noticeably in
  terms of dialect, town morphology, and folk architecture. The personality of the
  people also took on a regional coloration both in folklore and in actuality; there
  is sound basis for the belief that the traditional New England Yankee is self-reliant,
  thrifty, inventive, and enterprising. The influx of immigrants that began in the
  1830s diluted and altered the New England identity, but much of its early personality
  survived.By virtue of location, wealth, and seniority, the Boston metropolitan area
  has become the cultural economic centre of New England. This sovereignty is shared
  to some degree, however, with two other old centres, the lower Connecticut Valley
  and the Narragansett Bay region of Rhode Island.The early westward demographic and
  ideological expansion of New England was so influential that it is justifiable to
  call New York, northern New Jersey, northern Pennsylvania, and much of the Upper
  Midwest “New England Extended.” Further, the energetic endeavours of New England
  whalers, merchants, and missionaries had a considerable impact on the cultures of
  Hawaii, various other Pacific isles, and several points in the Caribbean. New Englanders
  also were active in the Americanization of early Oregon and Washington, with results
  that are still visible. Later, the overland diffusion of New England natives and
  practices meant a recognizable New England character not only for the Upper Midwest,
  from Ohio to the Dakotas, but also in the Pacific Northwest in general, though to
  a lesser degree.The SouthUnited States: The Upper SouthEncyclopædia Britannica,
  Inc.By far the largest of the three original Anglo-American culture areas, the South
  is also the most idiosyncratic with respect to national norms—or slowest to accept
  them. The South was once so distinct from the non-South in almost every observable
  or quantifiable feature and so fiercely proud of its peculiarities that for some
  years the question of whether it could maintain political and social unity with
  the non-South was in serious doubt. These differences are still observable in almost
  every realm of human activity, including rural economy, dialect, diet, costume,
  folklore, politics, architecture, social customs, and recreation. Only during the
  20th century can an argument be made that it has achieved a decisive convergence
  with the rest of the nation, at least in terms of economic behaviour and material
  culture.A persistent deviation from the national mainstream probably began in the
  first years of settlement. The first settlers of the South were almost purely British,
  not outwardly different from those who flocked to New England or the Midland, but
  almost certainly distinct in terms of motives and social values and more conservative
  in retaining the rurality and the family and social structure of premodern Europe.
  The vast importation of African slaves was also a major factor, as was a degree
  of contact with the Indians that was less pronounced farther north. In addition,
  the unusual pattern of economy (much different from that of northwestern Europe),
  settlement, and social organization, which were in part an adaptation to a starkly
  unfamiliar physical habitat, accentuated the South’s deviation from other culture
  areas.In both origin and spatial structure, the South has been characterized by
  diffuseness. In the search for a single cultural hearth, the most plausible choice
  is the Chesapeake Bay area and the northeastern corner of North Carolina, the earliest
  area of recognizably Southern character. Early components of Southern population
  and culture also arrived from other sources. A narrow coastal strip from North Carolina
  to the Georgia–Florida border and including the Sea Islands is decidedly Southern
  in character, yet it stands apart self-consciously from other parts of the South.
  Though colonized directly from Great Britain, it had also significant connections
  with the West Indies, in which relation the African cultural contribution was strongest
  and purest. Charleston and Savannah, which nurtured their own distinctive civilizations,
  dominated this subregion. Similarly, French Louisiana received elements of culture
  and population—to be stirred into the special Creole mixture—not only, putatively,
  from the Chesapeake Bay hearth area but also indirectly from France, French Nova
  Scotia, the French West Indies, and Africa. In south central Texas, the Germanic
  and Hispanic influx was so heavy that a special subregion can be designated.It would
  seem, then, that the Southern culture area may be an example of convergent, or parallel,
  evolution of a variety of elements arriving along several paths but subject to some
  single general process that could mold one larger regional consciousness and way
  of life.Because of its slowness in joining the national technological mainstream,
  the South can be subdivided into a much greater number of subregions than is possible
  for any of the other older traditional regions. Those described above are of lesser
  order than the two principal Souths, variously called Upper and Lower (or Deep)
  South, Upland and Lowland South, or Yeoman and Plantation South.The Upland South,
  which comprises the southern Appalachians, the upper Appalachian Piedmont, the Cumberland
  and other low interior plateaus, and the Ozarks and Ouachitas, was colonized culturally
  and demographically from the Chesapeake Bay hearth area and the Midland; it is most
  emphatically white Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) in character. The latter area,
  which contains a large black population, includes the greater part of the South
  Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains and the lower Appalachian Piedmont. Its early major
  influences came from the Chesapeake Bay area, with only minor elements from the
  coastal Carolina–Georgia belt, Louisiana, and elsewhere. The division between the
  two subregions remains distinct from Virginia to Texas, but each region can be further
  subdivided. Within the Upland South, the Ozark region might legitimately be detached
  from the Appalachian; and, within the latter, the proud and prosperous Kentucky
  Bluegrass, with its emphasis on tobacco and Thoroughbreds, certainly merits special
  recognition.Toward the margins of the South, the difficulties in delimiting subregions
  become greater. The outer limits themselves are a topic of special interest. There
  seems to be more than an accidental relation between these limits and various climatic
  factors. The fuzzy northern boundary, definitely not associated with the conventional
  Mason and Dixon Line or the Ohio River, seems most closely associated with length
  of frost-free season or with temperature during the winter. As the Southern cultural
  complex was carried to the West, it not only retained its strength but became more
  intense, in contrast to the influence of New England and the Midland. But the South
  finally fades away as one approaches the 100th meridian, with its critical decline
  in annual precipitation. The apparent correlation between the cultural South and
  a humid subtropical climatic regime is in many ways valid.The Texas subregion is
  so large, distinctive, vigorous, and self-assertive that it presents some vexing
  classificatory questions. Is Texas simply a subregion of the Greater South, or has
  it acquired so strong and divergent an identity that it can be regarded as a major
  region in its own right? It is likely that a major region has been born in a frontier
  zone in which several distinct cultural communities confront one another and in
  which the mixture has bred the vigorous, extroverted, aggressive Texas personality
  so widely celebrated in song and story. Similarly, peninsular Florida may be considered
  either within or juxtaposed to the South but not necessarily part of it. In the
  case of Florida, an almost empty territory began to receive significant settlement
  only after about 1890, and if, like Texas, most of it came from the older South,
  there were also vigorous infusions from elsewhere.The MidlandUnited States: Middle
  Atlantic regionEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The significance of this region has
  not been less than that of New England or the South, but its characteristics are
  the least conspicuous to outsiders as well as to its own residents—reflecting, perhaps,
  its centrality in the course of U.S. development. The Midland (a term not to be
  confused with Midwest) comprises portions of Middle Atlantic and Upper Southern
  states: Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland. Serious European settlement
  of the Midland began a generation or more after that of the other major cultural
  centres and after several earlier, relatively ineffectual trials by the Dutch, Swedes,
  Finns, and British. But once begun late in the 17th century by William Penn and
  his associates, the colonization of the area was a success. Within southeastern
  Pennsylvania this culture area first assumed its distinctive character: a prosperous,
  sober, industrious agricultural society that quickly became a mixed economy as mercantile
  and later industrial functions came to the fore. By the mid-18th century much of
  the region had acquired a markedly urban character, resembling in many ways the
  more advanced portions of the North Sea countries. In this respect, at least, the
  Midland was well ahead of neighbouring areas to the north and south.It differed
  also in its polyglot ethnicity. From almost the beginning, the various ethnic and
  religious groups of the British Isles were joined by immigrants from the European
  mainland. This diversity has grown and is likely to continue. The mosaic of colonial
  ethnic groups has persisted in much of Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and Maryland,
  as has the remarkable variety of nationalities and churches in coalfields, company
  towns, cities, and many rural areas. Much of the same ethnic heterogeneity can be
  seen in New England, the Midwest, and a few other areas, but the Midland stands
  out as perhaps the most polyglot region of the nation. The Germanic element has
  always been notably strong, if irregularly distributed, in the Midland, accounting
  for more than 70 percent of the population of many towns. Had the Anglo-American
  culture not triumphed, the area might well have been designated Pennsylvania German.Physiography
  and migration carried the Midland culture area into the Maryland Piedmont. Although
  its width tapers quickly below the Potomac, it reaches into parts of Virginia and
  West Virginia, with traces legible far down the Appalachian zone and into the South.The
  northern half of the greater Midland region (the New York subregion, or New England
  Extended) cannot be assigned unequivocally to either New England or this Midland.
  Essentially it is a hybrid formed mainly from two regional strains of almost equal
  strength: New England and the post-1660 British element moving up the Hudson valley
  and beyond. There has also been a persistent, if slight, residue of early Dutch
  culture and some subtle filtering northward of Pennsylvanian influences. Apparently
  within the New York subregion occurred the first major fusion of American regional
  cultures, especially within the early 19th-century “Burned-Over District,” around
  the Finger Lakes and Genesee areas of central and western New York. This locality,
  the seedbed for a number of important social innovations, was a major staging area
  for westward migration and possibly a major source for the people and notions that
  were to build the Midwestern culture area.Toward the west the Midland retains its
  integrity for only a short distance—certainly no further than eastern Ohio—as it
  becomes submerged within the Midwest. Still, its significance in the genesis of
  the Midwest and the national culture should not be minimized. Its success in projecting
  its image upon so much of the country may have drawn attention away from the source
  area. As both name and location suggest, the Midland is intermediate in character
  in many respects, lying between New England and the South. Its residents are much
  less concerned with, or conscious of, a strong regional identity (excepting the
  Pennsylvania Dutch caricatures) than is true for the other regions, and, in addition,
  the Midland lacks their strong political and literary traditions, though it is unmistakable
  in its distinctive townscapes and farmsteads.The newer culture areasThe MidwestUnited
  States: The MidwestEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc. There is no such self-effacement
  in the Midwest, that large triangular region justly regarded as the most nearly
  representative of the national average. Everyone within or outside of the Midwest
  knows of its existence, but no one is certain where it begins or ends. The older
  apex of the eastward-pointing triangle appears to rest around Pittsburgh, while
  the two western corners melt away somewhere in the Great Plains, possibly in southern
  Manitoba in the north and southern Kansas in the south. The eastern terminus and
  the southern and western borders are broad, indistinct transitional zones.Serious
  study of the historical geography of the Midwest began only in the 20th century,
  but it seems likely that this culture region was the combination of all three colonial
  regions and that this combination first took place in the upper Ohio valley. The
  early routes of travel—the Ohio and its tributaries, the Great Lakes, and the low,
  level corridor along the Mohawk and the coastal plains of Lake Ontario and Lake
  Erie—converge upon Ohio. There, the people and cultural traits from New England,
  the Midland, and the South were first funneled together. There seems to have been
  a fanlike widening of the new hybrid area into the West as settlers worked their
  way frontierward.Two major subregions are readily discerned, the Upper and Lower
  Midwest. They are separated by a line, roughly approximating the 41st parallel,
  that persists as far west as Colorado in terms of speech patterns and indicates
  differences in regional provenance in ethnic and religious terms as well. Much of
  the Upper Midwest retains a faint New England character, although Midland influences
  are probably as important. A rich mixture of German, Scandinavian, Slavic, and other
  non-WASP elements has greatly diversified a stock in which the British element usually
  remains dominant and the range of church denominations is great. The Lower Midwest,
  except for the relative scarcity of blacks, tends to resemble the South in its predominantly
  Protestant and British makeup. There are some areas with sizable Roman Catholic
  and non-WASP populations, but on the whole the subregion tends to be more WASP in
  inclination than most other parts of the nation.The problem of “the West”Mountain
  Region: History and PeopleEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The foregoing culture areas
  account for roughly the eastern half of the coterminous United States. There is
  a dilemma in classifying the remaining half. The concept of the American West, strong
  in the popular imagination, is reinforced constantly by romanticized cinematic and
  television images of the cowboy. It is facile to accept the widespread Western livestock
  complex as epitomizing the full gamut of Western life, because although the cattle
  industry may have once accounted for more than one-half of the active Western domain
  as measured in acres, it employed only a relatively small fraction of the total
  population. As a single subculture, it cannot represent the total regional culture.It
  is not clear whether there is a genuine, single, grand Western culture region. Unlike
  the East, where virtually all the land is developed and culture areas and subregions
  abut and overlap in splendid confusion, the eight major and many lesser nodes of
  population in the western United States resemble oases, separated from one another
  by wide expanses of nearly unpopulated mountain or arid desert. The only obvious
  properties these isolated clusters have in common are, first, the intermixture of
  several strains of culture, primarily from the East but with additions from Europe,
  Mexico, and East Asia, and, second, except for one subregion, a general modernity,
  having been settled in a serious way no earlier than the 1840s. Some areas may be
  viewed as inchoate, or partially formed, cultural entities; the others have acquired
  definite personalities but are difficult to classify as first-order or lesser order
  culture areas.There are several major tracts in the western United States that reveal
  a genuine cultural identity: the Upper Rio Grande region, the Mormon region, southern
  California, and, by some accounts, northern California. To this group one might
  add the anomalous Texan and Oklahoman subregions, which have elements of both the
  West and the South.United States: The SouthwestEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The
  term Upper Rio Grande region was coined to denote the oldest and strongest of the
  three sectors of Hispanic-American activity in the Southwest, the others being southern
  California and portions of Texas. Although covering the valley of the upper Rio
  Grande, the region also embraces segments of Arizona and Colorado as well as other
  parts of New Mexico. European communities and culture have been present there, with
  only one interruption, since the late 16th century. The initial sources were Spain
  and Mexico, but after 1848 at least three distinct strains of Anglo-American culture
  were increasingly well represented—the Southern, Mormon, and a general undifferentiated
  Northeastern culture—plus a distinct Texan subcategory. For once this has occurred
  without obliterating the Indians, whose culture endures in various stages of dilution,
  from the strongly Americanized or Hispanicized to the almost undisturbed.The general
  mosaic is a fabric of Indian, Anglo, and Hispanic elements, and all three major
  groups, furthermore, are complex in character. The Indian component is made up of
  Navajo, Pueblo, and several smaller groups, each of which is quite distinct from
  the others. The Hispanic element is also diverse—modally Mexican mestizo, but ranging
  from pure Spanish to nearly pure pre-Spanish aboriginal.United States: The northern
  Mountain regionEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The Mormon region is expansive in the
  religious and demographic realms, though it has ceased to expand territorially as
  it did in the decades after the first settlement in the Salt Lake valley in 1847.
  Despite its Great Basin location and an exemplary adaptation to environmental constraints,
  this cultural complex appears somewhat non-Western in spirit: the Mormons may be
  in the West, but they are not entirely of it. Their historical derivation from the
  Midwest and from ultimate sources in New York and New England is still apparent,
  along with the generous admixture of European converts to their religion.As in New
  England, the power of the human will and an intensely cherished abstract design
  have triumphed over an unfriendly habitat. The Mormon way of life is expressed in
  the settlement landscape and economic activities within a region more homogeneous
  internally than any other U.S. culture area.CaliforniaEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.In
  contrast, northern California has yet to gain its own strong cultural coloration.
  From the beginning of the great 1849 gold rush the area drew a diverse population
  from Europe and Asia as well as the older portions of the United States. Whether
  the greater part of northern California has produced a culture amounting to more
  than the sum of the contributions brought by immigrants is questionable. San Francisco,
  the regional metropolis, may have crossed the qualitative threshold. An unusually
  cosmopolitan outlook that includes an awareness of the Orient stronger than that
  of any other U.S. city, a fierce self-esteem, and a unique townscape may be symptomatic
  of a genuinely new, emergent local culture.Southern California is the most spectacular
  of the Western regions, not only in terms of economic and population growth but
  also for the luxuriance, regional particularism, and general avant-garde character
  of its swiftly evolving cultural pattern. Until the coming of a direct transcontinental
  rail connection in 1885, the region was remote, rural, and largely inconsequential.
  Since then, the invasion by persons from virtually every corner of North America
  and by the world has been massive, but since the 1960s in-migration has slackened
  perceptibly, and many residents have begun to question the doctrine of unlimited
  growth. In any event, a loosely articulated series of urban and suburban developments
  continue to encroach upon what little is left of arable or habitable land in the
  Coast Ranges and valleys from Santa Barbara to the Mexican border.Although every
  major ethnic and racial group and every other U.S. culture area is amply represented
  in southern California, there is reason to suspect that a process of selection for
  certain types of people, attitudes, and personality traits may have been at work
  at both source and destination. The region is distinct from, or perhaps in the vanguard
  of, the remainder of the nation. One might view southern California as the super-American
  region or the outpost of a postindustrial future, but its cultural distinctiveness
  is very evident in landscape and social behaviour. Southern California in no way
  approaches being a “traditional region,” or even the smudged facsimile of such,
  but rather the largest, boldest experiment in creating a “voluntary region,” one
  built through the self-selection of immigrants and their subsequent interaction.United
  States: The northern Pacific CoastEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The remaining identifiable
  Western regions—the Willamette valley of Oregon, the Puget Sound region, the Inland
  Empire of eastern Washington and adjacent tracts of Idaho and Oregon, central Arizona,
  and the Colorado Piedmont—can be treated jointly as potential, or emergent, culture
  areas, still too close to the national mean to display any cultural distinctiveness.
  In all of these regions is evident the arrival of a cross section of the national
  population and the growth of regional life around one or more major metropolises.
  A New England element is noteworthy in the Willamette valley and Puget Sound regions,
  while a Hispanic-American component appears in the Colorado Piedmont and central
  Arizona. Only time and further study will reveal whether any of these regions, so
  distant from the historic sources of U.S. population and culture, have the capacity
  to become an independent cultural area.Wilbur Zelinsky\r\n                \n\n        \n

  of America, abbreviations U.S. or U.S.A., byname America, \n    country of North
  America, a federal republic of 50 states. Besides the 48 contiguous states that
  occupy the middle latitudes of the continent, the United States includes the state
  of Alaska, at the northwestern extreme of North America, and the island state of
  Hawaii, in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The coterminous states are bounded on the north
  by Canada, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the Gulf of Mexico
  and Mexico, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. The United States is the fourth
  largest country in the world in area (after Russia, Canada, and China). The national
  capital is Washington, which is coextensive with the District of Columbia, the federal
  capital region created in 1790.The major characteristic of the United States is
  probably its great variety. Its physical environment ranges from the Arctic to the
  subtropical, from the moist rain forest to the arid desert, from the rugged mountain
  peak to the flat prairie. Although the total population of the United States is
  large by world standards, its overall population density is relatively low; the
  country embraces some of the world’s largest urban concentrations as well as some
  of the most extensive areas that are almost devoid of habitation.The United States
  contains a highly diverse population. Unlike a country such as China that largely
  incorporated indigenous peoples, the United States has a diversity that to a great
  degree has come from an immense and sustained global immigration. Probably no other
  country has a wider range of racial, ethnic, and cultural types than does the United
  States. In addition to the presence of surviving Native Americans (including American
  Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos) and the descendants of Africans taken as slaves to
  the New World, the national character has been enriched, tested, and constantly
  redefined by the tens of millions of immigrants who by and large have come to America
  hoping for greater social, political, and economic opportunities than they had in
  the places they left. (It should be noted that although the terms “America” and
  “Americans” are often used as synonyms for the United States and its citizens, respectively,
  they are also used in a broader sense for North, South, and Central America collectively
  and their citizens.)The United States is the world’s greatest economic power, measured
  in terms of gross national product (GNP). The nation’s wealth is partly a reflection
  of its rich natural resources and its enormous agricultural output, but it owes
  more to the country’s highly developed industry. Despite its relative economic self-sufficiency
  in many areas, the United States is the most important single factor in world trade
  by virtue of the sheer size of its economy. Its exports and imports represent major
  proportions of the world total. The United States also impinges on the global economy
  as a source of and as a destination for investment capital. The country continues
  to sustain an economic life that is more diversified than any other on Earth, providing
  the majority of its people with one of the world’s highest standards of living.The
  United States is relatively young by world standards, being barely more than 200
  years old; it achieved its current size only in the mid-20th century. America was
  the first of the European colonies to separate successfully from its motherland,
  and it was the first nation to be established on the premise that sovereignty rests
  with its citizens and not with the government. In its first century and a half,
  the country was mainly preoccupied with its own territorial expansion and economic
  growth and with social debates that ultimately led to civil war and a healing period
  that is still not complete. In the 20th century the United States emerged as a world
  power, and since World War II it has been one of the preeminent powers. It has not
  accepted this mantle easily nor always carried it willingly; the principles and
  ideals of its founders have been tested by the pressures and exigencies of its dominant
  status. Although the United States still offers its residents opportunities for
  unparalleled personal advancement and wealth, the depletion of its resources, contamination
  of its environment, and continuing social and economic inequality that perpetuates
  areas of poverty and blight all threaten the fabric of the country.The District
  of Columbia is discussed in the article Washington. For discussion of other major
  U.S. cities, see the articles Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York
  City, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. Political units in association with the United
  States include Puerto Rico, discussed in the article Puerto Rico, and several Pacific
  islands, discussed in Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa.The two
  great sets of elements that mold the physical environment of the United States are,
  first, the geologic, which determines the main patterns of landforms, drainage,
  and mineral resources and influences soils to a lesser degree, and, second, the
  atmospheric, which dictates not only climate and weather but also in large part
  the distribution of soils, plants, and animals. Although these elements are not
  entirely independent of one another, each produces on a map patterns that are so
  profoundly different that essentially they remain two separate geographies. (Since
  this article covers only the coterminous United States, see also the articles Alaska
  and Hawaii.)The centre of the coterminous United States is a great sprawling interior
  lowland, reaching from the ancient shield of central Canada on the north to the
  Gulf of Mexico on the south. To east and west this lowland rises, first gradually
  and then abruptly, to mountain ranges that divide it from the sea on both sides.
  The two mountain systems differ drastically. The Appalachian Mountains on the east
  are low, almost unbroken, and in the main set well back from the Atlantic. From
  New York to the Mexican border stretches the low Coastal Plain, which faces the
  ocean along a swampy, convoluted coast. The gently sloping surface of the plain
  extends out beneath the sea, where it forms the continental shelf, which, although
  submerged beneath shallow ocean water, is geologically identical to the Coastal
  Plain. Southward the plain grows wider, swinging westward in Georgia and Alabama
  to truncate the Appalachians along their southern extremity and separate the interior
  lowland from the Gulf.West of the Central Lowland is the mighty Cordillera, part
  of a global mountain system that rings the Pacific Basin. The Cordillera encompasses
  fully one-third of the United States, with an internal variety commensurate with
  its size. At its eastern margin lie the Rocky Mountains, a high, diverse, and discontinuous
  chain that stretches all the way from New Mexico to the Canadian border. The Cordillera’s
  western edge is a Pacific coastal chain of rugged mountains and inland valleys,
  the whole rising spectacularly from the sea without benefit of a coastal plain.
  Pent between the Rockies and the Pacific chain is a vast intermontane complex of
  basins, plateaus, and isolated ranges so large and remarkable that they merit recognition
  as a region separate from the Cordillera itself.These regions—the Interior Lowlands
  and their upland fringes, the Appalachian Mountain system, the Atlantic Plain, the
  Western Cordillera, and the Western Intermontane Region—are so various that they
  require further division into 24 major subregions, or provinces (see map).Midwest
  States: GeographyEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Andrew Jackson is supposed to have
  remarked that the United States begins at the Alleghenies, implying that only west
  of the mountains, in the isolation and freedom of the great Interior Lowlands, could
  people finally escape Old World influences. Whether or not the lowlands constitute
  the country’s cultural core is debatable, but there can be no doubt that they comprise
  its geologic core and in many ways its geographic core as well.This enormous region
  rests upon an ancient, much-eroded platform of complex crystalline rocks that have
  for the most part lain undisturbed by major orogenic (mountain-building) activity
  for more than 600,000,000 years. Over much of central Canada, these Precambrian
  rocks are exposed at the surface and form the continent’s single largest topographical
  region, the formidable and ice-scoured Canadian Shield.In the United States most
  of the crystalline platform is concealed under a deep blanket of sedimentary rocks.
  In the far north, however, the naked Canadian Shield extends into the United States
  far enough to form two small but distinctive landform regions: the rugged and occasionally
  spectacular Adirondack Mountains of northern New York; and the more subdued but
  austere Superior Uplands of northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. As in the
  rest of the shield, glaciers have stripped soils away, strewn the surface with boulders
  and other debris, and obliterated preglacial drainage systems. Most attempts at
  farming in these areas have been abandoned, but the combination of a comparative
  wilderness in a northern climate, clear lakes, and white-water streams has fostered
  the development of both regions as year-round outdoor recreation areas.Mineral wealth
  in the Superior Uplands is legendary. Iron lies near the surface and close to the
  deepwater ports of the upper Great Lakes. Iron is mined both north and south of
  Lake Superior, but best known are the colossal deposits of Minnesota’s Mesabi Range,
  for more than a century one of the world’s richest and a vital element in America’s
  rise to industrial power. In spite of depletion, the Minnesota and Michigan mines
  still yield a major proportion of the country’s iron and a significant percentage
  of the world’s supply.South of the Adirondack Mountains and Superior Uplands lies
  the boundary between crystalline and sedimentary rocks; abruptly, everything is
  different. The core of this sedimentary region—the heartland of the United States—is
  the great Central Lowland, which stretches for 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometres) from
  New York to central Texas and north another 1,000 miles to the Canadian province
  of Saskatchewan. To some, the landscape may seem dull, for heights of more than
  2,000 feet (600 metres) are unusual, and truly rough terrain is almost lacking.
  Landscapes are varied, however, largely as the result of glaciation that directly
  or indirectly affected most of the subregion. North of the Missouri–Ohio river line,
  the advance and readvance of continental ice left an intricate mosaic of boulders,
  sand, gravel, silt, and clay and a complex pattern of lakes and drainage channels,
  some abandoned, some still in use. The southern part of the Central Lowland is quite
  different, covered mostly with loess (wind-deposited silt) that further subdued
  the already low relief surface. Elsewhere, especially near major rivers, postglacial
  streams carved the loess into rounded hills, and visitors have aptly compared their
  billowing shapes to the waves of the sea. Above all, the loess produces soil of
  extraordinary fertility. As the Mesabi iron was a major source of America’s industrial
  wealth, its agricultural prosperity has been rooted in Midwestern loess.The Central
  Lowland resembles a vast saucer, rising gradually to higher lands on all sides.
  Southward and eastward, the land rises gradually to three major plateaus. Beyond
  the reach of glaciation to the south, the sedimentary rocks have been raised into
  two broad upwarps, separated from one another by the great valley of the Mississippi
  River. The Ozark Plateau lies west of the river and occupies most of southern Missouri
  and northern Arkansas; on the east the Interior Low Plateaus dominate central Kentucky
  and Tennessee. Except for two nearly circular patches of rich limestone country—the
  Nashville Basin of Tennessee and the Kentucky Bluegrass region—most of both plateau
  regions consists of sandstone uplands, intricately dissected by streams. Local relief
  runs to several hundreds of feet in most places, and visitors to the region must
  travel winding roads along narrow stream valleys. The soils there are poor, and
  mineral resources are scanty.Eastward from the Central Lowland the Appalachian Plateau—a
  narrow band of dissected uplands that strongly resembles the Ozark Plateau and Interior
  Low Plateaus in steep slopes, wretched soils, and endemic poverty—forms a transition
  between the interior plains and the Appalachian Mountains. Usually, however, the
  Appalachian Plateau is considered a subregion of the Appalachian Mountains, partly
  on grounds of location, partly because of geologic structure. Unlike the other plateaus,
  where rocks are warped upward, the rocks there form an elongated basin, wherein
  bituminous coal has been preserved from erosion. This Appalachian coal, like the
  Mesabi iron that it complements in U.S. industry, is extraordinary. Extensive, thick,
  and close to the surface, it has stoked the furnaces of northeastern steel mills
  for decades and helps explain the huge concentration of heavy industry along the
  lower Great Lakes.The western flanks of the Interior Lowlands are the Great Plains,
  a territory of awesome bulk that spans the full distance between Canada and Mexico
  in a swath nearly 500 miles wide. The Great Plains were built by successive layers
  of poorly cemented sand, silt, and gravel—debris laid down by parallel east-flowing
  streams from the Rocky Mountains. Seen from the east, the surface of the Great Plains
  rises inexorably from about 2,000 feet near Omaha, Neb., to more than 6,000 feet
  at Cheyenne, Wyo., but the climb is so gradual that popular legend holds the Great
  Plains to be flat. True flatness is rare, although the High Plains of western Texas,
  Oklahoma, Kansas, and eastern Colorado come close. More commonly, the land is broadly
  rolling, and parts of the northern plains are sharply dissected into badlands.The
  main mineral wealth of the Interior Lowlands derives from fossil fuels. Coal occurs
  in structural basins protected from erosion—high-quality bituminous in the Appalachian,
  Illinois, and western Kentucky basins; and subbituminous and lignite in the eastern
  and northwestern Great Plains. Petroleum and natural gas have been found in nearly
  every state between the Appalachians and the Rockies, but the Midcontinent Fields
  of western Texas and the Texas Panhandle, Oklahoma, and Kansas surpass all others.
  Aside from small deposits of lead and zinc, metallic minerals are of little importance.Screw
  Auger Falls© George WuerthnerThe Appalachians dominate the eastern United States
  and separate the Eastern Seaboard from the interior with a belt of subdued uplands
  that extends nearly 1,500 miles from northeastern Alabama to the Canadian border.
  They are old, complex mountains, the eroded stumps of much greater ranges. Present
  topography results from erosion that has carved weak rocks away, leaving a skeleton
  of resistant rocks behind as highlands. Geologic differences are thus faithfully
  reflected in topography. In the Appalachians these differences are sharply demarcated
  and neatly arranged, so that all the major subdivisions except New England lie in
  strips parallel to the Atlantic and to one another.The core of the Appalachians
  is a belt of complex metamorphic and igneous rocks that stretches all the way from
  Alabama to New Hampshire. The western side of this belt forms the long slender rampart
  of the Blue Ridge Mountains, containing the highest elevations in the Appalachians
  (Mount Mitchell, N.C., 6,684 feet [2,037 metres]) and some of its most handsome
  mountain scenery. On its eastern, or seaward, side the Blue Ridge descends in an
  abrupt and sometimes spectacular escarpment to the Piedmont, a well-drained, rolling
  land—never quite hills, but never quite a plain. Before the settlement of the Midwest
  the Piedmont was the most productive agricultural region in the United States, and
  several Pennsylvania counties still consistently report some of the highest farm
  yields per acre in the entire country.West of the crystalline zone, away from the
  axis of primary geologic deformation, sedimentary rocks have escaped metamorphism
  but are compressed into tight folds. Erosion has carved the upturned edges of these
  folded rocks into the remarkable Ridge and Valley country of the western Appalachians.
  Long linear ridges characteristically stand about 1,000 feet from base to crest
  and run for tens of miles, paralleled by broad open valleys of comparable length.
  In Pennsylvania, ridges run unbroken for great distances, occasionally turning abruptly
  in a zigzag pattern; by contrast, the southern ridges are broken by faults and form
  short, parallel segments that are lined up like magnetized iron filings. By far
  the largest valley—and one of the most important routes in North America—is the
  Great Valley, an extraordinary trench of shale and limestone that runs nearly the
  entire length of the Appalachians. It provides a lowland passage from the middle
  Hudson valley to Harrisburg, Pa., and on southward, where it forms the Shenandoah
  and Cumberland valleys, and has been one of the main paths through the Appalachians
  since pioneer times. In New England it is floored with slates and marbles and forms
  the Valley of Vermont, one of the few fertile areas in an otherwise mountainous
  region.Topography much like that of the Ridge and Valley is found in the Ouachita
  Mountains of western Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma, an area generally thought to
  be a detached continuation of Appalachian geologic structure, the intervening section
  buried beneath the sediments of the lower Mississippi valley.The once-glaciated
  New England section of the Appalachians is divided from the rest of the chain by
  an indentation of the Atlantic. Although almost completely underlain by crystalline
  rocks, New England is laid out in north–south bands, reminiscent of the southern
  Appalachians. The rolling, rocky hills of southeastern New England are not dissimilar
  to the Piedmont, while, farther northwest, the rugged and lofty White Mountains
  are a New England analogue to the Blue Ridge. (Mount Washington, N.H., at 6,288
  feet [1917 metres], is the highest peak in the northeastern United States.) The
  westernmost ranges—the Taconics, Berkshires, and Green Mountains—show a strong north–south
  lineation like the Ridge and Valley. Unlike the rest of the Appalachians, however,
  glaciation has scoured the crystalline rocks much like those of the Canadian Shield,
  so that New England is best known for its picturesque landscape, not for its fertile
  soil.Typical of diverse geologic regions, the Appalachians contain a great variety
  of minerals. Only a few occur in quantities large enough for sustained exploitation,
  notably iron in Pennsylvania’s Blue Ridge and Piedmont and the famous granites,
  marbles, and slates of northern New England. In Pennsylvania the Ridge and Valley
  region contains one of the world’s largest deposits of anthracite coal, once the
  basis of a thriving mining economy; many of the mines are now shut, oil and gas
  having replaced coal as the major fuel used to heat homes.Northeast USA: Physical
  LandscapeEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The eastern and southeastern fringes of the
  United States are part of the outermost margins of the continental platform, repeatedly
  invaded by the sea and veneered with layer after layer of young, poorly consolidated
  sediments. Part of this platform now lies slightly above sea level and forms a nearly
  flat and often swampy coastal plain, which stretches from Cape Cod, Mass., to beyond
  the Mexican border. Most of the platform, however, is still submerged, so that a
  band of shallow water, the continental shelf, parallels the Atlantic and Gulf coasts,
  in some places reaching 250 miles out to sea.The Atlantic Plain slopes so gently
  that even slight crustal upwarping can shift the coastline far out to sea at the
  expense of the continental shelf. The peninsula of Florida is just such an upwarp;
  nowhere in its 400-mile length does the land rise more than 350 feet above sea level;
  much of the southern and coastal areas rise less than 10 feet and are poorly drained
  and dangerously exposed to Atlantic storms. Downwarps can result in extensive flooding.
  North of New York City, for example, the weight of glacial ice depressed most of
  the Coastal Plain beneath the sea, and the Atlantic now beats directly against New
  England’s rock-ribbed coasts. Cape Cod, Long Island (N.Y.), and a few offshore islands
  are all that remain of New England’s drowned Coastal Plain. Another downwarp lies
  perpendicular to the Gulf coast and guides the course of the lower Mississippi.
  The river, however, has filled with alluvium what otherwise would be an arm of the
  Gulf, forming a great inland salient of the Coastal Plain called the Mississippi
  Embayment.The Southeast: GeographyEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.South of New York
  the Coastal Plain gradually widens, but ocean water has invaded the lower valleys
  of most of the coastal rivers and has turned them into estuaries. The greatest of
  these is Chesapeake Bay, merely the flooded lower valley of the Susquehanna River
  and its tributaries, but there are hundreds of others. Offshore a line of sandbars
  and barrier beaches stretches intermittently the length of the Coastal Plain, hampering
  entry of shipping into the estuaries but providing the eastern United States with
  a playground that is more than 1,000 miles long.Poor soils are the rule on the Coastal
  Plain, though rare exceptions have formed some of America’s most famous agricultural
  regions—for example, the citrus country of central Florida’s limestone uplands and
  the Cotton Belt of the Old South, once centred on the alluvial plain of the Mississippi
  and belts of chalky black soils of eastern Texas, Alabama, and Mississippi. The
  Atlantic Plain’s greatest natural wealth derives from petroleum and natural gas
  trapped in domal structures that dot the Gulf Coast of eastern Texas and Louisiana.
  Onshore and offshore drilling have revealed colossal reserves of oil and natural
  gas.Mountain Region: GeographyEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.West of the Great Plains
  the United States seems to become a craggy land whose skyline is rarely without
  mountains—totally different from the open plains and rounded hills of the East.
  On a map the alignment of the two main chains—the Rocky Mountains on the east, the
  Pacific ranges on the west—tempts one to assume a geologic and hence topographic
  homogeneity. Nothing could be farther from the truth, for each chain is divided
  into widely disparate sections.The Rockies are typically diverse. The Southern Rockies
  are composed of a disconnected series of lofty elongated upwarps, their cores made
  of granitic basement rocks, stripped of sediments, and heavily glaciated at high
  elevations. In New Mexico and along the western flanks of the Colorado ranges, widespread
  volcanism and deformation of colourful sedimentary rocks have produced rugged and
  picturesque country, but the characteristic central Colorado or southern Wyoming
  range is impressively austere rather than spectacular. The Front Range west of Denver
  is prototypical, rising abruptly from its base at about 6,000 feet to rolling alpine
  meadows between 11,000 and 12,000 feet. Peaks appear as low hills perched on this
  high-level surface, so that Colorado, for example, boasts 53 mountains over 14,000
  feet but not one over 14,500 feet.The Middle Rockies cover most of west central
  Wyoming. Most of the ranges resemble the granitic upwarps of Colorado, but thrust
  faulting and volcanism have produced varied and spectacular country to the west,
  some of which is included in Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks. Much of
  the subregion, however, is not mountainous at all but consists of extensive intermontane
  basins and plains—largely floored with enormous volumes of sedimentary waste eroded
  from the mountains themselves. Whole ranges have been buried, producing the greatest
  gap in the Cordilleran system, the Wyoming Basin—resembling in geologic structure
  and topography an intermontane peninsula of the Great Plains. As a result, the Rockies
  have never posed an important barrier to east–west transportation in the United
  States; all major routes, from the Oregon Trail to interstate highways, funnel through
  the basin, essentially circumventing the main ranges of the Rockies.The Northern
  Rockies contain the most varied mountain landscapes of the Cordillera, reflecting
  a corresponding geologic complexity. The region’s backbone is a mighty series of
  batholiths—huge masses of molten rock that slowly cooled below the surface and were
  later uplifted. The batholiths are eroded into rugged granitic ranges, which, in
  central Idaho, compose the most extensive wilderness country in the coterminous
  United States. East of the batholiths and opposite the Great Plains, sediments have
  been folded and thrust-faulted into a series of linear north–south ranges, a southern
  extension of the spectacular Canadian Rockies. Although elevations run 2,000 to
  3,000 feet lower than the Colorado Rockies (most of the Idaho Rockies lie well below
  10,000 feet), increased rainfall and northern latitude have encouraged glaciation—there
  as elsewhere a sculptor of handsome alpine landscape.The Pacific Region: OverviewEncyclopædia
  Britannica, Inc.The western branch of the Cordillera directly abuts the Pacific
  Ocean. This coastal chain, like its Rocky Mountain cousins on the eastern flank
  of the Cordillera, conceals bewildering complexity behind a facade of apparent simplicity.
  At first glance the chain consists merely of two lines of mountains with a discontinuous
  trough between them. Immediately behind the coast is a line of hills and low mountains—the
  Pacific Coast Ranges. Farther inland, averaging 150 miles from the coast, the line
  of the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range includes the highest elevations in the
  coterminous United States. Between these two unequal mountain lines is a discontinuous
  trench, the Troughs of the Coastal Margin.Kings Canyon National ParkJosef MuenchThe
  apparent simplicity disappears under the most cursory examination. The Pacific Coast
  Ranges actually contain five distinct sections, each of different geologic origin
  and each with its own distinctive topography. The Transverse Ranges of southern
  California are a crowded assemblage of islandlike faulted ranges, with peak elevations
  of more than 10,000 feet but sufficiently separated by plains and low passes so
  that travel through them is easy. From Point Conception to the Oregon border, however,
  the main California Coast Ranges are entirely different, resembling the Appalachian
  Ridge and Valley region, with low linear ranges that result from erosion of faulted
  and folded rocks. Major faults run parallel to the low ridges, and the greatest—the
  notorious San Andreas Fault—was responsible for the earthquake that all but destroyed
  San Francisco in 1906. Along the California–Oregon border, everything changes again.
  In this region, the wildly rugged Klamath Mountains represent a western salient
  of interior structure reminiscent of the Idaho Rockies and the northern Sierra Nevada.
  In western Oregon and southwestern Washington the Coast Ranges are also different—a
  gentle, hilly land carved by streams from a broad arch of marine deposits interbedded
  with tabular lavas. In the northernmost part of the Coast Ranges and the remote
  northwest, a domal upwarp has produced the Olympic Mountains; its serrated peaks
  tower nearly 8,000 feet above Puget Sound and the Pacific, and the heavy precipitation
  on its upper slopes supports the largest active glaciers in the United States outside
  of Alaska.East of these Pacific Coast Ranges the Troughs of the Coastal Margin contain
  the only extensive lowland plains of the Pacific margin—California’s Central Valley,
  Oregon’s Willamette River valley, and the half-drowned basin of Puget Sound in Washington.
  Parts of an inland trench that extends for great distances along the east coast
  of the Pacific, similar valleys occur in such diverse areas as Chile and the Alaska
  panhandle. These valleys are blessed with superior soils, easily irrigated, and
  very accessible from the Pacific. They have enticed settlers for more than a century
  and have become the main centres of population and economic activity for much of
  the U.S. West Coast.Still farther east rise the two highest mountain chains in the
  coterminous United States—the Cascades and the Sierra Nevada. Aside from elevation,
  geographic continuity, and spectacular scenery, however, the two ranges differ in
  almost every important respect. Except for its northern section, where sedimentary
  and metamorphic rocks occur, the Sierra Nevada is largely made of granite, part
  of the same batholithic chain that creates the Idaho Rockies. The range is grossly
  asymmetrical, the result of massive faulting that has gently tilted the western
  slopes toward the Central Valley but has uplifted the eastern side to confront the
  interior with an escarpment nearly two miles high. At high elevation glaciers have
  scoured the granites to a gleaming white, while on the west the ice has carved spectacular
  valleys such as the Yosemite. The loftiest peak in the Sierras is Mount Whitney,
  which at 14,494 feet (4,418 metres) is the highest mountain in the coterminous states.
  The upfaulting that produced Mount Whitney is accompanied by downfaulting that formed
  nearby Death Valley, at 282 feet (86 metres) below sea level the lowest point in
  North America.The Cascades are made largely of volcanic rock; those in northern
  Washington contain granite like the Sierras, but the rest are formed from relatively
  recent lava outpourings of dun-coloured basalt and andesite. The Cascades are in
  effect two ranges. The lower, older range is a long belt of upwarped lava, rising
  unspectacularly to elevations between 6,000 and 8,000 feet. Perched above the “low
  Cascades” is a chain of lofty volcanoes that punctuate the horizon with magnificent
  glacier-clad peaks. The highest is Mount Rainier, which at 14,410 feet (4,392 metres)
  is all the more dramatic for rising from near sea level. Most of these volcanoes
  are quiescent, but they are far from extinct. Mount Lassen in northern California
  erupted violently in 1914, as did Mount St. Helens in the state of Washington in
  1980. Most of the other high Cascade volcanoes exhibit some sign of seismic activity.Beartooth
  Range© John ElkThe Cordillera’s two main chains enclose a vast intermontane region
  of arid basins, plateaus, and isolated mountain ranges that stretches from the Mexican
  border nearly to Canada and extends 600 miles from east to west. This enormous territory
  contains three huge subregions, each with a distinctive geologic history and its
  own striking topography.The Colorado Plateau, nestled against the western flanks
  of the Southern Rockies, is an extraordinary island of geologic stability set in
  the turbulent sea of Cordilleran tectonic activity. Stability was not absolute,
  of course, so that parts of the plateau are warped and injected with volcanics,
  but in general the landscape results from the erosion by streams of nearly flat-lying
  sedimentary rocks. The result is a mosaic of angular mesas, buttes, and steplike
  canyons intricately cut from rocks that often are vividly coloured. Large areas
  of the plateau are so improbably picturesque that they have been set aside as national
  preserves. The Grand Canyon of the Colorado River is the most famous of several
  dozen such areas.West of the plateau and abutting the Sierra Nevada’s eastern escarpment
  lies the arid Basin and Range subregion, among the most remarkable topographic provinces
  of the United States. The Basin and Range extends from southern Oregon and Idaho
  into northern Mexico. Rocks of great complexity have been broken by faulting, and
  the resulting blocks have tumbled, eroded, and been partly buried by lava and alluvial
  debris accumulating in the desert basins. The eroded blocks form mountain ranges
  that are characteristically dozens of miles long, several thousand feet from base
  to crest, with peak elevations that rarely rise to more than 10,000 feet, and almost
  always aligned roughly north–south. The basin floors are typically alluvium and
  sometimes salt marshes or alkali flats.The third intermontane region, the Columbia
  Basin, is literally the last, for in some parts its rocks are still being formed.
  Its entire area is underlain by innumerable tabular lava flows that have flooded
  the basin between the Cascades and Northern Rockies to undetermined depths. The
  volume of lava must be measured in thousands of cubic miles, for the flows blanket
  large parts of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho and in southern Idaho have drowned
  the flanks of the Northern Rocky Mountains in a basaltic sea. Where the lavas are
  fresh, as in southern Idaho, the surface is often nearly flat, but more often the
  floors have been trenched by rivers—conspicuously the Columbia and the Snake—or
  by glacial floodwaters that have carved an intricate system of braided canyons in
  the remarkable Channeled Scablands of eastern Washington. In surface form the eroded
  lava often resembles the topography of the Colorado Plateau, but the gaudy colours
  of the Colorado are replaced here by the sombre black and rusty brown of weathered
  basalt.Most large mountain systems are sources of varied mineral wealth, and the
  American Cordillera is no exception. Metallic minerals have been taken from most
  crystalline regions and have furnished the United States with both romance and wealth—the
  Sierra Nevada gold that provoked the 1849 gold rush, the fabulous silver lodes of
  western Nevada’s Basin and Range, and gold strikes all along the Rocky Mountain
  chain. Industrial metals, however, are now far more important; copper and lead are
  among the base metals, and the more exotic molybdenum, vanadium, and cadmium are
  mainly useful in alloys.In the Cordillera, as elsewhere, the greatest wealth stems
  from fuels. Most major basins contain oil and natural gas, conspicuously the Wyoming
  Basin, the Central Valley of California, and the Los Angeles Basin. The Colorado
  Plateau, however, has yielded some of the most interesting discoveries—considerable
  deposits of uranium and colossal occurrences of oil shale. Oil from the shale, however,
  probably cannot be economically removed without widespread strip-mining and correspondingly
  large-scale damage to the environment. Wide exploitation of low-sulfur bituminous
  coal has been initiated in the Four Corners area of the Colorado Plateau, and open-pit
  mining has already devastated parts of this once-pristine country as completely
  as it has West Virginia.As befits a nation of continental proportions, the United
  States has an extraordinary network of rivers and lakes, including some of the largest
  and most useful in the world. In the humid East they provide an enormous mileage
  of cheap inland transportation; westward, most rivers and streams are unnavigable
  but are heavily used for irrigation and power generation. Both East and West, however,
  traditionally have used lakes and streams as public sewers, and despite efforts
  to clean them up, most large waterways are laden with vast, poisonous volumes of
  industrial, agricultural, and human wastes.Chief among U.S. rivers is the Mississippi,
  which, with its great tributaries, the Ohio and the Missouri, drains most of the
  midcontinent. The Mississippi is navigable to Minneapolis nearly 1,200 miles by
  air from the Gulf of Mexico; and along with the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence system
  it forms the world’s greatest network of inland waterways. The Mississippi’s eastern
  branches, chiefly the Ohio and the Tennessee, are also navigable for great distances.
  From the west, however, many of its numerous Great Plains tributaries are too seasonal
  and choked with sandbars to be used for shipping. The Missouri, for example, though
  longer than the Mississippi itself, was essentially without navigation until the
  mid-20th century, when a combination of dams, locks, and dredging opened the river
  to barge traffic.The Great Lakes–St. Lawrence system, the other half of the midcontinental
  inland waterway, is connected to the Mississippi–Ohio via Chicago by canals and
  the Illinois River. The five Great Lakes (four of which are shared with Canada)
  constitute by far the largest freshwater lake group in the world and carry a larger
  tonnage of shipping than any other. The three main barriers to navigation—the St.
  Marys Rapids, at Sault Sainte Marie; Niagara Falls; and the rapids of the St. Lawrence—are
  all bypassed by locks, whose 27-foot draft lets ocean vessels penetrate 1,300 miles
  into the continent, as far as Duluth, Minnesota, and Chicago.The third group of
  Eastern rivers drains the coastal strip along the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of
  Mexico. Except for the Rio Grande, which rises west of the Rockies and flows about
  1,900 circuitous miles to the Gulf, few of these coastal rivers measure more than
  300 miles, and most flow in an almost straight line to the sea. Except in glaciated
  New England and in arid southwestern Texas, most of the larger coastal streams are
  navigable for some distance.West of the Rockies, nearly all of the rivers are strongly
  influenced by aridity. In the deserts and steppes of the intermontane basins, most
  of the scanty runoff disappears into interior basins, only one of which, the Great
  Salt Lake, holds any substantial volume of water. Aside from a few minor coastal
  streams, only three large river systems manage to reach the sea—the Columbia, the
  Colorado, and the San Joaquin–Sacramento system of California’s Central Valley.
  All three of these river systems are exotic: that is, they flow for considerable
  distances across dry lands from which they receive little water. Both the Columbia
  and the Colorado have carved awesome gorges, the former through the sombre lavas
  of the Cascades and the Columbia Basin, the latter through the brilliantly coloured
  rocks of the Colorado Plateau. These gorges lend themselves to easy damming, and
  the once-wild Columbia has been turned into a stairway of placid lakes whose waters
  irrigate the arid plateaus of eastern Washington and power one of the world’s largest
  hydroelectric networks. The Colorado is less extensively developed, and proposals
  for new dam construction have met fierce opposition from those who want to preserve
  the spectacular natural beauty of the river’s canyon lands.Climate affects human
  habitats both directly and indirectly through its influence on vegetation, soils,
  and wildlife. In the United States, however, the natural environment has been altered
  drastically by nearly four centuries of European settlement, as well as thousands
  of years of Indian occupancy.Wherever land is abandoned, however, “wild” conditions
  return rapidly, achieving over the long run a dynamic equilibrium among soils, vegetation,
  and the inexorable strictures of climate. Thus, though Americans have created an
  artificial environment of continental proportions, the United States still can be
  divided into a mosaic of bioclimatic regions, each of them distinguished by peculiar
  climatic conditions and each with a potential vegetation and soil that eventually
  would return in the absence of humans. The main exception to this generalization
  applies to fauna, so drastically altered that it is almost impossible to know what
  sort of animal geography would redevelop in the areas of the United States if humans
  were removed from the scene.The pattern of U.S. climates is largely set by the location
  of the coterminous United States almost entirely in the middle latitudes, by its
  position with respect to the continental landmass and its fringing oceans, and by
  the nation’s gross pattern of mountains and lowlands. Each of these geographic controls
  operates to determine the character of air masses and their changing behaviour from
  season to season.The coterminous United States lies entirely between the tropic
  of Cancer and 50° N latitude, a position that confines Arctic climates to the high
  mountaintops and genuine tropics to a small part of southern Florida. By no means,
  however, is the climate literally temperate, for the middle latitudes are notorious
  for extreme variations of temperature and precipitation.The great size of the North
  American landmass tends to reinforce these extremes. Since land heats and cools
  more rapidly than bodies of water, places distant from an ocean tend to have continental
  climates; that is, they alternate between extremes of hot summers and cold winters,
  in contrast to the marine climates, which are more equable. Most U.S. climates are
  markedly continental, the more so because the Cordillera effectively confines the
  moderating Pacific influence to a narrow strip along the West Coast. Extremes of
  continentality occur near the centre of the country, and in North Dakota temperatures
  have ranged between a summer high record of 121 °F (49 °C) and a winter low of −60
  °F (−51 °C). Moreover, the general eastward drift of air over the United States
  carries continental temperatures all the way to the Atlantic coast. Bismarck, N.D.,
  for example, has a great annual temperature range. Boston, on the Atlantic but largely
  exempt from its influence, has a lesser but still-continental range, while San Francisco,
  which is under strong Pacific influence, has only a small summer–winter differential.In
  addition to confining Pacific temperatures to the coastal margin, the Pacific Coast
  Ranges are high enough to make a local rain shadow in their lee, although the main
  barrier is the great rampart formed by the Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges. Rainy
  on their western slopes and barren on the east, this mountain crest forms one of
  the sharpest climatic divides in the United States.The rain shadow continues east
  to the Rockies, leaving the entire Intermontane Region either arid or semiarid,
  except where isolated ranges manage to capture leftover moisture at high altitudes.
  East of the Rockies the westerly drift brings mainly dry air, and as a result, the
  Great Plains are semiarid. Still farther east, humidity increases owing to the frequent
  incursion from the south of warm, moist, and unstable air from the Gulf of Mexico,
  which produces more precipitation in the United States than the Pacific and Atlantic
  oceans combined.Although the landforms of the Interior Lowlands have been termed
  dull, there is nothing dull about their weather conditions. Air from the Gulf of
  Mexico can flow northward across the Great Plains, uninterrupted by topographical
  barriers, but continental Canadian air flows south by the same route, and, since
  these two air masses differ in every important respect, the collisions often produce
  disturbances of monumental violence. Plainsmen and Midwesterners are accustomed
  to sudden displays of furious weather—tornadoes, blizzards, hailstorms, precipitous
  drops and rises in temperature, and a host of other spectacular meteorological displays,
  sometimes dangerous but seldom boring.Most of the United States is marked by sharp
  differences between winter and summer. In winter, when temperature contrasts between
  land and water are greatest, huge masses of frigid, dry Canadian air periodically
  spread far south over the midcontinent, bringing cold, sparkling weather to the
  interior and generating great cyclonic storms where their leading edges confront
  the shrunken mass of warm Gulf air to the south. Although such cyclonic activity
  occurs throughout the year, it is most frequent and intense during the winter, parading
  eastward out of the Great Plains to bring the Eastern states practically all their
  winter precipitation. Winter temperatures differ widely, depending largely on latitude.
  Thus, New Orleans, La., at 30° N latitude, and International Falls, Minn., at 49°
  N, have respective January temperature averages of 55 °F (13 °C) and 3 °F (−16°
  C). In the north, therefore, precipitation often comes as snow, often driven by
  furious winds; farther south, cold rain alternates with sleet and occasional snow.
  Southern Florida is the only dependably warm part of the East, though “polar outbursts”
  have been known to bring temperatures below 0 °F (−18 °C) as far south as Tallahassee.
  The main uniformity of Eastern weather in wintertime is the expectation of frequent
  change.Winter climate on the West Coast is very different. A great spiraling mass
  of relatively warm, moist air spreads south from the Aleutian Islands of Alaska,
  its semipermanent front producing gloomy overcast and drizzles that hang over the
  Pacific Northwest all winter long, occasionally reaching southern California, which
  receives nearly all of its rain at this time of year. This Pacific air brings mild
  temperatures along the length of the coast; the average January day in Seattle,
  Wash., ranges between 33 and 44 °F (1 and 7 °C) and in Los Angeles between 45 and
  64 °F (7 and 18 °C). In southern California, however, rains are separated by long
  spells of fair weather, and the whole region is a winter haven for those seeking
  refuge from less agreeable weather in other parts of the country. The Intermontane
  Region is similar to the Pacific Coast, but with much less rainfall and a considerably
  wider range of temperatures.During the summer there is a reversal of the air masses,
  and east of the Rockies the change resembles the summer monsoon of Southeast Asia.
  As the midcontinent heats up, the cold Canadian air mass weakens and retreats, pushed
  north by an aggressive mass of warm, moist air from the Gulf. The great winter temperature
  differential between North and South disappears as the hot, soggy blanket spreads
  from the Gulf coast to the Canadian border. Heat and humidity are naturally most
  oppressive in the South, but there is little comfort in the more northern latitudes.
  In Houston, Texas, the temperature on a typical July day reaches 93 °F (34 °C),
  with relative humidity averaging near 75 percent, but Minneapolis, Minn., more than
  1,000 miles north, is only slightly cooler and less humid.Since the Gulf air is
  unstable as well as wet, convectional and frontal summer thunderstorms are endemic
  east of the Rockies, accounting for a majority of total summer rain. These storms
  usually drench small areas with short-lived, sometimes violent downpours, so that
  crops in one Midwestern county may prosper, those in another shrivel in drought,
  and those in yet another be flattened by hailstones. Relief from the humid heat
  comes in the northern Midwest from occasional outbursts of cool Canadian air; small
  but more consistent relief is found downwind from the Great Lakes and at high elevations
  in the Appalachians. East of the Rockies, however, U.S. summers are distinctly uncomfortable,
  and air conditioning is viewed as a desirable amenity in most areas.The Pacific
  Region: GeographyEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Again, the Pacific regime is different.
  The moist Aleutian air retreats northward, to be replaced by mild, stable air from
  over the subtropical but cool waters of the Pacific, and except in the mountains
  the Pacific Coast is nearly rainless though often foggy. In the meanwhile, a small
  but potent mass of dry hot air raises temperatures to blistering levels over much
  of the intermontane Southwest. In Yuma, Ariz., for example, the normal temperature
  in July reaches 107 °F (42 °C), while nearby Death Valley, Calif., holds the national
  record, 134 °F (57 °C). During its summer peak this scorching air mass spreads from
  the Pacific margin as far as Texas on the east and Idaho to the north, turning the
  whole interior basin into a summer desert.Over most of the United States, as in
  most continental climates, spring and autumn are agreeable but disappointingly brief.
  Autumn is particularly idyllic in the East, with a romantic Indian summer of ripening
  corn and brilliantly coloured foliage and of mild days and frosty nights. The shift
  in dominance between marine and continental air masses, however, spawns furious
  weather in some regions. Along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, for example, autumn
  is the season for hurricanes—the American equivalent of typhoons of the Asian Pacific—which
  rage northward from the warm tropics to create havoc along the Gulf and Atlantic
  coasts as far north as New England. The Mississippi valley holds the dubious distinction
  of recording more tornadoes than any other area on Earth. These violent and often
  deadly storms usually occur over relatively small areas and are confined largely
  to spring and early summer.Three first-order bioclimatic zones encompass most of
  the coterminous United States—regions in which climatic conditions are similar enough
  to dictate similar conditions of mature (zonal) soil and potential climax vegetation
  (i.e., the assemblage of plants that would grow and reproduce indefinitely given
  stable climate and average conditions of soil and drainage). These are the Humid
  East, the Humid Pacific Coast, and the Dry West. In addition, the boundary zone
  between the Humid East and the Dry West is so large and important that it constitutes
  a separate region, the Humid–Arid Transition. Finally, because the Western Cordillera
  contains an intricate mosaic of climatic types, largely determined by local elevation
  and exposure, it is useful to distinguish the Western Mountain Climate. The first
  three zones, however, are very diverse and require further breakdown, producing
  a total of 10 main bioclimatic regions. For two reasons, the boundaries of these
  bioclimatic regions are much less distinct than boundaries of landform regions.
  First, climate varies from year to year, especially in boundary zones, whereas landforms
  obviously do not. Second, regions of climate, vegetation, and soils coincide generally
  but sometimes not precisely. Boundaries, therefore, should be interpreted as zonal
  and transitional, and rarely should be considered as sharp lines in the landscape.For
  all of their indistinct boundaries, however, these bioclimatic regions have strong
  and easily recognized identities. Such regional identity is strongly reinforced
  when a particular area falls entirely within a single bioclimatic region and at
  the same time a single landform region. The result—as in the Piedmont South, the
  central Midwest, or the western Great Plains—is a landscape with an unmistakable
  regional personality.The largest and in some ways the most important of the bioclimatic
  zones, the Humid East was where the Europeans first settled, tamed the land, and
  adapted to American conditions. In early times almost all of this territory was
  forested, a fact of central importance in American history that profoundly influenced
  both soils and wildlife. As in most of the world’s humid lands, soluble minerals
  have been leached from the earth, leaving a great family of soils called pedalfers,
  rich in relatively insoluble iron and aluminum compounds.Both forests and soils,
  however, differ considerably within this vast region. Since rainfall is ample and
  summers are warm everywhere, the main differences result from the length and severity
  of winters, which determine the length of the growing season. Winter, obviously,
  differs according to latitude, so that the Humid East is sliced into four great
  east–west bands of soils and vegetation, with progressively more amenable winters
  as one travels southward. These changes occur very gradually, however, and the boundaries
  therefore are extremely subtle.The Sub-Boreal Forest Region is the northernmost
  of these bands. It is only a small and discontinuous part of the United States,
  representing the tattered southern fringe of the vast Canadian taiga—a scrubby forest
  dominated by evergreen needle-leaf species that can endure the ferocious winters
  and reproduce during the short, erratic summers. Average growing seasons are less
  than 120 days, though localities in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula have recorded frost-free
  periods lasting as long as 161 days and as short as 76 days. Soils of this region
  that survived the scour of glaciation are miserably thin podzols—heavily leached,
  highly acid, and often interrupted by extensive stretches of bog. Most attempts
  at farming in the region long since have been abandoned.Farther south lies the Humid
  Microthermal Zone of milder winters and longer summers. Large broadleaf trees begin
  to predominate over the evergreens, producing a mixed forest of greater floristic
  variety and economic value that is famous for its brilliant autumn colours. As the
  forest grows richer in species, sterile podzols give way to more productive gray-brown
  podzolic soils, stained and fertilized with humus. Although winters are warmer than
  in the Sub-Boreal zone, and although the Great Lakes help temper the bitterest cold,
  January temperatures ordinarily average below freezing, and a winter without a few
  days of subzero temperatures is uncommon. Everywhere, the ground is solidly frozen
  and snow covered for several months of the year.Still farther south are the Humid
  Subtropics. The region’s northern boundary is one of the country’s most significant
  climatic lines: the approximate northern limit of a growing season of 180–200 days,
  the outer margin of cotton growing, and, hence, of the Old South. Most of the South
  lies in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain, for higher elevations in the Appalachians
  cause a peninsula of Northern mixed forest to extend as far south as northern Georgia.
  The red-brown podzolic soil, once moderately fertile, has been severely damaged
  by overcropping and burning. Thus much of the region that once sustained a rich,
  broadleaf-forest flora now supports poor piney woods. Throughout the South, summers
  are hot, muggy, long, and disagreeable; Dixie’s “frosty mornings” bring a welcome
  respite in winter.The southern margins of Florida contain the only real tropics
  in the coterminous United States; it is an area in which frost is almost unknown.
  Hot, rainy summers alternate with warm and somewhat drier winters, with a secondary
  rainfall peak during the autumn hurricane season—altogether a typical monsoonal
  regime. Soils and vegetation are mostly immature, however, since southern Florida
  rises so slightly above sea level that substantial areas, such as the Everglades,
  are swampy and often brackish. Peat and sand frequently masquerade as soil, and
  much of the vegetation is either salt-loving mangrove or sawgrass prairie.The western
  humid region differs from its eastern counterpart in so many ways as to be a world
  apart. Much smaller, it is crammed into a narrow littoral belt to the windward of
  the Sierra–Cascade summit, dominated by mild Pacific air, and chopped by irregular
  topography into an intricate mosaic of climatic and biotic habitats. Throughout
  the region rainfall is extremely seasonal, falling mostly in the winter half of
  the year. Summers are droughty everywhere, but the main regional differences come
  from the length of drought—from about two months in humid Seattle, Wash., to nearly
  five months in semiarid San Diego, Calif.Western Washington, Oregon, and northern
  California lie within a zone that climatologists call Marine West Coast. Winters
  are raw, overcast, and drizzly—not unlike northwestern Europe—with subfreezing temperatures
  restricted mainly to the mountains, upon which enormous snow accumulations produce
  local alpine glaciers. Summers, by contrast, are brilliantly cloudless, cool, and
  frequently foggy along the West Coast and somewhat warmer in the inland valleys.
  This mild marine climate produces some of the world’s greatest forests of enormous
  straight-boled evergreen trees that furnish the United States with much of its commercial
  timber. Mature soils are typical of humid midlatitude forestlands, a moderately
  leached gray-brown podzol.Toward the south, with diminishing coastal rain the moist
  marine climate gradually gives way to California’s tiny but much-publicized Mediterranean
  regime. Although mountainous topography introduces a bewildering variety of local
  environments, scanty winter rains are quite inadequate to compensate for the long
  summer drought, and much of the region has a distinctly arid character. For much
  of the year, cool, stable Pacific air dominates the West Coast, bringing San Francisco
  its famous fogs and Los Angeles its infamous smoggy temperature inversions. Inland,
  however, summer temperatures reach blistering levels, so that in July, while Los
  Angeles expects a normal daily maximum of 83 °F (28 °C), Fresno expects 100 °F (38
  °C) and is climatically a desert. As might be expected, Mediterranean California
  contains a huge variety of vegetal habitats, but the commonest perhaps is the chaparral,
  a drought-resistant, scrubby woodland of twisted hard-leafed trees, picturesque
  but of little economic value. Chaparral is a pyrophytic (fire-loving) vegetation—i.e.,
  under natural conditions its growth and form depend on regular burning. These fires
  constitute a major environmental hazard in the suburban hills above Los Angeles
  and San Francisco Bay, especially in autumn, when hot dry Santa Ana winds from the
  interior regularly convert brush fires into infernos. Soils are similarly varied,
  but most of them are light in colour and rich in soluble minerals, qualities typical
  of subarid soils.In the United States, to speak of dry areas is to speak of the
  West. It covers an enormous region beyond the dependable reach of moist oceanic
  air, occupying the entire Intermontane area and sprawling from Canada to Mexico
  across the western part of the Great Plains. To Americans nurtured in the Humid
  East, this vast territory across the path of all transcontinental travelers has
  been harder to tame than any other—and no region has so gripped the national imagination
  as this fierce and dangerous land.In the Dry West nothing matters more than water.
  Thus, though temperatures may differ radically from place to place, the really important
  regional differences depend overwhelmingly on the degree of aridity, whether an
  area is extremely dry and hence desert or semiarid and therefore steppe.Americans
  of the 19th century were preoccupied by the myth of a Great American Desert, which
  supposedly occupied more than one-third of the entire country. True desert, however,
  is confined to the Southwest, with patchy outliers elsewhere, all without exception
  located in the lowland rain shadows of the Cordillera. Vegetation in these desert
  areas varies between nothing at all (a rare circumstance confined mainly to salt
  flats and sand dunes) to a low cover of scattered woody scrub and short-lived annuals
  that burst into flamboyant bloom after rains. Soils are usually thin, light-coloured,
  and very rich with mineral salts. In some areas wind erosion has removed fine-grained
  material, leaving behind desert pavement, a barren veneer of broken rock.Most of
  the West, however, lies in the semiarid region, in which rainfall is scanty but
  adequate to support a thin cover of short bunchgrass, commonly alternating with
  scrubby brush. Here, as in the desert, soils fall into the large family of the pedocals,
  rich in calcium and other soluble minerals, but in the slightly wetter environments
  of the West, they are enriched with humus from decomposed grass roots. Under the
  proper type of management, these chestnut-coloured steppe soils have the potential
  to be very fertile.Weather in the West resembles that of other dry regions of the
  world, often extreme, violent, and reliably unreliable. Rainfall, for example, obeys
  a cruel natural law: as total precipitation decreases, it becomes more undependable.
  John Steinbeck’s novel The Grapes of Wrath describes the problems of a family enticed
  to the arid frontier of Oklahoma during a wet period only to be driven out by the
  savage drought of the 1930s that turned the western Great Plains into the great
  American Dust Bowl. Temperatures in the West also fluctuate convulsively within
  short periods, and high winds are infamous throughout the region.East of the Rockies
  all climatic boundaries are gradational. None, however, is so important or so imperceptibly
  subtle as the boundary zone that separates the Humid East from the Dry West and
  that alternates unpredictably between arid and humid conditions from year to year.
  Stretching approximately from Texas to North Dakota in an ill-defined band between
  the 95th and 100th meridians, this transitional region deserves separate recognition,
  partly because of its great size, and partly because of the fine balance between
  surplus and deficit rainfall, which produces a unique and valuable combination of
  soils, flora, and fauna. The native vegetation, insofar as it can be reconstructed,
  was prairie, the legendary sea of tall, deep-rooted grass now almost entirely tilled
  and planted to grains. Soils, often of loessial derivation, include the enormously
  productive chernozem (black earth) in the north, with reddish prairie soils of nearly
  equal fertility in the south. Throughout the region temperatures are severely continental,
  with bitterly cold winters in the north and scorching summers everywhere.The western
  edge of the prairie fades gradually into the shortgrass steppe of the High Plains,
  the change a function of diminishing rainfall. The eastern edge, however, represents
  one of the few major discordances between a climatic and biotic boundary in the
  United States, for the grassland penetrates the eastern forest in a great salient
  across humid Illinois and Indiana. Many scholars believe this part of the prairie
  was artificially induced by repeated burning and consequent destruction of the forest
  margins by Indians.Throughout the Cordillera and Intermontane regions, irregular
  topography shatters the grand bioclimatic pattern into an intricate mosaic of tiny
  regions that differ drastically according to elevation and exposure. No small- or
  medium-scale map can accurately record such complexity, and mountainous parts of
  the West are said, noncommittally, to have a “mountain climate.” Lowlands are usually
  dry, but increasing elevation brings lower temperature, decreased evaporation, and—if
  a slope faces prevailing winds—greater precipitation. Soils vary wildly from place
  to place, but vegetation is fairly predictable. From the desert or steppe of intermontane
  valleys, a climber typically ascends into parklike savanna, then through an orderly
  sequence of increasingly humid and boreal forests until, if the range is high enough,
  one reaches the timberline and Arctic tundra. The very highest peaks are snow-capped,
  although permanent glaciers rarely occur outside the cool humid highlands of the
  Pacific Northwest.The dominant features of the vegetation are indicated by the terms
  forest, grassland, desert, and alpine tundra.A coniferous forest of white and red
  pine, hemlock, spruce, jack pine, and balsam fir extends interruptedly in a narrow
  strip near the Canadian border from Maine to Minnesota and southward along the Appalachian
  Mountains. There may be found smaller stands of tamarack, spruce, paper birch, willow,
  alder, and aspen or poplar. Southward, a transition zone of mixed conifers and deciduous
  trees gives way to a hardwood forest of broad-leaved trees. This forest, with varying
  mixtures of maple, oak, ash, locust, linden, sweet gum, walnut, hickory, sycamore,
  beech, and the more southerly tulip tree, once extended uninterruptedly from New
  England to Missouri and eastern Texas. Pines are prominent on the Atlantic and Gulf
  coastal plain and adjacent uplands, often occurring in nearly pure stands called
  pine barrens. Pitch, longleaf, slash, shortleaf, Virginia, and loblolly pines are
  commonest. Hickory and various oaks combine to form a significant part of this forest,
  with magnolia, white cedar, and ash often seen. In the frequent swamps, bald cypress,
  tupelo, and white cedar predominate. Pines, palmettos, and live oaks are replaced
  at the southern tip of Florida by the more tropical royal and thatch palms, figs,
  satinwood, and mangrove.The grasslands occur principally in the Great Plains area
  and extend westward into the intermontane basins and benchlands of the Rocky Mountains.
  Numerous grasses such as buffalo, grama, side oat, bunch, needle, and wheat grass,
  together with many kinds of herbs, make up the plant cover. Coniferous forests cover
  the lesser mountains and high plateaus of the Rockies, Cascades, and Sierra Nevada.
  Ponderosa (yellow) pine, Douglas fir, western red cedar, western larch, white pine,
  lodgepole pine, several spruces, western hemlock, grand fir, red fir, and the lofty
  redwood are the principal trees of these forests. The densest growth occurs west
  of the Cascade and Coast ranges in Washington, Oregon, and northern California,
  where the trees are often 100 feet or more in height. There the forest floor is
  so dark that only ferns, mosses, and a few shade-loving shrubs and herbs may be
  found.Arizona: Saguaro National MonumentEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The alpine
  tundra, located in the coterminous United States only in the mountains above the
  limit of trees, consists principally of small plants that bloom brilliantly for
  a short season. Sagebrush is the most common plant of the arid basins and semideserts
  west of the Rocky Mountains, but juniper, nut pine, and mountain mahogany are often
  found on the slopes and low ridges. The desert, extending from southeastern California
  to Texas, is noted for the many species of cactus, some of which grow to the height
  of trees, and for the Joshua tree and other yuccas, creosote bush, mesquite, and
  acacias.The United States is rich in the variety of its native forest trees, some
  of which, as the species of sequoia, are the most massive known. More than 1,000
  species and varieties have been described, of which almost 200 are of economic value,
  either because of the timber and other useful products that they yield or by reason
  of their importance in forestry.Besides the native flowering plants, estimated at
  between 20,000 to 25,000 species, many hundreds of species introduced from other
  regions—chiefly Europe, Asia, and tropical America—have become naturalized. A large
  proportion of these are common annual weeds of fields, pastures, and roadsides.
  In some districts these naturalized “aliens” constitute 50 percent or more of the
  total plant population.With most of North America, the United States lies in the
  Nearctic faunistic realm, a region containing an assemblage of species similar to
  Eurasia and North Africa but sharply different from the tropical and subtropical
  zones to the south. Main regional differences correspond roughly with primary climatic
  and vegetal patterns. Thus, for example, the animal communities of the Dry West
  differ sharply from those of the Humid East and from those of the Pacific Coast.
  Because animals tend to range over wider areas than plants, faunal regions are generally
  coarser than vegetal regions and harder to delineate sharply.The animal geography
  of the United States, however, is far from a natural pattern, for European settlement
  produced a series of environmental changes that grossly altered the distribution
  of animal communities. First, many species were hunted to extinction or near extinction,
  most conspicuously, perhaps, the American bison, which ranged by the millions nearly
  from coast to coast but now rarely lives outside of zoos and wildlife preserves.
  Second, habitats were upset or destroyed throughout most of the country—forests
  cut, grasslands plowed and overgrazed, and migration paths interrupted by fences,
  railroads, and highways. Third, certain introduced species found hospitable niches
  and, like the English sparrow, spread over huge areas, often preempting the habitats
  of native animals. Fourth, though their effects are not fully understood, chemical
  biocides such as DDT were used for so long and in such volume that they are believed
  at least partly responsible for catastrophic mortality rates among large mammals
  and birds, especially predators high on the food chain. Fifth, there has been a
  gradual northward migration of certain tropical and subtropical insects, birds,
  and mammals, perhaps encouraged by gradual climatic warming. In consequence, many
  native animals have been reduced to tiny fractions of their former ranges or exterminated
  completely, while other animals, both native and introduced, have found the new
  anthropocentric environment well suited to their needs, with explosive effects on
  their populations. The coyote, opossum, armadillo, and several species of deer are
  among the animals that now occupy much larger ranges than they once did.Arrangement
  of the account of the distribution of the fauna according to the climatic and vegetal
  regions has the merit that it can be compared further with the distribution of insects
  and of other invertebrates, some of which may be expected to fall into the same
  patterns as the vertebrates, while others, with different modes or different ages
  of dispersal, have geographic patterns of their own.The transcontinental zone of
  coniferous forest at the north, the taiga, and the tundra zone into which it merges
  at the northern limit of tree growth are strikingly paralleled by similar vertical
  zones in the Rockies, and on Mount Washington in the east, where the area above
  the timberline and below the snow line is often inhabited with tundra animals like
  the ptarmigan and the white Parnassius butterflies, while the spruce and other conifers
  below the timberline form a belt sharply set off from the grassland or hardwood
  forest or desert at still lower altitudes.A whole series of important types of animals
  spread beyond the limits of such regions or zones, sometimes over most of the continent.
  Aquatic animals, in particular, may live equally in forest and plains, in the Gulf
  states, and at the Canadian border. Such widespread animals include the white-tailed
  (Virginia) deer and black bear, the puma (though only in the remotest parts of its
  former range) and bobcat, the river otter (though now rare in inland areas south
  of the Great Lakes) and mink, and the beaver and muskrat. The distinctive coyote
  ranges over all of western North America and eastward as far as Maine. The snapping
  turtle ranges from the Atlantic coast to the Rocky Mountains.In the northern coniferous
  forest zone, or taiga, the relations of animals with European or Eurasian representatives
  are numerous, and this zone is also essentially circumpolar. The relations are less
  close than in the Arctic forms, but the moose, beaver, hare, red fox, otter, wolverine,
  and wolf are recognizably related to Eurasian animals. Even some fishes, like the
  whitefishes (Coregonidae), the yellow perch, and the pike, exhibit this kind of
  Old World–New World relation. A distinctively North American animal in this taiga
  assemblage is the Canadian porcupine.The hardwood forest area of the eastern and
  the southeastern pinelands compose the most important of the faunal regions within
  the United States. A great variety of fishes, amphibians, and reptiles of this region
  have related forms in East Asia, and this pattern of representation is likewise
  found in the flora. This area is rich in catfishes, minnows, and suckers. The curious
  ganoid fishes, the bowfin and the gar, are ancient types. The spoonbill cat, a remarkable
  type of sturgeon in the lower Mississippi, is represented elsewhere in the world
  only in the Yangtze in China. The Appalachian region is headquarters for the salamanders
  of the world, with no less than seven of the eight families of this large group
  of amphibians represented; no other continent has more than three of the eight families
  together. The eellike sirens and amphiumas (congo snakes) are confined to the southeastern
  states. The lungless salamanders of the family Plethodontidae exhibit a remarkable
  variety of genera and a number of species centring in the Appalachians. There is
  a great variety of frogs, and these include tree frogs whose main development is
  South American and Australian. The emydid freshwater turtles of the southeast parallel
  those of East Asia to a remarkable degree, though the genus Clemmys is the only
  one represented in both regions. Much the same is true of the water snakes, pit
  vipers, rat snakes, and green snakes, though still others are peculiarly American.
  The familiar alligator is a form with an Asiatic relative, the only other living
  true alligator being a species in central China.In its mammals and birds the southeastern
  fauna is less sharply distinguished from the life to the north and west and is less
  directly related to that of East Asia. The forest is the home of the white-tailed
  deer, the black bear, the gray fox, the raccoon, and the common opossum. The wild
  turkey and the extinct hosts of the passenger pigeon were characteristic. There
  is a remarkable variety of woodpeckers. The birdlife in general tends to differ
  from that of Eurasia in the presence of birds, like the tanagers, American orioles,
  and hummingbirds, that belong to South American families. Small mammals abound with
  types of the worldwide rodent family Cricetidae, and with distinctive moles and
  shrews.Most distinctive of the grassland animals proper is the American bison (see
  photograph), whose nearly extinct European relative, the wisent, is a forest dweller.
  The most distinctive of the American hoofed animals is the pronghorn, or prongbuck,
  which represents a family intermediate between the deer and the true antelopes in
  that it sheds its horns like a deer but retains the bony horn cores. The pronghorn
  is perhaps primarily a desert mammal, but it formerly ranged widely into the shortgrass
  plains. Everywhere in open country in the West there are conspicuous and distinctive
  rodents. The burrowing pocket gopher is peculiarly American, rarely seen making
  its presence known by pushed-out mounds of earth. The ground squirrels of the genus
  Citellus are related to those of Central Asia, and resemble them in habit; in North
  America the gregarious prairie dog is a closely related form. The American badger
  (see photograph), not especially related to the badger of Europe, has its headquarters
  in the grasslands. The prairie chicken is a bird distinctive of the plains region,
  which is invaded everywhere by birds from both the east and the west.The Southwestern
  deserts are a paradise for reptiles. Distinctive lizards such as the poisonous Gila
  monster abound, and the rattlesnakes, of which only a few species are found elsewhere
  in the United States, are common there. Desert reptile species often range to the
  Pacific Coast and northward into the Great Basin. Noteworthy mammals are the graceful
  bipedal kangaroo rat (almost exlusively nocturnal; see photograph), the ring-tailed
  cat, a relative of the raccoon, and the piglike peccary.The Rocky Mountains and
  other western ranges afford distinctive habitats for rock- and cliff-dwelling hoofed
  animals and rodents. The small pikas, related to the rabbit, inhabit talus areas
  at high altitudes as they do in the mountain ranges of East Asia. Marmots live in
  the Rockies as in the Alps. Every western range formerly had its own race of mountain
  sheep. At the north the Rocky Mountain goat lives at high altitudes—it is more properly
  a goat antelope, related to the takin of the mountains of western China. The dipper,
  remarkable for its habit of feeding in swift-flowing streams, though otherwise a
  bird without special aquatic adaptations, is a Rocky Mountain form with relatives
  in Asia and Europe.In the Pacific region the extremely distinctive primitive tailed
  frog Ascaphus, which inhabits icy mountain brooks, represents a family by itself,
  perhaps more nearly related to the frogs of New Zealand than to more familiar types.
  The Cascades and Sierras form centres for salamanders of the families Ambystomoidae
  and Plethodontidae second only to the Appalachians, and there are also distinctive
  newts. The burrowing lizards, of the well-defined family Anniellidae, are found
  only in a limited area in coastal California. The only family of birds distinctive
  of North America, that of the wren-tits, Chamaeidae, is found in the chaparral of
  California. The mountain beaver, or sewellel (which is not at all beaverlike), is
  likewise a type peculiar to North America, confined to the Cascades and Sierras,
  and there are distinct kinds of moles in the Pacific area.The mammals of the two
  coasts are strikingly different, though true seals (the harbour seal and the harp
  seal) are found on both. The sea lions, with longer necks and with projecting ears,
  are found only in the Pacific—the California sea lion, the more northern Steller’s
  sea lion, and the fur seal. On the East Coast the larger rivers of Florida are inhabited
  by the Florida manatee, or sea cow, a close relative of the more widespread and
  more distinctively marine West Indian species.United States: population densityEncyclopædia
  Britannica, Inc.Although the land that now constitutes the United States was occupied
  and much affected by diverse Indian cultures over many millennia, these pre-European
  settlement patterns have had virtually no impact upon the contemporary nation—except
  locally, as in parts of New Mexico. A benign habitat permitted a huge contiguous
  tract of settled land to materialize across nearly all the eastern half of the United
  States and within substantial patches of the West. The vastness of the land, the
  scarcity of labour, and the abundance of migratory opportunities in a land replete
  with raw physical resources contributed to exceptional human mobility and a quick
  succession of ephemeral forms of land use and settlement. Human endeavours have
  greatly transformed the landscape, but such efforts have been largely destructive.
  Most of the pre-European landscape in the United States was so swiftly and radically
  altered that it is difficult to conjecture intelligently about its earlier appearance.The
  overall impression of the settled portion of the American landscape, rural or urban,
  is one of disorder and incoherence, even in areas of strict geometric survey. The
  individual landscape unit is seldom in visual harmony with its neighbour, so that,
  however sound in design or construction the single structure may be, the general
  effect is untidy. These attributes have been intensified by the acute individualism
  of the American, vigorous speculation in land and other commodities, a strongly
  utilitarian attitude toward the land and the treasures above and below it, and government
  policy and law. The landscape is also remarkable for its extensive transportation
  facilities, which have greatly influenced the configuration of the land.Another
  special characteristic of American settlement, one that became obvious only by the
  mid-20th century, is the convergence of rural and urban modes of life. The farmsteads—and
  rural folk in general—have become increasingly urbanized, and agricultural operations
  have become more automated, while the metropolis grows more gelatinous, unfocused,
  and pseudo-bucolic along its margins.Patterns of rural settlement indicate much
  about the history, economy, society, and minds of those who created them as well
  as about the land itself. The essential design of rural activity in the United States
  bears a strong family resemblance to that of other neo-European lands, such as Canada,
  Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, or tsarist Siberia—places that
  have undergone rapid occupation and exploitation by immigrants intent upon short-term
  development and enrichment. In all such areas, under novel social and political
  conditions and with a relative abundance of territory and physical resources, ideas
  and institutions derived from a relatively stable medieval or early modern Europe
  have undergone major transformation. Further, these are nonpeasant countrysides,
  alike in having failed to achieve the intimate symbiosis of people and habitat,
  the humanized rural landscapes characteristic of many relatively dense, stable,
  earthbound communities in parts of Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America.From
  the beginning the prevalent official policy of the British (except between 1763
  and 1776) and then of the U.S. government was to promote agricultural and other
  settlement—to push the frontier westward as fast as physical and economic conditions
  permitted. The British crown’s grants of large, often vaguely specified tracts to
  individual proprietors or companies enabled the grantees to draw settlers by the
  sale or lease of land at attractive prices or even by outright gift.Of the numerous
  attempts at group colonization, the most notable effort was the theocratic and collectivist
  New England town that flourished, especially in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and
  New Hampshire, during the first century of settlement. The town, the basic unit
  of government and comparable in area to townships in other states, allotted both
  rural and village parcels to single families by group decision. Contrary to earlier
  scholarly belief, in all but a few cases settlement was spatially dispersed in the
  socially cohesive towns, at least until about 1800. The relatively concentrated
  latter-day villages persist today as amoeba-like entities straggling along converging
  roads, neither fully rural nor agglomerated in form. The only latter-day settlement
  experiment of notable magnitude to achieve enduring success was a series of Mormon
  settlements in the Great Basin region of Utah and adjacent states, with their tightly
  concentrated farm villages reminiscent of the New England model. Other efforts have
  been made along ethnic, religious, or political lines, but success has been at best
  brief and fragile.With the coming of independence and after complex negotiations,
  the original 13 states surrendered to the new national government nearly all their
  claims to the unsettled western lands beyond their boundaries. Some tracts, however,
  were reserved for disposal to particular groups. Thus, the Western Reserve of northeastern
  Ohio gave preferential treatment to natives of Connecticut, while the military tracts
  in Ohio and Indiana were used as bonus payments to veterans of the American Revolution.A
  federally administered national domain was created, to which the great bulk of the
  territory acquired in 1803 in the Louisiana Purchase and later beyond the Mississippi
  and in 1819 in Florida was consigned. The only major exceptions were the public
  lands of Texas, which were left within that state’s jurisdiction; such earlier French
  and Spanish land grants as were confirmed, often after tortuous litigation; and
  some Indian lands. In sharp contrast to the slipshod methods of colonial land survey
  and disposal, the federal land managers expeditiously surveyed, numbered, and mapped
  their territory in advance of settlement, beginning with Ohio in the 1780s, then
  sold or deeded it to settlers under inviting terms at a number of regional land
  offices.The design universally followed in the new survey system (except within
  the French, Spanish, and Indian grants) was a simple, efficient rectangular scheme.
  Townships were laid out as blocks, each six by six miles in size, oriented with
  the compass directions. Thirty-six sections, each one square mile, or 640 acres
  (260 hectares), in size, were designated within each township; and public roads
  were established along section lines and, where needed, along half-section lines.
  At irregular intervals, offsets in survey lines and roads were introduced to allow
  for the Earth’s curvature. Individual property lines were coincident with, or parallel
  to, survey lines, and this pervasive rectangularity generally carried over into
  the geometry of fields and fences or into the townsites later superimposed upon
  the basic rural survey.This all-encompassing checkerboard pattern is best appreciated
  from an airplane window over Iowa or Kansas. There, one sees few streams or other
  natural features and few diagonal highways or railroads interrupting the overwhelming
  squareness of the landscape. A systematic rectangular layout, rather less rigorous
  in form, also appears in much of Texas and in those portions of Maine, western New
  York and Pennsylvania, and southern Georgia that were settled after the 1780s.Since
  its formation, Congress has enacted a series of complex schemes for distribution
  of the national domain. The most famous of these plans was the Homestead Act of
  1862, which offered title to 160 acres to individual settlers, subject only to residence
  for a certain period of time and to the making of minimal improvements to the land
  thus acquired. The legal provisions of such acts have varied with time as the nature
  of farming technology and of the remaining lands have changed, but their general
  effect has been to perpetuate the Jeffersonian ideal of a republic in which yeoman
  farmers own and till self-sufficient properties.The program was successful in providing
  private owners with relatively choice lands, aside from parcels reserved for schools
  and various township and municipal uses. More than one-third of the national territory,
  however, is still owned by federal and state governments, with much of this land
  in forest and wildlife preserves. A large proportion of this land is in the West
  and is unsuited for intensive agriculture or grazing because of the roughness, dryness,
  or salinity of the terrain; much of it is leased out for light grazing or for timber
  cutting.During the classic period of American rural life, around 1900, the typical
  American lived or worked on a farm or was economically dependent upon farmers. In
  contrast to rural life in many other parts of the world, the farm family lived on
  an isolated farmstead some distance from town and often from farm neighbours; its
  property averaged less than one-quarter square mile. This farmstead varied in form
  and content with local tradition and economy. In particular, barn types were localized—for
  example, the tobacco barns of the South, the great dairy barns of Wisconsin, or
  the general-purpose forebay barns of southeastern Pennsylvania—as were modes of
  fencing. In general, however, the farmstead contained dwelling, barn, storage and
  sheds for small livestock and equipment, a small orchard, and a kitchen garden.
  A woodlot might be found in the least-accessible or least-fertile part of the farm.Successions
  of such farms were connected with one another and with the towns by means of a dense,
  usually rectangular lattice of roads, largely unimproved at the time. The hamlets,
  villages, and smaller cities were arrayed at relatively regular intervals, with
  size and affluence determined in large part by the presence and quality of rail
  service or status as the county seat. But, among people who have been historically
  rural, individualistic, and antiurban in bias, many services normally located in
  urban places might be found in rustic settings. Thus, much retail business was transacted
  by means of itinerant peddlers, while small shops for the fabrication, distribution,
  or repair of various items were often located in isolated farmsteads, as were many
  post offices.Social activity also tended to be widely dispersed among numerous rural
  churches, schools, or grange halls; and the climactic event of the year might well
  be the county fair, political rally, or religious encampment—again on a rural site.
  Not the least symptomatic sign of the strong tendency toward spatial isolation are
  the countless family burial plots or community cemeteries so liberally distributed
  across the countryside.There has been much regional variation among smaller villages
  and hamlets, but such phenomena have received relatively little attention from students
  of American culture or geography. The distinctive New England village, of course,
  is generally recognized and cherished: it consists of a loose clustering of white
  frame buildings, including a church (usually Congregationalist or Unitarian), town
  hall, shops, and stately homes with tall shade trees around the central green, or
  commons—a grassy expanse that may contain a bandstand and monuments or flowers.
  Derivative village forms were later carried westward to sections of the northern
  Midwest.Less widely known but equally distinctive is the town morphology characteristic
  of the Midland, or Pennsylvanian, culture area and most fully developed in southeastern
  and central Pennsylvania and Piedmont Maryland. It differs totally from the New
  England model in density, building materials, and general appearance. Closely packed,
  often contiguous buildings—mostly brick, but sometimes stone, frame, or stucco—abut
  directly on a sidewalk, which is often paved with brick and usually thickly planted
  with maple, sycamore, or other shade trees. Such towns are characteristically linear
  in plan, have dwellings intermingled with other types of buildings, have only one
  or two principal streets, and may radiate outward from a central square lined with
  commercial and governmental structures.Midwest States: History and PeopleEncyclopædia
  Britannica, Inc.The most characteristic U.S. small town is the one whose pattern
  evolved in the Midwest. Its simple scheme is usually based on the grid plan. Functions
  are rigidly segregated spatially, with the central business district, consisting
  of closely packed two- or three-story brick buildings, limited exclusively to commercial
  and administrative activity. The residences, generally set well back within spacious
  lots, are peripheral in location, as are most rail facilities, factories, and warehouses.Even
  the modest urbanization of the small town came late to the South. Most urban functions
  long were spatially dispersed—almost totally so in the early Chesapeake Bay country
  or North Carolina—or were performed entirely by the larger plantations dominating
  the economic life of much of the region. When city and town began to materialize
  in the 19th and 20th centuries, they tended to follow the Midwestern model in layout.Although
  quite limited in geographic area, the characteristic villages of the Mormon and
  Hispanic-American districts are of considerable interest. The Mormon settlement
  uncompromisingly followed the ecclesiastically imposed grid plan composed of square
  blocks, each with perhaps only four very large house lots, and the block surrounded
  by extremely wide streets. Those villages in New Mexico in which population and
  culture were derived from Old Mexico were often built according to the standard
  Latin-American plan. The distinctive feature is a central plaza dominated by a Roman
  Catholic church and encircled by low stone or adobe buildings.The United States
  has had little success in achieving or maintaining the ideal of the family farm.
  Through purchase, inheritance, leasing, and other means, some of dubious legality,
  smaller properties have been merged into much larger entities. By the late 1980s,
  for example, when the average farm size had surpassed 460 acres, farms containing
  2,000 or more acres accounted for almost half of all farmland and 20 percent of
  the cropland harvested, even though they comprised less than 3 percent of all farms.
  At the other extreme were those 60 percent of all farms that contained fewer than
  180 acres and reported less than 15 percent of cropland harvested. This trend toward
  fewer but larger farms has continued.The huge, heavily capitalized “neoplantation,”
  essentially a factory in the field, is especially conspicuous in parts of California,
  Arizona, and the Mississippi Delta, but examples can be found in any state. There
  are also many smaller but intensive operations that call for large investments and
  advanced managerial skills. This trend toward large-scale, capital-intensive farm
  enterprise has been paralleled by a sharp drop in rural farm population—a slump
  from the all-time high of some 32,000,000 in the early 20th century to about 5,000,000
  in the late 1980s; but even in 1940, when farm folk still numbered more than 30,000,000,
  nearly 40 percent of farm operators were tenants, and another 10 percent were only
  partial owners.As the agrarian population has dwindled, so too has its immediate
  impact lessened, though less swiftly, in economic and political matters. The rural
  United States, however, has been the source of many of the nation’s values and images.
  The United States has become a highly urbanized, technologically advanced society
  far removed in daily life from cracker barrel, barnyard, corral, or logging camp.
  Although Americans have gravitated, sometimes reluctantly, to the big city, in the
  daydreams and assumptions that guide many sociopolitical decisions, the memory of
  a rapidly vanishing agrarian America is well noted. This is revealed not only in
  the works of contemporary novelists, poets, and painters but also throughout the
  popular arts: in movies, television, soap operas, folklore, country music, political
  oratory, and in much leisure activity.Since about 1920 more genuine change has occurred
  in American rural life than during the preceding three centuries of European settlement
  in North America. Although the basic explanation is the profound social and technological
  transformations engulfing most of the world, the most immediate agent of change
  has been the internal-combustion engine. The automobile, truck, bus, and paved highway
  have more than supplanted a moribund passenger and freight railroad system. While
  many local rail depots have been boarded up and scores of secondary lines have been
  abandoned, hundreds of thousands of miles of old dirt roads have been paved, and
  a vast system of interstate highways has been constructed to connect major cities
  in a single nonstop network. The net result has been a shrinking of travel time
  and an increase in miles traveled for the individual driver, rural or urban.Small
  towns in the United States have undergone a number of changes. Before 1970 towns
  near highways and urban centres generally prospered; while in the less-fortunate
  towns, where the residents lingered on for the sake of relatively cheap housing,
  downtown businesses often became extinct. From the late 1960s until about 1981 the
  rural and small-town population grew at a faster rate than the metropolitan population,
  the so-called metro–nonmetro turnaround, thus reversing more than a century of relatively
  greater urban growth. Subsequent evidence, however, suggests an approach toward
  equilibrium between the urban and rural sectors.As Americans have become increasingly
  mobile, the visual aspect of rural America has altered drastically. The highway
  has become the central route, and many of the functions once confined to the local
  town or city now stretch for many miles along major roads.The metropolitanization
  of life in the United States has not been limited to city, suburb, or exurb; it
  now involves most of the rural area and population. The result has been the decline
  of local crafts and regional peculiarities, quite visibly in such items as farm
  implements, fencing, silos, and housing and in commodities such as clothing or bread.
  In many ways, the countryside is now economically dependent on the city.The city
  dweller is the dominant consumer for products other than those of field, quarry,
  or lumber mill; and city location tends to determine patterns of rural economy rather
  than the reverse. During weekends and the vacation seasons, swarms of city folk
  stream out to second homes in the countryside and to campgrounds, ski runs, beaches,
  boating areas, or hunting and fishing tracts. For many large rural areas, recreation
  is the principal source of income and employment; and such areas as northern New
  England and upstate New York have become playgrounds and sylvan refuges for many
  urban residents.The larger cities reach far into the countryside for their vital
  supplies of water and energy. There is an increasing reliance upon distant coalfields
  to provide fuel for electrical power plants, and cities have gone far afield in
  seeking out rural disposal sites for their ever-growing volumes of garbage.The majority
  of the rural population now lives within daily commuting range of a sizable city.
  This enables many farm residents to operate their farms while, at the same time,
  working part- or full-time at a city job, and it thus helps to prevent the drastic
  decline in rural population that has occurred in remoter parts of the country. Similarly,
  many small towns within the shadow of a metropolis, with fewer and fewer farmers
  to service, have become dormitory satellites, serving residents from nearby cities
  and suburbs.Northeast USA: History and PeopleEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The United
  States has moved from a predominantly rural settlement into an urban society. In
  so doing, it has followed the general path that other advanced nations have traveled
  and one along which developing nations have begun to hasten. About three-fourths
  of the population live clustered within officially designated urban places and urbanized
  areas, which account for less than 2 percent of the national territory. At least
  another 15 percent live in dispersed residences that are actually urban in economic
  or social orientation.Although more than 95 percent of the population was rural
  during the colonial period and for the first years of independence, cities were
  crucial elements in the settlement system from the earliest days. Boston; New Amsterdam
  (New York City); Jamestown, Va.; Charleston, S.C.; and Philadelphia were founded
  at the same time as the colonies they served. Like nearly all other North American
  colonial towns of consequence, they were ocean ports. Until at least the beginning
  of the 20th century the historical geography of U.S. cities was intimately related
  with that of successive transportation systems. The location of successful cities
  with respect to the areas they served, as well as their internal structure, was
  determined largely by the nature of these systems.The colonial cities acted as funnels
  for the collection and shipment of farm and forest products and other raw materials
  from the interior to trading partners in Europe, the Caribbean, or Africa and for
  the return flow of manufactured goods and other locally scarce items, as well as
  immigrants. Such cities were essentially marts and warehouses, and only minimal
  attention was given to social, military, educational, or religious functions. The
  inadequacy and high cost of overland traffic dictated sites along major ocean embayments
  or river estuaries; the only pre-1800 nonports worthy of notice were Lancaster and
  York, both in Pennsylvania, and Williamsburg, Va. With the populating of the interior
  and the spread of a system of canals and improved roads, such new cities as Pittsburgh,
  Pa.; Cincinnati, Ohio; Buffalo, N.Y.; and St. Louis, Mo., mushroomed at junctures
  between various routes or at which modes of transport were changed. Older ocean
  ports, such as New Castle, Del.; Newport, R.I.; Charleston, S.C.; Savannah, Ga.;
  and Portland, Maine, whose locations prevented them from serving large hinterlands,
  tended to stagnate.From about 1850 to 1920 the success of new cities and the further
  growth of older ones in large part were dependent on their location within the new
  steam railroad system and on their ability to dominate a large tributary territory.
  Such waterside rail hubs as Buffalo; Toledo, Ohio; Chicago; and San Francisco gained
  population and wealth rapidly, while such offspring of the rail era as Atlanta,
  Ga.; Indianapolis, Ind.; Minneapolis, Minn.; Fort Worth, Texas; and Tacoma, Wash.,
  also grew dramatically. Much of the rapid industrialization of the 19th and early
  20th centuries occurred in places already favoured by water or rail transport systems;
  but in some instances, such as in the cities of northeastern Pennsylvania’s anthracite
  region, some New England mill towns, and the textile centres of the Carolina and
  Virginia Piedmont, manufacturing brought about rapid urbanization and the consequent
  attraction of transport facilities. The extraction of gold, silver, copper, coal,
  iron, and, in the 20th century, gas and oil led to rather ephemeral centres—unless
  these places were able to capitalize on local or regional advantages other than
  minerals.A strong early start, whatever the inital economic base may have been,
  was often the key factor in competition among cities. With sufficient early momentum,
  urban capital and population tended to expand almost automatically. The point is
  illustrated perfectly by the larger cities of the northeastern seaboard, from Portland,
  Maine, through Baltimore, Md. The nearby physical wealth is poor to mediocre, and
  they are now far off-centre on the national map; but a prosperous mercantile beginning,
  good land and sea connections with distant places, and a rich local accumulation
  of talent, capital, and initiative were sufficient to bring about the growth of
  one of the world’s largest concentrations of industry, commerce, and people.The
  pre-1900 development of the American city was almost completely a chronicle of the
  economics of the production, collection, and distribution of physical commodities
  and basic services dictated by geography, but there have been striking deviations
  from this pattern. The physical determinants of urban location and growth have given
  way to social factors. Increasingly, the most successful cities are oriented toward
  the more advanced modes for the production and consumption of services, specifically
  the knowledge, managerial, and recreational industries. The largest cities have
  become more dependent upon corporate headquarters, communications, and the manipulation
  of information for their sustenance. Washington, D.C., is the most obvious example
  of a metropolis in which government and ancillary activities have been the spur
  for vigorous growth; but almost all of the state capitals have displayed a similar
  demographic and economic vitality. Further, urban centres that contain a major college
  or university often have enjoyed remarkable expansion.With the coming of relative
  affluence and abundant leisure to the population and a decrease of labour input
  in industrial processes, a new breed of cities has sprouted across the land: those
  that cater to the pleasure-seeker, vacationer, and the retired—for example, the
  young, flourishing cities of Florida or Nevada and many locations in California,
  Arizona, and Colorado.The automobile as a means of personal transportation was developed
  about the time of World War I, and the American city was catapulted into a radically
  new period, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the further evolution of physical
  form and function. The size, density, and internal structure of the city were previously
  constrained by the limitations of the pedestrian and early mass-transit systems.
  Only the well-to-do could afford horse and carriage or a secluded villa in the countryside.
  Cities were relatively small and compact, with a single clearly defined centre,
  and they grew by accretion along their edges, without any significant spatial hiatuses
  except where commuter railroads linked outlying towns to the largest of metropolises.
  Workers living beyond the immediate vicinity of their work had to locate within
  reach of the few horse-drawn omnibuses or the later electric street railways.The
  universality of the automobile, even among the less affluent, and the parallel proliferation
  of service facilities and highways greatly loosened and fragmented the American
  city, which spread over surrounding rural lands. Older, formerly autonomous towns
  grew swiftly. Many towns became satellites of the larger city or were absorbed.
  Many suburbs and subdivisions arose with single-family homes on lots larger than
  had been possible for the ordinary householder in the city. These communities were
  almost totally dependent on the highway for the flow of commuters, goods, and services,
  and many were located in splendid isolation, separated by tracts of farmland, brush,
  or forest from other such developments. At the major interchanges of the limited-access
  highways, a new form of agglomerated settlement sprang up. In a further elaboration
  of this trend, many larger cities have been girdled by a set of mushrooming complexes.
  These creations of private enterprise embody a novel concept of urban existence:
  a metropolitan module no longer reliant on the central city or its downtown. Usually
  anchored on a cluster of shopping malls and office parks, these “hypersuburbs,”
  whose residents and employees circulate freely within the outer metropolitan ring,
  offer virtually all of the social and economic facilities needed for the modern
  life-style.The outcome has been a broad, ragged, semiurbanized belt of land surrounding
  each city, large or small, and quite often blending imperceptibly into the suburban-exurban
  halo encircling a neighbouring metropolitan centre. There is a great similarity
  in the makeup and general appearance of all such tracts: the planless intermixture
  of scraps of the rural landscape with the fragments of the scattered metropolis;
  the randomly distributed subdivisions or single homes; the vast shopping centres,
  the large commercial cemeteries, drive-in theatres, junkyards, and golf courses
  and other recreational enterprises; and the regional or metropolitan airport, often
  with its own cluster of factories, warehouses, or travel-oriented businesses. The
  traditional city—unitary, concentric in form, with a single well-defined middle—has
  been replaced by a relatively amorphous, polycentric metropolitan sprawl.The inner
  city of a large U.S. metropolitan area displays some traits that are common to the
  larger centres of all advanced nations. A central business district, almost always
  the oldest section of the city, is surrounded by a succession of roughly circular
  zones, each distinctive in economic and social-ethnic character. The symmetry of
  this scheme is distorted by the irregularities of surface and drainage or the effects
  of radial highways and railroads. Land is most costly, and hence land use is most
  intensive, toward the centre. Major business, financial and governmental offices,
  department stores, and specialty shops dominate the downtown, which is usually fringed
  by a band of factories and warehouses. The outer parts of the city, like the suburbs,
  are mainly residential.With some exceptions—e.g., large apartment complexes in downtown
  Chicago—people do not reside in the downtown areas, and there is a steady downward
  gradient in population density per unit area (and more open land and single-family
  residences) as one moves from the inner city toward the open country. Conversely,
  there is a general rise in income and social status with increasing distance from
  the core. The sharply defined immigrant neighbourhoods of the 19th century generally
  persist in a somewhat diluted form, though specific ethnic groups may have shifted
  their location. Later migrant groups, notably Southern blacks and Latin Americans,
  generally dominate the more run-down neighbourhoods of the inner cities.American
  cities, more so than the small-town or agrarian landscape, tend to be the product
  of a particular period rather than of location. The relatively venerable centres
  of the Eastern Seaboard—Boston; Philadelphia; Baltimore, Md.; Albany, N.Y.; Chester,
  Pa.; Alexandria, Va.; or Georgetown (a district of Washington, D.C.), for example—are
  virtual replicas of the fashionable European models of their early period rather
  than the fruition of a regional culture, unlike New Orleans and Santa Fe, N.M.,
  which reflect other times and regions. The townscapes of Pittsburgh; Detroit, Mich.;
  Chicago; and Denver, Colo., depict national modes of thought and the technological
  development of their formative years, just as Dallas, Texas; Las Vegas, Nev.; San
  Diego, Calif.; Tucson, Ariz.; and Albuquerque, N.M., proclaim contemporary values
  and gadgetry more than any local distinctiveness. When strong-minded city founders
  instituted a highly individual plan and their successors managed to preserve it—as,
  for example, in Savannah, Ga.; Washington, D.C.; and Salt Lake City, Utah—or when
  there is a happy combination of a spectacular site and appreciative residents—as
  in San Francisco or Seattle, Wash.—a genuine individuality does seem to emerge.
  Such an identity also may develop where immigration has been highly selective, as
  in such places as Miami, Fla.; Phoenix, Ariz.; and Los Angeles.As a group, U.S.
  cities differ from cities in other countries in both type and degree. The national
  political structure, the social inclinations of the people, and the strong outward
  surge of urban development have led to the political fragmentation of metropolises
  that socially and economically are relatively cohesive units. The fact that a single
  metropolitan area may sprawl across numerous incorporated towns and cities, several
  townships, and two or more counties and states has a major impact upon both its
  appearance and the way it functions. Not the least of these effects is a dearth
  of overall physical and social planning (or its ineffectuality when attempted),
  and the rather chaotic, inharmonious appearance of both inner-city and peripheral
  zones painfully reflects the absence of any effective collective action concerning
  such matters.The American city is a place of sharp transitions. Construction, demolition,
  and reconstruction go on almost ceaselessly, though increasing thought has been
  given to preserving monuments and buildings. From present evidence, it would be
  impossible to guess that New York City and Albany date from the 1620s or that Detroit
  was founded in 1701. Preservation and restoration do occur, but often only when
  it makes sense in terms of tourist revenue. Physical and social blight has reached
  epidemic proportions in the slum areas of the inner city; but, despite the wholesale
  razing of such areas and the subsequent urban-renewal projects (sometimes as apartment
  or commercial developments for the affluent), the belief has become widespread that
  the ills of the U.S. city are incurable, especially with the increasing flight of
  capital, tax revenue, and the more highly educated, affluent elements of the population
  to suburban areas and the spatial and political polarization of whites and nonwhites.In
  the central sections of U.S. cities, there is little sense of history or continuity;
  instead, one finds evidence of the dominance of the engineering mentality and of
  the credo that the business of the city is business. Commercial and administrative
  activities are paramount, and usually there is little room for church buildings
  or for parks or other nonprofit enterprises. The role of the cathedral, so central
  in the medieval European city, is filled by a U.S. invention serving both utilitarian
  and symbolic purposes, the skyscraper. Some cities have felt the need for other
  bold secular monuments; hence the Gateway Arch looming over St. Louis, Seattle’s
  Space Needle, and Houston’s Astrodome. Future archaeologists may well conclude from
  their excavations that American society was ruled by an oligarchy of highway engineers,
  architects, and bulldozer operators. The great expressways converging upon, or looping,
  the downtown area and the huge amount of space devoted to parking lots and garages
  are even more impressive than the massive surgery executed upon U.S. cities a century
  ago to hack out room for railroad terminals and marshaling yards.Within many urban
  sites there has been radical physical transformation of shoreline, drainage systems,
  and land surface that would be difficult to match elsewhere in the world. Thus,
  in their physical lineaments, Manhattan and inner Boston bear scant resemblance
  to the landscapes seen by their initial settlers. The surface of downtown Chicago
  has been raised several feet above its former swamp level, the city’s lakefront
  extensively reshaped, and the flow of the Chicago River reversed. Los Angeles, notorious
  for its disregard of the environment, has its concrete arroyo bottoms, terraced
  hillsides and landslides, and its own artificial microclimate.The unprecedented
  outward sprawl of American urban settlement has created some novel settlement forms,
  for the quantitative change has been so great as to induce qualitative transformation.
  The conurbation—a territorial coalescence of two or more sizable cities whose peripheral
  zones have grown together—may have first appeared in early 19th-century Europe.
  There are major examples in Great Britain, the Low Countries, and Germany, as well
  as in Japan.Nothing elsewhere, however, rivals in size and complexity the aptly
  named megalopolis, that supercity stretching along the Atlantic from Portland, Maine,
  past Richmond, Va. Other large conurbations include, in the Great Lakes region,
  one centred on Chicago and containing large slices of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Indiana;
  another based in Detroit, embracing large parts of Michigan and Ohio and reaching
  into Canada; and a third stretching from Buffalo through Cleveland and back to Pittsburgh.
  All three are reaching toward one another and may form another megalopolis that,
  in turn, may soon be grafted onto the seaboard megalopolis by a corridor through
  central New York state.Another example of a growing megalopolis is the huge southern
  California conurbation reaching from Santa Barbara, through a dominating Los Angeles,
  to the Mexican border. The solid strip of urban territory that lines the eastern
  shore of Puget Sound is a smaller counterpart. Quite exceptional in form is the
  slender linear multicity occupying Florida’s Atlantic coastline, from Jacksonville
  to Miami, and the loose swarm of medium-sized cities clustering along the Southern
  Piedmont, from south-central Virginia to Birmingham, Ala.; also of note are the
  Texas cities of Dallas–Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio, which have formed a
  rapidly growing—though discontinuous—urbanized triangle.One of the few predictions
  that seem safe in so dynamic and innovative a land as the United States is that,
  unless severe and painful controls are placed on land use, the shape of the urban
  environment will be increasingly megalopolitan: a small set of great constellations
  of polycentric urban zones, each complexly interlocked socially and physically with
  its neighbours.The differences among America’s traditional regions, or culture areas,
  tend to be slight and shallow as compared with such areas in most older, more stable
  countries. The muted, often subtle nature of interregional differences can be ascribed
  to the relative newness of American settlement, a perpetually high degree of mobility,
  a superb communications system, and the galloping centralization of economy and
  government. It might even be argued that some of these regions are quaint vestiges
  of a vanishing past, of interest only to antiquarians.Yet, in spite of the nationwide
  standardization in many areas of American thought and behaviour, the lingering effects
  of the older culture areas do remain potent. In the case of the South, for example,
  the differences helped to precipitate the gravest political crisis and bloodiest
  military conflict in the nation’s history. More than a century after the Civil War,
  the South remains a powerful entity in political, economic, and social terms, and
  its peculiar status is recognized in religious, educational, athletic, and literary
  circles.Even more intriguing is the appearance of a series of essentially 20th-century
  regions. Southern California is the largest and perhaps the most distinctive region,
  and its special culture has attracted large numbers of immigrants to the state.
  Similar trends are visible in southern Florida; in Texas, whose mystique has captured
  the national imagination; and to a certain degree in the more ebullient regions
  of New Mexico and Arizona as well. At the metropolitan level, it is difficult to
  believe that such distinctive cities as San Francisco, Las Vegas, Dallas, Tucson,
  and Seattle have become like all other American cities. A detailed examination,
  however, would show significant if sometimes subtle interregional differences in
  terms of language, religion, diet, folklore, folk architecture and handicrafts,
  political behaviour, social etiquette, and a number of other cultural categories.A
  multitiered hierarchy of culture areas might be postulated for the United States;
  but the most interesting levels are, first, the nation as a whole and, second, the
  five to 10 large subnational regions, each embracing several states or major portions
  thereof. There is a remarkably close coincidence between the political United States
  and the cultural United States. Crossing into Mexico, the traveler passes across
  a cultural chasm. If the contrasts are less dramatic between the two sides of the
  U.S.-Canadian boundary, they are nonetheless real, especially to the Canadian. Erosion
  of the cultural barrier has been largely limited to the area that stretches from
  northern New York state to Aroostook county, Maine. There, a vigorous demographic
  and cultural immigration by French-Canadians has gone far toward eradicating international
  differences.While the international boundaries act as a cultural container, the
  interstate boundaries are curiously irrelevant. Even when the state had a strong
  autonomous early existence—as happened with Massachusetts, Virginia, or Pennsylvania—subsequent
  economic and political forces have tended to wash away such initial identities.
  Actually, it could be argued that the political divisions of the 48 coterminous
  states are anachronistic in the context of contemporary socioeconomic and cultural
  forces. Partially convincing cases might be built for equating Utah and Texas with
  their respective culture areas because of exceptional historical and physical circumstances,
  or perhaps Oklahoma, given its very late European occupation and its dubious distinction
  as the territory to which exiled Indian tribes of the East were relegated. In most
  instances, however, the states either contain two or more distinctly different culture
  and political areas or fragments thereof or are part of a much larger single culture
  area. Thus sharp North–South dichotomies characterize California, Missouri, Illinois,
  Indiana, Ohio, and Florida, while Tennessee advertises that there are really three
  Tennessees. In Virginia the opposing cultural forces were so strong that actual
  fission took place in 1863 (with the admission to the Union of West Virginia) along
  one of those rare interstate boundaries that approximate a genuine cultural divide.Much
  remains to be learned about the cause and effect relations between economic and
  culture areas in the United States. If the South or New England could at one time
  be correlated with a specific economic system, this is no longer easy to do. Cultural
  systems appear to respond more slowly to agents of change than do economic or urban
  systems. Thus the Manufacturing Belt, a core region for many social and economic
  activities, now spans parts of four traditional culture areas—New England, the Midland,
  the Midwest, and the northern fringes of the South. The great urban sprawl, from
  southern Maine to central Virginia, blithely ignores the cultural slopes that are
  still visible in its more rural tracts.The culture areas of the United States are
  generally European in origin, the result of importing European colonists and ways
  of life and the subsequent adaptation of social groups to new habitats. The aboriginal
  cultures have had relatively little influence on the nation’s modern culture. In
  the Southwestern and the indistinct Oklahoman subregions, the Indian element merits
  consideration only as one of several ingredients making up the regional mosaic.
  With some exceptions, the map of American culture areas in the East can be explained
  in terms of the genesis, development, and expansion of the three principal colonial
  cultural hearths along the Atlantic seaboard. Each was basically British in character,
  but their personalities remain distinct because of, first, different sets of social
  and political conditions during the critical period of first effective settlement
  and, second, local physical and economic circumstances. The cultural gradients between
  them tend to be much steeper and the boundaries more distinct than is true for the
  remainder of the nation.United States: New EnglandEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.New
  England was the dominant region during the century of rapid expansion following
  the American Revolution and not merely in terms of demographic or economic expansion.
  In social and cultural life—in education, politics, theology, literature, science,
  architecture, and the more advanced forms of mechanical and social technology—the
  area exercised its primacy. New England was the leading source of ideas and styles
  for the nation from about 1780 to 1880; it furnishes an impressive example of the
  capacity of strongly motivated communities to rise above the constraints of a harsh
  environment.During its first two centuries, New England had an unusually homogeneous
  population. With some exceptions, the British immigrants shared the same nonconformist
  religious beliefs, language, social organization, and general outlook. A distinctive
  regional culture took form, most noticeably in terms of dialect, town morphology,
  and folk architecture. The personality of the people also took on a regional coloration
  both in folklore and in actuality; there is sound basis for the belief that the
  traditional New England Yankee is self-reliant, thrifty, inventive, and enterprising.
  The influx of immigrants that began in the 1830s diluted and altered the New England
  identity, but much of its early personality survived.By virtue of location, wealth,
  and seniority, the Boston metropolitan area has become the cultural economic centre
  of New England. This sovereignty is shared to some degree, however, with two other
  old centres, the lower Connecticut Valley and the Narragansett Bay region of Rhode
  Island.The early westward demographic and ideological expansion of New England was
  so influential that it is justifiable to call New York, northern New Jersey, northern
  Pennsylvania, and much of the Upper Midwest “New England Extended.” Further, the
  energetic endeavours of New England whalers, merchants, and missionaries had a considerable
  impact on the cultures of Hawaii, various other Pacific isles, and several points
  in the Caribbean. New Englanders also were active in the Americanization of early
  Oregon and Washington, with results that are still visible. Later, the overland
  diffusion of New England natives and practices meant a recognizable New England
  character not only for the Upper Midwest, from Ohio to the Dakotas, but also in
  the Pacific Northwest in general, though to a lesser degree.United States: The Upper
  SouthEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.By far the largest of the three original Anglo-American
  culture areas, the South is also the most idiosyncratic with respect to national
  norms—or slowest to accept them. The South was once so distinct from the non-South
  in almost every observable or quantifiable feature and so fiercely proud of its
  peculiarities that for some years the question of whether it could maintain political
  and social unity with the non-South was in serious doubt. These differences are
  still observable in almost every realm of human activity, including rural economy,
  dialect, diet, costume, folklore, politics, architecture, social customs, and recreation.
  Only during the 20th century can an argument be made that it has achieved a decisive
  convergence with the rest of the nation, at least in terms of economic behaviour
  and material culture.A persistent deviation from the national mainstream probably
  began in the first years of settlement. The first settlers of the South were almost
  purely British, not outwardly different from those who flocked to New England or
  the Midland, but almost certainly distinct in terms of motives and social values
  and more conservative in retaining the rurality and the family and social structure
  of premodern Europe. The vast importation of African slaves was also a major factor,
  as was a degree of contact with the Indians that was less pronounced farther north.
  In addition, the unusual pattern of economy (much different from that of northwestern
  Europe), settlement, and social organization, which were in part an adaptation to
  a starkly unfamiliar physical habitat, accentuated the South’s deviation from other
  culture areas.In both origin and spatial structure, the South has been characterized
  by diffuseness. In the search for a single cultural hearth, the most plausible choice
  is the Chesapeake Bay area and the northeastern corner of North Carolina, the earliest
  area of recognizably Southern character. Early components of Southern population
  and culture also arrived from other sources. A narrow coastal strip from North Carolina
  to the Georgia–Florida border and including the Sea Islands is decidedly Southern
  in character, yet it stands apart self-consciously from other parts of the South.
  Though colonized directly from Great Britain, it had also significant connections
  with the West Indies, in which relation the African cultural contribution was strongest
  and purest. Charleston and Savannah, which nurtured their own distinctive civilizations,
  dominated this subregion. Similarly, French Louisiana received elements of culture
  and population—to be stirred into the special Creole mixture—not only, putatively,
  from the Chesapeake Bay hearth area but also indirectly from France, French Nova
  Scotia, the French West Indies, and Africa. In south central Texas, the Germanic
  and Hispanic influx was so heavy that a special subregion can be designated.It would
  seem, then, that the Southern culture area may be an example of convergent, or parallel,
  evolution of a variety of elements arriving along several paths but subject to some
  single general process that could mold one larger regional consciousness and way
  of life.Because of its slowness in joining the national technological mainstream,
  the South can be subdivided into a much greater number of subregions than is possible
  for any of the other older traditional regions. Those described above are of lesser
  order than the two principal Souths, variously called Upper and Lower (or Deep)
  South, Upland and Lowland South, or Yeoman and Plantation South.The Upland South,
  which comprises the southern Appalachians, the upper Appalachian Piedmont, the Cumberland
  and other low interior plateaus, and the Ozarks and Ouachitas, was colonized culturally
  and demographically from the Chesapeake Bay hearth area and the Midland; it is most
  emphatically white Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) in character. The latter area,
  which contains a large black population, includes the greater part of the South
  Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains and the lower Appalachian Piedmont. Its early major
  influences came from the Chesapeake Bay area, with only minor elements from the
  coastal Carolina–Georgia belt, Louisiana, and elsewhere. The division between the
  two subregions remains distinct from Virginia to Texas, but each region can be further
  subdivided. Within the Upland South, the Ozark region might legitimately be detached
  from the Appalachian; and, within the latter, the proud and prosperous Kentucky
  Bluegrass, with its emphasis on tobacco and Thoroughbreds, certainly merits special
  recognition.Toward the margins of the South, the difficulties in delimiting subregions
  become greater. The outer limits themselves are a topic of special interest. There
  seems to be more than an accidental relation between these limits and various climatic
  factors. The fuzzy northern boundary, definitely not associated with the conventional
  Mason and Dixon Line or the Ohio River, seems most closely associated with length
  of frost-free season or with temperature during the winter. As the Southern cultural
  complex was carried to the West, it not only retained its strength but became more
  intense, in contrast to the influence of New England and the Midland. But the South
  finally fades away as one approaches the 100th meridian, with its critical decline
  in annual precipitation. The apparent correlation between the cultural South and
  a humid subtropical climatic regime is in many ways valid.The Texas subregion is
  so large, distinctive, vigorous, and self-assertive that it presents some vexing
  classificatory questions. Is Texas simply a subregion of the Greater South, or has
  it acquired so strong and divergent an identity that it can be regarded as a major
  region in its own right? It is likely that a major region has been born in a frontier
  zone in which several distinct cultural communities confront one another and in
  which the mixture has bred the vigorous, extroverted, aggressive Texas personality
  so widely celebrated in song and story. Similarly, peninsular Florida may be considered
  either within or juxtaposed to the South but not necessarily part of it. In the
  case of Florida, an almost empty territory began to receive significant settlement
  only after about 1890, and if, like Texas, most of it came from the older South,
  there were also vigorous infusions from elsewhere.United States: Middle Atlantic
  regionEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The significance of this region has not been
  less than that of New England or the South, but its characteristics are the least
  conspicuous to outsiders as well as to its own residents—reflecting, perhaps, its
  centrality in the course of U.S. development. The Midland (a term not to be confused
  with Midwest) comprises portions of Middle Atlantic and Upper Southern states: Pennsylvania,
  New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland. Serious European settlement of the Midland began
  a generation or more after that of the other major cultural centres and after several
  earlier, relatively ineffectual trials by the Dutch, Swedes, Finns, and British.
  But once begun late in the 17th century by William Penn and his associates, the
  colonization of the area was a success. Within southeastern Pennsylvania this culture
  area first assumed its distinctive character: a prosperous, sober, industrious agricultural
  society that quickly became a mixed economy as mercantile and later industrial functions
  came to the fore. By the mid-18th century much of the region had acquired a markedly
  urban character, resembling in many ways the more advanced portions of the North
  Sea countries. In this respect, at least, the Midland was well ahead of neighbouring
  areas to the north and south.It differed also in its polyglot ethnicity. From almost
  the beginning, the various ethnic and religious groups of the British Isles were
  joined by immigrants from the European mainland. This diversity has grown and is
  likely to continue. The mosaic of colonial ethnic groups has persisted in much of
  Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and Maryland, as has the remarkable variety
  of nationalities and churches in coalfields, company towns, cities, and many rural
  areas. Much of the same ethnic heterogeneity can be seen in New England, the Midwest,
  and a few other areas, but the Midland stands out as perhaps the most polyglot region
  of the nation. The Germanic element has always been notably strong, if irregularly
  distributed, in the Midland, accounting for more than 70 percent of the population
  of many towns. Had the Anglo-American culture not triumphed, the area might well
  have been designated Pennsylvania German.Physiography and migration carried the
  Midland culture area into the Maryland Piedmont. Although its width tapers quickly
  below the Potomac, it reaches into parts of Virginia and West Virginia, with traces
  legible far down the Appalachian zone and into the South.The northern half of the
  greater Midland region (the New York subregion, or New England Extended) cannot
  be assigned unequivocally to either New England or this Midland. Essentially it
  is a hybrid formed mainly from two regional strains of almost equal strength: New
  England and the post-1660 British element moving up the Hudson valley and beyond.
  There has also been a persistent, if slight, residue of early Dutch culture and
  some subtle filtering northward of Pennsylvanian influences. Apparently within the
  New York subregion occurred the first major fusion of American regional cultures,
  especially within the early 19th-century “Burned-Over District,” around the Finger
  Lakes and Genesee areas of central and western New York. This locality, the seedbed
  for a number of important social innovations, was a major staging area for westward
  migration and possibly a major source for the people and notions that were to build
  the Midwestern culture area.Toward the west the Midland retains its integrity for
  only a short distance—certainly no further than eastern Ohio—as it becomes submerged
  within the Midwest. Still, its significance in the genesis of the Midwest and the
  national culture should not be minimized. Its success in projecting its image upon
  so much of the country may have drawn attention away from the source area. As both
  name and location suggest, the Midland is intermediate in character in many respects,
  lying between New England and the South. Its residents are much less concerned with,
  or conscious of, a strong regional identity (excepting the Pennsylvania Dutch caricatures)
  than is true for the other regions, and, in addition, the Midland lacks their strong
  political and literary traditions, though it is unmistakable in its distinctive
  townscapes and farmsteads.United States: The MidwestEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.
  There is no such self-effacement in the Midwest, that large triangular region justly
  regarded as the most nearly representative of the national average. Everyone within
  or outside of the Midwest knows of its existence, but no one is certain where it
  begins or ends. The older apex of the eastward-pointing triangle appears to rest
  around Pittsburgh, while the two western corners melt away somewhere in the Great
  Plains, possibly in southern Manitoba in the north and southern Kansas in the south.
  The eastern terminus and the southern and western borders are broad, indistinct
  transitional zones.Serious study of the historical geography of the Midwest began
  only in the 20th century, but it seems likely that this culture region was the combination
  of all three colonial regions and that this combination first took place in the
  upper Ohio valley. The early routes of travel—the Ohio and its tributaries, the
  Great Lakes, and the low, level corridor along the Mohawk and the coastal plains
  of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie—converge upon Ohio. There, the people and cultural
  traits from New England, the Midland, and the South were first funneled together.
  There seems to have been a fanlike widening of the new hybrid area into the West
  as settlers worked their way frontierward.Two major subregions are readily discerned,
  the Upper and Lower Midwest. They are separated by a line, roughly approximating
  the 41st parallel, that persists as far west as Colorado in terms of speech patterns
  and indicates differences in regional provenance in ethnic and religious terms as
  well. Much of the Upper Midwest retains a faint New England character, although
  Midland influences are probably as important. A rich mixture of German, Scandinavian,
  Slavic, and other non-WASP elements has greatly diversified a stock in which the
  British element usually remains dominant and the range of church denominations is
  great. The Lower Midwest, except for the relative scarcity of blacks, tends to resemble
  the South in its predominantly Protestant and British makeup. There are some areas
  with sizable Roman Catholic and non-WASP populations, but on the whole the subregion
  tends to be more WASP in inclination than most other parts of the nation.Mountain
  Region: History and PeopleEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The foregoing culture areas
  account for roughly the eastern half of the coterminous United States. There is
  a dilemma in classifying the remaining half. The concept of the American West, strong
  in the popular imagination, is reinforced constantly by romanticized cinematic and
  television images of the cowboy. It is facile to accept the widespread Western livestock
  complex as epitomizing the full gamut of Western life, because although the cattle
  industry may have once accounted for more than one-half of the active Western domain
  as measured in acres, it employed only a relatively small fraction of the total
  population. As a single subculture, it cannot represent the total regional culture.It
  is not clear whether there is a genuine, single, grand Western culture region. Unlike
  the East, where virtually all the land is developed and culture areas and subregions
  abut and overlap in splendid confusion, the eight major and many lesser nodes of
  population in the western United States resemble oases, separated from one another
  by wide expanses of nearly unpopulated mountain or arid desert. The only obvious
  properties these isolated clusters have in common are, first, the intermixture of
  several strains of culture, primarily from the East but with additions from Europe,
  Mexico, and East Asia, and, second, except for one subregion, a general modernity,
  having been settled in a serious way no earlier than the 1840s. Some areas may be
  viewed as inchoate, or partially formed, cultural entities; the others have acquired
  definite personalities but are difficult to classify as first-order or lesser order
  culture areas.There are several major tracts in the western United States that reveal
  a genuine cultural identity: the Upper Rio Grande region, the Mormon region, southern
  California, and, by some accounts, northern California. To this group one might
  add the anomalous Texan and Oklahoman subregions, which have elements of both the
  West and the South.United States: The SouthwestEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The
  term Upper Rio Grande region was coined to denote the oldest and strongest of the
  three sectors of Hispanic-American activity in the Southwest, the others being southern
  California and portions of Texas. Although covering the valley of the upper Rio
  Grande, the region also embraces segments of Arizona and Colorado as well as other
  parts of New Mexico. European communities and culture have been present there, with
  only one interruption, since the late 16th century. The initial sources were Spain
  and Mexico, but after 1848 at least three distinct strains of Anglo-American culture
  were increasingly well represented—the Southern, Mormon, and a general undifferentiated
  Northeastern culture—plus a distinct Texan subcategory. For once this has occurred
  without obliterating the Indians, whose culture endures in various stages of dilution,
  from the strongly Americanized or Hispanicized to the almost undisturbed.The general
  mosaic is a fabric of Indian, Anglo, and Hispanic elements, and all three major
  groups, furthermore, are complex in character. The Indian component is made up of
  Navajo, Pueblo, and several smaller groups, each of which is quite distinct from
  the others. The Hispanic element is also diverse—modally Mexican mestizo, but ranging
  from pure Spanish to nearly pure pre-Spanish aboriginal.United States: The northern
  Mountain regionEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The Mormon region is expansive in the
  religious and demographic realms, though it has ceased to expand territorially as
  it did in the decades after the first settlement in the Salt Lake valley in 1847.
  Despite its Great Basin location and an exemplary adaptation to environmental constraints,
  this cultural complex appears somewhat non-Western in spirit: the Mormons may be
  in the West, but they are not entirely of it. Their historical derivation from the
  Midwest and from ultimate sources in New York and New England is still apparent,
  along with the generous admixture of European converts to their religion.As in New
  England, the power of the human will and an intensely cherished abstract design
  have triumphed over an unfriendly habitat. The Mormon way of life is expressed in
  the settlement landscape and economic activities within a region more homogeneous
  internally than any other U.S. culture area.CaliforniaEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.In
  contrast, northern California has yet to gain its own strong cultural coloration.
  From the beginning of the great 1849 gold rush the area drew a diverse population
  from Europe and Asia as well as the older portions of the United States. Whether
  the greater part of northern California has produced a culture amounting to more
  than the sum of the contributions brought by immigrants is questionable. San Francisco,
  the regional metropolis, may have crossed the qualitative threshold. An unusually
  cosmopolitan outlook that includes an awareness of the Orient stronger than that
  of any other U.S. city, a fierce self-esteem, and a unique townscape may be symptomatic
  of a genuinely new, emergent local culture.Southern California is the most spectacular
  of the Western regions, not only in terms of economic and population growth but
  also for the luxuriance, regional particularism, and general avant-garde character
  of its swiftly evolving cultural pattern. Until the coming of a direct transcontinental
  rail connection in 1885, the region was remote, rural, and largely inconsequential.
  Since then, the invasion by persons from virtually every corner of North America
  and by the world has been massive, but since the 1960s in-migration has slackened
  perceptibly, and many residents have begun to question the doctrine of unlimited
  growth. In any event, a loosely articulated series of urban and suburban developments
  continue to encroach upon what little is left of arable or habitable land in the
  Coast Ranges and valleys from Santa Barbara to the Mexican border.Although every
  major ethnic and racial group and every other U.S. culture area is amply represented
  in southern California, there is reason to suspect that a process of selection for
  certain types of people, attitudes, and personality traits may have been at work
  at both source and destination. The region is distinct from, or perhaps in the vanguard
  of, the remainder of the nation. One might view southern California as the super-American
  region or the outpost of a postindustrial future, but its cultural distinctiveness
  is very evident in landscape and social behaviour. Southern California in no way
  approaches being a “traditional region,” or even the smudged facsimile of such,
  but rather the largest, boldest experiment in creating a “voluntary region,” one
  built through the self-selection of immigrants and their subsequent interaction.United
  States: The northern Pacific CoastEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The remaining identifiable
  Western regions—the Willamette valley of Oregon, the Puget Sound region, the Inland
  Empire of eastern Washington and adjacent tracts of Idaho and Oregon, central Arizona,
  and the Colorado Piedmont—can be treated jointly as potential, or emergent, culture
  areas, still too close to the national mean to display any cultural distinctiveness.
  In all of these regions is evident the arrival of a cross section of the national
  population and the growth of regional life around one or more major metropolises.
  A New England element is noteworthy in the Willamette valley and Puget Sound regions,
  while a Hispanic-American component appears in the Colorado Piedmont and central
  Arizona. Only time and further study will reveal whether any of these regions, so
  distant from the historic sources of U.S. population and culture, have the capacity
  to become an independent cultural area.1Excludes 5 nonvoting delegates from the
