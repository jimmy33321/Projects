  It sounds so reasonable, doesn't it? Such a modest proposal. Why not teach "both sides" and let the children decide for themselves? As President Bush said, "You're asking me whether or not people ought to be exposed to different ideas, the answer is yes." At first hearing, everything about the phrase "both sides" warms the hearts of educators like ourselves.
- |
  One of us spent years as an Oxford tutor and it was his habit to choose controversial topics for the students' weekly essays. They were required to go to the library, read about both sides of an argument, give a fair account of both, and then come to a balanced judgment in their essay. The call for balance, by the way, was always tempered by the maxim, "When two opposite points of view are expressed with equal intensity, the truth does not necessarily lie exactly half way between. It is possible for one side simply to be wrong."
- |
  As teachers, both of us have found that asking our students to analyse controversies is of enormous value to their education. What is wrong, then, with teaching both sides of the alleged controversy between evolution and creationism or "intelligent design" (ID)? And, by the way, don't be fooled by the disingenuous euphemism. There is nothing new about ID. It is simply creationism camouflaged with a new name to slip (with some success, thanks to loads of tax-free money and slick public-relations professionals) under the radar of the US Constitution's mandate for separation between church and state.
- |
  Why, then, would two lifelong educators and passionate advocates of the "both sides" style of teaching join with essentially all biologists in making an exception of the alleged controversy between creation and evolution? What is wrong with the apparently sweet reasonableness of "it is only fair to teach both sides"? The answer is simple. This is not a scientific controversy at all. And it is a time-wasting distraction because evolutionary science, perhaps more than any other major science, is bountifully endowed with genuine controversy.
- |
  Among the controversies that students of evolution commonly face, these are genuinely challenging and of great educational value: neutralism versus selectionism in molecular evolution; adaptationism; group selection; punctuated equilibrium; cladism; "evo-devo"; the "Cambrian Explosion"; mass extinctions; interspecies competition; sympatric speciation; sexual selection; the evolution of sex itself; evolutionary psychology; Darwinian medicine and so on. The point is that all these controversies, and many more, provide fodder for fascinating and lively argument, not just in essays but for student discussions late at night.
- |
  Intelligent design is not an argument of the same character as these controversies. It is not a scientific argument at all, but a religious one. It might be worth discussing in a class on the history of ideas, in a philosophy class on popular logical fallacies, or in a comparative religion class on origin myths from around the world. But it no more belongs in a biology class than alchemy belongs in a chemistry class, phlogiston in a physics class or the stork theory in a sex education class. In those cases, the demand for equal time for "both theories" would be ludicrous. Similarly, in a class on 20th-century European history, who would demand equal time for the theory that the Holocaust never happened?
- |
  So, why are we so sure that intelligent design is not a real scientific theory, worthy of "both sides" treatment? Isn't that just our personal opinion? It is an opinion shared by the vast majority of professional biologists, but of course science does not proceed by majority vote among scientists. Why isn't creationism (or its incarnation as intelligent design) just another scientific controversy, as worthy of scientific debate as the dozen essay topics we listed above? Here's why.
- |
  If ID really were a scientific theory, positive evidence for it, gathered through research, would fill peer-reviewed scientific journals. This doesn't happen. It isn't that editors refuse to publish ID research. There simply isn't any ID research to publish. Its advocates bypass normal scientific due process by appealing directly to the non-scientific public and - with great shrewdness - to the government officials they elect.
- |
  The argument the ID advocates put, such as it is, is always of the same character. Never do they offer positive evidence in favour of intelligent design. All we ever get is a list of alleged deficiencies in evolution. We are told of "gaps" in the fossil record. Or organs are stated, by fiat and without supporting evidence, to be "irreducibly complex": too complex to have evolved by natural selection.
- |
  In all cases there is a hidden (actually they scarcely even bother to hide it) "default" assumption that if Theory A has some difficulty in explaining Phenomenon X, we must automatically prefer Theory B without even asking whether Theory B (creationism in this case) is any better at explaining it. Note how unbalanced this is, and how it gives the lie to the apparent reasonableness of "let's teach both sides". One side is required to produce evidence, every step of the way. The other side is never required to produce one iota of evidence, but is deemed to have won automatically, the moment the first side encounters a difficulty - the sort of difficulty that all sciences encounter every day, and go to work to solve, with relish.
- |
  What, after all, is a gap in the fossil record? It is simply the absence of a fossil which would otherwise have documented a particular evolutionary transition. The gap means that we lack a complete cinematic record of every step in the evolutionary process. But how incredibly presumptuous to demand a complete record, given that only a minuscule proportion of deaths result in a fossil anyway.
- |
  The equivalent evidential demand of creationism would be a complete cinematic record of God's behaviour on the day that he went to work on, say, the mammalian ear bones or the bacterial flagellum - the small, hair-like organ that propels mobile bacteria. Not even the most ardent advocate of intelligent design claims that any such divine videotape will ever become available.
- |
  Biologists, on the other hand, can confidently claim the equivalent "cinematic" sequence of fossils for a very large number of evolutionary transitions. Not all, but very many, including our own descent from the bipedal ape Australopithecus. And - far more telling - not a single authentic fossil has ever been found in the "wrong" place in the evolutionary sequence. Such an anachronistic fossil, if one were ever unearthed, would blow evolution out of the water.
- |
  As the great biologist J B S Haldane growled, when asked what might disprove evolution: "Fossil rabbits in the pre-Cambrian." Evolution, like all good theories, makes itself vulnerable to disproof. Needless to say, it has always come through with flying colours.
- |
  Similarly, the claim that something - say the bacterial flagellum - is too complex to have evolved by natural selection is alleged, by a lamentably common but false syllogism, to support the "rival" intelligent design theory by default. This kind of default reasoning leaves completely open the possibility that, if the bacterial flagellum is too complex to have evolved, it might also be too complex to have been created. And indeed, a moment's thought shows that any God capable of creating a bacterial flagellum (to say nothing of a universe) would have to be a far more complex, and therefore statistically improbable, entity than the bacterial flagellum (or universe) itself - even more in need of an explanation than the object he is alleged to have created.
- |
  If complex organisms demand an explanation, so does a complex designer. And it's no solution to raise the theologian's plea that God (or the Intelligent Designer) is simply immune to the normal demands of scientific explanation. To do so would be to shoot yourself in the foot. You cannot have it both ways. Either ID belongs in the science classroom, in which case it must submit to the discipline required of a scientific hypothesis. Or it does not, in which case get it out of the science classroom and send it back into the church, where it belongs.
- |
  In fact, the bacterial flagellum is certainly not too complex to have evolved, nor is any other living structure that has ever been carefully studied. Biologists have located plausible series of intermediates, using ingredients to be found elsewhere in living systems. But even if some particular case were found for which biologists could offer no ready explanation, the important point is that the "default" logic of the creationists remains thoroughly rotten.
- |
  There is no evidence in favour of intelligent design: only alleged gaps in the completeness of the evolutionary account, coupled with the "default" fallacy we have identified. And, while it is inevitably true that there are incompletenesses in evolutionary science, the positive evidence for the fact of evolution is truly massive, made up of hundreds of thousands of mutually corroborating observations. These come from areas such as geology, paleontology, comparative anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, ethology, biogeography, embryology and - increasingly nowadays - molecular genetics.
- |
  The weight of the evidence has become so heavy that opposition to the fact of evolution is laughable to all who are acquainted with even a fraction of the published data. Evolution is a fact: as much a fact as plate tectonics or the heliocentric solar system.
- |
  Why, finally, does it matter whether these issues are discussed in science classes? There is a case for saying that it doesn't - that biologists shouldn't get so hot under the collar. Perhaps we should just accept the popular demand that we teach ID as well as evolution in science classes. It would, after all, take only about 10 minutes to exhaust the case for ID, then we could get back to teaching real science and genuine controversy.
- |
  Tempting as this is, a serious worry remains. The seductive "let's teach the controversy" language still conveys the false, and highly pernicious, idea that there really are two sides. This would distract students from the genuinely important and interesting controversies that enliven evolutionary discourse. Worse, it would hand creationism the only victory it realistically aspires to. Without needing to make a single good point in any argument, it would have won the right for a form of supernaturalism to be recognised as an authentic part of science. And that would be the end of science education in America.

  Arguments worth having ...
- |
  The "Cambrian Explosion"
- |
  Although the fossil record shows that the first multicellular animals lived about 640m years ago, the diversity of species was low until about 530m years ago. At that time there was a sudden explosion of many diverse marine species, including the first appearance of molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms and vertebrates. "Sudden" here is used in the geological sense; the "explosion" occurred over a period of 10m to 30m years, which is, after all, comparable to the time taken to evolve most of the great radiations of mammals. This rapid diversification raises fascinating questions; explanations include the evolution of organisms with hard parts (which aid fossilisation), the evolutionary "discovery" of eyes, and the development of new genes that allowed parts of organisms to evolve independently.
- |
  The evolutionary basis of human behaviour
- |
  The field of evolutionary psychology (once called "sociobiology") maintains that many universal traits of human behaviour (especially sexual behaviour), as well as differences between individuals and between ethnic groups, have a genetic basis. These traits and differences are said to have evolved in our ancestors via natural selection. There is much controversy about these claims, largely because it is hard to reconstruct the evolutionary forces that acted on our ancestors, and it is unethical to do genetic experiments on modern humans.
- |
  Sexual versus natural selection
- |
  Although evolutionists agree that adaptations invariably result from natural selection, there are many traits, such as the elaborate plumage of male birds and size differences between the sexes in many species, that are better explained by "sexual selection": selection based on members of one sex (usually females) preferring to mate with members of the other sex that show certain desirable traits. Evolutionists debate how many features of animals have resulted from sexual as opposed to natural selection; some, like Darwin himself, feel that many physical features differentiating human "races" resulted from sexual selection.
- |
  The target of natural selection
- |
  Evolutionists agree that natural selection usually acts on genes in organisms - individuals carrying genes that give them a reproductive or survival advantage over others will leave more descendants, gradually changing the genetic composition of a species. This is called "individual selection". But some evolutionists have proposed that selection can act at higher levels as well: on populations (group selection), or even on species themselves (species selection). The relative importance of individual versus these higher order forms of selection is a topic of lively debate.
- |
  Natural selection versus genetic drift
- |
  Natural selection is a process that leads to the replacement of one gene by another in a predictable way. But there is also a "random" evolutionary process called genetic drift, which is the genetic equivalent of coin-tossing. Genetic drift leads to unpredictable changes in the frequencies of genes that don't make much difference to the adaptation of their carriers, and can cause evolution by changing the genetic composition of populations. Many features of DNA are said to have evolved by genetic drift. Evolutionary geneticists disagree about the importance of selection versus drift in explaining features of organisms and their DNA. All evolutionists agree that genetic drift can't explain adaptive evolution. But not all evolution is adaptive.

- 'It sounds so reasonable, doesn''t it? Such a modest proposal. Why not teach "both
  sides" and let the children decide for themselves? As President Bush said, "You''re
  asking me whether or not people ought to be exposed to different ideas, the answer
  is yes." At first hearing, everything about the phrase "both sides" warms the hearts
  of educators like ourselves.One of us spent years as an Oxford tutor and it was
  his habit to choose controversial topics for the students'' weekly essays. They
  were required to go to the library, read about both sides of an argument, give a
  fair account of both, and then come to a balanced judgment in their essay. The call
  for balance, by the way, was always tempered by the maxim, "When two opposite points
  of view are expressed with equal intensity, the truth does not necessarily lie exactly
  half way between. It is possible for one side simply to be wrong."As teachers, both
  of us have found that asking our students to analyse controversies is of enormous
  value to their education. What is wrong, then, with teaching both sides of the alleged
  controversy between evolution and creationism or "intelligent design" (ID)? And,
  by the way, don''t be fooled by the disingenuous euphemism. There is nothing new
  about ID. It is simply creationism camouflaged with a new name to slip (with some
  success, thanks to loads of tax-free money and slick public-relations professionals)
  under the radar of the US Constitution''s mandate for separation between church
  and state.Why, then, would two lifelong educators and passionate advocates of the
  "both sides" style of teaching join with essentially all biologists in making an
  exception of the alleged controversy between creation and evolution? What is wrong
  with the apparently sweet reasonableness of "it is only fair to teach both sides"?
  The answer is simple. This is not a scientific controversy at all. And it is a time-wasting
  distraction because evolutionary science, perhaps more than any other major science,
  is bountifully endowed with genuine controversy.Among the controversies that students
  of evolution commonly face, these are genuinely challenging and of great educational
  value: neutralism versus selectionism in molecular evolution; adaptationism; group
  selection; punctuated equilibrium; cladism; "evo-devo"; the "Cambrian Explosion";
  mass extinctions; interspecies competition; sympatric speciation; sexual selection;
  the evolution of sex itself; evolutionary psychology; Darwinian medicine and so
  on. The point is that all these controversies, and many more, provide fodder for
  fascinating and lively argument, not just in essays but for student discussions
  late at night.Intelligent design is not an argument of the same character as these
  controversies. It is not a scientific argument at all, but a religious one. It might
  be worth discussing in a class on the history of ideas, in a philosophy class on
  popular logical fallacies, or in a comparative religion class on origin myths from
  around the world. But it no more belongs in a biology class than alchemy belongs
  in a chemistry class, phlogiston in a physics class or the stork theory in a sex
  education class. In those cases, the demand for equal time for "both theories" would
  be ludicrous. Similarly, in a class on 20th-century European history, who would
  demand equal time for the theory that the Holocaust never happened?So, why are we
  so sure that intelligent design is not a real scientific theory, worthy of "both
  sides" treatment? Isn''t that just our personal opinion? It is an opinion shared
  by the vast majority of professional biologists, but of course science does not
  proceed by majority vote among scientists. Why isn''t creationism (or its incarnation
  as intelligent design) just another scientific controversy, as worthy of scientific
  debate as the dozen essay topics we listed above? Here''s why.If ID really were
  a scientific theory, positive evidence for it, gathered through research, would
  fill peer-reviewed scientific journals. This doesn''t happen. It isn''t that editors
  refuse to publish ID research. There simply isn''t any ID research to publish. Its
  advocates bypass normal scientific due process by appealing directly to the non-scientific
  public and - with great shrewdness - to the government officials they elect.The
  argument the ID advocates put, such as it is, is always of the same character. Never
  do they offer positive evidence in favour of intelligent design. All we ever get
  is a list of alleged deficiencies in evolution. We are told of "gaps" in the fossil
  record. Or organs are stated, by fiat and without supporting evidence, to be "irreducibly
  complex": too complex to have evolved by natural selection.In all cases there is
  a hidden (actually they scarcely even bother to hide it) "default" assumption that
  if Theory A has some difficulty in explaining Phenomenon X, we must automatically
  prefer Theory B without even asking whether Theory B (creationism in this case)
  is any better at explaining it. Note how unbalanced this is, and how it gives the
  lie to the apparent reasonableness of "let''s teach both sides". One side is required
  to produce evidence, every step of the way. The other side is never required to
  produce one iota of evidence, but is deemed to have won automatically, the moment
  the first side encounters a difficulty - the sort of difficulty that all sciences
  encounter every day, and go to work to solve, with relish.What, after all, is a
  gap in the fossil record? It is simply the absence of a fossil which would otherwise
  have documented a particular evolutionary transition. The gap means that we lack
  a complete cinematic record of every step in the evolutionary process. But how incredibly
  presumptuous to demand a complete record, given that only a minuscule proportion
  of deaths result in a fossil anyway.The equivalent evidential demand of creationism
  would be a complete cinematic record of God''s behaviour on the day that he went
  to work on, say, the mammalian ear bones or the bacterial flagellum - the small,
  hair-like organ that propels mobile bacteria. Not even the most ardent advocate
  of intelligent design claims that any such divine videotape will ever become available.Biologists,
  on the other hand, can confidently claim the equivalent "cinematic" sequence of
  fossils for a very large number of evolutionary transitions. Not all, but very many,
  including our own descent from the bipedal ape Australopithecus. And - far more
  telling - not a single authentic fossil has ever been found in the "wrong" place
  in the evolutionary sequence. Such an anachronistic fossil, if one were ever unearthed,
  would blow evolution out of the water.As the great biologist J B S Haldane growled,
  when asked what might disprove evolution: "Fossil rabbits in the pre-Cambrian."
  Evolution, like all good theories, makes itself vulnerable to disproof. Needless
  to say, it has always come through with flying colours.Similarly, the claim that
  something - say the bacterial flagellum - is too complex to have evolved by natural
  selection is alleged, by a lamentably common but false syllogism, to support the
  "rival" intelligent design theory by default. This kind of default reasoning leaves
  completely open the possibility that, if the bacterial flagellum is too complex
  to have evolved, it might also be too complex to have been created. And indeed,
  a moment''s thought shows that any God capable of creating a bacterial flagellum
  (to say nothing of a universe) would have to be a far more complex, and therefore
  statistically improbable, entity than the bacterial flagellum (or universe) itself
  - even more in need of an explanation than the object he is alleged to have created.If
  complex organisms demand an explanation, so does a complex designer. And it''s no
  solution to raise the theologian''s plea that God (or the Intelligent Designer)
  is simply immune to the normal demands of scientific explanation. To do so would
  be to shoot yourself in the foot. You cannot have it both ways. Either ID belongs
  in the science classroom, in which case it must submit to the discipline required
  of a scientific hypothesis. Or it does not, in which case get it out of the science
  classroom and send it back into the church, where it belongs.In fact, the bacterial
  flagellum is certainly not too complex to have evolved, nor is any other living
  structure that has ever been carefully studied. Biologists have located plausible
  series of intermediates, using ingredients to be found elsewhere in living systems.
  But even if some particular case were found for which biologists could offer no
  ready explanation, the important point is that the "default" logic of the creationists
  remains thoroughly rotten.There is no evidence in favour of intelligent design:
  only alleged gaps in the completeness of the evolutionary account, coupled with
  the "default" fallacy we have identified. And, while it is inevitably true that
  there are incompletenesses in evolutionary science, the positive evidence for the
  fact of evolution is truly massive, made up of hundreds of thousands of mutually
  corroborating observations. These come from areas such as geology, paleontology,
  comparative anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, ethology, biogeography, embryology
  and - increasingly nowadays - molecular genetics.The weight of the evidence has
  become so heavy that opposition to the fact of evolution is laughable to all who
  are acquainted with even a fraction of the published data. Evolution is a fact:
  as much a fact as plate tectonics or the heliocentric solar system.Why, finally,
  does it matter whether these issues are discussed in science classes? There is a
  case for saying that it doesn''t - that biologists shouldn''t get so hot under the
  collar. Perhaps we should just accept the popular demand that we teach ID as well
  as evolution in science classes. It would, after all, take only about 10 minutes
  to exhaust the case for ID, then we could get back to teaching real science and
  genuine controversy.Tempting as this is, a serious worry remains. The seductive
  "let''s teach the controversy" language still conveys the false, and highly pernicious,
  idea that there really are two sides. This would distract students from the genuinely
  important and interesting controversies that enliven evolutionary discourse. Worse,
  it would hand creationism the only victory it realistically aspires to. Without
  needing to make a single good point in any argument, it would have won the right
  for a form of supernaturalism to be recognised as an authentic part of science.
  And that would be the end of science education in America.Arguments worth having
  ...The "Cambrian Explosion"Although the fossil record shows that the first multicellular
  animals lived about 640m years ago, the diversity of species was low until about
  530m years ago. At that time there was a sudden explosion of many diverse marine
  species, including the first appearance of molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms and
  vertebrates. "Sudden" here is used in the geological sense; the "explosion" occurred
  over a period of 10m to 30m years, which is, after all, comparable to the time taken
  to evolve most of the great radiations of mammals. This rapid diversification raises
  fascinating questions; explanations include the evolution of organisms with hard
  parts (which aid fossilisation), the evolutionary "discovery" of eyes, and the development
  of new genes that allowed parts of organisms to evolve independently.The evolutionary
  basis of human behaviourThe field of evolutionary psychology (once called "sociobiology")
  maintains that many universal traits of human behaviour (especially sexual behaviour),
  as well as differences between individuals and between ethnic groups, have a genetic
  basis. These traits and differences are said to have evolved in our ancestors via
  natural selection. There is much controversy about these claims, largely because
  it is hard to reconstruct the evolutionary forces that acted on our ancestors, and
  it is unethical to do genetic experiments on modern humans.Sexual versus natural
  selectionAlthough evolutionists agree that adaptations invariably result from natural
  selection, there are many traits, such as the elaborate plumage of male birds and
  size differences between the sexes in many species, that are better explained by
  "sexual selection": selection based on members of one sex (usually females) preferring
  to mate with members of the other sex that show certain desirable traits. Evolutionists
  debate how many features of animals have resulted from sexual as opposed to natural
  selection; some, like Darwin himself, feel that many physical features differentiating
  human "races" resulted from sexual selection.The target of natural selectionEvolutionists
  agree that natural selection usually acts on genes in organisms - individuals carrying
  genes that give them a reproductive or survival advantage over others will leave
  more descendants, gradually changing the genetic composition of a species. This
  is called "individual selection". But some evolutionists have proposed that selection
  can act at higher levels as well: on populations (group selection), or even on species
  themselves (species selection). The relative importance of individual versus these
  higher order forms of selection is a topic of lively debate.Natural selection versus
  genetic driftNatural selection is a process that leads to the replacement of one
  gene by another in a predictable way. But there is also a "random" evolutionary
  process called genetic drift, which is the genetic equivalent of coin-tossing. Genetic
  drift leads to unpredictable changes in the frequencies of genes that don''t make
  much difference to the adaptation of their carriers, and can cause evolution by
  changing the genetic composition of populations. Many features of DNA are said to
  have evolved by genetic drift. Evolutionary geneticists disagree about the importance
  of selection versus drift in explaining features of organisms and their DNA. All
  evolutionists agree that genetic drift can''t explain adaptive evolution. But not
  all evolution is adaptive.Further readingwww.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdescUser-friendly

  on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt sounds so reasonable, doesn't it?
  Such a modest proposal. Why not teach \"both sides\" and let the children decide
  for themselves? As President Bush said, \"You're asking me whether or not people
  ought to be exposed to different ideas, the answer is yes.\" At first hearing, everything
  about the phrase \"both sides\" warms the hearts of educators like ourselves.\nOne
  of us spent years as an Oxford tutor and it was his habit to choose controversial
  topics for the students' weekly essays. They were required to go to the library,
  read about both sides of an argument, give a fair account of both, and then come
  to a balanced judgment in their essay. The call for balance, by the way, was always
  tempered by the maxim, \"When two opposite points of view are expressed with equal
  intensity, the truth does not necessarily lie exactly half way between. It is possible
  for one side simply to be wrong.\"\nAs teachers, both of us have found that asking
  our students to analyse controversies is of enormous value to their education. What
  is wrong, then, with teaching both sides of the alleged controversy between evolution
  and creationism or \"intelligent design\" (ID)? And, by the way, don't be fooled
  by the disingenuous euphemism. There is nothing new about ID. It is simply creationism
  camouflaged with a new name to slip (with some success, thanks to loads of tax-free
  money and slick public-relations professionals) under the radar of the US Constitution's
  mandate for separation between church and state.\nWhy, then, would two lifelong
  educators and passionate advocates of the \"both sides\" style of teaching join
  with essentially all biologists in making an exception of the alleged controversy
  between creation and evolution? What is wrong with the apparently sweet reasonableness
  of \"it is only fair to teach both sides\"? The answer is simple. This is not a
  scientific controversy at all. And it is a time-wasting distraction because evolutionary
  science, perhaps more than any other major science, is bountifully endowed with
  genuine controversy.\nAmong the controversies that students of evolution commonly
  face, these are genuinely challenging and of great educational value: neutralism
  versus selectionism in molecular evolution; adaptationism; group selection; punctuated
  equilibrium; cladism; \"evo-devo\"; the \"Cambrian Explosion\"; mass extinctions;
  interspecies competition; sympatric speciation; sexual selection; the evolution
  of sex itself; evolutionary psychology; Darwinian medicine and so on. The point
  is that all these controversies, and many more, provide fodder for fascinating and
  lively argument, not just in essays but for student discussions late at night.\nIntelligent
  design is not an argument of the same character as these controversies. It is not
  a scientific argument at all, but a religious one. It might be worth discussing
  in a class on the history of ideas, in a philosophy class on popular logical fallacies,
  or in a comparative religion class on origin myths from around the world. But it
  no more belongs in a biology class than alchemy belongs in a chemistry class, phlogiston
  in a physics class or the stork theory in a sex education class. In those cases,
  the demand for equal time for \"both theories\" would be ludicrous. Similarly, in
  a class on 20th-century European history, who would demand equal time for the theory
  that the Holocaust never happened?\nSo, why are we so sure that intelligent design
  is not a real scientific theory, worthy of \"both sides\" treatment? Isn't that
  just our personal opinion? It is an opinion shared by the vast majority of professional
  biologists, but of course science does not proceed by majority vote among scientists.
  Why isn't creationism (or its incarnation as intelligent design) just another scientific
  controversy, as worthy of scientific debate as the dozen essay topics we listed
  above? Here's why.\nIf ID really were a scientific theory, positive evidence for
  it, gathered through research, would fill peer-reviewed scientific journals. This
  doesn't happen. It isn't that editors refuse to publish ID research. There simply
  isn't any ID research to publish. Its advocates bypass normal scientific due process
  by appealing directly to the non-scientific public and - with great shrewdness -
  to the government officials they elect.\nThe argument the ID advocates put, such
  as it is, is always of the same character. Never do they offer positive evidence
  in favour of intelligent design. All we ever get is a list of alleged deficiencies
  in evolution. We are told of \"gaps\" in the fossil record. Or organs are stated,
  by fiat and without supporting evidence, to be \"irreducibly complex\": too complex
  to have evolved by natural selection.\nIn all cases there is a hidden (actually
  they scarcely even bother to hide it) \"default\" assumption that if Theory A has
  some difficulty in explaining Phenomenon X, we must automatically prefer Theory
  B without even asking whether Theory B (creationism in this case) is any better
  at explaining it. Note how unbalanced this is, and how it gives the lie to the apparent
  reasonableness of \"let's teach both sides\". One side is required to produce evidence,
  every step of the way. The other side is never required to produce one iota of evidence,
  but is deemed to have won automatically, the moment the first side encounters a
  difficulty - the sort of difficulty that all sciences encounter every day, and go
  to work to solve, with relish.\nWhat, after all, is a gap in the fossil record?
  It is simply the absence of a fossil which would otherwise have documented a particular
  evolutionary transition. The gap means that we lack a complete cinematic record
  of every step in the evolutionary process. But how incredibly presumptuous to demand
  a complete record, given that only a minuscule proportion of deaths result in a
  fossil anyway.\nThe equivalent evidential demand of creationism would be a complete
  cinematic record of God's behaviour on the day that he went to work on, say, the
  mammalian ear bones or the bacterial flagellum - the small, hair-like organ that
  propels mobile bacteria. Not even the most ardent advocate of intelligent design
  claims that any such divine videotape will ever become available.\nBiologists, on
  the other hand, can confidently claim the equivalent \"cinematic\" sequence of fossils
  for a very large number of evolutionary transitions. Not all, but very many, including
  our own descent from the bipedal ape Australopithecus. And - far more telling -
  not a single authentic fossil has ever been found in the \"wrong\" place in the
  evolutionary sequence. Such an anachronistic fossil, if one were ever unearthed,
  would blow evolution out of the water.\nAs the great biologist J B S Haldane growled,
  when asked what might disprove evolution: \"Fossil rabbits in the pre-Cambrian.\"
  Evolution, like all good theories, makes itself vulnerable to disproof. Needless
  to say, it has always come through with flying colours.\nSimilarly, the claim that
  something - say the bacterial flagellum - is too complex to have evolved by natural
  selection is alleged, by a lamentably common but false syllogism, to support the
  \"rival\" intelligent design theory by default. This kind of default reasoning leaves
  completely open the possibility that, if the bacterial flagellum is too complex
  to have evolved, it might also be too complex to have been created. And indeed,
  a moment's thought shows that any God capable of creating a bacterial flagellum
  (to say nothing of a universe) would have to be a far more complex, and therefore
  statistically improbable, entity than the bacterial flagellum (or universe) itself
  - even more in need of an explanation than the object he is alleged to have created.\nIf
  complex organisms demand an explanation, so does a complex designer. And it's no
  solution to raise the theologian's plea that God (or the Intelligent Designer) is
  simply immune to the normal demands of scientific explanation. To do so would be
  to shoot yourself in the foot. You cannot have it both ways. Either ID belongs in
  the science classroom, in which case it must submit to the discipline required of
  a scientific hypothesis. Or it does not, in which case get it out of the science
  classroom and send it back into the church, where it belongs.\nIn fact, the bacterial
  flagellum is certainly not too complex to have evolved, nor is any other living
  structure that has ever been carefully studied. Biologists have located plausible
  series of intermediates, using ingredients to be found elsewhere in living systems.
  But even if some particular case were found for which biologists could offer no
  ready explanation, the important point is that the \"default\" logic of the creationists
  remains thoroughly rotten.\nThere is no evidence in favour of intelligent design:
  only alleged gaps in the completeness of the evolutionary account, coupled with
  the \"default\" fallacy we have identified. And, while it is inevitably true that
  there are incompletenesses in evolutionary science, the positive evidence for the
  fact of evolution is truly massive, made up of hundreds of thousands of mutually
  corroborating observations. These come from areas such as geology, paleontology,
  comparative anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, ethology, biogeography, embryology
  and - increasingly nowadays - molecular genetics.\nThe weight of the evidence has
  become so heavy that opposition to the fact of evolution is laughable to all who
  are acquainted with even a fraction of the published data. Evolution is a fact:
  as much a fact as plate tectonics or the heliocentric solar system.\nWhy, finally,
  does it matter whether these issues are discussed in science classes? There is a
  case for saying that it doesn't - that biologists shouldn't get so hot under the
  collar. Perhaps we should just accept the popular demand that we teach ID as well
  as evolution in science classes. It would, after all, take only about 10 minutes
  to exhaust the case for ID, then we could get back to teaching real science and
  genuine controversy.\nTempting as this is, a serious worry remains. The seductive
  \"let's teach the controversy\" language still conveys the false, and highly pernicious,
  idea that there really are two sides. This would distract students from the genuinely
  important and interesting controversies that enliven evolutionary discourse. Worse,
  it would hand creationism the only victory it realistically aspires to. Without
  needing to make a single good point in any argument, it would have won the right
  for a form of supernaturalism to be recognised as an authentic part of science.
  And that would be the end of science education in America.\nArguments worth having
  ...\nThe \"Cambrian Explosion\"\nAlthough the fossil record shows that the first
  multicellular animals lived about 640m years ago, the diversity of species was low
  until about 530m years ago. At that time there was a sudden explosion of many diverse
  marine species, including the first appearance of molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms
  and vertebrates. \"Sudden\" here is used in the geological sense; the \"explosion\"
  occurred over a period of 10m to 30m years, which is, after all, comparable to the
  time taken to evolve most of the great radiations of mammals. This rapid diversification
  raises fascinating questions; explanations include the evolution of organisms with
  hard parts (which aid fossilisation), the evolutionary \"discovery\" of eyes, and
  the development of new genes that allowed parts of organisms to evolve independently.\nThe
  evolutionary basis of human behaviour\nThe field of evolutionary psychology (once
  called \"sociobiology\") maintains that many universal traits of human behaviour
  (especially sexual behaviour), as well as differences between individuals and between
  ethnic groups, have a genetic basis. These traits and differences are said to have
  evolved in our ancestors via natural selection. There is much controversy about
  these claims, largely because it is hard to reconstruct the evolutionary forces
  that acted on our ancestors, and it is unethical to do genetic experiments on modern
  humans.\nSexual versus natural selection\nAlthough evolutionists agree that adaptations
  invariably result from natural selection, there are many traits, such as the elaborate
  plumage of male birds and size differences between the sexes in many species, that
  are better explained by \"sexual selection\": selection based on members of one
  sex (usually females) preferring to mate with members of the other sex that show
  certain desirable traits. Evolutionists debate how many features of animals have
  resulted from sexual as opposed to natural selection; some, like Darwin himself,
  feel that many physical features differentiating human \"races\" resulted from sexual
  selection.\nThe target of natural selection\nEvolutionists agree that natural selection
  usually acts on genes in organisms - individuals carrying genes that give them a
  reproductive or survival advantage over others will leave more descendants, gradually
  changing the genetic composition of a species. This is called \"individual selection\".
  But some evolutionists have proposed that selection can act at higher levels as
  well: on populations (group selection), or even on species themselves (species selection).
  The relative importance of individual versus these higher order forms of selection
  is a topic of lively debate.\nNatural selection versus genetic drift\nNatural selection
  is a process that leads to the replacement of one gene by another in a predictable
  way. But there is also a \"random\" evolutionary process called genetic drift, which
  is the genetic equivalent of coin-tossing. Genetic drift leads to unpredictable
  changes in the frequencies of genes that don't make much difference to the adaptation
  of their carriers, and can cause evolution by changing the genetic composition of
  populations. Many features of DNA are said to have evolved by genetic drift. Evolutionary
  geneticists disagree about the importance of selection versus drift in explaining
  features of organisms and their DNA. All evolutionists agree that genetic drift
  can't explain adaptive evolution. But not all evolution is adaptive.\nFurther reading\nwww.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdescUser-friendly

  2 September 2005 11.51 EDT\nIt sounds so reasonable, doesn't it? Such a modest proposal.
  Why not teach \"both sides\" and let the children decide for themselves? As President
  Bush said, \"You're asking me whether or not people ought to be exposed to different
  ideas, the answer is yes.\" At first hearing, everything about the phrase \"both
  sides\" warms the hearts of educators like ourselves.One of us spent years as an
  Oxford tutor and it was his habit to choose controversial topics for the students'
  weekly essays. They were required to go to the library, read about both sides of
  an argument, give a fair account of both, and then come to a balanced judgment in
  their essay. The call for balance, by the way, was always tempered by the maxim,
  \"When two opposite points of view are expressed with equal intensity, the truth
  does not necessarily lie exactly half way between. It is possible for one side simply
  to be wrong.\"As teachers, both of us have found that asking our students to analyse
  controversies is of enormous value to their education. What is wrong, then, with
  teaching both sides of the alleged controversy between evolution and creationism
  or \"intelligent design\" (ID)? And, by the way, don't be fooled by the disingenuous
  euphemism. There is nothing new about ID. It is simply creationism camouflaged with
  a new name to slip (with some success, thanks to loads of tax-free money and slick
  public-relations professionals) under the radar of the US Constitution's mandate
  for separation between church and state.Why, then, would two lifelong educators
  and passionate advocates of the \"both sides\" style of teaching join with essentially
  all biologists in making an exception of the alleged controversy between creation
  and evolution? What is wrong with the apparently sweet reasonableness of \"it is
  only fair to teach both sides\"? The answer is simple. This is not a scientific
  controversy at all. And it is a time-wasting distraction because evolutionary science,
  perhaps more than any other major science, is bountifully endowed with genuine controversy.Among
  the controversies that students of evolution commonly face, these are genuinely
  challenging and of great educational value: neutralism versus selectionism in molecular
  evolution; adaptationism; group selection; punctuated equilibrium; cladism; \"evo-devo\";
  the \"Cambrian Explosion\"; mass extinctions; interspecies competition; sympatric
  speciation; sexual selection; the evolution of sex itself; evolutionary psychology;
  Darwinian medicine and so on. The point is that all these controversies, and many
  more, provide fodder for fascinating and lively argument, not just in essays but
  for student discussions late at night.Intelligent design is not an argument of the
  same character as these controversies. It is not a scientific argument at all, but
  a religious one. It might be worth discussing in a class on the history of ideas,
  in a philosophy class on popular logical fallacies, or in a comparative religion
  class on origin myths from around the world. But it no more belongs in a biology
  class than alchemy belongs in a chemistry class, phlogiston in a physics class or
  the stork theory in a sex education class. In those cases, the demand for equal
  time for \"both theories\" would be ludicrous. Similarly, in a class on 20th-century
  European history, who would demand equal time for the theory that the Holocaust
  never happened?So, why are we so sure that intelligent design is not a real scientific
  theory, worthy of \"both sides\" treatment? Isn't that just our personal opinion?
  It is an opinion shared by the vast majority of professional biologists, but of
  course science does not proceed by majority vote among scientists. Why isn't creationism
  (or its incarnation as intelligent design) just another scientific controversy,
  as worthy of scientific debate as the dozen essay topics we listed above? Here's
  why.If ID really were a scientific theory, positive evidence for it, gathered through
  research, would fill peer-reviewed scientific journals. This doesn't happen. It
  isn't that editors refuse to publish ID research. There simply isn't any ID research
  to publish. Its advocates bypass normal scientific due process by appealing directly
  to the non-scientific public and - with great shrewdness - to the government officials
  they elect.The argument the ID advocates put, such as it is, is always of the same
  character. Never do they offer positive evidence in favour of intelligent design.
  All we ever get is a list of alleged deficiencies in evolution. We are told of \"gaps\"
  in the fossil record. Or organs are stated, by fiat and without supporting evidence,
  to be \"irreducibly complex\": too complex to have evolved by natural selection.In
  all cases there is a hidden (actually they scarcely even bother to hide it) \"default\"
  assumption that if Theory A has some difficulty in explaining Phenomenon X, we must
  automatically prefer Theory B without even asking whether Theory B (creationism
  in this case) is any better at explaining it. Note how unbalanced this is, and how
  it gives the lie to the apparent reasonableness of \"let's teach both sides\". One
  side is required to produce evidence, every step of the way. The other side is never
  required to produce one iota of evidence, but is deemed to have won automatically,
  the moment the first side encounters a difficulty - the sort of difficulty that
  all sciences encounter every day, and go to work to solve, with relish.What, after
  all, is a gap in the fossil record? It is simply the absence of a fossil which would
  otherwise have documented a particular evolutionary transition. The gap means that
  we lack a complete cinematic record of every step in the evolutionary process. But
  how incredibly presumptuous to demand a complete record, given that only a minuscule
  proportion of deaths result in a fossil anyway.The equivalent evidential demand
  of creationism would be a complete cinematic record of God's behaviour on the day
  that he went to work on, say, the mammalian ear bones or the bacterial flagellum
  - the small, hair-like organ that propels mobile bacteria. Not even the most ardent
  advocate of intelligent design claims that any such divine videotape will ever become
  available.Biologists, on the other hand, can confidently claim the equivalent \"cinematic\"
  sequence of fossils for a very large number of evolutionary transitions. Not all,
  but very many, including our own descent from the bipedal ape Australopithecus.
  And - far more telling - not a single authentic fossil has ever been found in the
  \"wrong\" place in the evolutionary sequence. Such an anachronistic fossil, if one
  were ever unearthed, would blow evolution out of the water.As the great biologist
  J B S Haldane growled, when asked what might disprove evolution: \"Fossil rabbits
  in the pre-Cambrian.\" Evolution, like all good theories, makes itself vulnerable
  to disproof. Needless to say, it has always come through with flying colours.Similarly,
  the claim that something - say the bacterial flagellum - is too complex to have
  evolved by natural selection is alleged, by a lamentably common but false syllogism,
  to support the \"rival\" intelligent design theory by default. This kind of default
  reasoning leaves completely open the possibility that, if the bacterial flagellum
  is too complex to have evolved, it might also be too complex to have been created.
  And indeed, a moment's thought shows that any God capable of creating a bacterial
  flagellum (to say nothing of a universe) would have to be a far more complex, and
  therefore statistically improbable, entity than the bacterial flagellum (or universe)
  itself - even more in need of an explanation than the object he is alleged to have
  created.If complex organisms demand an explanation, so does a complex designer.
  And it's no solution to raise the theologian's plea that God (or the Intelligent
  Designer) is simply immune to the normal demands of scientific explanation. To do
  so would be to shoot yourself in the foot. You cannot have it both ways. Either
  ID belongs in the science classroom, in which case it must submit to the discipline
  required of a scientific hypothesis. Or it does not, in which case get it out of
  the science classroom and send it back into the church, where it belongs.In fact,
  the bacterial flagellum is certainly not too complex to have evolved, nor is any
  other living structure that has ever been carefully studied. Biologists have located
  plausible series of intermediates, using ingredients to be found elsewhere in living
  systems. But even if some particular case were found for which biologists could
  offer no ready explanation, the important point is that the \"default\" logic of
  the creationists remains thoroughly rotten.There is no evidence in favour of intelligent
  design: only alleged gaps in the completeness of the evolutionary account, coupled
  with the \"default\" fallacy we have identified. And, while it is inevitably true
  that there are incompletenesses in evolutionary science, the positive evidence for
  the fact of evolution is truly massive, made up of hundreds of thousands of mutually
  corroborating observations. These come from areas such as geology, paleontology,
  comparative anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, ethology, biogeography, embryology
  and - increasingly nowadays - molecular genetics.The weight of the evidence has
  become so heavy that opposition to the fact of evolution is laughable to all who
  are acquainted with even a fraction of the published data. Evolution is a fact:
  as much a fact as plate tectonics or the heliocentric solar system.Why, finally,
  does it matter whether these issues are discussed in science classes? There is a
  case for saying that it doesn't - that biologists shouldn't get so hot under the
  collar. Perhaps we should just accept the popular demand that we teach ID as well
  as evolution in science classes. It would, after all, take only about 10 minutes
  to exhaust the case for ID, then we could get back to teaching real science and
  genuine controversy.Tempting as this is, a serious worry remains. The seductive
  \"let's teach the controversy\" language still conveys the false, and highly pernicious,
  idea that there really are two sides. This would distract students from the genuinely
  important and interesting controversies that enliven evolutionary discourse. Worse,
  it would hand creationism the only victory it realistically aspires to. Without
  needing to make a single good point in any argument, it would have won the right
  for a form of supernaturalism to be recognised as an authentic part of science.
  And that would be the end of science education in America.Arguments worth having
  ...The \"Cambrian Explosion\"Although the fossil record shows that the first multicellular
  animals lived about 640m years ago, the diversity of species was low until about
  530m years ago. At that time there was a sudden explosion of many diverse marine
  species, including the first appearance of molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms and
  vertebrates. \"Sudden\" here is used in the geological sense; the \"explosion\"
  occurred over a period of 10m to 30m years, which is, after all, comparable to the
  time taken to evolve most of the great radiations of mammals. This rapid diversification
  raises fascinating questions; explanations include the evolution of organisms with
  hard parts (which aid fossilisation), the evolutionary \"discovery\" of eyes, and
  the development of new genes that allowed parts of organisms to evolve independently.The
  evolutionary basis of human behaviourThe field of evolutionary psychology (once
  called \"sociobiology\") maintains that many universal traits of human behaviour
  (especially sexual behaviour), as well as differences between individuals and between
  ethnic groups, have a genetic basis. These traits and differences are said to have
  evolved in our ancestors via natural selection. There is much controversy about
  these claims, largely because it is hard to reconstruct the evolutionary forces
  that acted on our ancestors, and it is unethical to do genetic experiments on modern
  humans.Sexual versus natural selectionAlthough evolutionists agree that adaptations
  invariably result from natural selection, there are many traits, such as the elaborate
  plumage of male birds and size differences between the sexes in many species, that
  are better explained by \"sexual selection\": selection based on members of one
  sex (usually females) preferring to mate with members of the other sex that show
  certain desirable traits. Evolutionists debate how many features of animals have
  resulted from sexual as opposed to natural selection; some, like Darwin himself,
  feel that many physical features differentiating human \"races\" resulted from sexual
  selection.The target of natural selectionEvolutionists agree that natural selection
  usually acts on genes in organisms - individuals carrying genes that give them a
  reproductive or survival advantage over others will leave more descendants, gradually
  changing the genetic composition of a species. This is called \"individual selection\".
  But some evolutionists have proposed that selection can act at higher levels as
  well: on populations (group selection), or even on species themselves (species selection).
  The relative importance of individual versus these higher order forms of selection
  is a topic of lively debate.Natural selection versus genetic driftNatural selection
  is a process that leads to the replacement of one gene by another in a predictable
  way. But there is also a \"random\" evolutionary process called genetic drift, which
  is the genetic equivalent of coin-tossing. Genetic drift leads to unpredictable
  changes in the frequencies of genes that don't make much difference to the adaptation
  of their carriers, and can cause evolution by changing the genetic composition of
  populations. Many features of DNA are said to have evolved by genetic drift. Evolutionary
  geneticists disagree about the importance of selection versus drift in explaining
  features of organisms and their DNA. All evolutionists agree that genetic drift
  can't explain adaptive evolution. But not all evolution is adaptive.Further readingwww.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdescUser-friendly
