                  Dec. 2, 2015by April TolerStanding among the cans of fruit, boxes of macaroni and cheese and sticks of deodorant, IU senior Mercedes Jones couldn’t help but feel proud.
- |
  Almost six months after she began researching ways to create a food pantry on campus, Jones’ hard work has finally paid off. Crimson Cupboard, a food pantry for students on the IU Bloomington campus, had its opening day on Tuesday, an event Jones was ecstatic to see.

- |
  “It’s baffling to look in the space and to see what wasn’t there and what’s there now,” she said. “For this thing to be talked about for so many years and to have it happen in the past five months, it’s amazing.”
- |
  Jones, who is studying public management in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs, began working on the pantry over the summer during an internship with the IU Student Advocates Office. The idea for a pantry has been discussed for some time, but it wasn’t until Jones, with the help of the Student Assistant Initiative, began working on it, that the idea became a reality.
- |
  Jones helped secure a location, came up with a name, made the pantry an official IU student organization, rounded up volunteers to run the pantry and has started a GoFundMe page to raise both monetary and food donations.
- |
  “It hasn’t been easy,” Jones said. “But it’s been worth it. It’s not about me, but I’m glad I was put in this situation because I knew that I wasn’t going to stop until it got done.”
- |
  Although the pantry is now up and running, Jones work is far from over. Her goal now is to make sure the pantry is widely promoted and that students feel comfortable using it. She is making an effort to stock the pantry with not only foods that students will like, but foods they can easily prepare if they live in a dorm or small apartment.
- |
  She is also working on keeping volunteers interested in running the pantry, especially since she will be graduating in the spring. Erika Wheeler, a junior studying community health, is one of the volunteers who hopes to keep Jones’ work going.
- |
  Wheeler got involved after meeting Jones at this year’s student involvement fair. Now serving as donations coordinator, Wheeler hopes to not only help make the pantry a success but to also shed light on student hunger.
- |
  “I've seen a huge spectrum of misconception about student hunger,” she said. “On one end, you have people that assume that simply because a student can afford college, they should be able to take care of basic necessities, like food. On the other end, you have people with this romanticized notion that living off Ramen and cereal is just part of the student experience. The fact is, that because a student is paying for the cost of college (not to mention housing, utilities, transportation, textbooks) they are more at risk for food insecurity.”
- |
  While Jones has been the biggest force behind the project, she said the support she has received from the campus and peers like Wheeler has been astounding.

  “This summer I just wanted to quit, because it was so overwhelming,” a teary-eyed Jones said. “But seeing the amount of money that has been raised so far, in such a short amount of time, is amazing. It’s overwhelming to know your efforts haven’t gone in vain. I’m just ready to see it up and running and to see people use it.”
- |
  Although all of Jones’ work has been done in an effort to help others, she too has gained invaluable experience and friendships from creating the pantry.
- |
  “I’m highly involved on campus and I’m involved in number of organizations, but this one project has done so much for me and showed me where I want to end up in life,” she said. “Taking this leap of faith on this one internship turned into so much. Just knowing the need is met makes it so worth while to me.”
- |
  About the pantry:
- |
  Crimson Cupboard is in Room 189 on the first floor of the Campus View Apartments, 800 N. Union St.
- |
  December hours will be 1 to 4 p.m. Dec. 4, 5 to 8 p.m. Dec. 8, 1 to 4 p.m. Dec. 11, 4 to 8 p.m., Dec. 13, 5 to 8 p.m. Dec. 15 and 3 to 6 p.m. Dec. 20. A spring schedule will be set soon.
- |
  The pantry will be open to all IU Bloomington students. A student ID is needed to receive services and food will be dispensed according to a point system that measures family size.
- |
  More information about the pantry, including ways to donate, can be found on Jones’ GoFundMe page or by emailing Jones at jonesmem@umail.iu.edu.
- |
  Crimson Cupboard aligns with several priorities in the university's Bicentennial Strategic Plan, including a commitment to student success.Read more Campus Life stories »

  \               Dec. 2, 2015by April TolerStanding among the cans of fruit, boxes
  of macaroni and cheese and sticks of deodorant, IU senior Mercedes Jones couldn’t
  help but feel proud.\nAlmost six months after she began researching ways to create
  a food pantry on campus, Jones’ hard work has finally paid off. Crimson Cupboard,
  a food pantry for students on the IU Bloomington campus, had its opening day on
  Tuesday, an event Jones was ecstatic to see.\nVolunteer Christiana Jerry places
  canned goods on the shelves of the Crimson Cupboard food pantry. | PHOTO BY CHRIS
  MEYER, IU COMMUNICATIONS\n“It’s baffling to look in the space and to see what wasn’t
  there and what’s there now,” she said. “For this thing to be talked about for so
  many years and to have it happen in the past five months, it’s amazing.”\nJones,
  who is studying public management in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs,
  began working on the pantry over the summer during an internship with the IU Student
  Advocates Office. The idea for a pantry has been discussed for some time, but it
  wasn’t until Jones, with the help of the Student Assistant Initiative, began working
  on it, that the idea became a reality.\nJones helped secure a location, came up
  with a name, made the pantry an official IU student organization, rounded up volunteers
  to run the pantry and has started a GoFundMe page to raise both monetary and food
  donations.\n“It hasn’t been easy,” Jones said. “But it’s been worth it. It’s not
  about me, but I’m glad I was put in this situation because I knew that I wasn’t
  going to stop until it got done.”\nAlthough the pantry is now up and running, Jones
  work is far from over. Her goal now is to make sure the pantry is widely promoted
  and that students feel comfortable using it. She is making an effort to stock the
  pantry with not only foods that students will like, but foods they can easily prepare
  if they live in a dorm or small apartment.\nShe is also working on keeping volunteers
  interested in running the pantry, especially since she will be graduating in the
  spring. Erika Wheeler, a junior studying community health, is one of the volunteers
  who hopes to keep Jones’ work going.\nWheeler got involved after meeting Jones at
  this year’s student involvement fair. Now serving as donations coordinator, Wheeler
  hopes to not only help make the pantry a success but to also shed light on student
  hunger.\n“I've seen a huge spectrum of misconception about student hunger,” she
  said. “On one end, you have people that assume that simply because a student can
  afford college, they should be able to take care of basic necessities, like food.
  On the other end, you have people with this romanticized notion that living off
  Ramen and cereal is just part of the student experience. The fact is, that because
  a student is paying for the cost of college (not to mention housing, utilities,
  transportation, textbooks) they are more at risk for food insecurity.”\nWhile Jones
  has been the biggest force behind the project, she said the support she has received
  from the campus and peers like Wheeler has been astounding.\nIU senior Mercedes

  BY CHRIS MEYER, IU COMMUNICATIONS\n“This summer I just wanted to quit, because it
  was so overwhelming,” a teary-eyed Jones said. “But seeing the amount of money that
  has been raised so far, in such a short amount of time, is amazing. It’s overwhelming
  to know your efforts haven’t gone in vain. I’m just ready to see it up and running
  and to see people use it.”\nAlthough all of Jones’ work has been done in an effort
  to help others, she too has gained invaluable experience and friendships from creating
  the pantry.\n“I’m highly involved on campus and I’m involved in number of organizations,
  but this one project has done so much for me and showed me where I want to end up
  in life,” she said. “Taking this leap of faith on this one internship turned into
  so much. Just knowing the need is met makes it so worth while to me.”\nAbout the
  pantry:\nCrimson Cupboard is in Room 189 on the first floor of the Campus View Apartments,
  800 N. Union St.\nDecember hours will be 1 to 4 p.m. Dec. 4, 5 to 8 p.m. Dec. 8,
  1 to 4 p.m. Dec. 11, 4 to 8 p.m., Dec. 13, 5 to 8 p.m. Dec. 15 and 3 to 6 p.m. Dec.
  20. A spring schedule will be set soon.\nThe pantry will be open to all IU Bloomington
  students. A student ID is needed to receive services and food will be dispensed
  according to a point system that measures family size.\nMore information about the
  pantry, including ways to donate, can be found on Jones’ GoFundMe page or by emailing
  Jones at jonesmem@umail.iu.edu.\nCrimson Cupboard aligns with several priorities
  in the university's Bicentennial Strategic Plan, including a commitment to student
  success.Read more Campus Life stories »\n        \n    \n                \n            \n
