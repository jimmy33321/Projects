                  ANALOGY OF THEBODY POLITIC
- |2
                  The analogy of the body politic is the perception
- |2
                      and elaboration of correspondences between society or the state and
- |2
                      the individual human body. These corre-
- |2
                          spondences may then be applied in a variety of ways in political
- |2
                      analysis or argument. In their simplest form, these arguments assert that
- |2
                      given the organic nature of the state, then certain political structures or
- |2
                      actions are necessarily appropriate. A “natural”
- |2
                      society is one which functions in a manner similar to the human body.
- |2
                      In the history of political philosophy and po-
- |2
                      lemic, the analogy has been applied to many different forms of
- |2
                      government and in support of a variety of particular opinions. In general,
- |2
                      however, these states are hierarchical and authoritarian and the ideas
- |2
                      being supported are conservative, stressing social order and
- |2
                      obedience. There are a number of important excep-
- |2
                          tions. As a strategy of argumentation, moreover, the analogy is
- |2
                      used in many different genres—philosophical treatise, political
- |2
                      exhortation, sermon, poem, or drama. The analogy may appear as an allusive
- |2
                      phrase or it may provide the structure for an extended discussion.
- |2
                      Historically speaking, the analogy was used extensively from the time of
- |2
                      the Greeks to the seventeenth century, when it was effectively challenged
- |2
                      by another analogy, that of the social contract; in the nineteenth
- |2
                      century developments in the study of biological evolution gave new
- |2
                      impetus and application to the analogy.

- |2
                  The analogy of the body politic rests on two princi-
- |2
                          ples which were articulated by the Greeks. First, the doctrine
- |2
                      of hylozoism asserts that mind or life perme-
- |2
                      ates the natural world. The individual possesses life or soul or
- |2
                      mind which is in some way identical to thehomonoia which animates, unifies, and directs the
- |2
                      state. This mind is the source of the regularity in nature which makes
- |2
                      possible science, including political sci- ence.
- |2
                      This concept permits discussion of the relative health or sickness of the
- |2
                      body politic and the suggesting of cures, perhaps by a ruler acting as a
- |2
                      physician. The second basic principle asserts that one simple pattern
- |2
                      exists at many levels of being; this pattern is most perfectly manifested
- |2
                      in the human body (Plato,Timaeus 30c). In a variety of accounts, creation
- |2
                      consists of the imposition of this pattern on previously chaotic
- |2
                      matter. Since the citizen, the microcosm, and the larger world of the state
- |2
                      possess an identical life and an iden- tical
- |2
                      physical structure, then more specific description and prescription are
- |2
                      possible.
- |2
                  The earliest, though fragmentary, examples of the analogy come from India.
- |2
                      The Rig-Veda (X, 90) con-
- |2
                      tains a hymn describing the creation of four castes—
- |2
                      priests, warriors, shepherds, and servants—from the body of
- |2
                      Purusa, a sacrificial personification of the world-soul. The Mahabharata (XIV, xxii) gives a debate between the
- |2
                      mind and the perceiving organs, the point of which is that human arrogance
- |2
                      comes from an ig- norance of how the members
- |2
                      of society must cooperate.
- |2
                  More substantial examples appear in Greek political writers, who
- |2
                      specifically apply the analogy to the polis. Plato
- |2
                      begins the Republic by establishing analogy as a
- |2
                      mode of inquiry: if justice in a state can be defined, then justice in an
- |2
                      individual can also be determined. He then contrasts a simple,
- |2
                      “healthy” society and a
- |2
                      “feverish” one corrupted by luxury. By an extension
- |2
                      of the analogy, the cure for a “festering” society is
- |2
                      not the multiplication of petty laws, but a rigorous transformation of the
- |2
                      state and the individual so that both will exhibit a centralized, rational
- |2
                      control and an appropriate division of labor. In the later Laws (628c ff.) Plato characterizes the highest good
- |2
                      as a peaceful, friendly state, like a healthy body that does not
- |2
                      require medical attention. The organic nature of the state is specifically
- |2
                      enunciated by Aristotle: “Thus the state is by nature clearly
- |2
                      prior to the family and the individual... for example, if the whole body
- |2
                      be destroyed, there will be no foot or hand...” (Politics 1253a). Society, therefore, is a creation
- |2
                      of nature, not of man; man's greatest fulfillment comes from being a
- |2
                      part of the polis.
- |2
                  Other Greek writers also used the analogy. Aris-
- |2
                          tophanes sees one function of the comic poet as the difficult
- |2
                      task of curing the diseases of the state (Wasps
- |2
                       650-51). Demosthenes regards Philip of Macedon as an attack of
- |2
                      fever which Athens must resist. Of partic-
- |2
                      ular interest is the Aesopic fable of the belly and the members (Aesopica, ed. B. E. Perry, Urbana, Ill. [1952], No.
- |2
                      130). In its simplest form the fable teaches the cooperative structural
- |2
                      relationship between the gen- erals and
- |2
                      soldiers in an army. The fable is explicitly political in the Roman
- |2
                      tradition (Livy, II, 32) in which Menenius Agrippa ends a plebeian
- |2
                      secession by ex- plaining the nourishment the
- |2
                      belly (Senate) provides for the hands and feet (common people). The
- |2
                      analogy was also applied occasionally to smaller groups; in Xenophon's
- |2
                          Memorabilia (II, iii) Socrates urges recon- ciliation between quarreling
- |2
                      brothers by citing the harmony of pairs of hands, feet, and eyes.
- |2
                  After the conquests of Alexander, the city-state was a much less relevant
- |2
                      political unit; by praying forhomonoia between Macedonians and Persians, Alex- ander indicated that the analogy of the
- |2
                      body politic could be applied to the much larger Hellenistic mon- archy or even all mankind. Philo Judaeus
- |2
                      urges accep- tance of personal disaster by
- |2
                      comparing the actions of divine providence to an amputation performed
- |2
                      by a surgeon on a partially diseased body. The writings of the Roman
- |2
                      Stoics contain many passages which argue analogically for the necessity of
- |2
                      subordinating the desires of the individual to the well-being of the
- |2
                      state or humanity. Cicero writes that if each part of the body tries to
- |2
                      appropriate the health of the others, then the body will die; such behavior
- |2
                      in men would be equally destructive (De
- |2
                      officis III, 22). Echoing Plato and Aristotle, Seneca says that
- |2
                      as it is unnatural for the hands to destroy the feet, so the need for
- |2
                      harmony, love, and mutual protection causes mankind to protect
- |2
                      individuals (De ira II, 31).
- |2
                  Such statements are the source of one of the most influential uses of the
- |2
                      analogy, Saint Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians: “For as
- |2
                      the body is one, and hath many members... so also is Christ.... And the
- |2
                      eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the
- |2
                      head to the feet, I have no need of you.... Now ye are the body of Christ
- |2
                      and members in partic- ular...” (I
- |2
                      Corinthians 12:12-27). Love (agapē) be- tween the members unifies the body (I
- |2
                      Corinthians 6:15-16). Though some of Paul's language is tradi- tional, the application of the analogy
- |2
                      to the followers of Christ is a significant departure, which contains
- |2
                      the radical implication that faith determines the body of which a man
- |2
                      is a part. In the early Church, Paul's words were frequently quoted in
- |2
                      admonitions against dissension and factionalism (e.g., Saint Basil's
- |2
                      Letters 66, 203, 222). Saint Augustine occasionally describes the
- |2
                      Cities of God and Man as bodies, but his emphasis is on the concept of a
- |2
                      mystical body of the faithful,069
- |2
                       united by having sacramentally eaten the body of Christ.
- |2
                  In the Middle Ages the analogy of the body was developed substantially. Most
- |2
                      previous applications had been rather brief; medieval authors extend it
- "                    in elaborate, sometimes fantastic detail. Though its influ-
  ence on the West is uncertain, the tenth-century \n"
- |2
                          Ency- clopedia
- |2
                       of the Arabic Brotherhood of Sincerity uses organic analogies at
- |2
                      great length: the human body is compared to a city and a kingdom; the
- |2
                      senses are to the soul as counsellors to a king, and so on. Among
- |2
                      Christian writers the analogy is used for a variety of purposes. Most
- |2
                      simply, it appears in devotional litera- ture
- |2
                      to explain charity, grace, or some other aspect of doctrine. It could
- |2
                      supplement the concept of the three estates: clergy-eyes-guidance, nobility-hands- defense,
- |2
                      peasants-feet-agriculture. John of Salisbury'sPolicraticus (1159) adopts for its structure a
- |2
                      substantial comparison of the human body and a kingdom. After
- |2
                      identifying the soul and the clergy, John discusses in detail the other
- |2
                      members of the body: head-prince, heart-senate, hands-soldiers,
- |2
                      stomach-treasury, and feet-farmers. He emphasizes the need for spiritual
- |2
                      unity in the state and proposes cures for various political diseases,
- |2
                      including tyranny. The fable of the belly explains and defends systems of
- |2
                      taxation.
- |2
                  The Church developed Paul's words about the body of Christ to explain the
- |2
                      structure and importance of ecclesiastical institutions. The Church becomes
- |2
                          corpus mysticum et politicum of which the
- |2
                      Pope is the head, kings and emperors but members. Organic analogies
- |2
                      buttress both sides of the period's most profound polit- ical controversies. Saint Thomas Aquinas finds four
- |2
                      points of identity which unify both natural and mysti-
- |2
                          cal bodies, and asserts that the supremacy of the spirit- ual authority corresponds to the soul's
- |2
                      rule of the body. There are three responses to such claims: to
- |2
                      proclaim the importance of some other organ, such as the heart, with
- |2
                      which a king may be equated; to define the state as a body distinct from
- |2
                      the body of the Church; or to deny the importance of the papacy by claiming
- |2
                      that only Christ is the head of the Church. In the late Middle Ages
- |2
                      the second alternative, an extension of the idea of a “mystical
- |2
                      body,” is a convenient illus-
- |2
                      tration of the growing self-consciousness of the national states.

                      Sir John Fortescue's De laudibus legum
- |2
                      Angliae (ca. 1470) says that a body politic, specifically
- |2
                      England, is a corpus mysticum; the laws are
- |2
                      the nerves which unite the body and public spirit is the life-giving
- |2
                      blood. An example of the third alternative is Henry VIII's assumption
- |2
                      of the title “Supreme Head of the Church in England.”
- |2
                  In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the anal-
- |2
                      ogy persisted as part of the period's vigorous medieval
- |2
                       heritage, but at the same time other ideas developed which
- |2
                      effectively challenged the validity of the anal-
- |2
                      ogy. The three main questions to which the analogy was applied are
- |2
                      the nature of the Church, the nature of the state, and the relationship of
- |2
                      the two. Theolo- gians and polemicists had
- |2
                      much to say about the effect of the Reformation on the body of the Church.
- |2
                      Kings and popes competed for the title “head,” and
- |2
                      they denied that each other's institutions could be described by
- |2
                      organic analogies.
- |2
                  Secular rulers invoked the analogy repeatedly to enforce conformity and at
- |2
                      least passive obedience. Even in matters of religion, the word of the
- |2
                      prince had to be followed; rebellion in the state was as un- natural as internal conflict in a body. The ElizabethanHomily Against Disobedience claims that for a
- |2
                      subject to judge a ruler is impiety, “as though the foot
- |2
                      must judge of the head....” At a more perceptive level, the
- |2
                      analogy became a vehicle for social criticism. Thomas Starkey's Dialogue between Pole and Lupset, early in the
- |2
                      sixteenth century, catalogues diseases or imbalances in the four humors as
- |2
                      a structure for discus- sing political and
- |2
                      economic abuses and proposing rem- edies. A few
- |2
                      more radical applications appeared, as in John Milton's Of Reformation in England (1641), which transforms the old fable
- |2
                      of the belly to attack the episcopacy as a cancerous wen.
- |2
                  Shakespeare's Coriolanus is perhaps the most
- |2
                      thoughtful consideration of the applicability of organic analogies in
- |2
                      politics. In the first scene, derived from Livy and Plutarch, Menenius
- |2
                      recounts the fable of the belly in a partially successful attempt to calm a
- |2
                      rioting mob. Organic imagery recurs frequently through the play as the
- |2
                      characters attempt to define the suitability of the proud protagonist. The
- |2
                      action shows that the Senate is not a generous nourisher of the state,
- |2
                      the plebeians are not docile workers; Coriolanus vigorously denies any
- |2
                      unity, organic or otherwise, with the lower classes. The distinction of
- |2
                      Shakespeare's play is that it dramatizes the gap between the ideal
- |2
                      commonwealth suggested by the idea of a body politic, and the politi- cal behavior of men. In some instances
- |2
                      the familiar analogy appears to be little more than a pious fraud
- |2
                      perpetrated by ruthless aristocrats.
- |2
                  The doubts Shakespeare raises about the validity of the analogy are part of
- |2
                      a larger process of questioning and substitution. Some writers
- |2
                      differentiated the bodies as politic and natural; Fernando Vasquez observes
- |2
                      that in a man a limb cannot change its position, no other part can
- |2
                      become the head, authority always resides in the head, and the death of the
- |2
                      head always causes the death of the body—but none of these is
- |2
                      true of the body politic (Controversarium III). Hugo
- |2
                      Grotius made a similar distinction by pointing out the contractual070
- |2
                       origin of the state and the right of a part to protect itself
- |2
                      by secession or other means (De jure II).
- |2
                  To this increasing general skepticism must be added two very significant
- |2
                      factors which essentially destroyed the traditional analogy. The first is
- |2
                      the new science which undercut the basic premisses. Materialism re- placed hylozoism. The pattern which permitted
- |2
                          struc- tural correspondences could be
- |2
                      dismissed as the vain attempt of men to find order where none in fact
- |2
                      existed. The analogy of the body politic exemplifies the Baco- nian Idols which obstruct scientific
- |2
                      inquiry.
- |2
                  Secondly, the concept of a body politic was effec-
- |2
                          tively replaced by the old, but not widely popular, idea of a
- |2
                      social contract. For Calvin and his followers the Church as mystical body
- |2
                      was supplemented by a great emphasis on a covenant, modeled on the one
- |2
                      between God and Abraham. These theories of covenant and contract view
- |2
                      church and state as artificial institutions, created by an act of will of
- |2
                      their individual members and subject to change by them. The new
- |2
                      analogy attempts definition in terms of origin, for which organic
- |2
                      analogies seemed deficient. A striking fusion of the two traditions is
- |2
                      Hobbes' statement (in Leviathan, Part I,
- |2
                      Introduction) that the state is an artificial body, a machine assembled by
- |2
                      man. More typical of the transi- tion are
- |2
                      these words from the Mayflower Compact (1620): “We... covenant
- |2
                      and combine ourselves to- gether into a Civil
- |2
                      Body Politike....” The main point is the combining;
- |2
                      “Body Politike” is simply a synonym for
- |2
                      “political entity” with no further analogical mean- ings intended.
- |2
                  For the last three centuries extended organic analo-
- |2
                          gies have been generally absent from discussions of political
- |2
                      issues. The phrase “body politic” persists, but as a
- |2
                      dead metaphor rather than a meaningful concept for analysis or argument.
- |2
                      Two types of exceptions may be cited from the nineteenth century. First,
- |2
                      there was a moderate amount of imagery used to characterize the
- |2
                      Industrial Revolution and an ideal alternative which might exist in the
- |2
                      future or the medieval past. Thomas Carlyle writes in Sartor Resartus (1833) that government is the
- |2
                      “outward Skin of the Body
- |2
                      Politic,” binding and protecting its constituent parts; the
- |2
                          vivify- ing nervous system is religion.
- |2
                      Mechanism, capitalism, and utilitarianism are symptoms of a
- |2
                      “universal Social Gangrene”; England is
- |2
                      “writhing powerless on its fever-bed....” To recreate
- |2
                      something like the organic interdependency of the Middle Ages, Carlyle
- |2
                      advocates hero-worship, “a new body... with a resuscitated
- |2
                      soul” (Past and Present, 1843).
- |2
                  A new development was the application of biological evolution to the study
- |2
                      of political institutions, e.g., in so-called Social Darwinism. Herbert
- |2
                      Spencer's The Principles of Sociology (3 vols.,
- |2
                      1876-96) contains as
- |2
                       many comparisons between natural and politic bodies as anything
- |2
                      from the past. The significant differences are a much greater variety of
- |2
                      bodies and a concern for change from one form to another. A primitive
- |2
                      society evolves into an industrial nation just as a small, simple form of
- |2
                      life becomes a larger, more complex organism. Though the state may
- |2
                      partially resemble a living being, few modern thinkers are willing to
- |2
                      extend similarity to identity.

               Dictionary of the History of IdeasThe analogy of the body politic is the perception
- |2
                      and elaboration of correspondences between society or the state and
- |2
                      the individual human body. These corre-
- |2
                          spondences may then be applied in a variety of ways in political
- |2
                      analysis or argument. In their simplest form, these arguments assert that
- |2
                      given the organic nature of the state, then certain political structures or
- |2
                      actions are necessarily appropriate. A “natural”
- |2
                      society is one which functions in a manner similar to the human body.
- |2
                      In the history of political philosophy and po-
- |2
                      lemic, the analogy has been applied to many different forms of
- |2
                      government and in support of a variety of particular opinions. In general,
- |2
                      however, these states are hierarchical and authoritarian and the ideas
- |2
                      being supported are conservative, stressing social order and
- |2
                      obedience. There are a number of important excep-
- |2
                          tions. As a strategy of argumentation, moreover, the analogy is
- |2
                      used in many different genres—philosophical treatise, political
- |2
                      exhortation, sermon, poem, or drama. The analogy may appear as an allusive
- |2
                      phrase or it may provide the structure for an extended discussion.
- |2
                      Historically speaking, the analogy was used extensively from the time of
- |2
                      the Greeks to the seventeenth century, when it was effectively challenged
- |2
                      by another analogy, that of the social contract; in the nineteenth
- |2
                      century developments in the study of biological evolution gave new
- |2
                      impetus and application to the analogy.The analogy of the body politic rests on two princi-
- |2
                          ples which were articulated by the Greeks. First, the doctrine
- |2
                      of hylozoism asserts that mind or life perme-
- |2
                      ates the natural world. The individual possesses life or soul or
- |2
                      mind which is in some way identical to thehomonoia which animates, unifies, and directs the
- |2
                      state. This mind is the source of the regularity in nature which makes
- |2
                      possible science, including political sci- ence.
- |2
                      This concept permits discussion of the relative health or sickness of the
- |2
                      body politic and the suggesting of cures, perhaps by a ruler acting as a
- |2
                      physician. The second basic principle asserts that one simple pattern
- |2
                      exists at many levels of being; this pattern is most perfectly manifested
- |2
                      in the human body (Plato,Timaeus 30c). In a variety of accounts, creation
- |2
                      consists of the imposition of this pattern on previously chaotic
- |2
                      matter. Since the citizen, the microcosm, and the larger world of the state
- |2
                      possess an identical life and an iden- tical
- |2
                      physical structure, then more specific description and prescription are
- |2
                      possible.The earliest, though fragmentary, examples of the analogy come from India.
- |2
                      The Rig-Veda (X, 90) con-
- |2
                      tains a hymn describing the creation of four castes—
- |2
                      priests, warriors, shepherds, and servants—from the body of
- |2
                      Purusa, a sacrificial personification of the world-soul. The Mahabharata (XIV, xxii) gives a debate between the
- |2
                      mind and the perceiving organs, the point of which is that human arrogance
- |2
                      comes from an ig- norance of how the members
- |2
                      of society must cooperate.More substantial examples appear in Greek political writers, who
- |2
                      specifically apply the analogy to the polis. Plato
- |2
                      begins the Republic by establishing analogy as a
- |2
                      mode of inquiry: if justice in a state can be defined, then justice in an
- |2
                      individual can also be determined. He then contrasts a simple,
- |2
                      “healthy” society and a
- |2
                      “feverish” one corrupted by luxury. By an extension
- |2
                      of the analogy, the cure for a “festering” society is
- |2
                      not the multiplication of petty laws, but a rigorous transformation of the
- |2
                      state and the individual so that both will exhibit a centralized, rational
- |2
                      control and an appropriate division of labor. In the later Laws (628c ff.) Plato characterizes the highest good
- |2
                      as a peaceful, friendly state, like a healthy body that does not
- |2
                      require medical attention. The organic nature of the state is specifically
- |2
                      enunciated by Aristotle: “Thus the state is by nature clearly
- |2
                      prior to the family and the individual... for example, if the whole body
- |2
                      be destroyed, there will be no foot or hand...” (Politics 1253a). Society, therefore, is a creation
- |2
                      of nature, not of man; man's greatest fulfillment comes from being a
- |2
                      part of the polis.Other Greek writers also used the analogy. Aris-
- |2
                          tophanes sees one function of the comic poet as the difficult
- |2
                      task of curing the diseases of the state (Wasps
- |2
                       650-51). Demosthenes regards Philip of Macedon as an attack of
- |2
                      fever which Athens must resist. Of partic-
- |2
                      ular interest is the Aesopic fable of the belly and the members (Aesopica, ed. B. E. Perry, Urbana, Ill. [1952], No.
- |2
                      130). In its simplest form the fable teaches the cooperative structural
- |2
                      relationship between the gen- erals and
- |2
                      soldiers in an army. The fable is explicitly political in the Roman
- |2
                      tradition (Livy, II, 32) in which Menenius Agrippa ends a plebeian
- |2
                      secession by ex- plaining the nourishment the
- |2
                      belly (Senate) provides for the hands and feet (common people). The
- |2
                      analogy was also applied occasionally to smaller groups; in Xenophon's
- |2
                          Memorabilia (II, iii) Socrates urges recon- ciliation between quarreling
- |2
                      brothers by citing the harmony of pairs of hands, feet, and eyes.After the conquests of Alexander, the city-state was a much less relevant
- |2
                      political unit; by praying forhomonoia between Macedonians and Persians, Alex- ander indicated that the analogy of the
- |2
                      body politic could be applied to the much larger Hellenistic mon- archy or even all mankind. Philo Judaeus
- |2
                      urges accep- tance of personal disaster by
- |2
                      comparing the actions of divine providence to an amputation performed
- |2
                      by a surgeon on a partially diseased body. The writings of the Roman
- |2
                      Stoics contain many passages which argue analogically for the necessity of
- |2
                      subordinating the desires of the individual to the well-being of the
- |2
                      state or humanity. Cicero writes that if each part of the body tries to
- |2
                      appropriate the health of the others, then the body will die; such behavior
- |2
                      in men would be equally destructive (De
- |2
                      officis III, 22). Echoing Plato and Aristotle, Seneca says that
- |2
                      as it is unnatural for the hands to destroy the feet, so the need for
- |2
                      harmony, love, and mutual protection causes mankind to protect
- |2
                      individuals (De ira II, 31).Such statements are the source of one of the most influential uses of the
- |2
                      analogy, Saint Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians: “For as
- |2
                      the body is one, and hath many members... so also is Christ.... And the
- |2
                      eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the
- |2
                      head to the feet, I have no need of you.... Now ye are the body of Christ
- |2
                      and members in partic- ular...” (I
- |2
                      Corinthians 12:12-27). Love (agapē) be- tween the members unifies the body (I
- |2
                      Corinthians 6:15-16). Though some of Paul's language is tradi- tional, the application of the analogy
- |2
                      to the followers of Christ is a significant departure, which contains
- |2
                      the radical implication that faith determines the body of which a man
- |2
                      is a part. In the early Church, Paul's words were frequently quoted in
- |2
                      admonitions against dissension and factionalism (e.g., Saint Basil's
- |2
                      Letters 66, 203, 222). Saint Augustine occasionally describes the
- |2
                      Cities of God and Man as bodies, but his emphasis is on the concept of a
- |2
                      mystical body of the faithful,In the Middle Ages the analogy of the body was developed substantially. Most
- |2
                      previous applications had been rather brief; medieval authors extend it
- "                    in elaborate, sometimes fantastic detail. Though its influ-
  ence on the West is uncertain, the tenth-century \n"
- |2
                          Ency- clopedia
- |2
                       of the Arabic Brotherhood of Sincerity uses organic analogies at
- |2
                      great length: the human body is compared to a city and a kingdom; the
- |2
                      senses are to the soul as counsellors to a king, and so on. Among
- |2
                      Christian writers the analogy is used for a variety of purposes. Most
- |2
                      simply, it appears in devotional litera- ture
- |2
                      to explain charity, grace, or some other aspect of doctrine. It could
- |2
                      supplement the concept of the three estates: clergy-eyes-guidance, nobility-hands- defense,
- |2
                      peasants-feet-agriculture. John of Salisbury'sPolicraticus (1159) adopts for its structure a
- |2
                      substantial comparison of the human body and a kingdom. After
- |2
                      identifying the soul and the clergy, John discusses in detail the other
- |2
                      members of the body: head-prince, heart-senate, hands-soldiers,
- |2
                      stomach-treasury, and feet-farmers. He emphasizes the need for spiritual
- |2
                      unity in the state and proposes cures for various political diseases,
- |2
                      including tyranny. The fable of the belly explains and defends systems of
- |2
                      taxation.The Church developed Paul's words about the body of Christ to explain the
- |2
                      structure and importance of ecclesiastical institutions. The Church becomes
- |2
                          corpus mysticum et politicum of which the
- |2
                      Pope is the head, kings and emperors but members. Organic analogies
- |2
                      buttress both sides of the period's most profound polit- ical controversies. Saint Thomas Aquinas finds four
- |2
                      points of identity which unify both natural and mysti-
- |2
                          cal bodies, and asserts that the supremacy of the spirit- ual authority corresponds to the soul's
- |2
                      rule of the body. There are three responses to such claims: to
- |2
                      proclaim the importance of some other organ, such as the heart, with
- |2
                      which a king may be equated; to define the state as a body distinct from
- |2
                      the body of the Church; or to deny the importance of the papacy by claiming
- |2
                      that only Christ is the head of the Church. In the late Middle Ages
- |2
                      the second alternative, an extension of the idea of a “mystical
- |2
                      body,” is a convenient illus-
- |2
                      tration of the growing self-consciousness of the national states.
- |2
                      Sir John Fortescue's De laudibus legum
- |2
                      Angliae (ca. 1470) says that a body politic, specifically
- |2
                      England, is a corpus mysticum; the laws are
- |2
                      the nerves which unite the body and public spirit is the life-giving
- |2
                      blood. An example of the third alternative is Henry VIII's assumption
- |2
                      of the title “Supreme Head of the Church in England.”In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the anal-
- |2
                      ogy persisted as part of the period's vigorous medieval
- |2
                       heritage, but at the same time other ideas developed which
- |2
                      effectively challenged the validity of the anal-
- |2
                      ogy. The three main questions to which the analogy was applied are
- |2
                      the nature of the Church, the nature of the state, and the relationship of
- |2
                      the two. Theolo- gians and polemicists had
- |2
                      much to say about the effect of the Reformation on the body of the Church.
- |2
                      Kings and popes competed for the title “head,” and
- |2
                      they denied that each other's institutions could be described by
- |2
                      organic analogies.Secular rulers invoked the analogy repeatedly to enforce conformity and at
- |2
                      least passive obedience. Even in matters of religion, the word of the
- |2
                      prince had to be followed; rebellion in the state was as un- natural as internal conflict in a body. The ElizabethanHomily Against Disobedience claims that for a
- |2
                      subject to judge a ruler is impiety, “as though the foot
- |2
                      must judge of the head....” At a more perceptive level, the
- |2
                      analogy became a vehicle for social criticism. Thomas Starkey's Dialogue between Pole and Lupset, early in the
- |2
                      sixteenth century, catalogues diseases or imbalances in the four humors as
- |2
                      a structure for discus- sing political and
- |2
                      economic abuses and proposing rem- edies. A few
- |2
                      more radical applications appeared, as in John Milton's Of Reformation in England (1641), which transforms the old fable
- |2
                      of the belly to attack the episcopacy as a cancerous wen.Shakespeare's Coriolanus is perhaps the most
- |2
                      thoughtful consideration of the applicability of organic analogies in
- |2
                      politics. In the first scene, derived from Livy and Plutarch, Menenius
- |2
                      recounts the fable of the belly in a partially successful attempt to calm a
- |2
                      rioting mob. Organic imagery recurs frequently through the play as the
- |2
                      characters attempt to define the suitability of the proud protagonist. The
- |2
                      action shows that the Senate is not a generous nourisher of the state,
- |2
                      the plebeians are not docile workers; Coriolanus vigorously denies any
- |2
                      unity, organic or otherwise, with the lower classes. The distinction of
- |2
                      Shakespeare's play is that it dramatizes the gap between the ideal
- |2
                      commonwealth suggested by the idea of a body politic, and the politi- cal behavior of men. In some instances
- |2
                      the familiar analogy appears to be little more than a pious fraud
- |2
                      perpetrated by ruthless aristocrats.The doubts Shakespeare raises about the validity of the analogy are part of
- |2
                      a larger process of questioning and substitution. Some writers
- |2
                      differentiated the bodies as politic and natural; Fernando Vasquez observes
- |2
                      that in a man a limb cannot change its position, no other part can
- |2
                      become the head, authority always resides in the head, and the death of the
- |2
                      head always causes the death of the body—but none of these is
- |2
                      true of the body politic (Controversarium III). Hugo
- |2
                      Grotius made a similar distinction by pointing out the contractualTo this increasing general skepticism must be added two very significant
- |2
                      factors which essentially destroyed the traditional analogy. The first is
- |2
                      the new science which undercut the basic premisses. Materialism re- placed hylozoism. The pattern which permitted
- |2
                          struc- tural correspondences could be
- |2
                      dismissed as the vain attempt of men to find order where none in fact
- |2
                      existed. The analogy of the body politic exemplifies the Baco- nian Idols which obstruct scientific
- |2
                      inquiry.Secondly, the concept of a body politic was effec-
- |2
                          tively replaced by the old, but not widely popular, idea of a
- |2
                      social contract. For Calvin and his followers the Church as mystical body
- |2
                      was supplemented by a great emphasis on a covenant, modeled on the one
- |2
                      between God and Abraham. These theories of covenant and contract view
- |2
                      church and state as artificial institutions, created by an act of will of
- |2
                      their individual members and subject to change by them. The new
- |2
                      analogy attempts definition in terms of origin, for which organic
- |2
                      analogies seemed deficient. A striking fusion of the two traditions is
- |2
                      Hobbes' statement (in Leviathan, Part I,
- |2
                      Introduction) that the state is an artificial body, a machine assembled by
- |2
                      man. More typical of the transi- tion are
- |2
                      these words from the Mayflower Compact (1620): “We... covenant
- |2
                      and combine ourselves to- gether into a Civil
- |2
                      Body Politike....” The main point is the combining;
- |2
                      “Body Politike” is simply a synonym for
- |2
                      “political entity” with no further analogical mean- ings intended.For the last three centuries extended organic analo-
- |2
                          gies have been generally absent from discussions of political
- |2
                      issues. The phrase “body politic” persists, but as a
- |2
                      dead metaphor rather than a meaningful concept for analysis or argument.
- |2
                      Two types of exceptions may be cited from the nineteenth century. First,
- |2
                      there was a moderate amount of imagery used to characterize the
- |2
                      Industrial Revolution and an ideal alternative which might exist in the
- |2
                      future or the medieval past. Thomas Carlyle writes in Sartor Resartus (1833) that government is the
- |2
                      “outward Skin of the Body
- |2
                      Politic,” binding and protecting its constituent parts; the
- |2
                          vivify- ing nervous system is religion.
- |2
                      Mechanism, capitalism, and utilitarianism are symptoms of a
- |2
                      “universal Social Gangrene”; England is
- |2
                      “writhing powerless on its fever-bed....” To recreate
- |2
                      something like the organic interdependency of the Middle Ages, Carlyle
- |2
                      advocates hero-worship, “a new body... with a resuscitated
- |2
                      soul” (Past and Present, 1843).A new development was the application of biological evolution to the study
- |2
                      of political institutions, e.g., in so-called Social Darwinism. Herbert
- |2
                      Spencer's The Principles of Sociology (3 vols.,
- |2
                      1876-96) contains as
- |2
                       many comparisons between natural and politic bodies as anything
- |2
                      from the past. The significant differences are a much greater variety of
- |2
                      bodies and a concern for change from one form to another. A primitive
- |2
                      society evolves into an industrial nation just as a small, simple form of
- |2
                      life becomes a larger, more complex organism. Though the state may
- |2
                      partially resemble a living being, few modern thinkers are willing to
- |2
                      extend similarity to identity.There is no comprehensive discussion of the topic. Various aspects are

  \               ANALOGY OF THEBODY POLITIC\n                The analogy of the body
  politic is the perception\n                    and elaboration of correspondences
  between society or the state and\n                    the individual human body.
  These corre-\n                        spondences may then be applied in a variety
  of ways in political\n                    analysis or argument. In their simplest
  form, these arguments assert that\n                    given the organic nature
  of the state, then certain political structures or\n                    actions
  are necessarily appropriate. A “natural”\n                    society is one which
  functions in a manner similar to the human body.\n                    In the history
  of political philosophy and po-\n                    lemic, the analogy has been
  applied to many different forms of\n                    government and in support
  of a variety of particular opinions. In general,\n                    however, these
  states are hierarchical and authoritarian and the ideas\n                    being
  supported are conservative, stressing social order and\n                    obedience.
  There are a number of important excep-\n                        tions. As a strategy
  of argumentation, moreover, the analogy is\n                    used in many different
  genres—philosophical treatise, political\n                    exhortation, sermon,
  poem, or drama. The analogy may appear as an allusive\n                    phrase
  or it may provide the structure for an extended discussion.\n                    Historically
  speaking, the analogy was used extensively from the time of\n                    the
  Greeks to the seventeenth century, when it was effectively challenged\n                    by
  another analogy, that of the social contract; in the nineteenth\n                    century
  developments in the study of biological evolution gave new\n                    impetus
  and application to the analogy.\n                068\n                \n                The
  analogy of the body politic rests on two princi-\n                        ples which
  were articulated by the Greeks. First, the doctrine\n                    of hylozoism
  asserts that mind or life perme-\n                    ates the natural world. The
  individual possesses life or soul or\n                    mind which is in some
  way identical to thehomonoia which animates, unifies, and directs the\n                    state.
  This mind is the source of the regularity in nature which makes\n                    possible
  science, including political sci- ence.\n                    This concept permits
  discussion of the relative health or sickness of the\n                    body politic
  and the suggesting of cures, perhaps by a ruler acting as a\n                    physician.
  The second basic principle asserts that one simple pattern\n                    exists
  at many levels of being; this pattern is most perfectly manifested\n                    in
  the human body (Plato,Timaeus 30c). In a variety of accounts, creation\n                    consists
  of the imposition of this pattern on previously chaotic\n                    matter.
  Since the citizen, the microcosm, and the larger world of the state\n                    possess
  an identical life and an iden- tical\n                    physical structure, then
  more specific description and prescription are\n                    possible.\n
  \               The earliest, though fragmentary, examples of the analogy come from
  India.\n                    The Rig-Veda (X, 90) con-\n                    tains
  a hymn describing the creation of four castes—\n                    priests, warriors,
  shepherds, and servants—from the body of\n                    Purusa, a sacrificial
  personification of the world-soul. The Mahabharata (XIV, xxii) gives a debate between
  the\n                    mind and the perceiving organs, the point of which is that
  human arrogance\n                    comes from an ig- norance of how the members\n
  \                   of society must cooperate.\n                More substantial
  examples appear in Greek political writers, who\n                    specifically
  apply the analogy to the polis. Plato\n                    begins the Republic by
  establishing analogy as a\n                    mode of inquiry: if justice in a
  state can be defined, then justice in an\n                    individual can also
  be determined. He then contrasts a simple,\n                    “healthy” society
  and a\n                    “feverish” one corrupted by luxury. By an extension\n
  \                   of the analogy, the cure for a “festering” society is\n                    not
  the multiplication of petty laws, but a rigorous transformation of the\n                    state
  and the individual so that both will exhibit a centralized, rational\n                    control
  and an appropriate division of labor. In the later Laws (628c ff.) Plato characterizes
  the highest good\n                    as a peaceful, friendly state, like a healthy
  body that does not\n                    require medical attention. The organic nature
  of the state is specifically\n                    enunciated by Aristotle: “Thus
  the state is by nature clearly\n                    prior to the family and the
  individual... for example, if the whole body\n                    be destroyed,
  there will be no foot or hand...” (Politics 1253a). Society, therefore, is a creation\n
  \                   of nature, not of man; man's greatest fulfillment comes from
  being a\n                    part of the polis.\n                Other Greek writers
  also used the analogy. Aris-\n                        tophanes sees one function
  of the comic poet as the difficult\n                    task of curing the diseases
  of the state (Wasps\n                     650-51). Demosthenes regards Philip of
  Macedon as an attack of\n                    fever which Athens must resist. Of
  partic-\n                    ular interest is the Aesopic fable of the belly and
  the members (Aesopica, ed. B. E. Perry, Urbana, Ill. [1952], No.\n                    130).
  In its simplest form the fable teaches the cooperative structural\n                    relationship
  between the gen- erals and\n                    soldiers in an army. The fable is
  explicitly political in the Roman\n                    tradition (Livy, II, 32)
  in which Menenius Agrippa ends a plebeian\n                    secession by ex-
  plaining the nourishment the\n                    belly (Senate) provides for the
  hands and feet (common people). The\n                    analogy was also applied
  occasionally to smaller groups; in Xenophon's\n                        Memorabilia
  (II, iii) Socrates urges recon- ciliation between quarreling\n                    brothers
  by citing the harmony of pairs of hands, feet, and eyes.\n                After
  the conquests of Alexander, the city-state was a much less relevant\n                    political
  unit; by praying forhomonoia between Macedonians and Persians, Alex- ander indicated
  that the analogy of the\n                    body politic could be applied to the
  much larger Hellenistic mon- archy or even all mankind. Philo Judaeus\n                    urges
  accep- tance of personal disaster by\n                    comparing the actions
  of divine providence to an amputation performed\n                    by a surgeon
  on a partially diseased body. The writings of the Roman\n                    Stoics
  contain many passages which argue analogically for the necessity of\n                    subordinating
  the desires of the individual to the well-being of the\n                    state
  or humanity. Cicero writes that if each part of the body tries to\n                    appropriate
  the health of the others, then the body will die; such behavior\n                    in
  men would be equally destructive (De\n                    officis III, 22). Echoing
  Plato and Aristotle, Seneca says that\n                    as it is unnatural for
  the hands to destroy the feet, so the need for\n                    harmony, love,
  and mutual protection causes mankind to protect\n                    individuals
  (De ira II, 31).\n                Such statements are the source of one of the most
  influential uses of the\n                    analogy, Saint Paul's first epistle
  to the Corinthians: “For as\n                    the body is one, and hath many
  members... so also is Christ.... And the\n                    eye cannot say unto
  the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the\n                    head to the
  feet, I have no need of you.... Now ye are the body of Christ\n                    and
  members in partic- ular...” (I\n                    Corinthians 12:12-27). Love
  (agapē) be- tween the members unifies the body (I\n                    Corinthians
  6:15-16). Though some of Paul's language is tradi- tional, the application of the
  analogy\n                    to the followers of Christ is a significant departure,
  which contains\n                    the radical implication that faith determines
  the body of which a man\n                    is a part. In the early Church, Paul's
  words were frequently quoted in\n                    admonitions against dissension
  and factionalism (e.g., Saint Basil's\n                    Letters 66, 203, 222).
  Saint Augustine occasionally describes the\n                    Cities of God and
  Man as bodies, but his emphasis is on the concept of a\n                    mystical
  body of the faithful,069\n                     united by having sacramentally eaten
  the body of Christ.\n                In the Middle Ages the analogy of the body
  was developed substantially. Most\n                    previous applications had
  been rather brief; medieval authors extend it\n                    in elaborate,
  sometimes fantastic detail. Though its influ- ence on the West is uncertain, the
  tenth-century \n                        Ency- clopedia\n                     of
  the Arabic Brotherhood of Sincerity uses organic analogies at\n                    great
  length: the human body is compared to a city and a kingdom; the\n                    senses
  are to the soul as counsellors to a king, and so on. Among\n                    Christian
  writers the analogy is used for a variety of purposes. Most\n                    simply,
  it appears in devotional litera- ture\n                    to explain charity, grace,
  or some other aspect of doctrine. It could\n                    supplement the concept
  of the three estates: clergy-eyes-guidance, nobility-hands- defense,\n                    peasants-feet-agriculture.
  John of Salisbury'sPolicraticus (1159) adopts for its structure a\n                    substantial
  comparison of the human body and a kingdom. After\n                    identifying
  the soul and the clergy, John discusses in detail the other\n                    members
  of the body: head-prince, heart-senate, hands-soldiers,\n                    stomach-treasury,
  and feet-farmers. He emphasizes the need for spiritual\n                    unity
  in the state and proposes cures for various political diseases,\n                    including
  tyranny. The fable of the belly explains and defends systems of\n                    taxation.\n
  \               The Church developed Paul's words about the body of Christ to explain
  the\n                    structure and importance of ecclesiastical institutions.
  The Church becomes\n                        corpus mysticum et politicum of which
  the\n                    Pope is the head, kings and emperors but members. Organic
  analogies\n                    buttress both sides of the period's most profound
  polit- ical controversies. Saint Thomas Aquinas finds four\n                    points
  of identity which unify both natural and mysti-\n                        cal bodies,
  and asserts that the supremacy of the spirit- ual authority corresponds to the soul's\n
  \                   rule of the body. There are three responses to such claims:
  to\n                    proclaim the importance of some other organ, such as the
  heart, with\n                    which a king may be equated; to define the state
  as a body distinct from\n                    the body of the Church; or to deny
  the importance of the papacy by claiming\n                    that only Christ is
  the head of the Church. In the late Middle Ages\n                    the second
  alternative, an extension of the idea of a “mystical\n                    body,”
  is a convenient illus-\n                    tration of the growing self-consciousness
  of the national states.\n                    Sir John Fortescue's De laudibus legum\n
  \                   Angliae (ca. 1470) says that a body politic, specifically\n
  \                   England, is a corpus mysticum; the laws are\n                    the
  nerves which unite the body and public spirit is the life-giving\n                    blood.
  An example of the third alternative is Henry VIII's assumption\n                    of
  the title “Supreme Head of the Church in England.”\n                In the sixteenth
  and seventeenth centuries the anal-\n                    ogy persisted as part of
  the period's vigorous medieval\n                     heritage, but at the same time
  other ideas developed which\n                    effectively challenged the validity
  of the anal-\n                    ogy. The three main questions to which the analogy
  was applied are\n                    the nature of the Church, the nature of the
  state, and the relationship of\n                    the two. Theolo- gians and polemicists
  had\n                    much to say about the effect of the Reformation on the
  body of the Church.\n                    Kings and popes competed for the title
  “head,” and\n                    they denied that each other's institutions could
  be described by\n                    organic analogies.\n                Secular
  rulers invoked the analogy repeatedly to enforce conformity and at\n                    least
  passive obedience. Even in matters of religion, the word of the\n                    prince
  had to be followed; rebellion in the state was as un- natural as internal conflict
  in a body. The ElizabethanHomily Against Disobedience claims that for a\n                    subject
  to judge a ruler is impiety, “as though the foot\n                    must judge
  of the head....” At a more perceptive level, the\n                    analogy became
  a vehicle for social criticism. Thomas Starkey's Dialogue between Pole and Lupset,
  early in the\n                    sixteenth century, catalogues diseases or imbalances
  in the four humors as\n                    a structure for discus- sing political
  and\n                    economic abuses and proposing rem- edies. A few\n                    more
  radical applications appeared, as in John Milton's Of Reformation in England (1641),
  which transforms the old fable\n                    of the belly to attack the episcopacy
  as a cancerous wen.\n                Shakespeare's Coriolanus is perhaps the most\n
  \                   thoughtful consideration of the applicability of organic analogies
  in\n                    politics. In the first scene, derived from Livy and Plutarch,
  Menenius\n                    recounts the fable of the belly in a partially successful
  attempt to calm a\n                    rioting mob. Organic imagery recurs frequently
  through the play as the\n                    characters attempt to define the suitability
  of the proud protagonist. The\n                    action shows that the Senate
  is not a generous nourisher of the state,\n                    the plebeians are
  not docile workers; Coriolanus vigorously denies any\n                    unity,
  organic or otherwise, with the lower classes. The distinction of\n                    Shakespeare's
  play is that it dramatizes the gap between the ideal\n                    commonwealth
  suggested by the idea of a body politic, and the politi- cal behavior of men. In
  some instances\n                    the familiar analogy appears to be little more
  than a pious fraud\n                    perpetrated by ruthless aristocrats.\n                The
  doubts Shakespeare raises about the validity of the analogy are part of\n                    a
  larger process of questioning and substitution. Some writers\n                    differentiated
  the bodies as politic and natural; Fernando Vasquez observes\n                    that
  in a man a limb cannot change its position, no other part can\n                    become
  the head, authority always resides in the head, and the death of the\n                    head
  always causes the death of the body—but none of these is\n                    true
  of the body politic (Controversarium III). Hugo\n                    Grotius made
  a similar distinction by pointing out the contractual070\n                     origin
  of the state and the right of a part to protect itself\n                    by secession
  or other means (De jure II).\n                To this increasing general skepticism
  must be added two very significant\n                    factors which essentially
  destroyed the traditional analogy. The first is\n                    the new science
  which undercut the basic premisses. Materialism re- placed hylozoism. The pattern
  which permitted\n                        struc- tural correspondences could be\n
  \                   dismissed as the vain attempt of men to find order where none
  in fact\n                    existed. The analogy of the body politic exemplifies
  the Baco- nian Idols which obstruct scientific\n                    inquiry.\n                Secondly,
  the concept of a body politic was effec-\n                        tively replaced
  by the old, but not widely popular, idea of a\n                    social contract.
  For Calvin and his followers the Church as mystical body\n                    was
  supplemented by a great emphasis on a covenant, modeled on the one\n                    between
  God and Abraham. These theories of covenant and contract view\n                    church
  and state as artificial institutions, created by an act of will of\n                    their
  individual members and subject to change by them. The new\n                    analogy
  attempts definition in terms of origin, for which organic\n                    analogies
  seemed deficient. A striking fusion of the two traditions is\n                    Hobbes'
  statement (in Leviathan, Part I,\n                    Introduction) that the state
  is an artificial body, a machine assembled by\n                    man. More typical
  of the transi- tion are\n                    these words from the Mayflower Compact
  (1620): “We... covenant\n                    and combine ourselves to- gether into
  a Civil\n                    Body Politike....” The main point is the combining;\n
  \                   “Body Politike” is simply a synonym for\n                    “political
  entity” with no further analogical mean- ings intended.\n                For the
  last three centuries extended organic analo-\n                        gies have
  been generally absent from discussions of political\n                    issues.
  The phrase “body politic” persists, but as a\n                    dead metaphor
  rather than a meaningful concept for analysis or argument.\n                    Two
  types of exceptions may be cited from the nineteenth century. First,\n                    there
  was a moderate amount of imagery used to characterize the\n                    Industrial
  Revolution and an ideal alternative which might exist in the\n                    future
  or the medieval past. Thomas Carlyle writes in Sartor Resartus (1833) that government
  is the\n                    “outward Skin of the Body\n                    Politic,”
  binding and protecting its constituent parts; the\n                        vivify-
  ing nervous system is religion.\n                    Mechanism, capitalism, and
  utilitarianism are symptoms of a\n                    “universal Social Gangrene”;
  England is\n                    “writhing powerless on its fever-bed....” To recreate\n
  \                   something like the organic interdependency of the Middle Ages,
  Carlyle\n                    advocates hero-worship, “a new body... with a resuscitated\n
  \                   soul” (Past and Present, 1843).\n                A new development
  was the application of biological evolution to the study\n                    of
  political institutions, e.g., in so-called Social Darwinism. Herbert\n                    Spencer's
  The Principles of Sociology (3 vols.,\n                    1876-96) contains as\n
  \                    many comparisons between natural and politic bodies as anything\n
  \                   from the past. The significant differences are a much greater
  variety of\n                    bodies and a concern for change from one form to
  another. A primitive\n                    society evolves into an industrial nation
  just as a small, simple form of\n                    life becomes a larger, more
  complex organism. Though the state may\n                    partially resemble a
  living being, few modern thinkers are willing to\n                    extend similarity
  to identity.\n                \n                    \n                        BIBLIOGRAPHY\n

  \               \n             Dictionary of the History of IdeasThe analogy of
  the body politic is the perception\n                    and elaboration of correspondences
  between society or the state and\n                    the individual human body.
  These corre-\n                        spondences may then be applied in a variety
  of ways in political\n                    analysis or argument. In their simplest
  form, these arguments assert that\n                    given the organic nature
  of the state, then certain political structures or\n                    actions
  are necessarily appropriate. A “natural”\n                    society is one which
  functions in a manner similar to the human body.\n                    In the history
  of political philosophy and po-\n                    lemic, the analogy has been
  applied to many different forms of\n                    government and in support
  of a variety of particular opinions. In general,\n                    however, these
  states are hierarchical and authoritarian and the ideas\n                    being
  supported are conservative, stressing social order and\n                    obedience.
  There are a number of important excep-\n                        tions. As a strategy
  of argumentation, moreover, the analogy is\n                    used in many different
  genres—philosophical treatise, political\n                    exhortation, sermon,
  poem, or drama. The analogy may appear as an allusive\n                    phrase
  or it may provide the structure for an extended discussion.\n                    Historically
  speaking, the analogy was used extensively from the time of\n                    the
  Greeks to the seventeenth century, when it was effectively challenged\n                    by
  another analogy, that of the social contract; in the nineteenth\n                    century
  developments in the study of biological evolution gave new\n                    impetus
  and application to the analogy.The analogy of the body politic rests on two princi-\n
  \                       ples which were articulated by the Greeks. First, the doctrine\n
  \                   of hylozoism asserts that mind or life perme-\n                    ates
  the natural world. The individual possesses life or soul or\n                    mind
  which is in some way identical to thehomonoia which animates, unifies, and directs
  the\n                    state. This mind is the source of the regularity in nature
  which makes\n                    possible science, including political sci- ence.\n
  \                   This concept permits discussion of the relative health or sickness
  of the\n                    body politic and the suggesting of cures, perhaps by
  a ruler acting as a\n                    physician. The second basic principle asserts
  that one simple pattern\n                    exists at many levels of being; this
  pattern is most perfectly manifested\n                    in the human body (Plato,Timaeus
  30c). In a variety of accounts, creation\n                    consists of the imposition
  of this pattern on previously chaotic\n                    matter. Since the citizen,
  the microcosm, and the larger world of the state\n                    possess an
  identical life and an iden- tical\n                    physical structure, then
  more specific description and prescription are\n                    possible.The
  earliest, though fragmentary, examples of the analogy come from India.\n                    The
  Rig-Veda (X, 90) con-\n                    tains a hymn describing the creation
  of four castes—\n                    priests, warriors, shepherds, and servants—from
  the body of\n                    Purusa, a sacrificial personification of the world-soul.
  The Mahabharata (XIV, xxii) gives a debate between the\n                    mind
  and the perceiving organs, the point of which is that human arrogance\n                    comes
  from an ig- norance of how the members\n                    of society must cooperate.More
  substantial examples appear in Greek political writers, who\n                    specifically
  apply the analogy to the polis. Plato\n                    begins the Republic by
  establishing analogy as a\n                    mode of inquiry: if justice in a
  state can be defined, then justice in an\n                    individual can also
  be determined. He then contrasts a simple,\n                    “healthy” society
  and a\n                    “feverish” one corrupted by luxury. By an extension\n
  \                   of the analogy, the cure for a “festering” society is\n                    not
  the multiplication of petty laws, but a rigorous transformation of the\n                    state
  and the individual so that both will exhibit a centralized, rational\n                    control
  and an appropriate division of labor. In the later Laws (628c ff.) Plato characterizes
  the highest good\n                    as a peaceful, friendly state, like a healthy
  body that does not\n                    require medical attention. The organic nature
  of the state is specifically\n                    enunciated by Aristotle: “Thus
  the state is by nature clearly\n                    prior to the family and the
  individual... for example, if the whole body\n                    be destroyed,
  there will be no foot or hand...” (Politics 1253a). Society, therefore, is a creation\n
  \                   of nature, not of man; man's greatest fulfillment comes from
  being a\n                    part of the polis.Other Greek writers also used the
  analogy. Aris-\n                        tophanes sees one function of the comic
  poet as the difficult\n                    task of curing the diseases of the state
  (Wasps\n                     650-51). Demosthenes regards Philip of Macedon as an
  attack of\n                    fever which Athens must resist. Of partic-\n                    ular
  interest is the Aesopic fable of the belly and the members (Aesopica, ed. B. E.
  Perry, Urbana, Ill. [1952], No.\n                    130). In its simplest form
  the fable teaches the cooperative structural\n                    relationship between
  the gen- erals and\n                    soldiers in an army. The fable is explicitly
  political in the Roman\n                    tradition (Livy, II, 32) in which Menenius
  Agrippa ends a plebeian\n                    secession by ex- plaining the nourishment
  the\n                    belly (Senate) provides for the hands and feet (common
  people). The\n                    analogy was also applied occasionally to smaller
  groups; in Xenophon's\n                        Memorabilia (II, iii) Socrates urges
  recon- ciliation between quarreling\n                    brothers by citing the
  harmony of pairs of hands, feet, and eyes.After the conquests of Alexander, the
  city-state was a much less relevant\n                    political unit; by praying
  forhomonoia between Macedonians and Persians, Alex- ander indicated that the analogy
  of the\n                    body politic could be applied to the much larger Hellenistic
  mon- archy or even all mankind. Philo Judaeus\n                    urges accep-
  tance of personal disaster by\n                    comparing the actions of divine
  providence to an amputation performed\n                    by a surgeon on a partially
  diseased body. The writings of the Roman\n                    Stoics contain many
  passages which argue analogically for the necessity of\n                    subordinating
  the desires of the individual to the well-being of the\n                    state
  or humanity. Cicero writes that if each part of the body tries to\n                    appropriate
  the health of the others, then the body will die; such behavior\n                    in
  men would be equally destructive (De\n                    officis III, 22). Echoing
  Plato and Aristotle, Seneca says that\n                    as it is unnatural for
  the hands to destroy the feet, so the need for\n                    harmony, love,
  and mutual protection causes mankind to protect\n                    individuals
  (De ira II, 31).Such statements are the source of one of the most influential uses
  of the\n                    analogy, Saint Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians:
  “For as\n                    the body is one, and hath many members... so also is
  Christ.... And the\n                    eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no
  need of thee: nor again the\n                    head to the feet, I have no need
  of you.... Now ye are the body of Christ\n                    and members in partic-
  ular...” (I\n                    Corinthians 12:12-27). Love (agapē) be- tween the
  members unifies the body (I\n                    Corinthians 6:15-16). Though some
  of Paul's language is tradi- tional, the application of the analogy\n                    to
  the followers of Christ is a significant departure, which contains\n                    the
  radical implication that faith determines the body of which a man\n                    is
  a part. In the early Church, Paul's words were frequently quoted in\n                    admonitions
  against dissension and factionalism (e.g., Saint Basil's\n                    Letters
  66, 203, 222). Saint Augustine occasionally describes the\n                    Cities
  of God and Man as bodies, but his emphasis is on the concept of a\n                    mystical
  body of the faithful,In the Middle Ages the analogy of the body was developed substantially.
  Most\n                    previous applications had been rather brief; medieval
  authors extend it\n                    in elaborate, sometimes fantastic detail.
  Though its influ- ence on the West is uncertain, the tenth-century \n                        Ency-
  clopedia\n                     of the Arabic Brotherhood of Sincerity uses organic
  analogies at\n                    great length: the human body is compared to a
  city and a kingdom; the\n                    senses are to the soul as counsellors
  to a king, and so on. Among\n                    Christian writers the analogy is
  used for a variety of purposes. Most\n                    simply, it appears in
  devotional litera- ture\n                    to explain charity, grace, or some
  other aspect of doctrine. It could\n                    supplement the concept of
  the three estates: clergy-eyes-guidance, nobility-hands- defense,\n                    peasants-feet-agriculture.
  John of Salisbury'sPolicraticus (1159) adopts for its structure a\n                    substantial
  comparison of the human body and a kingdom. After\n                    identifying
  the soul and the clergy, John discusses in detail the other\n                    members
  of the body: head-prince, heart-senate, hands-soldiers,\n                    stomach-treasury,
  and feet-farmers. He emphasizes the need for spiritual\n                    unity
  in the state and proposes cures for various political diseases,\n                    including
  tyranny. The fable of the belly explains and defends systems of\n                    taxation.The
  Church developed Paul's words about the body of Christ to explain the\n                    structure
  and importance of ecclesiastical institutions. The Church becomes\n                        corpus
  mysticum et politicum of which the\n                    Pope is the head, kings
  and emperors but members. Organic analogies\n                    buttress both sides
  of the period's most profound polit- ical controversies. Saint Thomas Aquinas finds
  four\n                    points of identity which unify both natural and mysti-\n
  \                       cal bodies, and asserts that the supremacy of the spirit-
  ual authority corresponds to the soul's\n                    rule of the body. There
  are three responses to such claims: to\n                    proclaim the importance
  of some other organ, such as the heart, with\n                    which a king may
  be equated; to define the state as a body distinct from\n                    the
  body of the Church; or to deny the importance of the papacy by claiming\n                    that
  only Christ is the head of the Church. In the late Middle Ages\n                    the
  second alternative, an extension of the idea of a “mystical\n                    body,”
  is a convenient illus-\n                    tration of the growing self-consciousness
  of the national states.\n                    Sir John Fortescue's De laudibus legum\n
  \                   Angliae (ca. 1470) says that a body politic, specifically\n
  \                   England, is a corpus mysticum; the laws are\n                    the
  nerves which unite the body and public spirit is the life-giving\n                    blood.
  An example of the third alternative is Henry VIII's assumption\n                    of
  the title “Supreme Head of the Church in England.”In the sixteenth and seventeenth
  centuries the anal-\n                    ogy persisted as part of the period's vigorous
  medieval\n                     heritage, but at the same time other ideas developed
  which\n                    effectively challenged the validity of the anal-\n                    ogy.
  The three main questions to which the analogy was applied are\n                    the
  nature of the Church, the nature of the state, and the relationship of\n                    the
  two. Theolo- gians and polemicists had\n                    much to say about the
  effect of the Reformation on the body of the Church.\n                    Kings
  and popes competed for the title “head,” and\n                    they denied that
  each other's institutions could be described by\n                    organic analogies.Secular
  rulers invoked the analogy repeatedly to enforce conformity and at\n                    least
  passive obedience. Even in matters of religion, the word of the\n                    prince
  had to be followed; rebellion in the state was as un- natural as internal conflict
  in a body. The ElizabethanHomily Against Disobedience claims that for a\n                    subject
  to judge a ruler is impiety, “as though the foot\n                    must judge
  of the head....” At a more perceptive level, the\n                    analogy became
  a vehicle for social criticism. Thomas Starkey's Dialogue between Pole and Lupset,
  early in the\n                    sixteenth century, catalogues diseases or imbalances
  in the four humors as\n                    a structure for discus- sing political
  and\n                    economic abuses and proposing rem- edies. A few\n                    more
  radical applications appeared, as in John Milton's Of Reformation in England (1641),
  which transforms the old fable\n                    of the belly to attack the episcopacy
  as a cancerous wen.Shakespeare's Coriolanus is perhaps the most\n                    thoughtful
  consideration of the applicability of organic analogies in\n                    politics.
  In the first scene, derived from Livy and Plutarch, Menenius\n                    recounts
  the fable of the belly in a partially successful attempt to calm a\n                    rioting
  mob. Organic imagery recurs frequently through the play as the\n                    characters
  attempt to define the suitability of the proud protagonist. The\n                    action
  shows that the Senate is not a generous nourisher of the state,\n                    the
  plebeians are not docile workers; Coriolanus vigorously denies any\n                    unity,
  organic or otherwise, with the lower classes. The distinction of\n                    Shakespeare's
  play is that it dramatizes the gap between the ideal\n                    commonwealth
  suggested by the idea of a body politic, and the politi- cal behavior of men. In
  some instances\n                    the familiar analogy appears to be little more
  than a pious fraud\n                    perpetrated by ruthless aristocrats.The
  doubts Shakespeare raises about the validity of the analogy are part of\n                    a
  larger process of questioning and substitution. Some writers\n                    differentiated
  the bodies as politic and natural; Fernando Vasquez observes\n                    that
  in a man a limb cannot change its position, no other part can\n                    become
  the head, authority always resides in the head, and the death of the\n                    head
  always causes the death of the body—but none of these is\n                    true
  of the body politic (Controversarium III). Hugo\n                    Grotius made
  a similar distinction by pointing out the contractualTo this increasing general
  skepticism must be added two very significant\n                    factors which
  essentially destroyed the traditional analogy. The first is\n                    the
  new science which undercut the basic premisses. Materialism re- placed hylozoism.
  The pattern which permitted\n                        struc- tural correspondences
  could be\n                    dismissed as the vain attempt of men to find order
  where none in fact\n                    existed. The analogy of the body politic
  exemplifies the Baco- nian Idols which obstruct scientific\n                    inquiry.Secondly,
  the concept of a body politic was effec-\n                        tively replaced
  by the old, but not widely popular, idea of a\n                    social contract.
  For Calvin and his followers the Church as mystical body\n                    was
  supplemented by a great emphasis on a covenant, modeled on the one\n                    between
  God and Abraham. These theories of covenant and contract view\n                    church
  and state as artificial institutions, created by an act of will of\n                    their
  individual members and subject to change by them. The new\n                    analogy
  attempts definition in terms of origin, for which organic\n                    analogies
  seemed deficient. A striking fusion of the two traditions is\n                    Hobbes'
  statement (in Leviathan, Part I,\n                    Introduction) that the state
  is an artificial body, a machine assembled by\n                    man. More typical
  of the transi- tion are\n                    these words from the Mayflower Compact
  (1620): “We... covenant\n                    and combine ourselves to- gether into
  a Civil\n                    Body Politike....” The main point is the combining;\n
  \                   “Body Politike” is simply a synonym for\n                    “political
  entity” with no further analogical mean- ings intended.For the last three centuries
  extended organic analo-\n                        gies have been generally absent
  from discussions of political\n                    issues. The phrase “body politic”
  persists, but as a\n                    dead metaphor rather than a meaningful concept
  for analysis or argument.\n                    Two types of exceptions may be cited
  from the nineteenth century. First,\n                    there was a moderate amount
  of imagery used to characterize the\n                    Industrial Revolution and
  an ideal alternative which might exist in the\n                    future or the
  medieval past. Thomas Carlyle writes in Sartor Resartus (1833) that government is
  the\n                    “outward Skin of the Body\n                    Politic,”
  binding and protecting its constituent parts; the\n                        vivify-
  ing nervous system is religion.\n                    Mechanism, capitalism, and
  utilitarianism are symptoms of a\n                    “universal Social Gangrene”;
  England is\n                    “writhing powerless on its fever-bed....” To recreate\n
  \                   something like the organic interdependency of the Middle Ages,
  Carlyle\n                    advocates hero-worship, “a new body... with a resuscitated\n
  \                   soul” (Past and Present, 1843).A new development was the application
  of biological evolution to the study\n                    of political institutions,
  e.g., in so-called Social Darwinism. Herbert\n                    Spencer's The
  Principles of Sociology (3 vols.,\n                    1876-96) contains as\n                     many
  comparisons between natural and politic bodies as anything\n                    from
  the past. The significant differences are a much greater variety of\n                    bodies
  and a concern for change from one form to another. A primitive\n                    society
  evolves into an industrial nation just as a small, simple form of\n                    life
  becomes a larger, more complex organism. Though the state may\n                    partially
  resemble a living being, few modern thinkers are willing to\n                    extend
  similarity to identity.There is no comprehensive discussion of the topic. Various
  aspects are\n                        treated in R. Allers, “Microcosmus from Anaximandros
  to\n                        Paracelsus,” Traditio,\n                        2 (1944),
