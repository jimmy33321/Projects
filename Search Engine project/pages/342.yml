  Global inequality: How the U.S. compares
- |2+

- |
  By Drew DeSilver9 comments
- |2+

- "\t\tWith more attention being paid to economic inequality in the United States,
  it’s also worth looking at how the nation compares globally. As it happens, the
  U.S. has one of the most unequal income distributions in the developed world, according
  to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — even after
  taxes and social-welfare policies are taken into account.\n"
- |
  Income, of course, isn’t the only way to measure economic inequality, but it is the most common, especially when making cross-national comparisons. Income inequality often is expressed in terms of the Gini index, a summary statistic that measures the dispersion of incomes on a scale of zero (everyone has exactly the same income) to 1 (one person has all the income).
- |
  The OECD, a group of 34 mostly developed economies, calculates Gini coefficients for most of its member countries, both before and after taxes and transfer payments. That helps address criticism from some economists that income-based measures of inequality ignore the redistributive impact of such programs as Social Security, the earned income tax credit and unemployment insurance. (We looked at the 31 OECD countries that had both sets of Gini scores for a reasonably recent year, in most cases 2010.)
- |
  Before accounting for taxes and transfers, the U.S. ranked 10th in income inequality; among the countries with more unequal income distributions were France, the U.K. and Ireland. But after taking taxes and transfers into account, the U.S. had the second-highest level of inequality, behind only Chile. (Mexico and Brazil had higher after-tax/transfer Gini scores, but no “before” scores with which to compare them; including them would push the U.S. down to fourth place.)
- |
  It’s not that taxes and social-insurance policies in the U.S. have no redistributive effect. Before taxes and transfers, according to a new Congressional Budget Office report, the bottom 20% of Americans had 2.3% of all income, while the top 20% had 57.9%. After taxes and transfers, the bottom 20%’s share rose to 9.3%, while the top 20%’s share fell to 47.2%. (Thanks to The New York Times’ Economix blog for the chart below).

- |
  However, the OECD data show that U.S. tax and spending policy does relatively little, compared with its peers in the developed world, to reduce inequality (a point made elsewhere using a similar dataset). Among the 31 OECD countries for which recent “before” and “after” Gini scores are available, the average differential was 0.163; for the U.S. the differential was 0.119. The country where tax and transfer policies do the most to reduce income inequality? Ireland, which ranked highest before taxes and transfers but 10th after.

  The fact is, roughly 25% of the working class make so little, they not only qualify for Government assistance, but require it to supplement their low income (www.compareyourcountry.org/employment-outlook?cr=oecd&cr1=oecd&lg=en&page=2)
- |
  Working families were the biggest beneficiaries of federal programs aimed at the poor in all but six states.
- |
  (www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/business/economy/working-but-needing-public-assistance-anyway.html)
- |
  Walmart employees make so little, it cost taxpayers $6.2 billion in public assistance.
- |
  (www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2014/04/15/report-walmart-workers-cost-taxpayers-6-2-billion-in-public-assistance/), even with the pay increase to $9 an hour.
- |
  And yet, Walmart’s CEO, Doug McMillon, received $25.6 million in compensation last year (2014).
- |
  It would take more than 2.8 million hours, of earning $9 per hour, to reach the roughly $25.6 million in compensation McMillon earned in 2014, his first year on the job no less.  (There are only 8,760 hours in a calendar year and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management estimates the average number of actual work hours in a year to be 2,087).
- |
  That’s what this article is about.

- "I would like to impress upon you the importance of a college education. If you
  go to college, especially for journalism. Then earn a degree, at least a BA, in
  journalism. To which you apply for a job at the Pew Research Center where you work
  diligently and expeditiously at every position you are given until the time in which
  you qualify to even apply for the opening (there has to be an opening) position
  as Senior Writer. If and only if you land the position of Senior Writer at Pew Research
  Center will you and Mr.DeSilver NOT BE equal. Yes, that is right I said “NOT BE”.
  You see if there is an opening it is probably because Mr.DeSilver was promoted and
  now makes even more than you do. Nice try though. You see this is America, more
  specifically the United States of America, and here you work for what you want.
  \ It is not handed to on a “DeSilver platter”. \n"

  As an educated individual by chance and luck and hard work none the less, I very well understand that even as and individual that migrated to the United States with my family having only $500 and a small network we had enough human and social capital that brought about certain opportunities that many will never see. There are different levels of advantages that one has to acknowledge, particularly those that are educated and find a strong levels of importance in education as yourself. Although I grew up with little money and no documents the fact that my father had a college education, my mother with some college education, and the family network that was well established in the United States gave us much greater advantage then someone growing up in some of the most impoverished areas of the United States. These areas have poor quality of education, high crime rates, little economic or political stability etc. These areas have been describe and compared to war zones having very similar post traumatic stress effects on individuals. They have been called food deserts because for miles there may not be a grocery store near by just liquor stores and McDonalds. Furthermore, they are heavily represented by minorities particularly African Americans and Latinos. Therefore, with your education you may wonder well what is going on there. Why are the majority of people living in poverty minority, why do they have low educational attainment and the other social problems that exist as their reality…. And then you have do research with that education and look in to underlying structures that have perpetuated a state of oppression for many and why that is growing. If you truly believe we live in a meritocracy than I suggest you use your education to get real. The idea is not for all to be equal but for all to have equal opportunities so they can get out of poverty and become less dependent on the government and instead contribute to the growth of a the economy.

- "I would like to impress upon you the importance of a college education.  A college
  education allows for more opportunities and advantages in today’s work force.  If
  you are interested in producing as much income as Mr. DeSilver does than I suggest
  you go to college and earn at least a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism.  To which
  you use the degree to apply for a position at Pew Research Center (P.R.C).  At this
  point I would advise you to work diligently as well as expeditiously as any and
  all responsibilities you are given at P.R.C.  I would also advise you to apply for
  any positional openings that would assist with your advancement in the company until
  you could qualify to even apply for the opening (there has to be an opening) Senior
  Writer position. If you actually become Senior Writer at Pew Research Company, primarily
  congratulations!  Secondly you and Mr. DeSilver will now NOT be equal. That is right
  I said “NOT”. You see if there is a Senior Writer position open that means Mr. DeSilver
  was more than likely promoted and is now your boss. I am sorry to inform you but
  this is America, more specifically the United States of America. In this country
  we work for what we want it is not handed to us on a “DeSilver platter”. \n"

  Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your WorldAbout | Follow UsBy Drew DeSilver9 commentsWith more attention being paid to economic inequality in the United States, it’s also worth looking at how the nation compares globally. As it happens, the U.S. has one of the most unequal income distributions in the developed world, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — even after taxes and social-welfare policies are taken into account.Income, of course, isn’t the only way to measure economic inequality, but it is the most common, especially when making cross-national comparisons. Income inequality often is expressed in terms of the Gini index, a summary statistic that measures the dispersion of incomes on a scale of zero (everyone has exactly the same income) to 1 (one person has all the income).The OECD, a group of 34 mostly developed economies, calculates Gini coefficients for most of its member countries, both before and after taxes and transfer payments. That helps address criticism from some economists that income-based measures of inequality ignore the redistributive impact of such programs as Social Security, the earned income tax credit and unemployment insurance. (We looked at the 31 OECD countries that had both sets of Gini scores for a reasonably recent year, in most cases 2010.)Before accounting for taxes and transfers, the U.S. ranked 10th in income inequality; among the countries with more unequal income distributions were France, the U.K. and Ireland. But after taking taxes and transfers into account, the U.S. had the second-highest level of inequality, behind only Chile. (Mexico and Brazil had higher after-tax/transfer Gini scores, but no “before” scores with which to compare them; including them would push the U.S. down to fourth place.)It’s not that taxes and social-insurance policies in the U.S. have no redistributive effect. Before taxes and transfers, according to a new Congressional Budget Office report, the bottom 20% of Americans had 2.3% of all income, while the top 20% had 57.9%. After taxes and transfers, the bottom 20%’s share rose to 9.3%, while the top 20%’s share fell to 47.2%. (Thanks to The New York Times’ Economix blog for the chart below).However, the OECD data show that U.S. tax and spending policy does relatively little, compared with its peers in the developed world, to reduce inequality (a point made elsewhere using a similar dataset). Among the 31 OECD countries for which recent “before” and “after” Gini scores are available, the average differential was 0.163; for the U.S. the differential was 0.119. The country where tax and transfer policies do the most to reduce income inequality? Ireland, which ranked highest before taxes and transfers but 10th after.Topics: Income InequalityDrew DeSilver is a senior writer at Pew Research Center.Log In with FacebookSign In with GoogleAll comments must follow the Pew Research comment policy and will be moderated before posting.Stan Johnston • 4 months ago So in conclusion: too many people in America should get off welfarw, get a job, contribute to society and raise their income.Dustin Halstead • 4 months ago The study is regarding the income gap of those with jobs, not those without.

  The fact is, roughly 25% of the working class make so little, they not only qualify for Government assistance, but require it to supplement their low income (www.compareyourcountry.org/employment-outlook?cr=oecd&cr1=oecd&lg=en&page=2)
- |
  Working families were the biggest beneficiaries of federal programs aimed at the poor in all but six states.
- |
  (www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/business/economy/working-but-needing-public-assistance-anyway.html)
- |
  Walmart employees make so little, it cost taxpayers $6.2 billion in public assistance.
- |
  (www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2014/04/15/report-walmart-workers-cost-taxpayers-6-2-billion-in-public-assistance/), even with the pay increase to $9 an hour.
- |
  And yet, Walmart’s CEO, Doug McMillon, received $25.6 million in compensation last year (2014).
- |
  It would take more than 2.8 million hours, of earning $9 per hour, to reach the roughly $25.6 million in compensation McMillon earned in 2014, his first year on the job no less.  (There are only 8,760 hours in a calendar year and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management estimates the average number of actual work hours in a year to be 2,087).That’s what this article is about.Malcolm Surer • 1 year ago Dear Drew,

  I am curious to know where China and Russia stand on this chart?

  Thank you

  I would like to impress upon you the importance of a college education. If you go to college, especially for journalism. Then earn a degree, at least a BA, in journalism. To which you apply for a job at the Pew Research Center where you work diligently and expeditiously at every position you are given until the time in which you qualify to even apply for the opening (there has to be an opening) position as Senior Writer. If and only if you land the position of Senior Writer at Pew Research Center will you and Mr.DeSilver NOT BE equal. Yes, that is right I said “NOT BE”. You see if there is an opening it is probably because Mr.DeSilver was promoted and now makes even more than you do. Nice try though. You see this is America, more specifically the United States of America, and here you work for what you want.  It is not handed to on a “DeSilver platter”. Sincerely,
- |
  Elle StraussDaniela • 2 years ago Hi Elle,

  As an educated individual by chance and luck and hard work none the less, I very well understand that even as and individual that migrated to the United States with my family having only $500 and a small network we had enough human and social capital that brought about certain opportunities that many will never see. There are different levels of advantages that one has to acknowledge, particularly those that are educated and find a strong levels of importance in education as yourself. Although I grew up with little money and no documents the fact that my father had a college education, my mother with some college education, and the family network that was well established in the United States gave us much greater advantage then someone growing up in some of the most impoverished areas of the United States. These areas have poor quality of education, high crime rates, little economic or political stability etc. These areas have been describe and compared to war zones having very similar post traumatic stress effects on individuals. They have been called food deserts because for miles there may not be a grocery store near by just liquor stores and McDonalds. Furthermore, they are heavily represented by minorities particularly African Americans and Latinos. Therefore, with your education you may wonder well what is going on there. Why are the majority of people living in poverty minority, why do they have low educational attainment and the other social problems that exist as their reality…. And then you have do research with that education and look in to underlying structures that have perpetuated a state of oppression for many and why that is growing. If you truly believe we live in a meritocracy than I suggest you use your education to get real. The idea is not for all to be equal but for all to have equal opportunities so they can get out of poverty and become less dependent on the government and instead contribute to the growth of a the economy.Carly Baker • 4 months ago capitalism provides best opportunities for all people…period.  More govt control and involvement creates greater income gaps…as shown by liberals policies for decades.Shawn • 2 years ago Drew…how much do you make.  It is probably more than me.  Please send me a check so we are a little more equal.  Thank you.Elle Strauss • 2 years ago Dear Shawn,

  I would like to impress upon you the importance of a college education.  A college education allows for more opportunities and advantages in today’s work force.  If you are interested in producing as much income as Mr. DeSilver does than I suggest you go to college and earn at least a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism.  To which you use the degree to apply for a position at Pew Research Center (P.R.C).  At this point I would advise you to work diligently as well as expeditiously as any and all responsibilities you are given at P.R.C.  I would also advise you to apply for any positional openings that would assist with your advancement in the company until you could qualify to even apply for the opening (there has to be an opening) Senior Writer position. If you actually become Senior Writer at Pew Research Company, primarily congratulations!  Secondly you and Mr. DeSilver will now NOT be equal. That is right I said “NOT”. You see if there is a Senior Writer position open that means Mr. DeSilver was more than likely promoted and is now your boss. I am sorry to inform you but this is America, more specifically the United States of America. In this country we work for what we want it is not handed to us on a “DeSilver platter”. Sincerely,

  19, 2013\n\nGlobal inequality: How the U.S. compares\n\nBy Drew DeSilver9 comments\n\n\t\tWith
  more attention being paid to economic inequality in the United States, it’s also
  worth looking at how the nation compares globally. As it happens, the U.S. has one
  of the most unequal income distributions in the developed world, according to data
  from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — even after taxes
  and social-welfare policies are taken into account.\nIncome, of course, isn’t the
  only way to measure economic inequality, but it is the most common, especially when
  making cross-national comparisons. Income inequality often is expressed in terms
  of the Gini index, a summary statistic that measures the dispersion of incomes on
  a scale of zero (everyone has exactly the same income) to 1 (one person has all
  the income).\nThe OECD, a group of 34 mostly developed economies, calculates Gini
  coefficients for most of its member countries, both before and after taxes and transfer
  payments. That helps address criticism from some economists that income-based measures
  of inequality ignore the redistributive impact of such programs as Social Security,
  the earned income tax credit and unemployment insurance. (We looked at the 31 OECD
  countries that had both sets of Gini scores for a reasonably recent year, in most
  cases 2010.)\nBefore accounting for taxes and transfers, the U.S. ranked 10th in
  income inequality; among the countries with more unequal income distributions were France,
  the U.K. and Ireland. But after taking taxes and transfers into account, the U.S.
  had the second-highest level of inequality, behind only Chile. (Mexico and Brazil
  had higher after-tax/transfer Gini scores, but no “before” scores with which to
  compare them; including them would push the U.S. down to fourth place.)\nIt’s not
  that taxes and social-insurance policies in the U.S. have no redistributive effect.
  Before taxes and transfers, according to a new Congressional Budget Office report,
  the bottom 20% of Americans had 2.3% of all income, while the top 20% had 57.9%.
  After taxes and transfers, the bottom 20%’s share rose to 9.3%, while the top 20%’s
  share fell to 47.2%. (Thanks to The New York Times’ Economix blog for the chart
  below).\n\nHowever, the OECD data show that U.S. tax and spending policy does relatively
  little, compared with its peers in the developed world, to reduce inequality (a
  point made elsewhere using a similar dataset). Among the 31 OECD countries for which
  recent “before” and “after” Gini scores are available, the average differential
  was 0.163; for the U.S. the differential was 0.119. The country where tax and transfer
  policies do the most to reduce income inequality? Ireland, which ranked highest
  before taxes and transfers but 10th after.\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTopics: Income Inequality\n\t\t\n\tShare

  in conclusion: too many people in America should get off welfarw, get a job, contribute
  to society and raise their income.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDustin
  Halstead • 4 months ago \n\t\t\t\t\tThe study is regarding the income gap of those
  with jobs, not those without.\nThe fact is, roughly 25% of the working class make
  so little, they not only qualify for Government assistance, but require it to supplement
  their low income (www.compareyourcountry.org/employment-outlook?cr=oecd&cr1=oecd&lg=en&page=2)\nWorking
  families were the biggest beneficiaries of federal programs aimed at the poor in
  all but six states.\n(www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/business/economy/working-but-needing-public-assistance-anyway.html)\nWalmart
  employees make so little, it cost taxpayers $6.2 billion in public assistance.\n(www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2014/04/15/report-walmart-workers-cost-taxpayers-6-2-billion-in-public-assistance/),
  even with the pay increase to $9 an hour.\nAnd yet, Walmart’s CEO, Doug McMillon,
  received $25.6 million in compensation last year (2014).\nIt would take more than
  2.8 million hours, of earning $9 per hour, to reach the roughly $25.6 million in
  compensation McMillon earned in 2014, his first year on the job no less.  (There
  are only 8,760 hours in a calendar year and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management
  estimates the average number of actual work hours in a year to be 2,087).\nThat’s
  what this article is about.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMalcolm

  Strauss • 2 years ago \n\t\t\t\t\tDear Shawn,\nI would like to impress upon you
  the importance of a college education. If you go to college, especially for journalism.
  Then earn a degree, at least a BA, in journalism. To which you apply for a job at
  the Pew Research Center where you work diligently and expeditiously at every position
  you are given until the time in which you qualify to even apply for the opening
  (there has to be an opening) position as Senior Writer. If and only if you land
  the position of Senior Writer at Pew Research Center will you and Mr.DeSilver NOT
  BE equal. Yes, that is right I said “NOT BE”. You see if there is an opening it
  is probably because Mr.DeSilver was promoted and now makes even more than you do.
  Nice try though. You see this is America, more specifically the United States of
  America, and here you work for what you want.  It is not handed to on a “DeSilver
  platter”. \nSincerely,\nElle Strauss\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDaniela
  • 2 years ago \n\t\t\t\t\tHi Elle,\nAs an educated individual by chance and luck
  and hard work none the less, I very well understand that even as and individual
  that migrated to the United States with my family having only $500 and a small network
  we had enough human and social capital that brought about certain opportunities
  that many will never see. There are different levels of advantages that one has
  to acknowledge, particularly those that are educated and find a strong levels of
  importance in education as yourself. Although I grew up with little money and no
  documents the fact that my father had a college education, my mother with some college
  education, and the family network that was well established in the United States
  gave us much greater advantage then someone growing up in some of the most impoverished
  areas of the United States. These areas have poor quality of education, high crime
  rates, little economic or political stability etc. These areas have been describe
  and compared to war zones having very similar post traumatic stress effects on individuals.
  They have been called food deserts because for miles there may not be a grocery
  store near by just liquor stores and McDonalds. Furthermore, they are heavily represented
  by minorities particularly African Americans and Latinos. Therefore, with your education
  you may wonder well what is going on there. Why are the majority of people living
  in poverty minority, why do they have low educational attainment and the other social
  problems that exist as their reality…. And then you have do research with that education
  and look in to underlying structures that have perpetuated a state of oppression
  for many and why that is growing. If you truly believe we live in a meritocracy
  than I suggest you use your education to get real. The idea is not for all to be
  equal but for all to have equal opportunities so they can get out of poverty and
  become less dependent on the government and instead contribute to the growth of
  a the economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCarly
  Baker • 4 months ago \n\t\t\t\t\tcapitalism provides best opportunities for all
  people…period.  More govt control and involvement creates greater income gaps…as
  shown by liberals policies for decades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShawn
  • 2 years ago \n\t\t\t\t\tDrew…how much do you make.  It is probably more than me.
  \ Please send me a check so we are a little more equal.  Thank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tElle
  Strauss • 2 years ago \n\t\t\t\t\tDear Shawn,\nI would like to impress upon you
  the importance of a college education.  A college education allows for more opportunities
  and advantages in today’s work force.  If you are interested in producing as much
  income as Mr. DeSilver does than I suggest you go to college and earn at least a
  Bachelor of Arts in Journalism.  To which you use the degree to apply for a position
  at Pew Research Center (P.R.C).  At this point I would advise you to work diligently
  as well as expeditiously as any and all responsibilities you are given at P.R.C.
  \ I would also advise you to apply for any positional openings that would assist
  with your advancement in the company until you could qualify to even apply for the
  opening (there has to be an opening) Senior Writer position. If you actually become
  Senior Writer at Pew Research Company, primarily congratulations!  Secondly you
  and Mr. DeSilver will now NOT be equal. That is right I said “NOT”. You see if there
  is a Senior Writer position open that means Mr. DeSilver was more than likely promoted
  and is now your boss. I am sorry to inform you but this is America, more specifically
  the United States of America. In this country we work for what we want it is not
  handed to us on a “DeSilver platter”. \nSincerely,\nElle Strauss\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

  commentsWith more attention being paid to economic inequality in the United States,
  it’s also worth looking at how the nation compares globally. As it happens, the
  U.S. has one of the most unequal income distributions in the developed world, according
  to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — even after
  taxes and social-welfare policies are taken into account.Income, of course, isn’t
  the only way to measure economic inequality, but it is the most common, especially
  when making cross-national comparisons. Income inequality often is expressed in
  terms of the Gini index, a summary statistic that measures the dispersion of incomes
  on a scale of zero (everyone has exactly the same income) to 1 (one person has all
  the income).The OECD, a group of 34 mostly developed economies, calculates Gini
  coefficients for most of its member countries, both before and after taxes and transfer
  payments. That helps address criticism from some economists that income-based measures
  of inequality ignore the redistributive impact of such programs as Social Security,
  the earned income tax credit and unemployment insurance. (We looked at the 31 OECD
  countries that had both sets of Gini scores for a reasonably recent year, in most
  cases 2010.)Before accounting for taxes and transfers, the U.S. ranked 10th in income
  inequality; among the countries with more unequal income distributions were France,
  the U.K. and Ireland. But after taking taxes and transfers into account, the U.S.
  had the second-highest level of inequality, behind only Chile. (Mexico and Brazil
  had higher after-tax/transfer Gini scores, but no “before” scores with which to
  compare them; including them would push the U.S. down to fourth place.)It’s not
  that taxes and social-insurance policies in the U.S. have no redistributive effect.
  Before taxes and transfers, according to a new Congressional Budget Office report,
  the bottom 20% of Americans had 2.3% of all income, while the top 20% had 57.9%.
  After taxes and transfers, the bottom 20%’s share rose to 9.3%, while the top 20%’s
  share fell to 47.2%. (Thanks to The New York Times’ Economix blog for the chart
  below).However, the OECD data show that U.S. tax and spending policy does relatively
  little, compared with its peers in the developed world, to reduce inequality (a
  point made elsewhere using a similar dataset). Among the 31 OECD countries for which
  recent “before” and “after” Gini scores are available, the average differential
  was 0.163; for the U.S. the differential was 0.119. The country where tax and transfer
  policies do the most to reduce income inequality? Ireland, which ranked highest
  before taxes and transfers but 10th after.Topics: Income InequalityDrew DeSilver

  should get off welfarw, get a job, contribute to society and raise their income.Dustin
  Halstead • 4 months ago The study is regarding the income gap of those with jobs,
  not those without.\nThe fact is, roughly 25% of the working class make so little,
  they not only qualify for Government assistance, but require it to supplement their
  low income (www.compareyourcountry.org/employment-outlook?cr=oecd&cr1=oecd&lg=en&page=2)\nWorking
  families were the biggest beneficiaries of federal programs aimed at the poor in
  all but six states.\n(www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/business/economy/working-but-needing-public-assistance-anyway.html)\nWalmart
  employees make so little, it cost taxpayers $6.2 billion in public assistance.\n(www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2014/04/15/report-walmart-workers-cost-taxpayers-6-2-billion-in-public-assistance/),
  even with the pay increase to $9 an hour.\nAnd yet, Walmart’s CEO, Doug McMillon,
  received $25.6 million in compensation last year (2014).\nIt would take more than
  2.8 million hours, of earning $9 per hour, to reach the roughly $25.6 million in
  compensation McMillon earned in 2014, his first year on the job no less.  (There
  are only 8,760 hours in a calendar year and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management
  estimates the average number of actual work hours in a year to be 2,087).That’s
  what this article is about.Malcolm Surer • 1 year ago Dear Drew,\nI am curious to
  know where China and Russia stand on this chart?\nThank you\nMalcolmJessica Ely

  would like to impress upon you the importance of a college education. If you go
  to college, especially for journalism. Then earn a degree, at least a BA, in journalism.
  To which you apply for a job at the Pew Research Center where you work diligently
  and expeditiously at every position you are given until the time in which you qualify
  to even apply for the opening (there has to be an opening) position as Senior Writer.
  If and only if you land the position of Senior Writer at Pew Research Center will
  you and Mr.DeSilver NOT BE equal. Yes, that is right I said “NOT BE”. You see if
  there is an opening it is probably because Mr.DeSilver was promoted and now makes
  even more than you do. Nice try though. You see this is America, more specifically
  the United States of America, and here you work for what you want.  It is not handed
  to on a “DeSilver platter”. Sincerely,\nElle StraussDaniela • 2 years ago Hi Elle,\nAs
  an educated individual by chance and luck and hard work none the less, I very well
  understand that even as and individual that migrated to the United States with my
  family having only $500 and a small network we had enough human and social capital
  that brought about certain opportunities that many will never see. There are different
  levels of advantages that one has to acknowledge, particularly those that are educated
  and find a strong levels of importance in education as yourself. Although I grew
  up with little money and no documents the fact that my father had a college education,
  my mother with some college education, and the family network that was well established
  in the United States gave us much greater advantage then someone growing up in some
  of the most impoverished areas of the United States. These areas have poor quality
  of education, high crime rates, little economic or political stability etc. These
  areas have been describe and compared to war zones having very similar post traumatic
  stress effects on individuals. They have been called food deserts because for miles
  there may not be a grocery store near by just liquor stores and McDonalds. Furthermore,
  they are heavily represented by minorities particularly African Americans and Latinos.
  Therefore, with your education you may wonder well what is going on there. Why are
  the majority of people living in poverty minority, why do they have low educational
  attainment and the other social problems that exist as their reality…. And then
  you have do research with that education and look in to underlying structures that
  have perpetuated a state of oppression for many and why that is growing. If you
  truly believe we live in a meritocracy than I suggest you use your education to
  get real. The idea is not for all to be equal but for all to have equal opportunities
  so they can get out of poverty and become less dependent on the government and instead
  contribute to the growth of a the economy.Carly Baker • 4 months ago capitalism
  provides best opportunities for all people…period.  More govt control and involvement
  creates greater income gaps…as shown by liberals policies for decades.Shawn • 2
  years ago Drew…how much do you make.  It is probably more than me.  Please send
  me a check so we are a little more equal.  Thank you.Elle Strauss • 2 years ago
  Dear Shawn,\nI would like to impress upon you the importance of a college education.
  \ A college education allows for more opportunities and advantages in today’s work
  force.  If you are interested in producing as much income as Mr. DeSilver does than
  I suggest you go to college and earn at least a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism.
  \ To which you use the degree to apply for a position at Pew Research Center (P.R.C).
  \ At this point I would advise you to work diligently as well as expeditiously as
  any and all responsibilities you are given at P.R.C.  I would also advise you to
  apply for any positional openings that would assist with your advancement in the
  company until you could qualify to even apply for the opening (there has to be an
  opening) Senior Writer position. If you actually become Senior Writer at Pew Research
  Company, primarily congratulations!  Secondly you and Mr. DeSilver will now NOT
  be equal. That is right I said “NOT”. You see if there is a Senior Writer position
  open that means Mr. DeSilver was more than likely promoted and is now your boss.
  I am sorry to inform you but this is America, more specifically the United States
  of America. In this country we work for what we want it is not handed to us on a
  “DeSilver platter”. Sincerely,\nElle StraussReal-time analysis and news about data
