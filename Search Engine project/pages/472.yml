                  The Environmental Protection Agency broke the law in a social media campaign intended to generate public support for a controversial rule to protect small streams and wetlands from development and pollution, congressional auditors said Monday.

                  The EPA's campaign violated restrictions against lobbying and propaganda by federal agencies, the Government Accountability Office said in a 26-page report. The agency blitzed social media in a campaign that urged the public to submit comments on the draft water rule. The effort reached at least 1.8 million people.

                  Republican Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma said the GAO finding confirms what he has long suspected: "that EPA will go to extreme lengths and even violate the law to promote its activist environmental agenda."

                  The Obama administration says the water rule will safeguard drinking water for 117 million Americans, but Republicans and a handful of Democrats from rural states say they fear a steady uptick in federal regulation of every stream and ditch.   Inhofe and other lawmakers have vowed to block the rule as an example of overreach by the Obama administration.

                  Federal courts have already put the regulations on hold as they consider a number of lawsuits challenging the water regulations. The rules clarify which smaller waterways fall under federal protection after two Supreme Court rulings left the reach of the Clean Water Act uncertain. Those decisions in 2001 and 2006 left 60 percent of the nation's streams and millions of acres of wetlands without clear federal protection, according to the EPA, causing confusion for landowners and government officials.

                  The EPA said in a statement that it disagrees with the GAO's assessment, but will fulfill whatever reporting requirements are necessary.

                  "We maintain that using social media to educate the public about our work is an integral part of our mission," the agency's statement said. "We use social media tools just like all organizations to stay connected and inform people across the country about our activities."

                  On the water rule, the agency said its social media activity simply directed users to a general webpage about the Clean Water Rule and provided an Internet link to education and outreach materials, emails and presentations. Users also were told the deadline for submitting public comments and how to do so, said spokeswoman Liz Purchia.

                  "At no point did EPA encourage the public to contact Congress or any state legislature," she said.   In its report, the GAO said EPA used a social media platform called "Thunderclap" that posts messages on social media accounts of supporters. The EPA's Thunderclap campaign was entitled, "I Choose Clean Water" and was attributed to the agency.   
- "                \n"

                  The site touted the benefits of clean water and said the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have "proposed to strengthen protection for the clean water that is vital to all Americans."   The EPA actively promoted the Thunderclap campaign on its Twitter and Facebook accounts and in blog posts by EPA officials. Thunderclap estimates the EPA's message reached about 1.8 million people, the report said.

                  The GAO also faulted the EPA for a separate campaign that provided Internet hyperlinks to websites run by environmental advocacy groups. In one of the posts, an EPA official says he supports the rule because he is a surfer and a beer drinker and doesn't "want to get sick from pollution."   
- "                \n"

- |2
                  The phrase "sick from pollution" includes a hyperlink to the Surfrider Foundation, a California-based advocacy group that supports the EPA rule. Similarly, a blog post by an EPA official linked to the Natural Resources Defense Council, a leading environmental group that also supports the rule.

                  The hyperlinks violated a law banning federal agencies from "grassroots lobbying," the GAO said.

  in Washington. President Barack Obama is poised to nominate McCarthy as head of

- "\t                        (AP)The Environmental Protection Agency broke the law
  in a social media campaign intended to generate public support for a controversial
  rule to protect small streams and wetlands from development and pollution, congressional
  auditors said Monday. The EPA's campaign violated restrictions against lobbying
  and propaganda by federal agencies, the Government Accountability Office said in
  a 26-page report. The agency blitzed social media in a campaign that urged the public
  to submit comments on the draft water rule. The effort reached at least 1.8 million
  people.Republican Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma said the GAO finding confirms what
  he has long suspected: \"that EPA will go to extreme lengths and even violate the
  law to promote its activist environmental agenda.\"   The Obama administration says
  the water rule will safeguard drinking water for 117 million Americans, but Republicans
  and a handful of Democrats from rural states say they fear a steady uptick in federal
  regulation of every stream and ditch.   Inhofe and other lawmakers have vowed to
  block the rule as an example of overreach by the Obama administration.   Federal
  courts have already put the regulations on hold as they consider a number of lawsuits
  challenging the water regulations. The rules clarify which smaller waterways fall
  under federal protection after two Supreme Court rulings left the reach of the Clean
  Water Act uncertain. Those decisions in 2001 and 2006 left 60 percent of the nation's
  streams and millions of acres of wetlands without clear federal protection, according
  to the EPA, causing confusion for landowners and government officials.   More than
  half the states have filed legal challenges.   The EPA said in a statement that
  it disagrees with the GAO's assessment, but will fulfill whatever reporting requirements
  are necessary.   \"We maintain that using social media to educate the public about
  our work is an integral part of our mission,\" the agency's statement said. \"We
  use social media tools just like all organizations to stay connected and inform
  people across the country about our activities.\" On the water rule, the agency
  said its social media activity simply directed users to a general webpage about
  the Clean Water Rule and provided an Internet link to education and outreach materials,
  emails and presentations. Users also were told the deadline for submitting public
  comments and how to do so, said spokeswoman Liz Purchia.   \"At no point did EPA
  encourage the public to contact Congress or any state legislature,\" she said. 
   In its report, the GAO said EPA used a social media platform called \"Thunderclap\"
  that posts messages on social media accounts of supporters. The EPA's Thunderclap
  campaign was entitled, \"I Choose Clean Water\" and was attributed to the agency. 
   The site touted the benefits of clean water and said the EPA and U.S. Army Corps
  of Engineers have \"proposed to strengthen protection for the clean water that is
  vital to all Americans.\"   The EPA actively promoted the Thunderclap campaign on
  its Twitter and Facebook accounts and in blog posts by EPA officials. Thunderclap
  estimates the EPA's message reached about 1.8 million people, the report said. 
   The GAO called the effort an example of \"covert propaganda.\" The GAO also faulted
  the EPA for a separate campaign that provided Internet hyperlinks to websites run
  by environmental advocacy groups. In one of the posts, an EPA official says he supports
  the rule because he is a surfer and a beer drinker and doesn't \"want to get sick
  from pollution.\"   The phrase \"sick from pollution\" includes a hyperlink to the
  Surfrider Foundation, a California-based advocacy group that supports the EPA rule.
  Similarly, a blog post by an EPA official linked to the Natural Resources Defense
  Council, a leading environmental group that also supports the rule.   The hyperlinks
  violated a law banning federal agencies from \"grassroots lobbying,\" the GAO said.AdvertisementAdvertisement©2015

  \   \n        \n        \n        \n            \n                The Environmental
  Protection Agency broke the law in a social media campaign intended to generate
  public support for a controversial rule to protect small streams and wetlands from
  development and pollution, congressional auditors said Monday. \n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                The EPA's campaign violated
  restrictions against lobbying and propaganda by federal agencies, the Government
  Accountability Office said in a 26-page report. The agency blitzed social media
  in a campaign that urged the public to submit comments on the draft water rule.
  The effort reached at least 1.8 million people.\n                \n                \r\n\n
  \           \n                Republican Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma said the
  GAO finding confirms what he has long suspected: \"that EPA will go to extreme lengths
  and even violate the law to promote its activist environmental agenda.\"   \n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                The Obama administration says
  the water rule will safeguard drinking water for 117 million Americans, but Republicans
  and a handful of Democrats from rural states say they fear a steady uptick in federal
  regulation of every stream and ditch.   Inhofe and other lawmakers have vowed to
  block the rule as an example of overreach by the Obama administration.   \n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                Federal courts have already
  put the regulations on hold as they consider a number of lawsuits challenging the
  water regulations. The rules clarify which smaller waterways fall under federal
  protection after two Supreme Court rulings left the reach of the Clean Water Act
  uncertain. Those decisions in 2001 and 2006 left 60 percent of the nation's streams
  and millions of acres of wetlands without clear federal protection, according to
  the EPA, causing confusion for landowners and government officials.   \n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                More than half the states have
  filed legal challenges.   \n                \n                \r\n\n            \n
  \               The EPA said in a statement that it disagrees with the GAO's assessment,
  but will fulfill whatever reporting requirements are necessary.   \n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                \"We maintain that using social
  media to educate the public about our work is an integral part of our mission,\"
  the agency's statement said. \"We use social media tools just like all organizations
  to stay connected and inform people across the country about our activities.\" \n
  \               \n                \r\n\n            \n                On the water
  rule, the agency said its social media activity simply directed users to a general
  webpage about the Clean Water Rule and provided an Internet link to education and
  outreach materials, emails and presentations. Users also were told the deadline
  for submitting public comments and how to do so, said spokeswoman Liz Purchia. 
   \n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                \"At no
  point did EPA encourage the public to contact Congress or any state legislature,\"
  she said.   In its report, the GAO said EPA used a social media platform called
  \"Thunderclap\" that posts messages on social media accounts of supporters. The
  EPA's Thunderclap campaign was entitled, \"I Choose Clean Water\" and was attributed
  to the agency.   \n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                The
  site touted the benefits of clean water and said the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of
  Engineers have \"proposed to strengthen protection for the clean water that is vital
  to all Americans.\"   The EPA actively promoted the Thunderclap campaign on its
  Twitter and Facebook accounts and in blog posts by EPA officials. Thunderclap estimates
  the EPA's message reached about 1.8 million people, the report said.   \n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                The GAO called the effort an
  example of \"covert propaganda.\" \n                \n                \r\n\n            \n
  \               The GAO also faulted the EPA for a separate campaign that provided
  Internet hyperlinks to websites run by environmental advocacy groups. In one of
  the posts, an EPA official says he supports the rule because he is a surfer and
  a beer drinker and doesn't \"want to get sick from pollution.\"   \n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                The phrase \"sick from pollution\"
  includes a hyperlink to the Surfrider Foundation, a California-based advocacy group
  that supports the EPA rule. Similarly, a blog post by an EPA official linked to
  the Natural Resources Defense Council, a leading environmental group that also supports
  the rule.   \n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                The
  hyperlinks violated a law banning federal agencies from \"grassroots lobbying,\"
  the GAO said.\n                \n                \r\n\n            \n\n            \n

  from rural states say they fear a steady uptick in federal regulation of every stream
  and ditch.   Inhofe and other lawmakers have vowed to block the rule as an example
  of overreach by the Obama administration.   Federal courts have already put the
  regulations on hold as they consider a number of lawsuits challenging the water
  regulations. The rules clarify which smaller waterways fall under federal protection
  after two Supreme Court rulings left the reach of the Clean Water Act uncertain.
  Those decisions in 2001 and 2006 left 60 percent of the nation's streams and millions
  of acres of wetlands without clear federal protection, according to the EPA, causing
  confusion for landowners and government officials.   More than half the states have
  filed legal challenges.   The EPA said in a statement that it disagrees with the
  GAO's assessment, but will fulfill whatever reporting requirements are necessary. 
   \"We maintain that using social media to educate the public about our work is an
  integral part of our mission,\" the agency's statement said. \"We use social media
  tools just like all organizations to stay connected and inform people across the
  country about our activities.\" On the water rule, the agency said its social media
  activity simply directed users to a general webpage about the Clean Water Rule and
  provided an Internet link to education and outreach materials, emails and presentations.
  Users also were told the deadline for submitting public comments and how to do so,
  said spokeswoman Liz Purchia.   \"At no point did EPA encourage the public to contact
  Congress or any state legislature,\" she said.   In its report, the GAO said EPA
  used a social media platform called \"Thunderclap\" that posts messages on social
  media accounts of supporters. The EPA's Thunderclap campaign was entitled, \"I Choose
  Clean Water\" and was attributed to the agency.   The site touted the benefits of
  clean water and said the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have \"proposed to
  strengthen protection for the clean water that is vital to all Americans.\"   The
  EPA actively promoted the Thunderclap campaign on its Twitter and Facebook accounts
  and in blog posts by EPA officials. Thunderclap estimates the EPA's message reached
  about 1.8 million people, the report said.   The GAO called the effort an example
  of \"covert propaganda.\" The GAO also faulted the EPA for a separate campaign that
  provided Internet hyperlinks to websites run by environmental advocacy groups. In
  one of the posts, an EPA official says he supports the rule because he is a surfer
  and a beer drinker and doesn't \"want to get sick from pollution.\"   The phrase
  \"sick from pollution\" includes a hyperlink to the Surfrider Foundation, a California-based
  advocacy group that supports the EPA rule. Similarly, a blog post by an EPA official
  linked to the Natural Resources Defense Council, a leading environmental group that
  also supports the rule.   The hyperlinks violated a law banning federal agencies
  from \"grassroots lobbying,\" the GAO said.AdvertisementAdvertisement©2015 FOX News
