  Claire Voisin goes to the board, eraser in one hand, chalk in the other, and draws
  geometrical figures side by side with complicated calculations. Voisin, a senior
  researcher at the Institut de mathématiques de Jussieu1 in Paris is a specialist
  in algebraic geometry. More specifically, she works on the study of the \x93topology
  of complex algebraic varieties.\x94 To introduce her field, she sketches a sphere
  that she cuts up in three-dimensional triangles with curved edges, as if they had
  been shaped by the rounded surface. The result is that you can cover a sphere with
  triangles, which are themselves the \x93faces\x94 of a pyramid, for example. \x93Topologically
  speaking,\x94 Voisin explains, \x93a sphere and the surface of a pyramid are therefore
  identical\x96though saying something like that is an absurdity from the point of
  view of algebraic geometry,\x94 she immediately points out. According to her, \x93this
  is also possible with an inner tube that has one or more holes.\x94 If \x93triangulated,\x94
  the result is a skeleton made up of triangles stuck together along their sides.
  A metric induced by the ambient space then gives rise to a complex structure, hence
  to a Riemann surface, which turns out to be a purely algebraic object, a projective
  curve. And in higher dimensions, the problem becomes even more complex. To get from
  one figure to the other therefore involves a mathematical trick, the precise details
  of which are very difficult to grasp for a non-specialist, involving such words
  as homeomorphism, simplex, Riemann surface, transcendental functions, etc. But the
  general idea is clear: moving between the \x93topological,\x94 the \x93algebraic,\x94
  and \x93complex geometry,\x94 the result is a\x94multiplicity of perspectives of
  one and the same object\x94 using different mathematical approaches. \x93What's
  exciting about my work is this constant moving back and forth several geometries
  and several types of tools to prove results in one field or another,\x94 Voisin
  continues. She resembles the typical mathematician as we often imagine them, with
  a particular ability for abstract thinking. In fact, though mathematics came easy
  to Voisin both at school where she was already boning up on final year courses,
  then at the École normale supérieure and while doing her PhD, she knows that for
  all intents and purposes, she speaks a language that is foreign to most ordinary
  people. It's not easy to follow what she says. That's true even for the students
  studying for their Masters in mathematics, to whom she teaches a few courses a year,
  attempting to \x93explain these superb ideas.\x94 Yet they often drop out, discouraged
  by the complexity of the field. \x93It's very frustrating not to be able to get
  across all the things that mean so much to me in my work and research,\x94 says
  Voisin regretfully. She remembers the six months during which she was an assistant
  professor, before she got a CNRS position, as being \x93hellish.\x94 \x93Joining
  CNRS saved my life!\x94 she jokes. Becoming a full time researcher at the age of
  24, she could at last devote herself entirely to algebraic geometry, the study of
  the properties of sets defined by algebraic equation systems, which is at the heart
  of the most abstract mathematics. \x93There is creative drive in mathematics, it's
  all about movement trying to express itself,\x94 Voisin confides. Nothing to do
  with the \x93boring, dead, and dry\x94 mathematics taught in secondary school, where
  the courses go through an endless series of \x93definitions, properties, and theorems\x94
  using a method that is \x93always under control, as if on tracks,\x94 and which
  is applied to \x93simple exercises in logic.\x94 After her doctoral thesis, she
  became fascinated by a tool that is well known to topology specialists, Hodge theory,
  which can also be used to tackle complex algebraic geometry. Published in 2003,
  her book on the subject has rapidly become a reference. She won a number of prizes
  and awards, such as the CNRS bronze (1988) and silver (2006) medals, and the Clay
  Research Award (2008) from the Clay Mathematics Institute,2 for her work on Kodaira's
  conjecture, another problem in complex algebraic geometry. As an editor of several
  mathematical journals, she always keeps an eye on the development of her discipline.
  In her private life, she is also a mother of five, and her eldest daughter started
  studying mathematics. \x93But her field is far removed from mine and that of my
  husband\x96also a mathematician\x96so as to avoid any family 'pressure,'\x94 she
  explains. \x93In any case,\x94 she adds, \x93we never talk maths at home!\x94 \r\n"

  algebraic geometry speak \x93volumes,\x94 Claire Voisin has become a reference for
  specialists of the Hodge theory. But it is her work on Kodaira's conjecture that
  won her the Clay Research award in 2008.\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n          © C. Lebedinsky/CNRS
  PhotothèqueVery quickly, words no longer suffice. Claire Voisin goes to the board,
  eraser in one hand, chalk in the other, and draws geometrical figures side by side
  with complicated calculations. Voisin, a senior researcher at the Institut de mathématiques
  de Jussieu1 in Paris is a specialist in algebraic geometry. More specifically, she
  works on the study of the \x93topology of complex algebraic varieties.\x94 To introduce
  her field, she sketches a sphere that she cuts up in three-dimensional triangles
  with curved edges, as if they had been shaped by the rounded surface. The result
  is that you can cover a sphere with triangles, which are themselves the \x93faces\x94
  of a pyramid, for example. \x93Topologically speaking,\x94 Voisin explains, \x93a
  sphere and the surface of a pyramid are therefore identical\x96though saying something
  like that is an absurdity from the point of view of algebraic geometry,\x94 she
  immediately points out. According to her, \x93this is also possible with an inner
  tube that has one or more holes.\x94 If \x93triangulated,\x94 the result is a skeleton
  made up of triangles stuck together along their sides. A metric induced by the ambient
  space then gives rise to a complex structure, hence to a Riemann surface, which
  turns out to be a purely algebraic object, a projective curve. And in higher dimensions,
  the problem becomes even more complex. To get from one figure to the other therefore
  involves a mathematical trick, the precise details of which are very difficult to
  grasp for a non-specialist, involving such words as homeomorphism, simplex, Riemann
  surface, transcendental functions, etc. But the general idea is clear: moving between
  the \x93topological,\x94 the \x93algebraic,\x94 and \x93complex geometry,\x94 the
  result is a\x94multiplicity of perspectives of one and the same object\x94 using
  different mathematical approaches. \x93What's exciting about my work is this constant
  moving back and forth several geometries and several types of tools to prove results
  in one field or another,\x94 Voisin continues. She resembles the typical mathematician
  as we often imagine them, with a particular ability for abstract thinking. In fact,
  though mathematics came easy to Voisin both at school where she was already boning
  up on final year courses, then at the École normale supérieure and while doing her
  PhD, she knows that for all intents and purposes, she speaks a language that is
  foreign to most ordinary people. It's not easy to follow what she says. That's true
  even for the students studying for their Masters in mathematics, to whom she teaches
  a few courses a year, attempting to \x93explain these superb ideas.\x94 Yet they
  often drop out, discouraged by the complexity of the field. \x93It's very frustrating
  not to be able to get across all the things that mean so much to me in my work and
  research,\x94 says Voisin regretfully. She remembers the six months during which
  she was an assistant professor, before she got a CNRS position, as being \x93hellish.\x94
  \x93Joining CNRS saved my life!\x94 she jokes. Becoming a full time researcher at
  the age of 24, she could at last devote herself entirely to algebraic geometry,
  the study of the properties of sets defined by algebraic equation systems, which
  is at the heart of the most abstract mathematics. \x93There is creative drive in
  mathematics, it's all about movement trying to express itself,\x94 Voisin confides.
  Nothing to do with the \x93boring, dead, and dry\x94 mathematics taught in secondary
  school, where the courses go through an endless series of \x93definitions, properties,
  and theorems\x94 using a method that is \x93always under control, as if on tracks,\x94
  and which is applied to \x93simple exercises in logic.\x94 After her doctoral thesis,
  she became fascinated by a tool that is well known to topology specialists, Hodge
  theory, which can also be used to tackle complex algebraic geometry. Published in
  2003, her book on the subject has rapidly become a reference. She won a number of
  prizes and awards, such as the CNRS bronze (1988) and silver (2006) medals, and
  the Clay Research Award (2008) from the Clay Mathematics Institute,2 for her work
  on Kodaira's conjecture, another problem in complex algebraic geometry. As an editor
  of several mathematical journals, she always keeps an eye on the development of
  her discipline. In her private life, she is also a mother of five, and her eldest
  daughter started studying mathematics. \x93But her field is far removed from mine
  and that of my husband\x96also a mathematician\x96so as to avoid any family 'pressure,'\x94
  she explains. \x93In any case,\x94 she adds, \x93we never talk maths at home!\x94
