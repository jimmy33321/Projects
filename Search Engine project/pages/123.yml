  The Center for Theoretical Neuroscience was established at

  Columbia University in New York City in 2004.
- |
  We are excited to bring our varied
- |
  theoretical approaches together (please click on the "people" link to
- |
  learn more about the work we each do). We interact closely
- |
  with the
- |
  many experimental
- |
  neuroscientists here at Columbia and elsewhere in New York City
- |
  and also with other theoretical
- |
  biologists here and with long-term visitors to our center.
- |
  We believe we have one of the most exciting and interactive
- |
  environments anywhere for bringing theoretical approaches to
- "Neuroscience. \n"

- |
  In Fall of 2016 we, along with a large group of experimental neuroscientists, will be moving to a new neuroscience building on Columbia's new Manhattanville campus, the Jerome L. Greene Science Center, as part of the  Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute.

  We are currently accepting applications for post-doc positions.
