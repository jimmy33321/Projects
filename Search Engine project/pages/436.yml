                  The FBI played a central role in making a botched “payment” meant to help secure Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl’s release last year, according to the office of a House Republican now seeking answers on why the bureau was involved at all in the apparent rescue attempt.

- |2
                  Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif. -- who has long questioned whether a ransom of some kind was offered for Bergdahl’s release -- claimed in a recent letter to the Justice Department inspector general that he has learned “non-DoD organizations, led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), undertook the recovery mission.”
- "                \n"
- "                \r\n"
- |2+

- "            \n"
- |2
                  As part of this effort, Hunter told DOJ IG Michael Horowitz, the FBI even went to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and “awaited Bergdahl’s arrival following some form of discussion about facilitating a payment.”
- "                \n"
- "                \r\n"
- |2+

- "            \n"
- |2
                  Bergdahl didn’t show – and ultimately was not released until May when he was traded for five Taliban leaders. Hunter’s chief of staff, Joe Kasper, told FoxNews.com the unsuccessful FBI border visit came after this operation paid an Afghan intermediary, who then ran off with the money.
- "                \n"
- "                \r\n"
- |2+

- "            \n"
- |2
                  “The FBI was leading the op,” Kasper said. 
- "                \n"
- "                \r\n"
- |2+

- "            \n"
- |2
                  Hunter now wants the DOJ IG to look into the alleged payment, including the amount and whether it was made in violation of the law. 
- "                \n"
- "                \r\n"
- |2+

- "            \n"
- |2
                  A representative with the FBI did not comment on Hunter’s claims when asked by FoxNews.com. 
- "                \n"
- "                \r\n"
- |2+

- "            \n"
- |2
                  Hunter previously has said such a botched payment was made and initially pointed the finger at Joint Special Operations Command, but has not discussed the extent of the FBI’s alleged role until now. Hunter’s claims were first reported in The Daily Beast. 
- "                \n"
- "                \r\n"
- |2+

- "            \n"

                  The letter to Horowitz comes after the House Armed Services Committee released a detailed report saying the Defense Department inspector general could not confirm that any payment was made in an effort to recover Bergdahl, whose desertion case was referred Monday to a general court-martial. All the DOD IG could confirm was that “small payments were made to individuals in return for information” on Bergdahl’s captors, whereabouts and condition. The Pentagon last year also denied that a ransom was paid.
- "                \n"
- "                \r\n"
- |2+

- "            \n"
- |2
                  But Hunter’s letter shifts the focus to the DOJ and FBI.
- "                \n"
- "                \r\n"
- |2+

- "            \n"
- |2
                  It asks the Justice Department inspector general to look at whether a payment was made from within that department, if one was not made by the DOD.
- "                \n"
- "                \r\n"
- |2+

- "            \n"
- |2
                  Hunter, in the letter, called for a “thorough and substantive review” of the FBI’s alleged involvement. He also questioned what authority the FBI had to pursue Bergdahl’s release since he was a uniformed service member and not a civilian.
- "                \n"
- "                \r\n"
- |2+

- "            \n"
- |2
                  “We’re going to try to get to the bottom of it,” Kasper said Monday.
- "                \n"
- "                \r\n"
- |2+

- "            \n"
- |2
                  He said a chief concern is that the FBI is not necessarily equipped to recover Americans held captive in hostile areas.
- "                \n"
- "                \r\n"
- |2+

- "            \n"
- |2
                  “They don’t have the assets. They don’t have the resources,” he said.
- "                \n"
- "                \r\n"
- |2+

- "            \n"
- |2
                  The U.S. government as a matter of policy does not pay ransom for terror hostages, and Kasper acknowledged the administration will never confirm a “ransom” was paid in this case. But he suggested the government could have offered a payment of some kind – without calling it a ransom.

- "\t\t\t\tThe FBI played a central role in making a botched “payment” meant to help
  secure Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl’s release last year, according to the office of a
  House Republican now seeking answers on why the bureau was involved at all in the
  apparent rescue attempt.  Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif. -- who has long questioned
  whether a ransom of some kind was offered for Bergdahl’s release -- claimed in a
  recent letter to the Justice Department inspector general that he has learned “non-DoD
  organizations, led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), undertook the recovery
  mission.”As part of this effort, Hunter told DOJ IG Michael Horowitz, the FBI even
  went to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and “awaited Bergdahl’s arrival following
  some form of discussion about facilitating a payment.”Bergdahl didn’t show – and
  ultimately was not released until May when he was traded for five Taliban leaders.
  Hunter’s chief of staff, Joe Kasper, told FoxNews.com the unsuccessful FBI border
  visit came after this operation paid an Afghan intermediary, who then ran off with
  the money.“The FBI was leading the op,” Kasper said. Hunter now wants the DOJ IG
  to look into the alleged payment, including the amount and whether it was made in
  violation of the law. A representative with the FBI did not comment on Hunter’s
  claims when asked by FoxNews.com. Hunter previously has said such a botched payment
  was made and initially pointed the finger at Joint Special Operations Command, but
  has not discussed the extent of the FBI’s alleged role until now. Hunter’s claims
  were first reported in The Daily Beast. The letter to Horowitz comes after the House
  Armed Services Committee released a detailed report saying the Defense Department
  inspector general could not confirm that any payment was made in an effort to recover
  Bergdahl, whose desertion case was referred Monday to a general court-martial. All
  the DOD IG could confirm was that “small payments were made to individuals in return
  for information” on Bergdahl’s captors, whereabouts and condition. The Pentagon
  last year also denied that a ransom was paid.But Hunter’s letter shifts the focus
  to the DOJ and FBI.It asks the Justice Department inspector general to look at whether
  a payment was made from within that department, if one was not made by the DOD.Hunter,
  in the letter, called for a “thorough and substantive review” of the FBI’s alleged
  involvement. He also questioned what authority the FBI had to pursue Bergdahl’s
  release since he was a uniformed service member and not a civilian.“We’re going
  to try to get to the bottom of it,” Kasper said Monday.He said a chief concern is
  that the FBI is not necessarily equipped to recover Americans held captive in hostile
  areas.“They don’t have the assets. They don’t have the resources,” he said.The U.S.
  government as a matter of policy does not pay ransom for terror hostages, and Kasper
  acknowledged the administration will never confirm a “ransom” was paid in this case.
  But he suggested the government could have offered a payment of some kind – without
  calling it a ransom. AdvertisementAdvertisement©2015 FOX News Network, LLC. All

  \       \n        \n            \n                The FBI played a central role
  in making a botched “payment” meant to help secure Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl’s release
  last year, according to the office of a House Republican now seeking answers on
  why the bureau was involved at all in the apparent rescue attempt.  \n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif.
  -- who has long questioned whether a ransom of some kind was offered for Bergdahl’s
  release -- claimed in a recent letter to the Justice Department inspector general
  that he has learned “non-DoD organizations, led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
  (FBI), undertook the recovery mission.”\n                \n                \r\n\n
  \           \n                As part of this effort, Hunter told DOJ IG Michael
  Horowitz, the FBI even went to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and “awaited Bergdahl’s
  arrival following some form of discussion about facilitating a payment.”\n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                Bergdahl didn’t show – and ultimately
  was not released until May when he was traded for five Taliban leaders. Hunter’s
  chief of staff, Joe Kasper, told FoxNews.com the unsuccessful FBI border visit came
  after this operation paid an Afghan intermediary, who then ran off with the money.\n
  \               \n                \r\n\n            \n                “The FBI was
  leading the op,” Kasper said. \n                \n                \r\n\n            \n
  \               Hunter now wants the DOJ IG to look into the alleged payment, including
  the amount and whether it was made in violation of the law. \n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                A representative with the FBI
  did not comment on Hunter’s claims when asked by FoxNews.com. \n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                Hunter previously has said such
  a botched payment was made and initially pointed the finger at Joint Special Operations
  Command, but has not discussed the extent of the FBI’s alleged role until now. Hunter’s
  claims were first reported in The Daily Beast. \n                \n                \r\n\n
  \           \n                The letter to Horowitz comes after the House Armed
  Services Committee released a detailed report saying the Defense Department inspector
  general could not confirm that any payment was made in an effort to recover Bergdahl,
  whose desertion case was referred Monday to a general court-martial. All the DOD
  IG could confirm was that “small payments were made to individuals in return for
  information” on Bergdahl’s captors, whereabouts and condition. The Pentagon last
  year also denied that a ransom was paid.\n                \n                \r\n\n
  \           \n                But Hunter’s letter shifts the focus to the DOJ and
  FBI.\n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                It asks
  the Justice Department inspector general to look at whether a payment was made from
  within that department, if one was not made by the DOD.\n                \n                \r\n\n
  \           \n                Hunter, in the letter, called for a “thorough and
  substantive review” of the FBI’s alleged involvement. He also questioned what authority
  the FBI had to pursue Bergdahl’s release since he was a uniformed service member
  and not a civilian.\n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                “We’re
  going to try to get to the bottom of it,” Kasper said Monday.\n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                He said a chief concern is that
  the FBI is not necessarily equipped to recover Americans held captive in hostile
  areas.\n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                “They
  don’t have the assets. They don’t have the resources,” he said.\n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                The U.S. government as a matter
  of policy does not pay ransom for terror hostages, and Kasper acknowledged the administration
  will never confirm a “ransom” was paid in this case. But he suggested the government
  could have offered a payment of some kind – without calling it a ransom. \n                \n

  \           \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tThe FBI played a central role in making a botched
  “payment” meant to help secure Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl’s release last year, according
  to the office of a House Republican now seeking answers on why the bureau was involved
  at all in the apparent rescue attempt.  Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif. -- who has
  long questioned whether a ransom of some kind was offered for Bergdahl’s release
  -- claimed in a recent letter to the Justice Department inspector general that he
  has learned “non-DoD organizations, led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),
  undertook the recovery mission.”As part of this effort, Hunter told DOJ IG Michael
  Horowitz, the FBI even went to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and “awaited Bergdahl’s
  arrival following some form of discussion about facilitating a payment.”Bergdahl
  didn’t show – and ultimately was not released until May when he was traded for five
  Taliban leaders. Hunter’s chief of staff, Joe Kasper, told FoxNews.com the unsuccessful
  FBI border visit came after this operation paid an Afghan intermediary, who then
  ran off with the money.“The FBI was leading the op,” Kasper said. Hunter now wants
  the DOJ IG to look into the alleged payment, including the amount and whether it
  was made in violation of the law. A representative with the FBI did not comment
  on Hunter’s claims when asked by FoxNews.com. Hunter previously has said such a
  botched payment was made and initially pointed the finger at Joint Special Operations
  Command, but has not discussed the extent of the FBI’s alleged role until now. Hunter’s
  claims were first reported in The Daily Beast. The letter to Horowitz comes after
  the House Armed Services Committee released a detailed report saying the Defense
  Department inspector general could not confirm that any payment was made in an effort
  to recover Bergdahl, whose desertion case was referred Monday to a general court-martial.
  All the DOD IG could confirm was that “small payments were made to individuals in
  return for information” on Bergdahl’s captors, whereabouts and condition. The Pentagon
  last year also denied that a ransom was paid.But Hunter’s letter shifts the focus
  to the DOJ and FBI.It asks the Justice Department inspector general to look at whether
  a payment was made from within that department, if one was not made by the DOD.Hunter,
  in the letter, called for a “thorough and substantive review” of the FBI’s alleged
  involvement. He also questioned what authority the FBI had to pursue Bergdahl’s
  release since he was a uniformed service member and not a civilian.“We’re going
  to try to get to the bottom of it,” Kasper said Monday.He said a chief concern is
  that the FBI is not necessarily equipped to recover Americans held captive in hostile
  areas.“They don’t have the assets. They don’t have the resources,” he said.The U.S.
  government as a matter of policy does not pay ransom for terror hostages, and Kasper
  acknowledged the administration will never confirm a “ransom” was paid in this case.
  But he suggested the government could have offered a payment of some kind – without
  calling it a ransom. AdvertisementAdvertisement©2015 FOX News Network, LLC. All
