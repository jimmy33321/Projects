  essentially talking about Ferraris. The highest sales of any big auction-fest like
  Scottsdale or Monterey are almost inevitably Ferraris, and any big sale from one
  of the major catalogue auction houses seems to have at least half a dozen of them.
  Looking at Ferraris from the 1950s and 1960s, arguably the company’s best years,
  anyone with functional eyesight will find many of Ferrari’s creations breathtakingly
  gorgeous, while their painfully low production numbers and spine-tingling V-12 exhaust
  notes have also ensured their long-term collectability and sky-high values. \n"
- "Just as important, though, is what has made Ferrari the king of the collector car
  market: the fact that they’ve also been king of the race track, and the link between
  Ferrari’s racing cars and its road-going products has always been a clear one. Three
  of the cars on the following list are racing cars, while the others are road cars
  that nevertheless have significant racing heritage. While the Prancing Horse badge
  has always been expensive and Ferrari ownership has always been an exclusive experience,
  certain models take expense and exclusivity to the highest level; that is, an eight-figure
  price tag. \n"
- "1962 Ferrari 250 GTOBonhams Quail Lodge 2014 Sold for $38,115,000 \n"
- "GTOs won the World Sportscar Championship for Ferrari three years running from
  1962 to 1964. Racing icons drove them to numerous wins, the cars were powered by
  one of Ferrari’s all-time great engines, and their Scaglietti bodies are considered
  one of the most elegant designs in the history of the automobile. And with only
  three dozen GTOs built, you have the recipe for the bluest of blue chip collector
  cars. GTO ownership is also a close-knit affair, because on the rare occasion one
  does sell, it usually does so privately. The last GTO to come up for auction was
  way back in 2000, so when this example showed up in Monterey last year it grabbed
  headlines. Some speculated that it would go as high as $70 million, but in the end
  this GTO (which had crashed in period and unfortunately killed its driver) brought
  just under $40 million. That was still enough to smash the previous all-time auction
  record, taken a few months earlier by a 1955 Mercedes-Benz W196 Grand Prix car,
  by almost $10 million. \n"

- "With just 10 built, the NART Spider takes the word “rare” to another level. The
  car came about when U.S. Ferrari importer Luigi Chinetti convinced Ferrari to cut
  the roof off of the 275 GTB coupe, because Americans just love their open cars,
  don’t they? The result was a drool-inducing spider that would be a star in even
  the biggest car collection. Another NART Spider finished second in class at Sebring
  in 1967, but this one had the important distinction of single-family ownership,
  and proceeds from the sale all went to charity. What’s bidding like on a car this
  expensive? It opened at $10 million, immediately jumped to $16 million, and after
  $20 million it went on in $1 million increments to the final price. That's one way
  to do it. \n"
- " \n"
- "1964 Ferrari 275 GTB/C SpecialeRM Monterey 2014 Sold for $26,400,000 \n"
- "A year after that NART Spider in Monterey, RM came back with this 275 GTB/C Speciale,
  which actually surprised a lot of people when it crossed the block. It’s the first
  of three built by Ferrari, and while one did finish third at Le Mans in 1965, this
  car had no significant history; its first owner actually used it as a road car.
  Enough people just had to have it, though, and bidding reached stratospheric levels
  - about $1 million less than the arguably more significant NART Spider from the
  year before. \n"
- " \n"
- "1961 Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider (closed headlight)Artcurial Paris 2015
  Sold for $18,405,440 \n"
- "This Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider was part of the barn find to end all
  barn finds. Housed with dozens of highly collectible automobiles in a group of dilapidated
  buildings in Western France as part of the forgotten Roger Baillon Collection, the
  Ferrari is one of 37 made and has the desirable covered headlights that can, believe
  it or not, add millions in value over open-headlight cars. Artcurial, the auction
  house that sold the car, made a brilliant PR move by circulating pictures of it
  being “uncovered’ in a shed from beneath a giant pile of old magazines. That enhanced
  the car’s “buried treasure” mystique and helped to bring a record price that is
  significantly higher than any of the other shiny, restored California Spiders that
  have sold in the past few years. \n"
- " \n"
- "1954 Ferrari 375 PlusBonhams Goodwood Festival of Speed 2014 Sold for $18,315,846
  \n"
- "Ferrari’s mighty 4.9-liter 375 Plus is one of the greats from racing’s “golden
  era” in the 1950s and a car that won races on both sides of the Atlantic, including
  Le Mans in 1954. Six were built, and Ralph Lauren has one of them. This one had
  been part of an international legal battle, as parts of the car had been stolen
  in the 1980s, and there was dispute as to who actually owned it. None of that mattered
  to bidders, it seems, because how often does the opportunity to buy one of these
  come up? \n"

  people talk about the top end of the collector car market, they’re essentially talking
  about Ferraris. The highest sales of any big auction-fest like Scottsdale or Monterey
  are almost inevitably Ferraris, and any big sale from one of the major catalogue
  auction houses seems to have at least half a dozen of them. Looking at Ferraris
  from the 1950s and 1960s, arguably the company’s best years, anyone with functional
  eyesight will find many of Ferrari’s creations breathtakingly gorgeous, while their
  painfully low production numbers and spine-tingling V-12 exhaust notes have also
  ensured their long-term collectability and sky-high values. \nJust as important,
  though, is what has made Ferrari the king of the collector car market: the fact
  that they’ve also been king of the race track, and the link between Ferrari’s racing
  cars and its road-going products has always been a clear one. Three of the cars
  on the following list are racing cars, while the others are road cars that nevertheless
  have significant racing heritage. While the Prancing Horse badge has always been
  expensive and Ferrari ownership has always been an exclusive experience, certain
  models take expense and exclusivity to the highest level; that is, an eight-figure
  price tag. \n1962 Ferrari 250 GTOBonhams Quail Lodge 2014 Sold for $38,115,000 \nGTOs
  won the World Sportscar Championship for Ferrari three years running from 1962 to
  1964. Racing icons drove them to numerous wins, the cars were powered by one of
  Ferrari’s all-time great engines, and their Scaglietti bodies are considered one
  of the most elegant designs in the history of the automobile. And with only three
  dozen GTOs built, you have the recipe for the bluest of blue chip collector cars.
  GTO ownership is also a close-knit affair, because on the rare occasion one does
  sell, it usually does so privately. The last GTO to come up for auction was way
  back in 2000, so when this example showed up in Monterey last year it grabbed headlines.
  Some speculated that it would go as high as $70 million, but in the end this GTO
  (which had crashed in period and unfortunately killed its driver) brought just under
  $40 million. That was still enough to smash the previous all-time auction record,
  taken a few months earlier by a 1955 Mercedes-Benz W196 Grand Prix car, by almost
  $10 million. \n\n \n1967 Ferrari 275 GTB/4 NART SpiderRM Monterey 2013 Sold for
  $27,500,000 \nWith just 10 built, the NART Spider takes the word “rare” to another
  level. The car came about when U.S. Ferrari importer Luigi Chinetti convinced Ferrari
  to cut the roof off of the 275 GTB coupe, because Americans just love their open
  cars, don’t they? The result was a drool-inducing spider that would be a star in
  even the biggest car collection. Another NART Spider finished second in class at
  Sebring in 1967, but this one had the important distinction of single-family ownership,
  and proceeds from the sale all went to charity. What’s bidding like on a car this
  expensive? It opened at $10 million, immediately jumped to $16 million, and after
  $20 million it went on in $1 million increments to the final price. That's one way
  to do it. \n \n1964 Ferrari 275 GTB/C SpecialeRM Monterey 2014 Sold for $26,400,000
  \nA year after that NART Spider in Monterey, RM came back with this 275 GTB/C Speciale,
  which actually surprised a lot of people when it crossed the block. It’s the first
  of three built by Ferrari, and while one did finish third at Le Mans in 1965, this
  car had no significant history; its first owner actually used it as a road car.
  Enough people just had to have it, though, and bidding reached stratospheric levels
  - about $1 million less than the arguably more significant NART Spider from the
  year before. \n \n1961 Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider (closed headlight)Artcurial
  Paris 2015 Sold for $18,405,440 \nThis Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider was
  part of the barn find to end all barn finds. Housed with dozens of highly collectible
  automobiles in a group of dilapidated buildings in Western France as part of the
  forgotten Roger Baillon Collection, the Ferrari is one of 37 made and has the desirable
  covered headlights that can, believe it or not, add millions in value over open-headlight
  cars. Artcurial, the auction house that sold the car, made a brilliant PR move by
  circulating pictures of it being “uncovered’ in a shed from beneath a giant pile
  of old magazines. That enhanced the car’s “buried treasure” mystique and helped
  to bring a record price that is significantly higher than any of the other shiny,
  restored California Spiders that have sold in the past few years. \n \n1954 Ferrari
  375 PlusBonhams Goodwood Festival of Speed 2014 Sold for $18,315,846 \nFerrari’s
  mighty 4.9-liter 375 Plus is one of the greats from racing’s “golden era” in the
  1950s and a car that won races on both sides of the Atlantic, including Le Mans
  in 1954. Six were built, and Ralph Lauren has one of them. This one had been part
  of an international legal battle, as parts of the car had been stolen in the 1980s,
  and there was dispute as to who actually owned it. None of that mattered to bidders,
  it seems, because how often does the opportunity to buy one of these come up? \nClick
