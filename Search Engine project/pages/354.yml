  the most exciting areas of science, the study of human evolution. Despite strong
  public interest in the science, however, many people find this topic troubling when
  viewed from a religious perspective. Representatives of diverse religious communities
  encourage a larger, more respectful understanding of both the scientific evidence

- |2
             When our back molars are impacted in our jaw, they don’t seem very wise! They’re the last teeth to come into place, and having them was helpful to our early ancestors who ate tough, uncooked foods that wore away their teeth. But with cooking and making food softer, the size of our jaws has diminished, often with room for the last molars to form in the jaw…but – ouch! – not enough room to erupt.

- "          Our big hungry brain!    \n"
- "            Did you know that your brain makes up about 2% of your body weight…but
  uses about 20-25% of your body’s total energy, just for its basic activity? That’s
  one hungry brain!  No wonder it’s good to eat nutritious foods that offer a lot
  of energy. The brain of a newborn baby is even more amazing, as it takes up about
  60% of the baby’s energy as the brain grows at an astonishing pace. \n"

            The amazing story of adaptation and survival in our species, Homo sapiens, is written in the language of our genes, in every cell of our bodies—as well as in the fossil and behavioral evidence. Explore the African origins of modern humans about 200,000 years ago and celebrate our species’ epic journey around the world in this video: “One Species, Living Worldwide".

- 'cpp_value="HUMAN";Fieldwork at Olorgesailie, Kenya, seeks to understand the life
  and times of early humans in the East African Rift Valley over the past 1 million
  years.Research on the island of Flores, Indonesia, helps unravel the life and extinction
  of the smallest and most enigmatic fossil human species.The Hall of Human Origins offers
  a welcoming place to explore one of the most exciting areas of science, the study
  of human evolution. Despite strong public interest in the science, however, many
  people find this topic troubling when viewed from a religious perspective. Representatives
  of diverse religious communities encourage a larger, more respectful understanding
  of both the scientific evidence and religious belief.When our back molars are impacted
  in our jaw, they don’t seem very wise! They’re the last teeth to come into place,
  and having them was helpful to our early ancestors who ate tough, uncooked foods
  that wore away their teeth. But with cooking and making food softer, the size of
  our jaws has diminished, often with room for the last molars to form in the jaw…but
  – ouch! – not enough room to erupt. Did you know that your brain makes up about
  2% of your body weight…but uses about 20-25% of your body’s total energy, just for
  its basic activity? That’s one hungry brain!  No wonder it’s good to eat nutritious
  foods that offer a lot of energy. The brain of a newborn baby is even more amazing,
  as it takes up about 60% of the baby’s energy as the brain grows at an astonishing
  pace.Are you interested in joining a discussion forum exclusively for educators involved
  in teaching human evolution? We encourage you to participate in our Teachers Forum
  and share your insights, questions, best practices, and experiences with other like-minded
  educators.The amazing story of adaptation and survival in our species, Homo sapiens, is
  written in the language of our genes, in every cell of our bodies—as well as in
  the fossil and behavioral evidence. Explore the African origins of modern humans
  about 200,000 years ago and celebrate our species’ epic journey around the world
  in this video: “One Species, Living Worldwide".Dr. Rick Potts provides a video short
  introduction to some of the evidence for human evolution, in the form of fossils
  and artifacts.© Copyright Smithsonian InstitutionSite Last Updated: 2015-12-11'

  \         Human Evolution: Religious Perspectives    \n           The Hall of Human
  Origins offers a welcoming place to explore one of the most exciting areas of science,
  the study of human evolution. Despite strong public interest in the science, however,
  many people find this topic troubling when viewed from a religious perspective.
  Representatives of diverse religious communities encourage a larger, more respectful
  understanding of both the scientific evidence and religious belief.     \n    \n

  teeth?    \n           When our back molars are impacted in our jaw, they don’t
  seem very wise! They’re the last teeth to come into place, and having them was helpful
  to our early ancestors who ate tough, uncooked foods that wore away their teeth.
  But with cooking and making food softer, the size of our jaws has diminished, often
  with room for the last molars to form in the jaw…but – ouch! – not enough room to
  erupt.\n     \n  \n      \n          Our big hungry brain!    \n            Did
  you know that your brain makes up about 2% of your body weight…but uses about 20-25%
  of your body’s total energy, just for its basic activity? That’s one hungry brain! 
  No wonder it’s good to eat nutritious foods that offer a lot of energy. The brain
  of a newborn baby is even more amazing, as it takes up about 60% of the baby’s energy
  as the brain grows at an astonishing pace. \n     \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n

  to understand the life and times of early humans in the East African Rift Valley

  unravel the life and extinction of the smallest and most enigmatic fossil human
  species.The Hall of Human Origins offers a welcoming place to explore one of the
  most exciting areas of science, the study of human evolution. Despite strong public
  interest in the science, however, many people find this topic troubling when viewed
  from a religious perspective. Representatives of diverse religious communities encourage
  a larger, more respectful understanding of both the scientific evidence and religious
  belief.When our back molars are impacted in our jaw, they don’t seem very wise!
  They’re the last teeth to come into place, and having them was helpful to our early
  ancestors who ate tough, uncooked foods that wore away their teeth. But with cooking
  and making food softer, the size of our jaws has diminished, often with room for
  the last molars to form in the jaw…but – ouch! – not enough room to erupt. Did you
  know that your brain makes up about 2% of your body weight…but uses about 20-25%
  of your body’s total energy, just for its basic activity? That’s one hungry brain! 
  No wonder it’s good to eat nutritious foods that offer a lot of energy. The brain
  of a newborn baby is even more amazing, as it takes up about 60% of the baby’s energy
  as the brain grows at an astonishing pace.Are you interested in joining a discussion
  forum exclusively for educators involved in teaching human evolution? We encourage you
  to participate in our Teachers Forum and share your insights, questions, best practices,
  and experiences with other like-minded educators.The amazing story of adaptation
  and survival in our species, Homo sapiens, is written in the language of our genes,
  in every cell of our bodies—as well as in the fossil and behavioral evidence. Explore
  the African origins of modern humans about 200,000 years ago and celebrate our species’
  epic journey around the world in this video: “One Species, Living Worldwide\".Dr.
  Rick Potts provides a video short introduction to some of the evidence for human
  evolution, in the form of fossils and artifacts.© Copyright Smithsonian InstitutionSite
