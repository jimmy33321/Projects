- "\t\t\t\t\t\tThe first 911 caller reported seeing a man walking down a street shooting
  a gun in the air. Authorities said they received five more similar calls from witnesses
  alarmed by what they saw. \n"
- "Responding Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies told the man to drop the weapon,
  investigators said. When he refused and started toward a gas station where a family
  was pumping gas, they opened fire, killing the man. \n"
- "Video captured the encounter Saturday in the South Los Angeles suburb of Lynwood,
  clearly showing Nicholas Robertson, 28, carrying a gun, crossing the street and
  deputies opening fire. \n"
- "Investigators said in all, deputies fired 33 times at Robertson. \n"
- |
  "When he collapsed, his arms were underneath him, and the gun was still in his hand. There was never a time when the weapon was not in his possession," homicide Capt. Steven Katz said Sunday in response to questions about why the deputies kept shooting the man after he fell.
- " \n"
- "Authorities released a close-up from security footage showing Robertson stretched
  out on the ground with a gun in his hand. \n"
- "Robertson, who was black, was killed as police use of force draws increasing criticism
  after several deaths of black men by officers have been caught on video in California
  and throughout the nation. \n"
- "The deputies confronted Robertson as they investigated 911 calls from the witnesses
  who said a man was walking down a residential street and then through a busy commercial
  area holding a weapon and acting strangely. \n"
- "Witnesses told authorities that Robertson fired six to seven rounds and briefly
  went into a car wash and a pizza parlor before deputies arrived. \n"
- "The deputies spotted him in front of a gas station, where two women and three children
  were inside a car, and ordered him to drop the gun, Katz said. Robertson refused
  and at one point pointed the gun in the deputies' direction, Katz added. \n"
- "He said the gun was not loaded but that detectives found two live rounds \"in his
  grasp.\" The gun was not registered to Robertson and has not been reported stolen.
  Detectives are trying to track it, Katz said. \n"
- "Robertson may have been in a dispute with his spouse at home before he went out
  on the street, but authorities have yet to verify that report, Katz said. \n"
- "Robertson's wife told the Los Angeles Times that her mother-in-law had called her
  shortly before the shooting to say Nicholas Robertson was under the influence of
  alcohol. Nekesha Robertson said she was on her way to get him and had stopped at
  the same gas station to buy milk before the shooting. \n"
- "Nekesha Robertson said her husband was a stay-at-home father devoted to the couple's
  7-year-old daughter and 6-year-old twins -- a boy and a girl -- and was not a criminal.
  \n"
- "\"Anytime you see him, you see him with the kids,\" she said. \"He'd take them
  to and from school. Help them with homework. He's a daddy -- that's his job. He
  didn't do nothing else.\" \n"
- "Other family members said the shooting was not justified and that Robertson may
  not have heard the deputies' command to drop the gun. \n"
- "\"This man never turned at you and looked at you or pointed the gun at you. Nothing,\"
  said Nekesha Robertson's cousin, Monica Reddix. \"What they did yesterday was ...
  point-blank murder.\" \n"
- "Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell promised the investigation into Robertson's
  death would be handled \"with the utmost professionalism and integrity\" and urged
  anyone with information to come forward. \n"
- "\"There's gonna be criticism anytime there's a deputy-involved shooting. We've
  seen that in the last two years or so, the sentiment across America has been critical,\"
  McDonnell said. \"That's why we ... try to be as transparent as we can with the
  information that we can share.\" \n"
- |
  Robertson's death came the same month that five San Francisco officers shot and killed Mario Woods, 26, after they say he refused commands to drop an 8-inch knife. Police were responding to a stabbing report Dec. 2 when they encountered Woods. Several bystanders filmed the shooting, and their videos circulated online widely.

- Sign in to comment!The first 911 caller reported seeing a man walking down a street
  shooting a gun in the air. Authorities said they received five more similar calls
  from witnesses alarmed by what they saw.Responding Los Angeles County sheriff's
  deputies told the man to drop the weapon, investigators said. When he refused and
  started toward a gas station where a family was pumping gas, they opened fire, killing
  the man.Video captured the encounter Saturday in the South Los Angeles suburb of
  Lynwood, clearly showing Nicholas Robertson, 28, carrying a gun, crossing the street
  and deputies opening fire.Investigators said in all, deputies fired 33 times at
  Robertson."When he collapsed, his arms were underneath him, and the gun was still
  in his hand. There was never a time when the weapon was not in his possession,"
  homicide Capt. Steven Katz said Sunday in response to questions about why the deputies
  kept shooting the man after he fell.Authorities released a close-up from security
  footage showing Robertson stretched out on the ground with a gun in his hand.Robertson,
  who was black, was killed as police use of force draws increasing criticism after
  several deaths of black men by officers have been caught on video in California
  and throughout the nation.The deputies confronted Robertson as they investigated
  911 calls from the witnesses who said a man was walking down a residential street
  and then through a busy commercial area holding a weapon and acting strangely.Witnesses
  told authorities that Robertson fired six to seven rounds and briefly went into
  a car wash and a pizza parlor before deputies arrived.The deputies spotted him in
  front of a gas station, where two women and three children were inside a car, and
  ordered him to drop the gun, Katz said. Robertson refused and at one point pointed
  the gun in the deputies' direction, Katz added.He said the gun was not loaded but
  that detectives found two live rounds "in his grasp." The gun was not registered
  to Robertson and has not been reported stolen. Detectives are trying to track it,
  Katz said.Robertson may have been in a dispute with his spouse at home before he
  went out on the street, but authorities have yet to verify that report, Katz said.Robertson's
  wife told the Los Angeles Times that her mother-in-law had called her shortly before
  the shooting to say Nicholas Robertson was under the influence of alcohol. Nekesha
  Robertson said she was on her way to get him and had stopped at the same gas station
  to buy milk before the shooting.Nekesha Robertson said her husband was a stay-at-home
  father devoted to the couple's 7-year-old daughter and 6-year-old twins -- a boy
  and a girl -- and was not a criminal."Anytime you see him, you see him with the
  kids," she said. "He'd take them to and from school. Help them with homework. He's
  a daddy -- that's his job. He didn't do nothing else."Other family members said
  the shooting was not justified and that Robertson may not have heard the deputies'
  command to drop the gun."This man never turned at you and looked at you or pointed
  the gun at you. Nothing," said Nekesha Robertson's cousin, Monica Reddix. "What
  they did yesterday was ... point-blank murder."Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell
  promised the investigation into Robertson's death would be handled "with the utmost
  professionalism and integrity" and urged anyone with information to come forward."There's
  gonna be criticism anytime there's a deputy-involved shooting. We've seen that in
  the last two years or so, the sentiment across America has been critical," McDonnell
  said. "That's why we ... try to be as transparent as we can with the information
  that we can share."Robertson's death came the same month that five San Francisco
  officers shot and killed Mario Woods, 26, after they say he refused commands to
  drop an 8-inch knife. Police were responding to a stabbing report Dec. 2 when they
  encountered Woods. Several bystanders filmed the shooting, and their videos circulated
  online widely.AdvertisementAdvertisementThis material may not be published, broadcast,

  \  \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe first 911 caller reported
  seeing a man walking down a street shooting a gun in the air. Authorities said they
  received five more similar calls from witnesses alarmed by what they saw. \nResponding
  Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies told the man to drop the weapon, investigators
  said. When he refused and started toward a gas station where a family was pumping
  gas, they opened fire, killing the man. \nVideo captured the encounter Saturday
  in the South Los Angeles suburb of Lynwood, clearly showing Nicholas Robertson,
  28, carrying a gun, crossing the street and deputies opening fire. \nInvestigators
  said in all, deputies fired 33 times at Robertson. \n\"When he collapsed, his arms
  were underneath him, and the gun was still in his hand. There was never a time when
  the weapon was not in his possession,\" homicide Capt. Steven Katz said Sunday in
  response to questions about why the deputies kept shooting the man after he fell.\n
  \nAuthorities released a close-up from security footage showing Robertson stretched
  out on the ground with a gun in his hand. \nRobertson, who was black, was killed
  as police use of force draws increasing criticism after several deaths of black
  men by officers have been caught on video in California and throughout the nation.
  \nThe deputies confronted Robertson as they investigated 911 calls from the witnesses
  who said a man was walking down a residential street and then through a busy commercial
  area holding a weapon and acting strangely. \nWitnesses told authorities that Robertson
  fired six to seven rounds and briefly went into a car wash and a pizza parlor before
  deputies arrived. \nThe deputies spotted him in front of a gas station, where two
  women and three children were inside a car, and ordered him to drop the gun, Katz
  said. Robertson refused and at one point pointed the gun in the deputies' direction,
  Katz added. \nHe said the gun was not loaded but that detectives found two live
  rounds \"in his grasp.\" The gun was not registered to Robertson and has not been
  reported stolen. Detectives are trying to track it, Katz said. \nRobertson may have
  been in a dispute with his spouse at home before he went out on the street, but
  authorities have yet to verify that report, Katz said. \nRobertson's wife told the
  Los Angeles Times that her mother-in-law had called her shortly before the shooting
  to say Nicholas Robertson was under the influence of alcohol. Nekesha Robertson
  said she was on her way to get him and had stopped at the same gas station to buy
  milk before the shooting. \nNekesha Robertson said her husband was a stay-at-home
  father devoted to the couple's 7-year-old daughter and 6-year-old twins -- a boy
  and a girl -- and was not a criminal. \n\"Anytime you see him, you see him with
  the kids,\" she said. \"He'd take them to and from school. Help them with homework.
  He's a daddy -- that's his job. He didn't do nothing else.\" \nOther family members
  said the shooting was not justified and that Robertson may not have heard the deputies'
  command to drop the gun. \n\"This man never turned at you and looked at you or pointed
  the gun at you. Nothing,\" said Nekesha Robertson's cousin, Monica Reddix. \"What
  they did yesterday was ... point-blank murder.\" \nLos Angeles County Sheriff Jim
  McDonnell promised the investigation into Robertson's death would be handled \"with
  the utmost professionalism and integrity\" and urged anyone with information to
  come forward. \n\"There's gonna be criticism anytime there's a deputy-involved shooting.
  We've seen that in the last two years or so, the sentiment across America has been
  critical,\" McDonnell said. \"That's why we ... try to be as transparent as we can
  with the information that we can share.\" \nRobertson's death came the same month
  that five San Francisco officers shot and killed Mario Woods, 26, after they say
  he refused commands to drop an 8-inch knife. Police were responding to a stabbing
  report Dec. 2 when they encountered Woods. Several bystanders filmed the shooting,
  and their videos circulated online widely.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n \n   Advertisement\n\t

  influence of alcohol. Nekesha Robertson said she was on her way to get him and had
  stopped at the same gas station to buy milk before the shooting.Nekesha Robertson
  said her husband was a stay-at-home father devoted to the couple's 7-year-old daughter
  and 6-year-old twins -- a boy and a girl -- and was not a criminal.\"Anytime you
  see him, you see him with the kids,\" she said. \"He'd take them to and from school.
  Help them with homework. He's a daddy -- that's his job. He didn't do nothing else.\"Other
  family members said the shooting was not justified and that Robertson may not have
  heard the deputies' command to drop the gun.\"This man never turned at you and looked
  at you or pointed the gun at you. Nothing,\" said Nekesha Robertson's cousin, Monica
  Reddix. \"What they did yesterday was ... point-blank murder.\"Los Angeles County
  Sheriff Jim McDonnell promised the investigation into Robertson's death would be
  handled \"with the utmost professionalism and integrity\" and urged anyone with
  information to come forward.\"There's gonna be criticism anytime there's a deputy-involved
  shooting. We've seen that in the last two years or so, the sentiment across America
  has been critical,\" McDonnell said. \"That's why we ... try to be as transparent
  as we can with the information that we can share.\"Robertson's death came the same
  month that five San Francisco officers shot and killed Mario Woods, 26, after they
  say he refused commands to drop an 8-inch knife. Police were responding to a stabbing
  report Dec. 2 when they encountered Woods. Several bystanders filmed the shooting,
  and their videos circulated online widely.AdvertisementAdvertisementThis material
