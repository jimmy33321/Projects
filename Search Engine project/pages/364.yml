  The Frontiers
- |2+

- "At mid-twentieth century, when the second great world war \n"
- "ended, the United States enjoyed wealth and prosperity \n"
- "unknown in foreign lands and rose to a summit of power. \n"
- "The interests and influence of Americans extended far from \n"
- "home. Their commerce was carried by merchant ships and \n"
- "aircraft to distant cities. The dollar was the standard of \n"
- "international finance and the credits of American banks \n"
- "flowed everywhere. Food, clothing, movies, machines, and \n"
- "science made the American name known throughout the \n"
- "world. The people shared their fortune by distributing \n"
- "charitable aid abroad in quantities without precedent. As \n"
- "after earlier wars in their history, their citizen-soldiers were \n"
- "disbanded and sent home. Yet the government pledged to \n"
- "defend friendly states and kept units of its undefeated army \n"
- "in strategic outposts, sea power that patrolled the oceans, \n"
- "and an air force that guarded the sky. It was a time of general \n"
- "peace and faraway local conflicts; no third world war \n"
- "erupted. The United States kept an order favorable to its \n"
- "allies and demonstrated its art of trade and ways of culture \n"
- |
  and modern living to aged societies.
- |2+

- "The frontiers of American interest that came to gird the \n"
- "world began with the first colonial settlements huddled along \n"
- "the Atlantic coast. At independence in 1783, the United \n"
- "States took possession of forest and lake lands westward to \n"
- "the Mississippi River. In 1803 it expanded across the Great \n"
- "Plains of the Louisiana Territory as far as the Rocky \n"
- "Mountains. In 1819 it gained the Florida peninsula. The \n"
- "flatlands of Texas were incorporated into the Union in 1846, \n"
- "as were the forests of Oregon. At the conclusion of the war \n"
- "with Mexico in 1848, the United States won the \n"
- "southwestern desert regions, the Rocky Mountains, and the \n"
- "western coastal slopes all the way to the Pacific Ocean, \n"
- "leaving only minor adjustments, such as the wedge-shaped \n"
- "Gadsden Purchase in the Southwest, to fill out its linear \n"
- |
  boundaries.
- |2+

- "Through treaties, commitments, and unilateral \n"
- "declarations, the United States made allies with far-flung \n"
- "countries in areas where the interests of American trade, \n"
- "philanthropy, culture, and security were often greater than \n"
- "those of any other power, and the boundaries of some \n"
- "distant lands became the frontiers of these interests. These \n"
- "foreign affiliations first covered the Western Hemisphere. \n"
- |
  As early as 1823 President James Monroe proclaimed influence
- "over both North and South America by opposing European control or meddling. \n"
- "Here the frontiers stood, for the most part, until around the end of the nineteenth
  \n"
- "century, when in a burst of expansive energy the United States consolidated its
  \n"
- "hemispheric interests by taking colonies in the West Indies: Puerto Rico, occupied
  by \n"
- "troops in the Spanish-American War in 1898, and the Virgin Islands, purchased from
  \n"
- "Denmark in World War I. The Panama Canal Zone came under the jurisdiction of the
  \n"
- "United States in 1903. To the west the United States extended its possessions deep
  into \n"
- "the Pacific Ocean, from Alaska, owned since 1867, to the Hawaiian islands and the
  \n"
- "Philippines in 1898. To connect the American mainland with the Far East, the United
  \n"
- |
  States quickly gained as outposts the islands of Guam and Samoa.
- |2+

- "At the turn of the century, the area Americans had committed themselves to defend
  \n"
- "covered the Western Hemisphere and far beyond: on the Atlantic side, from Greenland
  to \n"
- "Brazil to Tierra del Fuego at the southern tip of South America; and on the Pacific
  side, \n"
- "across the world's largest ocean from Alaska to the Philippines. This area of security,
  \n"
- "Walter Lippmann calculated in 1943, comprised nearly 40 percent of the land surface
  of \n"
- |
  the earth. There it remained until World War II.
- |2+

- "The outer reach of American interest grew into distant zones once dominated by
  the \n"
- "empires of the Old World. The frontiers were never precisely defined, though they
  could \n"
- "be seen in the country's overseas wars and the visible remnants of its military
  bases, \n"
- "airstrips, and patrol roads. Other evidence of the frontiers was invisible: trade,
  cultural \n"
- "diffusion, and diplomatic commitments. After World War I, American interest in
  Britain, \n"
- "France, and Germany dwelled more on the export of products and investment than
  on \n"
- "political order or military force. Early in World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt
  \n"
- "denied reports that he had said the American frontier ran along the Rhine River.
  But he \n"
- "made no secret of his belief that American interests lay along the German border,
  for he \n"
- "feared that if the lands adjacent to the Rhine, which flowed through the industrial
  heart \n"
- "of Western Europe, came under the domination of a hostile totalitarian power, American
  \n"
- "trade and security would be weakened. The Western Hemisphere would be a besieged
  \n"
- |
  island.
- |2+

- "After victory in the European war, the United States quickly established \n"
- "occupation bases in Germany, and its frontier of interest penetrated deep into
  Europe. In \n"
- "March 1946, former Prime Minister Winston Churchill, accompanied by President \n"
- "Harry Truman, delivered a speech at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, that
  \n"
- "defined the new area within which the United States was obliged to assert its power.
  \n"
- "This area came up against regions held by Soviet Russia, which had brought down
  a \n"
- "communist \"iron curtain\" running from the Baltic Sea across the Eurasian plain
  to the \n"
- |
  Adriatic.
- |2+

- "A year later Truman in effect extended this frontier of interest from the Adriatic
  \n"
- "across the Balkan peninsula, beyond the straits of the Dardanelles linking Europe
  with \n"
- "Asia, nearly to the edge of the Caucasus Mountains. American financial grants \n"
- "supported the borderlands of Greece and Turkey, and credits and aid flowed throughout
  \n"
- "Western Europe, even to the British Empire, so recently the major world power.
  In the \n"
- "Atlantic, where Europeans had once dominated exploration and trade, the American
  \n"
- |
  merchant marine and navy had become triumphant.
- |2+

- "In the Pacific, a defensive perimeter drawn up in January 1950 by Secretary of
  \n"
- "State Dean Acheson established a line of security running from near the tip of
  Alaska, \n"
- "southwest along the Aleutian Islands, across the sea to the islands of Japan, along
  the \n"
- "chain of the Ryukyu Islands, the largest of which was Okinawa, to the Philippines.
  The \n"
- "commitments to the East were at first not so strong, nor so well defined, as those
  to \n"
- "Europe. As an ally in the war against Japan, China had received American backing
  until \n"
- "its 1949 revolution made it a communist cohort of the Soviet Union. China then
  fell \n"
- "from favor, while the former enemy, Japan, under occupation for years by the \n"
- "American army, became a friend. Taiwan was not included behind this original \n"
- "perimeter, and it was uncertain for a time whether the lower part of Korea, south
  of \n"
- "China, was behind the line or a no-man's-land. But within the year of Acheson's
  \n"
- "expansion of the frontiers of American protection, the line fell across Korea,
  and \n"
- "American forces rushed to defend a front in the south against communist Koreans
  \n"
- "invading from the north. Far to the south lay the island continent of Australia,
  which, \n"
- |
  despite its distance, maintained close ties with America.
- |2+

- "These frontiers of influence were strengthened with the formation of a military
  \n"
- "alliance system in Western Europe in 1949 and in eastern Asia in the early 1950s.
  But \n"
- "the frontiers on opposite sides of the world did not yet connect. To complete the
  \n"
- "circle, the United States gained allies in the 1950s among the nations of southern
  Asia, \n"
- "where political frontiers or perimeters were intermittently broken or lacked firmness.
  \n"
- "The line of influence extended through Southeast Asia, including South Vietnam,
  Laos, \n"
- "and Cambodia. It continued along the northern boundaries of divided Pakistan, Iran,
  \n"
- "and Turkey, though India and Burma declared neutrality after gaining independence
  \n"
- "from Great Britain. The frontier was buttressed by rugged natural barriers that
  ran the \n"
- "length of the Himalaya range from the Khyber Pass, past the gates of India, to
  the \n"
- "southern shores of the Caspian Sea, around the great deserts above the Persian
  Gulf, \n"
- |
  to, once again, the Caucasus, the Dardanelles, and Europe.
- |2+

- "Such was the state of the frontiers of American interest as they developed from
  \n"
- "World War II into the 1950s. They were not the borders of an empire that held \n"
- "territory under a single sovereign authority. The United States was a republic
  and its \n"
- "principal means of establishing influence were aid, commerce, and diplomacy, though
  it \n"
- "came to offer protection against belligerents. It assumed the role of a primary
  power \n"
- "for which no other could substitute. Along the frontiers of this defensive area,
  the \n"
- "Americans confronted a revolutionary and mighty adversary, the Russians, and their
  \n"
- |
  massive nation with adjacent satellites.
- |2+

- "To the allied states along this frontier, the promise of American aid and defense
  \n"
- "reached, and from those lands this influence was never to retreat under coercion
  of \n"
- "aggressors. On the European frontier the American pledge had no foreseeable end:
  \n"
- "\"continuous,\" declared the treaty that united under American protection the Western
  \n"
- "European empires of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Denmark. In
  the \n"
- "Pacific, to the Philippines, and later to Australia and New Zealand, the American
  \n"
- "commitments would remain in force \"indefinitely.\" As for Japan, no change in
  its \n"
- "deference to the United States for its defense or to America's exclusive right
  to bases \n"
- "could take place without American consultation. In Southeast Asia, too, the Americans
  \n"
- "promised not to yield, and again the term \"indefinitely\" applied. American treaties
  were \n"
- "open to review by sovereign nations, but those commitments implied, no less than
  \n"
- "respect for the sovereignty of the allies, that the Americans intended never to
  surrender a \n"
- "foot of territory to aggressor nations. The Americans had never lost a war; the
  United \n"
- "States would not retreat. Where the strategic frontier lay at its farthest extent,
  in \n"
- "Southeast Asia, President Dwight Eisenhower compared the borderland to \"a leaky
  dike, \n"
- "and with leaky dikes it's sometimes better to put a finger in than to let the whole
  \n"
- |
  structure be washed away."
- |2+

- "It is these dimensions of space and time that provide a context in which the trade,
  \n"
- "cultural exchange, and battles fought in defense of American influence took place.
  Let us \n"
- "now continue not by reciting these events but rather by seeking to explain how
  and why \n"
- "a seaboard nation swelled into a world state. What are the origins of America's
  world \n"
- |
  role?
- |2+

- |
  The Problem of the Rise to World Power
- |2+

- "Americans at midcentury dealt with the glories and problems of power as the people
  of \n"
- "every preceding age had done, but their global power was distinguished by its magnitude.
  \n"
- "As World War II was drawing to a close, in late 1944 President Roosevelt reflected,
  \"At \n"
- "the end of this war this country will have the greatest material power of any Nation
  in \n"
- "the world. It will be a clean, shining America.\" He attributed America's rise
  to an \n"
- "expanding economy of peaceful production, richer than any other in skilled workers,
  and \n"
- |
  advanced in engineering, farming, business, and technological knowhow.
- |2+

- "Government officials envisioned the same exceptional rise to power. Explanations
  \n"
- "of it varied, however. Harry Hopkins, an intimate adviser to the president, agreed.
  \"We \n"
- "will emerge from this war the richest and most powerful people in the world.\"
  The \n"
- "United States alone, of all the great powers, would possess lands unscarred, a
  people \n"
- "well nourished, and a breadbasket filled to overflowing. \"We will have the largest
  navy \n"
- "and merchant fleet on the seven seas, more airplanes than any other nation. Already
  a \n"
- "technological people before the war, we will find ourselves, as the result of our
  work in \n"
- "munitions factories, with the largest army of skilled workers in history. Our industrial
  \n"
- "production capacity, vaster than the combined capacity of our Allies, will be sufficient,
  \n"
- "once converted to the uses of peace, to fill consumer needs at home and, at the
  same \n"
- "time, to supply ... heavy goods ... for rehabilitation abroad. Our raw materials
  and \n"
- "natural resources ... will be sufficient, with wise stewardship, to last for generations.
  \n"
- "But, above all, we will emerge with our democratic institutions intact, a people
  free to \n"
- |
  shape our destiny as we see fit."
- |2+

- "Soon after succeeding to the presidency, Truman made an even more ambitious \n"
- "claim for America's rise. \"We tell ourselves that we have emerged from this war,\"
  he \n"
- "remarked in a radio address in August 1945, \"the most powerful nation in the \n"
- "world--the most powerful nation, perhaps, in all history. That is true, but not
  in the \n"
- "sense some of us believe it to be true.\" The war had shown Truman that the United
  \n"
- "States had tremendous material resources, skilled workers, managers, able generals,
  and \n"
- "a brave people capable of bearing arms. \"The new thing--the thing which we had
  not \n"
- "known--the thing we have learned now and should never forget, is this: that a society
  \n"
- "of self-governing men is more powerful, more enduring, more creative than any other
  \n"
- |
  kind of society, however disciplined, however centralized."
- |2+

- "Campaigning for the presidency in his own right in 1948, Truman barnstormed the
  \n"
- "country to convey to citizens the world-changing importance of their power. He
  \n"
- "hammered away at this theme from the back platform of the presidential train and
  in \n"
- |
  big-city convention halls and stadiums:
- |2+

- |
  Salem, Oregon, June 11: "This is the greatest Nation on earth, I think. The
- |
  greatest Nation in history, let's put it that way. We have done things that no
- |
  other nation in the history of the world has done."
- |2+

- |
  Trenton, Missouri, September 18: "this country will continue for another
- |
  thousand years as the greatest country in the world."
- |2+

- |
  Dayton, Ohio, October 11: "Now, this great Republic--the greatest in history,
- |
  the greatest that the sun has ever shone upon--is charged with leadership in the
- |
  world for the welfare of the whole world as well as our own welfare."
- "Not only political leaders but also editors, columnists, and writers proclaimed
  \n"
- "America's extraordinary rise. In early 1941 Henry Luce had decided to throw the
  \n"
- "weight of his publishing empire behind an effort to explain the emergence of the
  United \n"
- "States as a dominant power. Neil MacNeil, an editor of the New York Times, stating
  in \n"
- "1944 that for a time \"the United States must remain the most powerful of world
  \n"
- "powers,\" listed American assets in a particular order: the \"most powerful navy
  that has \n"
- "ever sailed the five oceans\"; the \"biggest and hardest hitting air force that
  the world \n"
- "has ever known\"; the greatest national industrial output on earth; the largest
  merchant \n"
- "marine at sea; the largest number of transport and commercial airplanes in the
  sky; an \n"
- "agricultural plant capable of feeding Americans and contributing more than any
  other to \n"
- "feeding hungry peoples; the \"greatest national production of steel, petroleum,
  cotton \n"
- "and other vital products\"; a domain located in the Western Hemisphere; and vast
  \n"
- "holdings of monetary gold and silver. Writing in Reader's Digest, Harry Scherman,
  a \n"
- |
  popular journalist, called America simply "the most powerful nation in history."
- |2+

- "Government policy analysts examined in secret the status of national power. \n"
- "Following a request in 1948 by Secretary of Defense James Forrestal for a study
  of \"the \n"
- "proportion of our resources which should be devoted to military purposes,\" the
  National \n"
- "Security Council produced a series of reports. The most comprehensive consideration
  of \n"
- "America's possession of \"superior overall power,\" the document numbered NSC 68,
  \n"
- "which Truman approved in 1950, cited as vital components \"a unique degree of unity\"
  in \n"
- "society, \"the capability of the American economy,\" and \"military strength,\"
  including \n"
- "atomic armaments. The NSC subsequently sent a report to President Eisenhower, \n"
- "advising again that the American position as the \"leader of the free world\" was
  sustained \n"
- "by a \"strong military posture,\" a \"sound, strong and growing economy,\" and
  a high \n"
- "\"morale and free institutions,\" to which were added \"sufficient atomic weapons
  and \n"
- "effective means of delivery.\" The implication of the national security papers,
  even those \n"
- "of different administrations, was that to maintain superiority over the Soviet
  Union, the \n"
- |
  United States had to develop its assets to their maximum potential.
- |2+

- "These ideas were not entirely new. Leaders had been assessing America's rise in
  the \n"
- "world from the beginning of the Republic. In 1780 John Adams told the French foreign
  \n"
- "minister, comte de Vergennes, that the \"United States of America are a great and
  \n"
- "powerful people, whatever European statesmen may think of them.\" The country,
  \n"
- "Adams asserted, had unbounded possibilities for the future because of its enormous
  \n"
- "territorial expanse, embracing rich soil, mild climate, and incalculably plentiful
  natural \n"
- "resources, and because of the American people, rapidly expanding in numbers, and
  their \n"
- |
  production of agricultural goods for trade abroad.
- |2+

- "Yet only in the late nineteenth century did the nation become widely recognized
  as a \n"
- "world power. William McKinley was the first modern president to claim that American
  \n"
- "power was the greatest in the world. In 1892, before assuming office, he quoted
  from an \n"
- "article written fourteen years earlier by the British statesman William Gladstone
  in the \n"
- "North American Review. England and America, Gladstone said, were then \"the two
  \n"
- "strongest nations in the world, but there can hardly be a doubt as between the
  America \n"
- "and the England of the future that the daughter, at some no very distant time,
  whether \n"
- "fairer or less fair, will be unquestionably yet stronger than the mother.\" To
  McKinley \n"
- "that \"no very distant time\" suddenly arrived in the early 1890s. \"America,\"
  he said, \n"
- "\"`whether fairer or less fair'--certainly freer--is now `stronger than the mother.'\"
  \n"
- "America had become the strongest nation in the world because \"her power lies in
  a free \n"
- "and intelligent and progressive people,\" as well as in a strong, expanding economy
  and in \n"
- "social well-being. The Spanish-American War, a quick triumph resulting in the \n"
- "acquisition of an overseas empire in the Caribbean and the Pacific, dramatically
  \n"
- |
  confirmed for McKinley America's rise to world-power status.
- |2+

- "Victory in World War I revealed the enormous strength and potential of the \n"
- "industrialized continental nation. At the close of the conflict, President Woodrow
  Wilson \n"
- "stated that the United States was \"a nation as powerful as any in the world,\"
  yet it alone \n"
- "had achieved \"the primacy of the world.\" If America joined the League of Nations,
  \n"
- "Wilson declared, the country would be \"partners\" with the other powers. But,
  he added, \n"
- "\"let me predict we will be the senior partner. The financial leadership will be
  ours. The \n"
- "industrial primacy will be ours. The commercial advantage will be ours. The other
  \n"
- "countries of the world are looking to us for leadership and direction.\" Through
  the \n"
- "\"growth of our power,\" Wilson said, \"we have become a determining factor in
  the \n"
- "history of mankind.\" Industry and capital continued to grow through the 1920s,
  and so \n"
- "did the nation's economic prowess. Advances in education, science, invention, \n"
- "efficiency, and production were among the factors that led Herbert Hoover to claim
  that \n"
- |
  America had attained a "position of transcendent power."
- |2+

- "The attributes contemporaries accorded to this progress in each period were largely
  \n"
- "unanalyzed. They made lists of divergent factors--material and psychological, human
  \n"
- "and technological, peaceful and military--but these lists did not adequately distinguish
  \n"
- "one item from another. Enumerations did not indicate what was a significant \n"
- "development and what was not. We seek some structure of thought and analysis in
  an \n"
- "effort to understand why the United States became capable of exercising world \n"
- |
  influence.
- |2+

- |
  The Analysis of Power
- |2+

- "An extensive attempt to comprehend the rise and decline of nations came in a new
  \n"
- "school in international politics that emerged around the theory of power politics.
  \n"
- "Under the impetus of world war, political scientists and strategists developed
  this \n"
- "theory in the 1930s and made it popular in the 1940s, believing that it was the
  only \n"
- "realistic way to see the world; hence their common name, \"realists.\" They were
  direct \n"
- "about pursuing the national interest: a nation that abandoned self-preservation
  as the \n"
- |
  chief motive of its policy risked its very survival.
- |2+

- "One of the ablest of the early realists was Nicholas John Spykman, a political
  \n"
- "scientist at Yale, who stressed in 1942 that all civilized life rested \"in the
  last instance \n"
- "on power.\" Without power, he believed, no social progress was possible. Mechanical
  \n"
- "power--the ability to move mass--was the product of technology, and political \n"
- |
  power--the ability to move people--put technology at the service of society.
- |2+

- "Spykman was baffled as to why power had a \"bad name.\" He argued that \n"
- "Americans were wrong to condemn power as connoting evil, because power was only
  a \n"
- "means to an end. Sometimes the end was worthy, and in any case people were \n"
- "pursuing power with whole-hearted devotion. In ladies' sewing circles, he gathered,
  no \n"
- "less than in struggles between nations, power was a fact of life. A sound and practical
  \n"
- "foreign policy, Spykman stressed, should be designed \"in terms of the realities
  of \n"
- "international relations, in terms of power politics.\" Already supposed to be in
  \n"
- "possession of unquestioned hegemony over a large part of the New World, the United
  \n"
- "States, Spykman predicted, should be expected in the post-World War II era to \n"

  exercise its power in all parts of the world in pursuit of its interests.

- "A year before the close of the war, William T. R. Fox, a research associate at
  the \n"
- "Yale Institute of International Studies, gave currency to the idea of a new status
  to which \n"
- "squirrels and elephants. He was quick to explain that the Soviet Union and the
  \n"
- "Dominican Republic were not both elephants, nor were they both squirrels; and he
  \n"
- "wanted to make clear that \"we are not fighting to make them both squirrels.\"
  For Fox, the \n"
- "elephants mattered most in keeping the postwar peace. Differences in power would
  \n"
- "continue to exist among nations, he said, and the problems of the world would not
  be \n"
- "solved by endeavors to create a world of \"no-power politics.\" Fox, like Spykman,
  \n"
- "insisted that power itself was ethically neutral. He urged Americans to recognize
  that \n"
- "power was a basic feature of political life and that it made \"the most enormous
  difference \n"
- "in whose hands predominant power rests.\" After the war, he predicted, the United
  \n"
- "States would be rated as greater than a regional power restricted to a single area.
  As a \n"
- "superpower, it would have interests and influence from the East to the West. \"'Great
  \n"
- |
  power plus great mobility of power' describes the super-power," he claimed.
- |2+

- "The political scientist Hans J. Morgenthau did more than any other figure to \n"
- "establish the realist interpretation of international affairs. In 1948 he published
  his \n"
- "classic treatise Politics among Nations: The Struggle for Power and Peace, which
  argued \n"
- "that struggle for power was the essence of international affairs. Born in Germany
  in \n"
- "1904, Morgenthau fled to Switzerland to escape Hitler and in 1937 emigrated to
  the \n"
- "United States, where he found the study of international affairs disorganized.
  While \n"
- "teaching at Brooklyn College, later at the University of Kansas and, beginning
  in \n"
- "1943--the year he became a citizen--at the University of Chicago, he criticized
  the \n"
- "writing in his field by historians and international lawyers as overly legalistic
  and \n"
- "idealistic. Morgenthau brought from the Old World a pessimism about man's nature
  and \n"
- "the state of the world, while his scholarly work led him to believe that objective
  truths \n"
- "about politics could be discovered by human reason. His wealth of knowledge enabled
  \n"
- "him to lecture to his classes on world politics without a text; one of his students
  took a \n"
- |
  stenographic transcript of what he said, which became the draft of his book.
- |2+

- "Morgenthau directly related his power theories to the observation that \"the United
  \n"
- "States is at the moment of this writing the most powerful nation on earth.\" He
  was \n"
- "intrigued with the problems and rivalries this power created. \"International politics,\"
  he \n"
- "wrote, \"like all politics, is a struggle for power.\" Power was more than brutal
  force, it \n"
- "was the central aim of national interest. He proposed that the pursuit of power
  was the \n"
- "source of state behavior. No matter what the ultimate aims of nations, whether
  freedom, \n"
- "security, or prosperity, their immediate goal was power. Power was the means to
  \n"
- "national ends. Political power meant \"man's control over the minds and actions
  of other \n"
- "men.\" It followed that power was also \"a psychological relationship between those
  who \n"
- "exercise it and those over whom it is exercised,\" enabling some people to control
  the \n"
- "actions of others through orders, threats, persuasion, or a combination of these.
  Since he \n"
- "had traced the struggle for power back through history, he believed the contest
  for power \n"
- |
  must be ever-present.
- |2+

- "Morgenthau, impatient with moral sentiment or wishful idealism, believed that the
  \n"
- "pursuit of power was not necessarily immoral. \"To act successfully,\" he wrote
  in \n"
- "Scientific Man vs. Power Politics in 1946,\" ... is political wisdom. To know with
  \n"
- "despair that the political act is inevitably evil, and to act nevertheless, is
  moral courage. \n"
- "To choose among several expedient actions the least evil one is moral judgment.
  In the \n"
- "combination of political wisdom, moral courage, and moral judgment, man reconciles
  his \n"
- |
  political nature with his moral destiny."
- |2+

- "The chief opponents of the realists were the humanitarian moralists who saw the
  \n"
- "world from a different, ethical perspective. Of a longstanding tradition in the
  nineteenth \n"
- "century, the moralists included philosophers and writers who attributed America's
  rising \n"
- "world influence not to external force but to the internal example of a society.
  They \n"
- "opposed the power politics and imperialism of Europe. One of the early, clearsighted
  \n"
- "moralists was Albert Gallatin, who wrote \"The Mission of the United States\" at
  the \n"
- "time of the Mexican War. \"Your mission was, to be a model for all other governments\"
  \n"
- "and \"to apply all your faculties to the gradual improvement of your own institutions\"
  \n"
- "and, \"by your example, to exert a moral influence most beneficial to mankind at
  large. \n"
- "Instead of this, an appeal has been made to your worst passions; to cupidity, to
  the \n"
- "thirst of unjust aggrandizement by brutal force; to the love of military fame and
  of false \n"
- "glory.\" Aware that the world powers of the past had been empires and monarchies,
  the \n"
- "moralists argued that the United States should not act imperially in emulation
  of them \n"
- "but rather show the way to reform by exhibiting the success of its democratic society.
  \n"
- "Morgenthau pointed to John C. Calhoun and William Graham Sumner as worthy \n"
- "representatives of this world perspective, the latter writing during the \n"
- "Spanish-American War that \"expansionism and imperialism are at war with the best
  \n"
- |
  traditions, principles, and interests of the American people."
- |2+

- "The realists responded that in the past the moralists could afford to advocate
  that \n"
- "their nation be small and inconsequential but virtuous. After all, they had lived
  on a \n"
- "continent insulated from the outside. But their legacy threatened to damage the
  national \n"
- "interest, which required growing world involvement. Even when leaders made decisions
  \n"
- "for \"realistic\" actions, the realists contended, they had been perverted by irrelevant
  \n"
- "moralistic justifications. A case in point was President McKinley's defense of
  colonizing \n"
- "the Philippines: after prayer in the wee hours of the morning, he revealed, he
  had heard \n"
- |
  the voice of God tell him to annex the islands.
- |2+

- "Of all the spokesmen of the moralistic point of view, Woodrow Wilson was the \n"
- "most eloquent and his thought the most far-reaching. His conviction, well founded
  in \n"
- "nineteenth-century liberal thought and the ethical standards of Christian and Calvinistic
  \n"
- "theology, was that democracy and constitutional government would temper the \n"
- "maneuvers of the big powers. \"It is a very perilous thing,\" he said in an address
  in \n"
- "Mobile, Alabama, in October 1913, \"to determine the foreign policy of a nation
  in the \n"
- "terms of material interest. It not only is unfair to those with whom you are dealing,
  but \n"
- "it is degrading as regards your own actions.... We dare not turn from the principle
  that \n"
- |
  morality and not expediency is the thing that must guide us."
- |2+

- "The realists countered that however much Wilson had wanted to \"make the world
  \n"
- "safe for democracy,\" he had relied on the American army to achieve his ends. Wilson
  had \n"
- "fully recognized the historical implications of America's economic rise. But he
  \n"
- "wanted to help shape the peace at Versailles on the moral principles of democracy.
  After \n"
- "his return in 1919, he declared in Los Angeles: \"The day we have left behind us
  ... was a \n"
- "day of balances of power. It was a day of `every nation take care of itself or
  make a \n"
- "partnership with some other nation or group of nations to hold the peace of the
  world \n"
- "steady or to dominate the weaker portions of the world.' Those were the days of
  \n"
- "alliances. This project of the League of Nations is a great process of disentanglement.\"
  \n"
- "The league was supposed to be a democratic organization of the world's nations,
  \n"
- |
  America's contribution to a general world order.
- |2+

- "Congress, however, rejected the Treaty of Versailles. When Sen. Henry Cabot \n"
- "Lodge introduced a series of reservations restricting the league's jurisdiction,
  Wilson, \n"
- "fearing the destruction of the democratic intent of the league, refused to accept
  them. In \n"
- "the end, the moral example of democratic aspiration in isolation at home failed
  to \n"
- "reconcile foreign nationalistic demands voiced around the world. The league, which
  had \n"
- "no other power than that of its member states, was helpless to prevent Japanese
  \n"
- "expansion in Manchuria and China, Italy's conquest of Ethiopia, and Hitler's repudiation
  \n"
- |
  of the Versailles settlement.
- |2+

- "These crises threw American thought about the world in turmoil, and World War II
  \n"
- "gave impetus to the intellectual tradition of the realists. After the war Morgenthau's
  \n"
- "Politics among Nations became probably the most influential textbook of its time,
  read \n"
- "by specialists and students for the framework it offered in the field of world
  affairs. By \n"
- "mid-century the preoccupation with power politics and the struggle for political
  and \n"
- "military power had largely replaced the economic doctrines that Lenin and Charles
  Beard \n"
- |
  had expounded as the basis of world affairs in earlier days.
- |2+

- "Realism entered the plane of government and diplomacy. Influential among the \n"
- "realists who applied theory to policy was George Kennan, a student of history,
  \n"
- "diplomat, policy analyst, and expert on Soviet affairs. Kennan believed that the
  most \n"
- "serious fault of American policy was what he called the \"legalistic-moralistic
  approach to \n"
- "international problems.\" That approach he labeled idealistic, for it projected
  the common \n"
- "concepts of American law and politics into international relations--as in the Hague
  \n"
- "conferences on disarmament, the Kellogg Pact to make war illegal, and the League
  of \n"
- "Nations. Remarkably, Kennan asserted that realism would free foreign affairs from
  \n"
- "concepts of right and wrong, and correct the \"assumption that state behavior is
  a fit \n"
- "subject for moral judgment.... It is a curious thing, but it is true, that the
  legalistic \n"
- "approach to world affairs, rooted as it unquestionably is in a desire to do away
  with war \n"
- "and violence, makes violence more enduring, more terrible, and more destructive
  to \n"
- "political stability than did the older motives of national interest.\" Kennan pleaded
  in the \n"
- "early 1950s for the realism of power politics--or, as he wrote, for whatever \"is
  realistic \n"
- "in concept, and founded in an endeavor to see both ourselves and others as we really
  \n"
- "are.\" In his cabled dispatches from Moscow to the State Department, Kennan \n"
- "urged--as strongly as in his later writings, including Realities of American Foreign
  \n"
- "Policy--that relations with Russia be placed entirely on a \"realistic and \n"
- "matter-of-fact basis,\" guided not by morality or altruism, but by the strengths
  and \n"
- |
  weaknesses of nations.
- |2+

- "The nation's rise in the world, from the perspective of the realists, rested on
  power \n"
- "and its elements, which included geography, natural resources, population, industrial
  \n"
- "development, military ability, and national morale. The balance of power enabled
  the \n"
- "United States in the mid-twentieth century to pursue interests in remote regions
  of the \n"
- "earth through trade, cultural activity, and war. Opposed as it was to moralism,
  realism \n"
- "nevertheless reflected not merely a concern for fact or reality but also a regard
  for \n"
- "elemental power as force and influence. Realism was a way of looking at the world,
  \n"
- "comprehended as power politics. For our purposes, power is defined as the qualities
  or \n"
- "properties that make possible the national exertion of influence or force in the
  world. \n"
- "Power, in this sense, means essentially capability rather than actual force or
  influence, \n"
- "though we may find that the ways influence was exerted might indeed eventually
  \n"
- |
  enhance or weaken the power that supported it.
- |2+

- "Our attempt to understand the origins of America's world role turns now to the
  \n"
- "themes of the elements and balance of power. We will first examine the various
  reasons \n"
- "for the balance of power that contemporaries set forth according to their rational
  beliefs \n"
- "about the world. Our work, as the study progresses, is to analyze these explanations
  \n"
- |
  and to weigh them for significance against the world with which contemporaries dealt.

- "At mid-twentieth century, when the second great world war \n"
- "ended, the United States enjoyed wealth and prosperity \n"
- "unknown in foreign lands and rose to a summit of power. \n"
- "The interests and influence of Americans extended far from \n"
- "home. Their commerce was carried by merchant ships and \n"
- "aircraft to distant cities. The dollar was the standard of \n"
- "international finance and the credits of American banks \n"
- "flowed everywhere. Food, clothing, movies, machines, and \n"
- "science made the American name known throughout the \n"
- "world. The people shared their fortune by distributing \n"
- "charitable aid abroad in quantities without precedent. As \n"
- "after earlier wars in their history, their citizen-soldiers were \n"
- "disbanded and sent home. Yet the government pledged to \n"
- "defend friendly states and kept units of its undefeated army \n"
- "in strategic outposts, sea power that patrolled the oceans, \n"
- "and an air force that guarded the sky. It was a time of general \n"
- "peace and faraway local conflicts; no third world war \n"
- "erupted. The United States kept an order favorable to its \n"
- "allies and demonstrated its art of trade and ways of culture \n"
- |
  and modern living to aged societies.
- |2+

- "The frontiers of American interest that came to gird the \n"
- "world began with the first colonial settlements huddled along \n"
- "the Atlantic coast. At independence in 1783, the United \n"
- "States took possession of forest and lake lands westward to \n"
- "the Mississippi River. In 1803 it expanded across the Great \n"
- "Plains of the Louisiana Territory as far as the Rocky \n"
- "Mountains. In 1819 it gained the Florida peninsula. The \n"
- "flatlands of Texas were incorporated into the Union in 1846, \n"
- "as were the forests of Oregon. At the conclusion of the war \n"
- "with Mexico in 1848, the United States won the \n"
- "southwestern desert regions, the Rocky Mountains, and the \n"
- "western coastal slopes all the way to the Pacific Ocean, \n"
- "leaving only minor adjustments, such as the wedge-shaped \n"
- "Gadsden Purchase in the Southwest, to fill out its linear \n"
- |
  boundaries.
- |2+

- "Through treaties, commitments, and unilateral \n"
- "declarations, the United States made allies with far-flung \n"
- "countries in areas where the interests of American trade, \n"
- "philanthropy, culture, and security were often greater than \n"
- "those of any other power, and the boundaries of some \n"
- "distant lands became the frontiers of these interests. These \n"
- "foreign affiliations first covered the Western Hemisphere. \n"
- |
  As early as 1823 President James Monroe proclaimed influence
- "over both North and South America by opposing European control or meddling. \n"
- "Here the frontiers stood, for the most part, until around the end of the nineteenth
  \n"
- "century, when in a burst of expansive energy the United States consolidated its
  \n"
- "hemispheric interests by taking colonies in the West Indies: Puerto Rico, occupied
  by \n"
- "troops in the Spanish-American War in 1898, and the Virgin Islands, purchased from
  \n"
- "Denmark in World War I. The Panama Canal Zone came under the jurisdiction of the
  \n"
- "United States in 1903. To the west the United States extended its possessions deep
  into \n"
- "the Pacific Ocean, from Alaska, owned since 1867, to the Hawaiian islands and the
  \n"
- "Philippines in 1898. To connect the American mainland with the Far East, the United
  \n"
- |
  States quickly gained as outposts the islands of Guam and Samoa.
- |2+

- "At the turn of the century, the area Americans had committed themselves to defend
  \n"
- "covered the Western Hemisphere and far beyond: on the Atlantic side, from Greenland
  to \n"
- "Brazil to Tierra del Fuego at the southern tip of South America; and on the Pacific
  side, \n"
- "across the world's largest ocean from Alaska to the Philippines. This area of security,
  \n"
- "Walter Lippmann calculated in 1943, comprised nearly 40 percent of the land surface
  of \n"
- |
  the earth. There it remained until World War II.
- |2+

- "The outer reach of American interest grew into distant zones once dominated by
  the \n"
- "empires of the Old World. The frontiers were never precisely defined, though they
  could \n"
- "be seen in the country's overseas wars and the visible remnants of its military
  bases, \n"
- "airstrips, and patrol roads. Other evidence of the frontiers was invisible: trade,
  cultural \n"
- "diffusion, and diplomatic commitments. After World War I, American interest in
  Britain, \n"
- "France, and Germany dwelled more on the export of products and investment than
  on \n"
- "political order or military force. Early in World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt
  \n"
- "denied reports that he had said the American frontier ran along the Rhine River.
  But he \n"
- "made no secret of his belief that American interests lay along the German border,
  for he \n"
- "feared that if the lands adjacent to the Rhine, which flowed through the industrial
  heart \n"
- "of Western Europe, came under the domination of a hostile totalitarian power, American
  \n"
- "trade and security would be weakened. The Western Hemisphere would be a besieged
  \n"
- |
  island.
- |2+

- "After victory in the European war, the United States quickly established \n"
- "occupation bases in Germany, and its frontier of interest penetrated deep into
  Europe. In \n"
- "March 1946, former Prime Minister Winston Churchill, accompanied by President \n"
- "Harry Truman, delivered a speech at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, that
  \n"
- "defined the new area within which the United States was obliged to assert its power.
  \n"
- "This area came up against regions held by Soviet Russia, which had brought down
  a \n"
- "communist \"iron curtain\" running from the Baltic Sea across the Eurasian plain
  to the \n"
- |
  Adriatic.
- |2+

- "A year later Truman in effect extended this frontier of interest from the Adriatic
  \n"
- "across the Balkan peninsula, beyond the straits of the Dardanelles linking Europe
  with \n"
- "Asia, nearly to the edge of the Caucasus Mountains. American financial grants \n"
- "supported the borderlands of Greece and Turkey, and credits and aid flowed throughout
  \n"
- "Western Europe, even to the British Empire, so recently the major world power.
  In the \n"
- "Atlantic, where Europeans had once dominated exploration and trade, the American
  \n"
- |
  merchant marine and navy had become triumphant.
- |2+

- "In the Pacific, a defensive perimeter drawn up in January 1950 by Secretary of
  \n"
- "State Dean Acheson established a line of security running from near the tip of
  Alaska, \n"
- "southwest along the Aleutian Islands, across the sea to the islands of Japan, along
  the \n"
- "chain of the Ryukyu Islands, the largest of which was Okinawa, to the Philippines.
  The \n"
- "commitments to the East were at first not so strong, nor so well defined, as those
  to \n"
- "Europe. As an ally in the war against Japan, China had received American backing
  until \n"
- "its 1949 revolution made it a communist cohort of the Soviet Union. China then
  fell \n"
- "from favor, while the former enemy, Japan, under occupation for years by the \n"
- "American army, became a friend. Taiwan was not included behind this original \n"
- "perimeter, and it was uncertain for a time whether the lower part of Korea, south
  of \n"
- "China, was behind the line or a no-man's-land. But within the year of Acheson's
  \n"
- "expansion of the frontiers of American protection, the line fell across Korea,
  and \n"
- "American forces rushed to defend a front in the south against communist Koreans
  \n"
- "invading from the north. Far to the south lay the island continent of Australia,
  which, \n"
- |
  despite its distance, maintained close ties with America.
- |2+

- "These frontiers of influence were strengthened with the formation of a military
  \n"
- "alliance system in Western Europe in 1949 and in eastern Asia in the early 1950s.
  But \n"
- "the frontiers on opposite sides of the world did not yet connect. To complete the
  \n"
- "circle, the United States gained allies in the 1950s among the nations of southern
  Asia, \n"
- "where political frontiers or perimeters were intermittently broken or lacked firmness.
  \n"
- "The line of influence extended through Southeast Asia, including South Vietnam,
  Laos, \n"
- "and Cambodia. It continued along the northern boundaries of divided Pakistan, Iran,
  \n"
- "and Turkey, though India and Burma declared neutrality after gaining independence
  \n"
- "from Great Britain. The frontier was buttressed by rugged natural barriers that
  ran the \n"
- "length of the Himalaya range from the Khyber Pass, past the gates of India, to
  the \n"
- "southern shores of the Caspian Sea, around the great deserts above the Persian
  Gulf, \n"
- |
  to, once again, the Caucasus, the Dardanelles, and Europe.
- |2+

- "Such was the state of the frontiers of American interest as they developed from
  \n"
- "World War II into the 1950s. They were not the borders of an empire that held \n"
- "territory under a single sovereign authority. The United States was a republic
  and its \n"
- "principal means of establishing influence were aid, commerce, and diplomacy, though
  it \n"
- "came to offer protection against belligerents. It assumed the role of a primary
  power \n"
- "for which no other could substitute. Along the frontiers of this defensive area,
  the \n"
- "Americans confronted a revolutionary and mighty adversary, the Russians, and their
  \n"
- |
  massive nation with adjacent satellites.
- |2+

- "To the allied states along this frontier, the promise of American aid and defense
  \n"
- "reached, and from those lands this influence was never to retreat under coercion
  of \n"
- "aggressors. On the European frontier the American pledge had no foreseeable end:
  \n"
- "\"continuous,\" declared the treaty that united under American protection the Western
  \n"
- "European empires of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Denmark. In
  the \n"
- "Pacific, to the Philippines, and later to Australia and New Zealand, the American
  \n"
- "commitments would remain in force \"indefinitely.\" As for Japan, no change in
  its \n"
- "deference to the United States for its defense or to America's exclusive right
  to bases \n"
- "could take place without American consultation. In Southeast Asia, too, the Americans
  \n"
- "promised not to yield, and again the term \"indefinitely\" applied. American treaties
  were \n"
- "open to review by sovereign nations, but those commitments implied, no less than
  \n"
- "respect for the sovereignty of the allies, that the Americans intended never to
  surrender a \n"
- "foot of territory to aggressor nations. The Americans had never lost a war; the
  United \n"
- "States would not retreat. Where the strategic frontier lay at its farthest extent,
  in \n"
- "Southeast Asia, President Dwight Eisenhower compared the borderland to \"a leaky
  dike, \n"
- "and with leaky dikes it's sometimes better to put a finger in than to let the whole
  \n"
- |
  structure be washed away."
- |2+

- "It is these dimensions of space and time that provide a context in which the trade,
  \n"
- "cultural exchange, and battles fought in defense of American influence took place.
  Let us \n"
- "now continue not by reciting these events but rather by seeking to explain how
  and why \n"
- "a seaboard nation swelled into a world state. What are the origins of America's
  world \n"
- |
  role?
- |2+

- |2+

- "Americans at midcentury dealt with the glories and problems of power as the people
  of \n"
- "every preceding age had done, but their global power was distinguished by its magnitude.
  \n"
- "As World War II was drawing to a close, in late 1944 President Roosevelt reflected,
  \"At \n"
- "the end of this war this country will have the greatest material power of any Nation
  in \n"
- "the world. It will be a clean, shining America.\" He attributed America's rise
  to an \n"
- "expanding economy of peaceful production, richer than any other in skilled workers,
  and \n"
- |
  advanced in engineering, farming, business, and technological knowhow.
- |2+

- "Government officials envisioned the same exceptional rise to power. Explanations
  \n"
- "of it varied, however. Harry Hopkins, an intimate adviser to the president, agreed.
  \"We \n"
- "will emerge from this war the richest and most powerful people in the world.\"
  The \n"
- "United States alone, of all the great powers, would possess lands unscarred, a
  people \n"
- "well nourished, and a breadbasket filled to overflowing. \"We will have the largest
  navy \n"
- "and merchant fleet on the seven seas, more airplanes than any other nation. Already
  a \n"
- "technological people before the war, we will find ourselves, as the result of our
  work in \n"
- "munitions factories, with the largest army of skilled workers in history. Our industrial
  \n"
- "production capacity, vaster than the combined capacity of our Allies, will be sufficient,
  \n"
- "once converted to the uses of peace, to fill consumer needs at home and, at the
  same \n"
- "time, to supply ... heavy goods ... for rehabilitation abroad. Our raw materials
  and \n"
- "natural resources ... will be sufficient, with wise stewardship, to last for generations.
  \n"
- "But, above all, we will emerge with our democratic institutions intact, a people
  free to \n"
- |
  shape our destiny as we see fit."
- |2+

- "Soon after succeeding to the presidency, Truman made an even more ambitious \n"
- "claim for America's rise. \"We tell ourselves that we have emerged from this war,\"
  he \n"
- "remarked in a radio address in August 1945, \"the most powerful nation in the \n"
- "world--the most powerful nation, perhaps, in all history. That is true, but not
  in the \n"
- "sense some of us believe it to be true.\" The war had shown Truman that the United
  \n"
- "States had tremendous material resources, skilled workers, managers, able generals,
  and \n"
- "a brave people capable of bearing arms. \"The new thing--the thing which we had
  not \n"
- "known--the thing we have learned now and should never forget, is this: that a society
  \n"
- "of self-governing men is more powerful, more enduring, more creative than any other
  \n"
- |
  kind of society, however disciplined, however centralized."
- |2+

- "Campaigning for the presidency in his own right in 1948, Truman barnstormed the
  \n"
- "country to convey to citizens the world-changing importance of their power. He
  \n"
- "hammered away at this theme from the back platform of the presidential train and
  in \n"
- |
  big-city convention halls and stadiums:
- |2+

- |
  Trenton, Missouri, September 18: "this country will continue for another
- |
  thousand years as the greatest country in the world."
- |2+

- |
  Dayton, Ohio, October 11: "Now, this great Republic--the greatest in history,
- |
  the greatest that the sun has ever shone upon--is charged with leadership in the
- |
  world for the welfare of the whole world as well as our own welfare."
- "Not only political leaders but also editors, columnists, and writers proclaimed
  \n"
- "America's extraordinary rise. In early 1941 Henry Luce had decided to throw the
  \n"
- "weight of his publishing empire behind an effort to explain the emergence of the
  United \n"
- "States as a dominant power. Neil MacNeil, an editor of the New York Times, stating
  in \n"
- "1944 that for a time \"the United States must remain the most powerful of world
  \n"
- "powers,\" listed American assets in a particular order: the \"most powerful navy
  that has \n"
- "ever sailed the five oceans\"; the \"biggest and hardest hitting air force that
  the world \n"
- "has ever known\"; the greatest national industrial output on earth; the largest
  merchant \n"
- "marine at sea; the largest number of transport and commercial airplanes in the
  sky; an \n"
- "agricultural plant capable of feeding Americans and contributing more than any
  other to \n"
- "feeding hungry peoples; the \"greatest national production of steel, petroleum,
  cotton \n"
- "and other vital products\"; a domain located in the Western Hemisphere; and vast
  \n"
- "holdings of monetary gold and silver. Writing in Reader's Digest, Harry Scherman,
  a \n"
- |
  popular journalist, called America simply "the most powerful nation in history."
- |2+

- "Government policy analysts examined in secret the status of national power. \n"
- "Following a request in 1948 by Secretary of Defense James Forrestal for a study
  of \"the \n"
- "proportion of our resources which should be devoted to military purposes,\" the
  National \n"
- "Security Council produced a series of reports. The most comprehensive consideration
  of \n"
- "America's possession of \"superior overall power,\" the document numbered NSC 68,
  \n"
- "which Truman approved in 1950, cited as vital components \"a unique degree of unity\"
  in \n"
- "society, \"the capability of the American economy,\" and \"military strength,\"
  including \n"
- "atomic armaments. The NSC subsequently sent a report to President Eisenhower, \n"
- "advising again that the American position as the \"leader of the free world\" was
  sustained \n"
- "by a \"strong military posture,\" a \"sound, strong and growing economy,\" and
  a high \n"
- "\"morale and free institutions,\" to which were added \"sufficient atomic weapons
  and \n"
- "effective means of delivery.\" The implication of the national security papers,
  even those \n"
- "of different administrations, was that to maintain superiority over the Soviet
  Union, the \n"
- |
  United States had to develop its assets to their maximum potential.
- |2+

- "These ideas were not entirely new. Leaders had been assessing America's rise in
  the \n"
- "world from the beginning of the Republic. In 1780 John Adams told the French foreign
  \n"
- "minister, comte de Vergennes, that the \"United States of America are a great and
  \n"
- "powerful people, whatever European statesmen may think of them.\" The country,
  \n"
- "Adams asserted, had unbounded possibilities for the future because of its enormous
  \n"
- "territorial expanse, embracing rich soil, mild climate, and incalculably plentiful
  natural \n"
- "resources, and because of the American people, rapidly expanding in numbers, and
  their \n"
- |
  production of agricultural goods for trade abroad.
- |2+

- "Yet only in the late nineteenth century did the nation become widely recognized
  as a \n"
- "world power. William McKinley was the first modern president to claim that American
  \n"
- "power was the greatest in the world. In 1892, before assuming office, he quoted
  from an \n"
- "article written fourteen years earlier by the British statesman William Gladstone
  in the \n"
- "North American Review. England and America, Gladstone said, were then \"the two
  \n"
- "strongest nations in the world, but there can hardly be a doubt as between the
  America \n"
- "and the England of the future that the daughter, at some no very distant time,
  whether \n"
- "fairer or less fair, will be unquestionably yet stronger than the mother.\" To
  McKinley \n"
- "that \"no very distant time\" suddenly arrived in the early 1890s. \"America,\"
  he said, \n"
- "\"`whether fairer or less fair'--certainly freer--is now `stronger than the mother.'\"
  \n"
- "America had become the strongest nation in the world because \"her power lies in
  a free \n"
- "and intelligent and progressive people,\" as well as in a strong, expanding economy
  and in \n"
- "social well-being. The Spanish-American War, a quick triumph resulting in the \n"
- "acquisition of an overseas empire in the Caribbean and the Pacific, dramatically
  \n"
- |
  confirmed for McKinley America's rise to world-power status.
- |2+

- "Victory in World War I revealed the enormous strength and potential of the \n"
- "industrialized continental nation. At the close of the conflict, President Woodrow
  Wilson \n"
- "stated that the United States was \"a nation as powerful as any in the world,\"
  yet it alone \n"
- "had achieved \"the primacy of the world.\" If America joined the League of Nations,
  \n"
- "Wilson declared, the country would be \"partners\" with the other powers. But,
  he added, \n"
- "\"let me predict we will be the senior partner. The financial leadership will be
  ours. The \n"
- "industrial primacy will be ours. The commercial advantage will be ours. The other
  \n"
- "countries of the world are looking to us for leadership and direction.\" Through
  the \n"
- "\"growth of our power,\" Wilson said, \"we have become a determining factor in
  the \n"
- "history of mankind.\" Industry and capital continued to grow through the 1920s,
  and so \n"
- "did the nation's economic prowess. Advances in education, science, invention, \n"
- "efficiency, and production were among the factors that led Herbert Hoover to claim
  that \n"
- |
  America had attained a "position of transcendent power."
- |2+

- "The attributes contemporaries accorded to this progress in each period were largely
  \n"
- "unanalyzed. They made lists of divergent factors--material and psychological, human
  \n"
- "and technological, peaceful and military--but these lists did not adequately distinguish
  \n"
- "one item from another. Enumerations did not indicate what was a significant \n"
- "development and what was not. We seek some structure of thought and analysis in
  an \n"
- "effort to understand why the United States became capable of exercising world \n"
- |
  influence.
- |2+

- |2+

- "An extensive attempt to comprehend the rise and decline of nations came in a new
  \n"
- "school in international politics that emerged around the theory of power politics.
  \n"
- "Under the impetus of world war, political scientists and strategists developed
  this \n"
- "theory in the 1930s and made it popular in the 1940s, believing that it was the
  only \n"
- "realistic way to see the world; hence their common name, \"realists.\" They were
  direct \n"
- "about pursuing the national interest: a nation that abandoned self-preservation
  as the \n"
- |
  chief motive of its policy risked its very survival.
- |2+

- "One of the ablest of the early realists was Nicholas John Spykman, a political
  \n"
- "scientist at Yale, who stressed in 1942 that all civilized life rested \"in the
  last instance \n"
- "on power.\" Without power, he believed, no social progress was possible. Mechanical
  \n"
- "power--the ability to move mass--was the product of technology, and political \n"
- |
  power--the ability to move people--put technology at the service of society.
- |2+

- "Spykman was baffled as to why power had a \"bad name.\" He argued that \n"
- "Americans were wrong to condemn power as connoting evil, because power was only
  a \n"
- "means to an end. Sometimes the end was worthy, and in any case people were \n"
- "pursuing power with whole-hearted devotion. In ladies' sewing circles, he gathered,
  no \n"
- "less than in struggles between nations, power was a fact of life. A sound and practical
  \n"
- "foreign policy, Spykman stressed, should be designed \"in terms of the realities
  of \n"
- "international relations, in terms of power politics.\" Already supposed to be in
  \n"
- "possession of unquestioned hegemony over a large part of the New World, the United
  \n"
- "States, Spykman predicted, should be expected in the post-World War II era to \n"
- |
  exercise its power in all parts of the world in pursuit of its interests.
- |2+

- "A year before the close of the war, William T. R. Fox, a research associate at
  the \n"
- "Yale Institute of International Studies, gave currency to the idea of a new status
  to which \n"
- "squirrels and elephants. He was quick to explain that the Soviet Union and the
  \n"
- "Dominican Republic were not both elephants, nor were they both squirrels; and he
  \n"
- "wanted to make clear that \"we are not fighting to make them both squirrels.\"
  For Fox, the \n"
- "elephants mattered most in keeping the postwar peace. Differences in power would
  \n"
- "continue to exist among nations, he said, and the problems of the world would not
  be \n"
- "solved by endeavors to create a world of \"no-power politics.\" Fox, like Spykman,
  \n"
- "insisted that power itself was ethically neutral. He urged Americans to recognize
  that \n"
- "power was a basic feature of political life and that it made \"the most enormous
  difference \n"
- "in whose hands predominant power rests.\" After the war, he predicted, the United
  \n"
- "States would be rated as greater than a regional power restricted to a single area.
  As a \n"
- "superpower, it would have interests and influence from the East to the West. \"'Great
  \n"
- |
  power plus great mobility of power' describes the super-power," he claimed.
- |2+

- "The political scientist Hans J. Morgenthau did more than any other figure to \n"
- "establish the realist interpretation of international affairs. In 1948 he published
  his \n"
- "classic treatise Politics among Nations: The Struggle for Power and Peace, which
  argued \n"
- "that struggle for power was the essence of international affairs. Born in Germany
  in \n"
- "1904, Morgenthau fled to Switzerland to escape Hitler and in 1937 emigrated to
  the \n"
- "United States, where he found the study of international affairs disorganized.
  While \n"
- "teaching at Brooklyn College, later at the University of Kansas and, beginning
  in \n"
- "1943--the year he became a citizen--at the University of Chicago, he criticized
  the \n"
- "writing in his field by historians and international lawyers as overly legalistic
  and \n"
- "idealistic. Morgenthau brought from the Old World a pessimism about man's nature
  and \n"
- "the state of the world, while his scholarly work led him to believe that objective
  truths \n"
- "about politics could be discovered by human reason. His wealth of knowledge enabled
  \n"
- "him to lecture to his classes on world politics without a text; one of his students
  took a \n"
- |
  stenographic transcript of what he said, which became the draft of his book.
- |2+

- "Morgenthau directly related his power theories to the observation that \"the United
  \n"
- "States is at the moment of this writing the most powerful nation on earth.\" He
  was \n"
- "intrigued with the problems and rivalries this power created. \"International politics,\"
  he \n"
- "wrote, \"like all politics, is a struggle for power.\" Power was more than brutal
  force, it \n"
- "was the central aim of national interest. He proposed that the pursuit of power
  was the \n"
- "source of state behavior. No matter what the ultimate aims of nations, whether
  freedom, \n"
- "security, or prosperity, their immediate goal was power. Power was the means to
  \n"
- "national ends. Political power meant \"man's control over the minds and actions
  of other \n"
- "men.\" It followed that power was also \"a psychological relationship between those
  who \n"
- "exercise it and those over whom it is exercised,\" enabling some people to control
  the \n"
- "actions of others through orders, threats, persuasion, or a combination of these.
  Since he \n"
- "had traced the struggle for power back through history, he believed the contest
  for power \n"
- |
  must be ever-present.
- |2+

- "Morgenthau, impatient with moral sentiment or wishful idealism, believed that the
  \n"
- "pursuit of power was not necessarily immoral. \"To act successfully,\" he wrote
  in \n"
- "Scientific Man vs. Power Politics in 1946,\" ... is political wisdom. To know with
  \n"
- "despair that the political act is inevitably evil, and to act nevertheless, is
  moral courage. \n"
- "To choose among several expedient actions the least evil one is moral judgment.
  In the \n"
- "combination of political wisdom, moral courage, and moral judgment, man reconciles
  his \n"
- |
  political nature with his moral destiny."
- |2+

- "The chief opponents of the realists were the humanitarian moralists who saw the
  \n"
- "world from a different, ethical perspective. Of a longstanding tradition in the
  nineteenth \n"
- "century, the moralists included philosophers and writers who attributed America's
  rising \n"
- "world influence not to external force but to the internal example of a society.
  They \n"
- "opposed the power politics and imperialism of Europe. One of the early, clearsighted
  \n"
- "moralists was Albert Gallatin, who wrote \"The Mission of the United States\" at
  the \n"
- "time of the Mexican War. \"Your mission was, to be a model for all other governments\"
  \n"
- "and \"to apply all your faculties to the gradual improvement of your own institutions\"
  \n"
- "and, \"by your example, to exert a moral influence most beneficial to mankind at
  large. \n"
- "Instead of this, an appeal has been made to your worst passions; to cupidity, to
  the \n"
- "thirst of unjust aggrandizement by brutal force; to the love of military fame and
  of false \n"
- "glory.\" Aware that the world powers of the past had been empires and monarchies,
  the \n"
- "moralists argued that the United States should not act imperially in emulation
  of them \n"
- "but rather show the way to reform by exhibiting the success of its democratic society.
  \n"
- "Morgenthau pointed to John C. Calhoun and William Graham Sumner as worthy \n"
- "representatives of this world perspective, the latter writing during the \n"
- "Spanish-American War that \"expansionism and imperialism are at war with the best
  \n"
- |
  traditions, principles, and interests of the American people."
- |2+

- "The realists responded that in the past the moralists could afford to advocate
  that \n"
- "their nation be small and inconsequential but virtuous. After all, they had lived
  on a \n"
- "continent insulated from the outside. But their legacy threatened to damage the
  national \n"
- "interest, which required growing world involvement. Even when leaders made decisions
  \n"
- "for \"realistic\" actions, the realists contended, they had been perverted by irrelevant
  \n"
- "moralistic justifications. A case in point was President McKinley's defense of
  colonizing \n"
- "the Philippines: after prayer in the wee hours of the morning, he revealed, he
  had heard \n"
- |
  the voice of God tell him to annex the islands.
- |2+

- "Of all the spokesmen of the moralistic point of view, Woodrow Wilson was the \n"
- "most eloquent and his thought the most far-reaching. His conviction, well founded
  in \n"
- "nineteenth-century liberal thought and the ethical standards of Christian and Calvinistic
  \n"
- "theology, was that democracy and constitutional government would temper the \n"
- "maneuvers of the big powers. \"It is a very perilous thing,\" he said in an address
  in \n"
- "Mobile, Alabama, in October 1913, \"to determine the foreign policy of a nation
  in the \n"
- "terms of material interest. It not only is unfair to those with whom you are dealing,
  but \n"
- "it is degrading as regards your own actions.... We dare not turn from the principle
  that \n"
- |
  morality and not expediency is the thing that must guide us."
- |2+

- "The realists countered that however much Wilson had wanted to \"make the world
  \n"
- "safe for democracy,\" he had relied on the American army to achieve his ends. Wilson
  had \n"
- "fully recognized the historical implications of America's economic rise. But he
  \n"
- "wanted to help shape the peace at Versailles on the moral principles of democracy.
  After \n"
- "his return in 1919, he declared in Los Angeles: \"The day we have left behind us
  ... was a \n"
- "day of balances of power. It was a day of `every nation take care of itself or
  make a \n"
- "partnership with some other nation or group of nations to hold the peace of the
  world \n"
- "steady or to dominate the weaker portions of the world.' Those were the days of
  \n"
- "alliances. This project of the League of Nations is a great process of disentanglement.\"
  \n"
- "The league was supposed to be a democratic organization of the world's nations,
  \n"
- |
  America's contribution to a general world order.
- |2+

- "Congress, however, rejected the Treaty of Versailles. When Sen. Henry Cabot \n"
- "Lodge introduced a series of reservations restricting the league's jurisdiction,
  Wilson, \n"
- "fearing the destruction of the democratic intent of the league, refused to accept
  them. In \n"
- "the end, the moral example of democratic aspiration in isolation at home failed
  to \n"
- "reconcile foreign nationalistic demands voiced around the world. The league, which
  had \n"
- "no other power than that of its member states, was helpless to prevent Japanese
  \n"
- "expansion in Manchuria and China, Italy's conquest of Ethiopia, and Hitler's repudiation
  \n"
- |
  of the Versailles settlement.
- |2+

- "These crises threw American thought about the world in turmoil, and World War II
  \n"
- "gave impetus to the intellectual tradition of the realists. After the war Morgenthau's
  \n"
- "Politics among Nations became probably the most influential textbook of its time,
  read \n"
- "by specialists and students for the framework it offered in the field of world
  affairs. By \n"
- "mid-century the preoccupation with power politics and the struggle for political
  and \n"
- "military power had largely replaced the economic doctrines that Lenin and Charles
  Beard \n"
- |
  had expounded as the basis of world affairs in earlier days.
- |2+

- "Realism entered the plane of government and diplomacy. Influential among the \n"
- "realists who applied theory to policy was George Kennan, a student of history,
  \n"
- "diplomat, policy analyst, and expert on Soviet affairs. Kennan believed that the
  most \n"
- "serious fault of American policy was what he called the \"legalistic-moralistic
  approach to \n"
- "international problems.\" That approach he labeled idealistic, for it projected
  the common \n"
- "concepts of American law and politics into international relations--as in the Hague
  \n"
- "conferences on disarmament, the Kellogg Pact to make war illegal, and the League
  of \n"
- "Nations. Remarkably, Kennan asserted that realism would free foreign affairs from
  \n"
- "concepts of right and wrong, and correct the \"assumption that state behavior is
  a fit \n"
- "subject for moral judgment.... It is a curious thing, but it is true, that the
  legalistic \n"
- "approach to world affairs, rooted as it unquestionably is in a desire to do away
  with war \n"
- "and violence, makes violence more enduring, more terrible, and more destructive
  to \n"
- "political stability than did the older motives of national interest.\" Kennan pleaded
  in the \n"
- "early 1950s for the realism of power politics--or, as he wrote, for whatever \"is
  realistic \n"
- "in concept, and founded in an endeavor to see both ourselves and others as we really
  \n"
- "are.\" In his cabled dispatches from Moscow to the State Department, Kennan \n"
- "urged--as strongly as in his later writings, including Realities of American Foreign
  \n"
- "Policy--that relations with Russia be placed entirely on a \"realistic and \n"
- "matter-of-fact basis,\" guided not by morality or altruism, but by the strengths
  and \n"
- |
  weaknesses of nations.
- |2+

- "The nation's rise in the world, from the perspective of the realists, rested on
  power \n"
- "and its elements, which included geography, natural resources, population, industrial
  \n"
- "development, military ability, and national morale. The balance of power enabled
  the \n"
- "United States in the mid-twentieth century to pursue interests in remote regions
  of the \n"
- "earth through trade, cultural activity, and war. Opposed as it was to moralism,
  realism \n"
- "nevertheless reflected not merely a concern for fact or reality but also a regard
  for \n"
- "elemental power as force and influence. Realism was a way of looking at the world,
  \n"
- "comprehended as power politics. For our purposes, power is defined as the qualities
  or \n"
- "properties that make possible the national exertion of influence or force in the
  world. \n"
- "Power, in this sense, means essentially capability rather than actual force or
  influence, \n"
- "though we may find that the ways influence was exerted might indeed eventually
  \n"
- |
  enhance or weaken the power that supported it.
- |2+

- "Our attempt to understand the origins of America's world role turns now to the
  \n"
- "themes of the elements and balance of power. We will first examine the various
  reasons \n"
- "for the balance of power that contemporaries set forth according to their rational
  beliefs \n"
- "about the world. Our work, as the study progresses, is to analyze these explanations
  \n"
- |
  and to weigh them for significance against the world with which contemporaries dealt.

rawText: "\n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n\nThe American Century\nThe Rise and Decline
  of the United States as a World Power\nBy DONALD W. WHITE\nYale University Press\n\nRead
  the Review\n\n\nThe Frontiers\n\nAt mid-twentieth century, when the second great
  world war \nended, the United States enjoyed wealth and prosperity \nunknown in
  foreign lands and rose to a summit of power. \nThe interests and influence of Americans
  extended far from \nhome. Their commerce was carried by merchant ships and \naircraft
  to distant cities. The dollar was the standard of \ninternational finance and the
  credits of American banks \nflowed everywhere. Food, clothing, movies, machines,
  and \nscience made the American name known throughout the \nworld. The people shared
  their fortune by distributing \ncharitable aid abroad in quantities without precedent.
  As \nafter earlier wars in their history, their citizen-soldiers were \ndisbanded
  and sent home. Yet the government pledged to \ndefend friendly states and kept units
  of its undefeated army \nin strategic outposts, sea power that patrolled the oceans,
  \nand an air force that guarded the sky. It was a time of general \npeace and faraway
  local conflicts; no third world war \nerupted. The United States kept an order favorable
  to its \nallies and demonstrated its art of trade and ways of culture \nand modern
  living to aged societies.\n\nThe frontiers of American interest that came to gird
  the \nworld began with the first colonial settlements huddled along \nthe Atlantic
  coast. At independence in 1783, the United \nStates took possession of forest and
  lake lands westward to \nthe Mississippi River. In 1803 it expanded across the Great
  \nPlains of the Louisiana Territory as far as the Rocky \nMountains. In 1819 it
  gained the Florida peninsula. The \nflatlands of Texas were incorporated into the
  Union in 1846, \nas were the forests of Oregon. At the conclusion of the war \nwith
  Mexico in 1848, the United States won the \nsouthwestern desert regions, the Rocky
  Mountains, and the \nwestern coastal slopes all the way to the Pacific Ocean, \nleaving
  only minor adjustments, such as the wedge-shaped \nGadsden Purchase in the Southwest,
  to fill out its linear \nboundaries.\n\nThrough treaties, commitments, and unilateral
  \ndeclarations, the United States made allies with far-flung \ncountries in areas
  where the interests of American trade, \nphilanthropy, culture, and security were
  often greater than \nthose of any other power, and the boundaries of some \ndistant
  lands became the frontiers of these interests. These \nforeign affiliations first
  covered the Western Hemisphere. \nAs early as 1823 President James Monroe proclaimed
  influence\nover both North and South America by opposing European control or meddling.
  \nHere the frontiers stood, for the most part, until around the end of the nineteenth
  \ncentury, when in a burst of expansive energy the United States consolidated its
  \nhemispheric interests by taking colonies in the West Indies: Puerto Rico, occupied
  by \ntroops in the Spanish-American War in 1898, and the Virgin Islands, purchased
  from \nDenmark in World War I. The Panama Canal Zone came under the jurisdiction
  of the \nUnited States in 1903. To the west the United States extended its possessions
  deep into \nthe Pacific Ocean, from Alaska, owned since 1867, to the Hawaiian islands
  and the \nPhilippines in 1898. To connect the American mainland with the Far East,
  the United \nStates quickly gained as outposts the islands of Guam and Samoa.\n\nAt
  the turn of the century, the area Americans had committed themselves to defend \ncovered
  the Western Hemisphere and far beyond: on the Atlantic side, from Greenland to \nBrazil
  to Tierra del Fuego at the southern tip of South America; and on the Pacific side,
  \nacross the world's largest ocean from Alaska to the Philippines. This area of
  security, \nWalter Lippmann calculated in 1943, comprised nearly 40 percent of the
  land surface of \nthe earth. There it remained until World War II.\n\nThe outer
  reach of American interest grew into distant zones once dominated by the \nempires
  of the Old World. The frontiers were never precisely defined, though they could
  \nbe seen in the country's overseas wars and the visible remnants of its military
  bases, \nairstrips, and patrol roads. Other evidence of the frontiers was invisible:
  trade, cultural \ndiffusion, and diplomatic commitments. After World War I, American
  interest in Britain, \nFrance, and Germany dwelled more on the export of products
  and investment than on \npolitical order or military force. Early in World War II,
  President Franklin Roosevelt \ndenied reports that he had said the American frontier
  ran along the Rhine River. But he \nmade no secret of his belief that American interests
  lay along the German border, for he \nfeared that if the lands adjacent to the Rhine,
  which flowed through the industrial heart \nof Western Europe, came under the domination
  of a hostile totalitarian power, American \ntrade and security would be weakened.
  The Western Hemisphere would be a besieged \nisland.\n\nAfter victory in the European
  war, the United States quickly established \noccupation bases in Germany, and its
  frontier of interest penetrated deep into Europe. In \nMarch 1946, former Prime
  Minister Winston Churchill, accompanied by President \nHarry Truman, delivered a
  speech at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, that \ndefined the new area within
  which the United States was obliged to assert its power. \nThis area came up against
  regions held by Soviet Russia, which had brought down a \ncommunist \"iron curtain\"
  running from the Baltic Sea across the Eurasian plain to the \nAdriatic.\n\nA year
  later Truman in effect extended this frontier of interest from the Adriatic \nacross
  the Balkan peninsula, beyond the straits of the Dardanelles linking Europe with
  \nAsia, nearly to the edge of the Caucasus Mountains. American financial grants
  \nsupported the borderlands of Greece and Turkey, and credits and aid flowed throughout
  \nWestern Europe, even to the British Empire, so recently the major world power.
  In the \nAtlantic, where Europeans had once dominated exploration and trade, the
  American \nmerchant marine and navy had become triumphant.\n\nIn the Pacific, a
  defensive perimeter drawn up in January 1950 by Secretary of \nState Dean Acheson
  established a line of security running from near the tip of Alaska, \nsouthwest
  along the Aleutian Islands, across the sea to the islands of Japan, along the \nchain
  of the Ryukyu Islands, the largest of which was Okinawa, to the Philippines. The
  \ncommitments to the East were at first not so strong, nor so well defined, as those
  to \nEurope. As an ally in the war against Japan, China had received American backing
  until \nits 1949 revolution made it a communist cohort of the Soviet Union. China
  then fell \nfrom favor, while the former enemy, Japan, under occupation for years
  by the \nAmerican army, became a friend. Taiwan was not included behind this original
  \nperimeter, and it was uncertain for a time whether the lower part of Korea, south
  of \nChina, was behind the line or a no-man's-land. But within the year of Acheson's
  \nexpansion of the frontiers of American protection, the line fell across Korea,
  and \nAmerican forces rushed to defend a front in the south against communist Koreans
  \ninvading from the north. Far to the south lay the island continent of Australia,
  which, \ndespite its distance, maintained close ties with America.\n\nThese frontiers
  of influence were strengthened with the formation of a military \nalliance system
  in Western Europe in 1949 and in eastern Asia in the early 1950s. But \nthe frontiers
  on opposite sides of the world did not yet connect. To complete the \ncircle, the
  United States gained allies in the 1950s among the nations of southern Asia, \nwhere
  political frontiers or perimeters were intermittently broken or lacked firmness.
  \nThe line of influence extended through Southeast Asia, including South Vietnam,
  Laos, \nand Cambodia. It continued along the northern boundaries of divided Pakistan,
  Iran, \nand Turkey, though India and Burma declared neutrality after gaining independence
  \nfrom Great Britain. The frontier was buttressed by rugged natural barriers that
  ran the \nlength of the Himalaya range from the Khyber Pass, past the gates of India,
  to the \nsouthern shores of the Caspian Sea, around the great deserts above the
  Persian Gulf, \nto, once again, the Caucasus, the Dardanelles, and Europe.\n\nSuch
  was the state of the frontiers of American interest as they developed from \nWorld
  War II into the 1950s. They were not the borders of an empire that held \nterritory
  under a single sovereign authority. The United States was a republic and its \nprincipal
  means of establishing influence were aid, commerce, and diplomacy, though it \ncame
  to offer protection against belligerents. It assumed the role of a primary power
  \nfor which no other could substitute. Along the frontiers of this defensive area,
  the \nAmericans confronted a revolutionary and mighty adversary, the Russians, and
  their \nmassive nation with adjacent satellites.\n\nTo the allied states along this
  frontier, the promise of American aid and defense \nreached, and from those lands
  this influence was never to retreat under coercion of \naggressors. On the European
  frontier the American pledge had no foreseeable end: \n\"continuous,\" declared
  the treaty that united under American protection the Western \nEuropean empires
  of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Denmark. In the \nPacific, to
  the Philippines, and later to Australia and New Zealand, the American \ncommitments
  would remain in force \"indefinitely.\" As for Japan, no change in its \ndeference
  to the United States for its defense or to America's exclusive right to bases \ncould
  take place without American consultation. In Southeast Asia, too, the Americans
  \npromised not to yield, and again the term \"indefinitely\" applied. American treaties
  were \nopen to review by sovereign nations, but those commitments implied, no less
  than \nrespect for the sovereignty of the allies, that the Americans intended never
  to surrender a \nfoot of territory to aggressor nations. The Americans had never
  lost a war; the United \nStates would not retreat. Where the strategic frontier
  lay at its farthest extent, in \nSoutheast Asia, President Dwight Eisenhower compared
  the borderland to \"a leaky dike, \nand with leaky dikes it's sometimes better to
  put a finger in than to let the whole \nstructure be washed away.\"\n\nIt is these
  dimensions of space and time that provide a context in which the trade, \ncultural
  exchange, and battles fought in defense of American influence took place. Let us
  \nnow continue not by reciting these events but rather by seeking to explain how
  and why \na seaboard nation swelled into a world state. What are the origins of
  America's world \nrole?\n\nThe Problem of the Rise to World Power\n\nAmericans at
  midcentury dealt with the glories and problems of power as the people of \nevery
  preceding age had done, but their global power was distinguished by its magnitude.
  \nAs World War II was drawing to a close, in late 1944 President Roosevelt reflected,
  \"At \nthe end of this war this country will have the greatest material power of
  any Nation in \nthe world. It will be a clean, shining America.\" He attributed
  America's rise to an \nexpanding economy of peaceful production, richer than any
  other in skilled workers, and \nadvanced in engineering, farming, business, and
  technological knowhow.\n\nGovernment officials envisioned the same exceptional rise
  to power. Explanations \nof it varied, however. Harry Hopkins, an intimate adviser
  to the president, agreed. \"We \nwill emerge from this war the richest and most
  powerful people in the world.\" The \nUnited States alone, of all the great powers,
  would possess lands unscarred, a people \nwell nourished, and a breadbasket filled
  to overflowing. \"We will have the largest navy \nand merchant fleet on the seven
  seas, more airplanes than any other nation. Already a \ntechnological people before
  the war, we will find ourselves, as the result of our work in \nmunitions factories,
  with the largest army of skilled workers in history. Our industrial \nproduction
  capacity, vaster than the combined capacity of our Allies, will be sufficient, \nonce
  converted to the uses of peace, to fill consumer needs at home and, at the same
  \ntime, to supply ... heavy goods ... for rehabilitation abroad. Our raw materials
  and \nnatural resources ... will be sufficient, with wise stewardship, to last for
  generations. \nBut, above all, we will emerge with our democratic institutions intact,
  a people free to \nshape our destiny as we see fit.\"\n\nSoon after succeeding to
  the presidency, Truman made an even more ambitious \nclaim for America's rise. \"We
  tell ourselves that we have emerged from this war,\" he \nremarked in a radio address
  in August 1945, \"the most powerful nation in the \nworld--the most powerful nation,
  perhaps, in all history. That is true, but not in the \nsense some of us believe
  it to be true.\" The war had shown Truman that the United \nStates had tremendous
  material resources, skilled workers, managers, able generals, and \na brave people
  capable of bearing arms. \"The new thing--the thing which we had not \nknown--the
  thing we have learned now and should never forget, is this: that a society \nof
  self-governing men is more powerful, more enduring, more creative than any other
  \nkind of society, however disciplined, however centralized.\"\n\nCampaigning for
  the presidency in his own right in 1948, Truman barnstormed the \ncountry to convey
  to citizens the world-changing importance of their power. He \nhammered away at
  this theme from the back platform of the presidential train and in \nbig-city convention
  halls and stadiums:\n\nSalem, Oregon, June 11: \"This is the greatest Nation on
  earth, I think. The\ngreatest Nation in history, let's put it that way. We have
  done things that no\nother nation in the history of the world has done.\"\n\nTrenton,
  Missouri, September 18: \"this country will continue for another\nthousand years
  as the greatest country in the world.\"\n\nDayton, Ohio, October 11: \"Now, this
  great Republic--the greatest in history,\nthe greatest that the sun has ever shone
  upon--is charged with leadership in the\nworld for the welfare of the whole world
  as well as our own welfare.\"\nNot only political leaders but also editors, columnists,
  and writers proclaimed \nAmerica's extraordinary rise. In early 1941 Henry Luce
  had decided to throw the \nweight of his publishing empire behind an effort to explain
  the emergence of the United \nStates as a dominant power. Neil MacNeil, an editor
  of the New York Times, stating in \n1944 that for a time \"the United States must
  remain the most powerful of world \npowers,\" listed American assets in a particular
  order: the \"most powerful navy that has \never sailed the five oceans\"; the \"biggest
  and hardest hitting air force that the world \nhas ever known\"; the greatest national
  industrial output on earth; the largest merchant \nmarine at sea; the largest number
  of transport and commercial airplanes in the sky; an \nagricultural plant capable
  of feeding Americans and contributing more than any other to \nfeeding hungry peoples;
  the \"greatest national production of steel, petroleum, cotton \nand other vital
  products\"; a domain located in the Western Hemisphere; and vast \nholdings of monetary
  gold and silver. Writing in Reader's Digest, Harry Scherman, a \npopular journalist,
  called America simply \"the most powerful nation in history.\"\n\nGovernment policy
  analysts examined in secret the status of national power. \nFollowing a request
  in 1948 by Secretary of Defense James Forrestal for a study of \"the \nproportion
  of our resources which should be devoted to military purposes,\" the National \nSecurity
  Council produced a series of reports. The most comprehensive consideration of \nAmerica's
  possession of \"superior overall power,\" the document numbered NSC 68, \nwhich
  Truman approved in 1950, cited as vital components \"a unique degree of unity\"
  in \nsociety, \"the capability of the American economy,\" and \"military strength,\"
  including \natomic armaments. The NSC subsequently sent a report to President Eisenhower,
  \nadvising again that the American position as the \"leader of the free world\"
  was sustained \nby a \"strong military posture,\" a \"sound, strong and growing
  economy,\" and a high \n\"morale and free institutions,\" to which were added \"sufficient
  atomic weapons and \neffective means of delivery.\" The implication of the national
  security papers, even those \nof different administrations, was that to maintain
  superiority over the Soviet Union, the \nUnited States had to develop its assets
  to their maximum potential.\n\nThese ideas were not entirely new. Leaders had been
  assessing America's rise in the \nworld from the beginning of the Republic. In 1780
  John Adams told the French foreign \nminister, comte de Vergennes, that the \"United
  States of America are a great and \npowerful people, whatever European statesmen
  may think of them.\" The country, \nAdams asserted, had unbounded possibilities
  for the future because of its enormous \nterritorial expanse, embracing rich soil,
  mild climate, and incalculably plentiful natural \nresources, and because of the
  American people, rapidly expanding in numbers, and their \nproduction of agricultural
  goods for trade abroad.\n\nYet only in the late nineteenth century did the nation
  become widely recognized as a \nworld power. William McKinley was the first modern
  president to claim that American \npower was the greatest in the world. In 1892,
  before assuming office, he quoted from an \narticle written fourteen years earlier
  by the British statesman William Gladstone in the \nNorth American Review. England
  and America, Gladstone said, were then \"the two \nstrongest nations in the world,
  but there can hardly be a doubt as between the America \nand the England of the
  future that the daughter, at some no very distant time, whether \nfairer or less
  fair, will be unquestionably yet stronger than the mother.\" To McKinley \nthat
  \"no very distant time\" suddenly arrived in the early 1890s. \"America,\" he said,
  \n\"`whether fairer or less fair'--certainly freer--is now `stronger than the mother.'\"
  \nAmerica had become the strongest nation in the world because \"her power lies
  in a free \nand intelligent and progressive people,\" as well as in a strong, expanding
  economy and in \nsocial well-being. The Spanish-American War, a quick triumph resulting
  in the \nacquisition of an overseas empire in the Caribbean and the Pacific, dramatically
  \nconfirmed for McKinley America's rise to world-power status.\n\nVictory in World
  War I revealed the enormous strength and potential of the \nindustrialized continental
  nation. At the close of the conflict, President Woodrow Wilson \nstated that the
  United States was \"a nation as powerful as any in the world,\" yet it alone \nhad
  achieved \"the primacy of the world.\" If America joined the League of Nations,
  \nWilson declared, the country would be \"partners\" with the other powers. But,
  he added, \n\"let me predict we will be the senior partner. The financial leadership
  will be ours. The \nindustrial primacy will be ours. The commercial advantage will
  be ours. The other \ncountries of the world are looking to us for leadership and
  direction.\" Through the \n\"growth of our power,\" Wilson said, \"we have become
  a determining factor in the \nhistory of mankind.\" Industry and capital continued
  to grow through the 1920s, and so \ndid the nation's economic prowess. Advances
  in education, science, invention, \nefficiency, and production were among the factors
  that led Herbert Hoover to claim that \nAmerica had attained a \"position of transcendent
  power.\"\n\nThe attributes contemporaries accorded to this progress in each period
  were largely \nunanalyzed. They made lists of divergent factors--material and psychological,
  human \nand technological, peaceful and military--but these lists did not adequately
  distinguish \none item from another. Enumerations did not indicate what was a significant
  \ndevelopment and what was not. We seek some structure of thought and analysis in
  an \neffort to understand why the United States became capable of exercising world
  \ninfluence.\n\nThe Analysis of Power\n\nAn extensive attempt to comprehend the
  rise and decline of nations came in a new \nschool in international politics that
  emerged around the theory of power politics. \nUnder the impetus of world war, political
  scientists and strategists developed this \ntheory in the 1930s and made it popular
  in the 1940s, believing that it was the only \nrealistic way to see the world; hence
  their common name, \"realists.\" They were direct \nabout pursuing the national
  interest: a nation that abandoned self-preservation as the \nchief motive of its
  policy risked its very survival.\n\nOne of the ablest of the early realists was
  Nicholas John Spykman, a political \nscientist at Yale, who stressed in 1942 that
  all civilized life rested \"in the last instance \non power.\" Without power, he
  believed, no social progress was possible. Mechanical \npower--the ability to move
  mass--was the product of technology, and political \npower--the ability to move
  people--put technology at the service of society.\n\nSpykman was baffled as to why
  power had a \"bad name.\" He argued that \nAmericans were wrong to condemn power
  as connoting evil, because power was only a \nmeans to an end. Sometimes the end
  was worthy, and in any case people were \npursuing power with whole-hearted devotion.
  In ladies' sewing circles, he gathered, no \nless than in struggles between nations,
  power was a fact of life. A sound and practical \nforeign policy, Spykman stressed,
  should be designed \"in terms of the realities of \ninternational relations, in
  terms of power politics.\" Already supposed to be in \npossession of unquestioned
  hegemony over a large part of the New World, the United \nStates, Spykman predicted,
  should be expected in the post-World War II era to \nexercise its power in all parts
  of the world in pursuit of its interests.\n\nA year before the close of the war,
  William T. R. Fox, a research associate at the \nYale Institute of International
  Studies, gave currency to the idea of a new status to which \nsquirrels and elephants.
  He was quick to explain that the Soviet Union and the \nDominican Republic were
  not both elephants, nor were they both squirrels; and he \nwanted to make clear
  that \"we are not fighting to make them both squirrels.\" For Fox, the \nelephants
  mattered most in keeping the postwar peace. Differences in power would \ncontinue
  to exist among nations, he said, and the problems of the world would not be \nsolved
  by endeavors to create a world of \"no-power politics.\" Fox, like Spykman, \ninsisted
  that power itself was ethically neutral. He urged Americans to recognize that \npower
  was a basic feature of political life and that it made \"the most enormous difference
  \nin whose hands predominant power rests.\" After the war, he predicted, the United
  \nStates would be rated as greater than a regional power restricted to a single
  area. As a \nsuperpower, it would have interests and influence from the East to
  the West. \"'Great \npower plus great mobility of power' describes the super-power,\"
  he claimed.\n\nThe political scientist Hans J. Morgenthau did more than any other
  figure to \nestablish the realist interpretation of international affairs. In 1948
  he published his \nclassic treatise Politics among Nations: The Struggle for Power
  and Peace, which argued \nthat struggle for power was the essence of international
  affairs. Born in Germany in \n1904, Morgenthau fled to Switzerland to escape Hitler
  and in 1937 emigrated to the \nUnited States, where he found the study of international
  affairs disorganized. While \nteaching at Brooklyn College, later at the University
  of Kansas and, beginning in \n1943--the year he became a citizen--at the University
  of Chicago, he criticized the \nwriting in his field by historians and international
  lawyers as overly legalistic and \nidealistic. Morgenthau brought from the Old World
  a pessimism about man's nature and \nthe state of the world, while his scholarly
  work led him to believe that objective truths \nabout politics could be discovered
  by human reason. His wealth of knowledge enabled \nhim to lecture to his classes
  on world politics without a text; one of his students took a \nstenographic transcript
  of what he said, which became the draft of his book.\n\nMorgenthau directly related
  his power theories to the observation that \"the United \nStates is at the moment
  of this writing the most powerful nation on earth.\" He was \nintrigued with the
  problems and rivalries this power created. \"International politics,\" he \nwrote,
  \"like all politics, is a struggle for power.\" Power was more than brutal force,
  it \nwas the central aim of national interest. He proposed that the pursuit of power
  was the \nsource of state behavior. No matter what the ultimate aims of nations,
  whether freedom, \nsecurity, or prosperity, their immediate goal was power. Power
  was the means to \nnational ends. Political power meant \"man's control over the
  minds and actions of other \nmen.\" It followed that power was also \"a psychological
  relationship between those who \nexercise it and those over whom it is exercised,\"
  enabling some people to control the \nactions of others through orders, threats,
  persuasion, or a combination of these. Since he \nhad traced the struggle for power
  back through history, he believed the contest for power \nmust be ever-present.\n\nMorgenthau,
  impatient with moral sentiment or wishful idealism, believed that the \npursuit
  of power was not necessarily immoral. \"To act successfully,\" he wrote in \nScientific
  Man vs. Power Politics in 1946,\" ... is political wisdom. To know with \ndespair
  that the political act is inevitably evil, and to act nevertheless, is moral courage.
  \nTo choose among several expedient actions the least evil one is moral judgment.
  In the \ncombination of political wisdom, moral courage, and moral judgment, man
  reconciles his \npolitical nature with his moral destiny.\"\n\nThe chief opponents
  of the realists were the humanitarian moralists who saw the \nworld from a different,
  ethical perspective. Of a longstanding tradition in the nineteenth \ncentury, the
  moralists included philosophers and writers who attributed America's rising \nworld
  influence not to external force but to the internal example of a society. They \nopposed
  the power politics and imperialism of Europe. One of the early, clearsighted \nmoralists
  was Albert Gallatin, who wrote \"The Mission of the United States\" at the \ntime
  of the Mexican War. \"Your mission was, to be a model for all other governments\"
  \nand \"to apply all your faculties to the gradual improvement of your own institutions\"
  \nand, \"by your example, to exert a moral influence most beneficial to mankind
  at large. \nInstead of this, an appeal has been made to your worst passions; to
  cupidity, to the \nthirst of unjust aggrandizement by brutal force; to the love
  of military fame and of false \nglory.\" Aware that the world powers of the past
  had been empires and monarchies, the \nmoralists argued that the United States should
  not act imperially in emulation of them \nbut rather show the way to reform by exhibiting
  the success of its democratic society. \nMorgenthau pointed to John C. Calhoun and
  William Graham Sumner as worthy \nrepresentatives of this world perspective, the
  latter writing during the \nSpanish-American War that \"expansionism and imperialism
  are at war with the best \ntraditions, principles, and interests of the American
  people.\"\n\nThe realists responded that in the past the moralists could afford
  to advocate that \ntheir nation be small and inconsequential but virtuous. After
  all, they had lived on a \ncontinent insulated from the outside. But their legacy
  threatened to damage the national \ninterest, which required growing world involvement.
  Even when leaders made decisions \nfor \"realistic\" actions, the realists contended,
  they had been perverted by irrelevant \nmoralistic justifications. A case in point
  was President McKinley's defense of colonizing \nthe Philippines: after prayer in
  the wee hours of the morning, he revealed, he had heard \nthe voice of God tell
  him to annex the islands.\n\nOf all the spokesmen of the moralistic point of view,
  Woodrow Wilson was the \nmost eloquent and his thought the most far-reaching. His
  conviction, well founded in \nnineteenth-century liberal thought and the ethical
  standards of Christian and Calvinistic \ntheology, was that democracy and constitutional
  government would temper the \nmaneuvers of the big powers. \"It is a very perilous
  thing,\" he said in an address in \nMobile, Alabama, in October 1913, \"to determine
  the foreign policy of a nation in the \nterms of material interest. It not only
  is unfair to those with whom you are dealing, but \nit is degrading as regards your
  own actions.... We dare not turn from the principle that \nmorality and not expediency
  is the thing that must guide us.\"\n\nThe realists countered that however much Wilson
  had wanted to \"make the world \nsafe for democracy,\" he had relied on the American
  army to achieve his ends. Wilson had \nfully recognized the historical implications
  of America's economic rise. But he \nwanted to help shape the peace at Versailles
  on the moral principles of democracy. After \nhis return in 1919, he declared in
  Los Angeles: \"The day we have left behind us ... was a \nday of balances of power.
  It was a day of `every nation take care of itself or make a \npartnership with some
  other nation or group of nations to hold the peace of the world \nsteady or to dominate
  the weaker portions of the world.' Those were the days of \nalliances. This project
  of the League of Nations is a great process of disentanglement.\" \nThe league was
  supposed to be a democratic organization of the world's nations, \nAmerica's contribution
  to a general world order.\n\nCongress, however, rejected the Treaty of Versailles.
  When Sen. Henry Cabot \nLodge introduced a series of reservations restricting the
  league's jurisdiction, Wilson, \nfearing the destruction of the democratic intent
  of the league, refused to accept them. In \nthe end, the moral example of democratic
  aspiration in isolation at home failed to \nreconcile foreign nationalistic demands
  voiced around the world. The league, which had \nno other power than that of its
  member states, was helpless to prevent Japanese \nexpansion in Manchuria and China,
  Italy's conquest of Ethiopia, and Hitler's repudiation \nof the Versailles settlement.\n\nThese
  crises threw American thought about the world in turmoil, and World War II \ngave
  impetus to the intellectual tradition of the realists. After the war Morgenthau's
  \nPolitics among Nations became probably the most influential textbook of its time,
  read \nby specialists and students for the framework it offered in the field of
  world affairs. By \nmid-century the preoccupation with power politics and the struggle
  for political and \nmilitary power had largely replaced the economic doctrines that
  Lenin and Charles Beard \nhad expounded as the basis of world affairs in earlier
  days.\n\nRealism entered the plane of government and diplomacy. Influential among
  the \nrealists who applied theory to policy was George Kennan, a student of history,
  \ndiplomat, policy analyst, and expert on Soviet affairs. Kennan believed that the
  most \nserious fault of American policy was what he called the \"legalistic-moralistic
  approach to \ninternational problems.\" That approach he labeled idealistic, for
  it projected the common \nconcepts of American law and politics into international
  relations--as in the Hague \nconferences on disarmament, the Kellogg Pact to make
  war illegal, and the League of \nNations. Remarkably, Kennan asserted that realism
  would free foreign affairs from \nconcepts of right and wrong, and correct the \"assumption
  that state behavior is a fit \nsubject for moral judgment.... It is a curious thing,
  but it is true, that the legalistic \napproach to world affairs, rooted as it unquestionably
  is in a desire to do away with war \nand violence, makes violence more enduring,
  more terrible, and more destructive to \npolitical stability than did the older
  motives of national interest.\" Kennan pleaded in the \nearly 1950s for the realism
  of power politics--or, as he wrote, for whatever \"is realistic \nin concept, and
  founded in an endeavor to see both ourselves and others as we really \nare.\" In
  his cabled dispatches from Moscow to the State Department, Kennan \nurged--as strongly
  as in his later writings, including Realities of American Foreign \nPolicy--that
  relations with Russia be placed entirely on a \"realistic and \nmatter-of-fact basis,\"
  guided not by morality or altruism, but by the strengths and \nweaknesses of nations.\n\nThe
  nation's rise in the world, from the perspective of the realists, rested on power
  \nand its elements, which included geography, natural resources, population, industrial
  \ndevelopment, military ability, and national morale. The balance of power enabled
  the \nUnited States in the mid-twentieth century to pursue interests in remote regions
  of the \nearth through trade, cultural activity, and war. Opposed as it was to moralism,
  realism \nnevertheless reflected not merely a concern for fact or reality but also
  a regard for \nelemental power as force and influence. Realism was a way of looking
  at the world, \ncomprehended as power politics. For our purposes, power is defined
  as the qualities or \nproperties that make possible the national exertion of influence
  or force in the world. \nPower, in this sense, means essentially capability rather
  than actual force or influence, \nthough we may find that the ways influence was
  exerted might indeed eventually \nenhance or weaken the power that supported it.\n\nOur
  attempt to understand the origins of America's world role turns now to the \nthemes
  of the elements and balance of power. We will first examine the various reasons
  \nfor the balance of power that contemporaries set forth according to their rational
  beliefs \nabout the world. Our work, as the study progresses, is to analyze these
  explanations \nand to weigh them for significance against the world with which contemporaries
  dealt.\n  (C) 1996  Donald W. White All rights reserved.  ISBN: 0-300-05721-0\n\n\n\n\nReturn

  York Today\nCopyright 1997 The New York Times Company\n\n\nThe American Century\nThe
  Rise and Decline of the United States as a World Power\nRead the Review\n\n\nAt
  mid-twentieth century, when the second great world war \nended, the United States
  enjoyed wealth and prosperity \nunknown in foreign lands and rose to a summit of
  power. \nThe interests and influence of Americans extended far from \nhome. Their
  commerce was carried by merchant ships and \naircraft to distant cities. The dollar
  was the standard of \ninternational finance and the credits of American banks \nflowed
  everywhere. Food, clothing, movies, machines, and \nscience made the American name
  known throughout the \nworld. The people shared their fortune by distributing \ncharitable
  aid abroad in quantities without precedent. As \nafter earlier wars in their history,
  their citizen-soldiers were \ndisbanded and sent home. Yet the government pledged
  to \ndefend friendly states and kept units of its undefeated army \nin strategic
  outposts, sea power that patrolled the oceans, \nand an air force that guarded the
  sky. It was a time of general \npeace and faraway local conflicts; no third world
  war \nerupted. The United States kept an order favorable to its \nallies and demonstrated
  its art of trade and ways of culture \nand modern living to aged societies.\n\nThe
  frontiers of American interest that came to gird the \nworld began with the first
  colonial settlements huddled along \nthe Atlantic coast. At independence in 1783,
  the United \nStates took possession of forest and lake lands westward to \nthe Mississippi
  River. In 1803 it expanded across the Great \nPlains of the Louisiana Territory
  as far as the Rocky \nMountains. In 1819 it gained the Florida peninsula. The \nflatlands
  of Texas were incorporated into the Union in 1846, \nas were the forests of Oregon.
  At the conclusion of the war \nwith Mexico in 1848, the United States won the \nsouthwestern
  desert regions, the Rocky Mountains, and the \nwestern coastal slopes all the way
  to the Pacific Ocean, \nleaving only minor adjustments, such as the wedge-shaped
  \nGadsden Purchase in the Southwest, to fill out its linear \nboundaries.\n\nThrough
  treaties, commitments, and unilateral \ndeclarations, the United States made allies
  with far-flung \ncountries in areas where the interests of American trade, \nphilanthropy,
  culture, and security were often greater than \nthose of any other power, and the
  boundaries of some \ndistant lands became the frontiers of these interests. These
  \nforeign affiliations first covered the Western Hemisphere. \nAs early as 1823
  President James Monroe proclaimed influence\nover both North and South America by
  opposing European control or meddling. \nHere the frontiers stood, for the most
  part, until around the end of the nineteenth \ncentury, when in a burst of expansive
  energy the United States consolidated its \nhemispheric interests by taking colonies
  in the West Indies: Puerto Rico, occupied by \ntroops in the Spanish-American War
  in 1898, and the Virgin Islands, purchased from \nDenmark in World War I. The Panama
  Canal Zone came under the jurisdiction of the \nUnited States in 1903. To the west
  the United States extended its possessions deep into \nthe Pacific Ocean, from Alaska,
  owned since 1867, to the Hawaiian islands and the \nPhilippines in 1898. To connect
  the American mainland with the Far East, the United \nStates quickly gained as outposts
  the islands of Guam and Samoa.\n\nAt the turn of the century, the area Americans
  had committed themselves to defend \ncovered the Western Hemisphere and far beyond:
  on the Atlantic side, from Greenland to \nBrazil to Tierra del Fuego at the southern
  tip of South America; and on the Pacific side, \nacross the world's largest ocean
  from Alaska to the Philippines. This area of security, \nWalter Lippmann calculated
  in 1943, comprised nearly 40 percent of the land surface of \nthe earth. There it
  remained until World War II.\n\nThe outer reach of American interest grew into distant
  zones once dominated by the \nempires of the Old World. The frontiers were never
  precisely defined, though they could \nbe seen in the country's overseas wars and
  the visible remnants of its military bases, \nairstrips, and patrol roads. Other
  evidence of the frontiers was invisible: trade, cultural \ndiffusion, and diplomatic
  commitments. After World War I, American interest in Britain, \nFrance, and Germany
  dwelled more on the export of products and investment than on \npolitical order
  or military force. Early in World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt \ndenied
  reports that he had said the American frontier ran along the Rhine River. But he
  \nmade no secret of his belief that American interests lay along the German border,
  for he \nfeared that if the lands adjacent to the Rhine, which flowed through the
  industrial heart \nof Western Europe, came under the domination of a hostile totalitarian
  power, American \ntrade and security would be weakened. The Western Hemisphere would
  be a besieged \nisland.\n\nAfter victory in the European war, the United States
  quickly established \noccupation bases in Germany, and its frontier of interest
  penetrated deep into Europe. In \nMarch 1946, former Prime Minister Winston Churchill,
  accompanied by President \nHarry Truman, delivered a speech at Westminster College
  in Fulton, Missouri, that \ndefined the new area within which the United States
  was obliged to assert its power. \nThis area came up against regions held by Soviet
  Russia, which had brought down a \ncommunist \"iron curtain\" running from the Baltic
  Sea across the Eurasian plain to the \nAdriatic.\n\nA year later Truman in effect
  extended this frontier of interest from the Adriatic \nacross the Balkan peninsula,
  beyond the straits of the Dardanelles linking Europe with \nAsia, nearly to the
  edge of the Caucasus Mountains. American financial grants \nsupported the borderlands
  of Greece and Turkey, and credits and aid flowed throughout \nWestern Europe, even
  to the British Empire, so recently the major world power. In the \nAtlantic, where
  Europeans had once dominated exploration and trade, the American \nmerchant marine
  and navy had become triumphant.\n\nIn the Pacific, a defensive perimeter drawn up
  in January 1950 by Secretary of \nState Dean Acheson established a line of security
  running from near the tip of Alaska, \nsouthwest along the Aleutian Islands, across
  the sea to the islands of Japan, along the \nchain of the Ryukyu Islands, the largest
  of which was Okinawa, to the Philippines. The \ncommitments to the East were at
  first not so strong, nor so well defined, as those to \nEurope. As an ally in the
  war against Japan, China had received American backing until \nits 1949 revolution
  made it a communist cohort of the Soviet Union. China then fell \nfrom favor, while
  the former enemy, Japan, under occupation for years by the \nAmerican army, became
  a friend. Taiwan was not included behind this original \nperimeter, and it was uncertain
  for a time whether the lower part of Korea, south of \nChina, was behind the line
  or a no-man's-land. But within the year of Acheson's \nexpansion of the frontiers
  of American protection, the line fell across Korea, and \nAmerican forces rushed
  to defend a front in the south against communist Koreans \ninvading from the north.
  Far to the south lay the island continent of Australia, which, \ndespite its distance,
  maintained close ties with America.\n\nThese frontiers of influence were strengthened
  with the formation of a military \nalliance system in Western Europe in 1949 and
  in eastern Asia in the early 1950s. But \nthe frontiers on opposite sides of the
  world did not yet connect. To complete the \ncircle, the United States gained allies
  in the 1950s among the nations of southern Asia, \nwhere political frontiers or
  perimeters were intermittently broken or lacked firmness. \nThe line of influence
  extended through Southeast Asia, including South Vietnam, Laos, \nand Cambodia.
  It continued along the northern boundaries of divided Pakistan, Iran, \nand Turkey,
  though India and Burma declared neutrality after gaining independence \nfrom Great
  Britain. The frontier was buttressed by rugged natural barriers that ran the \nlength
  of the Himalaya range from the Khyber Pass, past the gates of India, to the \nsouthern
  shores of the Caspian Sea, around the great deserts above the Persian Gulf, \nto,
  once again, the Caucasus, the Dardanelles, and Europe.\n\nSuch was the state of
  the frontiers of American interest as they developed from \nWorld War II into the
  1950s. They were not the borders of an empire that held \nterritory under a single
  sovereign authority. The United States was a republic and its \nprincipal means
  of establishing influence were aid, commerce, and diplomacy, though it \ncame to
  offer protection against belligerents. It assumed the role of a primary power \nfor
  which no other could substitute. Along the frontiers of this defensive area, the
  \nAmericans confronted a revolutionary and mighty adversary, the Russians, and their
  \nmassive nation with adjacent satellites.\n\nTo the allied states along this frontier,
  the promise of American aid and defense \nreached, and from those lands this influence
  was never to retreat under coercion of \naggressors. On the European frontier the
  American pledge had no foreseeable end: \n\"continuous,\" declared the treaty that
  united under American protection the Western \nEuropean empires of Britain, France,
  the Netherlands, Belgium, and Denmark. In the \nPacific, to the Philippines, and
  later to Australia and New Zealand, the American \ncommitments would remain in force
  \"indefinitely.\" As for Japan, no change in its \ndeference to the United States
  for its defense or to America's exclusive right to bases \ncould take place without
  American consultation. In Southeast Asia, too, the Americans \npromised not to yield,
  and again the term \"indefinitely\" applied. American treaties were \nopen to review
  by sovereign nations, but those commitments implied, no less than \nrespect for
  the sovereignty of the allies, that the Americans intended never to surrender a
  \nfoot of territory to aggressor nations. The Americans had never lost a war; the
  United \nStates would not retreat. Where the strategic frontier lay at its farthest
  extent, in \nSoutheast Asia, President Dwight Eisenhower compared the borderland
  to \"a leaky dike, \nand with leaky dikes it's sometimes better to put a finger
  in than to let the whole \nstructure be washed away.\"\n\nIt is these dimensions
  of space and time that provide a context in which the trade, \ncultural exchange,
  and battles fought in defense of American influence took place. Let us \nnow continue
  not by reciting these events but rather by seeking to explain how and why \na seaboard
  nation swelled into a world state. What are the origins of America's world \nrole?\n\n\nAmericans
  at midcentury dealt with the glories and problems of power as the people of \nevery
  preceding age had done, but their global power was distinguished by its magnitude.
  \nAs World War II was drawing to a close, in late 1944 President Roosevelt reflected,
  \"At \nthe end of this war this country will have the greatest material power of
  any Nation in \nthe world. It will be a clean, shining America.\" He attributed
  America's rise to an \nexpanding economy of peaceful production, richer than any
  other in skilled workers, and \nadvanced in engineering, farming, business, and
  technological knowhow.\n\nGovernment officials envisioned the same exceptional rise
  to power. Explanations \nof it varied, however. Harry Hopkins, an intimate adviser
  to the president, agreed. \"We \nwill emerge from this war the richest and most
  powerful people in the world.\" The \nUnited States alone, of all the great powers,
  would possess lands unscarred, a people \nwell nourished, and a breadbasket filled
  to overflowing. \"We will have the largest navy \nand merchant fleet on the seven
  seas, more airplanes than any other nation. Already a \ntechnological people before
  the war, we will find ourselves, as the result of our work in \nmunitions factories,
  with the largest army of skilled workers in history. Our industrial \nproduction
  capacity, vaster than the combined capacity of our Allies, will be sufficient, \nonce
  converted to the uses of peace, to fill consumer needs at home and, at the same
  \ntime, to supply ... heavy goods ... for rehabilitation abroad. Our raw materials
  and \nnatural resources ... will be sufficient, with wise stewardship, to last for
  generations. \nBut, above all, we will emerge with our democratic institutions intact,
  a people free to \nshape our destiny as we see fit.\"\n\nSoon after succeeding to
  the presidency, Truman made an even more ambitious \nclaim for America's rise. \"We
  tell ourselves that we have emerged from this war,\" he \nremarked in a radio address
  in August 1945, \"the most powerful nation in the \nworld--the most powerful nation,
  perhaps, in all history. That is true, but not in the \nsense some of us believe
  it to be true.\" The war had shown Truman that the United \nStates had tremendous
  material resources, skilled workers, managers, able generals, and \na brave people
  capable of bearing arms. \"The new thing--the thing which we had not \nknown--the
  thing we have learned now and should never forget, is this: that a society \nof
  self-governing men is more powerful, more enduring, more creative than any other
  \nkind of society, however disciplined, however centralized.\"\n\nCampaigning for
  the presidency in his own right in 1948, Truman barnstormed the \ncountry to convey
  to citizens the world-changing importance of their power. He \nhammered away at
  this theme from the back platform of the presidential train and in \nbig-city convention
  halls and stadiums:\n\nTrenton, Missouri, September 18: \"this country will continue
  for another\nthousand years as the greatest country in the world.\"\n\nDayton, Ohio,
  October 11: \"Now, this great Republic--the greatest in history,\nthe greatest that
  the sun has ever shone upon--is charged with leadership in the\nworld for the welfare
  of the whole world as well as our own welfare.\"\nNot only political leaders but
  also editors, columnists, and writers proclaimed \nAmerica's extraordinary rise.
  In early 1941 Henry Luce had decided to throw the \nweight of his publishing empire
  behind an effort to explain the emergence of the United \nStates as a dominant power.
  Neil MacNeil, an editor of the New York Times, stating in \n1944 that for a time
  \"the United States must remain the most powerful of world \npowers,\" listed American
  assets in a particular order: the \"most powerful navy that has \never sailed the
  five oceans\"; the \"biggest and hardest hitting air force that the world \nhas
  ever known\"; the greatest national industrial output on earth; the largest merchant
  \nmarine at sea; the largest number of transport and commercial airplanes in the
  sky; an \nagricultural plant capable of feeding Americans and contributing more
  than any other to \nfeeding hungry peoples; the \"greatest national production of
  steel, petroleum, cotton \nand other vital products\"; a domain located in the Western
  Hemisphere; and vast \nholdings of monetary gold and silver. Writing in Reader's
  Digest, Harry Scherman, a \npopular journalist, called America simply \"the most
  powerful nation in history.\"\n\nGovernment policy analysts examined in secret the
  status of national power. \nFollowing a request in 1948 by Secretary of Defense
  James Forrestal for a study of \"the \nproportion of our resources which should
  be devoted to military purposes,\" the National \nSecurity Council produced a series
  of reports. The most comprehensive consideration of \nAmerica's possession of \"superior
  overall power,\" the document numbered NSC 68, \nwhich Truman approved in 1950,
  cited as vital components \"a unique degree of unity\" in \nsociety, \"the capability
  of the American economy,\" and \"military strength,\" including \natomic armaments.
  The NSC subsequently sent a report to President Eisenhower, \nadvising again that
  the American position as the \"leader of the free world\" was sustained \nby a \"strong
  military posture,\" a \"sound, strong and growing economy,\" and a high \n\"morale
  and free institutions,\" to which were added \"sufficient atomic weapons and \neffective
  means of delivery.\" The implication of the national security papers, even those
  \nof different administrations, was that to maintain superiority over the Soviet
  Union, the \nUnited States had to develop its assets to their maximum potential.\n\nThese
  ideas were not entirely new. Leaders had been assessing America's rise in the \nworld
  from the beginning of the Republic. In 1780 John Adams told the French foreign \nminister,
  comte de Vergennes, that the \"United States of America are a great and \npowerful
  people, whatever European statesmen may think of them.\" The country, \nAdams asserted,
  had unbounded possibilities for the future because of its enormous \nterritorial
  expanse, embracing rich soil, mild climate, and incalculably plentiful natural \nresources,
  and because of the American people, rapidly expanding in numbers, and their \nproduction
  of agricultural goods for trade abroad.\n\nYet only in the late nineteenth century
  did the nation become widely recognized as a \nworld power. William McKinley was
  the first modern president to claim that American \npower was the greatest in the
  world. In 1892, before assuming office, he quoted from an \narticle written fourteen
  years earlier by the British statesman William Gladstone in the \nNorth American
  Review. England and America, Gladstone said, were then \"the two \nstrongest nations
  in the world, but there can hardly be a doubt as between the America \nand the England
  of the future that the daughter, at some no very distant time, whether \nfairer
  or less fair, will be unquestionably yet stronger than the mother.\" To McKinley
  \nthat \"no very distant time\" suddenly arrived in the early 1890s. \"America,\"
  he said, \n\"`whether fairer or less fair'--certainly freer--is now `stronger than
  the mother.'\" \nAmerica had become the strongest nation in the world because \"her
  power lies in a free \nand intelligent and progressive people,\" as well as in a
  strong, expanding economy and in \nsocial well-being. The Spanish-American War,
  a quick triumph resulting in the \nacquisition of an overseas empire in the Caribbean
  and the Pacific, dramatically \nconfirmed for McKinley America's rise to world-power
  status.\n\nVictory in World War I revealed the enormous strength and potential of
  the \nindustrialized continental nation. At the close of the conflict, President
  Woodrow Wilson \nstated that the United States was \"a nation as powerful as any
  in the world,\" yet it alone \nhad achieved \"the primacy of the world.\" If America
  joined the League of Nations, \nWilson declared, the country would be \"partners\"
  with the other powers. But, he added, \n\"let me predict we will be the senior partner.
  The financial leadership will be ours. The \nindustrial primacy will be ours. The
  commercial advantage will be ours. The other \ncountries of the world are looking
  to us for leadership and direction.\" Through the \n\"growth of our power,\" Wilson
  said, \"we have become a determining factor in the \nhistory of mankind.\" Industry
  and capital continued to grow through the 1920s, and so \ndid the nation's economic
  prowess. Advances in education, science, invention, \nefficiency, and production
  were among the factors that led Herbert Hoover to claim that \nAmerica had attained
  a \"position of transcendent power.\"\n\nThe attributes contemporaries accorded
  to this progress in each period were largely \nunanalyzed. They made lists of divergent
  factors--material and psychological, human \nand technological, peaceful and military--but
  these lists did not adequately distinguish \none item from another. Enumerations
  did not indicate what was a significant \ndevelopment and what was not. We seek
  some structure of thought and analysis in an \neffort to understand why the United
  States became capable of exercising world \ninfluence.\n\n\nAn extensive attempt
  to comprehend the rise and decline of nations came in a new \nschool in international
  politics that emerged around the theory of power politics. \nUnder the impetus of
  world war, political scientists and strategists developed this \ntheory in the 1930s
  and made it popular in the 1940s, believing that it was the only \nrealistic way
  to see the world; hence their common name, \"realists.\" They were direct \nabout
  pursuing the national interest: a nation that abandoned self-preservation as the
  \nchief motive of its policy risked its very survival.\n\nOne of the ablest of the
  early realists was Nicholas John Spykman, a political \nscientist at Yale, who stressed
  in 1942 that all civilized life rested \"in the last instance \non power.\" Without
  power, he believed, no social progress was possible. Mechanical \npower--the ability
  to move mass--was the product of technology, and political \npower--the ability
  to move people--put technology at the service of society.\n\nSpykman was baffled
  as to why power had a \"bad name.\" He argued that \nAmericans were wrong to condemn
  power as connoting evil, because power was only a \nmeans to an end. Sometimes the
  end was worthy, and in any case people were \npursuing power with whole-hearted
  devotion. In ladies' sewing circles, he gathered, no \nless than in struggles between
  nations, power was a fact of life. A sound and practical \nforeign policy, Spykman
  stressed, should be designed \"in terms of the realities of \ninternational relations,
  in terms of power politics.\" Already supposed to be in \npossession of unquestioned
  hegemony over a large part of the New World, the United \nStates, Spykman predicted,
  should be expected in the post-World War II era to \nexercise its power in all parts
  of the world in pursuit of its interests.\n\nA year before the close of the war,
  William T. R. Fox, a research associate at the \nYale Institute of International
  Studies, gave currency to the idea of a new status to which \nsquirrels and elephants.
  He was quick to explain that the Soviet Union and the \nDominican Republic were
  not both elephants, nor were they both squirrels; and he \nwanted to make clear
  that \"we are not fighting to make them both squirrels.\" For Fox, the \nelephants
  mattered most in keeping the postwar peace. Differences in power would \ncontinue
  to exist among nations, he said, and the problems of the world would not be \nsolved
  by endeavors to create a world of \"no-power politics.\" Fox, like Spykman, \ninsisted
  that power itself was ethically neutral. He urged Americans to recognize that \npower
  was a basic feature of political life and that it made \"the most enormous difference
  \nin whose hands predominant power rests.\" After the war, he predicted, the United
  \nStates would be rated as greater than a regional power restricted to a single
  area. As a \nsuperpower, it would have interests and influence from the East to
  the West. \"'Great \npower plus great mobility of power' describes the super-power,\"
  he claimed.\n\nThe political scientist Hans J. Morgenthau did more than any other
  figure to \nestablish the realist interpretation of international affairs. In 1948
  he published his \nclassic treatise Politics among Nations: The Struggle for Power
  and Peace, which argued \nthat struggle for power was the essence of international
  affairs. Born in Germany in \n1904, Morgenthau fled to Switzerland to escape Hitler
  and in 1937 emigrated to the \nUnited States, where he found the study of international
  affairs disorganized. While \nteaching at Brooklyn College, later at the University
  of Kansas and, beginning in \n1943--the year he became a citizen--at the University
  of Chicago, he criticized the \nwriting in his field by historians and international
  lawyers as overly legalistic and \nidealistic. Morgenthau brought from the Old World
  a pessimism about man's nature and \nthe state of the world, while his scholarly
  work led him to believe that objective truths \nabout politics could be discovered
  by human reason. His wealth of knowledge enabled \nhim to lecture to his classes
  on world politics without a text; one of his students took a \nstenographic transcript
  of what he said, which became the draft of his book.\n\nMorgenthau directly related
  his power theories to the observation that \"the United \nStates is at the moment
  of this writing the most powerful nation on earth.\" He was \nintrigued with the
  problems and rivalries this power created. \"International politics,\" he \nwrote,
  \"like all politics, is a struggle for power.\" Power was more than brutal force,
  it \nwas the central aim of national interest. He proposed that the pursuit of power
  was the \nsource of state behavior. No matter what the ultimate aims of nations,
  whether freedom, \nsecurity, or prosperity, their immediate goal was power. Power
  was the means to \nnational ends. Political power meant \"man's control over the
  minds and actions of other \nmen.\" It followed that power was also \"a psychological
  relationship between those who \nexercise it and those over whom it is exercised,\"
  enabling some people to control the \nactions of others through orders, threats,
  persuasion, or a combination of these. Since he \nhad traced the struggle for power
  back through history, he believed the contest for power \nmust be ever-present.\n\nMorgenthau,
  impatient with moral sentiment or wishful idealism, believed that the \npursuit
  of power was not necessarily immoral. \"To act successfully,\" he wrote in \nScientific
  Man vs. Power Politics in 1946,\" ... is political wisdom. To know with \ndespair
  that the political act is inevitably evil, and to act nevertheless, is moral courage.
  \nTo choose among several expedient actions the least evil one is moral judgment.
  In the \ncombination of political wisdom, moral courage, and moral judgment, man
  reconciles his \npolitical nature with his moral destiny.\"\n\nThe chief opponents
  of the realists were the humanitarian moralists who saw the \nworld from a different,
  ethical perspective. Of a longstanding tradition in the nineteenth \ncentury, the
  moralists included philosophers and writers who attributed America's rising \nworld
  influence not to external force but to the internal example of a society. They \nopposed
  the power politics and imperialism of Europe. One of the early, clearsighted \nmoralists
  was Albert Gallatin, who wrote \"The Mission of the United States\" at the \ntime
  of the Mexican War. \"Your mission was, to be a model for all other governments\"
  \nand \"to apply all your faculties to the gradual improvement of your own institutions\"
  \nand, \"by your example, to exert a moral influence most beneficial to mankind
  at large. \nInstead of this, an appeal has been made to your worst passions; to
  cupidity, to the \nthirst of unjust aggrandizement by brutal force; to the love
  of military fame and of false \nglory.\" Aware that the world powers of the past
  had been empires and monarchies, the \nmoralists argued that the United States should
  not act imperially in emulation of them \nbut rather show the way to reform by exhibiting
  the success of its democratic society. \nMorgenthau pointed to John C. Calhoun and
  William Graham Sumner as worthy \nrepresentatives of this world perspective, the
  latter writing during the \nSpanish-American War that \"expansionism and imperialism
  are at war with the best \ntraditions, principles, and interests of the American
  people.\"\n\nThe realists responded that in the past the moralists could afford
  to advocate that \ntheir nation be small and inconsequential but virtuous. After
  all, they had lived on a \ncontinent insulated from the outside. But their legacy
  threatened to damage the national \ninterest, which required growing world involvement.
  Even when leaders made decisions \nfor \"realistic\" actions, the realists contended,
  they had been perverted by irrelevant \nmoralistic justifications. A case in point
  was President McKinley's defense of colonizing \nthe Philippines: after prayer in
  the wee hours of the morning, he revealed, he had heard \nthe voice of God tell
  him to annex the islands.\n\nOf all the spokesmen of the moralistic point of view,
  Woodrow Wilson was the \nmost eloquent and his thought the most far-reaching. His
  conviction, well founded in \nnineteenth-century liberal thought and the ethical
  standards of Christian and Calvinistic \ntheology, was that democracy and constitutional
  government would temper the \nmaneuvers of the big powers. \"It is a very perilous
  thing,\" he said in an address in \nMobile, Alabama, in October 1913, \"to determine
  the foreign policy of a nation in the \nterms of material interest. It not only
  is unfair to those with whom you are dealing, but \nit is degrading as regards your
  own actions.... We dare not turn from the principle that \nmorality and not expediency
  is the thing that must guide us.\"\n\nThe realists countered that however much Wilson
  had wanted to \"make the world \nsafe for democracy,\" he had relied on the American
  army to achieve his ends. Wilson had \nfully recognized the historical implications
  of America's economic rise. But he \nwanted to help shape the peace at Versailles
  on the moral principles of democracy. After \nhis return in 1919, he declared in
  Los Angeles: \"The day we have left behind us ... was a \nday of balances of power.
  It was a day of `every nation take care of itself or make a \npartnership with some
  other nation or group of nations to hold the peace of the world \nsteady or to dominate
  the weaker portions of the world.' Those were the days of \nalliances. This project
  of the League of Nations is a great process of disentanglement.\" \nThe league was
  supposed to be a democratic organization of the world's nations, \nAmerica's contribution
  to a general world order.\n\nCongress, however, rejected the Treaty of Versailles.
  When Sen. Henry Cabot \nLodge introduced a series of reservations restricting the
  league's jurisdiction, Wilson, \nfearing the destruction of the democratic intent
  of the league, refused to accept them. In \nthe end, the moral example of democratic
  aspiration in isolation at home failed to \nreconcile foreign nationalistic demands
  voiced around the world. The league, which had \nno other power than that of its
  member states, was helpless to prevent Japanese \nexpansion in Manchuria and China,
  Italy's conquest of Ethiopia, and Hitler's repudiation \nof the Versailles settlement.\n\nThese
  crises threw American thought about the world in turmoil, and World War II \ngave
  impetus to the intellectual tradition of the realists. After the war Morgenthau's
  \nPolitics among Nations became probably the most influential textbook of its time,
  read \nby specialists and students for the framework it offered in the field of
  world affairs. By \nmid-century the preoccupation with power politics and the struggle
  for political and \nmilitary power had largely replaced the economic doctrines that
  Lenin and Charles Beard \nhad expounded as the basis of world affairs in earlier
  days.\n\nRealism entered the plane of government and diplomacy. Influential among
  the \nrealists who applied theory to policy was George Kennan, a student of history,
  \ndiplomat, policy analyst, and expert on Soviet affairs. Kennan believed that the
  most \nserious fault of American policy was what he called the \"legalistic-moralistic
  approach to \ninternational problems.\" That approach he labeled idealistic, for
  it projected the common \nconcepts of American law and politics into international
  relations--as in the Hague \nconferences on disarmament, the Kellogg Pact to make
  war illegal, and the League of \nNations. Remarkably, Kennan asserted that realism
  would free foreign affairs from \nconcepts of right and wrong, and correct the \"assumption
  that state behavior is a fit \nsubject for moral judgment.... It is a curious thing,
  but it is true, that the legalistic \napproach to world affairs, rooted as it unquestionably
  is in a desire to do away with war \nand violence, makes violence more enduring,
  more terrible, and more destructive to \npolitical stability than did the older
  motives of national interest.\" Kennan pleaded in the \nearly 1950s for the realism
  of power politics--or, as he wrote, for whatever \"is realistic \nin concept, and
  founded in an endeavor to see both ourselves and others as we really \nare.\" In
  his cabled dispatches from Moscow to the State Department, Kennan \nurged--as strongly
  as in his later writings, including Realities of American Foreign \nPolicy--that
  relations with Russia be placed entirely on a \"realistic and \nmatter-of-fact basis,\"
  guided not by morality or altruism, but by the strengths and \nweaknesses of nations.\n\nThe
  nation's rise in the world, from the perspective of the realists, rested on power
  \nand its elements, which included geography, natural resources, population, industrial
  \ndevelopment, military ability, and national morale. The balance of power enabled
  the \nUnited States in the mid-twentieth century to pursue interests in remote regions
  of the \nearth through trade, cultural activity, and war. Opposed as it was to moralism,
  realism \nnevertheless reflected not merely a concern for fact or reality but also
  a regard for \nelemental power as force and influence. Realism was a way of looking
  at the world, \ncomprehended as power politics. For our purposes, power is defined
  as the qualities or \nproperties that make possible the national exertion of influence
  or force in the world. \nPower, in this sense, means essentially capability rather
  than actual force or influence, \nthough we may find that the ways influence was
  exerted might indeed eventually \nenhance or weaken the power that supported it.\n\nOur
  attempt to understand the origins of America's world role turns now to the \nthemes
  of the elements and balance of power. We will first examine the various reasons
  \nfor the balance of power that contemporaries set forth according to their rational
  beliefs \nabout the world. Our work, as the study progresses, is to analyze these
  explanations \nand to weigh them for significance against the world with which contemporaries
  dealt.\n  (C) 1996  Donald W. White All rights reserved.  ISBN: 0-300-05721-0\n\n\n\nReturn
