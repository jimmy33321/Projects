                  ACADEMIC FREEDOM

- "             \n"
- |2
                  Academic freedom is the liberty of thought which
- |2
                      is claimed by teachers and other elements of the educa- tional community. While the claim to freedom of the
- |2
                      mind has a very long history—it was asserted in ancient Athens,
- |2
                      for example, by Socrates—academic freedom, as the more
- |2
                      specialized concern of the schools, is a rather modern phenomenon, having
- |2
                      been first recog- nized in some of the
- |2
                      universities of Western Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
- |2
                      Emerging in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the university in
- |2
                      the medieval age was to a considerable extent an autonomous corporate
- |2
                      institution, but the master or teacher was subject to powerful restraints,
- |2
                      both internal and external, and to the inhibiting force of authori- tative tradition. Beginning with
- |2
                      the founding of the university at Leiden in 1575, academic freedom began010
- |2
                       to take root in the Western world, albeit very slowly, as a
- |2
                      consequence of the gradual development of an atmosphere of tolerance
- |2
                      nurtured by the rise of reli- gious,
- |2
                      political, and economic liberalism, and the growth of the so-called new
- |2
                      sciences. Francis Bacon'sAdvancement of Learning (1605) proclaimed the phil- osophical underpinning of the case for
- |2
                      freedom of experimental inquiry with respect to the new sciences. The
- |2
                      fierce, destructive, sectarian religious and political conflicts which
- |2
                      characterized the struggle between the Reformation and the
- |2
                      Counter-Reformation led a deci- mated and
- |2
                      exhausted Western Europe to comprehend the values of toleration. The steady
- |2
                      growth of com- merce, which, among other
- |2
                      things, drew attention to the desirable consequences of competitive
- |2
                      enterprise, together with the rise of the liberal state, led to the
- |2
                      emergence of a philosophy of knowledge which stressed the basic contingency
- |2
                      of ideas, and the utility of testing the value of ideas, not in terms of
- |2
                      the power of those who espoused them, but rather in terms of their
- |2
                      capacity to stand up under the competition of other ideas. There was a
- |2
                      logical transition from the competition of the marketplace to the
- |2
                      competition of ideas.
- |2
                  While academic freedom has by no means achieved universal acceptance in the
- |2
                      contemporary world, it is accepted as the normal expectation in most
- |2
                      countries of Western Europe, with the exception of the dictator- ships on the Iberian peninsula. It
- |2
                      is not accepted by the communist or communist-dominated countries in
- |2
                      Central and Eastern Europe and in Asia. It is significant that academic
- |2
                      freedom is regarded, at least in princi- ple,
- |2
                      as a necessary and desirable aspect of higher edu-
- |2
                          cation in many of the developing countries of Africa, the Middle
- |2
                      East, and the Far East. In the many coun-
- |2
                      tries where academic freedom is understood and re- spected, however, there are two uses of the term
- |2
                      which, if not fundamentally different, seem to differ in their points
- |2
                      of emphasis. Thus, in Great Britain the term generally refers to the
- |2
                      freedom of the educational institution as a whole from outside influences,
- |2
                      political or otherwise.
- |2
                  While this usage of the term is by no means unknown in the United States, in
- |2
                      America it almost invariably refers to the freedom of the individual
- |2
                      professor. Of course, outside influences are often brought to bear
- |2
                      upon American colleges and universities, and the con-
- |2
                          cept of academic freedom requires the institution to resist any
- |2
                      attacks upon its freedom to act as a corporate body. Nevertheless, in
- |2
                      accordance with the individ- ualistic
- |2
                      tendency of the concept of rights in American constitutional law, the claim
- |2
                      to academic freedom is generally stated and tested in terms of
- |2
                      individual teachers. Whatever may be the force of outside influ
- |2
                      ences, the concept holds that the institution has an obligation
- |2
                      to protect the rights of academic freedom for all of its faculty members.
- |2
                      Since the ultimate power of control over an American college or university
- |2
                      is vested in its governing board, a dismissal in violation of a
- |2
                      professor's academic freedom simply cannot hap-
- |2
                      pen unless the board decrees it. It follows that in the American
- |2
                      system of higher education, responsibility for protecting the academic
- |2
                      freedom of teachers rests with those who are legally in control of the
- |2
                      institution, and who have the power not only to condone violations of
- |2
                      that freedom, for example, by making improper dismissals, but also the
- |2
                      power to protect the faculty against outside pressures and to defend their
- |2
                      freedom. American experience indicates that even though a university
- |2
                      may enjoy complete institutional autonomy, so far as external pressures are
- |2
                      concerned, it is still possible for the university's administration to act
- |2
                      in a manner which is injurious to the faculty's claim to academic
- |2
                      freedom.

- "                \n"
- |2
                  Academic freedom is usually described as the right of each individual member
- |2
                      of the faculty of an institu- tion to enjoy
- |2
                      the freedom to study, to inquire, to speak his mind, to communicate his
- |2
                      ideas, and to assert the truth as he sees it. In the United States, the
- |2
                      professor's academic freedom is often defined in terms of full freedom
- |2
                      in research and in the publication of the results, in classroom discussion
- |2
                      of his subject, and in the exercise extra-murally of his basic rights as a
- |2
                          citi- zen. But in America, and increasingly
- |2
                      in other parts of the world, the concept of academic freedom has been
- |2
                      broadened to include students as well as teachers. The freedom of the
- |2
                      professor to teach is merely one side of the coin of academic freedom, the
- |2
                      other side being the freedom of the student to learn.
- |2
                  In the historical sense this concept is neither very novel nor particularly
- |2
                      American. It was a familiar point in the great days of German higher
- |2
                      education, during the half century preceding World War I, that a close
- |2
                      affinity between Lehrfreiheit and Lernfreiheit was rec- ognized,
- |2
                      though for the student the freedom to learn assumed characteristics not
- |2
                      generally to be found in other countries. Once he had received the abitur (an examination taken at age 19 or 20, at the

                      end of thegymnasium period), he was free to wander from school
- |2
                      to school, to attend classes as he chose, and to take examinations whenever
- |2
                      he felt prepared, and to try again if he failed. Otherwise he was never
- |2
                      given grades and the flunk-out for unsatisfactory scholarship was
- |2
                      unknown. This sort of student freedom was not widely practiced or
- |2
                      recognized in other countries.

                  By the third quarter of the twentieth century, uni-011

- |2
                      versity students in the United States, and indeed all other
- |2
                      elements of the university community, became more and more interested in
- |2
                      those aspects of academic freedom which are of immediate concern to
- |2
                      students. Various student associations began to draft statements of
- |2
                      specific rights which they thought they were entitled to claim as against
- |2
                      interference by college and univer- sity
- |2
                      authorities. Civil liberties organizations and pro- fessorial groups also became active in this effort to
- |2
                      spell out the academic freedom rights of the students. This activity
- |2
                      produced, in 1967, a Joint Statement on Rights and
- |2
                          Freedoms of Students, drafted by a joint committee made up of
- |2
                      representatives of the American Associa-
- |2
                      tion of University Professors, the U. S. National Student
- |2
                      Association, the Association of American Colleges, the National Association
- |2
                      of Student Personnel Adminis- trators,
- |2
                      and the National Association of Women Deans and Counselors. Other
- |2
                      educational associations have endorsed the Statement
- |2
                      since its formulation, and thus it is rapidly acquiring standing as an
- |2
                      authoritative statement of desirable normative principles.
- |2
                  The Statement points out that “freedom to teach
- |2
                      and freedom to learn are inseparable facets of academic
- |2
                      freedom.” It is noted that since “free inquiry and
- |2
                      free expression are indispensable to the attainment” of the
- |2
                      goals of academic institutions—which are: “the trans- mission of knowledge, the pursuit of
- |2
                      truth, the devel- opment of students, and
- |2
                      the general well-being of
- |2
                      society”—“students should be encouraged to
- |2
                      develop the capacity for critical judgment and to engage in a
- |2
                      sustained and independent search for truth.” To this end, the
- |2
                          Statement spells out the rights of students as
- |2
                      regards institutional admission policies, in the class- room, in respect to student records, student affairs,
- |2
                      and off-campus activities. In the area of student affairs, various
- |2
                      standards are stated with respect to freedom of association, freedom of
- |2
                      inquiry and expression, par- ticipation in
- |2
                      institutional government, and student publications. A detailed final
- |2
                      section seeks to delineate, with considerable particularity, procedural
- |2
                      standards in disciplinary proceedings, to the end that students may
- |2
                      enjoy a full measure of due process.

- |2
                  The fundamental case for academic freedom has always been that while it
- |2
                      confers desired benefits upon the professors who enjoy it, it is defensible
- |2
                      mainly on the ground that the unhampered search for the truth is for
- |2
                      the benefit of society as a whole. A basic premiss is that final truth in
- |2
                      all branches of human knowledge has not yet been achieved, and that new
- |2
                      truths will emerge only as ideas clash with ideas in an unrestricted
- |2
                      marketplace of ideas. In the words of Cardinal New-
- |2
                      man (1872), a true university or college is a place “in
- |2
                       which the intellect may safely range and speculate, sure to
- |2
                      find its equal in some antagonistic activity, and its judge in the tribunal
- |2
                      of truth. It is a place where inquiry is pushed forward, and discoveries
- |2
                      verified and perfected, and rashness rendered innocuous, and error
- |2
                      exposed, by the collision of mind with mind, and knowledge with
- |2
                      knowledge” (“What is a University?,”Historical Sketches [1872], I, 16). Thus it has been
- |2
                      asserted that academic freedom exists “in order that society may
- |2
                      have the benefit of honest judgment and independent criticism which
- |2
                      otherwise might be with- held because of fear
- |2
                      of offending a dominant group or transient social attitude”
- |2
                      (Clark Byse and Louis Joughin, Tenure in American Higher
- |2
                          Education [1959], p. 4).
- |2
                  The eminent scholars (including the distinguished historian of ideas, Arthur
- |2
                      O. Lovejoy) who founded the American Association of University Professors
- |2
                      in 1915 published a Declaration of Principles which
- |2
                      stated the rationale for academic freedom that has been generally
- |2
                      accepted by the American academic community. They pointed out that while
- |2
                      professors are the appointees of the university's trustees, they are not in
- |2
                      any proper sense the trustees' employees, just as federal judges are
- |2
                      appointed by the President without becoming, as a consequence, the Chief
- |2
                      Executive's employees. “For, once appointed,” they
- |2
                      declared, “the scholar has pro-
- |2
                          fessional functions to perform in which the appointing
- |2
                      authorities have neither competency nor moral right to
- |2
                      intervene.” And they added: “A university is a great
- |2
                      and indispensable organ of the higher life of a civilized community, in the
- |2
                      work of which the trustees hold an essential and highly honorable place,
- |2
                      but in which the faculties hold an independent place, with quite equal
- |2
                      responsibilities—and in relation to purely scientific and
- |2
                      educational questions, the primary responsibility.” Stressing
- |2
                      the nature of the academic calling, they wrote that “if
- |2
                      education is the cornerstone of the structure of society, and if progress
- |2
                      in scientific knowledge is essential to civilization, few things can be
- |2
                      more impor- tant than to enhance the dignity
- |2
                      of the scholar's pro- fession, with a view to
- |2
                      attracting to its ranks men of the highest ability, of sound learning, and
- |2
                      of strong and independent character.”
- |2
                  A similar conception of the nature of academic freedom has, in recent years,
- |2
                      been adopted by the United States Supreme Court. Speaking for the
- |2
                      Court in 1957, Chief Justice Warren declared:
- "                \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          The essentiality of freedom in the community of American
- |2
                              universities is almost self-evident. No one should underes- timate the vital role in a
- |2
                              democracy that is played by those who guide and train our youth. To
- |2
                              impose any strait jacket upon the intellectual leaders in our
- |2
                              colleges and universities would imperil the future of our Nation.
- |2
                              No field of education012
- |2
                               is so thoroughly comprehended by man that new
- |2
                              discoveries cannot yet be made. Particularly is that true in the
- |2
                              social sciences, where few, if any, principles are accepted as
- |2
                              absolutes. Scholarship cannot flourish in an atmosphere of
- |2
                              suspicion and distrust. Teachers and students must always remain
- |2
                              free to inquire, to study and to evaluate, to gain new maturity and
- |2
                              understanding; otherwise our civilization will stagnate and die

                  Similarly, in a concurring opinion filed in this case, Justice Frankfurter

                      wrote:

                          These pages need not be burdened with proof, based on the testimony
- |2
                              of a cloud of impressive witnesses, of the dependence of a free
- |2
                              society on free universities. This means the exclusion of
- |2
                              governmental intervention in the intellec-
- |2
                                  tual life of a university. It matters little whether
- |2
                              such intervention occurs avowedly or through action that in- evitably tends to check the ardor
- |2
                              and fearlessness of scholars, qualities at once so fragile and so
- |2
                              indispensable for fruitful academic labor

- "                \n"
- |2
                  More recently, again speaking for the Supreme Court, Justice Brennan
- |2
                      observed:
- "                \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          Our Nation is deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom,
- |2
                              which is of transcendent value to all of us and not merely to the
- |2
                              teachers concerned. That freedom is therefore a special concern of
- |2
                              the First Amendment, which does not tolerate laws that cast a pall
- |2
                              of orthodoxy over the classroom. “The vigilant
- |2
                              protection of constitutional freedom is nowhere more vital than in
- |2
                              the community of American schools.”... The classroom is
- |2
                              peculiarly the “marketplace of ideas.” The
- |2
                              Nation's future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure
- |2
                              to that robust ex- change of ideas
- |2
                              which discovers truth “out of a multitude of tongues,

                              [rather] than through any kind of authoritative

- |2
                  Thus, by the late 1960's, the concept of academic freedom had been accepted
- |2
                      by the United States Su- preme Court as an
- |2
                      integral part of the civil liberties law of the country. This concept was
- |2
                      by then also regarded by the academic community as an essential
- |2
                      element of the American system of intellectual free-
- |2
                          dom. It was widely believed that the schools play an
- |2
                      indispensable role in the progress of civilization, that the colleges and
- |2
                      universities were the country's most important instruments for the
- |2
                      generation and testing of new ideas and the advancement of scientific knowl- edge, and for the training of new
- |2
                      leadership in govern- ment, in the
- |2
                      professions, and in the economy. Since leaders in a rapidly changing world
- |2
                      should not be slaves to routine, but must, on the contrary, be able to
- |2
                      take the initiative, handle new ideas, solve new problems, evaluate
- |2
                      evidence, think rationally, and act purpose-
- |2
                      fully, it was felt that only a free educational system
- |2
                       can produce such leadership. In a broader sense, it was widely
- |2
                      understood that in a fluid, open, democratic society, in which the legally
- |2
                      protected right to dissent inevitably creates an atmosphere of controversy,
- |2
                      the schools cannot insulate their students from controversy, since
- |2
                      this would leave them unprepared to take their rightful places in a society
- |2
                      in which controversy is a daily and indispensable condition. Furthermore,
- |2
                      a democratic, self-governing society cannot afford the risk of having
- |2
                      an ignorant and unenlightened citizenry. Self-government means that the
- |2
                      citizen must be able to govern himself, that is to say, to control his
- |2
                      emotions, to use his reason, and to be concerned with the public
- |2
                      interest. To this end the schools, functioning in an atmosphere of academic
- |2
                      freedom, make a weighty contribution. It follows that the freedom of
- |2
                      teachers to teach and of students to learn is essential to democ- racy, to progress, to the security of a
- |2
                      way of life com- mitted to the maximizing of
- |2
                      human freedom.

- |2
                  The world over, wherever the principle of academic freedom has been
- |2
                      understood and respected, it has been closely tied to the concept of
- |2
                      tenure, since security of employment is an essential precondition for
- |2
                      the unhampered exercise of academic freedom. While there are
- |2
                      variations on the general theme, the concept of tenure which has taken root
- |2
                      in the United States comes to this: after a teacher has served on a
- |2
                      faculty for a limited, prescribed number of years in proba- tionary status, he acquires a
- |2
                      permanent position.
- |2
                  The American Association of University Professors has sought, during the
- |2
                      past half century, to standardize the maximum duration of the probationary
- |2
                      period. The influential 1940 Statement of
- |2
                      Principles, which it nego- tiated with
- |2
                      the Association of American Colleges, and which has been endorsed by over
- |2
                      sixty learned societies since its adoption, prescribed that the maximum
- |2
                          dura- tion of the probationary period
- |2
                      should be seven years. That is to say, after a teacher has served on a
- |2
                      faculty for seven years in probationary status, the institution has an
- |2
                      obligation to make up its mind whether to let him go or keep him
- |2
                      permanently by granting him tenure. Tenure means that the teacher, having
- |2
                      been found adequate by the institution during the proba- tionary period, is now entitled to hold his position
- |2
                      until retirement. It is recognized, however, that the concept does not
- |2
                      mean that a tenured professor can never be dismissed under any conceivable
- |2
                      circumstances. On the contrary, it is agreed that the institution has a
- |2
                      right to dismiss a tenured professor, but only if there is adequate
- |2
                      cause for the dismissal, and only if adequate cause is established by
- |2
                      procedures which satisfy the rigorous demands of due process. In addition,
- |2
                      it is013
- |2
                       recognized that an institution may find it necessary to
- |2
                      terminate a continuous appointment because of finan-
- |2
                          cial exigency—though it is insisted, in the 1940 State- ment, that such
- |2
                      financial exigency “should be demon-
- |2
                          strably bona fide.”
- |2
                  The essence of the tenure concept, then, is the rec-
- |2
                          ognition of the right to serve until retirement, unless there is
- |2
                      an earlier dismissal for an adequate reason established through procedures
- |2
                      which measure up to the requirements of justice by assuring the
- |2
                      individual concerned the protection of due process. This means that
- |2
                      before the administration of an institution makes an unfavorable
- |2
                      recommendation to the governing board, the faculty member must be given a
- |2
                      statement of specific charges, served upon him long enough in advance
- |2
                      so that he has adequate time to prepare his defense. Following the service
- |2
                      of charges, he is entitled to be heard, in the first instance, by a faculty
- |2
                          commit- tee, preferably an elected
- |2
                      committee not directly con- trolled by the
- |2
                      administration. Due process also assures the individual all of the elements
- |2
                      of a fair hearing, such as the right to be heard in his own defense, the
- |2
                      right to counsel, the right to offer witnesses and to confront and
- |2
                      cross-examine witnesses who appear against him, and a right to a
- |2
                      stenographic record of all hearings. Due process also demands that findings
- |2
                      of fact and the ultimate decision should be based on the hearing rec- ord.
- |2
                  In addition, the burden of proof to establish the existence of adequate
- |2
                      cause for a dismissal is on those who brought the charges, since the grant
- |2
                      of tenure establishes a presumption of competence comparable to the
- |2
                      presumption of innocence which defendants enjoy in criminal cases. If the
- |2
                      faculty hearing commit- tee decides in favor
- |2
                      of the involved faculty member, the normal expectation is that the charges
- |2
                      will be dropped. If the administration persists in bringing the
- |2
                      charges to the governing body for final action, then that body is expected
- |2
                      to give the individual a hearing embracing all of the basic elements of due
- |2
                      process. When a faculty committee has made a decision favora- ble to the individual, then an especially heavy
- |2
                      burden of proof rests upon those who persist in pressing the charges.
- |2
                  Thus, the real protection for the tenured professor, so far as dismissal is
- |2
                      concerned, depends far more upon the procedures available to him, than upon
- |2
                      any sub- stantive definition of the term
- |2
                      academic freedom. Fur- thermore, while the
- |2
                      rules of academic due process seek to protect the professor against
- |2
                      injustice, they also protect the institution and its administration from
- |2
                          act- ing unjustly and making mistakes.
- |2
                      Speaking in the wider context of governmental action, Justice Jackson
- |2
                      urged that it should not be overlooked that “due proc
- |2
                      ess of law is not for the sole benefit of an accused. It is the
- |2
                      best insurance for the Government itself against those blunders which leave
- |2
                      lasting stains on a system of justice but which are bound to occur on
- |2
                      ex parte consideration” (Shaughnessy v.
- |2
                          United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206,
- |2
                      224-25 [1953], dissenting opinion). When a professor is dismissed
- |2
                      arbitrarily, without charges and a chance to be heard in a fair
- |2
                      proceeding, not only is the professor treated wrongly, but the institution
- |2
                      deprives itself of the benefits and guidance which would be secured by
- |2
                      following proper procedures. An arbitrary dismissal also prevents the
- |2
                      academic community from having confidence in the institution's course of
- |2
                      action, since there are bound to be doubts about the acceptability of
- |2
                      administrative decisions which were taken with faulty procedure. Due
- |2
                      process is regarded as vital for the academic commu-
- |2
                          nity, as it is in the general community, because it is society's
- |2
                      best assurance that the action was taken justly.

                  In the United States there are a number of associa-
- |2
                          tions concerned with defining and defending the pro- fessor's claim to academic freedom, such
- |2
                      as the Ameri- can Civil Liberties Union,
- |2
                      various teachers' unions, the American Association for Higher Education (an
- |2
                      affiliate of the National Educational Association), and many other
- |2
                      groups. Since its establishment in 1915, however, the chief spokesman for
- |2
                      the academic freedom rights of teachers in the world of higher education
- |2
                      has been the American Association of University Professors. Over the
- |2
                      years the Association has spelled out the content of academic freedom, both
- |2
                      substantive and procedural, in numerous statements of principles and
- |2
                      has dealt with specific complaints submitted to it by aggrieved professors.
- |2
                      Complaints alleging improper dismissals are referred to the Association's
- |2
                      oldest and most influential committee, Committee A, on Aca- demic Freedom and Tenure. During the past half cen- tury the Committee, with the assistance of
- |2
                      professional staff in the central office in Washington, has dealt with
- |2
                      hundreds of cases, and has developed a large and so- phisticated body of interpretations and common law
- |2
                      principles which relate to various aspects of academic freedom.
- |2
                  Once the General Secretary of the Association has concluded that there is a
- |2
                          prima facie case for believing that a
- |2
                      serious violation of an important principle of academic freedom and tenure
- |2
                      has occurred, he ap- points an investigating
- |2
                      committee of disinterested scholars. Following its investigation, the ad
- |2
                      hoc com- mittee reports to Committee A, which
- |2
                      then decides whether to accept the report, and whether it should be
- |2
                      published in the quarterly journal of the Association.014
- |2
                       Once a year, at the annual delegate meeting of the Association,
- |2
                      Committee A decides whether to recom- mend for
- |2
                      or against censure of the administration con-
- |2
                      cerned. The ultimate weapon of the Association is a public censure,
- |2
                      which is no more, and no less, than an expression of moral disapproval.
- |2
                      Through the in- strumentality of censure
- |2
                      the Association pronounces its special form of anathema upon the
- |2
                      administration of an institution, declaring that in its informed and
- |2
                      solemn judgment, proper conditions of academic free-
- |2
                          dom do not exist there. This is communicated to the academic
- |2
                      world through the Association's publications, through the mass media, and
- |2
                      through the efforts of other learned societies.
- |2
                  There is every reason to believe that this weapon of the Association is very
- |2
                      effective, even though it does not go beyond the expression of moral
- |2
                      disapproval. Administrations on censure are removed from the list by
- |2
                      vote of the annual delegate meeting of the Associa-
- |2
                          tion on the recommendation of Committee A. This occurs when it
- |2
                      has been decided that the dereliction which led to the censure action has
- |2
                      been corrected. Generally this takes the form of changes in the institu- tion's rules and procedures, and
- |2
                      the award to the in- jured party of some sort of
- |2
                      redress.
- |2
                  There are active associations of university teachers in the other
- |2
                      English-speaking countries, notably Great Britain, Canada, Australia, in
- |2
                      the Scandinavian coun- tries, and rather less
- |2
                      effective associations in most of the other countries of Western Europe. In
- |2
                      addition there is an International Association of University Pro- fessors and Lecturers, with a part-time
- |2
                          Secretary- General, but this is
- |2
                      essentially an association of auton- omous
- |2
                      national bodies, and is limited in activity to the holding of periodical
- |2
                      conferences and seminars.

- |2
                  The concept of academic freedom embraces more than mere protection against
- |2
                      arbitrary dismissals, though the central purpose of tenure is to protect
- |2
                      the teacher against such dismissals. In fact, professors often have
- |2
                      occasion to complain about many other forms of mistreatment. The American
- |2
                      Association, for example, has received frequent complaints about denial of
- |2
                      salary increases, or the receipt of increases below the average, or
- |2
                      the assignment of inconvenient hours or unwelcome courses, and other forms
- |2
                      of unwanted action taking the form and having the purpose of harassment. If
- |2
                          profes- sors are to be free from external
- |2
                      restraints in their pursuit of the truth, they must be as free from harass- ment as they are from the crippling
- |2
                      pressure of the possibility of summary dismissal. The American Asso- ciation of University Professors has
- |2
                      always taken the position that the best security against most forms of
- |2
                       harassment is to be found within the machinery of the
- |2
                      institution itself. Thus, an essential element of the prevailing American
- |2
                      conception of academic freedom is the principle of maximum faculty
- |2
                      participation in the decision-making processes of the institution.
- |2
                      Through faculty meetings, faculty committees, and other devices of
- |2
                      communication, the faculty, it is believed, can achieve a responsible place
- |2
                      in the making of institutional decisions. For example, institutions
- |2
                      are encouraged to have faculty grievance committees, built into the
- |2
                      official organizational system of the institution, for the adjustment of
- |2
                      complaints.
- |2
                  The whole concept of faculty involvement in insti-
- |2
                          tutional government took a giant step forward in 1966, when
- |2
                      three major groups in American higher educa-
- |2
                      tion, the American Council on Education, the Ameri- can Association of University Professors, and the As- sociation of Governing Boards of
- "                    Universities and Colleges, reached agreement on a joint Statement
  on Government of Colleges and Universities. This \n"
- |2
                          State- ment
- |2
                       recognizes that college or university government is the joint
- |2
                      responsibility of the various major elements of the academic community,
- |2
                      faculties, administrators, governing boards, and students, since, it is
- |2
                      noted, “the variety and complexity of the tasks performed by
- |2
                          insti- tutions of higher education
- |2
                      produce an inescapable interdependence” among them. Joint
- |2
                      efforts by all components of the institution are needed for effective
- |2
                      planning and communication, for budgeting, for the selection of the chief
- |2
                      academic officials, and for the optimum use of facilities. More
- |2
                      particularly, the tri- partite
- |2
                      Statement recognizes that the faculty has
- |2
                          “pri- mary
- |2
                      responsibility” with respect to curriculum, sub- ject matter and methods of instruction, research, and
- |2
                      those elements of student life which relate to the edu- cational process. The faculty determines the require- ments for the degrees offered in
- |2
                      courses, and decides when and how degree requirements have been met.
- |2
                      It is also recognized that the faculty has primary re- sponsibility with respect to academic appointments,
- |2
                      reappointments, decisions not to reappoint, promo-
- |2
                          tions, the granting of tenure, and dismissals. This re- sponsibility rests upon the fact that
- |2
                      scholars in a par- ticular field have the
- |2
                      chief competence for making judgments on all these matters of faculty
- |2
                      status.
- |2
                  Of course, administrative review and board approval are part of the
- |2
                      complicated procedures which are involved in making decisions on questions
- |2
                      of faculty status, but faculty judgment on these matters should
- |2
                      normally be decisive, and should not be overruled except for very
- |2
                      compelling reasons, and in accordance with procedures spelled out in
- |2
                      advance with explicit detail. In addition, it is agreed that the faculty
- |2
                      should be consulted in the selection of department chairmen,015
- |2
                       deans and presidents, and in the making of budget policy.
- |2
                      Finally, it is recognized that if faculty partici- pation is to be meaningful, the institution must
- |2
                      have suitable agencies for participation through regularly scheduled
- |2
                      faculty meetings, representative assemblies, and faculty committees, of
- |2
                      which at least the most important should be elected directly by the
- |2
                      faculty.
- |2
                  The tripartite Statement reflects a dramatic change
- |2
                      in the structure of American colleges and universities, for in the early
- |2
                      days of higher education in America the faculty was weak and the president
- |2
                      of the institu- tion was in a very
- |2
                      commanding position. The historic position of the American university
- |2
                      president was a powerful one from the very beginning, but changes have
- |2
                      occurred in the course of history, and this has resulted in significant
- |2
                      changes in the distribution of power within the institution. The basic
- |2
                      historic fact is that in the United States there were college presi- dents long before there were
- |2
                      professionally-trained, full-time, competent faculties completely
- |2
                      committed to the teaching profession. The earliest teachers in the
- |2
                      American colleges were mainly preachers who taught part-time, or who taught
- |2
                      occasionally as an alternative to other activities. In contrast, from the
- |2
                      very start the president was a full-time, fully-committed chief
- |2
                      officer of the institution. The colleges were weak, professional
- |2
                      faculties were unknown, and the only person who could speak for the
- |2
                      college, defend it against its enemies in the community, and secure the
- |2
                      necessary support, was the president. Thus, the president was strong
- |2
                      because the faculty was weak.
- |2
                  The conditions which created the powerful presi-
- |2
                      dent, however, disappeared with the rise of strong,
- |2
                      professionally-competent, full-time faculties, made up of scholars and
- |2
                      teachers, able to insist upon sharing with the institution's administration
- |2
                      the responsibility for making basic policy decisions. The growing involve- ment of American professors in the
- |2
                      governance of their institution is a consequence of their professional
- |2
                          com- petence. This is not to suggest that
- |2
                      presidents are unimportant or without power, but in the modern age the
- |2
                      professors have assumed the responsibility of exer-
- |2
                          cising a large portion of the innovative function in higher
- |2
                      education, for the president has become an extremely busy academic
- |2
                      entrepreneur who lacks the time and energy to be concerned very much or
- |2
                      very often with educational innovation.
- |2
                  The concept of a partnership between adminis-
- |2
                          tration, teaching faculty, and students now dominates the
- |2
                      American education scene. Professors do not regard themselves as mere
- |2
                      employees who can be hired and fired at will, and the theory and practice
- |2
                      of academic freedom, suitably buttressed by faculty participation in
- |2
                      the governance of the institution, has rendered
- |2
                       wholly untenable the conception of the professor as a hired
- |2
                      hand.
- |2
                  Finally, the modern concept of academic freedom insists that the professor
- |2
                      has a right to exercise all of the rights of citizenship, including freedom
- |2
                      of speech and freedom of association, and that in exercising these
- |2
                      rights he should be subjected to no institutional inter- ference or academic penalties. The 1940 Statement declares that the faculty member, as a
- |2
                      citizen, has the right to speak or write free from institutional censor- ship or discipline, though attention is
- |2
                      called to the professor's special obligation to be accurate, to
- |2
                      exercise appropriate restraint, to show respect for the opinion of
- |2
                      others, and to make every effort to indicate that he is not an
- |2
                      institutional spokesman. It is widely recog-
- |2
                      nized in the American academic community that a faculty member, like
- |2
                      other citizens, should be free to engage in political activities so far as
- |2
                      he can do so consistently with his professional obligations as a
- |2
                      teacher and scholar.

- |2
                  The main elements of academic freedom are securely established in those
- |2
                      countries which recognize and respect the principles of intellectual and
- |2
                      political free- dom. Academic freedom does not
- |2
                      exist in dictatorship countries, or in countries which practice thought- control. This suggests that while
- |2
                      academic freedom has its own special characteristics, it is invariably part
- |2
                      of a larger pattern of human freedom. Furthermore, just as the other
- |2
                      rights which modern man claims are sub- ject to
- |2
                      the manifold pressures of a complex, problem-
- |2
                          ridden, changing world, so does the right to academic freedom
- |2
                      encounter powerful pressures which weaken or challenge the concept, and
- |2
                      indeed, on some occa- sions and in some
- |2
                      places, threaten its very existence.
- |2
                  Some difficulties result, in the United States, from the very structure of
- |2
                      the system of higher education which is, in reality, no system at all.
- |2
                      There is no na- tional ministry of education,
- |2
                      and the role of the na- tional government in
- |2
                      education at all levels is largely limited to making and administering
- |2
                      financial grants. For the public institutions the power of control
- |2
                      rests in the fifty state governments, and in the governing boards
- |2
                      created by these governments. For the private institutions the power of
- |2
                      control rests in the boards of trustees. Some measure of conformity with
- |2
                      minimum general standards is achieved through the several re- gional accrediting associations, and through
- |2
                      the efforts of national professional associations in specialized
- |2
                      schools and colleges, such as those of law, medicine, pharmacy,
- |2
                      architecture, and journalism. But on the whole, variety and local control
- |2
                      are the central features of the American system of higher education. While the016
- |2
                       spirit of localism may serve to insulate problems, in- cluding violations of academic freedom, it
- |2
                      also encour- ages a chaotic tendency for the
- |2
                      locally autonomous institution to proceed on an ad
- |2
                      hoc basis free from the restraining influence of centralized standards
- |2
                      of per- formance. The still very
- |2
                      considerable administrative power of the typical American college or
- |2
                      university president, exercised locally in a self-defining sit- uation, gives a willful or determined man
- |2
                      great scope in which to operate with respect to his institution's
- |2
                      personnel.
- |2
                  In varying degrees throughout the world, the pro-
- |2
                          fessor's academic freedom is often under pressure from all sorts
- |2
                      of external forces—political parties and fac- tions, politicians, economic interests, religious
- |2
                      groups, patriotic organizations, racial and national origins groups,
- |2
                      and many others. In most institutions the influ-
- |2
                      ence of alumni and private donors is persistent and may be very
- |2
                      weighty. In many countries, and especially in the United States, there is a
- |2
                      wide-spread, latent anti-intellectualism in large segments of the
- |2
                      population which, under certain conditions, may contribute to the
- |2
                      outside pressures which challenge or weaken the aca-
- |2
                          demic freedom of the teachers. In a broader sense it may be
- |2
                      noted that, in the nature of their calling, pro-
- |2
                          fessors deal with new ideas, and it is often painful to work
- |2
                      with new ideas in areas where popular values are deeply entrenched.
- |2
                      Furthermore, the remarkable expansion of the social sciences in recent
- |2
                      years has had the result of involving professors more and more with
- |2
                      public issues on which large segments of the population are deeply divided.
- |2
                      Such issues as those involving war and peace, labor relations, regulation
- |2
                      of the economy, public ownership, and basic political change are
- |2
                      likely to be highly combustible.
- |2
                  During the period following World War II the out-
- |2
                          standing political fact on a global scale was the pro- tracted Cold War between the communist and
- |2
                          demo- cratic communities of nations,
- |2
                      particularly between the United States and the Soviet Union. The severe
- |2
                          pres- sures generated by the Cold War
- |2
                      exerted a profoundly disturbing impact upon educational institutions. In
- |2
                      the United States the Cold War led to the imposition of various forms
- |2
                      of loyalty oaths, which many professors regarded as invidiously insulting
- |2
                      to them, to legislative investigations, and sundry purges. In addition,
- |2
                      and again particularly in the United States, the post-World War II
- |2
                      period witnessed an agonizing conflict over race relations, and the
- |2
                      colleges and universities were deeply involved in situations growing out of
- |2
                      this conflict. In many institutions the freedom of professors to take
- |2
                      sides in this struggle was sharply challenged, and ad- ministrative reprisals were by no means unknown. Many
- |2
                      censure actions of the American Association of
- |2
                       University Professors, for example, were by-products of
- |2
                      tensions generated by the race issue.
- |2
                  Finally, all over the world, the decade of the 1960's was a time of serious
- |2
                      student dissatisfaction and unrest. In many places student dissent ripened
- |2
                      into disruption and violence, and led to stern measures on the part of
- |2
                      institutional administrations and governments. There were large-scale
- |2
                      police actions at such distinguished institutions as the University of
- |2
                      California in Berkeley and Columbia University in New York, and
- |2
                      massive military intervention against students in such cities as
- |2
                      Paris, Mexico City, and Tokyo. The academic freedom of the institution as a
- |2
                      whole was inevitably drawn into the maelstrom of issues which large-scale
- |2
                      student vio- lence created.
- |2
                  Like so many other freedoms, academic freedom is experienced unevenly in the
- |2
                      contemporary world. It is securely established in some countries, and
- |2
                      scarcely exists in others, and in between the extremes it exists in
- |2
                      varying degrees of amplitude and security. Where academic freedom is
- |2
                      well-defined and respected, the teaching profession understands that the
- |2
                      principle pro- tects the professor against the
- |2
                      devastating conse- quences of arbitrary
- |2
                      dismissal. It is recognized that the teacher can be dismissed only for
- |2
                      adequate cause, as established in a proceeding which measures up to
- |2
                      the requirements of due process, including a hearing before a tribunal
- |2
                      consisting of his academic peers. It is well understood that the security
- |2
                      of the professor depends not so much upon the substantive definition of
- |2
                      what constitutes adequate cause, as upon the procedures which are
- |2
                      followed. That proper procedure is an in-
- |2
                          dispensable element of justice in the life of the state is a
- |2
                      commonplace observation. Proper procedure is equally essential if academic
- |2
                      freedom is to remain a viable concept.

                      is claimed by teachers and other elements of the educa- tional community. While the claim to freedom of the
- |2
                      mind has a very long history—it was asserted in ancient Athens,
- |2
                      for example, by Socrates—academic freedom, as the more
- |2
                      specialized concern of the schools, is a rather modern phenomenon, having
- |2
                      been first recog- nized in some of the
- |2
                      universities of Western Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
- |2
                      Emerging in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the university in
- |2
                      the medieval age was to a considerable extent an autonomous corporate
- |2
                      institution, but the master or teacher was subject to powerful restraints,
- |2
                      both internal and external, and to the inhibiting force of authori- tative tradition. Beginning with
- |2
                      the founding of the university at Leiden in 1575, academic freedom beganWhile academic freedom has by no means achieved universal acceptance in the
- |2
                      contemporary world, it is accepted as the normal expectation in most

                      countries of Western Europe, with the exception of the dictator- ships on the Iberian peninsula. It

                      tries where academic freedom is understood and re- spected, however, there are two uses of the term
- |2
                      which, if not fundamentally different, seem to differ in their points
- |2
                      of emphasis. Thus, in Great Britain the term generally refers to the
- |2
                      freedom of the educational institution as a whole from outside influences,
- |2
                      political or otherwise.While this usage of the term is by no means unknown in the United States, in
- |2
                      America it almost invariably refers to the freedom of the individual
- |2
                      professor. Of course, outside influences are often brought to bear
- |2
                      upon American colleges and universities, and the con-
- |2
                          cept of academic freedom requires the institution to resist any
- |2
                      attacks upon its freedom to act as a corporate body. Nevertheless, in
- |2
                      accordance with the individ- ualistic
- |2
                      tendency of the concept of rights in American constitutional law, the claim
- |2
                      to academic freedom is generally stated and tested in terms of
- |2
                      individual teachers. Whatever may be the force of outside influ
- |2
                      ences, the concept holds that the institution has an obligation
- |2
                      to protect the rights of academic freedom for all of its faculty members.
- |2
                      Since the ultimate power of control over an American college or university
- |2
                      is vested in its governing board, a dismissal in violation of a
- |2
                      professor's academic freedom simply cannot hap-
- |2
                      pen unless the board decrees it. It follows that in the American
- |2
                      system of higher education, responsibility for protecting the academic
- |2
                      freedom of teachers rests with those who are legally in control of the
- |2
                      institution, and who have the power not only to condone violations of
- |2
                      that freedom, for example, by making improper dismissals, but also the
- |2
                      power to protect the faculty against outside pressures and to defend their
- |2
                      freedom. American experience indicates that even though a university
- |2
                      may enjoy complete institutional autonomy, so far as external pressures are
- |2
                      concerned, it is still possible for the university's administration to act
- |2
                      in a manner which is injurious to the faculty's claim to academic
- |2
                      freedom.Academic freedom is usually described as the right of each individual member
- |2
                      of the faculty of an institu- tion to enjoy
- |2
                      the freedom to study, to inquire, to speak his mind, to communicate his
- |2
                      ideas, and to assert the truth as he sees it. In the United States, the
- |2
                      professor's academic freedom is often defined in terms of full freedom
- |2
                      in research and in the publication of the results, in classroom discussion
- |2
                      of his subject, and in the exercise extra-murally of his basic rights as a
- |2
                          citi- zen. But in America, and increasingly
- |2
                      in other parts of the world, the concept of academic freedom has been
- |2
                      broadened to include students as well as teachers. The freedom of the
- |2
                      professor to teach is merely one side of the coin of academic freedom, the
- |2
                      other side being the freedom of the student to learn.In the historical sense this concept is neither very novel nor particularly
- |2
                      American. It was a familiar point in the great days of German higher
- |2
                      education, during the half century preceding World War I, that a close
- |2
                      affinity between Lehrfreiheit and Lernfreiheit was rec- ognized,
- |2
                      though for the student the freedom to learn assumed characteristics not
- |2
                      generally to be found in other countries. Once he had received the abitur (an examination taken at age 19 or 20, at the
- |2
                      end of thegymnasium period), he was free to wander from school
- |2
                      to school, to attend classes as he chose, and to take examinations whenever
- |2
                      he felt prepared, and to try again if he failed. Otherwise he was never
- |2
                      given grades and the flunk-out for unsatisfactory scholarship was
- |2
                      unknown. This sort of student freedom was not widely practiced or
- |2
                      recognized in other countries.By the third quarter of the twentieth century, uni-The Statement points out that “freedom to teach
- |2
                      and freedom to learn are inseparable facets of academic
- |2
                      freedom.” It is noted that since “free inquiry and
- |2
                      free expression are indispensable to the attainment” of the
- |2
                      goals of academic institutions—which are: “the trans- mission of knowledge, the pursuit of
- |2
                      truth, the devel- opment of students, and
- |2
                      the general well-being of
- |2
                      society”—“students should be encouraged to
- |2
                      develop the capacity for critical judgment and to engage in a
- |2
                      sustained and independent search for truth.” To this end, the
- |2
                          Statement spells out the rights of students as
- |2
                      regards institutional admission policies, in the class- room, in respect to student records, student affairs,
- |2
                      and off-campus activities. In the area of student affairs, various
- |2
                      standards are stated with respect to freedom of association, freedom of
- |2
                      inquiry and expression, par- ticipation in
- |2
                      institutional government, and student publications. A detailed final
- |2
                      section seeks to delineate, with considerable particularity, procedural
- |2
                      standards in disciplinary proceedings, to the end that students may
- |2
                      enjoy a full measure of due process.The fundamental case for academic freedom has always been that while it
- |2
                      confers desired benefits upon the professors who enjoy it, it is defensible
- |2
                      mainly on the ground that the unhampered search for the truth is for
- |2
                      the benefit of society as a whole. A basic premiss is that final truth in
- |2
                      all branches of human knowledge has not yet been achieved, and that new
- |2
                      truths will emerge only as ideas clash with ideas in an unrestricted
- |2
                      marketplace of ideas. In the words of Cardinal New-
- |2
                      man (1872), a true university or college is a place “in
- |2
                       which the intellect may safely range and speculate, sure to
- |2
                      find its equal in some antagonistic activity, and its judge in the tribunal
- |2
                      of truth. It is a place where inquiry is pushed forward, and discoveries
- |2
                      verified and perfected, and rashness rendered innocuous, and error
- |2
                      exposed, by the collision of mind with mind, and knowledge with
- |2
                      knowledge” (“What is a University?,”Historical Sketches [1872], I, 16). Thus it has been
- |2
                      asserted that academic freedom exists “in order that society may
- |2
                      have the benefit of honest judgment and independent criticism which
- |2
                      otherwise might be with- held because of fear
- |2
                      of offending a dominant group or transient social attitude”
- |2
                      (Clark Byse and Louis Joughin, Tenure in American Higher
- |2
                          Education [1959], p. 4).The eminent scholars (including the distinguished historian of ideas, Arthur
- |2
                      O. Lovejoy) who founded the American Association of University Professors
- |2
                      in 1915 published a Declaration of Principles which
- |2
                      stated the rationale for academic freedom that has been generally
- |2
                      accepted by the American academic community. They pointed out that while
- |2
                      professors are the appointees of the university's trustees, they are not in
- |2
                      any proper sense the trustees' employees, just as federal judges are
- |2
                      appointed by the President without becoming, as a consequence, the Chief
- |2
                      Executive's employees. “For, once appointed,” they
- |2
                      declared, “the scholar has pro-
- |2
                          fessional functions to perform in which the appointing
- |2
                      authorities have neither competency nor moral right to
- |2
                      intervene.” And they added: “A university is a great
- |2
                      and indispensable organ of the higher life of a civilized community, in the
- |2
                      work of which the trustees hold an essential and highly honorable place,
- |2
                      but in which the faculties hold an independent place, with quite equal
- |2
                      responsibilities—and in relation to purely scientific and
- |2
                      educational questions, the primary responsibility.” Stressing
- |2
                      the nature of the academic calling, they wrote that “if
- |2
                      education is the cornerstone of the structure of society, and if progress
- |2
                      in scientific knowledge is essential to civilization, few things can be
- |2
                      more impor- tant than to enhance the dignity
- |2
                      of the scholar's pro- fession, with a view to
- |2
                      attracting to its ranks men of the highest ability, of sound learning, and
- |2
                      of strong and independent character.”A similar conception of the nature of academic freedom has, in recent years,
- |2
                      been adopted by the United States Supreme Court. Speaking for the
- |2
                      Court in 1957, Chief Justice Warren declared:The essentiality of freedom in the community of American
- |2
                              universities is almost self-evident. No one should underes- timate the vital role in a
- |2
                              democracy that is played by those who guide and train our youth. To
- |2
                              impose any strait jacket upon the intellectual leaders in our
- |2
                              colleges and universities would imperil the future of our Nation.
- |2
                              No field of education
- |2
                          (Sweezy v. New
- |2
                              Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 250).
- |2
                      Similarly, in a concurring opinion filed in this case, Justice Frankfurter
- |2
                      wrote:These pages need not be burdened with proof, based on the testimony
- |2
                              of a cloud of impressive witnesses, of the dependence of a free
- |2
                              society on free universities. This means the exclusion of
- |2
                              governmental intervention in the intellec-
- |2
                                  tual life of a university. It matters little whether
- |2
                              such intervention occurs avowedly or through action that in- evitably tends to check the ardor
- |2
                              and fearlessness of scholars, qualities at once so fragile and so
- |2
                              indispensable for fruitful academic labor
- |2
                          (ibid., 354 U.S. 262).
- |2
                      More recently, again speaking for the Supreme Court, Justice Brennan
- |2
                      observed:Our Nation is deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom,
- |2
                              which is of transcendent value to all of us and not merely to the
- |2
                              teachers concerned. That freedom is therefore a special concern of
- |2
                              the First Amendment, which does not tolerate laws that cast a pall
- |2
                              of orthodoxy over the classroom. “The vigilant
- |2
                              protection of constitutional freedom is nowhere more vital than in
- |2
                              the community of American schools.”... The classroom is
- |2
                              peculiarly the “marketplace of ideas.” The
- |2
                              Nation's future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure
- |2
                              to that robust ex- change of ideas
- |2
                              which discovers truth “out of a multitude of tongues,
- |2
                              [rather] than through any kind of authoritative
- |2
                              selection”
- |2
                          (Keyishian v. Board of
- |2
                                  Regents of New York, 385 U.S. 589, 603 [1967]).
- |2
                      Thus, by the late 1960's, the concept of academic freedom had been accepted
- |2
                      by the United States Su- preme Court as an
- |2
                      integral part of the civil liberties law of the country. This concept was
- |2
                      by then also regarded by the academic community as an essential
- |2
                      element of the American system of intellectual free-
- |2
                          dom. It was widely believed that the schools play an
- |2
                      indispensable role in the progress of civilization, that the colleges and
- |2
                      universities were the country's most important instruments for the
- |2
                      generation and testing of new ideas and the advancement of scientific knowl- edge, and for the training of new
- |2
                      leadership in govern- ment, in the
- |2
                      professions, and in the economy. Since leaders in a rapidly changing world
- |2
                      should not be slaves to routine, but must, on the contrary, be able to
- |2
                      take the initiative, handle new ideas, solve new problems, evaluate
- |2
                      evidence, think rationally, and act purpose-
- |2
                      fully, it was felt that only a free educational system
- |2
                       can produce such leadership. In a broader sense, it was widely
- |2
                      understood that in a fluid, open, democratic society, in which the legally
- |2
                      protected right to dissent inevitably creates an atmosphere of controversy,
- |2
                      the schools cannot insulate their students from controversy, since
- |2
                      this would leave them unprepared to take their rightful places in a society
- |2
                      in which controversy is a daily and indispensable condition. Furthermore,
- |2
                      a democratic, self-governing society cannot afford the risk of having
- |2
                      an ignorant and unenlightened citizenry. Self-government means that the
- |2
                      citizen must be able to govern himself, that is to say, to control his
- |2
                      emotions, to use his reason, and to be concerned with the public
- |2
                      interest. To this end the schools, functioning in an atmosphere of academic
- |2
                      freedom, make a weighty contribution. It follows that the freedom of
- |2
                      teachers to teach and of students to learn is essential to democ- racy, to progress, to the security of a
- |2
                      way of life com- mitted to the maximizing of
- |2
                      human freedom.The world over, wherever the principle of academic freedom has been
- |2
                      understood and respected, it has been closely tied to the concept of
- |2
                      tenure, since security of employment is an essential precondition for
- |2
                      the unhampered exercise of academic freedom. While there are
- |2
                      variations on the general theme, the concept of tenure which has taken root
- |2
                      in the United States comes to this: after a teacher has served on a
- |2
                      faculty for a limited, prescribed number of years in proba- tionary status, he acquires a
- |2
                      permanent position.The American Association of University Professors has sought, during the
- |2
                      past half century, to standardize the maximum duration of the probationary
- |2
                      period. The influential 1940 Statement of
- |2
                      Principles, which it nego- tiated with
- |2
                      the Association of American Colleges, and which has been endorsed by over
- |2
                      sixty learned societies since its adoption, prescribed that the maximum
- |2
                          dura- tion of the probationary period
- |2
                      should be seven years. That is to say, after a teacher has served on a
- |2
                      faculty for seven years in probationary status, the institution has an
- |2
                      obligation to make up its mind whether to let him go or keep him
- |2
                      permanently by granting him tenure. Tenure means that the teacher, having
- |2
                      been found adequate by the institution during the proba- tionary period, is now entitled to hold his position
- |2
                      until retirement. It is recognized, however, that the concept does not
- |2
                      mean that a tenured professor can never be dismissed under any conceivable
- |2
                      circumstances. On the contrary, it is agreed that the institution has a
- |2
                      right to dismiss a tenured professor, but only if there is adequate
- |2
                      cause for the dismissal, and only if adequate cause is established by
- |2
                      procedures which satisfy the rigorous demands of due process. In addition,
- |2
                      it isThe essence of the tenure concept, then, is the rec-
- |2
                          ognition of the right to serve until retirement, unless there is
- |2
                      an earlier dismissal for an adequate reason established through procedures
- |2
                      which measure up to the requirements of justice by assuring the
- |2
                      individual concerned the protection of due process. This means that
- |2
                      before the administration of an institution makes an unfavorable
- |2
                      recommendation to the governing board, the faculty member must be given a
- |2
                      statement of specific charges, served upon him long enough in advance
- |2
                      so that he has adequate time to prepare his defense. Following the service
- |2
                      of charges, he is entitled to be heard, in the first instance, by a faculty
- |2
                          commit- tee, preferably an elected
- |2
                      committee not directly con- trolled by the
- |2
                      administration. Due process also assures the individual all of the elements
- |2
                      of a fair hearing, such as the right to be heard in his own defense, the
- |2
                      right to counsel, the right to offer witnesses and to confront and
- |2
                      cross-examine witnesses who appear against him, and a right to a
- |2
                      stenographic record of all hearings. Due process also demands that findings
- |2
                      of fact and the ultimate decision should be based on the hearing rec- ord.In addition, the burden of proof to establish the existence of adequate
- |2
                      cause for a dismissal is on those who brought the charges, since the grant
- |2
                      of tenure establishes a presumption of competence comparable to the
- |2
                      presumption of innocence which defendants enjoy in criminal cases. If the
- |2
                      faculty hearing commit- tee decides in favor
- |2
                      of the involved faculty member, the normal expectation is that the charges
- |2
                      will be dropped. If the administration persists in bringing the
- |2
                      charges to the governing body for final action, then that body is expected
- |2
                      to give the individual a hearing embracing all of the basic elements of due
- |2
                      process. When a faculty committee has made a decision favora- ble to the individual, then an especially heavy
- |2
                      burden of proof rests upon those who persist in pressing the charges.Thus, the real protection for the tenured professor, so far as dismissal is
- |2
                      concerned, depends far more upon the procedures available to him, than upon
- |2
                      any sub- stantive definition of the term
- |2
                      academic freedom. Fur- thermore, while the
- |2
                      rules of academic due process seek to protect the professor against
- |2
                      injustice, they also protect the institution and its administration from
- |2
                          act- ing unjustly and making mistakes.
- |2
                      Speaking in the wider context of governmental action, Justice Jackson
- |2
                      urged that it should not be overlooked that “due proc
- |2
                      ess of law is not for the sole benefit of an accused. It is the
- |2
                      best insurance for the Government itself against those blunders which leave
- |2
                      lasting stains on a system of justice but which are bound to occur on
- |2
                      ex parte consideration” (Shaughnessy v.
- |2
                          United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206,
- |2
                      224-25 [1953], dissenting opinion). When a professor is dismissed
- |2
                      arbitrarily, without charges and a chance to be heard in a fair
- |2
                      proceeding, not only is the professor treated wrongly, but the institution
- |2
                      deprives itself of the benefits and guidance which would be secured by
- |2
                      following proper procedures. An arbitrary dismissal also prevents the
- |2
                      academic community from having confidence in the institution's course of
- |2
                      action, since there are bound to be doubts about the acceptability of
- |2
                      administrative decisions which were taken with faulty procedure. Due
- |2
                      process is regarded as vital for the academic commu-
- |2
                          nity, as it is in the general community, because it is society's
- |2
                      best assurance that the action was taken justly.In the United States there are a number of associa-
- |2
                          tions concerned with defining and defending the pro- fessor's claim to academic freedom, such
- |2
                      as the Ameri- can Civil Liberties Union,
- |2
                      various teachers' unions, the American Association for Higher Education (an
- |2
                      affiliate of the National Educational Association), and many other
- |2
                      groups. Since its establishment in 1915, however, the chief spokesman for
- |2
                      the academic freedom rights of teachers in the world of higher education
- |2
                      has been the American Association of University Professors. Over the
- |2
                      years the Association has spelled out the content of academic freedom, both
- |2
                      substantive and procedural, in numerous statements of principles and
- |2
                      has dealt with specific complaints submitted to it by aggrieved professors.
- |2
                      Complaints alleging improper dismissals are referred to the Association's
- |2
                      oldest and most influential committee, Committee A, on Aca- demic Freedom and Tenure. During the past half cen- tury the Committee, with the assistance of
- |2
                      professional staff in the central office in Washington, has dealt with
- |2
                      hundreds of cases, and has developed a large and so- phisticated body of interpretations and common law
- |2
                      principles which relate to various aspects of academic freedom.Once the General Secretary of the Association has concluded that there is a
- |2
                          prima facie case for believing that a
- |2
                      serious violation of an important principle of academic freedom and tenure
- |2
                      has occurred, he ap- points an investigating
- |2
                      committee of disinterested scholars. Following its investigation, the ad
- |2
                      hoc com- mittee reports to Committee A, which
- |2
                      then decides whether to accept the report, and whether it should be
- |2
                      published in the quarterly journal of the Association.There is every reason to believe that this weapon of the Association is very
- |2
                      effective, even though it does not go beyond the expression of moral
- |2
                      disapproval. Administrations on censure are removed from the list by
- |2
                      vote of the annual delegate meeting of the Associa-
- |2
                          tion on the recommendation of Committee A. This occurs when it
- |2
                      has been decided that the dereliction which led to the censure action has
- |2
                      been corrected. Generally this takes the form of changes in the institu- tion's rules and procedures, and
- |2
                      the award to the in- jured party of some sort of
- |2
                      redress.There are active associations of university teachers in the other
- |2
                      English-speaking countries, notably Great Britain, Canada, Australia, in
- |2
                      the Scandinavian coun- tries, and rather less
- |2
                      effective associations in most of the other countries of Western Europe. In
- |2
                      addition there is an International Association of University Pro- fessors and Lecturers, with a part-time
- |2
                          Secretary- General, but this is
- |2
                      essentially an association of auton- omous
- |2
                      national bodies, and is limited in activity to the holding of periodical
- |2
                      conferences and seminars.The concept of academic freedom embraces more than mere protection against
- |2
                      arbitrary dismissals, though the central purpose of tenure is to protect
- |2
                      the teacher against such dismissals. In fact, professors often have
- |2
                      occasion to complain about many other forms of mistreatment. The American
- |2
                      Association, for example, has received frequent complaints about denial of
- |2
                      salary increases, or the receipt of increases below the average, or
- |2
                      the assignment of inconvenient hours or unwelcome courses, and other forms
- |2
                      of unwanted action taking the form and having the purpose of harassment. If
- |2
                          profes- sors are to be free from external
- |2
                      restraints in their pursuit of the truth, they must be as free from harass- ment as they are from the crippling
- |2
                      pressure of the possibility of summary dismissal. The American Asso- ciation of University Professors has
- |2
                      always taken the position that the best security against most forms of
- |2
                       harassment is to be found within the machinery of the
- |2
                      institution itself. Thus, an essential element of the prevailing American
- |2
                      conception of academic freedom is the principle of maximum faculty
- |2
                      participation in the decision-making processes of the institution.
- |2
                      Through faculty meetings, faculty committees, and other devices of
- |2
                      communication, the faculty, it is believed, can achieve a responsible place
- |2
                      in the making of institutional decisions. For example, institutions
- |2
                      are encouraged to have faculty grievance committees, built into the
- |2
                      official organizational system of the institution, for the adjustment of
- |2
                      complaints.The whole concept of faculty involvement in insti-
- |2
                          tutional government took a giant step forward in 1966, when
- |2
                      three major groups in American higher educa-
- |2
                      tion, the American Council on Education, the Ameri- can Association of University Professors, and the As- sociation of Governing Boards of
- "                    Universities and Colleges, reached agreement on a joint Statement
  on Government of Colleges and Universities. This \n"
- |2
                          State- ment
- |2
                       recognizes that college or university government is the joint
- |2
                      responsibility of the various major elements of the academic community,
- |2
                      faculties, administrators, governing boards, and students, since, it is
- |2
                      noted, “the variety and complexity of the tasks performed by
- |2
                          insti- tutions of higher education
- |2
                      produce an inescapable interdependence” among them. Joint
- |2
                      efforts by all components of the institution are needed for effective
- |2
                      planning and communication, for budgeting, for the selection of the chief
- |2
                      academic officials, and for the optimum use of facilities. More
- |2
                      particularly, the tri- partite
- |2
                      Statement recognizes that the faculty has
- |2
                          “pri- mary
- |2
                      responsibility” with respect to curriculum, sub- ject matter and methods of instruction, research, and
- |2
                      those elements of student life which relate to the edu- cational process. The faculty determines the require- ments for the degrees offered in
- |2
                      courses, and decides when and how degree requirements have been met.
- |2
                      It is also recognized that the faculty has primary re- sponsibility with respect to academic appointments,
- |2
                      reappointments, decisions not to reappoint, promo-
- |2
                          tions, the granting of tenure, and dismissals. This re- sponsibility rests upon the fact that
- |2
                      scholars in a par- ticular field have the
- |2
                      chief competence for making judgments on all these matters of faculty
- |2
                      status.Of course, administrative review and board approval are part of the
- |2
                      complicated procedures which are involved in making decisions on questions
- |2
                      of faculty status, but faculty judgment on these matters should
- |2
                      normally be decisive, and should not be overruled except for very
- |2
                      compelling reasons, and in accordance with procedures spelled out in
- |2
                      advance with explicit detail. In addition, it is agreed that the faculty
- |2
                      should be consulted in the selection of department chairmen,The tripartite Statement reflects a dramatic change
- |2
                      in the structure of American colleges and universities, for in the early
- |2
                      days of higher education in America the faculty was weak and the president
- |2
                      of the institu- tion was in a very
- |2
                      commanding position. The historic position of the American university
- |2
                      president was a powerful one from the very beginning, but changes have
- |2
                      occurred in the course of history, and this has resulted in significant
- |2
                      changes in the distribution of power within the institution. The basic
- |2
                      historic fact is that in the United States there were college presi- dents long before there were
- |2
                      professionally-trained, full-time, competent faculties completely
- |2
                      committed to the teaching profession. The earliest teachers in the
- |2
                      American colleges were mainly preachers who taught part-time, or who taught
- |2
                      occasionally as an alternative to other activities. In contrast, from the
- |2
                      very start the president was a full-time, fully-committed chief
- |2
                      officer of the institution. The colleges were weak, professional
- |2
                      faculties were unknown, and the only person who could speak for the
- |2
                      college, defend it against its enemies in the community, and secure the
- |2
                      necessary support, was the president. Thus, the president was strong
- |2
                      because the faculty was weak.The conditions which created the powerful presi-
- |2
                      dent, however, disappeared with the rise of strong,
- |2
                      professionally-competent, full-time faculties, made up of scholars and
- |2
                      teachers, able to insist upon sharing with the institution's administration
- |2
                      the responsibility for making basic policy decisions. The growing involve- ment of American professors in the
- |2
                      governance of their institution is a consequence of their professional
- |2
                          com- petence. This is not to suggest that
- |2
                      presidents are unimportant or without power, but in the modern age the
- |2
                      professors have assumed the responsibility of exer-
- |2
                          cising a large portion of the innovative function in higher
- |2
                      education, for the president has become an extremely busy academic
- |2
                      entrepreneur who lacks the time and energy to be concerned very much or
- |2
                      very often with educational innovation.The concept of a partnership between adminis-
- |2
                          tration, teaching faculty, and students now dominates the
- |2
                      American education scene. Professors do not regard themselves as mere
- |2
                      employees who can be hired and fired at will, and the theory and practice
- |2
                      of academic freedom, suitably buttressed by faculty participation in
- |2
                      the governance of the institution, has rendered
- |2
                       wholly untenable the conception of the professor as a hired
- |2
                      hand.Finally, the modern concept of academic freedom insists that the professor
- |2
                      has a right to exercise all of the rights of citizenship, including freedom
- |2
                      of speech and freedom of association, and that in exercising these
- |2
                      rights he should be subjected to no institutional inter- ference or academic penalties. The 1940 Statement declares that the faculty member, as a
- |2
                      citizen, has the right to speak or write free from institutional censor- ship or discipline, though attention is
- |2
                      called to the professor's special obligation to be accurate, to
- |2
                      exercise appropriate restraint, to show respect for the opinion of
- |2
                      others, and to make every effort to indicate that he is not an
- |2
                      institutional spokesman. It is widely recog-
- |2
                      nized in the American academic community that a faculty member, like
- |2
                      other citizens, should be free to engage in political activities so far as
- |2
                      he can do so consistently with his professional obligations as a
- |2
                      teacher and scholar.The main elements of academic freedom are securely established in those
- |2
                      countries which recognize and respect the principles of intellectual and
- |2
                      political free- dom. Academic freedom does not
- |2
                      exist in dictatorship countries, or in countries which practice thought- control. This suggests that while
- |2
                      academic freedom has its own special characteristics, it is invariably part
- |2
                      of a larger pattern of human freedom. Furthermore, just as the other
- |2
                      rights which modern man claims are sub- ject to
- |2
                      the manifold pressures of a complex, problem-
- |2
                          ridden, changing world, so does the right to academic freedom
- |2
                      encounter powerful pressures which weaken or challenge the concept, and
- |2
                      indeed, on some occa- sions and in some
- |2
                      places, threaten its very existence.Some difficulties result, in the United States, from the very structure of
- |2
                      the system of higher education which is, in reality, no system at all.
- |2
                      There is no na- tional ministry of education,
- |2
                      and the role of the na- tional government in
- |2
                      education at all levels is largely limited to making and administering
- |2
                      financial grants. For the public institutions the power of control
- |2
                      rests in the fifty state governments, and in the governing boards
- |2
                      created by these governments. For the private institutions the power of
- |2
                      control rests in the boards of trustees. Some measure of conformity with
- |2
                      minimum general standards is achieved through the several re- gional accrediting associations, and through
- |2
                      the efforts of national professional associations in specialized
- |2
                      schools and colleges, such as those of law, medicine, pharmacy,
- |2
                      architecture, and journalism. But on the whole, variety and local control
- |2
                      are the central features of the American system of higher education. While theIn varying degrees throughout the world, the pro-
- |2
                          fessor's academic freedom is often under pressure from all sorts
- |2
                      of external forces—political parties and fac- tions, politicians, economic interests, religious
- |2
                      groups, patriotic organizations, racial and national origins groups,
- |2
                      and many others. In most institutions the influ-
- |2
                      ence of alumni and private donors is persistent and may be very
- |2
                      weighty. In many countries, and especially in the United States, there is a
- |2
                      wide-spread, latent anti-intellectualism in large segments of the
- |2
                      population which, under certain conditions, may contribute to the
- |2
                      outside pressures which challenge or weaken the aca-
- |2
                          demic freedom of the teachers. In a broader sense it may be
- |2
                      noted that, in the nature of their calling, pro-
- |2
                          fessors deal with new ideas, and it is often painful to work
- |2
                      with new ideas in areas where popular values are deeply entrenched.
- |2
                      Furthermore, the remarkable expansion of the social sciences in recent
- |2
                      years has had the result of involving professors more and more with
- |2
                      public issues on which large segments of the population are deeply divided.
- |2
                      Such issues as those involving war and peace, labor relations, regulation
- |2
                      of the economy, public ownership, and basic political change are
- |2
                      likely to be highly combustible.During the period following World War II the out-
- |2
                          standing political fact on a global scale was the pro- tracted Cold War between the communist and
- |2
                          demo- cratic communities of nations,
- |2
                      particularly between the United States and the Soviet Union. The severe
- |2
                          pres- sures generated by the Cold War
- |2
                      exerted a profoundly disturbing impact upon educational institutions. In
- |2
                      the United States the Cold War led to the imposition of various forms
- |2
                      of loyalty oaths, which many professors regarded as invidiously insulting
- |2
                      to them, to legislative investigations, and sundry purges. In addition,
- |2
                      and again particularly in the United States, the post-World War II
- |2
                      period witnessed an agonizing conflict over race relations, and the
- |2
                      colleges and universities were deeply involved in situations growing out of
- |2
                      this conflict. In many institutions the freedom of professors to take
- |2
                      sides in this struggle was sharply challenged, and ad- ministrative reprisals were by no means unknown. Many
- |2
                      censure actions of the American Association of
- |2
                       University Professors, for example, were by-products of
- |2
                      tensions generated by the race issue.Finally, all over the world, the decade of the 1960's was a time of serious
- |2
                      student dissatisfaction and unrest. In many places student dissent ripened
- |2
                      into disruption and violence, and led to stern measures on the part of
- |2
                      institutional administrations and governments. There were large-scale
- |2
                      police actions at such distinguished institutions as the University of
- |2
                      California in Berkeley and Columbia University in New York, and
- |2
                      massive military intervention against students in such cities as
- |2
                      Paris, Mexico City, and Tokyo. The academic freedom of the institution as a
- |2
                      whole was inevitably drawn into the maelstrom of issues which large-scale
- |2
                      student vio- lence created.Like so many other freedoms, academic freedom is experienced unevenly in the
- |2
                      contemporary world. It is securely established in some countries, and
- |2
                      scarcely exists in others, and in between the extremes it exists in
- |2
                      varying degrees of amplitude and security. Where academic freedom is
- |2
                      well-defined and respected, the teaching profession understands that the
- |2
                      principle pro- tects the professor against the
- |2
                      devastating conse- quences of arbitrary
- |2
                      dismissal. It is recognized that the teacher can be dismissed only for
- |2
                      adequate cause, as established in a proceeding which measures up to
- |2
                      the requirements of due process, including a hearing before a tribunal
- |2
                      consisting of his academic peers. It is well understood that the security
- |2
                      of the professor depends not so much upon the substantive definition of
- |2
                      what constitutes adequate cause, as upon the procedures which are
- |2
                      followed. That proper procedure is an in-
- |2
                          dispensable element of justice in the life of the state is a
- |2
                      commonplace observation. Proper procedure is equally essential if academic
- |2
                      freedom is to remain a viable concept.The leading history of academic freedom, with special reference to the
- |2
                          United States, is Richard Hofstadter and Walter P. Metzger, The Development of Academic Freedom in the United

- |2
                          concept in American higher education is by Clark Byse and Louis
- |2
                          Joughin, Tenure in American Higher Education
- |2
                          (Ithaca, N.Y., 1959). Louis Joughin, ed., Academic
- |2
                              Freedom and Tenure (Madison, 1967), contains most of the basic
- |2
                          statements of principles adopted by the American Association of
- |2
                          University Professors, as well as six important journal articles on the
- |2
                          subject of academic freedom and tenure. Policy statements of the
- |2
                          American Civil Liberties Union on academic freedom and due process are
- |2
                          reprinted in the American Association of University Professors, Bul- letin,

  \               ACADEMIC FREEDOM\n                I\n                    \n             \n
  \               Academic freedom is the liberty of thought which\n                    is
  claimed by teachers and other elements of the educa- tional community. While the
  claim to freedom of the\n                    mind has a very long history—it was
  asserted in ancient Athens,\n                    for example, by Socrates—academic
  freedom, as the more\n                    specialized concern of the schools, is
  a rather modern phenomenon, having\n                    been first recog- nized
  in some of the\n                    universities of Western Europe in the sixteenth
  and seventeenth centuries.\n                    Emerging in the twelfth and thirteenth
  centuries, the university in\n                    the medieval age was to a considerable
  extent an autonomous corporate\n                    institution, but the master
  or teacher was subject to powerful restraints,\n                    both internal
  and external, and to the inhibiting force of authori- tative tradition. Beginning
  with\n                    the founding of the university at Leiden in 1575, academic
  freedom began010\n                     to take root in the Western world, albeit
  very slowly, as a\n                    consequence of the gradual development of
  an atmosphere of tolerance\n                    nurtured by the rise of reli- gious,\n
  \                   political, and economic liberalism, and the growth of the so-called
  new\n                    sciences. Francis Bacon'sAdvancement of Learning (1605)
  proclaimed the phil- osophical underpinning of the case for\n                    freedom
  of experimental inquiry with respect to the new sciences. The\n                    fierce,
  destructive, sectarian religious and political conflicts which\n                    characterized
  the struggle between the Reformation and the\n                    Counter-Reformation
  led a deci- mated and\n                    exhausted Western Europe to comprehend
  the values of toleration. The steady\n                    growth of com- merce,
  which, among other\n                    things, drew attention to the desirable
  consequences of competitive\n                    enterprise, together with the rise
  of the liberal state, led to the\n                    emergence of a philosophy
  of knowledge which stressed the basic contingency\n                    of ideas,
  and the utility of testing the value of ideas, not in terms of\n                    the
  power of those who espoused them, but rather in terms of their\n                    capacity
  to stand up under the competition of other ideas. There was a\n                    logical
  transition from the competition of the marketplace to the\n                    competition
  of ideas.\n                While academic freedom has by no means achieved universal
  acceptance in the\n                    contemporary world, it is accepted as the
  normal expectation in most\n                    countries of Western Europe, with
  the exception of the dictator- ships on the Iberian peninsula. It\n                    is
  not accepted by the communist or communist-dominated countries in\n                    Central
  and Eastern Europe and in Asia. It is significant that academic\n                    freedom
  is regarded, at least in princi- ple,\n                    as a necessary and desirable
  aspect of higher edu-\n                        cation in many of the developing
  countries of Africa, the Middle\n                    East, and the Far East. In
  the many coun-\n                    tries where academic freedom is understood and
  re- spected, however, there are two uses of the term\n                    which,
  if not fundamentally different, seem to differ in their points\n                    of
  emphasis. Thus, in Great Britain the term generally refers to the\n                    freedom
  of the educational institution as a whole from outside influences,\n                    political
  or otherwise.\n                While this usage of the term is by no means unknown
  in the United States, in\n                    America it almost invariably refers
  to the freedom of the individual\n                    professor. Of course, outside
  influences are often brought to bear\n                    upon American colleges
  and universities, and the con-\n                        cept of academic freedom
  requires the institution to resist any\n                    attacks upon its freedom
  to act as a corporate body. Nevertheless, in\n                    accordance with
  the individ- ualistic\n                    tendency of the concept of rights in
  American constitutional law, the claim\n                    to academic freedom
  is generally stated and tested in terms of\n                    individual teachers.
  Whatever may be the force of outside influ\n                    ences, the concept
  holds that the institution has an obligation\n                    to protect the
  rights of academic freedom for all of its faculty members.\n                    Since
  the ultimate power of control over an American college or university\n                    is
  vested in its governing board, a dismissal in violation of a\n                    professor's
  academic freedom simply cannot hap-\n                    pen unless the board decrees
  it. It follows that in the American\n                    system of higher education,
  responsibility for protecting the academic\n                    freedom of teachers
  rests with those who are legally in control of the\n                    institution,
  and who have the power not only to condone violations of\n                    that
  freedom, for example, by making improper dismissals, but also the\n                    power
  to protect the faculty against outside pressures and to defend their\n                    freedom.
  American experience indicates that even though a university\n                    may
  enjoy complete institutional autonomy, so far as external pressures are\n                    concerned,
  it is still possible for the university's administration to act\n                    in
  a manner which is injurious to the faculty's claim to academic\n                    freedom.\n
  \               \n                        II\n                    \n                \n
  \               Academic freedom is usually described as the right of each individual
  member\n                    of the faculty of an institu- tion to enjoy\n                    the
  freedom to study, to inquire, to speak his mind, to communicate his\n                    ideas,
  and to assert the truth as he sees it. In the United States, the\n                    professor's
  academic freedom is often defined in terms of full freedom\n                    in
  research and in the publication of the results, in classroom discussion\n                    of
  his subject, and in the exercise extra-murally of his basic rights as a\n                        citi-
  zen. But in America, and increasingly\n                    in other parts of the
  world, the concept of academic freedom has been\n                    broadened to
  include students as well as teachers. The freedom of the\n                    professor
  to teach is merely one side of the coin of academic freedom, the\n                    other
  side being the freedom of the student to learn.\n                In the historical
  sense this concept is neither very novel nor particularly\n                    American.
  It was a familiar point in the great days of German higher\n                    education,
  during the half century preceding World War I, that a close\n                    affinity
  between Lehrfreiheit and Lernfreiheit was rec- ognized,\n                    though
  for the student the freedom to learn assumed characteristics not\n                    generally
  to be found in other countries. Once he had received the abitur (an examination
  taken at age 19 or 20, at the\n                    end of thegymnasium period),
  he was free to wander from school\n                    to school, to attend classes
  as he chose, and to take examinations whenever\n                    he felt prepared,
  and to try again if he failed. Otherwise he was never\n                    given
  grades and the flunk-out for unsatisfactory scholarship was\n                    unknown.
  This sort of student freedom was not widely practiced or\n                    recognized
  in other countries.\n                By the third quarter of the twentieth century,
  uni-011\n                    \n                    versity students in the United
  States, and indeed all other\n                    elements of the university community,
  became more and more interested in\n                    those aspects of academic
  freedom which are of immediate concern to\n                    students. Various
  student associations began to draft statements of\n                    specific
  rights which they thought they were entitled to claim as against\n                    interference
  by college and univer- sity\n                    authorities. Civil liberties organizations
  and pro- fessorial groups also became active in this effort to\n                    spell
  out the academic freedom rights of the students. This activity\n                    produced,
  in 1967, a Joint Statement on Rights and\n                        Freedoms of Students,
  drafted by a joint committee made up of\n                    representatives of
  the American Associa-\n                    tion of University Professors, the U.
  S. National Student\n                    Association, the Association of American
  Colleges, the National Association\n                    of Student Personnel Adminis-
  trators,\n                    and the National Association of Women Deans and Counselors.
  Other\n                    educational associations have endorsed the Statement\n
  \                   since its formulation, and thus it is rapidly acquiring standing
  as an\n                    authoritative statement of desirable normative principles.\n
  \               The Statement points out that “freedom to teach\n                    and
  freedom to learn are inseparable facets of academic\n                    freedom.”
  It is noted that since “free inquiry and\n                    free expression are
  indispensable to the attainment” of the\n                    goals of academic institutions—which
  are: “the trans- mission of knowledge, the pursuit of\n                    truth,
  the devel- opment of students, and\n                    the general well-being of\n
  \                   society”—“students should be encouraged to\n                    develop
  the capacity for critical judgment and to engage in a\n                    sustained
  and independent search for truth.” To this end, the\n                        Statement
  spells out the rights of students as\n                    regards institutional
  admission policies, in the class- room, in respect to student records, student affairs,\n
  \                   and off-campus activities. In the area of student affairs, various\n
  \                   standards are stated with respect to freedom of association,
  freedom of\n                    inquiry and expression, par- ticipation in\n                    institutional
  government, and student publications. A detailed final\n                    section
  seeks to delineate, with considerable particularity, procedural\n                    standards
  in disciplinary proceedings, to the end that students may\n                    enjoy
  a full measure of due process.\n                \n                        III\n
  \               \n                The fundamental case for academic freedom has
  always been that while it\n                    confers desired benefits upon the
  professors who enjoy it, it is defensible\n                    mainly on the ground
  that the unhampered search for the truth is for\n                    the benefit
  of society as a whole. A basic premiss is that final truth in\n                    all
  branches of human knowledge has not yet been achieved, and that new\n                    truths
  will emerge only as ideas clash with ideas in an unrestricted\n                    marketplace
  of ideas. In the words of Cardinal New-\n                    man (1872), a true
  university or college is a place “in\n                     which the intellect may
  safely range and speculate, sure to\n                    find its equal in some
  antagonistic activity, and its judge in the tribunal\n                    of truth.
  It is a place where inquiry is pushed forward, and discoveries\n                    verified
  and perfected, and rashness rendered innocuous, and error\n                    exposed,
  by the collision of mind with mind, and knowledge with\n                    knowledge”
  (“What is a University?,”Historical Sketches [1872], I, 16). Thus it has been\n
  \                   asserted that academic freedom exists “in order that society
  may\n                    have the benefit of honest judgment and independent criticism
  which\n                    otherwise might be with- held because of fear\n                    of
  offending a dominant group or transient social attitude”\n                    (Clark
  Byse and Louis Joughin, Tenure in American Higher\n                        Education
  [1959], p. 4).\n                The eminent scholars (including the distinguished
  historian of ideas, Arthur\n                    O. Lovejoy) who founded the American
  Association of University Professors\n                    in 1915 published a Declaration
  of Principles which\n                    stated the rationale for academic freedom
  that has been generally\n                    accepted by the American academic community.
  They pointed out that while\n                    professors are the appointees of
  the university's trustees, they are not in\n                    any proper sense
  the trustees' employees, just as federal judges are\n                    appointed
  by the President without becoming, as a consequence, the Chief\n                    Executive's
  employees. “For, once appointed,” they\n                    declared, “the scholar
  has pro-\n                        fessional functions to perform in which the appointing\n
  \                   authorities have neither competency nor moral right to\n                    intervene.”
  And they added: “A university is a great\n                    and indispensable
  organ of the higher life of a civilized community, in the\n                    work
  of which the trustees hold an essential and highly honorable place,\n                    but
  in which the faculties hold an independent place, with quite equal\n                    responsibilities—and
  in relation to purely scientific and\n                    educational questions,
  the primary responsibility.” Stressing\n                    the nature of the academic
  calling, they wrote that “if\n                    education is the cornerstone of
  the structure of society, and if progress\n                    in scientific knowledge
  is essential to civilization, few things can be\n                    more impor-
  tant than to enhance the dignity\n                    of the scholar's pro- fession,
  with a view to\n                    attracting to its ranks men of the highest ability,
  of sound learning, and\n                    of strong and independent character.”\n
  \               A similar conception of the nature of academic freedom has, in recent
  years,\n                    been adopted by the United States Supreme Court. Speaking
  for the\n                    Court in 1957, Chief Justice Warren declared:\n                \n
  \                   \n                        The essentiality of freedom in the
  community of American\n                            universities is almost self-evident.
  No one should underes- timate the vital role in a\n                            democracy
  that is played by those who guide and train our youth. To\n                            impose
  any strait jacket upon the intellectual leaders in our\n                            colleges
  and universities would imperil the future of our Nation.\n                            No
  field of education012\n                             is so thoroughly comprehended
  by man that new\n                            discoveries cannot yet be made. Particularly
  is that true in the\n                            social sciences, where few, if
  any, principles are accepted as\n                            absolutes. Scholarship
  cannot flourish in an atmosphere of\n                            suspicion and distrust.
  Teachers and students must always remain\n                            free to inquire,
  to study and to evaluate, to gain new maturity and\n                            understanding;
  otherwise our civilization will stagnate and die\n                    \n                    \n

  U.S. 234, 250).\n                    \n                \n                Similarly,
  in a concurring opinion filed in this case, Justice Frankfurter\n                    wrote:\n
  \               \n                    \n                        These pages need
  not be burdened with proof, based on the testimony\n                            of
  a cloud of impressive witnesses, of the dependence of a free\n                            society
  on free universities. This means the exclusion of\n                            governmental
  intervention in the intellec-\n                                tual life of a university.
  It matters little whether\n                            such intervention occurs
  avowedly or through action that in- evitably tends to check the ardor\n                            and
  fearlessness of scholars, qualities at once so fragile and so\n                            indispensable
  for fruitful academic labor\n                    \n                    \n                        (ibid.,
  354 U.S. 262).\n                    \n                \n                More recently,
  again speaking for the Supreme Court, Justice Brennan\n                    observed:\n
  \               \n                    \n                        Our Nation is deeply
  committed to safeguarding academic freedom,\n                            which is
  of transcendent value to all of us and not merely to the\n                            teachers
  concerned. That freedom is therefore a special concern of\n                            the
  First Amendment, which does not tolerate laws that cast a pall\n                            of
  orthodoxy over the classroom. “The vigilant\n                            protection
  of constitutional freedom is nowhere more vital than in\n                            the
  community of American schools.”... The classroom is\n                            peculiarly
  the “marketplace of ideas.” The\n                            Nation's future depends
  upon leaders trained through wide exposure\n                            to that
  robust ex- change of ideas\n                            which discovers truth “out
  of a multitude of tongues,\n                            [rather] than through any
  kind of authoritative\n                            selection”\n                    \n
  \                   \n                        (Keyishian v. Board of\n                                Regents
  of New York, 385 U.S. 589, 603 [1967]).\n                    \n                \n
  \               Thus, by the late 1960's, the concept of academic freedom had been
  accepted\n                    by the United States Su- preme Court as an\n                    integral
  part of the civil liberties law of the country. This concept was\n                    by
  then also regarded by the academic community as an essential\n                    element
  of the American system of intellectual free-\n                        dom. It was
  widely believed that the schools play an\n                    indispensable role
  in the progress of civilization, that the colleges and\n                    universities
  were the country's most important instruments for the\n                    generation
  and testing of new ideas and the advancement of scientific knowl- edge, and for
  the training of new\n                    leadership in govern- ment, in the\n                    professions,
  and in the economy. Since leaders in a rapidly changing world\n                    should
  not be slaves to routine, but must, on the contrary, be able to\n                    take
  the initiative, handle new ideas, solve new problems, evaluate\n                    evidence,
  think rationally, and act purpose-\n                    fully, it was felt that
  only a free educational system\n                     can produce such leadership.
  In a broader sense, it was widely\n                    understood that in a fluid,
  open, democratic society, in which the legally\n                    protected right
  to dissent inevitably creates an atmosphere of controversy,\n                    the
  schools cannot insulate their students from controversy, since\n                    this
  would leave them unprepared to take their rightful places in a society\n                    in
  which controversy is a daily and indispensable condition. Furthermore,\n                    a
  democratic, self-governing society cannot afford the risk of having\n                    an
  ignorant and unenlightened citizenry. Self-government means that the\n                    citizen
  must be able to govern himself, that is to say, to control his\n                    emotions,
  to use his reason, and to be concerned with the public\n                    interest.
  To this end the schools, functioning in an atmosphere of academic\n                    freedom,
  make a weighty contribution. It follows that the freedom of\n                    teachers
  to teach and of students to learn is essential to democ- racy, to progress, to the
  security of a\n                    way of life com- mitted to the maximizing of\n
  \                   human freedom.\n                \n                    IV\n         \n
  \               The world over, wherever the principle of academic freedom has been\n
  \                   understood and respected, it has been closely tied to the concept
  of\n                    tenure, since security of employment is an essential precondition
  for\n                    the unhampered exercise of academic freedom. While there
  are\n                    variations on the general theme, the concept of tenure
  which has taken root\n                    in the United States comes to this: after
  a teacher has served on a\n                    faculty for a limited, prescribed
  number of years in proba- tionary status, he acquires a\n                    permanent
  position.\n                The American Association of University Professors has
  sought, during the\n                    past half century, to standardize the maximum
  duration of the probationary\n                    period. The influential 1940 Statement
  of\n                    Principles, which it nego- tiated with\n                    the
  Association of American Colleges, and which has been endorsed by over\n                    sixty
  learned societies since its adoption, prescribed that the maximum\n                        dura-
  tion of the probationary period\n                    should be seven years. That
  is to say, after a teacher has served on a\n                    faculty for seven
  years in probationary status, the institution has an\n                    obligation
  to make up its mind whether to let him go or keep him\n                    permanently
  by granting him tenure. Tenure means that the teacher, having\n                    been
  found adequate by the institution during the proba- tionary period, is now entitled
  to hold his position\n                    until retirement. It is recognized, however,
  that the concept does not\n                    mean that a tenured professor can
  never be dismissed under any conceivable\n                    circumstances. On
  the contrary, it is agreed that the institution has a\n                    right
  to dismiss a tenured professor, but only if there is adequate\n                    cause
  for the dismissal, and only if adequate cause is established by\n                    procedures
  which satisfy the rigorous demands of due process. In addition,\n                    it
  is013\n                     recognized that an institution may find it necessary
  to\n                    terminate a continuous appointment because of finan-\n                        cial
  exigency—though it is insisted, in the 1940 State- ment, that such\n                    financial
  exigency “should be demon-\n                        strably bona fide.”\n                The
  essence of the tenure concept, then, is the rec-\n                        ognition
  of the right to serve until retirement, unless there is\n                    an
  earlier dismissal for an adequate reason established through procedures\n                    which
  measure up to the requirements of justice by assuring the\n                    individual
  concerned the protection of due process. This means that\n                    before
  the administration of an institution makes an unfavorable\n                    recommendation
  to the governing board, the faculty member must be given a\n                    statement
  of specific charges, served upon him long enough in advance\n                    so
  that he has adequate time to prepare his defense. Following the service\n                    of
  charges, he is entitled to be heard, in the first instance, by a faculty\n                        commit-
  tee, preferably an elected\n                    committee not directly con- trolled
  by the\n                    administration. Due process also assures the individual
  all of the elements\n                    of a fair hearing, such as the right to
  be heard in his own defense, the\n                    right to counsel, the right
  to offer witnesses and to confront and\n                    cross-examine witnesses
  who appear against him, and a right to a\n                    stenographic record
  of all hearings. Due process also demands that findings\n                    of
  fact and the ultimate decision should be based on the hearing rec- ord.\n                In
  addition, the burden of proof to establish the existence of adequate\n                    cause
  for a dismissal is on those who brought the charges, since the grant\n                    of
  tenure establishes a presumption of competence comparable to the\n                    presumption
  of innocence which defendants enjoy in criminal cases. If the\n                    faculty
  hearing commit- tee decides in favor\n                    of the involved faculty
  member, the normal expectation is that the charges\n                    will be
  dropped. If the administration persists in bringing the\n                    charges
  to the governing body for final action, then that body is expected\n                    to
  give the individual a hearing embracing all of the basic elements of due\n                    process.
  When a faculty committee has made a decision favora- ble to the individual, then
  an especially heavy\n                    burden of proof rests upon those who persist
  in pressing the charges.\n                Thus, the real protection for the tenured
  professor, so far as dismissal is\n                    concerned, depends far more
  upon the procedures available to him, than upon\n                    any sub- stantive
  definition of the term\n                    academic freedom. Fur- thermore, while
  the\n                    rules of academic due process seek to protect the professor
  against\n                    injustice, they also protect the institution and its
  administration from\n                        act- ing unjustly and making mistakes.\n
  \                   Speaking in the wider context of governmental action, Justice
  Jackson\n                    urged that it should not be overlooked that “due proc\n
  \                   ess of law is not for the sole benefit of an accused. It is
  the\n                    best insurance for the Government itself against those
  blunders which leave\n                    lasting stains on a system of justice
  but which are bound to occur on\n                    ex parte consideration” (Shaughnessy
  v.\n                        United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206,\n                    224-25
  [1953], dissenting opinion). When a professor is dismissed\n                    arbitrarily,
  without charges and a chance to be heard in a fair\n                    proceeding,
  not only is the professor treated wrongly, but the institution\n                    deprives
  itself of the benefits and guidance which would be secured by\n                    following
  proper procedures. An arbitrary dismissal also prevents the\n                    academic
  community from having confidence in the institution's course of\n                    action,
  since there are bound to be doubts about the acceptability of\n                    administrative
  decisions which were taken with faulty procedure. Due\n                    process
  is regarded as vital for the academic commu-\n                        nity, as it
  is in the general community, because it is society's\n                    best assurance
  that the action was taken justly.\n                \n                    \n                        V\n
  \                 \n                In the United States there are a number of associa-\n
  \                       tions concerned with defining and defending the pro- fessor's
  claim to academic freedom, such\n                    as the Ameri- can Civil Liberties
  Union,\n                    various teachers' unions, the American Association for
  Higher Education (an\n                    affiliate of the National Educational
  Association), and many other\n                    groups. Since its establishment
  in 1915, however, the chief spokesman for\n                    the academic freedom
  rights of teachers in the world of higher education\n                    has been
  the American Association of University Professors. Over the\n                    years
  the Association has spelled out the content of academic freedom, both\n                    substantive
  and procedural, in numerous statements of principles and\n                    has
  dealt with specific complaints submitted to it by aggrieved professors.\n                    Complaints
  alleging improper dismissals are referred to the Association's\n                    oldest
  and most influential committee, Committee A, on Aca- demic Freedom and Tenure. During
  the past half cen- tury the Committee, with the assistance of\n                    professional
  staff in the central office in Washington, has dealt with\n                    hundreds
  of cases, and has developed a large and so- phisticated body of interpretations
  and common law\n                    principles which relate to various aspects of
  academic freedom.\n                Once the General Secretary of the Association
  has concluded that there is a\n                        prima facie case for believing
  that a\n                    serious violation of an important principle of academic
  freedom and tenure\n                    has occurred, he ap- points an investigating\n
  \                   committee of disinterested scholars. Following its investigation,
  the ad\n                    hoc com- mittee reports to Committee A, which\n                    then
  decides whether to accept the report, and whether it should be\n                    published
  in the quarterly journal of the Association.014\n                     Once a year,
  at the annual delegate meeting of the Association,\n                    Committee
  A decides whether to recom- mend for\n                    or against censure of
  the administration con-\n                    cerned. The ultimate weapon of the
  Association is a public censure,\n                    which is no more, and no less,
  than an expression of moral disapproval.\n                    Through the in- strumentality
  of censure\n                    the Association pronounces its special form of anathema
  upon the\n                    administration of an institution, declaring that in
  its informed and\n                    solemn judgment, proper conditions of academic
  free-\n                        dom do not exist there. This is communicated to the
  academic\n                    world through the Association's publications, through
  the mass media, and\n                    through the efforts of other learned societies.\n
  \               There is every reason to believe that this weapon of the Association
  is very\n                    effective, even though it does not go beyond the expression
  of moral\n                    disapproval. Administrations on censure are removed
  from the list by\n                    vote of the annual delegate meeting of the
  Associa-\n                        tion on the recommendation of Committee A. This
  occurs when it\n                    has been decided that the dereliction which
  led to the censure action has\n                    been corrected. Generally this
  takes the form of changes in the institu- tion's rules and procedures, and\n                    the
  award to the in- jured party of some sort of\n                    redress.\n                There
  are active associations of university teachers in the other\n                    English-speaking
  countries, notably Great Britain, Canada, Australia, in\n                    the
  Scandinavian coun- tries, and rather less\n                    effective associations
  in most of the other countries of Western Europe. In\n                    addition
  there is an International Association of University Pro- fessors and Lecturers,
  with a part-time\n                        Secretary- General, but this is\n                    essentially
  an association of auton- omous\n                    national bodies, and is limited
  in activity to the holding of periodical\n                    conferences and seminars.\n
  \               \n                    \n                        VI\n                 \n
  \               The concept of academic freedom embraces more than mere protection
  against\n                    arbitrary dismissals, though the central purpose of
  tenure is to protect\n                    the teacher against such dismissals. In
  fact, professors often have\n                    occasion to complain about many
  other forms of mistreatment. The American\n                    Association, for
  example, has received frequent complaints about denial of\n                    salary
  increases, or the receipt of increases below the average, or\n                    the
  assignment of inconvenient hours or unwelcome courses, and other forms\n                    of
  unwanted action taking the form and having the purpose of harassment. If\n                        profes-
  sors are to be free from external\n                    restraints in their pursuit
  of the truth, they must be as free from harass- ment as they are from the crippling\n
  \                   pressure of the possibility of summary dismissal. The American
  Asso- ciation of University Professors has\n                    always taken the
  position that the best security against most forms of\n                     harassment
  is to be found within the machinery of the\n                    institution itself.
  Thus, an essential element of the prevailing American\n                    conception
  of academic freedom is the principle of maximum faculty\n                    participation
  in the decision-making processes of the institution.\n                    Through
  faculty meetings, faculty committees, and other devices of\n                    communication,
  the faculty, it is believed, can achieve a responsible place\n                    in
  the making of institutional decisions. For example, institutions\n                    are
  encouraged to have faculty grievance committees, built into the\n                    official
  organizational system of the institution, for the adjustment of\n                    complaints.\n
  \               The whole concept of faculty involvement in insti-\n                        tutional
  government took a giant step forward in 1966, when\n                    three major
  groups in American higher educa-\n                    tion, the American Council
  on Education, the Ameri- can Association of University Professors, and the As- sociation
  of Governing Boards of\n                    Universities and Colleges, reached agreement
  on a joint Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities. This \n                        State-
  ment\n                     recognizes that college or university government is the
  joint\n                    responsibility of the various major elements of the academic
  community,\n                    faculties, administrators, governing boards, and
  students, since, it is\n                    noted, “the variety and complexity of
  the tasks performed by\n                        insti- tutions of higher education\n
  \                   produce an inescapable interdependence” among them. Joint\n
  \                   efforts by all components of the institution are needed for
  effective\n                    planning and communication, for budgeting, for the
  selection of the chief\n                    academic officials, and for the optimum
  use of facilities. More\n                    particularly, the tri- partite\n                    Statement
  recognizes that the faculty has\n                        “pri- mary\n                    responsibility”
  with respect to curriculum, sub- ject matter and methods of instruction, research,
  and\n                    those elements of student life which relate to the edu-
  cational process. The faculty determines the require- ments for the degrees offered
  in\n                    courses, and decides when and how degree requirements have
  been met.\n                    It is also recognized that the faculty has primary
  re- sponsibility with respect to academic appointments,\n                    reappointments,
  decisions not to reappoint, promo-\n                        tions, the granting
  of tenure, and dismissals. This re- sponsibility rests upon the fact that\n                    scholars
  in a par- ticular field have the\n                    chief competence for making
  judgments on all these matters of faculty\n                    status.\n                Of
  course, administrative review and board approval are part of the\n                    complicated
  procedures which are involved in making decisions on questions\n                    of
  faculty status, but faculty judgment on these matters should\n                    normally
  be decisive, and should not be overruled except for very\n                    compelling
  reasons, and in accordance with procedures spelled out in\n                    advance
  with explicit detail. In addition, it is agreed that the faculty\n                    should
  be consulted in the selection of department chairmen,015\n                     deans
  and presidents, and in the making of budget policy.\n                    Finally,
  it is recognized that if faculty partici- pation is to be meaningful, the institution
  must\n                    have suitable agencies for participation through regularly
  scheduled\n                    faculty meetings, representative assemblies, and
  faculty committees, of\n                    which at least the most important should
  be elected directly by the\n                    faculty.\n                The tripartite
  Statement reflects a dramatic change\n                    in the structure of American
  colleges and universities, for in the early\n                    days of higher
  education in America the faculty was weak and the president\n                    of
  the institu- tion was in a very\n                    commanding position. The historic
  position of the American university\n                    president was a powerful
  one from the very beginning, but changes have\n                    occurred in the
  course of history, and this has resulted in significant\n                    changes
  in the distribution of power within the institution. The basic\n                    historic
  fact is that in the United States there were college presi- dents long before there
  were\n                    professionally-trained, full-time, competent faculties
  completely\n                    committed to the teaching profession. The earliest
  teachers in the\n                    American colleges were mainly preachers who
  taught part-time, or who taught\n                    occasionally as an alternative
  to other activities. In contrast, from the\n                    very start the president
  was a full-time, fully-committed chief\n                    officer of the institution.
  The colleges were weak, professional\n                    faculties were unknown,
  and the only person who could speak for the\n                    college, defend
  it against its enemies in the community, and secure the\n                    necessary
  support, was the president. Thus, the president was strong\n                    because
  the faculty was weak.\n                The conditions which created the powerful
  presi-\n                    dent, however, disappeared with the rise of strong,\n
  \                   professionally-competent, full-time faculties, made up of scholars
  and\n                    teachers, able to insist upon sharing with the institution's
  administration\n                    the responsibility for making basic policy decisions.
  The growing involve- ment of American professors in the\n                    governance
  of their institution is a consequence of their professional\n                        com-
  petence. This is not to suggest that\n                    presidents are unimportant
  or without power, but in the modern age the\n                    professors have
  assumed the responsibility of exer-\n                        cising a large portion
  of the innovative function in higher\n                    education, for the president
  has become an extremely busy academic\n                    entrepreneur who lacks
  the time and energy to be concerned very much or\n                    very often
  with educational innovation.\n                The concept of a partnership between
  adminis-\n                        tration, teaching faculty, and students now dominates
  the\n                    American education scene. Professors do not regard themselves
  as mere\n                    employees who can be hired and fired at will, and the
  theory and practice\n                    of academic freedom, suitably buttressed
  by faculty participation in\n                    the governance of the institution,
  has rendered\n                     wholly untenable the conception of the professor
  as a hired\n                    hand.\n                Finally, the modern concept
  of academic freedom insists that the professor\n                    has a right
  to exercise all of the rights of citizenship, including freedom\n                    of
  speech and freedom of association, and that in exercising these\n                    rights
  he should be subjected to no institutional inter- ference or academic penalties.
  The 1940 Statement declares that the faculty member, as a\n                    citizen,
  has the right to speak or write free from institutional censor- ship or discipline,
  though attention is\n                    called to the professor's special obligation
  to be accurate, to\n                    exercise appropriate restraint, to show
  respect for the opinion of\n                    others, and to make every effort
  to indicate that he is not an\n                    institutional spokesman. It is
  widely recog-\n                    nized in the American academic community that
  a faculty member, like\n                    other citizens, should be free to engage
  in political activities so far as\n                    he can do so consistently
  with his professional obligations as a\n                    teacher and scholar.\n

  \               The main elements of academic freedom are securely established in
  those\n                    countries which recognize and respect the principles
  of intellectual and\n                    political free- dom. Academic freedom does
  not\n                    exist in dictatorship countries, or in countries which
  practice thought- control. This suggests that while\n                    academic
  freedom has its own special characteristics, it is invariably part\n                    of
  a larger pattern of human freedom. Furthermore, just as the other\n                    rights
  which modern man claims are sub- ject to\n                    the manifold pressures
  of a complex, problem-\n                        ridden, changing world, so does
  the right to academic freedom\n                    encounter powerful pressures
  which weaken or challenge the concept, and\n                    indeed, on some
  occa- sions and in some\n                    places, threaten its very existence.\n
  \               Some difficulties result, in the United States, from the very structure
  of\n                    the system of higher education which is, in reality, no
  system at all.\n                    There is no na- tional ministry of education,\n
  \                   and the role of the na- tional government in\n                    education
  at all levels is largely limited to making and administering\n                    financial
  grants. For the public institutions the power of control\n                    rests
  in the fifty state governments, and in the governing boards\n                    created
  by these governments. For the private institutions the power of\n                    control
  rests in the boards of trustees. Some measure of conformity with\n                    minimum
  general standards is achieved through the several re- gional accrediting associations,
  and through\n                    the efforts of national professional associations
  in specialized\n                    schools and colleges, such as those of law,
  medicine, pharmacy,\n                    architecture, and journalism. But on the
  whole, variety and local control\n                    are the central features of
  the American system of higher education. While the016\n                     spirit
  of localism may serve to insulate problems, in- cluding violations of academic freedom,
  it\n                    also encour- ages a chaotic tendency for the\n                    locally
  autonomous institution to proceed on an ad\n                    hoc basis free from
  the restraining influence of centralized standards\n                    of per-
  formance. The still very\n                    considerable administrative power
  of the typical American college or\n                    university president, exercised
  locally in a self-defining sit- uation, gives a willful or determined man\n                    great
  scope in which to operate with respect to his institution's\n                    personnel.\n
  \               In varying degrees throughout the world, the pro-\n                        fessor's
  academic freedom is often under pressure from all sorts\n                    of
  external forces—political parties and fac- tions, politicians, economic interests,
  religious\n                    groups, patriotic organizations, racial and national
  origins groups,\n                    and many others. In most institutions the influ-\n
  \                   ence of alumni and private donors is persistent and may be very\n
  \                   weighty. In many countries, and especially in the United States,
  there is a\n                    wide-spread, latent anti-intellectualism in large
  segments of the\n                    population which, under certain conditions,
  may contribute to the\n                    outside pressures which challenge or
  weaken the aca-\n                        demic freedom of the teachers. In a broader
  sense it may be\n                    noted that, in the nature of their calling,
  pro-\n                        fessors deal with new ideas, and it is often painful
  to work\n                    with new ideas in areas where popular values are deeply
  entrenched.\n                    Furthermore, the remarkable expansion of the social
  sciences in recent\n                    years has had the result of involving professors
  more and more with\n                    public issues on which large segments of
  the population are deeply divided.\n                    Such issues as those involving
  war and peace, labor relations, regulation\n                    of the economy,
  public ownership, and basic political change are\n                    likely to
  be highly combustible.\n                During the period following World War II
  the out-\n                        standing political fact on a global scale was
  the pro- tracted Cold War between the communist and\n                        demo-
  cratic communities of nations,\n                    particularly between the United
  States and the Soviet Union. The severe\n                        pres- sures generated
  by the Cold War\n                    exerted a profoundly disturbing impact upon
  educational institutions. In\n                    the United States the Cold War
  led to the imposition of various forms\n                    of loyalty oaths, which
  many professors regarded as invidiously insulting\n                    to them,
  to legislative investigations, and sundry purges. In addition,\n                    and
  again particularly in the United States, the post-World War II\n                    period
  witnessed an agonizing conflict over race relations, and the\n                    colleges
  and universities were deeply involved in situations growing out of\n                    this
  conflict. In many institutions the freedom of professors to take\n                    sides
  in this struggle was sharply challenged, and ad- ministrative reprisals were by
  no means unknown. Many\n                    censure actions of the American Association
  of\n                     University Professors, for example, were by-products of\n
  \                   tensions generated by the race issue.\n                Finally,
  all over the world, the decade of the 1960's was a time of serious\n                    student
  dissatisfaction and unrest. In many places student dissent ripened\n                    into
  disruption and violence, and led to stern measures on the part of\n                    institutional
  administrations and governments. There were large-scale\n                    police
  actions at such distinguished institutions as the University of\n                    California
  in Berkeley and Columbia University in New York, and\n                    massive
  military intervention against students in such cities as\n                    Paris,
  Mexico City, and Tokyo. The academic freedom of the institution as a\n                    whole
  was inevitably drawn into the maelstrom of issues which large-scale\n                    student
  vio- lence created.\n                Like so many other freedoms, academic freedom
  is experienced unevenly in the\n                    contemporary world. It is securely
  established in some countries, and\n                    scarcely exists in others,
  and in between the extremes it exists in\n                    varying degrees of
  amplitude and security. Where academic freedom is\n                    well-defined
  and respected, the teaching profession understands that the\n                    principle
  pro- tects the professor against the\n                    devastating conse- quences
  of arbitrary\n                    dismissal. It is recognized that the teacher can
  be dismissed only for\n                    adequate cause, as established in a proceeding
  which measures up to\n                    the requirements of due process, including
  a hearing before a tribunal\n                    consisting of his academic peers.
  It is well understood that the security\n                    of the professor depends
  not so much upon the substantive definition of\n                    what constitutes
  adequate cause, as upon the procedures which are\n                    followed.
  That proper procedure is an in-\n                        dispensable element of
  justice in the life of the state is a\n                    commonplace observation.
  Proper procedure is equally essential if academic\n                    freedom is
  to remain a viable concept.\n                \n                    \n                        BIBLIOGRAPHY\n

  of the History of IdeasAcademic freedom is the liberty of thought which\n                    is
  claimed by teachers and other elements of the educa- tional community. While the
  claim to freedom of the\n                    mind has a very long history—it was
  asserted in ancient Athens,\n                    for example, by Socrates—academic
  freedom, as the more\n                    specialized concern of the schools, is
  a rather modern phenomenon, having\n                    been first recog- nized
  in some of the\n                    universities of Western Europe in the sixteenth
  and seventeenth centuries.\n                    Emerging in the twelfth and thirteenth
  centuries, the university in\n                    the medieval age was to a considerable
  extent an autonomous corporate\n                    institution, but the master
  or teacher was subject to powerful restraints,\n                    both internal
  and external, and to the inhibiting force of authori- tative tradition. Beginning
  with\n                    the founding of the university at Leiden in 1575, academic
  freedom beganWhile academic freedom has by no means achieved universal acceptance
  in the\n                    contemporary world, it is accepted as the normal expectation
  in most\n                    countries of Western Europe, with the exception of
  the dictator- ships on the Iberian peninsula. It\n                    is not accepted
  by the communist or communist-dominated countries in\n                    Central
  and Eastern Europe and in Asia. It is significant that academic\n                    freedom
  is regarded, at least in princi- ple,\n                    as a necessary and desirable
  aspect of higher edu-\n                        cation in many of the developing
  countries of Africa, the Middle\n                    East, and the Far East. In
  the many coun-\n                    tries where academic freedom is understood and
  re- spected, however, there are two uses of the term\n                    which,
  if not fundamentally different, seem to differ in their points\n                    of
  emphasis. Thus, in Great Britain the term generally refers to the\n                    freedom
  of the educational institution as a whole from outside influences,\n                    political
  or otherwise.While this usage of the term is by no means unknown in the United States,
  in\n                    America it almost invariably refers to the freedom of the
  individual\n                    professor. Of course, outside influences are often
  brought to bear\n                    upon American colleges and universities, and
  the con-\n                        cept of academic freedom requires the institution
  to resist any\n                    attacks upon its freedom to act as a corporate
  body. Nevertheless, in\n                    accordance with the individ- ualistic\n
  \                   tendency of the concept of rights in American constitutional
  law, the claim\n                    to academic freedom is generally stated and
  tested in terms of\n                    individual teachers. Whatever may be the
  force of outside influ\n                    ences, the concept holds that the institution
  has an obligation\n                    to protect the rights of academic freedom
  for all of its faculty members.\n                    Since the ultimate power of
  control over an American college or university\n                    is vested in
  its governing board, a dismissal in violation of a\n                    professor's
  academic freedom simply cannot hap-\n                    pen unless the board decrees
  it. It follows that in the American\n                    system of higher education,
  responsibility for protecting the academic\n                    freedom of teachers
  rests with those who are legally in control of the\n                    institution,
  and who have the power not only to condone violations of\n                    that
  freedom, for example, by making improper dismissals, but also the\n                    power
  to protect the faculty against outside pressures and to defend their\n                    freedom.
  American experience indicates that even though a university\n                    may
  enjoy complete institutional autonomy, so far as external pressures are\n                    concerned,
  it is still possible for the university's administration to act\n                    in
  a manner which is injurious to the faculty's claim to academic\n                    freedom.Academic
  freedom is usually described as the right of each individual member\n                    of
  the faculty of an institu- tion to enjoy\n                    the freedom to study,
  to inquire, to speak his mind, to communicate his\n                    ideas, and
  to assert the truth as he sees it. In the United States, the\n                    professor's
  academic freedom is often defined in terms of full freedom\n                    in
  research and in the publication of the results, in classroom discussion\n                    of
  his subject, and in the exercise extra-murally of his basic rights as a\n                        citi-
  zen. But in America, and increasingly\n                    in other parts of the
  world, the concept of academic freedom has been\n                    broadened to
  include students as well as teachers. The freedom of the\n                    professor
  to teach is merely one side of the coin of academic freedom, the\n                    other
  side being the freedom of the student to learn.In the historical sense this concept
  is neither very novel nor particularly\n                    American. It was a familiar
  point in the great days of German higher\n                    education, during
  the half century preceding World War I, that a close\n                    affinity
  between Lehrfreiheit and Lernfreiheit was rec- ognized,\n                    though
  for the student the freedom to learn assumed characteristics not\n                    generally
  to be found in other countries. Once he had received the abitur (an examination
  taken at age 19 or 20, at the\n                    end of thegymnasium period),
  he was free to wander from school\n                    to school, to attend classes
  as he chose, and to take examinations whenever\n                    he felt prepared,
  and to try again if he failed. Otherwise he was never\n                    given
  grades and the flunk-out for unsatisfactory scholarship was\n                    unknown.
  This sort of student freedom was not widely practiced or\n                    recognized
  in other countries.By the third quarter of the twentieth century, uni-The Statement
  points out that “freedom to teach\n                    and freedom to learn are
  inseparable facets of academic\n                    freedom.” It is noted that since
  “free inquiry and\n                    free expression are indispensable to the
  attainment” of the\n                    goals of academic institutions—which are:
  “the trans- mission of knowledge, the pursuit of\n                    truth, the
  devel- opment of students, and\n                    the general well-being of\n
  \                   society”—“students should be encouraged to\n                    develop
  the capacity for critical judgment and to engage in a\n                    sustained
  and independent search for truth.” To this end, the\n                        Statement
  spells out the rights of students as\n                    regards institutional
  admission policies, in the class- room, in respect to student records, student affairs,\n
  \                   and off-campus activities. In the area of student affairs, various\n
  \                   standards are stated with respect to freedom of association,
  freedom of\n                    inquiry and expression, par- ticipation in\n                    institutional
  government, and student publications. A detailed final\n                    section
  seeks to delineate, with considerable particularity, procedural\n                    standards
  in disciplinary proceedings, to the end that students may\n                    enjoy
  a full measure of due process.The fundamental case for academic freedom has always
  been that while it\n                    confers desired benefits upon the professors
  who enjoy it, it is defensible\n                    mainly on the ground that the
  unhampered search for the truth is for\n                    the benefit of society
  as a whole. A basic premiss is that final truth in\n                    all branches
  of human knowledge has not yet been achieved, and that new\n                    truths
  will emerge only as ideas clash with ideas in an unrestricted\n                    marketplace
  of ideas. In the words of Cardinal New-\n                    man (1872), a true
  university or college is a place “in\n                     which the intellect may
  safely range and speculate, sure to\n                    find its equal in some
  antagonistic activity, and its judge in the tribunal\n                    of truth.
  It is a place where inquiry is pushed forward, and discoveries\n                    verified
  and perfected, and rashness rendered innocuous, and error\n                    exposed,
  by the collision of mind with mind, and knowledge with\n                    knowledge”
  (“What is a University?,”Historical Sketches [1872], I, 16). Thus it has been\n
  \                   asserted that academic freedom exists “in order that society
  may\n                    have the benefit of honest judgment and independent criticism
  which\n                    otherwise might be with- held because of fear\n                    of
  offending a dominant group or transient social attitude”\n                    (Clark
  Byse and Louis Joughin, Tenure in American Higher\n                        Education
  [1959], p. 4).The eminent scholars (including the distinguished historian of ideas,
  Arthur\n                    O. Lovejoy) who founded the American Association of
  University Professors\n                    in 1915 published a Declaration of Principles
  which\n                    stated the rationale for academic freedom that has been
  generally\n                    accepted by the American academic community. They
  pointed out that while\n                    professors are the appointees of the
  university's trustees, they are not in\n                    any proper sense the
  trustees' employees, just as federal judges are\n                    appointed by
  the President without becoming, as a consequence, the Chief\n                    Executive's
  employees. “For, once appointed,” they\n                    declared, “the scholar
  has pro-\n                        fessional functions to perform in which the appointing\n
  \                   authorities have neither competency nor moral right to\n                    intervene.”
  And they added: “A university is a great\n                    and indispensable
  organ of the higher life of a civilized community, in the\n                    work
  of which the trustees hold an essential and highly honorable place,\n                    but
  in which the faculties hold an independent place, with quite equal\n                    responsibilities—and
  in relation to purely scientific and\n                    educational questions,
  the primary responsibility.” Stressing\n                    the nature of the academic
  calling, they wrote that “if\n                    education is the cornerstone of
  the structure of society, and if progress\n                    in scientific knowledge
  is essential to civilization, few things can be\n                    more impor-
  tant than to enhance the dignity\n                    of the scholar's pro- fession,
  with a view to\n                    attracting to its ranks men of the highest ability,
  of sound learning, and\n                    of strong and independent character.”A
  similar conception of the nature of academic freedom has, in recent years,\n                    been
  adopted by the United States Supreme Court. Speaking for the\n                    Court
  in 1957, Chief Justice Warren declared:The essentiality of freedom in the community
  of American\n                            universities is almost self-evident. No
  one should underes- timate the vital role in a\n                            democracy
  that is played by those who guide and train our youth. To\n                            impose
  any strait jacket upon the intellectual leaders in our\n                            colleges
  and universities would imperil the future of our Nation.\n                            No
  field of education\n                        (Sweezy v. New\n                            Hampshire,
  354 U.S. 234, 250).\n                    Similarly, in a concurring opinion filed
  in this case, Justice Frankfurter\n                    wrote:These pages need not
  be burdened with proof, based on the testimony\n                            of a
  cloud of impressive witnesses, of the dependence of a free\n                            society
  on free universities. This means the exclusion of\n                            governmental
  intervention in the intellec-\n                                tual life of a university.
  It matters little whether\n                            such intervention occurs
  avowedly or through action that in- evitably tends to check the ardor\n                            and
  fearlessness of scholars, qualities at once so fragile and so\n                            indispensable
  for fruitful academic labor\n                        (ibid., 354 U.S. 262).\n                    More
  recently, again speaking for the Supreme Court, Justice Brennan\n                    observed:Our
  Nation is deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom,\n                            which
  is of transcendent value to all of us and not merely to the\n                            teachers
  concerned. That freedom is therefore a special concern of\n                            the
  First Amendment, which does not tolerate laws that cast a pall\n                            of
  orthodoxy over the classroom. “The vigilant\n                            protection
  of constitutional freedom is nowhere more vital than in\n                            the
  community of American schools.”... The classroom is\n                            peculiarly
  the “marketplace of ideas.” The\n                            Nation's future depends
  upon leaders trained through wide exposure\n                            to that
  robust ex- change of ideas\n                            which discovers truth “out
  of a multitude of tongues,\n                            [rather] than through any
  kind of authoritative\n                            selection”\n                        (Keyishian
  v. Board of\n                                Regents of New York, 385 U.S. 589,
  603 [1967]).\n                    Thus, by the late 1960's, the concept of academic
  freedom had been accepted\n                    by the United States Su- preme Court
  as an\n                    integral part of the civil liberties law of the country.
  This concept was\n                    by then also regarded by the academic community
  as an essential\n                    element of the American system of intellectual
  free-\n                        dom. It was widely believed that the schools play
  an\n                    indispensable role in the progress of civilization, that
  the colleges and\n                    universities were the country's most important
  instruments for the\n                    generation and testing of new ideas and
  the advancement of scientific knowl- edge, and for the training of new\n                    leadership
  in govern- ment, in the\n                    professions, and in the economy. Since
  leaders in a rapidly changing world\n                    should not be slaves to
  routine, but must, on the contrary, be able to\n                    take the initiative,
  handle new ideas, solve new problems, evaluate\n                    evidence, think
  rationally, and act purpose-\n                    fully, it was felt that only a
  free educational system\n                     can produce such leadership. In a
  broader sense, it was widely\n                    understood that in a fluid, open,
  democratic society, in which the legally\n                    protected right to
  dissent inevitably creates an atmosphere of controversy,\n                    the
  schools cannot insulate their students from controversy, since\n                    this
  would leave them unprepared to take their rightful places in a society\n                    in
  which controversy is a daily and indispensable condition. Furthermore,\n                    a
  democratic, self-governing society cannot afford the risk of having\n                    an
  ignorant and unenlightened citizenry. Self-government means that the\n                    citizen
  must be able to govern himself, that is to say, to control his\n                    emotions,
  to use his reason, and to be concerned with the public\n                    interest.
  To this end the schools, functioning in an atmosphere of academic\n                    freedom,
  make a weighty contribution. It follows that the freedom of\n                    teachers
  to teach and of students to learn is essential to democ- racy, to progress, to the
  security of a\n                    way of life com- mitted to the maximizing of\n
  \                   human freedom.The world over, wherever the principle of academic
  freedom has been\n                    understood and respected, it has been closely
  tied to the concept of\n                    tenure, since security of employment
  is an essential precondition for\n                    the unhampered exercise of
  academic freedom. While there are\n                    variations on the general
  theme, the concept of tenure which has taken root\n                    in the United
  States comes to this: after a teacher has served on a\n                    faculty
  for a limited, prescribed number of years in proba- tionary status, he acquires
  a\n                    permanent position.The American Association of University
  Professors has sought, during the\n                    past half century, to standardize
  the maximum duration of the probationary\n                    period. The influential
  1940 Statement of\n                    Principles, which it nego- tiated with\n
  \                   the Association of American Colleges, and which has been endorsed
  by over\n                    sixty learned societies since its adoption, prescribed
  that the maximum\n                        dura- tion of the probationary period\n
  \                   should be seven years. That is to say, after a teacher has served
  on a\n                    faculty for seven years in probationary status, the institution
  has an\n                    obligation to make up its mind whether to let him go
  or keep him\n                    permanently by granting him tenure. Tenure means
  that the teacher, having\n                    been found adequate by the institution
  during the proba- tionary period, is now entitled to hold his position\n                    until
  retirement. It is recognized, however, that the concept does not\n                    mean
  that a tenured professor can never be dismissed under any conceivable\n                    circumstances.
  On the contrary, it is agreed that the institution has a\n                    right
  to dismiss a tenured professor, but only if there is adequate\n                    cause
  for the dismissal, and only if adequate cause is established by\n                    procedures
  which satisfy the rigorous demands of due process. In addition,\n                    it
  isThe essence of the tenure concept, then, is the rec-\n                        ognition
  of the right to serve until retirement, unless there is\n                    an
  earlier dismissal for an adequate reason established through procedures\n                    which
  measure up to the requirements of justice by assuring the\n                    individual
  concerned the protection of due process. This means that\n                    before
  the administration of an institution makes an unfavorable\n                    recommendation
  to the governing board, the faculty member must be given a\n                    statement
  of specific charges, served upon him long enough in advance\n                    so
  that he has adequate time to prepare his defense. Following the service\n                    of
  charges, he is entitled to be heard, in the first instance, by a faculty\n                        commit-
  tee, preferably an elected\n                    committee not directly con- trolled
  by the\n                    administration. Due process also assures the individual
  all of the elements\n                    of a fair hearing, such as the right to
  be heard in his own defense, the\n                    right to counsel, the right
  to offer witnesses and to confront and\n                    cross-examine witnesses
  who appear against him, and a right to a\n                    stenographic record
  of all hearings. Due process also demands that findings\n                    of
  fact and the ultimate decision should be based on the hearing rec- ord.In addition,
  the burden of proof to establish the existence of adequate\n                    cause
  for a dismissal is on those who brought the charges, since the grant\n                    of
  tenure establishes a presumption of competence comparable to the\n                    presumption
  of innocence which defendants enjoy in criminal cases. If the\n                    faculty
  hearing commit- tee decides in favor\n                    of the involved faculty
  member, the normal expectation is that the charges\n                    will be
  dropped. If the administration persists in bringing the\n                    charges
  to the governing body for final action, then that body is expected\n                    to
  give the individual a hearing embracing all of the basic elements of due\n                    process.
  When a faculty committee has made a decision favora- ble to the individual, then
  an especially heavy\n                    burden of proof rests upon those who persist
  in pressing the charges.Thus, the real protection for the tenured professor, so
  far as dismissal is\n                    concerned, depends far more upon the procedures
  available to him, than upon\n                    any sub- stantive definition of
  the term\n                    academic freedom. Fur- thermore, while the\n                    rules
  of academic due process seek to protect the professor against\n                    injustice,
  they also protect the institution and its administration from\n                        act-
  ing unjustly and making mistakes.\n                    Speaking in the wider context
  of governmental action, Justice Jackson\n                    urged that it should
  not be overlooked that “due proc\n                    ess of law is not for the
  sole benefit of an accused. It is the\n                    best insurance for the
  Government itself against those blunders which leave\n                    lasting
  stains on a system of justice but which are bound to occur on\n                    ex
  parte consideration” (Shaughnessy v.\n                        United States ex rel.
  Mezei, 345 U.S. 206,\n                    224-25 [1953], dissenting opinion). When
  a professor is dismissed\n                    arbitrarily, without charges and a
  chance to be heard in a fair\n                    proceeding, not only is the professor
  treated wrongly, but the institution\n                    deprives itself of the
  benefits and guidance which would be secured by\n                    following proper
  procedures. An arbitrary dismissal also prevents the\n                    academic
  community from having confidence in the institution's course of\n                    action,
  since there are bound to be doubts about the acceptability of\n                    administrative
  decisions which were taken with faulty procedure. Due\n                    process
  is regarded as vital for the academic commu-\n                        nity, as it
  is in the general community, because it is society's\n                    best assurance
  that the action was taken justly.In the United States there are a number of associa-\n
  \                       tions concerned with defining and defending the pro- fessor's
  claim to academic freedom, such\n                    as the Ameri- can Civil Liberties
  Union,\n                    various teachers' unions, the American Association for
  Higher Education (an\n                    affiliate of the National Educational
  Association), and many other\n                    groups. Since its establishment
  in 1915, however, the chief spokesman for\n                    the academic freedom
  rights of teachers in the world of higher education\n                    has been
  the American Association of University Professors. Over the\n                    years
  the Association has spelled out the content of academic freedom, both\n                    substantive
  and procedural, in numerous statements of principles and\n                    has
  dealt with specific complaints submitted to it by aggrieved professors.\n                    Complaints
  alleging improper dismissals are referred to the Association's\n                    oldest
  and most influential committee, Committee A, on Aca- demic Freedom and Tenure. During
  the past half cen- tury the Committee, with the assistance of\n                    professional
  staff in the central office in Washington, has dealt with\n                    hundreds
  of cases, and has developed a large and so- phisticated body of interpretations
  and common law\n                    principles which relate to various aspects of
  academic freedom.Once the General Secretary of the Association has concluded that
  there is a\n                        prima facie case for believing that a\n                    serious
  violation of an important principle of academic freedom and tenure\n                    has
  occurred, he ap- points an investigating\n                    committee of disinterested
  scholars. Following its investigation, the ad\n                    hoc com- mittee
  reports to Committee A, which\n                    then decides whether to accept
  the report, and whether it should be\n                    published in the quarterly
  journal of the Association.There is every reason to believe that this weapon of
  the Association is very\n                    effective, even though it does not
  go beyond the expression of moral\n                    disapproval. Administrations
  on censure are removed from the list by\n                    vote of the annual
  delegate meeting of the Associa-\n                        tion on the recommendation
  of Committee A. This occurs when it\n                    has been decided that the
  dereliction which led to the censure action has\n                    been corrected.
  Generally this takes the form of changes in the institu- tion's rules and procedures,
  and\n                    the award to the in- jured party of some sort of\n                    redress.There
  are active associations of university teachers in the other\n                    English-speaking
  countries, notably Great Britain, Canada, Australia, in\n                    the
  Scandinavian coun- tries, and rather less\n                    effective associations
  in most of the other countries of Western Europe. In\n                    addition
  there is an International Association of University Pro- fessors and Lecturers,
  with a part-time\n                        Secretary- General, but this is\n                    essentially
  an association of auton- omous\n                    national bodies, and is limited
  in activity to the holding of periodical\n                    conferences and seminars.The
  concept of academic freedom embraces more than mere protection against\n                    arbitrary
  dismissals, though the central purpose of tenure is to protect\n                    the
  teacher against such dismissals. In fact, professors often have\n                    occasion
  to complain about many other forms of mistreatment. The American\n                    Association,
  for example, has received frequent complaints about denial of\n                    salary
  increases, or the receipt of increases below the average, or\n                    the
  assignment of inconvenient hours or unwelcome courses, and other forms\n                    of
  unwanted action taking the form and having the purpose of harassment. If\n                        profes-
  sors are to be free from external\n                    restraints in their pursuit
  of the truth, they must be as free from harass- ment as they are from the crippling\n
  \                   pressure of the possibility of summary dismissal. The American
  Asso- ciation of University Professors has\n                    always taken the
  position that the best security against most forms of\n                     harassment
  is to be found within the machinery of the\n                    institution itself.
  Thus, an essential element of the prevailing American\n                    conception
  of academic freedom is the principle of maximum faculty\n                    participation
  in the decision-making processes of the institution.\n                    Through
  faculty meetings, faculty committees, and other devices of\n                    communication,
  the faculty, it is believed, can achieve a responsible place\n                    in
  the making of institutional decisions. For example, institutions\n                    are
  encouraged to have faculty grievance committees, built into the\n                    official
  organizational system of the institution, for the adjustment of\n                    complaints.The
  whole concept of faculty involvement in insti-\n                        tutional
  government took a giant step forward in 1966, when\n                    three major
  groups in American higher educa-\n                    tion, the American Council
  on Education, the Ameri- can Association of University Professors, and the As- sociation
  of Governing Boards of\n                    Universities and Colleges, reached agreement
  on a joint Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities. This \n                        State-
  ment\n                     recognizes that college or university government is the
  joint\n                    responsibility of the various major elements of the academic
  community,\n                    faculties, administrators, governing boards, and
  students, since, it is\n                    noted, “the variety and complexity of
  the tasks performed by\n                        insti- tutions of higher education\n
  \                   produce an inescapable interdependence” among them. Joint\n
  \                   efforts by all components of the institution are needed for
  effective\n                    planning and communication, for budgeting, for the
  selection of the chief\n                    academic officials, and for the optimum
  use of facilities. More\n                    particularly, the tri- partite\n                    Statement
  recognizes that the faculty has\n                        “pri- mary\n                    responsibility”
  with respect to curriculum, sub- ject matter and methods of instruction, research,
  and\n                    those elements of student life which relate to the edu-
  cational process. The faculty determines the require- ments for the degrees offered
  in\n                    courses, and decides when and how degree requirements have
  been met.\n                    It is also recognized that the faculty has primary
  re- sponsibility with respect to academic appointments,\n                    reappointments,
  decisions not to reappoint, promo-\n                        tions, the granting
  of tenure, and dismissals. This re- sponsibility rests upon the fact that\n                    scholars
  in a par- ticular field have the\n                    chief competence for making
  judgments on all these matters of faculty\n                    status.Of course,
  administrative review and board approval are part of the\n                    complicated
  procedures which are involved in making decisions on questions\n                    of
  faculty status, but faculty judgment on these matters should\n                    normally
  be decisive, and should not be overruled except for very\n                    compelling
  reasons, and in accordance with procedures spelled out in\n                    advance
  with explicit detail. In addition, it is agreed that the faculty\n                    should
  be consulted in the selection of department chairmen,The tripartite Statement reflects
  a dramatic change\n                    in the structure of American colleges and
  universities, for in the early\n                    days of higher education in
  America the faculty was weak and the president\n                    of the institu-
  tion was in a very\n                    commanding position. The historic position
  of the American university\n                    president was a powerful one from
  the very beginning, but changes have\n                    occurred in the course
  of history, and this has resulted in significant\n                    changes in
  the distribution of power within the institution. The basic\n                    historic
  fact is that in the United States there were college presi- dents long before there
  were\n                    professionally-trained, full-time, competent faculties
  completely\n                    committed to the teaching profession. The earliest
  teachers in the\n                    American colleges were mainly preachers who
  taught part-time, or who taught\n                    occasionally as an alternative
  to other activities. In contrast, from the\n                    very start the president
  was a full-time, fully-committed chief\n                    officer of the institution.
  The colleges were weak, professional\n                    faculties were unknown,
  and the only person who could speak for the\n                    college, defend
  it against its enemies in the community, and secure the\n                    necessary
  support, was the president. Thus, the president was strong\n                    because
  the faculty was weak.The conditions which created the powerful presi-\n                    dent,
  however, disappeared with the rise of strong,\n                    professionally-competent,
  full-time faculties, made up of scholars and\n                    teachers, able
  to insist upon sharing with the institution's administration\n                    the
  responsibility for making basic policy decisions. The growing involve- ment of American
  professors in the\n                    governance of their institution is a consequence
  of their professional\n                        com- petence. This is not to suggest
  that\n                    presidents are unimportant or without power, but in the
  modern age the\n                    professors have assumed the responsibility of
  exer-\n                        cising a large portion of the innovative function
  in higher\n                    education, for the president has become an extremely
  busy academic\n                    entrepreneur who lacks the time and energy to
  be concerned very much or\n                    very often with educational innovation.The
  concept of a partnership between adminis-\n                        tration, teaching
  faculty, and students now dominates the\n                    American education
  scene. Professors do not regard themselves as mere\n                    employees
  who can be hired and fired at will, and the theory and practice\n                    of
  academic freedom, suitably buttressed by faculty participation in\n                    the
  governance of the institution, has rendered\n                     wholly untenable
  the conception of the professor as a hired\n                    hand.Finally, the
  modern concept of academic freedom insists that the professor\n                    has
  a right to exercise all of the rights of citizenship, including freedom\n                    of
  speech and freedom of association, and that in exercising these\n                    rights
  he should be subjected to no institutional inter- ference or academic penalties.
  The 1940 Statement declares that the faculty member, as a\n                    citizen,
  has the right to speak or write free from institutional censor- ship or discipline,
  though attention is\n                    called to the professor's special obligation
  to be accurate, to\n                    exercise appropriate restraint, to show
  respect for the opinion of\n                    others, and to make every effort
  to indicate that he is not an\n                    institutional spokesman. It is
  widely recog-\n                    nized in the American academic community that
  a faculty member, like\n                    other citizens, should be free to engage
  in political activities so far as\n                    he can do so consistently
  with his professional obligations as a\n                    teacher and scholar.The
  main elements of academic freedom are securely established in those\n                    countries
  which recognize and respect the principles of intellectual and\n                    political
  free- dom. Academic freedom does not\n                    exist in dictatorship
  countries, or in countries which practice thought- control. This suggests that while\n
  \                   academic freedom has its own special characteristics, it is
  invariably part\n                    of a larger pattern of human freedom. Furthermore,
  just as the other\n                    rights which modern man claims are sub- ject
  to\n                    the manifold pressures of a complex, problem-\n                        ridden,
  changing world, so does the right to academic freedom\n                    encounter
  powerful pressures which weaken or challenge the concept, and\n                    indeed,
  on some occa- sions and in some\n                    places, threaten its very existence.Some
  difficulties result, in the United States, from the very structure of\n                    the
  system of higher education which is, in reality, no system at all.\n                    There
  is no na- tional ministry of education,\n                    and the role of the
  na- tional government in\n                    education at all levels is largely
  limited to making and administering\n                    financial grants. For the
  public institutions the power of control\n                    rests in the fifty
  state governments, and in the governing boards\n                    created by these
  governments. For the private institutions the power of\n                    control
  rests in the boards of trustees. Some measure of conformity with\n                    minimum
  general standards is achieved through the several re- gional accrediting associations,
  and through\n                    the efforts of national professional associations
  in specialized\n                    schools and colleges, such as those of law,
  medicine, pharmacy,\n                    architecture, and journalism. But on the
  whole, variety and local control\n                    are the central features of
  the American system of higher education. While theIn varying degrees throughout
  the world, the pro-\n                        fessor's academic freedom is often
  under pressure from all sorts\n                    of external forces—political
  parties and fac- tions, politicians, economic interests, religious\n                    groups,
  patriotic organizations, racial and national origins groups,\n                    and
  many others. In most institutions the influ-\n                    ence of alumni
  and private donors is persistent and may be very\n                    weighty. In
  many countries, and especially in the United States, there is a\n                    wide-spread,
  latent anti-intellectualism in large segments of the\n                    population
  which, under certain conditions, may contribute to the\n                    outside
  pressures which challenge or weaken the aca-\n                        demic freedom
  of the teachers. In a broader sense it may be\n                    noted that, in
  the nature of their calling, pro-\n                        fessors deal with new
  ideas, and it is often painful to work\n                    with new ideas in areas
  where popular values are deeply entrenched.\n                    Furthermore, the
  remarkable expansion of the social sciences in recent\n                    years
  has had the result of involving professors more and more with\n                    public
  issues on which large segments of the population are deeply divided.\n                    Such
  issues as those involving war and peace, labor relations, regulation\n                    of
  the economy, public ownership, and basic political change are\n                    likely
  to be highly combustible.During the period following World War II the out-\n                        standing
  political fact on a global scale was the pro- tracted Cold War between the communist
  and\n                        demo- cratic communities of nations,\n                    particularly
  between the United States and the Soviet Union. The severe\n                        pres-
  sures generated by the Cold War\n                    exerted a profoundly disturbing
  impact upon educational institutions. In\n                    the United States
  the Cold War led to the imposition of various forms\n                    of loyalty
  oaths, which many professors regarded as invidiously insulting\n                    to
  them, to legislative investigations, and sundry purges. In addition,\n                    and
  again particularly in the United States, the post-World War II\n                    period
  witnessed an agonizing conflict over race relations, and the\n                    colleges
  and universities were deeply involved in situations growing out of\n                    this
  conflict. In many institutions the freedom of professors to take\n                    sides
  in this struggle was sharply challenged, and ad- ministrative reprisals were by
  no means unknown. Many\n                    censure actions of the American Association
  of\n                     University Professors, for example, were by-products of\n
  \                   tensions generated by the race issue.Finally, all over the world,
  the decade of the 1960's was a time of serious\n                    student dissatisfaction
  and unrest. In many places student dissent ripened\n                    into disruption
  and violence, and led to stern measures on the part of\n                    institutional
  administrations and governments. There were large-scale\n                    police
  actions at such distinguished institutions as the University of\n                    California
  in Berkeley and Columbia University in New York, and\n                    massive
  military intervention against students in such cities as\n                    Paris,
  Mexico City, and Tokyo. The academic freedom of the institution as a\n                    whole
  was inevitably drawn into the maelstrom of issues which large-scale\n                    student
  vio- lence created.Like so many other freedoms, academic freedom is experienced
  unevenly in the\n                    contemporary world. It is securely established
  in some countries, and\n                    scarcely exists in others, and in between
  the extremes it exists in\n                    varying degrees of amplitude and
  security. Where academic freedom is\n                    well-defined and respected,
  the teaching profession understands that the\n                    principle pro-
  tects the professor against the\n                    devastating conse- quences
  of arbitrary\n                    dismissal. It is recognized that the teacher can
  be dismissed only for\n                    adequate cause, as established in a proceeding
  which measures up to\n                    the requirements of due process, including
  a hearing before a tribunal\n                    consisting of his academic peers.
  It is well understood that the security\n                    of the professor depends
  not so much upon the substantive definition of\n                    what constitutes
  adequate cause, as upon the procedures which are\n                    followed.
  That proper procedure is an in-\n                        dispensable element of
  justice in the life of the state is a\n                    commonplace observation.
  Proper procedure is equally essential if academic\n                    freedom is
  to remain a viable concept.The leading history of academic freedom, with special
  reference to the\n                        United States, is Richard Hofstadter and
  Walter P. Metzger, The Development of Academic Freedom in the United\n                            States
  (New York, 1955). The principal study of the tenure\n                        concept
  in American higher education is by Clark Byse and Louis\n                        Joughin,
  Tenure in American Higher Education\n                        (Ithaca, N.Y., 1959).
  Louis Joughin, ed., Academic\n                            Freedom and Tenure (Madison,
  1967), contains most of the basic\n                        statements of principles
  adopted by the American Association of\n                        University Professors,
  as well as six important journal articles on the\n                        subject
  of academic freedom and tenure. Policy statements of the\n                        American
  Civil Liberties Union on academic freedom and due process are\n                        reprinted
  in the American Association of University Professors, Bul- letin,\n                        42
