  computing professionals must become familiar with historical computer architectures
  because many of the same or similar techniques are still being used and may persist
  well into the future. Computer Architecture: Fundamentals and Principles of Computer
  Design discusses the fundamental principles of computer design and performance enhancement
  that have proven effective and demonstrates how current trends in architecture and
  implementation rely on these principles while expanding upon them or applying them
  in new ways. Rather than focusing on a particular type of machine, this textbook
  explains concepts and techniques via examples drawn from various architectures and
  implementations. When necessary, the author creates simplified examples that clearly
  explain architectural and implementation features used across many computing platforms.
  Following an introduction that discusses the difference between architecture and
  implementation and how they relate, the next four chapters cover the architecture
  of traditional, single-processor systems that are still, after 60 years, the most
  widely used computing machines. The final two chapters explore approaches to adopt
  when single-processor systems do not reach desired levels of performance or are
  not suited for intended applications. Topics include parallel systems, major classifications
  of architectures, and characteristics of unconventional systems of the past, present,
  and future.This textbook provides students with a thorough grounding in what constitutes
  high performance and how to measure it, as well as a full familiarity in the fundamentals
  needed to make systems perform better. This knowledge enables them to understand
  and evaluate the many new systems they will encounter throughout their professional
  careers.

  computing professionals must become familiar with historical computer architectures
  because many of the same or similar techniques are still being used and may persist
  well into the future. Computer Architecture: Fundamentals and Principles of Computer
  Design discusses the fundamental principles of computer design and performance enhancement
  that have proven effective and demonstrates how current trends in architecture and
  implementation rely on these principles while expanding upon them or applying them
  in new ways. Rather than focusing on a particular type of machine, this textbook
  explains concepts and techniques via examples drawn from various architectures and
  implementations. When necessary, the author creates simplified examples that clearly
  explain architectural and implementation features used across many computing platforms.
  Following an introduction that discusses the difference between architecture and
  implementation and how they relate, the next four chapters cover the architecture
  of traditional, single-processor systems that are still, after 60 years, the most
  widely used computing machines. The final two chapters explore approaches to adopt
  when single-processor systems do not reach desired levels of performance or are
  not suited for intended applications. Topics include parallel systems, major classifications
  of architectures, and characteristics of unconventional systems of the past, present,
  and future.This textbook provides students with a thorough grounding in what constitutes
  high performance and how to measure it, as well as a full familiarity in the fundamentals
  needed to make systems perform better. This knowledge enables them to understand
  and evaluate the many new systems they will encounter throughout their professional
  careers.
