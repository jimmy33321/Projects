  Mission
- |
  Mathematics illuminates the patterns that abound in our world. The National Museum of Mathematics strives to enhance public understanding and perception of mathematics. Its dynamic exhibits and programs stimulate inquiry, spark curiosity, and reveal the wonders of mathematics. The Museum’s activities lead a broad and diverse audience to understand the evolving, creative, human, and aesthetic nature of mathematics.
- |
  Brief history
- |
  The National Museum of Mathematics began in response to the closing of a small museum of mathematics on Long Island, the Goudreau Museum. A group of interested parties (the “Working Group”) met in August 2008 to explore the creation of a new museum of mathematics — one that would go well beyond the Goudreau in both its scope and methodology. The group quickly discovered that there was no museum of mathematics in the United States, and yet there was incredible demand for hands-on math programming.Accomplishments to date include: opening Manhattan’s only hands-on science center, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors; creating the popular Math Midway exhibition, which delighted over 750,000 visitors at museums throughout the United States; leading math tours in various U.S. cities; running dozens of Math Encounters and Family Fridays presentations; delivering many other programs for students, teachers, and the public to increase appreciation of mathematics; and creating the largest public outdoor demonstration of the Pythagorean Theorem ever.
- |
  Organization
- |
  The Museum is governed by a Board of Trustees, receives intellectual guidance from an Advisory Council, and operates with the assistance of the Working Group. Arthur Steinmetz serves as Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Museum, and Cindy Lawrence as the Museum’s Executive Director & CEO.

  Charter

  the patterns that abound in our world. The National Museum of Mathematics strives
  to enhance public understanding and perception of mathematics. Its dynamic exhibits
  and programs stimulate inquiry, spark curiosity, and reveal the wonders of mathematics.
  The Museum’s activities lead a broad and diverse audience to understand the evolving,
  creative, human, and aesthetic nature of mathematics.\nBrief history\nThe National
  Museum of Mathematics began in response to the closing of a small museum of mathematics
  on Long Island, the Goudreau Museum. A group of interested parties (the “Working
  Group”) met in August 2008 to explore the creation of a new museum of mathematics
  — one that would go well beyond the Goudreau in both its scope and methodology.
  The group quickly discovered that there was no museum of mathematics in the United
  States, and yet there was incredible demand for hands-on math programming.Accomplishments
  to date include: opening Manhattan’s only hands-on science center, attracting hundreds
  of thousands of visitors; creating the popular Math Midway exhibition, which delighted
  over 750,000 visitors at museums throughout the United States; leading math tours
  in various U.S. cities; running dozens of Math Encounters and Family Fridays presentations;
  delivering many other programs for students, teachers, and the public to increase
  appreciation of mathematics; and creating the largest public outdoor demonstration
  of the Pythagorean Theorem ever.\nOrganization\nThe Museum is governed by a Board
  of Trustees, receives intellectual guidance from an Advisory Council, and operates
  with the assistance of the Working Group. Arthur Steinmetz serves as Chair of the
  Board of Trustees of the Museum, and Cindy Lawrence as the Museum’s Executive Director
  & CEO.\nCharter\nThe Museum received its provisional charter from the New York State
  Department of Education on 2009 November 17 and its absolute charter on 2015 September
  15.\n\nMoMath Team\n\nGlen WhitneyPresident & Founder\nCindy Lawrence\nExecutive
