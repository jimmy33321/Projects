  to the letter -- diligently saving at least 10% of your income, maxing out your
  retirement savings accounts, avoiding high-interest debt, living below your means
  -- and assuming (or crossing your fingers) that you’ll be set for retirement and
  whatever life throws in your path until then.But how confident are you that you’re
  truly on track? Back-of-the-envelope calculations and simple online retirement calculators
  aren’t exactly the most reliable ways to ensure with confidence that you’re going
  to reach your goals. And do you really want to leave something this important up
  to guesswork?Accounting for All the “What Ifs”Will your money run out before you
  die? That may sound crass, but it’s the question that every investor needs to answer…
  with certainty. The only way to do that is to crunch the numbers and consider all
  of the potential scenarios. For example:\n"
- "\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat if you or your spouse decides to exit the workforce for a while
  to raise children?What if stock market returns are lackluster for the next 10 years?How
  will higher education costs or caring for an elderly relative affect your investable
  resources?Exactly what income will be required in the future to provide the lifestyle
  you envision for you and your family?What areas of your portfolio are most vulnerable
  to market fluctuations?What if Social Security doesn’t provide the same level of
  benefits in the future?You can’t really know if you’re saving enough for your future
  -- and saving in the right way -- until you put your investing plan through the
  paces by using historical returns and other reality-based scenarios.This is the
  kind of rigorous testing planners do for their high net worth clients. Using sophisticated
  calculations and modeling, they regularly take the temperature of a client’s portfolio
  and advise them about everything from how to allocate incoming money to ways to
  minimize tax bills. Bottom line, these advisors measure the likelihood that a client’s
  portfolio will deliver long-term results -- a.k.a. not run out of money before they
  die.\n"

- "\tDon’t rely on guesswork to formulate an answer. You’ve followed all the financial
  rules-of-thumb to the letter -- diligently saving at least 10% of your income, maxing
  out your retirement savings accounts, avoiding high-interest debt, living below
  your means -- and assuming (or crossing your fingers) that you’ll be set for retirement
  and whatever life throws in your path until then.But how confident are you that
  you’re truly on track? Back-of-the-envelope calculations and simple online retirement
  calculators aren’t exactly the most reliable ways to ensure with confidence that
  you’re going to reach your goals. And do you really want to leave something this
  important up to guesswork?Will your money run out before you die? That may sound
  crass, but it’s the question that every investor needs to answer… with certainty.
  The only way to do that is to crunch the numbers and consider all of the potential
  scenarios. For example:You can’t really know if you’re saving enough for your future
  -- and saving in the right way -- until you put your investing plan through the
  paces by using historical returns and other reality-based scenarios.This is the
  kind of rigorous testing planners do for their high net worth clients. Using sophisticated
  calculations and modeling, they regularly take the temperature of a client’s portfolio
  and advise them about everything from how to allocate incoming money to ways to
  minimize tax bills. Bottom line, these advisors measure the likelihood that a client’s
  portfolio will deliver long-term results -- a.k.a. not run out of money before they
  die.These days you don’t need to have a $1 million, or even $100,000 portfolio to
  get a professional read on your portfolio and customized advice on how to tweak
  your current holdings so that you are on the right path. Thanks to automation and
  the widespread availability of low-cost indexing strategies, FutureAdvisor gives
  everyday investors access to the same management tools and advice.In just a few
  minutes you can see all of your investment accounts in one place. We’ll run a detailed
  screen of your existing holdings and evaluate everything you currently own.  We’ll
  then design a well-balanced, low-cost, risk-appropriate portfolio to get you on
  the best path to your goals -- at absolutely no cost to you. (If you decide to have
  us implement the plan -- which you can adjust further to customize to your needs
  -- we charge just 0.5% annually… and 401(k) advice is always free.)\n"

  followed all the financial rules-of-thumb to the letter -- diligently saving at
  least 10% of your income, maxing out your retirement savings accounts, avoiding
  high-interest debt, living below your means -- and assuming (or crossing your fingers)
  that you’ll be set for retirement and whatever life throws in your path until then.But
  how confident are you that you’re truly on track? Back-of-the-envelope calculations
  and simple online retirement calculators aren’t exactly the most reliable ways to
  ensure with confidence that you’re going to reach your goals. And do you really
  want to leave something this important up to guesswork?Accounting for All the “What
  Ifs”Will your money run out before you die? That may sound crass, but it’s the question
  that every investor needs to answer… with certainty. The only way to do that is
  to crunch the numbers and consider all of the potential scenarios. For example:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat
  if you or your spouse decides to exit the workforce for a while to raise children?What
  if stock market returns are lackluster for the next 10 years?How will higher education
  costs or caring for an elderly relative affect your investable resources?Exactly
  what income will be required in the future to provide the lifestyle you envision
  for you and your family?What areas of your portfolio are most vulnerable to market
  fluctuations?What if Social Security doesn’t provide the same level of benefits
  in the future?You can’t really know if you’re saving enough for your future -- and
  saving in the right way -- until you put your investing plan through the paces by
  using historical returns and other reality-based scenarios.This is the kind of rigorous
  testing planners do for their high net worth clients. Using sophisticated calculations
  and modeling, they regularly take the temperature of a client’s portfolio and advise
  them about everything from how to allocate incoming money to ways to minimize tax
  bills. Bottom line, these advisors measure the likelihood that a client’s portfolio
  will deliver long-term results -- a.k.a. not run out of money before they die.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet
