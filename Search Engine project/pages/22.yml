- |
  It was a favorite way to pass time with her dad, who taught her how to identify them. “The first job I ever remember wanting to have was discovering more constellations,” Miranda says. By the age of 10, she had a telescope, several astronomy books, and solid devotion to the study of the celestial world.
- |
  Now an undergraduate majoring in physics and astronomy at Indiana University Bloomington, Miranda finds herself looking at stars in a much larger context: 48 neighboring galaxies, to be specific. With her faculty research mentor Professor Liese van Zee, Miranda is studying star populations that help explain how and why galaxies evolve.Extragalactic explorer: Miranda and a small research team in Professor van Zee’s lab are studying stars in the Milky Way's neighboring galaxies.No obstacle too astronomicalGetting here wasn’t easy. An Indianapolis native, Miranda always envisioned coming to IU. But a high school experience made her question whether she should pursue astronomy. On her robotics team, she was “surrounded by guys who were going to be engineers”—and they noticed Miranda’s challenges with math. “They suggested I might not be cut out for a science career,” she says.
- |
  Taking that advice to heart, Miranda hadn’t decided on a major in her freshman year, which she spent at IUPUI. When she took a course in the planets—a subject she knew very well from her years of self-study—her dream was revived, and she was determined to overcome the math obstacle. “I’ve had to come at the problems from a different angle. It just takes some perseverance.” Before her sophomore year, she transferred to the Department of Astronomy at IU Bloomington.According to best estimates, there are at least 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe. It’s an enormous field—literally—and there is so much to understand, Miranda says. “You are so tiny and you don’t even know it. I have an existential crisis daily,” she jokes.Finding a mentor and more than a few starsWithin her first month on campus, Miranda was invited to apply for a CEWIT (Center of Excellence for Women in Technology) program at IU that pairs female professors with female freshmen and sophomores in mentor-mentee research relationships. She feels like she drew the long straw with Professor van Zee, who taught her everything, she says. “She is an incredibly smart woman who is looking at the question of how galaxies form and evolve. I have asked endless questions and she has answered all of them,” Miranda says.
- |
  Miranda “visualizes” the galaxies data for the research lab by doing “weird computer magic” to produce images that allow her team to better see heat, gasses, and whether stars are younger (blue in color) or older (red in color). “We can see a relative galaxy age from there,” she says. The research team is analyzing patterns and trends, and identifying whether a galaxy is growing new stars, dying out, or if it has collided with another galaxy in a gravitational mishap.As a person who was once terrified of coming to college, I want to tell other students that the professors at IU really care about students.Astronomer for lifeProfessor van Zee and Miranda have a regular meeting where they don’t talk at all about the lab, but instead discuss Miranda’s future opportunities for research and internships. “I’ve learned a lot about the astronomical community and what I might want to be doing,” Miranda says. She’s currently curious about the instrumentation side of astronomy—engineering the tools that allow researchers to better see the outer stretches of the universe. Wherever she lands, she knows it’s astronomy for life, and she’s excited about exploring the options.

  She’s also excited about spending more time exploring campus clubs and enjoying the many entertaining attractions in Bloomington, like the local Bleeding Heartland Roller Derby, where she is learning to skate. “They are ruthless. Ruthless,” she says. On the bucket list is helping out at the local children’s science museum, WonderLab. “Watching kids fall in love with science may be the coolest thing in the world.”See how IU prepares graduates for successRead more IU success stories

  know it. I have an existential crisis daily,” she jokes.Within her first month on
  campus, Miranda was invited to apply for a CEWIT (Center of Excellence for Women
  in Technology) program at IU that pairs female professors with female freshmen and
  sophomores in mentor-mentee research relationships. She feels like she drew the
  long straw with Professor van Zee, who taught her everything, she says. “She is
  an incredibly smart woman who is looking at the question of how galaxies form and
  evolve. I have asked endless questions and she has answered all of them,” Miranda
  says.Miranda “visualizes” the galaxies data for the research lab by doing “weird
  computer magic” to produce images that allow her team to better see heat, gasses,
  and whether stars are younger (blue in color) or older (red in color). “We can see
  a relative galaxy age from there,” she says. The research team is analyzing patterns
  and trends, and identifying whether a galaxy is growing new stars, dying out, or
  if it has collided with another galaxy in a gravitational mishap.As a person who
  was once terrified of coming to college, I want to tell other students that the
  professors at IU really care about students.Professor van Zee and Miranda have a
  regular meeting where they don’t talk at all about the lab, but instead discuss
  Miranda’s future opportunities for research and internships. “I’ve learned a lot
  about the astronomical community and what I might want to be doing,” Miranda says.
  She’s currently curious about the instrumentation side of astronomy—engineering
  the tools that allow researchers to better see the outer stretches of the universe.
  Wherever she lands, she knows it’s astronomy for life, and she’s excited about exploring
  the options.She’s also excited about spending more time exploring campus clubs and
  enjoying the many entertaining attractions in Bloomington, like the local Bleeding
  Heartland Roller Derby, where she is learning to skate. “They are ruthless. Ruthless,”
  she says. On the bucket list is helping out at the local children’s science museum,
  WonderLab. “Watching kids fall in love with science may be the coolest thing in
  the world.”Indiana University BloomingtonFulfilling the Promise\n"

  BarnettMiranda BarnettLooking at the evolution of galaxiesWhen she was a very little
  girl, Miranda Barnett liked to pick out constellations in the night sky.\nIt was
  a favorite way to pass time with her dad, who taught her how to identify them. “The
  first job I ever remember wanting to have was discovering more constellations,”
  Miranda says. By the age of 10, she had a telescope, several astronomy books, and
  solid devotion to the study of the celestial world.\nNow an undergraduate majoring
  in physics and astronomy at Indiana University Bloomington, Miranda finds herself
  looking at stars in a much larger context: 48 neighboring galaxies, to be specific.
  With her faculty research mentor Professor Liese van Zee, Miranda is studying star
  populations that help explain how and why galaxies evolve.Extragalactic explorer:
  Miranda and a small research team in Professor van Zee’s lab are studying stars
  in the Milky Way's neighboring galaxies.No obstacle too astronomicalGetting here
  wasn’t easy. An Indianapolis native, Miranda always envisioned coming to IU. But
  a high school experience made her question whether she should pursue astronomy.
  On her robotics team, she was “surrounded by guys who were going to be engineers”—and
  they noticed Miranda’s challenges with math. “They suggested I might not be cut
  out for a science career,” she says.\nTaking that advice to heart, Miranda hadn’t
  decided on a major in her freshman year, which she spent at IUPUI. When she took
  a course in the planets—a subject she knew very well from her years of self-study—her
  dream was revived, and she was determined to overcome the math obstacle. “I’ve had
  to come at the problems from a different angle. It just takes some perseverance.”
  Before her sophomore year, she transferred to the Department of Astronomy at IU
  Bloomington.According to best estimates, there are at least 100 billion galaxies
  in the observable universe. It’s an enormous field—literally—and there is so much
  to understand, Miranda says. “You are so tiny and you don’t even know it. I have
  an existential crisis daily,” she jokes.Finding a mentor and more than a few starsWithin
  her first month on campus, Miranda was invited to apply for a CEWIT (Center of Excellence
  for Women in Technology) program at IU that pairs female professors with female
  freshmen and sophomores in mentor-mentee research relationships. She feels like
  she drew the long straw with Professor van Zee, who taught her everything, she says.
  “She is an incredibly smart woman who is looking at the question of how galaxies
  form and evolve. I have asked endless questions and she has answered all of them,”
  Miranda says.\nMiranda “visualizes” the galaxies data for the research lab by doing
  “weird computer magic” to produce images that allow her team to better see heat,
  gasses, and whether stars are younger (blue in color) or older (red in color). “We
  can see a relative galaxy age from there,” she says. The research team is analyzing
  patterns and trends, and identifying whether a galaxy is growing new stars, dying
  out, or if it has collided with another galaxy in a gravitational mishap.As a person
  who was once terrified of coming to college, I want to tell other students that
  the professors at IU really care about students.Astronomer for lifeProfessor van
  Zee and Miranda have a regular meeting where they don’t talk at all about the lab,
  but instead discuss Miranda’s future opportunities for research and internships.
  “I’ve learned a lot about the astronomical community and what I might want to be
  doing,” Miranda says. She’s currently curious about the instrumentation side of
  astronomy—engineering the tools that allow researchers to better see the outer stretches
  of the universe. Wherever she lands, she knows it’s astronomy for life, and she’s
  excited about exploring the options.\nShe’s also excited about spending more time
  exploring campus clubs and enjoying the many entertaining attractions in Bloomington,
  like the local Bleeding Heartland Roller Derby, where she is learning to skate.
  “They are ruthless. Ruthless,” she says. On the bucket list is helping out at the
  local children’s science museum, WonderLab. “Watching kids fall in love with science
  may be the coolest thing in the world.”See how IU prepares graduates for successRead
