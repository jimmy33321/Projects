                  Capitol Hill lawmakers were scrambling Monday to squeeze their wish-list items into a massive spending bill, with the ability of the government to fund itself once again on the line in the face of a looming deadline.

                  Republican demands to lift a decades-long ban on exporting crude oil was emerging as a final negotiating hurdle. Top congressional lawmakers negotiated over the weekend to resolve other major sticking points, with government funding set to run out Wednesday at midnight.

                  Congress already had to pass a short-term extension after failing the meet its original Dec. 11 deadline. Another stopgap is possible if the oil-export demand or other hang-ups delay a final agreement -- though lawmakers expressed confidence over the weekend about having a final, $1.14 trillion omnibus spending bill by Tuesday.

                  The legislation’s other sticking points reportedly are on riders to the Dodd-Frank banking reform law and U.S. policy on allowing refugees into the country.

                  The spending bill is also connected to legislation to extend dozens of tax credits for groups across the political spectrum, sparking intense lobbying.

                  In return for lifting the four-decade-old oil-export ban, Democrats are seeking environmental concessions, including permanently extending tax credits for solar- and wind-energy production and reviving an environmental conservation fund.

                  They also are trying to block GOP efforts to roll back Obama administration environmental regulations, in the wake of the global pact reached Saturday in Paris to limit carbon emissions.

                  "There's been just a tremendous amount of Democrat pushback on all of the environmental provisions and other provisions," said Sen. John Hoeven.

                  Still, the North Dakota Republican said he was hopeful the provision lifting the crude-oil ban would survive last-stage talks.

                  White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that getting an agreement on the legislation would go faster if Republicans “relinquish their insistence about the inclusion of ideological riders.”

                  Various agreements were falling into place on the bill to extend tax benefits, said lobbyists following the talks.

                  They cited a tentative agreement to postpone the start of the so-called "Cadillac" tax on high-value health insurance plans under ObamaCare from 2018 to 2020.

                  There may also be a two-year pause in the existing 2.3 percent medical device tax, which is opposed by lawmakers in both parties.

                  But there was still significant uncertainty over the fate of those provisions and others and it was possible Congress could opt for more modest two-year extensions of most existing tax credits rather than a major package with permanent and long-range changes.

                  The ban on exporting crude oil was instituted during energy shortages of the 1970s, but Republicans, and some Democrats, say it's long outlived any usefulness. They note a boom in domestic energy production. Environmental groups and most Democrats counter that the main beneficiaries would be big oil companies.

- "\t\t\t\tCapitol Hill lawmakers were scrambling Monday to squeeze their wish-list
  items into a massive spending bill, with the ability of the government to fund itself
  once again on the line in the face of a looming deadline.Republican demands to lift
  a decades-long ban on exporting crude oil was emerging as a final negotiating hurdle.
  Top congressional lawmakers negotiated over the weekend to resolve other major sticking
  points, with government funding set to run out Wednesday at midnight.Congress already
  had to pass a short-term extension after failing the meet its original Dec. 11 deadline.
  Another stopgap is possible if the oil-export demand or other hang-ups delay a final
  agreement -- though lawmakers expressed confidence over the weekend about having
  a final, $1.14 trillion omnibus spending bill by Tuesday.The legislation’s other
  sticking points reportedly are on riders to the Dodd-Frank banking reform law and
  U.S. policy on allowing refugees into the country.The spending bill is also connected
  to legislation to extend dozens of tax credits for groups across the political spectrum,
  sparking intense lobbying.Reaching a final agreement on the spending bill now might
  take until the end of the week.In return for lifting the four-decade-old oil-export
  ban, Democrats are seeking environmental concessions, including permanently extending
  tax credits for solar- and wind-energy production and reviving an environmental
  conservation fund.They also are trying to block GOP efforts to roll back Obama administration
  environmental regulations, in the wake of the global pact reached Saturday in Paris
  to limit carbon emissions.\"There's been just a tremendous amount of Democrat pushback
  on all of the environmental provisions and other provisions,\" said Sen. John Hoeven.Still,
  the North Dakota Republican said he was hopeful the provision lifting the crude-oil
  ban would survive last-stage talks.    White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest
  said Monday that getting an agreement on the legislation would go faster if Republicans
  “relinquish their insistence about the inclusion of ideological riders.”Various
  agreements were falling into place on the bill to extend tax benefits, said lobbyists
  following the talks.They cited a tentative agreement to postpone the start of the
  so-called \"Cadillac\" tax on high-value health insurance plans under ObamaCare
  from 2018 to 2020.There may also be a two-year pause in the existing 2.3 percent
  medical device tax, which is opposed by lawmakers in both parties.But there was
  still significant uncertainty over the fate of those provisions and others and it
  was possible Congress could opt for more modest two-year extensions of most existing
  tax credits rather than a major package with permanent and long-range changes.The
  ban on exporting crude oil was instituted during energy shortages of the 1970s,
  but Republicans, and some Democrats, say it's long outlived any usefulness. They
  note a boom in domestic energy production. Environmental groups and most Democrats
  counter that the main beneficiaries would be big oil companies. The Associated Press

  \       \n        \n            \n                Capitol Hill lawmakers were scrambling
  Monday to squeeze their wish-list items into a massive spending bill, with the ability
  of the government to fund itself once again on the line in the face of a looming
  deadline.\n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                Republican
  demands to lift a decades-long ban on exporting crude oil was emerging as a final
  negotiating hurdle. Top congressional lawmakers negotiated over the weekend to resolve
  other major sticking points, with government funding set to run out Wednesday at
  midnight.\n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                Congress
  already had to pass a short-term extension after failing the meet its original Dec.
  11 deadline. Another stopgap is possible if the oil-export demand or other hang-ups
  delay a final agreement -- though lawmakers expressed confidence over the weekend
  about having a final, $1.14 trillion omnibus spending bill by Tuesday.\n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                The legislation’s other sticking
  points reportedly are on riders to the Dodd-Frank banking reform law and U.S. policy
  on allowing refugees into the country.\n                \n                \r\n\n
  \           \n                The spending bill is also connected to legislation
  to extend dozens of tax credits for groups across the political spectrum, sparking
  intense lobbying.\n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                Reaching
  a final agreement on the spending bill now might take until the end of the week.\n
  \               \n                \r\n\n            \n                In return
  for lifting the four-decade-old oil-export ban, Democrats are seeking environmental
  concessions, including permanently extending tax credits for solar- and wind-energy
  production and reviving an environmental conservation fund.\n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                They also are trying to block
  GOP efforts to roll back Obama administration environmental regulations, in the
  wake of the global pact reached Saturday in Paris to limit carbon emissions.\n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                \"There's been just a tremendous
  amount of Democrat pushback on all of the environmental provisions and other provisions,\"
  said Sen. John Hoeven.\n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                Still,
  the North Dakota Republican said he was hopeful the provision lifting the crude-oil
  ban would survive last-stage talks.    \n                \n                \r\n\n
  \           \n                White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday
  that getting an agreement on the legislation would go faster if Republicans “relinquish
  their insistence about the inclusion of ideological riders.”\n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                Various agreements were falling
  into place on the bill to extend tax benefits, said lobbyists following the talks.\n
  \               \n                \r\n\n            \n                They cited
  a tentative agreement to postpone the start of the so-called \"Cadillac\" tax on
  high-value health insurance plans under ObamaCare from 2018 to 2020.\n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                There may also be a two-year
  pause in the existing 2.3 percent medical device tax, which is opposed by lawmakers
  in both parties.\n                \n                \r\n\n            \n                But
  there was still significant uncertainty over the fate of those provisions and others
  and it was possible Congress could opt for more modest two-year extensions of most
  existing tax credits rather than a major package with permanent and long-range changes.\n
  \               \n                \r\n\n            \n                The ban on
  exporting crude oil was instituted during energy shortages of the 1970s, but Republicans,
  and some Democrats, say it's long outlived any usefulness. They note a boom in domestic
  energy production. Environmental groups and most Democrats counter that the main
  beneficiaries would be big oil companies. \n                \n                \r\n\n

  to squeeze their wish-list items into a massive spending bill, with the ability
  of the government to fund itself once again on the line in the face of a looming
  deadline.Republican demands to lift a decades-long ban on exporting crude oil was
  emerging as a final negotiating hurdle. Top congressional lawmakers negotiated over
  the weekend to resolve other major sticking points, with government funding set
  to run out Wednesday at midnight.Congress already had to pass a short-term extension
  after failing the meet its original Dec. 11 deadline. Another stopgap is possible
  if the oil-export demand or other hang-ups delay a final agreement -- though lawmakers
  expressed confidence over the weekend about having a final, $1.14 trillion omnibus
  spending bill by Tuesday.The legislation’s other sticking points reportedly are
  on riders to the Dodd-Frank banking reform law and U.S. policy on allowing refugees
  into the country.The spending bill is also connected to legislation to extend dozens
  of tax credits for groups across the political spectrum, sparking intense lobbying.Reaching
  a final agreement on the spending bill now might take until the end of the week.In
  return for lifting the four-decade-old oil-export ban, Democrats are seeking environmental
  concessions, including permanently extending tax credits for solar- and wind-energy
  production and reviving an environmental conservation fund.They also are trying
  to block GOP efforts to roll back Obama administration environmental regulations,
  in the wake of the global pact reached Saturday in Paris to limit carbon emissions.\"There's
  been just a tremendous amount of Democrat pushback on all of the environmental provisions
  and other provisions,\" said Sen. John Hoeven.Still, the North Dakota Republican
  said he was hopeful the provision lifting the crude-oil ban would survive last-stage
  talks.    White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that getting an agreement
  on the legislation would go faster if Republicans “relinquish their insistence about
  the inclusion of ideological riders.”Various agreements were falling into place
  on the bill to extend tax benefits, said lobbyists following the talks.They cited
  a tentative agreement to postpone the start of the so-called \"Cadillac\" tax on
  high-value health insurance plans under ObamaCare from 2018 to 2020.There may also
  be a two-year pause in the existing 2.3 percent medical device tax, which is opposed
  by lawmakers in both parties.But there was still significant uncertainty over the
  fate of those provisions and others and it was possible Congress could opt for more
  modest two-year extensions of most existing tax credits rather than a major package
  with permanent and long-range changes.The ban on exporting crude oil was instituted
  during energy shortages of the 1970s, but Republicans, and some Democrats, say it's
  long outlived any usefulness. They note a boom in domestic energy production. Environmental
  groups and most Democrats counter that the main beneficiaries would be big oil companies. The
