- "        Health minister Edwina Currie has provoked outrage by saying most of Britain's
  egg production is infected with the salmonella bacteria.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "Mrs Currie, MP for south Derbyshire, made her remarks during a television interview.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "She has angered farmers, politicians and egg producers, some of whom have been
  calling for her resignation and are threatening to sue.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "\"Most of the egg production in this country, sadly, is now affected with salmonella,\"
  she told reporters.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "Ministry of Agriculture ministers are reported to be extremely \"angry\" at her
  comments.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "A spokesman said more than 30 million eggs were consumed every day last year.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "'Highly irresponsible'\r\n"
- "This is compared to 26 outbreaks of salmonella reported during that time.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "Mrs Currie's officials in the Department of Health have been unable to provide
  evidence that most chickens are infected with salmonella.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "Her comments have incensed the farming industry and egg producers who are expecting
  a sharp fall in egg consumption as a result.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "The British Egg Industry Council said it was seeking legal advice on whether it
  could sue Mrs Currie over \"factually incorrect and highly irresponsible\" remarks.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "A spokesman said the risk of an egg being infected with salmonella was less than
  200 million to one.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "The National Farmers' Union said it might seek legal damages.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "Legal action\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "Mrs Currie has been unavailable for comment since her remarks were made.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "She has represented her constituency since 1983 and was made junior health minister
  in 1986.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "During her short time at the Department of Health, Mrs Currie has courted controversy
  with her outspoken opinions.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "She upset northerners when she claimed they were dying of \"ignorance and chips\".\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "And she was branded patronising and callous for advising the elderly to broach
  the winter months with a pair of long-johns.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "One of her most controversial remarks was on the subject of Aids.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "She said: \"Good Christian people who would not dream of misbehaving will not catch
  Aids.\"\r\n"

- "\t\t\t\t\n"
- "\t\t\t\tEdwina Currie initially received support from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
  and Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "She weathered the political storm for a further two weeks before mounting writs
  against her from the farming industry forced her resignation.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "As egg sales plummeted, the government was forced to offer a compensation package
  of millions of pounds to cover the cost of purchasing surplus eggs and for the slaughter
  of unwanted hens.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "Mrs Currie remained an MP for her constituency until she was ousted in the 1997
  General Election.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "She has carved out a lucrative career as both a novelist and a broadcaster.\r\n"
- "The publication of her autobiography in 2002 sensationally revealed she had a four

  \                       \n\t1988: Egg industry fury over salmonella claim\n        Health
  minister Edwina Currie has provoked outrage by saying most of Britain's egg production
  is infected with the salmonella bacteria.\r\n\r\nMrs Currie, MP for south Derbyshire,
  made her remarks during a television interview.\r\n\r\nShe has angered farmers,
  politicians and egg producers, some of whom have been calling for her resignation
  and are threatening to sue.\r\n\r\n\"Most of the egg production in this country,
  sadly, is now affected with salmonella,\" she told reporters.\r\n\r\nMinistry of
  Agriculture ministers are reported to be extremely \"angry\" at her comments.\r\n\r\nA
  spokesman said more than 30 million eggs were consumed every day last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Highly
  irresponsible'\r\nThis is compared to 26 outbreaks of salmonella reported during
  that time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs Currie's officials in the Department of Health have been
  unable to provide evidence that most chickens are infected with salmonella.\r\n\r\nHer
  comments have incensed the farming industry and egg producers who are expecting
  a sharp fall in egg consumption as a result.\r\n\r\nThe British Egg Industry Council
  said it was seeking legal advice on whether it could sue Mrs Currie over \"factually
  incorrect and highly irresponsible\" remarks.\r\n\r\nA spokesman said the risk of
  an egg being infected with salmonella was less than 200 million to one.\r\n\r\nThe
  National Farmers' Union said it might seek legal damages.\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal action\r\n\r\nMrs
  Currie has been unavailable for comment since her remarks were made.\r\n\r\nShe
  has represented her constituency since 1983 and was made junior health minister
  in 1986.\r\n\r\nDuring her short time at the Department of Health, Mrs Currie has
  courted controversy with her outspoken opinions.\r\n\r\nShe upset northerners when
  she claimed they were dying of \"ignorance and chips\".\r\n\r\nAnd she was branded
  patronising and callous for advising the elderly to broach the winter months with
  a pair of long-johns.\r\n\r\nOne of her most controversial remarks was on the subject
  of Aids.\r\n\r\nShe said: \"Good Christian people who would not dream of misbehaving
  will not catch Aids.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\t\n    \n  \n\n  E-mail this story to a friend

  health scare\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n        In Context\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEdwina
  Currie initially received support from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Health
  Secretary Kenneth Clarke.\r\n\r\nShe weathered the political storm for a further
  two weeks before mounting writs against her from the farming industry forced her
  resignation.\r\n\r\nAs egg sales plummeted, the government was forced to offer a
  compensation package of millions of pounds to cover the cost of purchasing surplus
  eggs and for the slaughter of unwanted hens.\r\n\r\nMrs Currie remained an MP for
  her constituency until she was ousted in the 1997 General Election.\r\n\r\nShe has
  carved out a lucrative career as both a novelist and a broadcaster.\r\nThe publication
  of her autobiography in 2002 sensationally revealed she had a four year affair with
  the former Prime Minister John Major in the late 1980s.\r\n\r\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n

  incorrect and highly irresponsible\" remarks.\r\n\r\nA spokesman said the risk of
  an egg being infected with salmonella was less than 200 million to one.\r\n\r\nThe
  National Farmers' Union said it might seek legal damages.\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal action\r\n\r\nMrs
  Currie has been unavailable for comment since her remarks were made.\r\n\r\nShe
  has represented her constituency since 1983 and was made junior health minister
  in 1986.\r\n\r\nDuring her short time at the Department of Health, Mrs Currie has
  courted controversy with her outspoken opinions.\r\n\r\nShe upset northerners when
  she claimed they were dying of \"ignorance and chips\".\r\n\r\nAnd she was branded
  patronising and callous for advising the elderly to broach the winter months with
  a pair of long-johns.\r\n\r\nOne of her most controversial remarks was on the subject
  of Aids.\r\n\r\nShe said: \"Good Christian people who would not dream of misbehaving
  will not catch Aids.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\t\n    She weathered the political storm for
  a further two weeks before mounting writs against her from the farming industry
  forced her resignation.\r\n\r\nAs egg sales plummeted, the government was forced
  to offer a compensation package of millions of pounds to cover the cost of purchasing
  surplus eggs and for the slaughter of unwanted hens.\r\n\r\nMrs Currie remained
  an MP for her constituency until she was ousted in the 1997 General Election.\r\n\r\nShe
  has carved out a lucrative career as both a novelist and a broadcaster.\r\nThe publication
  of her autobiography in 2002 sensationally revealed she had a four year affair with
  the former Prime Minister John Major in the late 1980s.\r\n\r\n"
