                  Mathematics, the science of structure, order, and relation that has evolved from elemental practices of counting, measuring, and describing the shapes of objects. It deals with logical reasoning and quantitative calculation, and its development has involved an increasing degree of idealization and abstraction of its subject matter. Since the 17th century, mathematics has been an indispensable adjunct to the physical sciences and technology, and in more recent times it has assumed a similar role in the quantitative aspects of the life sciences.In many cultures—under the stimulus of the needs of practical pursuits, such as commerce and agriculture—mathematics has developed far beyond basic counting. This growth has been greatest in societies complex enough to sustain these activities and to provide leisure for contemplation and the opportunity to build on the achievements of earlier mathematicians.All mathematical systems (for example, Euclidean geometry) are combinations of sets of axioms and of theorems that can be logically deduced from the axioms. Inquiries into the logical and philosophical basis of mathematics reduce to questions of whether the axioms of a given system ensure its completeness and its consistency. For full treatment of this aspect, see mathematics, foundations of.This article offers a history of mathematics from ancient times to the present. As a consequence of the exponential growth of science, most mathematics has developed since the 15th century ad, and it is a historical fact that from the 15th century to the late 20th century new developments in mathematics have been largely concentrated in Europe and North America. For these reasons the bulk of this article is devoted to European developments since 1500.This does not mean, however, that developments elsewhere have been unimportant. Indeed, to understand the history of mathematics in Europe, it is necessary to know its history at least in Mesopotamia and Egypt, in ancient Greece, and in Islamic civilization from the 9th to the 15th century. The way in which these civilizations influenced one another and the important direct contributions Greece and Islam made to later developments are discussed in the first parts of this article.India’s contributions to the development of contemporary mathematics were made through the considerable influence of Indian achievements on Islamic mathematics during its formative years. A separate article, South Asian mathematics, focuses on the early history of mathematics in the Indian subcontinent and the development there of the modern decimal place-value numeral system. The article East Asian mathematics covers the mostly independent development of mathematics in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.The substantive branches of mathematics are treated in several articles. See algebra; analysis; arithmetic; combinatorics; game theory; geometry; number theory; numerical analysis; optimization; probability theory; set theory; statistics; trigonometry.Ancient mathematical sourcesIt is important to be aware of the character of the sources for the study of the history of mathematics. The history of Mesopotamian and Egyptian mathematics is based on the extant original documents written by scribes. Although in the case of Egypt these documents are few, they are all of a type and leave little doubt that Egyptian mathematics was, on the whole, elementary and profoundly practical in its orientation. For Mesopotamian mathematics, on the other hand, there are a large number of clay tablets, which reveal mathematical achievements of a much higher order than those of the Egyptians. The tablets indicate that the Mesopotamians had a great deal of remarkable mathematical knowledge, although they offer no evidence that this knowledge was organized into a deductive system. Future research may reveal more about the early development of mathematics in Mesopotamia or about its influence on Greek mathematics, but it seems likely that this picture of Mesopotamian mathematics will stand.From the period before Alexander the Great, no Greek mathematical documents have been preserved except for fragmentary paraphrases, and, even for the subsequent period, it is well to remember that the oldest copies of Euclid’s Elements are in Byzantine manuscripts dating from the 10th century ad. This stands in complete contrast to the situation described above for Egyptian and Babylonian documents. Although in general outline the present account of Greek mathematics is secure, in such important matters as the origin of the axiomatic method, the pre-Euclidean theory of ratios, and the discovery of the conic sections, historians have given competing accounts based on fragmentary texts, quotations of early writings culled from nonmathematical sources, and a considerable amount of conjecture.Many important treatises from the early period of Islamic mathematics have not survived or have survived only in Latin translations, so that there are still many unanswered questions about the relationship between early Islamic mathematics and the mathematics of Greece and India. In addition, the amount of surviving material from later centuries is so large in comparison with that which has been studied that it is not yet possible to offer any sure judgment of what later Islamic mathematics did not contain, and therefore it is not yet possible to evaluate with any assurance what was original in European mathematics from the 11th to the 15th century.In modern times the invention of printing has largely solved the problem of obtaining secure texts and has allowed historians of mathematics to concentrate their editorial efforts on the correspondence or the unpublished works of mathematicians. However, the exponential growth of mathematics means that, for the period from the 19th century on, historians are able to treat only the major figures in any detail. In addition, there is, as the period gets nearer the present, the problem of perspective. Mathematics, like any other human activity, has its fashions, and the nearer one is to a given period, the more likely these fashions will look like the wave of the future. For this reason, the present article makes no attempt to assess the most recent developments in the subject.John L. BerggrenMathematics in ancient MesopotamiaUntil the 1920s it was commonly supposed that mathematics had its birth among the ancient Greeks. What was known of earlier traditions, such as the Egyptian as represented by the Rhind papyrus (edited for the first time only in 1877), offered at best a meagre precedent. This impression gave way to a very different view as Orientalists succeeded in deciphering and interpreting the technical materials from ancient Mesopotamia.Owing to the durability of the Mesopotamian scribes’ clay tablets, the surviving evidence of this culture is substantial. Existing specimens of mathematics represent all the major eras—the Sumerian kingdoms of the 3rd millennium bc, the Akkadian and Babylonian regimes (2nd millennium), and the empires of the Assyrians (early 1st millennium), Persians (6th through 4th centuries bc), and Greeks (3rd century bc to 1st century ad). The level of competence was already high as early as the Old Babylonian dynasty, the time of the lawgiver-king Hammurabi (c. 18th century bc), but after that there were few notable advances. The application of mathematics to astronomy, however, flourished during the Persian and Seleucid (Greek) periods.The numeral system and arithmetic operationsUnlike the Egyptians, the mathematicians of the Old Babylonian period went far beyond the immediate challenges of their official accounting duties. For example, they introduced a versatile numeral system, which, like the modern system, exploited the notion of place value, and they developed computational methods that took advantage of this means of expressing numbers; they solved linear and quadratic problems by methods much like those now used in algebra; their success with the study of what are now called Pythagorean number triples was a remarkable feat in number theory. The scribes who made such discoveries must have believed mathematics to be worthy of study in its own right, not just as a practical tool.The older Sumerian system of numerals followed an additive decimal (base-10) principle similar to that of the Egyptians. But the Old Babylonian system converted this into a place-value system with the base of 60 (sexagesimal). The reasons for the choice of 60 are obscure, but one good mathematical reason might have been the existence of so many divisors (2, 3, 4, and 5, and some multiples) of the base, which would have greatly facilitated the operation of division. For numbers from 1 to 59, the symbols  for 1 and  for 10 were combined in the simple additive manner (e.g.,  represented 32). But, to express larger values, the Babylonians applied the concept of place value: for example, 60 was written as , 70 as , 80 as , and so on. In fact,  could represent any power of 60. The context determined which power was intended. The Babylonians appear to have developed a placeholder symbol that functioned as a zero by the 3rd century bc, but its precise meaning and use is still uncertain. Furthermore, they had no mark to separate numbers into integral and fractional parts (as with the modern decimal point). Thus, the three-place numeral 3 7 30 could represent 31/8 (i.e., 3 + 7/60 + 30/602), 1871/2 (i.e., 3 × 60 + 7 + 30/60), 11,250 (i.e., 3 × 602 + 7 × 60 + 30), or a multiple of these numbers by any power of 60.The four arithmetic operations were performed in the same way as in the modern decimal system, except that carrying occurred whenever a sum reached 60 rather than 10. Multiplication was facilitated by means of tables; one typical tablet lists the multiples of a number by 1, 2, 3,…, 19, 20, 30, 40, and 50. To multiply two numbers several places long, the scribe first broke the problem down into several multiplications, each by a one-place number, and then looked up the value of each product in the appropriate tables. He found the answer to the problem by adding up these intermediate results. These tables also assisted in division, for the values that head them were all reciprocals of regular numbers.Regular numbers are those whose prime factors divide the base; the reciprocals of such numbers thus have only a finite number of places (by contrast, the reciprocals of nonregular numbers produce an infinitely repeating numeral). In base 10, for example, only numbers with factors of 2 and 5 (e.g., 8 or 50) are regular, and the reciprocals (1/8 = 0.125, 1/50 = 0.02) have finite expressions; but the reciprocals of other numbers (such as 3 and 7) repeat infinitely  and , respectively, where the bar indicates the digits that continually repeat). In base 60, only numbers with factors of 2, 3, and 5 are regular; for example, 6 and 54 are regular, so that their reciprocals (10 and 1 6 40) are finite. The entries in the multiplication table for 1 6 40 are thus simultaneously multiples of its reciprocal 1/54. To divide a number by any regular number, then, one can consult the table of multiples for its reciprocal.An interesting tablet in the collection of Yale University (see photograph) shows a square with its diagonals; on one side is written “30,” under one diagonal “42 25 35,” and right along the same diagonal “1 24 51 10” (i.e., 1 + 24/60 + 51/602 + 10/603). This third number is the correct value of √2 to four sexagesimal places (equivalent in the decimal system to 1.414213…, which is too low by only 1 in the seventh place), while the second number is the product of the third number and the first and so gives the length of the diagonal when the side is 30. The scribe thus appears to have known an equivalent of the familiar long method of finding square roots. An additional element of sophistication is that, by choosing 30 (that is, 1/2) for the side, the scribe obtained as the diagonal the reciprocal of the value of √2 (since √2/2 = 1/√2), a result useful for purposes of division.Geometric and algebraic problemsIn a Babylonian tablet now in Berlin, the diagonal of a rectangle of sides 40 and 10 is solved as 40 + 102/(2 × 40). Here a very effective approximating rule is being used (that the square root of the sum of a2 + b2 can be estimated as a + b2/2a), the same rule found frequently in later Greek geometric writings. Both these examples for roots illustrate the Babylonians’ arithmetic approach in geometry. They also show that the Babylonians were aware of the relation between the hypotenuse and the two legs of a right triangle (now commonly known as the Pythagorean theorem) more than a thousand years before the Greeks used it.A type of problem that occurs frequently in the Babylonian tablets seeks the base and height of a rectangle, where their product and sum have specified values. From the given information the scribe worked out the difference, since (b − h)2 = (b + h)2 − 4bh. In the same way, if the product and difference were given, the sum could be found. And, once both the sum and difference were known, each side could be determined, for 2b = (b + h) + (b − h) and 2h = (b + h) − (b − h). This procedure is equivalent to a solution of the general quadratic in one unknown. In some places, however, the Babylonian scribes solved quadratic problems in terms of a single unknown, just as would now be done by means of the quadratic formula.Although these Babylonian quadratic procedures have often been described as the earliest appearance of algebra, there are important distinctions. The scribes lacked an algebraic symbolism; although they must certainly have understood that their solution procedures were general, they always presented them in terms of particular cases, rather than as the working through of general formulas and identities. They thus lacked the means for presenting general derivations and proofs of their solution procedures. Their use of sequential procedures rather than formulas, however, is less likely to detract from an evaluation of their effort now that algorithmic methods much like theirs have become commonplace through the development of computers.As mentioned above, the Babylonian scribes knew that the base (b), height (h), and diagonal (d) of a rectangle satisfy the relation b2 + h2 = d2. If one selects values at random for two of the terms, the third will usually be irrational, but it is possible to find cases in which all three terms are integers: for example, 3, 4, 5 and 5, 12, 13. (Such solutions are sometimes called Pythagorean triples.) A tablet in the Columbia University Collection presents a list of 15 such triples (decimal equivalents are shown in parentheses at the right; the gaps in the expressions for h, b, and d separate the place values in the sexagesimal numerals):(The entries in the column for h have to be computed from the values for b and d, for they do not appear on the tablet; but they must once have existed on a portion now missing.) The ordering of the lines becomes clear from another column, listing the values of d2/h2 (brackets indicate figures that are lost or illegible), which form a continually decreasing sequence: [1 59 0] 15, [1 56 56] 58 14 50 6 15,…, [1] 23 13 46 40. Accordingly, the angle formed between the diagonal and the base in this sequence increases continually from just over 45° to just under 60°. Other properties of the sequence suggest that the scribe knew the general procedure for finding all such number triples—that for any integers p and q, 2d/h = p/q + q/p and 2b/h = p/q − q/p. (In the table the implied values p and q turn out to be regular numbers falling in the standard set of reciprocals, as mentioned earlier in connection with the multiplication tables.) Scholars are still debating nuances of the construction and the intended use of this table, but no one questions the high level of expertise implied by it.Mathematical astronomyThe sexagesimal method developed by the Babylonians has a far greater computational potential than what was actually needed for the older problem texts. With the development of mathematical astronomy in the Seleucid period, however, it became indispensable. Astronomers sought to predict future occurrences of important phenomena, such as lunar eclipses and critical points in planetary cycles (conjunctions, oppositions, stationary points, and first and last visibility). They devised a technique for computing these positions (expressed in terms of degrees of latitude and longitude, measured relative to the path of the Sun’s apparent annual motion) by successively adding appropriate terms in arithmetic progression. The results were then organized into a table listing positions as far ahead as the scribe chose. (Although the method is purely arithmetic, one can interpret it graphically: the tabulated values form a linear “zigzag” approximation to what is actually a sinusoidal variation.) While observations extending over centuries are required for finding the necessary parameters (e.g., periods, angular range between maximum and minimum values, and the like), only the computational apparatus at their disposal made the astronomers’ forecasting effort possible.Within a relatively short time (perhaps a century or less), the elements of this system came into the hands of the Greeks. Although Hipparchus (2nd century bc) favoured the geometric approach of his Greek predecessors, he took over parameters from the Mesopotamians and adopted their sexagesimal style of computation. Through the Greeks it passed to Arab scientists during the Middle Ages and thence to Europe, where it remained prominent in mathematical astronomy during the Renaissance and the early modern period. To this day it persists in the use of minutes and seconds to measure time and angles.Aspects of the Old Babylonian mathematics may have come to the Greeks even earlier, perhaps in the 5th century bc, the formative period of Greek geometry. There are a number of parallels that scholars have noted: for example, the Greek technique of “application of area” (see below Greek mathematics) corresponded to the Babylonian quadratic methods (although in a geometric, not arithmetic, form). Further, the Babylonian rule for estimating square roots was widely used in Greek geometric computations, and there may also have been some shared nuances of technical terminology. Although details of the timing and manner of such a transmission are obscure because of the absence of explicit documentation, it seems that Western mathematics, while stemming largely from the Greeks, is considerably indebted to the older Mesopotamians.Mathematics in ancient EgyptThe introduction of writing in Egypt in the predynastic period (c. 3000 bc) brought with it the formation of a special class of literate professionals, the scribes. By virtue of their writing skills, the scribes took on all the duties of a civil service: record keeping, tax accounting, the management of public works (building projects and the like), even the prosecution of war through overseeing military supplies and payrolls. Young men enrolled in scribal schools to learn the essentials of the trade, which included not only reading and writing but also the basics of mathematics.One of the texts popular as a copy exercise in the schools of the New Kingdom (13th century bc) was a satiric letter in which one scribe, Hori, taunts his rival, Amen-em-opet, for his incompetence as an adviser and manager. “You are the clever scribe at the head of the troops,” Hori chides at one point;a ramp is to be built, 730 cubits long, 55 cubits wide, with 120 compartments—it is 60 cubits high, 30 cubits in the middle…and the generals and the scribes turn to you and say, “You are a clever scribe, your name is famous. Is there anything you don’t know? Answer us, how many bricks are needed?” Let each compartment be 30 cubits by 7 cubits.This problem, and three others like it in the same letter, cannot be solved without further data. But the point of the humour is clear, as Hori challenges his rival with these hard, but typical, tasks.What is known of Egyptian mathematics tallies well with the tests posed by the scribe Hori. The information comes primarily from two long papyrus documents that once served as textbooks within scribal schools. The Rhind papyrus (in the British Museum) is a copy made in the 17th century bc of a text two centuries older still. In it is found a long table of fractional parts to help with division, followed by the solutions of 84 specific problems in arithmetic and geometry. The Golenishchev papyrus (in the Moscow Museum of Fine Arts), dating from the 19th century bc, presents 25 problems of a similar type. These problems reflect well the functions the scribes would perform, for they deal with how to distribute beer and bread as wages, for example, and how to measure the areas of fields as well as the volumes of pyramids and other solids.The numeral system and arithmetic operationsThe Egyptians, like the Romans after them, expressed numbers according to a decimal scheme, using separate symbols for 1, 10, 100, 1,000, and so on; each symbol appeared in the expression for a number as many times as the value it represented occurred in the number itself. For example,  stood for 24. This rather cumbersome notation was used within the hieroglyphic writing (see the figure) found in stone inscriptions and other formal texts, but in the papyrus documents the scribes employed a more convenient abbreviated script, called hieratic writing (see the figure), where, for example, 24 was written .In such a system, addition and subtraction amount to counting how many symbols of each kind there are in the numerical expressions and then rewriting with the resulting number of symbols. The texts that survive do not reveal what, if any, special procedures the scribes used to assist in this. But for multiplication they introduced a method of successive doubling. For example, to multiply 28 by 11, one constructs a table of multiples of 28 like the following:The several entries in the first column that together sum to 11 (i.e., 8, 2, and 1) are checked off. The product is then found by adding up the multiples corresponding to these entries; thus, 224 + 56 + 28 = 308, the desired product.To divide 308 by 28, the Egyptians applied the same procedure in reverse. Using the same table as in the multiplication problem, one can see that 8 produces the largest multiple of 28 that is less then 308 (for the entry at 16 is already 448), and 8 is checked off. The process is then repeated, this time for the remainder (84) obtained by subtracting the entry at 8 (224) from the original number (308). This, however, is already smaller than the entry at 4, which consequently is ignored, but it is greater than the entry at 2 (56), which is then checked off. The process is repeated again for the remainder obtained by subtracting 56 from the previous remainder of 84, or 28, which also happens to exactly equal the entry at 1 and which is then checked off. The entries that have been checked off are added up, yielding the quotient: 8 + 2 + 1 = 11. (In most cases, of course, there is a remainder that is less than the divisor.)For larger numbers this procedure can be improved by considering multiples of one of the factors by 10, 20,…or even by higher orders of magnitude (100, 1,000,…), as necessary (in the Egyptian decimal notation, these multiples are easy to work out). Thus, one can find the product of 28 by 27 by setting out the multiples of 28 by 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, and 20. Since the entries 1, 2, 4, and 20 add up to 27, one has only to add up the corresponding multiples to find the answer.Computations involving fractions are carried out under the restriction to unit parts (that is, fractions that in modern notation are written with 1 as the numerator). To express the result of dividing 4 by 7, for instance, which in modern notation is simply 4/7, the scribe wrote 1/2 + 1/14. The procedure for finding quotients in this form merely extends the usual method for the division of integers, where one now inspects the entries for 2/3, 1/3, 1/6, etc., and 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, etc., until the corresponding multiples of the divisor sum to the dividend. (The scribes included 2/3, one may observe, even though it is not a unit fraction.) In practice the procedure can sometimes become quite complicated (for example, the value for 2/29 is given in the Rhind papyrus as 1/24 + 1/58 + 1/174 + 1/232) and can be worked out in different ways (for example, the same 2/29 might be found as 1/15 + 1/435 or as 1/16 + 1/232 + 1/464, etc.). A considerable portion of the papyrus texts is devoted to tables to facilitate the finding of such unit-fraction values.These elementary operations are all that one needs for solving the arithmetic problems in the papyri. For example, “to divide 6 loaves among 10 men” (Rhind papyrus, problem 3), one merely divides to get the answer 1/2 + 1/10. In one group of problems an interesting trick is used: “A quantity (aha) and its 7th together make 19—what is it?” (Rhind papyrus, problem 24). Here one first supposes the quantity to be 7: since 11/7 of it becomes 8, not 19, one takes 19/8 (that is, 2 + 1/4 + 1/8), and its multiple by 7 (16 + 1/2 + 1/8) becomes the required answer. This type of procedure (sometimes called the method of “false position” or “false assumption”) is familiar in many other arithmetic traditions (e.g., the Chinese, Hindu, Muslim, and Renaissance European), although they appear to have no direct link to the Egyptian.GeometryThe geometric problems in the papyri seek measurements of figures, like rectangles and triangles of given base and height, by means of suitable arithmetic operations. In a more complicated problem, a rectangle is sought whose area is 12 and whose height is 1/2 + 1/4 times its base (Golenishchev papyrus, problem 6). To solve the problem, the ratio is inverted and multiplied by the area, yielding 16; the square root of the result (4) is the base of the rectangle, and 1/2 + 1/4 times 4, or 3, is the height. The entire process is analogous to the process of solving the algebraic equation for the problem (x × 3/4x = 12), though without the use of a letter for the unknown. An interesting procedure is used to find the area of the circle (Rhind papyrus, problem 50): 1/9 of the diameter is discarded, and the result is squared. For example, if the diameter is 9, the area is set equal to 64. The scribe recognized that the area of a circle is proportional to the square of the diameter and assumed for the constant of proportionality (that is, π/4) the value 64/81. This is a rather good estimate, being about 0.6 percent too large. (It is not as close, however, as the now common estimate of 31/7, first proposed by Archimedes, which is only about 0.04 percent too large.) But there is nothing in the papyri indicating that the scribes were aware that this rule was only approximate rather than exact.A remarkable result is the rule for the volume of the truncated pyramid (Golenishchev papyrus, problem 14). The scribe assumes the height to be 6, the base to be a square of side 4, and the top a square of side 2. He multiplies one-third the height times 28, finding the volume to be 56; here 28 is computed from 2 × 2 + 2 × 4 + 4 × 4. Since this is correct, it can be assumed that the scribe also knew the general rule: A = (h/3)(a2 + ab + b2). How the scribes actually derived the rule is a matter for debate, but it is reasonable to suppose that they were aware of related rules, such as that for the volume of a pyramid: one-third the height times the area of the base.The Egyptians employed the equivalent of similar triangles to measure distances. For instance, the seked of a pyramid is stated as the number of palms in the horizontal corresponding to a rise of one cubit (seven palms). (See the figure.) Thus, if the seked is 51/4 and the base is 140 cubits, the height becomes 931/3 cubits (Rhind papyrus, problem 57). The Greek sage Thales of Miletus (6th century bc) is said to have measured the height of pyramids by means of their shadows (the report derives from Hieronymus, a disciple of Aristotle in the 4th century bc). In light of the seked computations, however, this report must indicate an aspect of Egyptian surveying that extended back at least 1,000 years before the time of Thales.Assessment of Egyptian mathematicsThe papyri thus bear witness to a mathematical tradition closely tied to the practical accounting and surveying activities of the scribes. Occasionally, the scribes loosened up a bit: one problem (Rhind papyrus, problem 79), for example, seeks the total from seven houses, seven cats per house, seven mice per cat, seven ears of wheat per mouse, and seven hekat of grain per ear (result: 19,607). Certainly the scribe’s interest in progressions (for which he appears to have a rule) goes beyond practical considerations. Other than this, however, Egyptian mathematics falls firmly within the range of practice.Even allowing for the scantiness of the documentation that survives, the Egyptian achievement in mathematics must be viewed as modest. Its most striking features are competence and continuity. The scribes managed to work out the basic arithmetic and geometry necessary for their official duties as civil managers, and their methods persisted with little evident change for at least a millennium, perhaps two. Indeed, when Egypt came under Greek domination in the Hellenistic period (from the 3rd century bc onward), the older school methods continued. Quite remarkably, the older unit-fraction methods are still prominent in Egyptian school papyri written in the demotic (Egyptian) and Greek languages as late as the 7th century ad, for example.To the extent that Egyptian mathematics left a legacy at all, it was through its impact on the emerging Greek mathematical tradition between the 6th and 4th centuries bc. Because the documentation from this period is limited, the manner and significance of the influence can only be conjectured. But the report about Thales measuring the height of pyramids is only one of several such accounts of Greek intellectuals learning from Egyptians; Herodotus and Plato describe with approval Egyptian practices in the teaching and application of mathematics. This literary evidence has historical support, since the Greeks maintained continuous trade and military operations in Egypt from the 7th century bc onward. It is thus plausible that basic precedents for the Greeks’ earliest mathematical efforts—how they dealt with fractional parts or measured areas and volumes, or their use of ratios in connection with similar figures—came from the learning of the ancient Egyptian scribes.

- "    Mathematics, the science of structure, order, and relation that has evolved
  from elemental practices of counting, measuring, and describing the shapes of objects.
  It deals with logical reasoning and quantitative calculation, and its development
  has involved an increasing degree of idealization and abstraction of its subject
  matter. Since the 17th century, mathematics has been an indispensable adjunct to
  the physical sciences and technology, and in more recent times it has assumed a
  similar role in the quantitative aspects of the life sciences.In many cultures—under
  the stimulus of the needs of practical pursuits, such as commerce and agriculture—mathematics
  has developed far beyond basic counting. This growth has been greatest in societies
  complex enough to sustain these activities and to provide leisure for contemplation
  and the opportunity to build on the achievements of earlier mathematicians.All mathematical
  systems (for example, Euclidean geometry) are combinations of sets of axioms and
  of theorems that can be logically deduced from the axioms. Inquiries into the logical
  and philosophical basis of mathematics reduce to questions of whether the axioms
  of a given system ensure its completeness and its consistency. For full treatment
  of this aspect, see mathematics, foundations of.This article offers a history of
  mathematics from ancient times to the present. As a consequence of the exponential
  growth of science, most mathematics has developed since the 15th century ad, and
  it is a historical fact that from the 15th century to the late 20th century new
  developments in mathematics have been largely concentrated in Europe and North America.
  For these reasons the bulk of this article is devoted to European developments since
  1500.This does not mean, however, that developments elsewhere have been unimportant.
  Indeed, to understand the history of mathematics in Europe, it is necessary to know
  its history at least in Mesopotamia and Egypt, in ancient Greece, and in Islamic
  civilization from the 9th to the 15th century. The way in which these civilizations
  influenced one another and the important direct contributions Greece and Islam made
  to later developments are discussed in the first parts of this article.India’s contributions
  to the development of contemporary mathematics were made through the considerable
  influence of Indian achievements on Islamic mathematics during its formative years.
  A separate article, South Asian mathematics, focuses on the early history of mathematics
  in the Indian subcontinent and the development there of the modern decimal place-value
  numeral system. The article East Asian mathematics covers the mostly independent
  development of mathematics in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.The substantive branches
  of mathematics are treated in several articles. See algebra; analysis; arithmetic;
  combinatorics; game theory; geometry; number theory; numerical analysis; optimization;
  probability theory; set theory; statistics; trigonometry.It is important to be aware
  of the character of the sources for the study of the history of mathematics. The
  history of Mesopotamian and Egyptian mathematics is based on the extant original
  documents written by scribes. Although in the case of Egypt these documents are
  few, they are all of a type and leave little doubt that Egyptian mathematics was,
  on the whole, elementary and profoundly practical in its orientation. For Mesopotamian
  mathematics, on the other hand, there are a large number of clay tablets, which
  reveal mathematical achievements of a much higher order than those of the Egyptians.
  The tablets indicate that the Mesopotamians had a great deal of remarkable mathematical
  knowledge, although they offer no evidence that this knowledge was organized into
  a deductive system. Future research may reveal more about the early development
  of mathematics in Mesopotamia or about its influence on Greek mathematics, but it
  seems likely that this picture of Mesopotamian mathematics will stand.From the period
  before Alexander the Great, no Greek mathematical documents have been preserved
  except for fragmentary paraphrases, and, even for the subsequent period, it is well
  to remember that the oldest copies of Euclid’s Elements are in Byzantine manuscripts
  dating from the 10th century ad. This stands in complete contrast to the situation
  described above for Egyptian and Babylonian documents. Although in general outline
  the present account of Greek mathematics is secure, in such important matters as
  the origin of the axiomatic method, the pre-Euclidean theory of ratios, and the
  discovery of the conic sections, historians have given competing accounts based
  on fragmentary texts, quotations of early writings culled from nonmathematical sources,
  and a considerable amount of conjecture.Many important treatises from the early
  period of Islamic mathematics have not survived or have survived only in Latin translations,
  so that there are still many unanswered questions about the relationship between
  early Islamic mathematics and the mathematics of Greece and India. In addition,
  the amount of surviving material from later centuries is so large in comparison
  with that which has been studied that it is not yet possible to offer any sure judgment
  of what later Islamic mathematics did not contain, and therefore it is not yet possible
  to evaluate with any assurance what was original in European mathematics from the
  11th to the 15th century.In modern times the invention of printing has largely solved
  the problem of obtaining secure texts and has allowed historians of mathematics
  to concentrate their editorial efforts on the correspondence or the unpublished
  works of mathematicians. However, the exponential growth of mathematics means that,
  for the period from the 19th century on, historians are able to treat only the major
  figures in any detail. In addition, there is, as the period gets nearer the present,
  the problem of perspective. Mathematics, like any other human activity, has its
  fashions, and the nearer one is to a given period, the more likely these fashions
  will look like the wave of the future. For this reason, the present article makes
  no attempt to assess the most recent developments in the subject.Until the 1920s
  it was commonly supposed that mathematics had its birth among the ancient Greeks.
  What was known of earlier traditions, such as the Egyptian as represented by the
  Rhind papyrus (edited for the first time only in 1877), offered at best a meagre
  precedent. This impression gave way to a very different view as Orientalists succeeded
  in deciphering and interpreting the technical materials from ancient Mesopotamia.Owing
  to the durability of the Mesopotamian scribes’ clay tablets, the surviving evidence
  of this culture is substantial. Existing specimens of mathematics represent all
  the major eras—the Sumerian kingdoms of the 3rd millennium bc, the Akkadian and
  Babylonian regimes (2nd millennium), and the empires of the Assyrians (early 1st
  millennium), Persians (6th through 4th centuries bc), and Greeks (3rd century bc
  to 1st century ad). The level of competence was already high as early as the Old
  Babylonian dynasty, the time of the lawgiver-king Hammurabi (c. 18th century bc),
  but after that there were few notable advances. The application of mathematics to
  astronomy, however, flourished during the Persian and Seleucid (Greek) periods.Unlike
  the Egyptians, the mathematicians of the Old Babylonian period went far beyond the
  immediate challenges of their official accounting duties. For example, they introduced
  a versatile numeral system, which, like the modern system, exploited the notion
  of place value, and they developed computational methods that took advantage of
  this means of expressing numbers; they solved linear and quadratic problems by methods
  much like those now used in algebra; their success with the study of what are now
  called Pythagorean number triples was a remarkable feat in number theory. The scribes
  who made such discoveries must have believed mathematics to be worthy of study in
  its own right, not just as a practical tool.The older Sumerian system of numerals
  followed an additive decimal (base-10) principle similar to that of the Egyptians.
  But the Old Babylonian system converted this into a place-value system with the
  base of 60 (sexagesimal). The reasons for the choice of 60 are obscure, but one
  good mathematical reason might have been the existence of so many divisors (2, 3,
  4, and 5, and some multiples) of the base, which would have greatly facilitated
  the operation of division. For numbers from 1 to 59, the symbols  for 1 and  for
  10 were combined in the simple additive manner (e.g.,  represented 32). But, to
  express larger values, the Babylonians applied the concept of place value: for example,
  60 was written as , 70 as , 80 as , and so on. In fact,  could represent any power
  of 60. The context determined which power was intended. The Babylonians appear to
  have developed a placeholder symbol that functioned as a zero by the 3rd century
  bc, but its precise meaning and use is still uncertain. Furthermore, they had no
  mark to separate numbers into integral and fractional parts (as with the modern
  decimal point). Thus, the three-place numeral 3 7 30 could represent 31/8 (i.e.,
  3 + 7/60 + 30/602), 1871/2 (i.e., 3 × 60 + 7 + 30/60), 11,250 (i.e., 3 × 602 + 7 × 60 + 30),
  or a multiple of these numbers by any power of 60.The four arithmetic operations
  were performed in the same way as in the modern decimal system, except that carrying
  occurred whenever a sum reached 60 rather than 10. Multiplication was facilitated
  by means of tables; one typical tablet lists the multiples of a number by 1, 2,
  3,…, 19, 20, 30, 40, and 50. To multiply two numbers several places long, the scribe
  first broke the problem down into several multiplications, each by a one-place number,
  and then looked up the value of each product in the appropriate tables. He found
  the answer to the problem by adding up these intermediate results. These tables
  also assisted in division, for the values that head them were all reciprocals of
  regular numbers.Regular numbers are those whose prime factors divide the base; the
  reciprocals of such numbers thus have only a finite number of places (by contrast,
  the reciprocals of nonregular numbers produce an infinitely repeating numeral).
  In base 10, for example, only numbers with factors of 2 and 5 (e.g., 8 or 50) are
  regular, and the reciprocals (1/8 = 0.125, 1/50 = 0.02) have finite expressions;
  but the reciprocals of other numbers (such as 3 and 7) repeat infinitely  and ,
  respectively, where the bar indicates the digits that continually repeat). In base
  60, only numbers with factors of 2, 3, and 5 are regular; for example, 6 and 54
  are regular, so that their reciprocals (10 and 1 6 40) are finite. The entries in
  the multiplication table for 1 6 40 are thus simultaneously multiples of its reciprocal
  1/54. To divide a number by any regular number, then, one can consult the table
  of multiples for its reciprocal.An interesting tablet in the collection of Yale
  University (see photograph) shows a square with its diagonals; on one side is written
  “30,” under one diagonal “42 25 35,” and right along the same diagonal “1 24 51
  10” (i.e., 1 + 24/60 + 51/602 + 10/603). This third number is the correct value
  of √2 to four sexagesimal places (equivalent in the decimal system to 1.414213…,
  which is too low by only 1 in the seventh place), while the second number is the
  product of the third number and the first and so gives the length of the diagonal
  when the side is 30. The scribe thus appears to have known an equivalent of the
  familiar long method of finding square roots. An additional element of sophistication
  is that, by choosing 30 (that is, 1/2) for the side, the scribe obtained as the
  diagonal the reciprocal of the value of √2 (since √2/2 = 1/√2), a result useful
  for purposes of division.In a Babylonian tablet now in Berlin, the diagonal of a
  rectangle of sides 40 and 10 is solved as 40 + 102/(2 × 40). Here a very effective
  approximating rule is being used (that the square root of the sum of a2 + b2 can
  be estimated as a + b2/2a), the same rule found frequently in later Greek geometric
  writings. Both these examples for roots illustrate the Babylonians’ arithmetic approach
  in geometry. They also show that the Babylonians were aware of the relation between
  the hypotenuse and the two legs of a right triangle (now commonly known as the Pythagorean
  theorem) more than a thousand years before the Greeks used it.A type of problem
  that occurs frequently in the Babylonian tablets seeks the base and height of a
  rectangle, where their product and sum have specified values. From the given information
  the scribe worked out the difference, since (b − h)2 = (b + h)2 − 4bh. In the same
  way, if the product and difference were given, the sum could be found. And, once
  both the sum and difference were known, each side could be determined, for 2b = (b + h) + (b − h)
  and 2h = (b + h) − (b − h). This procedure is equivalent to a solution of the general
  quadratic in one unknown. In some places, however, the Babylonian scribes solved
  quadratic problems in terms of a single unknown, just as would now be done by means
  of the quadratic formula.Although these Babylonian quadratic procedures have often
  been described as the earliest appearance of algebra, there are important distinctions.
  The scribes lacked an algebraic symbolism; although they must certainly have understood
  that their solution procedures were general, they always presented them in terms
  of particular cases, rather than as the working through of general formulas and
  identities. They thus lacked the means for presenting general derivations and proofs
  of their solution procedures. Their use of sequential procedures rather than formulas,
  however, is less likely to detract from an evaluation of their effort now that algorithmic
  methods much like theirs have become commonplace through the development of computers.As
  mentioned above, the Babylonian scribes knew that the base (b), height (h), and
  diagonal (d) of a rectangle satisfy the relation b2 + h2 = d2. If one selects values
  at random for two of the terms, the third will usually be irrational, but it is
  possible to find cases in which all three terms are integers: for example, 3, 4,
  5 and 5, 12, 13. (Such solutions are sometimes called Pythagorean triples.) A tablet
  in the Columbia University Collection presents a list of 15 such triples (decimal
  equivalents are shown in parentheses at the right; the gaps in the expressions for
  h, b, and d separate the place values in the sexagesimal numerals):(The entries
  in the column for h have to be computed from the values for b and d, for they do
  not appear on the tablet; but they must once have existed on a portion now missing.)
  The ordering of the lines becomes clear from another column, listing the values
  of d2/h2 (brackets indicate figures that are lost or illegible), which form a continually
  decreasing sequence: [1 59 0] 15, [1 56 56] 58 14 50 6 15,…, [1] 23 13 46 40. Accordingly,
  the angle formed between the diagonal and the base in this sequence increases continually
  from just over 45° to just under 60°. Other properties of the sequence suggest that
  the scribe knew the general procedure for finding all such number triples—that for
  any integers p and q, 2d/h = p/q + q/p and 2b/h = p/q − q/p. (In the table the implied
  values p and q turn out to be regular numbers falling in the standard set of reciprocals,
  as mentioned earlier in connection with the multiplication tables.) Scholars are
  still debating nuances of the construction and the intended use of this table, but
  no one questions the high level of expertise implied by it.The sexagesimal method
  developed by the Babylonians has a far greater computational potential than what
  was actually needed for the older problem texts. With the development of mathematical
  astronomy in the Seleucid period, however, it became indispensable. Astronomers
  sought to predict future occurrences of important phenomena, such as lunar eclipses
  and critical points in planetary cycles (conjunctions, oppositions, stationary points,
  and first and last visibility). They devised a technique for computing these positions
  (expressed in terms of degrees of latitude and longitude, measured relative to the
  path of the Sun’s apparent annual motion) by successively adding appropriate terms
  in arithmetic progression. The results were then organized into a table listing
  positions as far ahead as the scribe chose. (Although the method is purely arithmetic,
  one can interpret it graphically: the tabulated values form a linear “zigzag” approximation
  to what is actually a sinusoidal variation.) While observations extending over centuries
  are required for finding the necessary parameters (e.g., periods, angular range
  between maximum and minimum values, and the like), only the computational apparatus
  at their disposal made the astronomers’ forecasting effort possible.Within a relatively
  short time (perhaps a century or less), the elements of this system came into the
  hands of the Greeks. Although Hipparchus (2nd century bc) favoured the geometric
  approach of his Greek predecessors, he took over parameters from the Mesopotamians
  and adopted their sexagesimal style of computation. Through the Greeks it passed
  to Arab scientists during the Middle Ages and thence to Europe, where it remained
  prominent in mathematical astronomy during the Renaissance and the early modern
  period. To this day it persists in the use of minutes and seconds to measure time
  and angles.Aspects of the Old Babylonian mathematics may have come to the Greeks
  even earlier, perhaps in the 5th century bc, the formative period of Greek geometry.
  There are a number of parallels that scholars have noted: for example, the Greek
  technique of “application of area” (see below Greek mathematics) corresponded to
  the Babylonian quadratic methods (although in a geometric, not arithmetic, form).
  Further, the Babylonian rule for estimating square roots was widely used in Greek
  geometric computations, and there may also have been some shared nuances of technical
  terminology. Although details of the timing and manner of such a transmission are
  obscure because of the absence of explicit documentation, it seems that Western
  mathematics, while stemming largely from the Greeks, is considerably indebted to
  the older Mesopotamians.The introduction of writing in Egypt in the predynastic
  period (c. 3000 bc) brought with it the formation of a special class of literate
  professionals, the scribes. By virtue of their writing skills, the scribes took
  on all the duties of a civil service: record keeping, tax accounting, the management
  of public works (building projects and the like), even the prosecution of war through
  overseeing military supplies and payrolls. Young men enrolled in scribal schools
  to learn the essentials of the trade, which included not only reading and writing
  but also the basics of mathematics.One of the texts popular as a copy exercise in
  the schools of the New Kingdom (13th century bc) was a satiric letter in which one
  scribe, Hori, taunts his rival, Amen-em-opet, for his incompetence as an adviser
  and manager. “You are the clever scribe at the head of the troops,” Hori chides
  at one point;a ramp is to be built, 730 cubits long, 55 cubits wide, with 120 compartments—it
  is 60 cubits high, 30 cubits in the middle…and the generals and the scribes turn
  to you and say, “You are a clever scribe, your name is famous. Is there anything
  you don’t know? Answer us, how many bricks are needed?” Let each compartment be
  30 cubits by 7 cubits.This problem, and three others like it in the same letter,
  cannot be solved without further data. But the point of the humour is clear, as
  Hori challenges his rival with these hard, but typical, tasks.What is known of Egyptian
  mathematics tallies well with the tests posed by the scribe Hori. The information
  comes primarily from two long papyrus documents that once served as textbooks within
  scribal schools. The Rhind papyrus (in the British Museum) is a copy made in the
  17th century bc of a text two centuries older still. In it is found a long table
  of fractional parts to help with division, followed by the solutions of 84 specific
  problems in arithmetic and geometry. The Golenishchev papyrus (in the Moscow Museum
  of Fine Arts), dating from the 19th century bc, presents 25 problems of a similar
  type. These problems reflect well the functions the scribes would perform, for they
  deal with how to distribute beer and bread as wages, for example, and how to measure
  the areas of fields as well as the volumes of pyramids and other solids.The Egyptians,
  like the Romans after them, expressed numbers according to a decimal scheme, using
  separate symbols for 1, 10, 100, 1,000, and so on; each symbol appeared in the expression
  for a number as many times as the value it represented occurred in the number itself.
  For example,  stood for 24. This rather cumbersome notation was used within the
  hieroglyphic writing (see the figure) found in stone inscriptions and other formal
  texts, but in the papyrus documents the scribes employed a more convenient abbreviated
  script, called hieratic writing (see the figure), where, for example, 24 was written
  .In such a system, addition and subtraction amount to counting how many symbols
  of each kind there are in the numerical expressions and then rewriting with the
  resulting number of symbols. The texts that survive do not reveal what, if any,
  special procedures the scribes used to assist in this. But for multiplication they
  introduced a method of successive doubling. For example, to multiply 28 by 11, one
  constructs a table of multiples of 28 like the following:The several entries in
  the first column that together sum to 11 (i.e., 8, 2, and 1) are checked off. The
  product is then found by adding up the multiples corresponding to these entries;
  thus, 224 + 56 + 28 = 308, the desired product.To divide 308 by 28, the Egyptians
  applied the same procedure in reverse. Using the same table as in the multiplication
  problem, one can see that 8 produces the largest multiple of 28 that is less then
  308 (for the entry at 16 is already 448), and 8 is checked off. The process is then
  repeated, this time for the remainder (84) obtained by subtracting the entry at
  8 (224) from the original number (308). This, however, is already smaller than the
  entry at 4, which consequently is ignored, but it is greater than the entry at 2
  (56), which is then checked off. The process is repeated again for the remainder
  obtained by subtracting 56 from the previous remainder of 84, or 28, which also
  happens to exactly equal the entry at 1 and which is then checked off. The entries
  that have been checked off are added up, yielding the quotient: 8 + 2 + 1 = 11.
  (In most cases, of course, there is a remainder that is less than the divisor.)For
  larger numbers this procedure can be improved by considering multiples of one of
  the factors by 10, 20,…or even by higher orders of magnitude (100, 1,000,…), as
  necessary (in the Egyptian decimal notation, these multiples are easy to work out).
  Thus, one can find the product of 28 by 27 by setting out the multiples of 28 by
  1, 2, 4, 8, 10, and 20. Since the entries 1, 2, 4, and 20 add up to 27, one has
  only to add up the corresponding multiples to find the answer.Computations involving
  fractions are carried out under the restriction to unit parts (that is, fractions
  that in modern notation are written with 1 as the numerator). To express the result
  of dividing 4 by 7, for instance, which in modern notation is simply 4/7, the scribe
  wrote 1/2 + 1/14. The procedure for finding quotients in this form merely extends
  the usual method for the division of integers, where one now inspects the entries
  for 2/3, 1/3, 1/6, etc., and 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, etc., until the corresponding multiples
  of the divisor sum to the dividend. (The scribes included 2/3, one may observe,
  even though it is not a unit fraction.) In practice the procedure can sometimes
  become quite complicated (for example, the value for 2/29 is given in the Rhind
  papyrus as 1/24 + 1/58 + 1/174 + 1/232) and can be worked out in different ways
  (for example, the same 2/29 might be found as 1/15 + 1/435 or as 1/16 + 1/232 +
  1/464, etc.). A considerable portion of the papyrus texts is devoted to tables to
  facilitate the finding of such unit-fraction values.These elementary operations
  are all that one needs for solving the arithmetic problems in the papyri. For example,
  “to divide 6 loaves among 10 men” (Rhind papyrus, problem 3), one merely divides
  to get the answer 1/2 + 1/10. In one group of problems an interesting trick is used:
  “A quantity (aha) and its 7th together make 19—what is it?” (Rhind papyrus, problem
  24). Here one first supposes the quantity to be 7: since 11/7 of it becomes 8, not
  19, one takes 19/8 (that is, 2 + 1/4 + 1/8), and its multiple by 7 (16 + 1/2 + 1/8)
  becomes the required answer. This type of procedure (sometimes called the method
  of “false position” or “false assumption”) is familiar in many other arithmetic
  traditions (e.g., the Chinese, Hindu, Muslim, and Renaissance European), although
  they appear to have no direct link to the Egyptian.The geometric problems in the
  papyri seek measurements of figures, like rectangles and triangles of given base
  and height, by means of suitable arithmetic operations. In a more complicated problem,
  a rectangle is sought whose area is 12 and whose height is 1/2 + 1/4 times its base
  (Golenishchev papyrus, problem 6). To solve the problem, the ratio is inverted and
  multiplied by the area, yielding 16; the square root of the result (4) is the base
  of the rectangle, and 1/2 + 1/4 times 4, or 3, is the height. The entire process
  is analogous to the process of solving the algebraic equation for the problem (x × 3/4x = 12),
  though without the use of a letter for the unknown. An interesting procedure is
  used to find the area of the circle (Rhind papyrus, problem 50): 1/9 of the diameter
  is discarded, and the result is squared. For example, if the diameter is 9, the
  area is set equal to 64. The scribe recognized that the area of a circle is proportional
  to the square of the diameter and assumed for the constant of proportionality (that
  is, π/4) the value 64/81. This is a rather good estimate, being about 0.6 percent
  too large. (It is not as close, however, as the now common estimate of 31/7, first
  proposed by Archimedes, which is only about 0.04 percent too large.) But there is
  nothing in the papyri indicating that the scribes were aware that this rule was
  only approximate rather than exact.A remarkable result is the rule for the volume
  of the truncated pyramid (Golenishchev papyrus, problem 14). The scribe assumes
  the height to be 6, the base to be a square of side 4, and the top a square of side
  2. He multiplies one-third the height times 28, finding the volume to be 56; here
  28 is computed from 2 × 2 + 2 × 4 + 4 × 4. Since this is correct, it can be assumed
  that the scribe also knew the general rule: A = (h/3)(a2 + ab + b2). How the scribes
  actually derived the rule is a matter for debate, but it is reasonable to suppose
  that they were aware of related rules, such as that for the volume of a pyramid:
  one-third the height times the area of the base.The Egyptians employed the equivalent
  of similar triangles to measure distances. For instance, the seked of a pyramid
  is stated as the number of palms in the horizontal corresponding to a rise of one
  cubit (seven palms). (See the figure.) Thus, if the seked is 51/4 and the base is
  140 cubits, the height becomes 931/3 cubits (Rhind papyrus, problem 57). The Greek
  sage Thales of Miletus (6th century bc) is said to have measured the height of pyramids
  by means of their shadows (the report derives from Hieronymus, a disciple of Aristotle
  in the 4th century bc). In light of the seked computations, however, this report
  must indicate an aspect of Egyptian surveying that extended back at least 1,000
  years before the time of Thales.The papyri thus bear witness to a mathematical tradition
  closely tied to the practical accounting and surveying activities of the scribes.
  Occasionally, the scribes loosened up a bit: one problem (Rhind papyrus, problem
  79), for example, seeks the total from seven houses, seven cats per house, seven
  mice per cat, seven ears of wheat per mouse, and seven hekat of grain per ear (result:
  19,607). Certainly the scribe’s interest in progressions (for which he appears to
  have a rule) goes beyond practical considerations. Other than this, however, Egyptian
  mathematics falls firmly within the range of practice.Even allowing for the scantiness
  of the documentation that survives, the Egyptian achievement in mathematics must
  be viewed as modest. Its most striking features are competence and continuity. The
  scribes managed to work out the basic arithmetic and geometry necessary for their
  official duties as civil managers, and their methods persisted with little evident
  change for at least a millennium, perhaps two. Indeed, when Egypt came under Greek
  domination in the Hellenistic period (from the 3rd century bc onward), the older
  school methods continued. Quite remarkably, the older unit-fraction methods are
  still prominent in Egyptian school papyri written in the demotic (Egyptian) and
  Greek languages as late as the 7th century ad, for example.To the extent that Egyptian
  mathematics left a legacy at all, it was through its impact on the emerging Greek
  mathematical tradition between the 6th and 4th centuries bc. Because the documentation
  from this period is limited, the manner and significance of the influence can only
  be conjectured. But the report about Thales measuring the height of pyramids is
  only one of several such accounts of Greek intellectuals learning from Egyptians;
  Herodotus and Plato describe with approval Egyptian practices in the teaching and
  application of mathematics. This literary evidence has historical support, since
  the Greeks maintained continuous trade and military operations in Egypt from the
  7th century bc onward. It is thus plausible that basic precedents for the Greeks’
  earliest mathematical efforts—how they dealt with fractional parts or measured areas
  and volumes, or their use of ratios in connection with similar figures—came from
  the learning of the ancient Egyptian scribes.\r\n"

  and relation that has evolved from elemental practices of counting, measuring, and
  describing the shapes of objects. It deals with logical reasoning and quantitative
  calculation, and its development has involved an increasing degree of idealization
  and abstraction of its subject matter. Since the 17th century, mathematics has been
  an indispensable adjunct to the physical sciences and technology, and in more recent
  times it has assumed a similar role in the quantitative aspects of the life sciences.In
  many cultures—under the stimulus of the needs of practical pursuits, such as commerce
  and agriculture—mathematics has developed far beyond basic counting. This growth
  has been greatest in societies complex enough to sustain these activities and to
  provide leisure for contemplation and the opportunity to build on the achievements
  of earlier mathematicians.All mathematical systems (for example, Euclidean geometry)
  are combinations of sets of axioms and of theorems that can be logically deduced
  from the axioms. Inquiries into the logical and philosophical basis of mathematics
  reduce to questions of whether the axioms of a given system ensure its completeness
  and its consistency. For full treatment of this aspect, see mathematics, foundations
  of.This article offers a history of mathematics from ancient times to the present.
  As a consequence of the exponential growth of science, most mathematics has developed
  since the 15th century ad, and it is a historical fact that from the 15th century
  to the late 20th century new developments in mathematics have been largely concentrated
  in Europe and North America. For these reasons the bulk of this article is devoted
  to European developments since 1500.This does not mean, however, that developments
  elsewhere have been unimportant. Indeed, to understand the history of mathematics
  in Europe, it is necessary to know its history at least in Mesopotamia and Egypt,
  in ancient Greece, and in Islamic civilization from the 9th to the 15th century.
  The way in which these civilizations influenced one another and the important direct
  contributions Greece and Islam made to later developments are discussed in the first
  parts of this article.India’s contributions to the development of contemporary mathematics
  were made through the considerable influence of Indian achievements on Islamic mathematics
  during its formative years. A separate article, South Asian mathematics, focuses
  on the early history of mathematics in the Indian subcontinent and the development
  there of the modern decimal place-value numeral system. The article East Asian mathematics
  covers the mostly independent development of mathematics in China, Japan, Korea,
  and Vietnam.The substantive branches of mathematics are treated in several articles.

  theory; numerical analysis; optimization; probability theory; set theory; statistics;
  trigonometry.Ancient mathematical sourcesIt is important to be aware of the character
  of the sources for the study of the history of mathematics. The history of Mesopotamian
  and Egyptian mathematics is based on the extant original documents written by scribes.
  Although in the case of Egypt these documents are few, they are all of a type and
  leave little doubt that Egyptian mathematics was, on the whole, elementary and profoundly
  practical in its orientation. For Mesopotamian mathematics, on the other hand, there
  are a large number of clay tablets, which reveal mathematical achievements of a
  much higher order than those of the Egyptians. The tablets indicate that the Mesopotamians
  had a great deal of remarkable mathematical knowledge, although they offer no evidence
  that this knowledge was organized into a deductive system. Future research may reveal
  more about the early development of mathematics in Mesopotamia or about its influence
  on Greek mathematics, but it seems likely that this picture of Mesopotamian mathematics
  will stand.From the period before Alexander the Great, no Greek mathematical documents
  have been preserved except for fragmentary paraphrases, and, even for the subsequent
  period, it is well to remember that the oldest copies of Euclid’s Elements are in
  Byzantine manuscripts dating from the 10th century ad. This stands in complete contrast
  to the situation described above for Egyptian and Babylonian documents. Although
  in general outline the present account of Greek mathematics is secure, in such important
  matters as the origin of the axiomatic method, the pre-Euclidean theory of ratios,
  and the discovery of the conic sections, historians have given competing accounts
  based on fragmentary texts, quotations of early writings culled from nonmathematical
  sources, and a considerable amount of conjecture.Many important treatises from the
  early period of Islamic mathematics have not survived or have survived only in Latin
  translations, so that there are still many unanswered questions about the relationship
  between early Islamic mathematics and the mathematics of Greece and India. In addition,
  the amount of surviving material from later centuries is so large in comparison
  with that which has been studied that it is not yet possible to offer any sure judgment
  of what later Islamic mathematics did not contain, and therefore it is not yet possible
  to evaluate with any assurance what was original in European mathematics from the
  11th to the 15th century.In modern times the invention of printing has largely solved
  the problem of obtaining secure texts and has allowed historians of mathematics
  to concentrate their editorial efforts on the correspondence or the unpublished
  works of mathematicians. However, the exponential growth of mathematics means that,
  for the period from the 19th century on, historians are able to treat only the major
  figures in any detail. In addition, there is, as the period gets nearer the present,
  the problem of perspective. Mathematics, like any other human activity, has its
  fashions, and the nearer one is to a given period, the more likely these fashions
  will look like the wave of the future. For this reason, the present article makes
  no attempt to assess the most recent developments in the subject.John L. BerggrenMathematics
  in ancient MesopotamiaUntil the 1920s it was commonly supposed that mathematics
  had its birth among the ancient Greeks. What was known of earlier traditions, such
  as the Egyptian as represented by the Rhind papyrus (edited for the first time only
  in 1877), offered at best a meagre precedent. This impression gave way to a very
  different view as Orientalists succeeded in deciphering and interpreting the technical
  materials from ancient Mesopotamia.Owing to the durability of the Mesopotamian scribes’
  clay tablets, the surviving evidence of this culture is substantial. Existing specimens
  of mathematics represent all the major eras—the Sumerian kingdoms of the 3rd millennium
  bc, the Akkadian and Babylonian regimes (2nd millennium), and the empires of the
  Assyrians (early 1st millennium), Persians (6th through 4th centuries bc), and Greeks
  (3rd century bc to 1st century ad). The level of competence was already high as
  early as the Old Babylonian dynasty, the time of the lawgiver-king Hammurabi (c.
  18th century bc), but after that there were few notable advances. The application
  of mathematics to astronomy, however, flourished during the Persian and Seleucid
  (Greek) periods.The numeral system and arithmetic operationsUnlike the Egyptians,
  the mathematicians of the Old Babylonian period went far beyond the immediate challenges
  of their official accounting duties. For example, they introduced a versatile numeral
  system, which, like the modern system, exploited the notion of place value, and
  they developed computational methods that took advantage of this means of expressing
  numbers; they solved linear and quadratic problems by methods much like those now
  used in algebra; their success with the study of what are now called Pythagorean
  number triples was a remarkable feat in number theory. The scribes who made such
  discoveries must have believed mathematics to be worthy of study in its own right,
  not just as a practical tool.The older Sumerian system of numerals followed an additive
  decimal (base-10) principle similar to that of the Egyptians. But the Old Babylonian
  system converted this into a place-value system with the base of 60 (sexagesimal).
  The reasons for the choice of 60 are obscure, but one good mathematical reason might
  have been the existence of so many divisors (2, 3, 4, and 5, and some multiples)
  of the base, which would have greatly facilitated the operation of division. For
  numbers from 1 to 59, the symbols  for 1 and  for 10 were combined in the simple
  additive manner (e.g.,  represented 32). But, to express larger values, the Babylonians
  applied the concept of place value: for example, 60 was written as , 70 as , 80
  as , and so on. In fact,  could represent any power of 60. The context determined
  which power was intended. The Babylonians appear to have developed a placeholder
  symbol that functioned as a zero by the 3rd century bc, but its precise meaning
  and use is still uncertain. Furthermore, they had no mark to separate numbers into
  integral and fractional parts (as with the modern decimal point). Thus, the three-place
  numeral 3 7 30 could represent 31/8 (i.e., 3 + 7/60 + 30/602), 1871/2 (i.e., 3 × 60 + 7 + 30/60),
  11,250 (i.e., 3 × 602 + 7 × 60 + 30), or a multiple of these numbers by any power
  of 60.The four arithmetic operations were performed in the same way as in the modern
  decimal system, except that carrying occurred whenever a sum reached 60 rather than
  10. Multiplication was facilitated by means of tables; one typical tablet lists
  the multiples of a number by 1, 2, 3,…, 19, 20, 30, 40, and 50. To multiply two
  numbers several places long, the scribe first broke the problem down into several
  multiplications, each by a one-place number, and then looked up the value of each
  product in the appropriate tables. He found the answer to the problem by adding
  up these intermediate results. These tables also assisted in division, for the values
  that head them were all reciprocals of regular numbers.Regular numbers are those
  whose prime factors divide the base; the reciprocals of such numbers thus have only
  a finite number of places (by contrast, the reciprocals of nonregular numbers produce
  an infinitely repeating numeral). In base 10, for example, only numbers with factors
  of 2 and 5 (e.g., 8 or 50) are regular, and the reciprocals (1/8 = 0.125, 1/50 = 0.02)
  have finite expressions; but the reciprocals of other numbers (such as 3 and 7)
  repeat infinitely  and , respectively, where the bar indicates the digits that continually
  repeat). In base 60, only numbers with factors of 2, 3, and 5 are regular; for example,
  6 and 54 are regular, so that their reciprocals (10 and 1 6 40) are finite. The
  entries in the multiplication table for 1 6 40 are thus simultaneously multiples
  of its reciprocal 1/54. To divide a number by any regular number, then, one can
  consult the table of multiples for its reciprocal.An interesting tablet in the collection
  of Yale University (see photograph) shows a square with its diagonals; on one side
  is written “30,” under one diagonal “42 25 35,” and right along the same diagonal
  “1 24 51 10” (i.e., 1 + 24/60 + 51/602 + 10/603). This third number is the correct
  value of √2 to four sexagesimal places (equivalent in the decimal system to 1.414213…,
  which is too low by only 1 in the seventh place), while the second number is the
  product of the third number and the first and so gives the length of the diagonal
  when the side is 30. The scribe thus appears to have known an equivalent of the
  familiar long method of finding square roots. An additional element of sophistication
  is that, by choosing 30 (that is, 1/2) for the side, the scribe obtained as the
  diagonal the reciprocal of the value of √2 (since √2/2 = 1/√2), a result useful
  for purposes of division.Geometric and algebraic problemsIn a Babylonian tablet
  now in Berlin, the diagonal of a rectangle of sides 40 and 10 is solved as 40 + 102/(2 × 40).
  Here a very effective approximating rule is being used (that the square root of
  the sum of a2 + b2 can be estimated as a + b2/2a), the same rule found frequently
  in later Greek geometric writings. Both these examples for roots illustrate the
  Babylonians’ arithmetic approach in geometry. They also show that the Babylonians
  were aware of the relation between the hypotenuse and the two legs of a right triangle
  (now commonly known as the Pythagorean theorem) more than a thousand years before
  the Greeks used it.A type of problem that occurs frequently in the Babylonian tablets
  seeks the base and height of a rectangle, where their product and sum have specified
  values. From the given information the scribe worked out the difference, since (b − h)2 = (b + h)2 − 4bh.
  In the same way, if the product and difference were given, the sum could be found.
  And, once both the sum and difference were known, each side could be determined,
  for 2b = (b + h) + (b − h) and 2h = (b + h) − (b − h). This procedure is equivalent
  to a solution of the general quadratic in one unknown. In some places, however,
  the Babylonian scribes solved quadratic problems in terms of a single unknown, just
  as would now be done by means of the quadratic formula.Although these Babylonian
  quadratic procedures have often been described as the earliest appearance of algebra,
  there are important distinctions. The scribes lacked an algebraic symbolism; although
  they must certainly have understood that their solution procedures were general,
  they always presented them in terms of particular cases, rather than as the working
  through of general formulas and identities. They thus lacked the means for presenting
  general derivations and proofs of their solution procedures. Their use of sequential
  procedures rather than formulas, however, is less likely to detract from an evaluation
  of their effort now that algorithmic methods much like theirs have become commonplace
  through the development of computers.As mentioned above, the Babylonian scribes
  knew that the base (b), height (h), and diagonal (d) of a rectangle satisfy the
  relation b2 + h2 = d2. If one selects values at random for two of the terms, the
  third will usually be irrational, but it is possible to find cases in which all
  three terms are integers: for example, 3, 4, 5 and 5, 12, 13. (Such solutions are
  sometimes called Pythagorean triples.) A tablet in the Columbia University Collection
  presents a list of 15 such triples (decimal equivalents are shown in parentheses
  at the right; the gaps in the expressions for h, b, and d separate the place values
  in the sexagesimal numerals):(The entries in the column for h have to be computed
  from the values for b and d, for they do not appear on the tablet; but they must
  once have existed on a portion now missing.) The ordering of the lines becomes clear
  from another column, listing the values of d2/h2 (brackets indicate figures that
  are lost or illegible), which form a continually decreasing sequence: [1 59 0] 15,
  [1 56 56] 58 14 50 6 15,…, [1] 23 13 46 40. Accordingly, the angle formed between
  the diagonal and the base in this sequence increases continually from just over
  45° to just under 60°. Other properties of the sequence suggest that the scribe
  knew the general procedure for finding all such number triples—that for any integers
  p and q, 2d/h = p/q + q/p and 2b/h = p/q − q/p. (In the table the implied values
  p and q turn out to be regular numbers falling in the standard set of reciprocals,
  as mentioned earlier in connection with the multiplication tables.) Scholars are
  still debating nuances of the construction and the intended use of this table, but
  no one questions the high level of expertise implied by it.Mathematical astronomyThe
  sexagesimal method developed by the Babylonians has a far greater computational
  potential than what was actually needed for the older problem texts. With the development
  of mathematical astronomy in the Seleucid period, however, it became indispensable.
  Astronomers sought to predict future occurrences of important phenomena, such as
  lunar eclipses and critical points in planetary cycles (conjunctions, oppositions,
  stationary points, and first and last visibility). They devised a technique for
  computing these positions (expressed in terms of degrees of latitude and longitude,
  measured relative to the path of the Sun’s apparent annual motion) by successively
  adding appropriate terms in arithmetic progression. The results were then organized
  into a table listing positions as far ahead as the scribe chose. (Although the method
  is purely arithmetic, one can interpret it graphically: the tabulated values form
  a linear “zigzag” approximation to what is actually a sinusoidal variation.) While
  observations extending over centuries are required for finding the necessary parameters
  (e.g., periods, angular range between maximum and minimum values, and the like),
  only the computational apparatus at their disposal made the astronomers’ forecasting
  effort possible.Within a relatively short time (perhaps a century or less), the
  elements of this system came into the hands of the Greeks. Although Hipparchus (2nd
  century bc) favoured the geometric approach of his Greek predecessors, he took over
  parameters from the Mesopotamians and adopted their sexagesimal style of computation.
  Through the Greeks it passed to Arab scientists during the Middle Ages and thence
  to Europe, where it remained prominent in mathematical astronomy during the Renaissance
  and the early modern period. To this day it persists in the use of minutes and seconds
  to measure time and angles.Aspects of the Old Babylonian mathematics may have come
  to the Greeks even earlier, perhaps in the 5th century bc, the formative period
  of Greek geometry. There are a number of parallels that scholars have noted: for
  example, the Greek technique of “application of area” (see below Greek mathematics)
  corresponded to the Babylonian quadratic methods (although in a geometric, not arithmetic,
  form). Further, the Babylonian rule for estimating square roots was widely used
  in Greek geometric computations, and there may also have been some shared nuances
  of technical terminology. Although details of the timing and manner of such a transmission
  are obscure because of the absence of explicit documentation, it seems that Western
  mathematics, while stemming largely from the Greeks, is considerably indebted to
  the older Mesopotamians.Mathematics in ancient EgyptThe introduction of writing
  in Egypt in the predynastic period (c. 3000 bc) brought with it the formation of
  a special class of literate professionals, the scribes. By virtue of their writing
  skills, the scribes took on all the duties of a civil service: record keeping, tax
  accounting, the management of public works (building projects and the like), even
  the prosecution of war through overseeing military supplies and payrolls. Young
  men enrolled in scribal schools to learn the essentials of the trade, which included
  not only reading and writing but also the basics of mathematics.One of the texts
  popular as a copy exercise in the schools of the New Kingdom (13th century bc) was
  a satiric letter in which one scribe, Hori, taunts his rival, Amen-em-opet, for
  his incompetence as an adviser and manager. “You are the clever scribe at the head
  of the troops,” Hori chides at one point;a ramp is to be built, 730 cubits long,
  55 cubits wide, with 120 compartments—it is 60 cubits high, 30 cubits in the middle…and
  the generals and the scribes turn to you and say, “You are a clever scribe, your
  name is famous. Is there anything you don’t know? Answer us, how many bricks are
  needed?” Let each compartment be 30 cubits by 7 cubits.This problem, and three others
  like it in the same letter, cannot be solved without further data. But the point
  of the humour is clear, as Hori challenges his rival with these hard, but typical,
  tasks.What is known of Egyptian mathematics tallies well with the tests posed by
  the scribe Hori. The information comes primarily from two long papyrus documents
  that once served as textbooks within scribal schools. The Rhind papyrus (in the
  British Museum) is a copy made in the 17th century bc of a text two centuries older
  still. In it is found a long table of fractional parts to help with division, followed
  by the solutions of 84 specific problems in arithmetic and geometry. The Golenishchev
  papyrus (in the Moscow Museum of Fine Arts), dating from the 19th century bc, presents
  25 problems of a similar type. These problems reflect well the functions the scribes
  would perform, for they deal with how to distribute beer and bread as wages, for
  example, and how to measure the areas of fields as well as the volumes of pyramids
  and other solids.The numeral system and arithmetic operationsThe Egyptians, like
  the Romans after them, expressed numbers according to a decimal scheme, using separate
  symbols for 1, 10, 100, 1,000, and so on; each symbol appeared in the expression
  for a number as many times as the value it represented occurred in the number itself.
  For example,  stood for 24. This rather cumbersome notation was used within the
  hieroglyphic writing (see the figure) found in stone inscriptions and other formal
  texts, but in the papyrus documents the scribes employed a more convenient abbreviated
  script, called hieratic writing (see the figure), where, for example, 24 was written
  .In such a system, addition and subtraction amount to counting how many symbols
  of each kind there are in the numerical expressions and then rewriting with the
  resulting number of symbols. The texts that survive do not reveal what, if any,
  special procedures the scribes used to assist in this. But for multiplication they
  introduced a method of successive doubling. For example, to multiply 28 by 11, one
  constructs a table of multiples of 28 like the following:The several entries in
  the first column that together sum to 11 (i.e., 8, 2, and 1) are checked off. The
  product is then found by adding up the multiples corresponding to these entries;
  thus, 224 + 56 + 28 = 308, the desired product.To divide 308 by 28, the Egyptians
  applied the same procedure in reverse. Using the same table as in the multiplication
  problem, one can see that 8 produces the largest multiple of 28 that is less then
  308 (for the entry at 16 is already 448), and 8 is checked off. The process is then
  repeated, this time for the remainder (84) obtained by subtracting the entry at
  8 (224) from the original number (308). This, however, is already smaller than the
  entry at 4, which consequently is ignored, but it is greater than the entry at 2
  (56), which is then checked off. The process is repeated again for the remainder
  obtained by subtracting 56 from the previous remainder of 84, or 28, which also
  happens to exactly equal the entry at 1 and which is then checked off. The entries
  that have been checked off are added up, yielding the quotient: 8 + 2 + 1 = 11.
  (In most cases, of course, there is a remainder that is less than the divisor.)For
  larger numbers this procedure can be improved by considering multiples of one of
  the factors by 10, 20,…or even by higher orders of magnitude (100, 1,000,…), as
  necessary (in the Egyptian decimal notation, these multiples are easy to work out).
  Thus, one can find the product of 28 by 27 by setting out the multiples of 28 by
  1, 2, 4, 8, 10, and 20. Since the entries 1, 2, 4, and 20 add up to 27, one has
  only to add up the corresponding multiples to find the answer.Computations involving
  fractions are carried out under the restriction to unit parts (that is, fractions
  that in modern notation are written with 1 as the numerator). To express the result
  of dividing 4 by 7, for instance, which in modern notation is simply 4/7, the scribe
  wrote 1/2 + 1/14. The procedure for finding quotients in this form merely extends
  the usual method for the division of integers, where one now inspects the entries
  for 2/3, 1/3, 1/6, etc., and 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, etc., until the corresponding multiples
  of the divisor sum to the dividend. (The scribes included 2/3, one may observe,
  even though it is not a unit fraction.) In practice the procedure can sometimes
  become quite complicated (for example, the value for 2/29 is given in the Rhind
  papyrus as 1/24 + 1/58 + 1/174 + 1/232) and can be worked out in different ways
  (for example, the same 2/29 might be found as 1/15 + 1/435 or as 1/16 + 1/232 +
  1/464, etc.). A considerable portion of the papyrus texts is devoted to tables to
  facilitate the finding of such unit-fraction values.These elementary operations
  are all that one needs for solving the arithmetic problems in the papyri. For example,
  “to divide 6 loaves among 10 men” (Rhind papyrus, problem 3), one merely divides
  to get the answer 1/2 + 1/10. In one group of problems an interesting trick is used:
  “A quantity (aha) and its 7th together make 19—what is it?” (Rhind papyrus, problem
  24). Here one first supposes the quantity to be 7: since 11/7 of it becomes 8, not
  19, one takes 19/8 (that is, 2 + 1/4 + 1/8), and its multiple by 7 (16 + 1/2 + 1/8)
  becomes the required answer. This type of procedure (sometimes called the method
  of “false position” or “false assumption”) is familiar in many other arithmetic
  traditions (e.g., the Chinese, Hindu, Muslim, and Renaissance European), although
  they appear to have no direct link to the Egyptian.GeometryThe geometric problems
  in the papyri seek measurements of figures, like rectangles and triangles of given
  base and height, by means of suitable arithmetic operations. In a more complicated
  problem, a rectangle is sought whose area is 12 and whose height is 1/2 + 1/4 times
  its base (Golenishchev papyrus, problem 6). To solve the problem, the ratio is inverted
  and multiplied by the area, yielding 16; the square root of the result (4) is the
  base of the rectangle, and 1/2 + 1/4 times 4, or 3, is the height. The entire process
  is analogous to the process of solving the algebraic equation for the problem (x × 3/4x = 12),
  though without the use of a letter for the unknown. An interesting procedure is
  used to find the area of the circle (Rhind papyrus, problem 50): 1/9 of the diameter
  is discarded, and the result is squared. For example, if the diameter is 9, the
  area is set equal to 64. The scribe recognized that the area of a circle is proportional
  to the square of the diameter and assumed for the constant of proportionality (that
  is, π/4) the value 64/81. This is a rather good estimate, being about 0.6 percent
  too large. (It is not as close, however, as the now common estimate of 31/7, first
  proposed by Archimedes, which is only about 0.04 percent too large.) But there is
  nothing in the papyri indicating that the scribes were aware that this rule was
  only approximate rather than exact.A remarkable result is the rule for the volume
  of the truncated pyramid (Golenishchev papyrus, problem 14). The scribe assumes
  the height to be 6, the base to be a square of side 4, and the top a square of side
  2. He multiplies one-third the height times 28, finding the volume to be 56; here
  28 is computed from 2 × 2 + 2 × 4 + 4 × 4. Since this is correct, it can be assumed
  that the scribe also knew the general rule: A = (h/3)(a2 + ab + b2). How the scribes
  actually derived the rule is a matter for debate, but it is reasonable to suppose
  that they were aware of related rules, such as that for the volume of a pyramid:
  one-third the height times the area of the base.The Egyptians employed the equivalent
  of similar triangles to measure distances. For instance, the seked of a pyramid
  is stated as the number of palms in the horizontal corresponding to a rise of one
  cubit (seven palms). (See the figure.) Thus, if the seked is 51/4 and the base is
  140 cubits, the height becomes 931/3 cubits (Rhind papyrus, problem 57). The Greek
  sage Thales of Miletus (6th century bc) is said to have measured the height of pyramids
  by means of their shadows (the report derives from Hieronymus, a disciple of Aristotle
  in the 4th century bc). In light of the seked computations, however, this report
  must indicate an aspect of Egyptian surveying that extended back at least 1,000
  years before the time of Thales.Assessment of Egyptian mathematicsThe papyri thus
  bear witness to a mathematical tradition closely tied to the practical accounting
  and surveying activities of the scribes. Occasionally, the scribes loosened up a
  bit: one problem (Rhind papyrus, problem 79), for example, seeks the total from
  seven houses, seven cats per house, seven mice per cat, seven ears of wheat per
  mouse, and seven hekat of grain per ear (result: 19,607). Certainly the scribe’s
  interest in progressions (for which he appears to have a rule) goes beyond practical
  considerations. Other than this, however, Egyptian mathematics falls firmly within
  the range of practice.Even allowing for the scantiness of the documentation that
  survives, the Egyptian achievement in mathematics must be viewed as modest. Its
  most striking features are competence and continuity. The scribes managed to work
  out the basic arithmetic and geometry necessary for their official duties as civil
  managers, and their methods persisted with little evident change for at least a
  millennium, perhaps two. Indeed, when Egypt came under Greek domination in the Hellenistic
  period (from the 3rd century bc onward), the older school methods continued. Quite
  remarkably, the older unit-fraction methods are still prominent in Egyptian school
  papyri written in the demotic (Egyptian) and Greek languages as late as the 7th
  century ad, for example.To the extent that Egyptian mathematics left a legacy at
  all, it was through its impact on the emerging Greek mathematical tradition between
  the 6th and 4th centuries bc. Because the documentation from this period is limited,
  the manner and significance of the influence can only be conjectured. But the report
  about Thales measuring the height of pyramids is only one of several such accounts
  of Greek intellectuals learning from Egyptians; Herodotus and Plato describe with
  approval Egyptian practices in the teaching and application of mathematics. This
  literary evidence has historical support, since the Greeks maintained continuous
  trade and military operations in Egypt from the 7th century bc onward. It is thus
  plausible that basic precedents for the Greeks’ earliest mathematical efforts—how
  they dealt with fractional parts or measured areas and volumes, or their use of
  ratios in connection with similar figures—came from the learning of the ancient
  Egyptian scribes.\n                \n\n        Images\n                    \n                    quizzes\n

  order, and relation that has evolved from elemental practices of counting, measuring,
  and describing the shapes of objects. It deals with logical reasoning and quantitative
  calculation, and its development has involved an increasing degree of idealization
  and abstraction of its subject matter. Since the 17th century, mathematics has been
  an indispensable adjunct to the physical sciences and technology, and in more recent
  times it has assumed a similar role in the quantitative aspects of the life sciences.In
  many cultures—under the stimulus of the needs of practical pursuits, such as commerce
  and agriculture—mathematics has developed far beyond basic counting. This growth
  has been greatest in societies complex enough to sustain these activities and to
  provide leisure for contemplation and the opportunity to build on the achievements
  of earlier mathematicians.All mathematical systems (for example, Euclidean geometry)
  are combinations of sets of axioms and of theorems that can be logically deduced
  from the axioms. Inquiries into the logical and philosophical basis of mathematics
  reduce to questions of whether the axioms of a given system ensure its completeness
  and its consistency. For full treatment of this aspect, see mathematics, foundations
  of.This article offers a history of mathematics from ancient times to the present.
  As a consequence of the exponential growth of science, most mathematics has developed
  since the 15th century ad, and it is a historical fact that from the 15th century
  to the late 20th century new developments in mathematics have been largely concentrated
  in Europe and North America. For these reasons the bulk of this article is devoted
  to European developments since 1500.This does not mean, however, that developments
  elsewhere have been unimportant. Indeed, to understand the history of mathematics
  in Europe, it is necessary to know its history at least in Mesopotamia and Egypt,
  in ancient Greece, and in Islamic civilization from the 9th to the 15th century.
  The way in which these civilizations influenced one another and the important direct
  contributions Greece and Islam made to later developments are discussed in the first
  parts of this article.India’s contributions to the development of contemporary mathematics
  were made through the considerable influence of Indian achievements on Islamic mathematics
  during its formative years. A separate article, South Asian mathematics, focuses
  on the early history of mathematics in the Indian subcontinent and the development
  there of the modern decimal place-value numeral system. The article East Asian mathematics
  covers the mostly independent development of mathematics in China, Japan, Korea,
  and Vietnam.The substantive branches of mathematics are treated in several articles.
  See algebra; analysis; arithmetic; combinatorics; game theory; geometry; number
  theory; numerical analysis; optimization; probability theory; set theory; statistics;
  trigonometry.It is important to be aware of the character of the sources for the
  study of the history of mathematics. The history of Mesopotamian and Egyptian mathematics
  is based on the extant original documents written by scribes. Although in the case
  of Egypt these documents are few, they are all of a type and leave little doubt
  that Egyptian mathematics was, on the whole, elementary and profoundly practical
  in its orientation. For Mesopotamian mathematics, on the other hand, there are a
  large number of clay tablets, which reveal mathematical achievements of a much higher
  order than those of the Egyptians. The tablets indicate that the Mesopotamians had
  a great deal of remarkable mathematical knowledge, although they offer no evidence
  that this knowledge was organized into a deductive system. Future research may reveal
  more about the early development of mathematics in Mesopotamia or about its influence
  on Greek mathematics, but it seems likely that this picture of Mesopotamian mathematics
  will stand.From the period before Alexander the Great, no Greek mathematical documents
  have been preserved except for fragmentary paraphrases, and, even for the subsequent
  period, it is well to remember that the oldest copies of Euclid’s Elements are in
  Byzantine manuscripts dating from the 10th century ad. This stands in complete contrast
  to the situation described above for Egyptian and Babylonian documents. Although
  in general outline the present account of Greek mathematics is secure, in such important
  matters as the origin of the axiomatic method, the pre-Euclidean theory of ratios,
  and the discovery of the conic sections, historians have given competing accounts
  based on fragmentary texts, quotations of early writings culled from nonmathematical
  sources, and a considerable amount of conjecture.Many important treatises from the
  early period of Islamic mathematics have not survived or have survived only in Latin
  translations, so that there are still many unanswered questions about the relationship
  between early Islamic mathematics and the mathematics of Greece and India. In addition,
  the amount of surviving material from later centuries is so large in comparison
  with that which has been studied that it is not yet possible to offer any sure judgment
  of what later Islamic mathematics did not contain, and therefore it is not yet possible
  to evaluate with any assurance what was original in European mathematics from the
  11th to the 15th century.In modern times the invention of printing has largely solved
  the problem of obtaining secure texts and has allowed historians of mathematics
  to concentrate their editorial efforts on the correspondence or the unpublished
  works of mathematicians. However, the exponential growth of mathematics means that,
  for the period from the 19th century on, historians are able to treat only the major
  figures in any detail. In addition, there is, as the period gets nearer the present,
  the problem of perspective. Mathematics, like any other human activity, has its
  fashions, and the nearer one is to a given period, the more likely these fashions
  will look like the wave of the future. For this reason, the present article makes
  no attempt to assess the most recent developments in the subject.Until the 1920s
  it was commonly supposed that mathematics had its birth among the ancient Greeks.
  What was known of earlier traditions, such as the Egyptian as represented by the
  Rhind papyrus (edited for the first time only in 1877), offered at best a meagre
  precedent. This impression gave way to a very different view as Orientalists succeeded
  in deciphering and interpreting the technical materials from ancient Mesopotamia.Owing
  to the durability of the Mesopotamian scribes’ clay tablets, the surviving evidence
  of this culture is substantial. Existing specimens of mathematics represent all
  the major eras—the Sumerian kingdoms of the 3rd millennium bc, the Akkadian and
  Babylonian regimes (2nd millennium), and the empires of the Assyrians (early 1st
  millennium), Persians (6th through 4th centuries bc), and Greeks (3rd century bc
  to 1st century ad). The level of competence was already high as early as the Old
  Babylonian dynasty, the time of the lawgiver-king Hammurabi (c. 18th century bc),
  but after that there were few notable advances. The application of mathematics to
  astronomy, however, flourished during the Persian and Seleucid (Greek) periods.Unlike
  the Egyptians, the mathematicians of the Old Babylonian period went far beyond the
  immediate challenges of their official accounting duties. For example, they introduced
  a versatile numeral system, which, like the modern system, exploited the notion
  of place value, and they developed computational methods that took advantage of
  this means of expressing numbers; they solved linear and quadratic problems by methods
  much like those now used in algebra; their success with the study of what are now
  called Pythagorean number triples was a remarkable feat in number theory. The scribes
  who made such discoveries must have believed mathematics to be worthy of study in
  its own right, not just as a practical tool.The older Sumerian system of numerals
  followed an additive decimal (base-10) principle similar to that of the Egyptians.
  But the Old Babylonian system converted this into a place-value system with the
  base of 60 (sexagesimal). The reasons for the choice of 60 are obscure, but one
  good mathematical reason might have been the existence of so many divisors (2, 3,
  4, and 5, and some multiples) of the base, which would have greatly facilitated
  the operation of division. For numbers from 1 to 59, the symbols  for 1 and  for
  10 were combined in the simple additive manner (e.g.,  represented 32). But, to
  express larger values, the Babylonians applied the concept of place value: for example,
  60 was written as , 70 as , 80 as , and so on. In fact,  could represent any power
  of 60. The context determined which power was intended. The Babylonians appear to
  have developed a placeholder symbol that functioned as a zero by the 3rd century
  bc, but its precise meaning and use is still uncertain. Furthermore, they had no
  mark to separate numbers into integral and fractional parts (as with the modern
  decimal point). Thus, the three-place numeral 3 7 30 could represent 31/8 (i.e.,
  3 + 7/60 + 30/602), 1871/2 (i.e., 3 × 60 + 7 + 30/60), 11,250 (i.e., 3 × 602 + 7 × 60 + 30),
  or a multiple of these numbers by any power of 60.The four arithmetic operations
  were performed in the same way as in the modern decimal system, except that carrying
  occurred whenever a sum reached 60 rather than 10. Multiplication was facilitated
  by means of tables; one typical tablet lists the multiples of a number by 1, 2,
  3,…, 19, 20, 30, 40, and 50. To multiply two numbers several places long, the scribe
  first broke the problem down into several multiplications, each by a one-place number,
  and then looked up the value of each product in the appropriate tables. He found
  the answer to the problem by adding up these intermediate results. These tables
  also assisted in division, for the values that head them were all reciprocals of
  regular numbers.Regular numbers are those whose prime factors divide the base; the
  reciprocals of such numbers thus have only a finite number of places (by contrast,
  the reciprocals of nonregular numbers produce an infinitely repeating numeral).
  In base 10, for example, only numbers with factors of 2 and 5 (e.g., 8 or 50) are
  regular, and the reciprocals (1/8 = 0.125, 1/50 = 0.02) have finite expressions;
  but the reciprocals of other numbers (such as 3 and 7) repeat infinitely  and ,
  respectively, where the bar indicates the digits that continually repeat). In base
  60, only numbers with factors of 2, 3, and 5 are regular; for example, 6 and 54
  are regular, so that their reciprocals (10 and 1 6 40) are finite. The entries in
  the multiplication table for 1 6 40 are thus simultaneously multiples of its reciprocal
  1/54. To divide a number by any regular number, then, one can consult the table
  of multiples for its reciprocal.An interesting tablet in the collection of Yale
  University (see photograph) shows a square with its diagonals; on one side is written
  “30,” under one diagonal “42 25 35,” and right along the same diagonal “1 24 51
  10” (i.e., 1 + 24/60 + 51/602 + 10/603). This third number is the correct value
  of √2 to four sexagesimal places (equivalent in the decimal system to 1.414213…,
  which is too low by only 1 in the seventh place), while the second number is the
  product of the third number and the first and so gives the length of the diagonal
  when the side is 30. The scribe thus appears to have known an equivalent of the
  familiar long method of finding square roots. An additional element of sophistication
  is that, by choosing 30 (that is, 1/2) for the side, the scribe obtained as the
  diagonal the reciprocal of the value of √2 (since √2/2 = 1/√2), a result useful
  for purposes of division.In a Babylonian tablet now in Berlin, the diagonal of a
  rectangle of sides 40 and 10 is solved as 40 + 102/(2 × 40). Here a very effective
  approximating rule is being used (that the square root of the sum of a2 + b2 can
  be estimated as a + b2/2a), the same rule found frequently in later Greek geometric
  writings. Both these examples for roots illustrate the Babylonians’ arithmetic approach
  in geometry. They also show that the Babylonians were aware of the relation between
  the hypotenuse and the two legs of a right triangle (now commonly known as the Pythagorean
  theorem) more than a thousand years before the Greeks used it.A type of problem
  that occurs frequently in the Babylonian tablets seeks the base and height of a
  rectangle, where their product and sum have specified values. From the given information
  the scribe worked out the difference, since (b − h)2 = (b + h)2 − 4bh. In the same
  way, if the product and difference were given, the sum could be found. And, once
  both the sum and difference were known, each side could be determined, for 2b = (b + h) + (b − h)
  and 2h = (b + h) − (b − h). This procedure is equivalent to a solution of the general
  quadratic in one unknown. In some places, however, the Babylonian scribes solved
  quadratic problems in terms of a single unknown, just as would now be done by means
  of the quadratic formula.Although these Babylonian quadratic procedures have often
  been described as the earliest appearance of algebra, there are important distinctions.
  The scribes lacked an algebraic symbolism; although they must certainly have understood
  that their solution procedures were general, they always presented them in terms
  of particular cases, rather than as the working through of general formulas and
  identities. They thus lacked the means for presenting general derivations and proofs
  of their solution procedures. Their use of sequential procedures rather than formulas,
  however, is less likely to detract from an evaluation of their effort now that algorithmic
  methods much like theirs have become commonplace through the development of computers.As
  mentioned above, the Babylonian scribes knew that the base (b), height (h), and
  diagonal (d) of a rectangle satisfy the relation b2 + h2 = d2. If one selects values
  at random for two of the terms, the third will usually be irrational, but it is
  possible to find cases in which all three terms are integers: for example, 3, 4,
  5 and 5, 12, 13. (Such solutions are sometimes called Pythagorean triples.) A tablet
  in the Columbia University Collection presents a list of 15 such triples (decimal
  equivalents are shown in parentheses at the right; the gaps in the expressions for
  h, b, and d separate the place values in the sexagesimal numerals):(The entries
  in the column for h have to be computed from the values for b and d, for they do
  not appear on the tablet; but they must once have existed on a portion now missing.)
  The ordering of the lines becomes clear from another column, listing the values
  of d2/h2 (brackets indicate figures that are lost or illegible), which form a continually
  decreasing sequence: [1 59 0] 15, [1 56 56] 58 14 50 6 15,…, [1] 23 13 46 40. Accordingly,
  the angle formed between the diagonal and the base in this sequence increases continually
  from just over 45° to just under 60°. Other properties of the sequence suggest that
  the scribe knew the general procedure for finding all such number triples—that for
  any integers p and q, 2d/h = p/q + q/p and 2b/h = p/q − q/p. (In the table the implied
  values p and q turn out to be regular numbers falling in the standard set of reciprocals,
  as mentioned earlier in connection with the multiplication tables.) Scholars are
  still debating nuances of the construction and the intended use of this table, but
  no one questions the high level of expertise implied by it.The sexagesimal method
  developed by the Babylonians has a far greater computational potential than what
  was actually needed for the older problem texts. With the development of mathematical
  astronomy in the Seleucid period, however, it became indispensable. Astronomers
  sought to predict future occurrences of important phenomena, such as lunar eclipses
  and critical points in planetary cycles (conjunctions, oppositions, stationary points,
  and first and last visibility). They devised a technique for computing these positions
  (expressed in terms of degrees of latitude and longitude, measured relative to the
  path of the Sun’s apparent annual motion) by successively adding appropriate terms
  in arithmetic progression. The results were then organized into a table listing
  positions as far ahead as the scribe chose. (Although the method is purely arithmetic,
  one can interpret it graphically: the tabulated values form a linear “zigzag” approximation
  to what is actually a sinusoidal variation.) While observations extending over centuries
  are required for finding the necessary parameters (e.g., periods, angular range
  between maximum and minimum values, and the like), only the computational apparatus
  at their disposal made the astronomers’ forecasting effort possible.Within a relatively
  short time (perhaps a century or less), the elements of this system came into the
  hands of the Greeks. Although Hipparchus (2nd century bc) favoured the geometric
  approach of his Greek predecessors, he took over parameters from the Mesopotamians
  and adopted their sexagesimal style of computation. Through the Greeks it passed
  to Arab scientists during the Middle Ages and thence to Europe, where it remained
  prominent in mathematical astronomy during the Renaissance and the early modern
  period. To this day it persists in the use of minutes and seconds to measure time
  and angles.Aspects of the Old Babylonian mathematics may have come to the Greeks
  even earlier, perhaps in the 5th century bc, the formative period of Greek geometry.
  There are a number of parallels that scholars have noted: for example, the Greek
  technique of “application of area” (see below Greek mathematics) corresponded to
  the Babylonian quadratic methods (although in a geometric, not arithmetic, form).
  Further, the Babylonian rule for estimating square roots was widely used in Greek
  geometric computations, and there may also have been some shared nuances of technical
  terminology. Although details of the timing and manner of such a transmission are
  obscure because of the absence of explicit documentation, it seems that Western
  mathematics, while stemming largely from the Greeks, is considerably indebted to
  the older Mesopotamians.The introduction of writing in Egypt in the predynastic
  period (c. 3000 bc) brought with it the formation of a special class of literate
  professionals, the scribes. By virtue of their writing skills, the scribes took
  on all the duties of a civil service: record keeping, tax accounting, the management
  of public works (building projects and the like), even the prosecution of war through
  overseeing military supplies and payrolls. Young men enrolled in scribal schools
  to learn the essentials of the trade, which included not only reading and writing
  but also the basics of mathematics.One of the texts popular as a copy exercise in
  the schools of the New Kingdom (13th century bc) was a satiric letter in which one
  scribe, Hori, taunts his rival, Amen-em-opet, for his incompetence as an adviser
  and manager. “You are the clever scribe at the head of the troops,” Hori chides
  at one point;a ramp is to be built, 730 cubits long, 55 cubits wide, with 120 compartments—it
  is 60 cubits high, 30 cubits in the middle…and the generals and the scribes turn
  to you and say, “You are a clever scribe, your name is famous. Is there anything
  you don’t know? Answer us, how many bricks are needed?” Let each compartment be
  30 cubits by 7 cubits.This problem, and three others like it in the same letter,
  cannot be solved without further data. But the point of the humour is clear, as
  Hori challenges his rival with these hard, but typical, tasks.What is known of Egyptian
  mathematics tallies well with the tests posed by the scribe Hori. The information
  comes primarily from two long papyrus documents that once served as textbooks within
  scribal schools. The Rhind papyrus (in the British Museum) is a copy made in the
  17th century bc of a text two centuries older still. In it is found a long table
  of fractional parts to help with division, followed by the solutions of 84 specific
  problems in arithmetic and geometry. The Golenishchev papyrus (in the Moscow Museum
  of Fine Arts), dating from the 19th century bc, presents 25 problems of a similar
  type. These problems reflect well the functions the scribes would perform, for they
  deal with how to distribute beer and bread as wages, for example, and how to measure
  the areas of fields as well as the volumes of pyramids and other solids.The Egyptians,
  like the Romans after them, expressed numbers according to a decimal scheme, using
  separate symbols for 1, 10, 100, 1,000, and so on; each symbol appeared in the expression
  for a number as many times as the value it represented occurred in the number itself.
  For example,  stood for 24. This rather cumbersome notation was used within the
  hieroglyphic writing (see the figure) found in stone inscriptions and other formal
  texts, but in the papyrus documents the scribes employed a more convenient abbreviated
  script, called hieratic writing (see the figure), where, for example, 24 was written
  .In such a system, addition and subtraction amount to counting how many symbols
  of each kind there are in the numerical expressions and then rewriting with the
  resulting number of symbols. The texts that survive do not reveal what, if any,
  special procedures the scribes used to assist in this. But for multiplication they
  introduced a method of successive doubling. For example, to multiply 28 by 11, one
  constructs a table of multiples of 28 like the following:The several entries in
  the first column that together sum to 11 (i.e., 8, 2, and 1) are checked off. The
  product is then found by adding up the multiples corresponding to these entries;
  thus, 224 + 56 + 28 = 308, the desired product.To divide 308 by 28, the Egyptians
  applied the same procedure in reverse. Using the same table as in the multiplication
  problem, one can see that 8 produces the largest multiple of 28 that is less then
  308 (for the entry at 16 is already 448), and 8 is checked off. The process is then
  repeated, this time for the remainder (84) obtained by subtracting the entry at
  8 (224) from the original number (308). This, however, is already smaller than the
  entry at 4, which consequently is ignored, but it is greater than the entry at 2
  (56), which is then checked off. The process is repeated again for the remainder
  obtained by subtracting 56 from the previous remainder of 84, or 28, which also
  happens to exactly equal the entry at 1 and which is then checked off. The entries
  that have been checked off are added up, yielding the quotient: 8 + 2 + 1 = 11.
  (In most cases, of course, there is a remainder that is less than the divisor.)For
  larger numbers this procedure can be improved by considering multiples of one of
  the factors by 10, 20,…or even by higher orders of magnitude (100, 1,000,…), as
  necessary (in the Egyptian decimal notation, these multiples are easy to work out).
  Thus, one can find the product of 28 by 27 by setting out the multiples of 28 by
  1, 2, 4, 8, 10, and 20. Since the entries 1, 2, 4, and 20 add up to 27, one has
  only to add up the corresponding multiples to find the answer.Computations involving
  fractions are carried out under the restriction to unit parts (that is, fractions
  that in modern notation are written with 1 as the numerator). To express the result
  of dividing 4 by 7, for instance, which in modern notation is simply 4/7, the scribe
  wrote 1/2 + 1/14. The procedure for finding quotients in this form merely extends
  the usual method for the division of integers, where one now inspects the entries
  for 2/3, 1/3, 1/6, etc., and 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, etc., until the corresponding multiples
  of the divisor sum to the dividend. (The scribes included 2/3, one may observe,
  even though it is not a unit fraction.) In practice the procedure can sometimes
  become quite complicated (for example, the value for 2/29 is given in the Rhind
  papyrus as 1/24 + 1/58 + 1/174 + 1/232) and can be worked out in different ways
  (for example, the same 2/29 might be found as 1/15 + 1/435 or as 1/16 + 1/232 +
  1/464, etc.). A considerable portion of the papyrus texts is devoted to tables to
  facilitate the finding of such unit-fraction values.These elementary operations
  are all that one needs for solving the arithmetic problems in the papyri. For example,
  “to divide 6 loaves among 10 men” (Rhind papyrus, problem 3), one merely divides
  to get the answer 1/2 + 1/10. In one group of problems an interesting trick is used:
  “A quantity (aha) and its 7th together make 19—what is it?” (Rhind papyrus, problem
  24). Here one first supposes the quantity to be 7: since 11/7 of it becomes 8, not
  19, one takes 19/8 (that is, 2 + 1/4 + 1/8), and its multiple by 7 (16 + 1/2 + 1/8)
  becomes the required answer. This type of procedure (sometimes called the method
  of “false position” or “false assumption”) is familiar in many other arithmetic
  traditions (e.g., the Chinese, Hindu, Muslim, and Renaissance European), although
  they appear to have no direct link to the Egyptian.The geometric problems in the
  papyri seek measurements of figures, like rectangles and triangles of given base
  and height, by means of suitable arithmetic operations. In a more complicated problem,
  a rectangle is sought whose area is 12 and whose height is 1/2 + 1/4 times its base
  (Golenishchev papyrus, problem 6). To solve the problem, the ratio is inverted and
  multiplied by the area, yielding 16; the square root of the result (4) is the base
  of the rectangle, and 1/2 + 1/4 times 4, or 3, is the height. The entire process
  is analogous to the process of solving the algebraic equation for the problem (x × 3/4x = 12),
  though without the use of a letter for the unknown. An interesting procedure is
  used to find the area of the circle (Rhind papyrus, problem 50): 1/9 of the diameter
  is discarded, and the result is squared. For example, if the diameter is 9, the
  area is set equal to 64. The scribe recognized that the area of a circle is proportional
  to the square of the diameter and assumed for the constant of proportionality (that
  is, π/4) the value 64/81. This is a rather good estimate, being about 0.6 percent
  too large. (It is not as close, however, as the now common estimate of 31/7, first
  proposed by Archimedes, which is only about 0.04 percent too large.) But there is
  nothing in the papyri indicating that the scribes were aware that this rule was
  only approximate rather than exact.A remarkable result is the rule for the volume
  of the truncated pyramid (Golenishchev papyrus, problem 14). The scribe assumes
  the height to be 6, the base to be a square of side 4, and the top a square of side
  2. He multiplies one-third the height times 28, finding the volume to be 56; here
  28 is computed from 2 × 2 + 2 × 4 + 4 × 4. Since this is correct, it can be assumed
  that the scribe also knew the general rule: A = (h/3)(a2 + ab + b2). How the scribes
  actually derived the rule is a matter for debate, but it is reasonable to suppose
  that they were aware of related rules, such as that for the volume of a pyramid:
  one-third the height times the area of the base.The Egyptians employed the equivalent
  of similar triangles to measure distances. For instance, the seked of a pyramid
  is stated as the number of palms in the horizontal corresponding to a rise of one
  cubit (seven palms). (See the figure.) Thus, if the seked is 51/4 and the base is
  140 cubits, the height becomes 931/3 cubits (Rhind papyrus, problem 57). The Greek
  sage Thales of Miletus (6th century bc) is said to have measured the height of pyramids
  by means of their shadows (the report derives from Hieronymus, a disciple of Aristotle
  in the 4th century bc). In light of the seked computations, however, this report
  must indicate an aspect of Egyptian surveying that extended back at least 1,000
  years before the time of Thales.The papyri thus bear witness to a mathematical tradition
  closely tied to the practical accounting and surveying activities of the scribes.
  Occasionally, the scribes loosened up a bit: one problem (Rhind papyrus, problem
  79), for example, seeks the total from seven houses, seven cats per house, seven
  mice per cat, seven ears of wheat per mouse, and seven hekat of grain per ear (result:
  19,607). Certainly the scribe’s interest in progressions (for which he appears to
  have a rule) goes beyond practical considerations. Other than this, however, Egyptian
  mathematics falls firmly within the range of practice.Even allowing for the scantiness
  of the documentation that survives, the Egyptian achievement in mathematics must
  be viewed as modest. Its most striking features are competence and continuity. The
  scribes managed to work out the basic arithmetic and geometry necessary for their
  official duties as civil managers, and their methods persisted with little evident
  change for at least a millennium, perhaps two. Indeed, when Egypt came under Greek
  domination in the Hellenistic period (from the 3rd century bc onward), the older
  school methods continued. Quite remarkably, the older unit-fraction methods are
  still prominent in Egyptian school papyri written in the demotic (Egyptian) and
  Greek languages as late as the 7th century ad, for example.To the extent that Egyptian
  mathematics left a legacy at all, it was through its impact on the emerging Greek
  mathematical tradition between the 6th and 4th centuries bc. Because the documentation
  from this period is limited, the manner and significance of the influence can only
  be conjectured. But the report about Thales measuring the height of pyramids is
  only one of several such accounts of Greek intellectuals learning from Egyptians;
  Herodotus and Plato describe with approval Egyptian practices in the teaching and
  application of mathematics. This literary evidence has historical support, since
  the Greeks maintained continuous trade and military operations in Egypt from the
  7th century bc onward. It is thus plausible that basic precedents for the Greeks’
  earliest mathematical efforts—how they dealt with fractional parts or measured areas
  and volumes, or their use of ratios in connection with similar figures—came from
  the learning of the ancient Egyptian scribes.\r\n        While every effort has
