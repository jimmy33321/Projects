Thanks to Beeker and his student team, the 1699 pirate ship of the infamous Captain Kidd was converted to the Captain Kidd Shipwreck Living Museum of the Sea at the bottom of the Caribbean—one among many historic vessels the team has discovered and coverted for public use. Students in the Academic Diving Program at the IU School of Public Health-Bloomington are leagues above your average research scientists—going the extra mile to become certified divers. Check out the IU Underwater Science program on Facebook to see what student divers are uncovering now.An IU student researcher inspects a cannon from the Captain Kidd shipwreckThe first job I ever remember wanting to have was discovering more constellations.Miranda Barnett, IU studentRead Miranda’s storyA lab for every passion under the sunIn hundreds of small and large research labs, centers, and institutes in every subject imaginable, we’re changing the traditional methods of approaching problems—like in the IU Creativity Labs, where students and faculty are designing new ways to teach children electronics, math, music, and science.

  Programs like IU STARS (Science, Technology, and Research Scholars) and the Cox Research Scholars Program give students four years of faculty-mentored research experiences, while external competitions and experiences like the School of Informatics and Computing capstone projects showcase IU students’ imagination and ingenuity. Can’t wait to get your feet wet? Students can delve into research before the first semester at IU, through programs like the Integrated Freshman Learning Experience.Professor Kylie Peppler from the IU Creativity Labs uses simple crafting materials to make electronics accessible to children.Professor Linda Smith’s Cognitive Development Lab is revolutionizing our understanding of how brains develop.With superpowered technologyOur technology centers aren’t just awe-inspiring. They’re essential tools in our reseach and creative work. At other top-tier research universities, massive supercomputers like our Big Red II are typically reserved for faculty. But IU gives students access to supercomputing and to some of the best IT and technology resources in the nation.

  science. Thanks to Beeker and his student team, the 1699 pirate ship of the infamous
  Captain Kidd was converted to the Captain Kidd Shipwreck Living Museum of the Sea
  at the bottom of the Caribbean—one among many historic vessels the team has discovered
  and coverted for public use. Students in the Academic Diving Program at the IU School
  of Public Health-Bloomington are leagues above your average research scientists—going
  the extra mile to become certified divers. Check out the IU Underwater Science program
  on Facebook to see what student divers are uncovering now.The first job I ever remember
  wanting to have was discovering more constellations.In hundreds of small and large
  research labs, centers, and institutes in every subject imaginable, we’re changing
  the traditional methods of approaching problems—like in the IU Creativity Labs,
  where students and faculty are designing new ways to teach children electronics,
  math, music, and science.Programs like IU STARS (Science, Technology, and Research
  Scholars) and the Cox Research Scholars Program give students four years of faculty-mentored
  research experiences, while external competitions and experiences like the School
  of Informatics and Computing capstone projects showcase IU students’ imagination
  and ingenuity. Can’t wait to get your feet wet? Students can delve into research
  before the first semester at IU, through programs like the Integrated Freshman Learning
  Experience.Our technology centers aren’t just awe-inspiring. They’re essential tools
  in our reseach and creative work. At other top-tier research universities, massive
  supercomputers like our Big Red II are typically reserved for faculty. But IU gives
  students access to supercomputing and to some of the best IT and technology resources
  in the nation.Technology wonderlands like the IU Advanced Visualization Lab allow
  you to develop your expertise with research tools like 3-D modeling.At IU, they’re
  likely working together on the same research project. Our research culture is driven
  by the understanding that our most successful work combines ideas from diverse subject
  areas.Think of the IU research environment like a dating pool, and imagine that
  pool is the size of an ocean. And then add an atmosphere of openness and inclusiveness,
  and you’ll get an idea of how easy it is to expand your horizons here—through research
  connections you never thought were possible.Research experiences build your confidence
  and give you an edge in the employment market. Many IU students have used their
  research backgrounds to create new technologies or new companies—before they even
  graduate.Whether you’re on the road to becoming IU’s next great environmental advocate,
  social media scholar, or robot designer—the world is waiting for your contribution.Indiana

  a deep-sea expedition to examine an ancient shipwreck is just a day in the life
  for IU students in Professor Charles Beeker’s program in underwater science. Thanks
  to Beeker and his student team, the 1699 pirate ship of the infamous Captain Kidd
  was converted to the Captain Kidd Shipwreck Living Museum of the Sea at the bottom
  of the Caribbean—one among many historic vessels the team has discovered and coverted
  for public use. Students in the Academic Diving Program at the IU School of Public
  Health-Bloomington are leagues above your average research scientists—going the
  extra mile to become certified divers. Check out the IU Underwater Science program
  on Facebook to see what student divers are uncovering now.An IU student researcher

  storyA lab for every passion under the sunIn hundreds of small and large research
  labs, centers, and institutes in every subject imaginable, we’re changing the traditional
  methods of approaching problems—like in the IU Creativity Labs, where students and
  faculty are designing new ways to teach children electronics, math, music, and science.\nPrograms
  like IU STARS (Science, Technology, and Research Scholars) and the Cox Research
  Scholars Program give students four years of faculty-mentored research experiences,
  while external competitions and experiences like the School of Informatics and Computing
  capstone projects showcase IU students’ imagination and ingenuity. Can’t wait to
  get your feet wet? Students can delve into research before the first semester at
  IU, through programs like the Integrated Freshman Learning Experience.Professor
  Kylie Peppler from the IU Creativity Labs uses simple crafting materials to make
  electronics accessible to children.Professor Linda Smith’s Cognitive Development
  Lab is revolutionizing our understanding of how brains develop.With superpowered
  technologyOur technology centers aren’t just awe-inspiring. They’re essential tools
  in our reseach and creative work. At other top-tier research universities, massive
  supercomputers like our Big Red II are typically reserved for faculty. But IU gives
  students access to supercomputing and to some of the best IT and technology resources
  in the nation.\nTechnology wonderlands like the IU Advanced Visualization Lab allow
  you to develop your expertise with research tools like 3-D modeling.IU students
  use visualization technology for a video art project.What do a music student, an
  informatics student, and an anthropology student have in common?At IU, they’re likely
  working together on the same research project. Our research culture is driven by
  the understanding that our most successful work combines ideas from diverse subject
  areas.\nThink of the IU research environment like a dating pool, and imagine that
  pool is the size of an ocean. And then add an atmosphere of openness and inclusiveness,
  and you’ll get an idea of how easy it is to expand your horizons here—through research
  connections you never thought were possible.Research experiences build your confidence
  and give you an edge in the employment market. Many IU students have used their
  research backgrounds to create new technologies or new companies—before they even
  graduate.Get your ideas out thereWhether you’re on the road to becoming IU’s next
