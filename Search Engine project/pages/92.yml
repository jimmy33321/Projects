  The
- |
  Branches of Science:
- |
   
- |
   
- |
  Science is the study of the
- |
  world and how
- |
  it works. The types of questions that a scientist may study can
- |
  range
- |
  from “How is the leg of a fly connected to its body” to “How did the
- |
  universe
- |
  begin” or even “Why do people choose the marriage partners they do”. No
- |
  one
- "scientist can study every aspect of this world we live in. \n"
- |
   
- |
  As with many complex things, the questions that
- |
  scientists
- |
  study are often grouped into related
- |
  categories. These
- |
  groupings allow scientists to focus on a set of similar topics and
- |
  interact
- |
  with others who are interested in the same questions. The groupings
- |
  also make
- |
  science much easier to comprehend for students. Students can learn the
- |
  basic
- |
  principles involved in one aspect of the world without being
- |
  overwhelmed with
- "the entire scientific body of knowledge. \n"
- |
   
- |
  There are many possible ways to organize science
- |
  into basic
- |
  groupings. If you look in textbooks and on the internet, you will find
- |
  several
- |
  different organizational schemes. Each of the methods of grouping
- |
  science has
- |
  its benefits and weaknesses and no single method stands out as the
- |
  “correct”
- |
  method. Here we describe one method that includes a very broad view of
- |
  science
- |
  including some fields that are not typically
- |
  discussed
- "in the organizational schemes. \n"
- |
   
- |
  In this organizational scheme, all of science is divided into three major branches. Each major
- |
  branch can be separated into sub-branches
- |
  and each sub-branch
- |
  contains many specific fields of study. The figure below shows the
- |
  overall
- "layout of the major and sub-branches. \n"
- |
   
- |2+

- |
  Formal Science is the branch of science dealing
- |
  with
- |
  abstract concepts. It includes the sub-branches of logic and
- |
  mathematics. For
- |
  most scientists, these branches serve as tools to
- |
  better
- |
  understand their own fields of study. For example, a physicist
- |
  may use
- |
  algebra and geometry to help them understand the path of an arrow
- |
  through the
- |
  air. Much of the mathematics and logic that we commonly use have
- |
  been understood for centuries. We must remember, however, that
- |
  at some
- |
  point in history someone had to discover that the sum of the angles in
- |
  a
- |
  triangle equals 180 degrees. Mathematicians are still working to
- |
  understand the
- |
  complex relationships involved in large numbers, the geometry of curved
- |
  surfaces, and prime numbers. The new discoveries are
- |
  being
- "used as tools for things like encryption for computer security. \n"
- |
   
- |
  Natural Science is the major branch most commonly
- |
  recognized
- |
  as “science”. It is the branch of science dealing with the natural
- |
  world. The
- |
  sub-branches in natural science include the physical sciences and the
- |
  biological sciences. The physical sciences sub-branch deals with the
- |
  physical
- |
  universe of matter, space, time, and energy. Within the physical
- |
  sciences are
- |
  fields of study such as physics, chemistry, geology, astronomy, as well
- |
  as many
- |
  others. The biological science sub-branch (sometimes
- |
  called
- |
  life science) deals with living organisms. Within the biological
- |
  sciences are
- |
  fields of study such as biology, zoology, genetics, botany, as well as
- |
  many
- "others. \n"
- |
   
- |
  Humanistic Science is the major branch dealing
- |
  with the
- |
  interaction between people and the world. It is
- |
  sometimes
- |
  also referred to as Cultural Science. The sub-branches in the
- |
  humanistic
- |
  sciences include behavioral science and social science. Behavioral
- |
  science
- |
  includes the field of psychology. Social science includes sociology,
- |
  political
- |
  science, and economics.  Many of the
- |
  fields of study within the humanistic sciences involve interactions
- |
  between the
- |
  behavioral and social sciences.  Like all
- |
  sciences, the fields of study that qualify for behavioral and social
- |
  science
- |
  must apply the general scientific method. Although the official
- |
  definition
- |
  deals with people, the humanistic sciences are
- |
  also being
- "applied to other animals such as chimpanzees and dolphins. \n"

rawText: "\n\nThe\nBranches of Science:\n \n \nScience is the study of the\nworld
  and how\nit works. The types of questions that a scientist may study can\nrange\nfrom
  “How is the leg of a fly connected to its body” to “How did the\nuniverse\nbegin”
  or even “Why do people choose the marriage partners they do”. No\none\nscientist
  can study every aspect of this world we live in. \n \nAs with many complex things,
  the questions that\nscientists\nstudy are often grouped into related\ncategories.
  These\ngroupings allow scientists to focus on a set of similar topics and\ninteract\nwith
  others who are interested in the same questions. The groupings\nalso make\nscience
  much easier to comprehend for students. Students can learn the\nbasic\nprinciples
  involved in one aspect of the world without being\noverwhelmed with\nthe entire
  scientific body of knowledge. \n \nThere are many possible ways to organize science\ninto
  basic\ngroupings. If you look in textbooks and on the internet, you will find\nseveral\ndifferent
  organizational schemes. Each of the methods of grouping\nscience has\nits benefits
  and weaknesses and no single method stands out as the\n“correct”\nmethod. Here we
  describe one method that includes a very broad view of\nscience\nincluding some
  fields that are not typically\ndiscussed\nin the organizational schemes. \n \nIn
  this organizational scheme, all of science is divided into three major branches.
  Each major\nbranch can be separated into sub-branches\nand each sub-branch\ncontains
  many specific fields of study. The figure below shows the\noverall\nlayout of the
  major and sub-branches. \n \n\nFormal Science is the branch of science dealing\nwith\nabstract
  concepts. It includes the sub-branches of logic and\nmathematics. For\nmost scientists,
  these branches serve as tools to\nbetter\nunderstand their own fields of study.
  For example, a physicist\nmay use\nalgebra and geometry to help them understand
  the path of an arrow\nthrough the\nair. Much of the mathematics and logic that we
  commonly use have\nbeen understood for centuries. We must remember, however, that\nat
  some\npoint in history someone had to discover that the sum of the angles in\na\ntriangle
  equals 180 degrees. Mathematicians are still working to\nunderstand the\ncomplex
  relationships involved in large numbers, the geometry of curved\nsurfaces, and prime
  numbers. The new discoveries are\nbeing\nused as tools for things like encryption
  for computer security. \n \nNatural Science is the major branch most commonly\nrecognized\nas
  “science”. It is the branch of science dealing with the natural\nworld. The\nsub-branches
  in natural science include the physical sciences and the\nbiological sciences. The
  physical sciences sub-branch deals with the\nphysical\nuniverse of matter, space,
  time, and energy. Within the physical\nsciences are\nfields of study such as physics,
  chemistry, geology, astronomy, as well\nas many\nothers. The biological science
  sub-branch (sometimes\ncalled\nlife science) deals with living organisms. Within
  the biological\nsciences are\nfields of study such as biology, zoology, genetics,
  botany, as well as\nmany\nothers. \n \nHumanistic Science is the major branch dealing\nwith
  the\ninteraction between people and the world. It is\nsometimes\nalso referred to
  as Cultural Science. The sub-branches in the\nhumanistic\nsciences include behavioral
  science and social science. Behavioral\nscience\nincludes the field of psychology.
  Social science includes sociology,\npolitical\nscience, and economics.  Many of
  the\nfields of study within the humanistic sciences involve interactions\nbetween
  the\nbehavioral and social sciences.  Like all\nsciences, the fields of study that
  qualify for behavioral and social\nscience\nmust apply the general scientific method.
  Although the official\ndefinition\ndeals with people, the humanistic sciences are\nalso
  being\napplied to other animals such as chimpanzees and dolphins. \n\nThe\nBranches
