  J. Toynbee April 17, 1955. NBC television broadcast.The PsychohistorianIf a science
  of history were achieved, it would, like the science of celestial mechanics, make
  possible the calculable prediction of the future in history. It would bring the
  totality of historical occurrences within a single field and reveal the unfolding
  future to its last end, including all the apparent choices made and to be made.
  It would be omniscience. The creator of it would possess the attributes ascribed
  by the theologians to God. The future once revealed, humanity would have nothing
  to do except to await its doom.—Charles Austin Beard.\r\n"

  real solemn history, I cannot be interested in. I read it a little as a duty, but
  it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me. The quarrels of popes

  1803. Northanger Abbey.The major lessons of history? There are four: First, whom
  the gods destroy they first make mad with power. Second, the mills of God grind
  slowly, but they grind exceeding small. Third, the bee fertilizes the flower it

- "}History is the study of the human past as it is described in the written documents
  left by human beings. Here are a collection of more history definitions.—Kris HirstHistory
  is a narration of the events which have happened among mankind, including an account
  of the rise and fall of nations, as well as of other great changes which have affected
  the political and social condition of the human race.—John J. Anderson. 1876. A
  Manual of General History.History is not what you thought. It is what you remember.
  All other history defeats itself.—W. C. Sellar and R. J. Yeatman. 1930 Preface,
  1066 and All That.History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to
  awake.—James Joyce. Ulysses. 1922(1988) Published by Oxford University Press. P.
  34History not used is nothing, for all intellectual life is action, like practical
  life, and if you don't use the stuff well, it might as well be dead.—Arnold J. Toynbee
  April 17, 1955. NBC television broadcast.If a science of history were achieved,
  it would, like the science of celestial mechanics, make possible the calculable
  prediction of the future in history. It would bring the totality of historical occurrences
  within a single field and reveal the unfolding future to its last end, including
  all the apparent choices made and to be made. It would be omniscience. The creator
  of it would possess the attributes ascribed by the theologians to God. The future
  once revealed, humanity would have nothing to do except to await its doom.—Charles
  Austin Beard. 1933. \"Written History as an Act of Fate.\" Annual address of the
  president of the American Historical Association, delivered at Urbana, Illinois.
  December 28, 1933. American Historical Review 39(2):219-231.History is and should

  worker of the Israeli Antiquity Authority sews fragments of the Dead Sea scrolls
  which includes biblical verses in a preservation laboratory of the Israel Museum
  in Jerusalem. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEddie Gerald / Moment Mobile / Getty Museum\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tHistory
  is the study of the human past as it is described in the written documents left
  by human beings. Here are a collection of more history definitions.—Kris HirstHistory
  DefinitionHistory is a narration of the events which have happened among mankind,
  including an account of the rise and fall of nations, as well as of other great
  changes which have affected the political and social condition of the human race.—John
  J.\r\n\r\n\t\t Anderson. 1876. A Manual of General History.History is not what you
  thought. It is what you remember. All other history defeats itself.—W. C. Sellar
  and R. J. Yeatman. 1930 Preface, 1066 and All That.History, Stephen said, is a nightmare
  from which I am trying to awake.—James Joyce. Ulysses. 1922(1988) Published by Oxford
  University Press.\r\n\r\n\t\t P. 34History not used is nothing, for all intellectual
  life is action, like practical life, and if you don't use the stuff well, it might
  as well be dead.—Arnold J. Toynbee April 17, 1955. NBC television broadcast.The
  PsychohistorianIf a science of history were achieved, it would, like the science
  of celestial mechanics, make possible the calculable prediction of the future in
  history. It would bring the totality of historical occurrences within a single field
  and reveal the unfolding future to its last end, including all the apparent choices
  made and to be made. It would be omniscience. The creator of it would possess the
  attributes ascribed by the theologians to God. The future once revealed, humanity
  would have nothing to do except to await its doom.—Charles Austin Beard.\r\n\r\n\t\t
  1933. \"Written History as an Act of Fate.\" Annual address of the president of
  the American Historical Association, delivered at Urbana, Illinois. December 28,
  1933. American Historical Review 39(2):219-231.History is and should be a science.
  .... History is not the accumulation of events of every kind which happened in the
  past.\r\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\r\n\t\t It is the science of human societies.—Fustel
  de CoulangesThe first foundations of all history are the recitals of the fathers
  to the children, transmitted afterward from one generation to another; at their
  origin they are at the very most probable, when they do not shock common sense,
  and they lose one degree of probability in each generation.—Voltaire [1694-1778].
  The Philosophical Dictionary. translated 1924 by H.I. WoolfHistory is ... a dialogue
  between the present and the past. (originally: Geschichte ist ... ein Dialog zwischen
  Gegenwart und Vergangenheit.)— Edward Hallet Carr. 1961. What Is History? New York:
  Vintage Books.HISTORY, n. An account mostly false, of events mostly unimportant,
  which are brought about by rulers mostly knaves, and soldiers mostly fools: Of Roman
  history, great Niebuhr's shown 'Tis nine-tenths lying. Faith, I wish 'twere known,
  Ere we accept great Niebuhr as a guide, Wherein he blundered and how much he lied.
  (Salder Bupp) —Ambrose Bierce. 1911. Devil's DictionaryA Pack of TricksHistory is
  nothing but a pack of tricks we play on the dead. (French original) J'ay vu un temps
  où vous n'aimiez guères l'histoire. Ce n'est après tout qu'un ramas de tracasseries
  qu'on fait aux morts...) —Voltaire (Francois Marie Arouet). 1757. Letter to Pierre
  Robert Le Cornier de Cideville. In Voltaire's Correspondence vol. xxxi. edited by
  Theodore Besterman, 1958. GenevaHistory, real solemn history, I cannot be interested
  in. I read it a little as a duty, but it tells me nothing that does not either vex
  or weary me. The quarrels of popes and kings, with wars or pestilences, in every
  page; the men all so good for nothing, and hardly any women at all—it is very tiresome.—
  Catherine Morland [Jane Austen]. 1803. Northanger Abbey.The major lessons of history?
  There are four: First, whom the gods destroy they first make mad with power. Second,
  the mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceeding small. Third, the bee fertilizes
  the flower it robs. Fourth, when it is dark enough you can see the stars.—Although
  this quote has been attributed to historian Charles Austin Beard I couldn't find
  an original source. This version is the one Martin Luther King used in \"The death
  of evil upon the seashore\" in Strength to Love, 1981. Fortress Press, p. 83History
  Definition for the CrankyMost events recorded in history are more remarkable than
  important, like eclipses of the sun and moon, by which all are attracted, but whose
  effects no one takes the trouble to calculate.—Henry David Thoreau. 1849. A Week
  on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers.After such knowledge, what forgiveness? Think
  nowHistory has many cunning passages, contrived corridorsAnd issues, deceives with
  whispering ambitions,Guides us by vanities. Think nowShe gives when our attention
  is distractedAnd what she gives, gives with such supple confusionsThat the giving
  famishes the craving. Gives too lateWhat's not believed in, or if still believed,In
  memory only, reconsidered passion. Gives too soonInto weak hands, what's thought
  can be dispensed withTill the refusal propagates a fear. ThinkNeither fear nor courage
  saves us. Unnatural vicesAre fathered by our heroism. VirtuesAre forced upon us
  by our impudent crimes.These tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree.—T.S.
  Eliot. 1920 Gerontion. In The Waste Land, Prufrock and Other Poems.So very difficult
  a matter it is to trace and find out the truth of anything by history. —Plutarch.

  is the study of the human past as it is described in the written documents left
  by human beings. Here are a collection of more history definitions.—Kris HirstHistory
  is a narration of the events which have happened among mankind, including an account
  of the rise and fall of nations, as well as of other great changes which have affected
  the political and social condition of the human race.—John J. Anderson. 1876. A
  Manual of General History.History is not what you thought. It is what you remember.
  All other history defeats itself.—W. C. Sellar and R. J. Yeatman. 1930 Preface,
  1066 and All That.History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to
  awake.—James Joyce. Ulysses. 1922(1988) Published by Oxford University Press. P.
  34History not used is nothing, for all intellectual life is action, like practical
  life, and if you don't use the stuff well, it might as well be dead.—Arnold J. Toynbee
  April 17, 1955. NBC television broadcast.If a science of history were achieved,
  it would, like the science of celestial mechanics, make possible the calculable
  prediction of the future in history. It would bring the totality of historical occurrences
  within a single field and reveal the unfolding future to its last end, including
  all the apparent choices made and to be made. It would be omniscience. The creator
  of it would possess the attributes ascribed by the theologians to God. The future
  once revealed, humanity would have nothing to do except to await its doom.—Charles
  Austin Beard. 1933. \"Written History as an Act of Fate.\" Annual address of the
  president of the American Historical Association, delivered at Urbana, Illinois.
  December 28, 1933. American Historical Review 39(2):219-231.History is and should
  be a science. .... History is not the accumulation of events of every kind which
  happened in the past. It is the science of human societies.—Fustel de CoulangesThe
  first foundations of all history are the recitals of the fathers to the children,
  transmitted afterward from one generation to another; at their origin they are at
  the very most probable, when they do not shock common sense, and they lose one degree
  of probability in each generation.—Voltaire [1694-1778]. The Philosophical Dictionary.
  translated 1924 by H.I. WoolfHistory is ... a dialogue between the present and the
  past. (originally: Geschichte ist ... ein Dialog zwischen Gegenwart und Vergangenheit.)—
  Edward Hallet Carr. 1961. What Is History? New York: Vintage Books.HISTORY, n. An
  account mostly false, of events mostly unimportant, which are brought about by rulers
  mostly knaves, and soldiers mostly fools: Of Roman history, great Niebuhr's shown
  'Tis nine-tenths lying. Faith, I wish 'twere known, Ere we accept great Niebuhr
  as a guide, Wherein he blundered and how much he lied. (Salder Bupp) —Ambrose Bierce.
  1911. Devil's DictionaryHistory is nothing but a pack of tricks we play on the dead.
  (French original) J'ay vu un temps où vous n'aimiez guères l'histoire. Ce n'est
  après tout qu'un ramas de tracasseries qu'on fait aux morts...) —Voltaire (Francois
  Marie Arouet). 1757. Letter to Pierre Robert Le Cornier de Cideville. In Voltaire's
  Correspondence vol. xxxi. edited by Theodore Besterman, 1958. GenevaHistory, real
  solemn history, I cannot be interested in. I read it a little as a duty, but it
  tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me. The quarrels of popes and
  kings, with wars or pestilences, in every page; the men all so good for nothing,
  and hardly any women at all—it is very tiresome.— Catherine Morland [Jane Austen].
  1803. Northanger Abbey.The major lessons of history? There are four: First, whom
  the gods destroy they first make mad with power. Second, the mills of God grind
  slowly, but they grind exceeding small. Third, the bee fertilizes the flower it
  robs. Fourth, when it is dark enough you can see the stars.—Although this quote
  has been attributed to historian Charles Austin Beard I couldn't find an original
  source. This version is the one Martin Luther King used in \"The death of evil upon
  the seashore\" in Strength to Love, 1981. Fortress Press, p. 83Most events recorded
  in history are more remarkable than important, like eclipses of the sun and moon,
  by which all are attracted, but whose effects no one takes the trouble to calculate.—Henry
  David Thoreau. 1849. A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers.After such knowledge,
  what forgiveness? Think nowHistory has many cunning passages, contrived corridorsAnd
  issues, deceives with whispering ambitions,Guides us by vanities. Think nowShe gives
  when our attention is distractedAnd what she gives, gives with such supple confusionsThat
  the giving famishes the craving. Gives too lateWhat's not believed in, or if still
  believed,In memory only, reconsidered passion. Gives too soonInto weak hands, what's
  thought can be dispensed withTill the refusal propagates a fear. ThinkNeither fear
  nor courage saves us. Unnatural vicesAre fathered by our heroism. VirtuesAre forced
  upon us by our impudent crimes.These tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree.—T.S.
  Eliot. 1920 Gerontion. In The Waste Land, Prufrock and Other Poems.So very difficult
  a matter it is to trace and find out the truth of anything by history. —Plutarch.
