  Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme
- |
  beautya beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal
- |
  to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of
- |
  painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection
- |
  such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the
- |
  exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of
- |
  the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in
- |
  poetry.

  THERE IS A story about two friends, who were classmates in high school,
- |
  talking about their jobs. One of them became a statistician and was
- |
  working on population trends. He showed a reprint to his former
- |
  classmate. The reprint started, as usual, with the Gaussian distribution
- |
  and the statistician explained to his former classmate the meaning of
- |
  the symbols for the actual population, for the average population, and
- |
  so on. His classmate was a bit incredulous and was not quite sure
- |
  whether the statistician was pulling his leg. "How can you know that?"
- |
  was his query. "And what is this symbol here?" "Oh," said the
- |
  statistician, "this is pi." "What is that?" "The ratio of the
- |
  circumference of the circle to its diameter." "Well, now you are pushing
- |
  your joke too far," said the classmate, "surely the population has
- |
  nothing to do with the circumference of the circle."
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Naturally, we are inclined to smile about the simplicity of the
- |
  classmate's approach. Nevertheless, when I heard this story, I had to
- |
  admit to an eerie feeling because, surely, the reaction of the classmate
- |
  betrayed only plain common sense. I was even more confused when, not
- |
  many days later, someone came to me and expressed his bewilderment
- |
  [1 The remark to be quoted was made by F. Werner when he was a student in
- "Princeton.] \n"
- |
  with the fact that we make a rather narrow selection when choosing the data
- |
  on which we test our theories. "How do we know that, if we made a theory
- |
  which focuses its attention on phenomena we disregard and disregards
- |
  some of the phenomena now commanding our attention, that we could not
- |
  build another theory which has little in common with the present one but
- |
  which, nevertheless, explains just as many phenomena as the present
- |
  theory?" It has to be admitted that we have no definite evidence that
- |
  there is no such theory.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The preceding two stories illustrate the two main points which are the
- |
  subjects of the present discourse. The first point is that mathematical
- |
  concepts turn up in entirely unexpected connections. Moreover, they
- |
  often permit an unexpectedly close and accurate description of the
- |
  phenomena in these connections. Secondly, just because of this
- |
  circumstance, and because we do not understand the reasons of their
- |
  usefulness, we cannot know whether a theory formulated in terms of
- |
  mathematical concepts is uniquely appropriate. We are in a position
- |
  similar to that of a man who was provided with a bunch of keys and who,
- |
  having to open several doors in succession, always hit on the right key
- |
  on the first or second trial. He became skeptical concerning the
- |
  uniqueness of the coordination between keys and doors.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Most of what will be said on these questions will not be new; it has
- |
  probably occurred to most scientists in one form or another. My
- |
  principal aim is to illuminate it from several sides. The first point is
- |
  that the enormous usefulness of mathematics in the natural sciences is
- |
  something bordering on the mysterious and that there is no rational
- |
  explanation for it. Second, it is just this uncanny usefulness of
- |
  mathematical concepts that raises the question of the uniqueness of our
- |
  physical theories. In order to establish the first point, that
- |
  mathematics plays an unreasonably important role in physics, it will be
- |
  useful to say a few words on the question, "What is mathematics?", then,
- |
  "What is physics?", then, how mathematics enters physical theories, and
- |
  last, why the success of mathematics in its role in physics appears so
- |
  baffling. Much less will be said on the second point: the uniqueness of
- |
  the theories of physics. A proper answer to this question would require
- |
  elaborate experimental and theoretical work which has not been
- |
  undertaken to date.

- |
  WHAT IS MATHEMATICS?
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Somebody once said that philosophy is the misuse of a terminology which
- |
  was invented just for this purpose.
- |
  [2 This statement is quoted here from W. Dubislav's Die Philosophie der
- |
  Mathematik in der Gegenwart (Berlin: Junker and Dunnhaupt Verlag, 1932),
- |
  p. 1.] In the same vein, I would say that
- |
  mathematics is the science of skillful operations with concepts and
- |
  rules invented just for this purpose. The principal emphasis is on the
- |
  invention of concepts. Mathematics would soon run out of interesting
- |
  theorems if these had to be formulated in terms of the concepts which
- |
  already appear in the axioms. Furthermore, whereas it is unquestionably
- |
  true that the concepts of elementary mathematics and particularly
- |
  elementary geometry were formulated to describe entities which are
- |
  directly suggested by the actual world, the same does not seem to be
- |
  true of the more advanced concepts, in particular the concepts which
- |
  play such an important role in physics. Thus, the rules for operations
- |
  with pairs of numbers are obviously designed to give the same results as
- |
  the operations with fractions which we first learned without reference
- |
  to "pairs of numbers." The rules for the operations with sequences, that
- |
  is, with irrational numbers, still belong to the category of rules which
- |
  were determined so as to reproduce rules for the operations with
- |
  quantities which were already known to us. Most more advanced
- |
  mathematical concepts, such as complex numbers, algebras, linear
- |
  operators, Borel setsãand this list could be continued almost
- |
  indefinitelyãwere so devised that they are apt subjects on which the
- |
  mathematician can demonstrate his ingenuity and sense of formal beauty.
- |
  In fact, the definition of these concepts, with a realization that
- |
  interesting and ingenious considerations could be applied to them, is
- |
  the first demonstration of the ingeniousness of the mathematician who
- |
  defines them. The depth of thought which goes into the formulation of
- |
  the mathematical concepts is later justified by the skill with which
- |
  these concepts are used. The great mathematician fully, almost
- |
  ruthlessly, exploits the domain of permissible reasoning and skirts the
- |
  impermissible. That his recklessness does not lead him into a morass of
- |
  contradictions is a miracle in itself: certainly it is hard to believe
- |
  that our reasoning power was brought, by Darwin's process of natural
- |
  selection, to the perfection which it seems to possess. However, this is
- |
  not our present subject. The principal point which will have to be
- |
  recalled later is that the mathematician could formulate only a handful
- |
  of interesting theorems without defining concepts beyond those contained
- |
  in the axioms and that the concepts outside those contained in the
- |
  axioms are defined with a view of permitting ingenious logical
- |
  operations which appeal to our aesthetic sense both as operations and
- |
  also in their results of great generality and simplicity.
- |
  [3 M. Polanyi, in his Personal Knowledge (Chicago: University of Chicago
- |
  Press, 1958), says: "All these difficulties are but consequences of our
- |
  refusal to see that mathematics cannot be defined without acknowledging
- |
  its most obvious feature: namely, that it is interesting" (p 188).]
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The complex numbers provide a particularly striking example for the
- |
  foregoing. Certainly, nothing in our experience suggests the
- |
  introduction of these quantities. Indeed, if a mathematician is asked to
- |
  justify his interest in complex numbers, he will point, with some
- |
  indignation, to the many beautiful theorems in the theory of equations,
- |
  of power series, and of analytic functions in general, which owe their
- |
  origin to the introduction of complex numbers. The mathematician is not
- |
  willing to give up his interest in these most beautiful accomplishments
- "of his genius. \n"
- |
  [4 The reader may be interested, in this connection, in Hilbert's rather
- |
  testy remarks about intuitionism which "seeks to break up and to
- |
  disfigure mathematics," Abh. Math. Sem., Univ. Hamburg, 157 (1922), or
- |
  Gesammelte Werke (Berlin: Springer, 1935), p. 188.]

- |
  WHAT IS PHYSICS?
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The physicist is interested in discovering the laws of inanimate nature.
- |
  In order to understand this statement, it is necessary to analyze the
- |
  concept, "law of nature."
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The world around us is of baffling complexity and the most obvious fact
- |
  about it is that we cannot predict the future. Although the joke
- |
  attributes only to the optimist the view that the future is uncertain,
- |
  the optimist is right in this case: the future is unpredictable. It is,
- |
  as Schrodinger has remarked, a miracle that in spite of the baffling
- |
  complexity of the world, certain regularities in the events could be
- |
  discovered. One such regularity, discovered by Galileo, is that two
- |
  rocks, dropped at the same time from the same height, reach the ground
- |
  at the same time. The laws of nature are concerned with such
- |
  regularities. Galileo's regularity is a prototype of a large class of
- |
  regularities. It is a surprising regularity for three reasons.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The first reason that it is surprising is that it is true not only in
- |
  Pisa, and in Galileo's time, it is true everywhere on the Earth, was
- |
  always true, and will always be true. This property of the regularity is
- |
  a recognized invariance property and, as I had occasion to point out
- |
  some time ago, without invariance principles similar to those implied in
- |
  the preceding generalization of Galileo's observation, physics would not
- |
  be possible. The second surprising feature is that the regularity which
- |
  we are discussing is independent of so many conditions which could have
- |
  an effect on it. It is valid no matter whether it rains or not, whether
- |
  the experiment is carried out in a room or from the Leaning Tower, no
- |
  matter whether the person who drops the rocks is a man or a woman. It is
- |
  valid even if the two rocks are dropped, simultaneously and from the
- |
  same height, by two different people. There are, obviously, innumerable
- |
  other conditions which are all immaterial from the point of view of the
- |
  validity of Galileo's regularity. The irrelevancy of so many
- |
  circumstances which could play a role in the phenomenon observed has
- |
  also been called an invariance. However, this invariance is of a
- |
  different character from the preceding one since it cannot be formulated
- |
  as a general principle. The exploration of the conditions which do, and
- |
  which do not, influence a phenomenon is part of the early experimental
- |
  exploration of a field. It is the skill and ingenuity of the
- |
  experimenter which show him phenomena which depend on a relatively
- |
  narrow set of relatively easily realizable and reproducible conditions.
- |
  [5 See, in this connection, the graphic essay of M. Deutsch, Daedalus 87,
- |
  86 (1958). A. Shimony has called my attention to a similar passage in C.
- |
  S. Peirce's Essays in the Philosophy of Science (New York: The Liberal
- |
  Arts Press, 1957), p. 237.]
- |
  In the present case, Galileo's restriction of his observations to
- |
  relatively heavy bodies was the most important step in this regard.
- |
  Again, it is true that if there were no phenomena which are independent
- |
  of all but a manageably small set of conditions, physics would be
- |
  impossible.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The preceding two points, though highly significant from the point of
- |
  view of the philosopher, are not the ones which surprised Galileo most,
- |
  nor do they contain a specific law of nature. The law of nature is
- |
  contained in the statement that the length of time which it takes for a
- |
  heavy object to fall from a given height is independent of the size,
- |
  material, and shape of the body which drops. In the framework of
- |
  Newton's second "law," this amounts to the statement that the
- |
  gravitational force which acts on the falling body is proportional to
- |
  its mass but independent of the size, material, and shape of the body
- |
  which falls.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The preceding discussion is intended to remind us, first, that it is not
- |
  at all natural that "laws of nature" exist, much less that man is able
- |
  to discover them. [6 E. Schrodinger, in his What Is Life? (Cambridge: Cambridge University
- |
  Press, 1945), p. 31, says that this second miracle may well be beyond
- |
  human understanding.]
- |
  The present writer had occasion, some time ago, to
- |
  call attention to the succession of layers of "laws of nature," each
- |
  layer containing more general and more encompassing laws than the
- |
  previous one and its discovery constituting a deeper penetration into
- |
  the structure of the universe than the layers recognized before.
- |
  However, the point which is most significant in the present context is
- |
  that all these laws of nature contain, in even their remotest
- |
  consequences, only a small part of our knowledge of the inanimate world.
- |
  All the laws of nature are conditional statements which permit a
- |
  prediction of some future events on the basis of the knowledge of the
- |
  present, except that some aspects of the present state of the world, in
- |
  practice the overwhelming majority of the determinants of the present
- |
  state of the world, are irrelevant from the point of view of the
- |
  prediction. The irrelevancy is meant in the sense of the second point in
- |
  the discussion of Galileo's theorem.
- |
  [7 The writer feels sure that it is unnecessary to mention that Galileo's
- |
  theorem, as given in the text, does not exhaust the content of Galileo's
- |
  observations in connection with the laws of freely falling bodies.]
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  As regards the present state of the world, such as the existence of the
- |
  earth on which we live and on which Galileo's experiments were
- |
  performed, the existence of the sun and of all our surroundings, the
- |
  laws of nature are entirely silent. It is in consonance with this,
- |
  first, that the laws of nature can be used to predict future events only
- |
  under exceptional circumstancesãwhen all the relevant determinants of
- |
  the present state of the world are known. It is also in consonance with
- |
  this that the construction of machines, the functioning of which he can
- |
  foresee, constitutes the most spectacular accomplishment of the
- |
  physicist. In these machines, the physicist creates a situation in which
- |
  all the relevant coordinates are known so that the behavior of the
- |
  machine can be predicted. Radars and nuclear reactors are examples of
- |
  such machines.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The principal purpose of the preceding discussion is to point out that
- |
  the laws of nature are all conditional statements and they relate only
- |
  to a very small part of our knowledge of the world. Thus, classical
- |
  mechanics, which is the best known prototype of a physical theory, gives
- |
  the second derivatives of the positional coordinates of all bodies, on
- |
  the basis of the knowledge of the positions, etc., of these bodies. It
- |
  gives no information on the existence, the present positions, or
- |
  velocities of these bodies. It should be mentioned, for the sake of
- |
  accuracy, that we discovered about thirty years ago that even the
- |
  conditional statements cannot be entirely precise: that the conditional
- |
  statements are probability laws which enable us only to place
- |
  intelligent bets on future properties of the inanimate world, based on
- |
  the knowledge of the present state. They do not allow us to make
- |
  categorical statements, not even categorical statements conditional on
- |
  the present state of the world. The probabilistic nature of the "laws of
- |
  nature" manifests itself in the case of machines also, and can be
- |
  verified, at least in the case of nuclear reactors, if one runs them at
- |
  very low power. However, the additional limitation of the scope of the
- |
  laws of nature which follows from their probabilistic nature will play
- |
  no role in the rest of the discussion.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- "THE ROLE OF MATHEMATICS IN PHYSICAL THEORIES \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Having refreshed our minds as to the essence of mathematics and physics,
- |
  we should be in a better position to review the role of mathematics in
- |
  physical theories.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Naturally, we do use mathematics in everyday physics to evaluate the
- |
  results of the laws of nature, to apply the conditional statements to
- |
  the particular conditions which happen to prevail or happen to interest
- |
  us. In order that this be possible, the laws of nature must already be
- |
  formulated in mathematical language. However, the role of evaluating the
- |
  consequences of already established theories is not the most important
- |
  role of mathematics in physics. Mathematics, or, rather, applied
- |
  mathematics, is not so much the master of the situation in this
- |
  function: it is merely serving as a tool.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Mathematics does play, however, also a more sovereign role in physics.
- |
  This was already implied in the statement, made when discussing the role
- |
  of applied mathematics, that the laws of nature must have been
- |
  formulated in the language of mathematics to be an object for the use of
- |
  applied mathematics. The statement that the laws of nature are written
- |
  in the language of mathematics was properly made three hundred years
- |
  ago;[8 It is attributed to Galileo]
- |2
   it is now more true than ever before. In order to show the
- |
  importance which mathematical concepts possess in the formulation of the
- |
  laws of physics, let us recall, as an example, the axioms of quantum
- |
  mechanics as formulated, explicitly, by the great physicist, Dirac.
- |
  There are two basic concepts in quantum mechanics: states and
- |
  observables. The states are vectors in Hilbert space, the observables
- |
  self-adjoint operators on these vectors. The possible values of the
- |
  observations are the characteristic values of the operatorsãbut we had
- |
  better stop here lest we engage in a listing of the mathematical
- |
  concepts developed in the theory of linear operators.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It is true, of course, that physics chooses certain mathematical
- |
  concepts for the formulation of the laws of nature, and surely only a
- |
  fraction of all mathematical concepts is used in physics. It is true
- |
  also that the concepts which were chosen were not selected arbitrarily
- |
  from a listing of mathematical terms but were developed, in many if not
- |
  most cases, independently by the physicist and recognized then as having
- |
  been conceived before by the mathematician. It is not true, however, as
- |
  is so often stated, that this had to happen because mathematics uses the
- |
  simplest possible concepts and these were bound to occur in any
- |
  formalism. As we saw before, the concepts of mathematics are not chosen
- |
  for their conceptual simplicityeven sequences of pairs of numbers are
- |
  far from being the simplest conceptsbut for their amenability to clever
- |
  manipulations and to striking, brilliant arguments. Let us not forget
- |
  that the Hilbert space of quantum mechanics is the complex Hilbert
- |
  space, with a Hermitean scalar product. Surely to the unpreoccupied
- |
  mind, complex numbers are far from natural or simple and they cannot be
- |
  suggested by physical observations. Furthermore, the use of complex
- |
  numbers is in this case not a calculational trick of applied mathematics
- |
  but comes close to being a necessity in the formulation of the laws of
- |
  quantum mechanics. Finally, it now begins to appear that not only
- |
  complex numbers but so-called analytic functions are destined to play a
- |
  decisive role in the formulation of quantum theory. I am referring to
- |
  the rapidly developing theory of dispersion relations.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It is difficult to avoid the impression that a miracle confronts us
- |
  here, quite comparable in its striking nature to the miracle that the
- |
  human mind can string a thousand arguments together without getting
- |
  itself into contradictions, or to the two miracles of the existence of
- |
  laws of nature and of the human mind's capacity to divine them. The
- |
  observation which comes closest to an explanation for the mathematical
- |
  concepts' cropping up in physics which I know is Einstein's statement
- |
  that the only physical theories which we are willing to accept are the
- |
  beautiful ones. It stands to argue that the concepts of mathematics,
- |
  which invite the exercise of so much wit, have the quality of beauty.
- |
  However, Einstein's observation can at best explain properties of
- |
  theories which we are willing to believe and has no reference to the
- |
  intrinsic accuracy of the theory. We shall, therefore, turn to this
- |
  latter question.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  IS THE SUCCESS OF PHYSICAL THEORIES TRULY SURPRISING?
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  A possible explanation of the physicist's use of mathematics to
- |
  formulate his laws of nature is that he is a somewhat irresponsible
- |
  person. As a result, when he finds a connection between two quantities
- |
  which resembles a connection well-known from mathematics, he will jump
- |
  at the conclusion that the connection is that discussed in mathematics
- |
  simply because he does not know of any other similar connection. It is
- |
  not the intention of the present discussion to refute the charge that
- |
  the physicist is a somewhat irresponsible person. Perhaps he is.
- |
  However, it is important to point out that the mathematical formulation
- |
  of the physicist's often crude experience leads in an uncanny number of
- |
  cases to an amazingly accurate description of a large class of
- |
  phenomena. This shows that the mathematical language has more to commend
- |
  it than being the only language which we can speak; it shows that it is,
- |
  in a very real sense, the correct language. Let us consider a few
- |
  examples.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The first example is the oft-quoted one of planetary motion. The laws of
- |
  falling bodies became rather well established as a result of experiments
- |
  carried out principally in Italy. These experiments could not be very
- |
  accurate in the sense in which we understand accuracy today partly
- |
  because of the effect of air resistance and partly because of the
- |
  impossibility, at that time, to measure short time intervals.
- |
  Nevertheless, it is not surprising that, as a result of their studies,
- |
  the Italian natural scientists acquired a familiarity with the ways in
- |
  which objects travel through the atmosphere. It was Newton who then
- |
  brought the law of freely falling objects into relation with the motion
- |
  of the moon, noted that the parabola of the thrown rock's path on the
- |
  earth and the circle of the moon's path in the sky are particular cases
- |
  of the same mathematical object of an ellipse, and postulated the
- |
  universal law of gravitation on the basis of a single, and at that time
- |
  very approximate, numerical coincidence. Philosophically, the law of
- |
  gravitation as formulated by Newton was repugnant to his time and to
- |
  himself. Empirically, it was based on very scanty observations. The
- |
  mathematical language in which it was formulated contained the concept
- |
  of a second derivative and those of us who have tried to draw an
- |
  osculating circle to a curve know that the second derivative is not a
- |
  very immediate concept. The law of gravity which Newton reluctantly
- |
  established and which he could verify with an accuracy of about 4% has
- |
  proved to be accurate to less than a ten thousandth of a per cent and
- |
  became so closely associated with the idea of absolute accuracy that
- |
  only recently did physicists become again bold enough to inquire into
- |
  the limitations of its accuracy.
- |
  [9 See, for instance, R. H. Dicke, Am. Sci., 25 (1959).]
- |
  Certainly, the example of Newton's
- |
  law, quoted over and over again, must be mentioned first as a monumental
- |
  example of a law, formulated in terms which appear simple to the
- |
  mathematician, which has proved accurate beyond all reasonable
- |
  expectations. Let us just recapitulate our thesis on this example:
- |
  first, the law, particularly since a second derivative appears in it, is
- |
  simple only to the mathematician, not to common sense or to
- |
  non-mathematically-minded freshmen; second, it is a conditional law of
- |
  very limited scope. It explains nothing about the earth which attracts
- |
  Galileo's rocks, or about the circular form of the moon's orbit, or
- |
  about the planets of the sun. The explanation of these initial
- |
  conditions is left to the geologist and the astronomer, and they have a
- |
  hard time with them.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The second example is that of ordinary, elementary quantum mechanics.
- |
  This originated when Max Born noticed that some rules of computation,
- |
  given by Heisenberg, were formally identical with the rules of
- |
  computation with matrices, established a long time before by
- |
  mathematicians. Born, Jordan, and Heisenberg then proposed to replace by
- |
  matrices the position and momentum variables of the equations of
- |
  classical mechanics. They applied the rules of matrix mechanics to a few
- |
  highly idealized problems and the results were quite satisfactory.
- |
  However, there was, at that time, no rational evidence that their matrix
- |
  mechanics would prove correct under more realistic conditions. Indeed,
- |
  they say "if the mechanics as here proposed should already be correct in
- |
  its essential traits." As a matter of fact, the first application of
- |
  their mechanics to a realistic problem, that of the hydrogen atom, was
- |
  given several months later, by Pauli. This application gave results in
- |
  agreement with experience. This was satisfactory but still
- |
  understandable because Heisenberg's rules of calculation were abstracted
- |
  from problems which included the old theory of the hydrogen atom. The
- |
  miracle occurred only when matrix mechanics, or a mathematically
- |
  equivalent theory, was applied to problems for which Heisenberg's
- |
  calculating rules were meaningless. Heisenberg's rules presupposed that
- |
  the classical equations of motion had solutions with certain periodicity
- |
  properties; and the equations of motion of the two electrons of the
- |
  helium atom, or of the even greater number of electrons of heavier
- |
  atoms, simply do not have these properties, so that Heisenberg's rules
- |
  cannot be applied to these cases. Nevertheless, the calculation of the
- |
  lowest energy level of helium, as carried out a few months ago by
- |
  Kinoshita at Cornell and by Bazley at the Bureau of Standards, agrees
- |
  with the experimental data within the accuracy of the observations,
- |
  which is one part in ten million. Surely in this case we "got something
- |
  out" of the equations that we did not put in.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The same is true of the qualitative characteristics of the "complex
- |
  spectra," that is, the spectra of heavier atoms. I wish to recall a
- |
  conversation with Jordan, who told me, when the qualitative features of
- |
  the spectra were derived, that a disagreement of the rules derived from
- |
  quantum mechanical theory and the rules established by empirical
- |
  research would have provided the last opportunity to make a change in
- |
  the framework of matrix mechanics. In other words, Jordan felt that we
- |
  would have been, at least temporarily, helpless had an unexpected
- |
  disagreement occurred in the theory of the helium atom. This was, at
- |
  that time, developed by Kellner and by Hilleraas. The mathematical
- |
  formalism was too dear and unchangeable so that, had the miracle of
- |
  helium which was mentioned before not occurred, a true crisis would have
- |
  arisen. Surely, physics would have overcome that crisis in one way or
- |
  another. It is true, on the other hand, that physics as we know it today
- |
  would not be possible without a constant recurrence of miracles similar
- |
  to the one of the helium atom, which is perhaps the most striking
- |
  miracle that has occurred in the course of the development of elementary
- |
  quantum mechanics, but by far not the only one. In fact, the number of
- |
  analogous miracles is limited, in our view, only by our willingness to
- |
  go after more similar ones. Quantum mechanics had, nevertheless, many
- |
  almost equally striking successes which gave us the firm conviction that
- |
  it is, what we call, correct.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The last example is that of quantum electrodynamics, or the theory of
- |
  the Lamb shift. Whereas Newton's theory of gravitation still had obvious
- |
  connections with experience, experience entered the formulation of
- |
  matrix mechanics only in the refined or sublimated form of Heisenberg's
- |
  prescriptions. The quantum theory of the Lamb shift, as conceived by
- |
  Bethe and established by Schwinger, is a purely mathematical theory and
- |
  the only direct contribution of experiment was to show the existence of
- |
  a measurable effect. The agreement with calculation is better than one
- |
  part in a thousand.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The preceding three examples, which could be multiplied almost
- |
  indefinitely, should illustrate the appropriateness and accuracy of the
- |
  mathematical formulation of the laws of nature in terms of concepts
- |
  chosen for their manipulability, the "laws of nature" being of almost
- |
  fantastic accuracy but of strictly limited scope. I propose to refer to
- |
  the observation which these examples illustrate as the empirical law of
- |
  epistemology. Together with the laws of invariance of physical theories,
- |
  it is an indispensable foundation of these theories. Without the laws of
- |
  invariance the physical theories could have been given no foundation of
- |
  fact; if the empirical law of epistemology were not correct, we would
- |
  lack the encouragement and reassurance which are emotional necessities,
- |
  without which the "laws of nature" could not have been successfully
- |
  explored. Dr. R. G. Sachs, with whom I discussed the empirical law of
- |
  epistemology, called it an article of faith of the theoretical
- |
  physicist, and it is surely that. However, what he called our article of
- |
  faith can be well supported by actual examplesãmany examples in addition
- |
  to the three which have been mentioned.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- "THE UNIQUENESS OF THE THEORIES OF PHYSICS \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The empirical nature of the preceding observation seems to me to be
- |
  self-evident. It surely is not a "necessity of thought" and it should
- |
  not be necessary, in order to prove this, to point to the fact that it
- |
  applies only to a very small part of our knowledge of the inanimate
- |
  world. It is absurd to believe that the existence of mathematically
- |
  simple expressions for the second derivative of the position is
- |
  self-evident, when no similar expressions for the position itself or for
- |
  the velocity exist. It is therefore surprising how readily the wonderful
- |
  gift contained in the empirical law of epistemology was taken for
- |
  granted. The ability of the human mind to form a string of 1000
- |
  conclusions and still remain "right," which was mentioned before, is a
- |
  similar gift.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Every empirical law has the disquieting quality that one does not know
- |
  its limitations. We have seen that there are regularities in the events
- |
  in the world around us which can be formulated in terms of mathematical
- |
  concepts with an uncanny accuracy. There are, on the other hand, aspects
- |
  of the world concerning which we do not believe in the existence of any
- |
  accurate regularities. We call these initial conditions. The question
- |
  which presents itself is whether the different regularities, that is,
- |
  the various laws of nature which will be discovered, will fuse into a
- |
  single consistent unit, or at least asymptotically approach such a
- |
  fusion. Alternatively, it is possible that there always will be some
- |
  laws of nature which have nothing in common with each other. At present,
- |
  this is true, for instance, of the laws of heredity and of physics. It
- |
  is even possible that some of the laws of nature will be in conflict
- |
  with each other in their implications, but each convincing enough in its
- |
  own domain so that we may not be willing to abandon any of them. We may
- |
  resign ourselves to such a state of affairs or our interest in clearing
- |
  up the conflict between the various theories may fade out. We may lose
- |
  interest in the "ultimate truth," that is, in a picture which is a
- |
  consistent fusion into a single unit of the little pictures, formed on
- |
  the various aspects of nature.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It may be useful to illustrate the alternatives by an example. We now
- |
  have, in physics, two theories of great power and interest: the theory
- |
  of quantum phenomena and the theory of relativity. These two theories
- |
  have their roots in mutually exclusive groups of phenomena. Relativity
- |
  theory applies to macroscopic bodies, such as stars. The event of
- |
  coincidence, that is, in ultimate analysis of collision, is the
- |
  primitive event in the theory of relativity and defines a point in
- |
  space-time, or at least would define a point if the colliding panicles
- |
  were infinitely small. Quantum theory has its roots in the microscopic
- |
  world and, from its point of view, the event of coincidence, or of
- |
  collision, even if it takes place between particles of no spatial
- |
  extent, is not primitive and not at all sharply isolated in space-time.
- |
  The two theories operate with different mathematical conceptsãthe four
- |
  dimensional Riemann space and the infinite dimensional Hilbert space,
- |
  respectively. So far, the two theories could not be united, that is, no
- |
  mathematical formulation exists to which both of these theories are
- |
  approximations. All physicists believe that a union of the two theories
- |
  is inherently possible and that we shall find it. Nevertheless, it is
- |
  possible also to imagine that no union of the two theories can be found.
- |
  This example illustrates the two possibilities, of union and of
- |
  conflict, mentioned before, both of which are conceivable.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  In order to obtain an indication as to which alternative to expect
- |
  ultimately, we can pretend to be a little more ignorant than we are and
- |
  place ourselves at a lower level of knowledge than we actually possess.
- |
  If we can find a fusion of our theories on this lower level of
- |
  intelligence, we can confidently expect that we will find a fusion of
- |
  our theories also at our real level of intelligence. On the other hand,
- |
  if we would arrive at mutually contradictory theories at a somewhat
- |
  lower level of knowledge, the possibility of the permanence of
- |
  conflicting theories cannot be excluded for ourselves either. The level
- |
  of knowledge and ingenuity is a continuous variable and it is unlikely
- |
  that a relatively small variation of this continuous variable changes
- |
  the attainable picture of the world from inconsistent to consistent.
- |
  [10 This passage was written after a great deal of hesitation. The writer
- |
  is convinced that it is useful, in epistemological discussions, to
- |
  abandon the idealization that the level of human intelligence has a
- |
  singular position on an absolute scale. In some cases it may even be
- |
  useful to consider the attainment which is possible at the level of the
- |
  intelligence of some other species. However, the writer also realizes
- |
  that his thinking along the lines indicated in the text was too brief
- |
  and not subject to sufficient critical appraisal to be reliable.]
- |2+

- |
  Considered from this point of view, the fact that some of the theories
- |
  which we know to be false give such amazingly accurate results is an
- |
  adverse factor. Had we somewhat less knowledge, the group of phenomena
- |
  which these "false" theories explain would appear to us to be large
- |
  enough to "prove" these theories. However, these theories are considered
- |
  to be "false" by us just for the reason that they are, in ultimate
- |
  analysis, incompatible with more encompassing pictures and, if
- |
  sufficiently many such false theories are discovered, they are bound to
- |
  prove also to be in conflict with each other. Similarly, it is possible
- |
  that the theories, which we consider to be "proved" by a number of
- |
  numerical agreements which appears to be large enough for us, are false
- |
  because they are in conflict with a possible more encompassing theory
- |
  which is beyond our means of discovery. If this were true, we would have
- |
  to expect conflicts between our theories as soon as their number grows
- |
  beyond a certain point and as soon as they cover a sufficiently large
- |
  number of groups of phenomena. In contrast to the article of faith of
- |
  the theoretical physicist mentioned before, this is the nightmare of the
- |
  theorist.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Let us consider a few examples of "false" theories which give, in view
- |
  of their falseness, alarmingly accurate descriptions of groups of
- |
  phenomena. With some goodwill, one can dismiss some of the evidence
- |
  which these examples provide. The success of Bohr's early and pioneering
- |
  ideas on the atom was always a rather narrow one and the same applies to
- |
  Ptolemy's epicycles. Our present vantage point gives an accurate
- |
  description of all phenomena which these more primitive theories can
- |
  describe. The same is not true any longer of the so-called free-electron
- |
  theory, which gives a marvelously accurate picture of many, if not most,
- |
  properties of metals, semiconductors, and insulators. In particular, it
- |
  explains the fact, never properly understood on the basis of the "real
- |
  theory," that insulators show a specific resistance to electricity which
- |
  may be 1026 times greater than that of metals. In fact, there is no
- |
  experimental evidence to show that the resistance is not infinite under
- |
  the conditions under which the free-electron theory would lead us to
- |
  expect an infinite resistance. Nevertheless, we are convinced that the
- |
  free-electron theory is a crude approximation which should be replaced,
- |
  in the description of all phenomena concerning solids, by a more
- |
  accurate picture.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  If viewed from our real vantage point, the situation presented by the
- |
  free-electron theory is irritating but is not likely to forebode any
- |
  inconsistencies which are unsurmountable for us. The free-electron
- |
  theory raises doubts as to how much we should trust numerical agreement
- |
  between theory and experiment as evidence for the correctness of the
- |
  theory. We are used to such doubts.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  A much more difficult and confusing situation would arise if we could,
- |
  some day, establish a theory of the phenomena of consciousness, or of
- |
  biology, which would be as coherent and convincing as our present
- |
  theories of the inanimate world. Mendel's laws of inheritance and the
- |
  subsequent work on genes may well form the beginning of such a theory as
- |
  far as biology is concerned. Furthermore,, it is quite possible that an
- |
  abstract argument can be found which shows that there is a conflict
- |
  between such a theory and the accepted principles of physics. The
- |
  argument could be of such abstract nature that it might not be possible
- |
  to resolve the conflict, in favor of one or of the other theory, by an
- |
  experiment. Such a situation would put a heavy strain on our faith in
- |
  our theories and on our belief in the reality of the concepts which we
- |
  form. It would give us a deep sense of frustration in our search for
- |
  what I called "the ultimate truth." The reason that such a situation is
- |
  conceivable is that, fundamentally, we do not know why our theories work
- |
  so well. Hence, their accuracy may not prove their truth and
- |
  consistency. Indeed, it is this writer's belief that something rather
- |
  akin to the situation which was described above exists if the present
- |
  laws of heredity and of physics are confronted.
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |
  Let me end on a more cheerful note. The miracle of the appropriateness
- |
  of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of
- |
  physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. We
- |
  should be grateful for it and hope that it will remain valid in future
- |
  research and that it will extend, for better or for worse, to our
- |
  pleasure, even though perhaps also to our bafflement, to wide branches
- |
  of learning.

  Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme
- |
  beautya beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal
- |
  to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of
- |
  painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection
- |
  such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the

  exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of

  the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in

  poetry.

- |2+

- |
  THERE IS A story about two friends, who were classmates in high school,
- |
  talking about their jobs. One of them became a statistician and was
- |
  working on population trends. He showed a reprint to his former
- |
  classmate. The reprint started, as usual, with the Gaussian distribution
- |
  and the statistician explained to his former classmate the meaning of
- |
  the symbols for the actual population, for the average population, and
- |
  so on. His classmate was a bit incredulous and was not quite sure
- |
  whether the statistician was pulling his leg. "How can you know that?"
- |
  was his query. "And what is this symbol here?" "Oh," said the
- |
  statistician, "this is pi." "What is that?" "The ratio of the
- |
  circumference of the circle to its diameter." "Well, now you are pushing
- |
  your joke too far," said the classmate, "surely the population has
- |
  nothing to do with the circumference of the circle."
- |2+

- |
  Naturally, we are inclined to smile about the simplicity of the
- |
  classmate's approach. Nevertheless, when I heard this story, I had to
- |
  admit to an eerie feeling because, surely, the reaction of the classmate
- |
  betrayed only plain common sense. I was even more confused when, not
- |
  many days later, someone came to me and expressed his bewilderment
- |
  The preceding two stories illustrate the two main points which are the
- |
  subjects of the present discourse. The first point is that mathematical
- |
  concepts turn up in entirely unexpected connections. Moreover, they
- |
  often permit an unexpectedly close and accurate description of the
- |
  phenomena in these connections. Secondly, just because of this
- |
  circumstance, and because we do not understand the reasons of their
- |
  usefulness, we cannot know whether a theory formulated in terms of
- |
  mathematical concepts is uniquely appropriate. We are in a position
- |
  similar to that of a man who was provided with a bunch of keys and who,
- |
  having to open several doors in succession, always hit on the right key
- |
  on the first or second trial. He became skeptical concerning the
- |
  uniqueness of the coordination between keys and doors.
- |2+

- |
  Most of what will be said on these questions will not be new; it has
- |
  probably occurred to most scientists in one form or another. My
- |
  principal aim is to illuminate it from several sides. The first point is
- |
  that the enormous usefulness of mathematics in the natural sciences is
- |
  something bordering on the mysterious and that there is no rational
- |
  explanation for it. Second, it is just this uncanny usefulness of
- |
  mathematical concepts that raises the question of the uniqueness of our
- |
  physical theories. In order to establish the first point, that
- |
  mathematics plays an unreasonably important role in physics, it will be
- |
  useful to say a few words on the question, "What is mathematics?", then,
- |
  "What is physics?", then, how mathematics enters physical theories, and
- |
  last, why the success of mathematics in its role in physics appears so
- |
  baffling. Much less will be said on the second point: the uniqueness of
- |
  the theories of physics. A proper answer to this question would require
- |
  elaborate experimental and theoretical work which has not been
- |
  undertaken to date.
- |2+

- |
  WHAT IS MATHEMATICS?
- |2+

- |
  Somebody once said that philosophy is the misuse of a terminology which
- |
  was invented just for this purpose.
- |
  The complex numbers provide a particularly striking example for the
- |
  foregoing. Certainly, nothing in our experience suggests the
- |
  introduction of these quantities. Indeed, if a mathematician is asked to
- |
  justify his interest in complex numbers, he will point, with some
- |
  indignation, to the many beautiful theorems in the theory of equations,
- |
  of power series, and of analytic functions in general, which owe their
- |
  origin to the introduction of complex numbers. The mathematician is not
- |
  willing to give up his interest in these most beautiful accomplishments
- "of his genius. \n"
- |
  [4 The reader may be interested, in this connection, in Hilbert's rather
- |
  testy remarks about intuitionism which "seeks to break up and to
- |
  disfigure mathematics," Abh. Math. Sem., Univ. Hamburg, 157 (1922), or
- |
  Gesammelte Werke (Berlin: Springer, 1935), p. 188.]
- |2+

- |
  WHAT IS PHYSICS?
- |2+

- |
  The physicist is interested in discovering the laws of inanimate nature.
- |
  In order to understand this statement, it is necessary to analyze the
- |
  concept, "law of nature."
- |2+

- |
  The world around us is of baffling complexity and the most obvious fact
- |
  about it is that we cannot predict the future. Although the joke
- |
  attributes only to the optimist the view that the future is uncertain,
- |
  the optimist is right in this case: the future is unpredictable. It is,
- |
  as Schrodinger has remarked, a miracle that in spite of the baffling
- |
  complexity of the world, certain regularities in the events could be
- |
  discovered. One such regularity, discovered by Galileo, is that two
- |
  rocks, dropped at the same time from the same height, reach the ground
- |
  at the same time. The laws of nature are concerned with such
- |
  regularities. Galileo's regularity is a prototype of a large class of
- |
  regularities. It is a surprising regularity for three reasons.
- |2+

- |
  The first reason that it is surprising is that it is true not only in
- |
  Pisa, and in Galileo's time, it is true everywhere on the Earth, was
- |
  always true, and will always be true. This property of the regularity is
- |
  a recognized invariance property and, as I had occasion to point out
- |
  some time ago, without invariance principles similar to those implied in
- |
  the preceding generalization of Galileo's observation, physics would not
- |
  be possible. The second surprising feature is that the regularity which
- |
  we are discussing is independent of so many conditions which could have
- |
  an effect on it. It is valid no matter whether it rains or not, whether
- |
  the experiment is carried out in a room or from the Leaning Tower, no
- |
  matter whether the person who drops the rocks is a man or a woman. It is
- |
  valid even if the two rocks are dropped, simultaneously and from the
- |
  same height, by two different people. There are, obviously, innumerable
- |
  other conditions which are all immaterial from the point of view of the
- |
  validity of Galileo's regularity. The irrelevancy of so many
- |
  circumstances which could play a role in the phenomenon observed has
- |
  also been called an invariance. However, this invariance is of a
- |
  different character from the preceding one since it cannot be formulated
- |
  as a general principle. The exploration of the conditions which do, and
- |
  which do not, influence a phenomenon is part of the early experimental
- |
  exploration of a field. It is the skill and ingenuity of the
- |
  experimenter which show him phenomena which depend on a relatively
- |
  narrow set of relatively easily realizable and reproducible conditions.
- |
  The preceding two points, though highly significant from the point of
- |
  view of the philosopher, are not the ones which surprised Galileo most,
- |
  nor do they contain a specific law of nature. The law of nature is
- |
  contained in the statement that the length of time which it takes for a
- |
  heavy object to fall from a given height is independent of the size,
- |
  material, and shape of the body which drops. In the framework of
- |
  Newton's second "law," this amounts to the statement that the
- |
  gravitational force which acts on the falling body is proportional to
- |
  its mass but independent of the size, material, and shape of the body
- |
  which falls.
- |2+

- |
  The preceding discussion is intended to remind us, first, that it is not
- |
  at all natural that "laws of nature" exist, much less that man is able
- |
  to discover them.
- |
  As regards the present state of the world, such as the existence of the
- |
  earth on which we live and on which Galileo's experiments were
- |
  performed, the existence of the sun and of all our surroundings, the
- |
  laws of nature are entirely silent. It is in consonance with this,
- |
  first, that the laws of nature can be used to predict future events only
- |
  under exceptional circumstancesãwhen all the relevant determinants of
- |
  the present state of the world are known. It is also in consonance with
- |
  this that the construction of machines, the functioning of which he can
- |
  foresee, constitutes the most spectacular accomplishment of the
- |
  physicist. In these machines, the physicist creates a situation in which
- |
  all the relevant coordinates are known so that the behavior of the
- |
  machine can be predicted. Radars and nuclear reactors are examples of
- |
  such machines.
- |2+

- |
  The principal purpose of the preceding discussion is to point out that
- |
  the laws of nature are all conditional statements and they relate only
- |
  to a very small part of our knowledge of the world. Thus, classical
- |
  mechanics, which is the best known prototype of a physical theory, gives
- |
  the second derivatives of the positional coordinates of all bodies, on
- |
  the basis of the knowledge of the positions, etc., of these bodies. It
- |
  gives no information on the existence, the present positions, or
- |
  velocities of these bodies. It should be mentioned, for the sake of
- |
  accuracy, that we discovered about thirty years ago that even the
- |
  conditional statements cannot be entirely precise: that the conditional
- |
  statements are probability laws which enable us only to place
- |
  intelligent bets on future properties of the inanimate world, based on
- |
  the knowledge of the present state. They do not allow us to make
- |
  categorical statements, not even categorical statements conditional on
- |
  the present state of the world. The probabilistic nature of the "laws of
- |
  nature" manifests itself in the case of machines also, and can be
- |
  verified, at least in the case of nuclear reactors, if one runs them at
- |
  very low power. However, the additional limitation of the scope of the
- |
  laws of nature which follows from their probabilistic nature will play
- |
  no role in the rest of the discussion.

- "THE ROLE OF MATHEMATICS IN PHYSICAL THEORIES \n"
- |2+

- |
  Having refreshed our minds as to the essence of mathematics and physics,
- |
  we should be in a better position to review the role of mathematics in
- |
  physical theories.
- |2+

- |
  Naturally, we do use mathematics in everyday physics to evaluate the
- |
  results of the laws of nature, to apply the conditional statements to
- |
  the particular conditions which happen to prevail or happen to interest
- |
  us. In order that this be possible, the laws of nature must already be
- |
  formulated in mathematical language. However, the role of evaluating the
- |
  consequences of already established theories is not the most important
- |
  role of mathematics in physics. Mathematics, or, rather, applied
- |
  mathematics, is not so much the master of the situation in this
- |
  function: it is merely serving as a tool.
- |2+

- |
  Mathematics does play, however, also a more sovereign role in physics.
- |
  This was already implied in the statement, made when discussing the role
- |
  of applied mathematics, that the laws of nature must have been
- |
  formulated in the language of mathematics to be an object for the use of
- |
  applied mathematics. The statement that the laws of nature are written
- |
  in the language of mathematics was properly made three hundred years
- |
  ago;[8 It is attributed to Galileo]
- |2
   it is now more true than ever before. In order to show the
- |
  importance which mathematical concepts possess in the formulation of the
- |
  laws of physics, let us recall, as an example, the axioms of quantum
- |
  mechanics as formulated, explicitly, by the great physicist, Dirac.
- |
  There are two basic concepts in quantum mechanics: states and
- |
  observables. The states are vectors in Hilbert space, the observables
- |
  self-adjoint operators on these vectors. The possible values of the
- |
  observations are the characteristic values of the operatorsãbut we had
- |
  better stop here lest we engage in a listing of the mathematical
- |
  concepts developed in the theory of linear operators.
- |2+

- |
  It is true, of course, that physics chooses certain mathematical
- |
  concepts for the formulation of the laws of nature, and surely only a
- |
  fraction of all mathematical concepts is used in physics. It is true
- |
  also that the concepts which were chosen were not selected arbitrarily
- |
  from a listing of mathematical terms but were developed, in many if not
- |
  most cases, independently by the physicist and recognized then as having
- |
  been conceived before by the mathematician. It is not true, however, as
- |
  is so often stated, that this had to happen because mathematics uses the
- |
  simplest possible concepts and these were bound to occur in any
- |
  formalism. As we saw before, the concepts of mathematics are not chosen
- |
  for their conceptual simplicityeven sequences of pairs of numbers are
- |
  far from being the simplest conceptsbut for their amenability to clever
- |
  manipulations and to striking, brilliant arguments. Let us not forget
- |
  that the Hilbert space of quantum mechanics is the complex Hilbert
- |
  space, with a Hermitean scalar product. Surely to the unpreoccupied
- |
  mind, complex numbers are far from natural or simple and they cannot be
- |
  suggested by physical observations. Furthermore, the use of complex
- |
  numbers is in this case not a calculational trick of applied mathematics
- |
  but comes close to being a necessity in the formulation of the laws of
- |
  quantum mechanics. Finally, it now begins to appear that not only
- |
  complex numbers but so-called analytic functions are destined to play a
- |
  decisive role in the formulation of quantum theory. I am referring to
- |
  the rapidly developing theory of dispersion relations.
- |2+

- |
  It is difficult to avoid the impression that a miracle confronts us
- |
  here, quite comparable in its striking nature to the miracle that the
- |
  human mind can string a thousand arguments together without getting
- |
  itself into contradictions, or to the two miracles of the existence of
- |
  laws of nature and of the human mind's capacity to divine them. The
- |
  observation which comes closest to an explanation for the mathematical
- |
  concepts' cropping up in physics which I know is Einstein's statement
- |
  that the only physical theories which we are willing to accept are the
- |
  beautiful ones. It stands to argue that the concepts of mathematics,
- |
  which invite the exercise of so much wit, have the quality of beauty.
- |
  However, Einstein's observation can at best explain properties of
- |
  theories which we are willing to believe and has no reference to the
- |
  intrinsic accuracy of the theory. We shall, therefore, turn to this
- |
  latter question.
- |2+

- |
  IS THE SUCCESS OF PHYSICAL THEORIES TRULY SURPRISING?
- |2+

- |
  A possible explanation of the physicist's use of mathematics to
- |
  formulate his laws of nature is that he is a somewhat irresponsible
- |
  person. As a result, when he finds a connection between two quantities
- |
  which resembles a connection well-known from mathematics, he will jump
- |
  at the conclusion that the connection is that discussed in mathematics
- |
  simply because he does not know of any other similar connection. It is
- |
  not the intention of the present discussion to refute the charge that
- |
  the physicist is a somewhat irresponsible person. Perhaps he is.
- |
  However, it is important to point out that the mathematical formulation
- |
  of the physicist's often crude experience leads in an uncanny number of
- |
  cases to an amazingly accurate description of a large class of
- |
  phenomena. This shows that the mathematical language has more to commend
- |
  it than being the only language which we can speak; it shows that it is,
- |
  in a very real sense, the correct language. Let us consider a few
- |
  examples.
- |2+

- |
  The first example is the oft-quoted one of planetary motion. The laws of
- |
  falling bodies became rather well established as a result of experiments
- |
  carried out principally in Italy. These experiments could not be very
- |
  accurate in the sense in which we understand accuracy today partly
- |
  because of the effect of air resistance and partly because of the
- |
  impossibility, at that time, to measure short time intervals.
- |
  Nevertheless, it is not surprising that, as a result of their studies,
- |
  the Italian natural scientists acquired a familiarity with the ways in
- |
  which objects travel through the atmosphere. It was Newton who then
- |
  brought the law of freely falling objects into relation with the motion
- |
  of the moon, noted that the parabola of the thrown rock's path on the
- |
  earth and the circle of the moon's path in the sky are particular cases
- |
  of the same mathematical object of an ellipse, and postulated the
- |
  universal law of gravitation on the basis of a single, and at that time
- |
  very approximate, numerical coincidence. Philosophically, the law of
- |
  gravitation as formulated by Newton was repugnant to his time and to
- |
  himself. Empirically, it was based on very scanty observations. The
- |
  mathematical language in which it was formulated contained the concept
- |
  of a second derivative and those of us who have tried to draw an
- |
  osculating circle to a curve know that the second derivative is not a
- |
  very immediate concept. The law of gravity which Newton reluctantly
- |
  established and which he could verify with an accuracy of about 4% has
- |
  proved to be accurate to less than a ten thousandth of a per cent and
- |
  became so closely associated with the idea of absolute accuracy that
- |
  only recently did physicists become again bold enough to inquire into
- |
  the limitations of its accuracy.
- |
  [9 See, for instance, R. H. Dicke, Am. Sci., 25 (1959).]
- |
  Certainly, the example of Newton's
- |
  law, quoted over and over again, must be mentioned first as a monumental
- |
  example of a law, formulated in terms which appear simple to the
- |
  mathematician, which has proved accurate beyond all reasonable
- |
  expectations. Let us just recapitulate our thesis on this example:
- |
  first, the law, particularly since a second derivative appears in it, is
- |
  simple only to the mathematician, not to common sense or to
- |
  non-mathematically-minded freshmen; second, it is a conditional law of
- |
  very limited scope. It explains nothing about the earth which attracts
- |
  Galileo's rocks, or about the circular form of the moon's orbit, or
- |
  about the planets of the sun. The explanation of these initial
- |
  conditions is left to the geologist and the astronomer, and they have a
- |
  hard time with them.
- |2+

- |
  The second example is that of ordinary, elementary quantum mechanics.
- |
  This originated when Max Born noticed that some rules of computation,
- |
  given by Heisenberg, were formally identical with the rules of
- |
  computation with matrices, established a long time before by
- |
  mathematicians. Born, Jordan, and Heisenberg then proposed to replace by
- |
  matrices the position and momentum variables of the equations of
- |
  classical mechanics. They applied the rules of matrix mechanics to a few
- |
  highly idealized problems and the results were quite satisfactory.
- |
  However, there was, at that time, no rational evidence that their matrix
- |
  mechanics would prove correct under more realistic conditions. Indeed,
- |
  they say "if the mechanics as here proposed should already be correct in
- |
  its essential traits." As a matter of fact, the first application of
- |
  their mechanics to a realistic problem, that of the hydrogen atom, was
- |
  given several months later, by Pauli. This application gave results in
- |
  agreement with experience. This was satisfactory but still
- |
  understandable because Heisenberg's rules of calculation were abstracted
- |
  from problems which included the old theory of the hydrogen atom. The
- |
  miracle occurred only when matrix mechanics, or a mathematically
- |
  equivalent theory, was applied to problems for which Heisenberg's
- |
  calculating rules were meaningless. Heisenberg's rules presupposed that
- |
  the classical equations of motion had solutions with certain periodicity
- |
  properties; and the equations of motion of the two electrons of the
- |
  helium atom, or of the even greater number of electrons of heavier
- |
  atoms, simply do not have these properties, so that Heisenberg's rules
- |
  cannot be applied to these cases. Nevertheless, the calculation of the
- |
  lowest energy level of helium, as carried out a few months ago by
- |
  Kinoshita at Cornell and by Bazley at the Bureau of Standards, agrees
- |
  with the experimental data within the accuracy of the observations,
- |
  which is one part in ten million. Surely in this case we "got something
- |
  out" of the equations that we did not put in.
- |2+

- |
  The same is true of the qualitative characteristics of the "complex
- |
  spectra," that is, the spectra of heavier atoms. I wish to recall a
- |
  conversation with Jordan, who told me, when the qualitative features of
- |
  the spectra were derived, that a disagreement of the rules derived from
- |
  quantum mechanical theory and the rules established by empirical
- |
  research would have provided the last opportunity to make a change in
- |
  the framework of matrix mechanics. In other words, Jordan felt that we
- |
  would have been, at least temporarily, helpless had an unexpected
- |
  disagreement occurred in the theory of the helium atom. This was, at
- |
  that time, developed by Kellner and by Hilleraas. The mathematical
- |
  formalism was too dear and unchangeable so that, had the miracle of
- |
  helium which was mentioned before not occurred, a true crisis would have
- |
  arisen. Surely, physics would have overcome that crisis in one way or
- |
  another. It is true, on the other hand, that physics as we know it today
- |
  would not be possible without a constant recurrence of miracles similar
- |
  to the one of the helium atom, which is perhaps the most striking
- |
  miracle that has occurred in the course of the development of elementary
- |
  quantum mechanics, but by far not the only one. In fact, the number of
- |
  analogous miracles is limited, in our view, only by our willingness to
- |
  go after more similar ones. Quantum mechanics had, nevertheless, many
- |
  almost equally striking successes which gave us the firm conviction that
- |
  it is, what we call, correct.
- |2+

- |
  The last example is that of quantum electrodynamics, or the theory of
- |
  the Lamb shift. Whereas Newton's theory of gravitation still had obvious
- |
  connections with experience, experience entered the formulation of
- |
  matrix mechanics only in the refined or sublimated form of Heisenberg's
- |
  prescriptions. The quantum theory of the Lamb shift, as conceived by
- |
  Bethe and established by Schwinger, is a purely mathematical theory and
- |
  the only direct contribution of experiment was to show the existence of
- |
  a measurable effect. The agreement with calculation is better than one
- |
  part in a thousand.
- |2+

- |
  The preceding three examples, which could be multiplied almost
- |
  indefinitely, should illustrate the appropriateness and accuracy of the
- |
  mathematical formulation of the laws of nature in terms of concepts
- |
  chosen for their manipulability, the "laws of nature" being of almost
- |
  fantastic accuracy but of strictly limited scope. I propose to refer to
- |
  the observation which these examples illustrate as the empirical law of
- |
  epistemology. Together with the laws of invariance of physical theories,
- |
  it is an indispensable foundation of these theories. Without the laws of
- |
  invariance the physical theories could have been given no foundation of
- |
  fact; if the empirical law of epistemology were not correct, we would
- |
  lack the encouragement and reassurance which are emotional necessities,
- |
  without which the "laws of nature" could not have been successfully
- |
  explored. Dr. R. G. Sachs, with whom I discussed the empirical law of
- |
  epistemology, called it an article of faith of the theoretical
- |
  physicist, and it is surely that. However, what he called our article of
- |
  faith can be well supported by actual examplesãmany examples in addition
- |
  to the three which have been mentioned.
- |2+

- "THE UNIQUENESS OF THE THEORIES OF PHYSICS \n"
- |2+

- |
  The empirical nature of the preceding observation seems to me to be
- |
  self-evident. It surely is not a "necessity of thought" and it should
- |
  not be necessary, in order to prove this, to point to the fact that it
- |
  applies only to a very small part of our knowledge of the inanimate
- |
  world. It is absurd to believe that the existence of mathematically
- |
  simple expressions for the second derivative of the position is
- |
  self-evident, when no similar expressions for the position itself or for
- |
  the velocity exist. It is therefore surprising how readily the wonderful
- |
  gift contained in the empirical law of epistemology was taken for
- |
  granted. The ability of the human mind to form a string of 1000
- |
  conclusions and still remain "right," which was mentioned before, is a
- |
  similar gift.
- |2+

- |
  Every empirical law has the disquieting quality that one does not know
- |
  its limitations. We have seen that there are regularities in the events
- |
  in the world around us which can be formulated in terms of mathematical
- |
  concepts with an uncanny accuracy. There are, on the other hand, aspects
- |
  of the world concerning which we do not believe in the existence of any
- |
  accurate regularities. We call these initial conditions. The question
- |
  which presents itself is whether the different regularities, that is,
- |
  the various laws of nature which will be discovered, will fuse into a
- |
  single consistent unit, or at least asymptotically approach such a
- |
  fusion. Alternatively, it is possible that there always will be some
- |
  laws of nature which have nothing in common with each other. At present,
- |
  this is true, for instance, of the laws of heredity and of physics. It
- |
  is even possible that some of the laws of nature will be in conflict
- |
  with each other in their implications, but each convincing enough in its
- |
  own domain so that we may not be willing to abandon any of them. We may
- |
  resign ourselves to such a state of affairs or our interest in clearing
- |
  up the conflict between the various theories may fade out. We may lose
- |
  interest in the "ultimate truth," that is, in a picture which is a
- |
  consistent fusion into a single unit of the little pictures, formed on
- |
  the various aspects of nature.
- |2+

- |
  It may be useful to illustrate the alternatives by an example. We now
- |
  have, in physics, two theories of great power and interest: the theory
- |
  of quantum phenomena and the theory of relativity. These two theories
- |
  have their roots in mutually exclusive groups of phenomena. Relativity
- |
  theory applies to macroscopic bodies, such as stars. The event of
- |
  coincidence, that is, in ultimate analysis of collision, is the
- |
  primitive event in the theory of relativity and defines a point in
- |
  space-time, or at least would define a point if the colliding panicles
- |
  were infinitely small. Quantum theory has its roots in the microscopic
- |
  world and, from its point of view, the event of coincidence, or of
- |
  collision, even if it takes place between particles of no spatial
- |
  extent, is not primitive and not at all sharply isolated in space-time.
- |
  The two theories operate with different mathematical conceptsãthe four
- |
  dimensional Riemann space and the infinite dimensional Hilbert space,
- |
  respectively. So far, the two theories could not be united, that is, no
- |
  mathematical formulation exists to which both of these theories are
- |
  approximations. All physicists believe that a union of the two theories
- |
  is inherently possible and that we shall find it. Nevertheless, it is
- |
  possible also to imagine that no union of the two theories can be found.
- |
  This example illustrates the two possibilities, of union and of
- |
  conflict, mentioned before, both of which are conceivable.
- |2+

- |
  In order to obtain an indication as to which alternative to expect
- |
  ultimately, we can pretend to be a little more ignorant than we are and
- |
  place ourselves at a lower level of knowledge than we actually possess.
- |
  If we can find a fusion of our theories on this lower level of
- |
  intelligence, we can confidently expect that we will find a fusion of
- |
  our theories also at our real level of intelligence. On the other hand,
- |
  if we would arrive at mutually contradictory theories at a somewhat
- |
  lower level of knowledge, the possibility of the permanence of
- |
  conflicting theories cannot be excluded for ourselves either. The level
- |
  of knowledge and ingenuity is a continuous variable and it is unlikely
- |
  that a relatively small variation of this continuous variable changes
- |
  the attainable picture of the world from inconsistent to consistent.
- |
  [10 This passage was written after a great deal of hesitation. The writer
- |
  is convinced that it is useful, in epistemological discussions, to
- |
  abandon the idealization that the level of human intelligence has a
- |
  singular position on an absolute scale. In some cases it may even be
- |
  useful to consider the attainment which is possible at the level of the
- |
  intelligence of some other species. However, the writer also realizes
- |
  that his thinking along the lines indicated in the text was too brief
- |
  and not subject to sufficient critical appraisal to be reliable.]
- |2+

- |
  Considered from this point of view, the fact that some of the theories
- |
  which we know to be false give such amazingly accurate results is an
- |
  adverse factor. Had we somewhat less knowledge, the group of phenomena
- |
  which these "false" theories explain would appear to us to be large
- |
  enough to "prove" these theories. However, these theories are considered
- |
  to be "false" by us just for the reason that they are, in ultimate
- |
  analysis, incompatible with more encompassing pictures and, if
- |
  sufficiently many such false theories are discovered, they are bound to
- |
  prove also to be in conflict with each other. Similarly, it is possible
- |
  that the theories, which we consider to be "proved" by a number of
- |
  numerical agreements which appears to be large enough for us, are false
- |
  because they are in conflict with a possible more encompassing theory
- |
  which is beyond our means of discovery. If this were true, we would have
- |
  to expect conflicts between our theories as soon as their number grows
- |
  beyond a certain point and as soon as they cover a sufficiently large
- |
  number of groups of phenomena. In contrast to the article of faith of
- |
  the theoretical physicist mentioned before, this is the nightmare of the
- |
  theorist.
- |2+

- |
  Let us consider a few examples of "false" theories which give, in view
- |
  of their falseness, alarmingly accurate descriptions of groups of
- |
  phenomena. With some goodwill, one can dismiss some of the evidence
- |
  which these examples provide. The success of Bohr's early and pioneering
- |
  ideas on the atom was always a rather narrow one and the same applies to
- |
  Ptolemy's epicycles. Our present vantage point gives an accurate
- |
  description of all phenomena which these more primitive theories can
- |
  describe. The same is not true any longer of the so-called free-electron
- |
  theory, which gives a marvelously accurate picture of many, if not most,
- |
  properties of metals, semiconductors, and insulators. In particular, it
- |
  explains the fact, never properly understood on the basis of the "real
- |
  theory," that insulators show a specific resistance to electricity which
- |
  may be 1026 times greater than that of metals. In fact, there is no
- |
  experimental evidence to show that the resistance is not infinite under
- |
  the conditions under which the free-electron theory would lead us to
- |
  expect an infinite resistance. Nevertheless, we are convinced that the
- |
  free-electron theory is a crude approximation which should be replaced,
- |
  in the description of all phenomena concerning solids, by a more
- |
  accurate picture.
- |2+

- |
  If viewed from our real vantage point, the situation presented by the
- |
  free-electron theory is irritating but is not likely to forebode any
- |
  inconsistencies which are unsurmountable for us. The free-electron
- |
  theory raises doubts as to how much we should trust numerical agreement
- |
  between theory and experiment as evidence for the correctness of the
- |
  theory. We are used to such doubts.
- |2+

- |
  A much more difficult and confusing situation would arise if we could,
- |
  some day, establish a theory of the phenomena of consciousness, or of
- |
  biology, which would be as coherent and convincing as our present
- |
  theories of the inanimate world. Mendel's laws of inheritance and the
- |
  subsequent work on genes may well form the beginning of such a theory as
- |
  far as biology is concerned. Furthermore,, it is quite possible that an
- |
  abstract argument can be found which shows that there is a conflict
- |
  between such a theory and the accepted principles of physics. The
- |
  argument could be of such abstract nature that it might not be possible
- |
  to resolve the conflict, in favor of one or of the other theory, by an
- |
  experiment. Such a situation would put a heavy strain on our faith in
- |
  our theories and on our belief in the reality of the concepts which we
- |
  form. It would give us a deep sense of frustration in our search for
- |
  what I called "the ultimate truth." The reason that such a situation is
- |
  conceivable is that, fundamentally, we do not know why our theories work
- |
  so well. Hence, their accuracy may not prove their truth and
- |
  consistency. Indeed, it is this writer's belief that something rather
- |
  akin to the situation which was described above exists if the present
- |
  laws of heredity and of physics are confronted.
- |2+

- |
  Let me end on a more cheerful note. The miracle of the appropriateness
- |
  of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of
- |
  physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. We
- |
  should be grateful for it and hope that it will remain valid in future
- |
  research and that it will extend, for better or for worse, to our
- |
  pleasure, even though perhaps also to our bafflement, to wide branches
- |
  of learning.

title: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences
links: []
rawText: "\n\n\n\nReading Materials\n\nThe Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics
  in the Natural Sciences\n\n\nby Eugene Wigner\n\n\n\n\"The Unreasonable Effectiveness
  of Mathematics in the\nNatural Sciences,\" in Communications in Pure and Applied
  Mathematics,\nvol. 13, No. I (February 1960). New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nCopyright
  © 1960 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n\n\n\n\nMathematics, rightly viewed, possesses
  not only truth, but supreme\nbeautya beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture,
  without appeal\nto any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings
  of\npainting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection\nsuch
  as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the\nexaltation,
  the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of\nthe highest excellence,
  is to be found in mathematics as surely as in\npoetry.\n\n\n\n                           --BERTRAND
  RUSSELL, Study of Mathematics \n\n\n\n\n\nTHERE IS A story about two friends, who
  were classmates in high school,\ntalking about their jobs. One of them became a
  statistician and was\nworking on population trends. He showed a reprint to his former\nclassmate.
  The reprint started, as usual, with the Gaussian distribution\nand the statistician
  explained to his former classmate the meaning of\nthe symbols for the actual population,
  for the average population, and\nso on. His classmate was a bit incredulous and
  was not quite sure\nwhether the statistician was pulling his leg. \"How can you
  know that?\"\nwas his query. \"And what is this symbol here?\" \"Oh,\" said the\nstatistician,
  \"this is pi.\" \"What is that?\" \"The ratio of the\ncircumference of the circle
  to its diameter.\" \"Well, now you are pushing\nyour joke too far,\" said the classmate,
  \"surely the population has\nnothing to do with the circumference of the circle.\"\n\n\n\nNaturally,
  we are inclined to smile about the simplicity of the\nclassmate's approach. Nevertheless,
  when I heard this story, I had to\nadmit to an eerie feeling because, surely, the
  reaction of the classmate\nbetrayed only plain common sense. I was even more confused
  when, not\nmany days later, someone came to me and expressed his bewilderment\n[1
  The remark to be quoted was made by F. Werner when he was a student in\nPrinceton.]
  \nwith the fact that we make a rather narrow selection when choosing the data\non
  which we test our theories. \"How do we know that, if we made a theory\nwhich focuses
  its attention on phenomena we disregard and disregards\nsome of the phenomena now
  commanding our attention, that we could not\nbuild another theory which has little
  in common with the present one but\nwhich, nevertheless, explains just as many phenomena
  as the present\ntheory?\" It has to be admitted that we have no definite evidence
  that\nthere is no such theory.\n\n\n\nThe preceding two stories illustrate the two
  main points which are the\nsubjects of the present discourse. The first point is
  that mathematical\nconcepts turn up in entirely unexpected connections. Moreover,
  they\noften permit an unexpectedly close and accurate description of the\nphenomena
  in these connections. Secondly, just because of this\ncircumstance, and because
  we do not understand the reasons of their\nusefulness, we cannot know whether a
  theory formulated in terms of\nmathematical concepts is uniquely appropriate. We
  are in a position\nsimilar to that of a man who was provided with a bunch of keys
  and who,\nhaving to open several doors in succession, always hit on the right key\non
  the first or second trial. He became skeptical concerning the\nuniqueness of the
  coordination between keys and doors.\n\n\n\nMost of what will be said on these questions
  will not be new; it has\nprobably occurred to most scientists in one form or another.
  My\nprincipal aim is to illuminate it from several sides. The first point is\nthat
  the enormous usefulness of mathematics in the natural sciences is\nsomething bordering
  on the mysterious and that there is no rational\nexplanation for it. Second, it
  is just this uncanny usefulness of\nmathematical concepts that raises the question
  of the uniqueness of our\nphysical theories. In order to establish the first point,
  that\nmathematics plays an unreasonably important role in physics, it will be\nuseful
  to say a few words on the question, \"What is mathematics?\", then,\n\"What is physics?\",
  then, how mathematics enters physical theories, and\nlast, why the success of mathematics
  in its role in physics appears so\nbaffling. Much less will be said on the second
  point: the uniqueness of\nthe theories of physics. A proper answer to this question
  would require\nelaborate experimental and theoretical work which has not been\nundertaken
  to date.\n\n\n\nWHAT IS MATHEMATICS?\n\n\n\nSomebody once said that philosophy is
  the misuse of a terminology which\nwas invented just for this purpose.\n[2 This
  statement is quoted here from W. Dubislav's Die Philosophie der\nMathematik in der
  Gegenwart (Berlin: Junker and Dunnhaupt Verlag, 1932),\np. 1.] In the same vein,
  I would say that\nmathematics is the science of skillful operations with concepts
  and\nrules invented just for this purpose. The principal emphasis is on the\ninvention
  of concepts. Mathematics would soon run out of interesting\ntheorems if these had
  to be formulated in terms of the concepts which\nalready appear in the axioms. Furthermore,
  whereas it is unquestionably\ntrue that the concepts of elementary mathematics and
  particularly\nelementary geometry were formulated to describe entities which are\ndirectly
  suggested by the actual world, the same does not seem to be\ntrue of the more advanced
  concepts, in particular the concepts which\nplay such an important role in physics.
  Thus, the rules for operations\nwith pairs of numbers are obviously designed to
  give the same results as\nthe operations with fractions which we first learned without
  reference\nto \"pairs of numbers.\" The rules for the operations with sequences,
  that\nis, with irrational numbers, still belong to the category of rules which\nwere
  determined so as to reproduce rules for the operations with\nquantities which were
  already known to us. Most more advanced\nmathematical concepts, such as complex
  numbers, algebras, linear\noperators, Borel setsãand this list could be continued
  almost\nindefinitelyãwere so devised that they are apt subjects on which the\nmathematician
  can demonstrate his ingenuity and sense of formal beauty.\nIn fact, the definition
  of these concepts, with a realization that\ninteresting and ingenious considerations
  could be applied to them, is\nthe first demonstration of the ingeniousness of the
  mathematician who\ndefines them. The depth of thought which goes into the formulation
  of\nthe mathematical concepts is later justified by the skill with which\nthese
  concepts are used. The great mathematician fully, almost\nruthlessly, exploits the
  domain of permissible reasoning and skirts the\nimpermissible. That his recklessness
  does not lead him into a morass of\ncontradictions is a miracle in itself: certainly
  it is hard to believe\nthat our reasoning power was brought, by Darwin's process
  of natural\nselection, to the perfection which it seems to possess. However, this
  is\nnot our present subject. The principal point which will have to be\nrecalled
  later is that the mathematician could formulate only a handful\nof interesting theorems
  without defining concepts beyond those contained\nin the axioms and that the concepts
  outside those contained in the\naxioms are defined with a view of permitting ingenious
  logical\noperations which appeal to our aesthetic sense both as operations and\nalso
  in their results of great generality and simplicity.\n[3 M. Polanyi, in his Personal
  Knowledge (Chicago: University of Chicago\nPress, 1958), says: \"All these difficulties
  are but consequences of our\nrefusal to see that mathematics cannot be defined without
  acknowledging\nits most obvious feature: namely, that it is interesting\" (p 188).]\n\n\n\nThe
  complex numbers provide a particularly striking example for the\nforegoing. Certainly,
  nothing in our experience suggests the\nintroduction of these quantities. Indeed,
  if a mathematician is asked to\njustify his interest in complex numbers, he will
  point, with some\nindignation, to the many beautiful theorems in the theory of equations,\nof
  power series, and of analytic functions in general, which owe their\norigin to the
  introduction of complex numbers. The mathematician is not\nwilling to give up his
  interest in these most beautiful accomplishments\nof his genius. \n[4 The reader
  may be interested, in this connection, in Hilbert's rather\ntesty remarks about
  intuitionism which \"seeks to break up and to\ndisfigure mathematics,\" Abh. Math.
  Sem., Univ. Hamburg, 157 (1922), or\nGesammelte Werke (Berlin: Springer, 1935),
  p. 188.]\n\n\n\nWHAT IS PHYSICS?\n\n\n\nThe physicist is interested in discovering
  the laws of inanimate nature.\nIn order to understand this statement, it is necessary
  to analyze the\nconcept, \"law of nature.\"\n\n\n\nThe world around us is of baffling
  complexity and the most obvious fact\nabout it is that we cannot predict the future.
  Although the joke\nattributes only to the optimist the view that the future is uncertain,\nthe
  optimist is right in this case: the future is unpredictable. It is,\nas Schrodinger
  has remarked, a miracle that in spite of the baffling\ncomplexity of the world,
  certain regularities in the events could be\ndiscovered. One such regularity, discovered
  by Galileo, is that two\nrocks, dropped at the same time from the same height, reach
  the ground\nat the same time. The laws of nature are concerned with such\nregularities.
  Galileo's regularity is a prototype of a large class of\nregularities. It is a surprising
  regularity for three reasons.\n\n\n\nThe first reason that it is surprising is that
  it is true not only in\nPisa, and in Galileo's time, it is true everywhere on the
  Earth, was\nalways true, and will always be true. This property of the regularity
  is\na recognized invariance property and, as I had occasion to point out\nsome time
  ago, without invariance principles similar to those implied in\nthe preceding generalization
  of Galileo's observation, physics would not\nbe possible. The second surprising
  feature is that the regularity which\nwe are discussing is independent of so many
  conditions which could have\nan effect on it. It is valid no matter whether it rains
  or not, whether\nthe experiment is carried out in a room or from the Leaning Tower,
  no\nmatter whether the person who drops the rocks is a man or a woman. It is\nvalid
  even if the two rocks are dropped, simultaneously and from the\nsame height, by
  two different people. There are, obviously, innumerable\nother conditions which
  are all immaterial from the point of view of the\nvalidity of Galileo's regularity.
  The irrelevancy of so many\ncircumstances which could play a role in the phenomenon
  observed has\nalso been called an invariance. However, this invariance is of a\ndifferent
  character from the preceding one since it cannot be formulated\nas a general principle.
  The exploration of the conditions which do, and\nwhich do not, influence a phenomenon
  is part of the early experimental\nexploration of a field. It is the skill and ingenuity
  of the\nexperimenter which show him phenomena which depend on a relatively\nnarrow
  set of relatively easily realizable and reproducible conditions.\n[5 See, in this
  connection, the graphic essay of M. Deutsch, Daedalus 87,\n86 (1958). A. Shimony
  has called my attention to a similar passage in C.\nS. Peirce's Essays in the Philosophy
  of Science (New York: The Liberal\nArts Press, 1957), p. 237.]\nIn the present case,
  Galileo's restriction of his observations to\nrelatively heavy bodies was the most
  important step in this regard.\nAgain, it is true that if there were no phenomena
  which are independent\nof all but a manageably small set of conditions, physics
  would be\nimpossible.\n\n\n\nThe preceding two points, though highly significant
  from the point of\nview of the philosopher, are not the ones which surprised Galileo
  most,\nnor do they contain a specific law of nature. The law of nature is\ncontained
  in the statement that the length of time which it takes for a\nheavy object to fall
  from a given height is independent of the size,\nmaterial, and shape of the body
  which drops. In the framework of\nNewton's second \"law,\" this amounts to the statement
  that the\ngravitational force which acts on the falling body is proportional to\nits
  mass but independent of the size, material, and shape of the body\nwhich falls.\n\n\n\nThe
  preceding discussion is intended to remind us, first, that it is not\nat all natural
  that \"laws of nature\" exist, much less that man is able\nto discover them. [6
  E. Schrodinger, in his What Is Life? (Cambridge: Cambridge University\nPress, 1945),
  p. 31, says that this second miracle may well be beyond\nhuman understanding.]\nThe
  present writer had occasion, some time ago, to\ncall attention to the succession
  of layers of \"laws of nature,\" each\nlayer containing more general and more encompassing
  laws than the\nprevious one and its discovery constituting a deeper penetration
  into\nthe structure of the universe than the layers recognized before.\nHowever,
  the point which is most significant in the present context is\nthat all these laws
  of nature contain, in even their remotest\nconsequences, only a small part of our
  knowledge of the inanimate world.\nAll the laws of nature are conditional statements
  which permit a\nprediction of some future events on the basis of the knowledge of
  the\npresent, except that some aspects of the present state of the world, in\npractice
  the overwhelming majority of the determinants of the present\nstate of the world,
  are irrelevant from the point of view of the\nprediction. The irrelevancy is meant
  in the sense of the second point in\nthe discussion of Galileo's theorem.\n[7 The
  writer feels sure that it is unnecessary to mention that Galileo's\ntheorem, as
  given in the text, does not exhaust the content of Galileo's\nobservations in connection
  with the laws of freely falling bodies.]\n\n\n\nAs regards the present state of
  the world, such as the existence of the\nearth on which we live and on which Galileo's
  experiments were\nperformed, the existence of the sun and of all our surroundings,
  the\nlaws of nature are entirely silent. It is in consonance with this,\nfirst,
  that the laws of nature can be used to predict future events only\nunder exceptional
  circumstancesãwhen all the relevant determinants of\nthe present state of the world
  are known. It is also in consonance with\nthis that the construction of machines,
  the functioning of which he can\nforesee, constitutes the most spectacular accomplishment
  of the\nphysicist. In these machines, the physicist creates a situation in which\nall
  the relevant coordinates are known so that the behavior of the\nmachine can be predicted.
  Radars and nuclear reactors are examples of\nsuch machines.\n\n\n\nThe principal
  purpose of the preceding discussion is to point out that\nthe laws of nature are
  all conditional statements and they relate only\nto a very small part of our knowledge
  of the world. Thus, classical\nmechanics, which is the best known prototype of a
  physical theory, gives\nthe second derivatives of the positional coordinates of
  all bodies, on\nthe basis of the knowledge of the positions, etc., of these bodies.
  It\ngives no information on the existence, the present positions, or\nvelocities
  of these bodies. It should be mentioned, for the sake of\naccuracy, that we discovered
  about thirty years ago that even the\nconditional statements cannot be entirely
  precise: that the conditional\nstatements are probability laws which enable us only
  to place\nintelligent bets on future properties of the inanimate world, based on\nthe
  knowledge of the present state. They do not allow us to make\ncategorical statements,
  not even categorical statements conditional on\nthe present state of the world.
  The probabilistic nature of the \"laws of\nnature\" manifests itself in the case
  of machines also, and can be\nverified, at least in the case of nuclear reactors,
  if one runs them at\nvery low power. However, the additional limitation of the scope
  of the\nlaws of nature which follows from their probabilistic nature will play\nno
  role in the rest of the discussion.\n\n\n\nTHE ROLE OF MATHEMATICS IN PHYSICAL THEORIES
  \n\n\n\nHaving refreshed our minds as to the essence of mathematics and physics,\nwe
  should be in a better position to review the role of mathematics in\nphysical theories.\n\n\n\nNaturally,
  we do use mathematics in everyday physics to evaluate the\nresults of the laws of
  nature, to apply the conditional statements to\nthe particular conditions which
  happen to prevail or happen to interest\nus. In order that this be possible, the
  laws of nature must already be\nformulated in mathematical language. However, the
  role of evaluating the\nconsequences of already established theories is not the
  most important\nrole of mathematics in physics. Mathematics, or, rather, applied\nmathematics,
  is not so much the master of the situation in this\nfunction: it is merely serving
  as a tool.\n\n\n\nMathematics does play, however, also a more sovereign role in
  physics.\nThis was already implied in the statement, made when discussing the role\nof
  applied mathematics, that the laws of nature must have been\nformulated in the language
  of mathematics to be an object for the use of\napplied mathematics. The statement
  that the laws of nature are written\nin the language of mathematics was properly
  made three hundred years\nago;[8 It is attributed to Galileo]\n it is now more true
  than ever before. In order to show the\nimportance which mathematical concepts possess
  in the formulation of the\nlaws of physics, let us recall, as an example, the axioms
  of quantum\nmechanics as formulated, explicitly, by the great physicist, Dirac.\nThere
  are two basic concepts in quantum mechanics: states and\nobservables. The states
  are vectors in Hilbert space, the observables\nself-adjoint operators on these vectors.
  The possible values of the\nobservations are the characteristic values of the operatorsãbut
  we had\nbetter stop here lest we engage in a listing of the mathematical\nconcepts
  developed in the theory of linear operators.\n\n\n\nIt is true, of course, that
  physics chooses certain mathematical\nconcepts for the formulation of the laws of
  nature, and surely only a\nfraction of all mathematical concepts is used in physics.
  It is true\nalso that the concepts which were chosen were not selected arbitrarily\nfrom
  a listing of mathematical terms but were developed, in many if not\nmost cases,
  independently by the physicist and recognized then as having\nbeen conceived before
  by the mathematician. It is not true, however, as\nis so often stated, that this
  had to happen because mathematics uses the\nsimplest possible concepts and these
  were bound to occur in any\nformalism. As we saw before, the concepts of mathematics
  are not chosen\nfor their conceptual simplicityeven sequences of pairs of numbers
  are\nfar from being the simplest conceptsbut for their amenability to clever\nmanipulations
  and to striking, brilliant arguments. Let us not forget\nthat the Hilbert space
  of quantum mechanics is the complex Hilbert\nspace, with a Hermitean scalar product.
  Surely to the unpreoccupied\nmind, complex numbers are far from natural or simple
  and they cannot be\nsuggested by physical observations. Furthermore, the use of
  complex\nnumbers is in this case not a calculational trick of applied mathematics\nbut
  comes close to being a necessity in the formulation of the laws of\nquantum mechanics.
  Finally, it now begins to appear that not only\ncomplex numbers but so-called analytic
  functions are destined to play a\ndecisive role in the formulation of quantum theory.
  I am referring to\nthe rapidly developing theory of dispersion relations.\n\n\n\nIt
  is difficult to avoid the impression that a miracle confronts us\nhere, quite comparable
  in its striking nature to the miracle that the\nhuman mind can string a thousand
  arguments together without getting\nitself into contradictions, or to the two miracles
  of the existence of\nlaws of nature and of the human mind's capacity to divine them.
  The\nobservation which comes closest to an explanation for the mathematical\nconcepts'
  cropping up in physics which I know is Einstein's statement\nthat the only physical
  theories which we are willing to accept are the\nbeautiful ones. It stands to argue
  that the concepts of mathematics,\nwhich invite the exercise of so much wit, have
  the quality of beauty.\nHowever, Einstein's observation can at best explain properties
  of\ntheories which we are willing to believe and has no reference to the\nintrinsic
  accuracy of the theory. We shall, therefore, turn to this\nlatter question.\n\n\n\nIS
  THE SUCCESS OF PHYSICAL THEORIES TRULY SURPRISING?\n\n\n\nA possible explanation
  of the physicist's use of mathematics to\nformulate his laws of nature is that he
  is a somewhat irresponsible\nperson. As a result, when he finds a connection between
  two quantities\nwhich resembles a connection well-known from mathematics, he will
  jump\nat the conclusion that the connection is that discussed in mathematics\nsimply
  because he does not know of any other similar connection. It is\nnot the intention
  of the present discussion to refute the charge that\nthe physicist is a somewhat
  irresponsible person. Perhaps he is.\nHowever, it is important to point out that
  the mathematical formulation\nof the physicist's often crude experience leads in
  an uncanny number of\ncases to an amazingly accurate description of a large class
  of\nphenomena. This shows that the mathematical language has more to commend\nit
  than being the only language which we can speak; it shows that it is,\nin a very
  real sense, the correct language. Let us consider a few\nexamples.\n\n\n\nThe first
  example is the oft-quoted one of planetary motion. The laws of\nfalling bodies became
  rather well established as a result of experiments\ncarried out principally in Italy.
  These experiments could not be very\naccurate in the sense in which we understand
  accuracy today partly\nbecause of the effect of air resistance and partly because
  of the\nimpossibility, at that time, to measure short time intervals.\nNevertheless,
  it is not surprising that, as a result of their studies,\nthe Italian natural scientists
  acquired a familiarity with the ways in\nwhich objects travel through the atmosphere.
  It was Newton who then\nbrought the law of freely falling objects into relation
  with the motion\nof the moon, noted that the parabola of the thrown rock's path
  on the\nearth and the circle of the moon's path in the sky are particular cases\nof
  the same mathematical object of an ellipse, and postulated the\nuniversal law of
  gravitation on the basis of a single, and at that time\nvery approximate, numerical
  coincidence. Philosophically, the law of\ngravitation as formulated by Newton was
  repugnant to his time and to\nhimself. Empirically, it was based on very scanty
  observations. The\nmathematical language in which it was formulated contained the
  concept\nof a second derivative and those of us who have tried to draw an\nosculating
  circle to a curve know that the second derivative is not a\nvery immediate concept.
  The law of gravity which Newton reluctantly\nestablished and which he could verify
  with an accuracy of about 4% has\nproved to be accurate to less than a ten thousandth
  of a per cent and\nbecame so closely associated with the idea of absolute accuracy
  that\nonly recently did physicists become again bold enough to inquire into\nthe
  limitations of its accuracy.\n[9 See, for instance, R. H. Dicke, Am. Sci., 25 (1959).]\nCertainly,
  the example of Newton's\nlaw, quoted over and over again, must be mentioned first
  as a monumental\nexample of a law, formulated in terms which appear simple to the\nmathematician,
  which has proved accurate beyond all reasonable\nexpectations. Let us just recapitulate
  our thesis on this example:\nfirst, the law, particularly since a second derivative
  appears in it, is\nsimple only to the mathematician, not to common sense or to\nnon-mathematically-minded
  freshmen; second, it is a conditional law of\nvery limited scope. It explains nothing
  about the earth which attracts\nGalileo's rocks, or about the circular form of the
  moon's orbit, or\nabout the planets of the sun. The explanation of these initial\nconditions
  is left to the geologist and the astronomer, and they have a\nhard time with them.\n\n\n\nThe
  second example is that of ordinary, elementary quantum mechanics.\nThis originated
  when Max Born noticed that some rules of computation,\ngiven by Heisenberg, were
  formally identical with the rules of\ncomputation with matrices, established a long
  time before by\nmathematicians. Born, Jordan, and Heisenberg then proposed to replace
  by\nmatrices the position and momentum variables of the equations of\nclassical
  mechanics. They applied the rules of matrix mechanics to a few\nhighly idealized
  problems and the results were quite satisfactory.\nHowever, there was, at that time,
  no rational evidence that their matrix\nmechanics would prove correct under more
  realistic conditions. Indeed,\nthey say \"if the mechanics as here proposed should
  already be correct in\nits essential traits.\" As a matter of fact, the first application
  of\ntheir mechanics to a realistic problem, that of the hydrogen atom, was\ngiven
  several months later, by Pauli. This application gave results in\nagreement with
  experience. This was satisfactory but still\nunderstandable because Heisenberg's
  rules of calculation were abstracted\nfrom problems which included the old theory
  of the hydrogen atom. The\nmiracle occurred only when matrix mechanics, or a mathematically\nequivalent
  theory, was applied to problems for which Heisenberg's\ncalculating rules were meaningless.
  Heisenberg's rules presupposed that\nthe classical equations of motion had solutions
  with certain periodicity\nproperties; and the equations of motion of the two electrons
  of the\nhelium atom, or of the even greater number of electrons of heavier\natoms,
  simply do not have these properties, so that Heisenberg's rules\ncannot be applied
  to these cases. Nevertheless, the calculation of the\nlowest energy level of helium,
  as carried out a few months ago by\nKinoshita at Cornell and by Bazley at the Bureau
  of Standards, agrees\nwith the experimental data within the accuracy of the observations,\nwhich
  is one part in ten million. Surely in this case we \"got something\nout\" of the
  equations that we did not put in.\n\n\n\nThe same is true of the qualitative characteristics
  of the \"complex\nspectra,\" that is, the spectra of heavier atoms. I wish to recall
  a\nconversation with Jordan, who told me, when the qualitative features of\nthe
  spectra were derived, that a disagreement of the rules derived from\nquantum mechanical
  theory and the rules established by empirical\nresearch would have provided the
  last opportunity to make a change in\nthe framework of matrix mechanics. In other
  words, Jordan felt that we\nwould have been, at least temporarily, helpless had
  an unexpected\ndisagreement occurred in the theory of the helium atom. This was,
  at\nthat time, developed by Kellner and by Hilleraas. The mathematical\nformalism
  was too dear and unchangeable so that, had the miracle of\nhelium which was mentioned
  before not occurred, a true crisis would have\narisen. Surely, physics would have
  overcome that crisis in one way or\nanother. It is true, on the other hand, that
  physics as we know it today\nwould not be possible without a constant recurrence
  of miracles similar\nto the one of the helium atom, which is perhaps the most striking\nmiracle
  that has occurred in the course of the development of elementary\nquantum mechanics,
  but by far not the only one. In fact, the number of\nanalogous miracles is limited,
  in our view, only by our willingness to\ngo after more similar ones. Quantum mechanics
  had, nevertheless, many\nalmost equally striking successes which gave us the firm
  conviction that\nit is, what we call, correct.\n\n\n\nThe last example is that of
  quantum electrodynamics, or the theory of\nthe Lamb shift. Whereas Newton's theory
  of gravitation still had obvious\nconnections with experience, experience entered
  the formulation of\nmatrix mechanics only in the refined or sublimated form of Heisenberg's\nprescriptions.
  The quantum theory of the Lamb shift, as conceived by\nBethe and established by
  Schwinger, is a purely mathematical theory and\nthe only direct contribution of
  experiment was to show the existence of\na measurable effect. The agreement with
  calculation is better than one\npart in a thousand.\n\n\n\nThe preceding three examples,
  which could be multiplied almost\nindefinitely, should illustrate the appropriateness
  and accuracy of the\nmathematical formulation of the laws of nature in terms of
  concepts\nchosen for their manipulability, the \"laws of nature\" being of almost\nfantastic
  accuracy but of strictly limited scope. I propose to refer to\nthe observation which
  these examples illustrate as the empirical law of\nepistemology. Together with the
  laws of invariance of physical theories,\nit is an indispensable foundation of these
  theories. Without the laws of\ninvariance the physical theories could have been
  given no foundation of\nfact; if the empirical law of epistemology were not correct,
  we would\nlack the encouragement and reassurance which are emotional necessities,\nwithout
  which the \"laws of nature\" could not have been successfully\nexplored. Dr. R.
  G. Sachs, with whom I discussed the empirical law of\nepistemology, called it an
  article of faith of the theoretical\nphysicist, and it is surely that. However,
  what he called our article of\nfaith can be well supported by actual examplesãmany
  examples in addition\nto the three which have been mentioned.\n\n\n\nTHE UNIQUENESS
  OF THE THEORIES OF PHYSICS \n\n\n\nThe empirical nature of the preceding observation
  seems to me to be\nself-evident. It surely is not a \"necessity of thought\" and
  it should\nnot be necessary, in order to prove this, to point to the fact that it\napplies
  only to a very small part of our knowledge of the inanimate\nworld. It is absurd
  to believe that the existence of mathematically\nsimple expressions for the second
  derivative of the position is\nself-evident, when no similar expressions for the
  position itself or for\nthe velocity exist. It is therefore surprising how readily
  the wonderful\ngift contained in the empirical law of epistemology was taken for\ngranted.
  The ability of the human mind to form a string of 1000\nconclusions and still remain
  \"right,\" which was mentioned before, is a\nsimilar gift.\n\n\n\nEvery empirical
  law has the disquieting quality that one does not know\nits limitations. We have
  seen that there are regularities in the events\nin the world around us which can
  be formulated in terms of mathematical\nconcepts with an uncanny accuracy. There
  are, on the other hand, aspects\nof the world concerning which we do not believe
  in the existence of any\naccurate regularities. We call these initial conditions.
  The question\nwhich presents itself is whether the different regularities, that
  is,\nthe various laws of nature which will be discovered, will fuse into a\nsingle
  consistent unit, or at least asymptotically approach such a\nfusion. Alternatively,
  it is possible that there always will be some\nlaws of nature which have nothing
  in common with each other. At present,\nthis is true, for instance, of the laws
  of heredity and of physics. It\nis even possible that some of the laws of nature
  will be in conflict\nwith each other in their implications, but each convincing
  enough in its\nown domain so that we may not be willing to abandon any of them.
  We may\nresign ourselves to such a state of affairs or our interest in clearing\nup
  the conflict between the various theories may fade out. We may lose\ninterest in
  the \"ultimate truth,\" that is, in a picture which is a\nconsistent fusion into
  a single unit of the little pictures, formed on\nthe various aspects of nature.\n\n\n\nIt
  may be useful to illustrate the alternatives by an example. We now\nhave, in physics,
  two theories of great power and interest: the theory\nof quantum phenomena and the
  theory of relativity. These two theories\nhave their roots in mutually exclusive
  groups of phenomena. Relativity\ntheory applies to macroscopic bodies, such as stars.
  The event of\ncoincidence, that is, in ultimate analysis of collision, is the\nprimitive
  event in the theory of relativity and defines a point in\nspace-time, or at least
  would define a point if the colliding panicles\nwere infinitely small. Quantum theory
  has its roots in the microscopic\nworld and, from its point of view, the event of
  coincidence, or of\ncollision, even if it takes place between particles of no spatial\nextent,
  is not primitive and not at all sharply isolated in space-time.\nThe two theories
  operate with different mathematical conceptsãthe four\ndimensional Riemann space
  and the infinite dimensional Hilbert space,\nrespectively. So far, the two theories
  could not be united, that is, no\nmathematical formulation exists to which both
  of these theories are\napproximations. All physicists believe that a union of the
  two theories\nis inherently possible and that we shall find it. Nevertheless, it
  is\npossible also to imagine that no union of the two theories can be found.\nThis
  example illustrates the two possibilities, of union and of\nconflict, mentioned
  before, both of which are conceivable.\n\n\n\nIn order to obtain an indication as
  to which alternative to expect\nultimately, we can pretend to be a little more ignorant
  than we are and\nplace ourselves at a lower level of knowledge than we actually
  possess.\nIf we can find a fusion of our theories on this lower level of\nintelligence,
  we can confidently expect that we will find a fusion of\nour theories also at our
  real level of intelligence. On the other hand,\nif we would arrive at mutually contradictory
  theories at a somewhat\nlower level of knowledge, the possibility of the permanence
  of\nconflicting theories cannot be excluded for ourselves either. The level\nof
  knowledge and ingenuity is a continuous variable and it is unlikely\nthat a relatively
  small variation of this continuous variable changes\nthe attainable picture of the
  world from inconsistent to consistent.\n[10 This passage was written after a great
  deal of hesitation. The writer\nis convinced that it is useful, in epistemological
  discussions, to\nabandon the idealization that the level of human intelligence has
  a\nsingular position on an absolute scale. In some cases it may even be\nuseful
  to consider the attainment which is possible at the level of the\nintelligence of
  some other species. However, the writer also realizes\nthat his thinking along the
  lines indicated in the text was too brief\nand not subject to sufficient critical
  appraisal to be reliable.]\n\nConsidered from this point of view, the fact that
  some of the theories\nwhich we know to be false give such amazingly accurate results
  is an\nadverse factor. Had we somewhat less knowledge, the group of phenomena\nwhich
  these \"false\" theories explain would appear to us to be large\nenough to \"prove\"
  these theories. However, these theories are considered\nto be \"false\" by us just
  for the reason that they are, in ultimate\nanalysis, incompatible with more encompassing
  pictures and, if\nsufficiently many such false theories are discovered, they are
  bound to\nprove also to be in conflict with each other. Similarly, it is possible\nthat
  the theories, which we consider to be \"proved\" by a number of\nnumerical agreements
  which appears to be large enough for us, are false\nbecause they are in conflict
  with a possible more encompassing theory\nwhich is beyond our means of discovery.
  If this were true, we would have\nto expect conflicts between our theories as soon
  as their number grows\nbeyond a certain point and as soon as they cover a sufficiently
  large\nnumber of groups of phenomena. In contrast to the article of faith of\nthe
  theoretical physicist mentioned before, this is the nightmare of the\ntheorist.\n\n\n\nLet
  us consider a few examples of \"false\" theories which give, in view\nof their falseness,
  alarmingly accurate descriptions of groups of\nphenomena. With some goodwill, one
  can dismiss some of the evidence\nwhich these examples provide. The success of Bohr's
  early and pioneering\nideas on the atom was always a rather narrow one and the same
  applies to\nPtolemy's epicycles. Our present vantage point gives an accurate\ndescription
  of all phenomena which these more primitive theories can\ndescribe. The same is
  not true any longer of the so-called free-electron\ntheory, which gives a marvelously
  accurate picture of many, if not most,\nproperties of metals, semiconductors, and
  insulators. In particular, it\nexplains the fact, never properly understood on the
  basis of the \"real\ntheory,\" that insulators show a specific resistance to electricity
  which\nmay be 1026 times greater than that of metals. In fact, there is no\nexperimental
  evidence to show that the resistance is not infinite under\nthe conditions under
  which the free-electron theory would lead us to\nexpect an infinite resistance.
  Nevertheless, we are convinced that the\nfree-electron theory is a crude approximation
  which should be replaced,\nin the description of all phenomena concerning solids,
  by a more\naccurate picture.\n\n\n\nIf viewed from our real vantage point, the situation
  presented by the\nfree-electron theory is irritating but is not likely to forebode
  any\ninconsistencies which are unsurmountable for us. The free-electron\ntheory
  raises doubts as to how much we should trust numerical agreement\nbetween theory
  and experiment as evidence for the correctness of the\ntheory. We are used to such
  doubts.\n\n\n\nA much more difficult and confusing situation would arise if we could,\nsome
  day, establish a theory of the phenomena of consciousness, or of\nbiology, which
  would be as coherent and convincing as our present\ntheories of the inanimate world.
  Mendel's laws of inheritance and the\nsubsequent work on genes may well form the
  beginning of such a theory as\nfar as biology is concerned. Furthermore,, it is
  quite possible that an\nabstract argument can be found which shows that there is
  a conflict\nbetween such a theory and the accepted principles of physics. The\nargument
  could be of such abstract nature that it might not be possible\nto resolve the conflict,
  in favor of one or of the other theory, by an\nexperiment. Such a situation would
  put a heavy strain on our faith in\nour theories and on our belief in the reality
  of the concepts which we\nform. It would give us a deep sense of frustration in
  our search for\nwhat I called \"the ultimate truth.\" The reason that such a situation
  is\nconceivable is that, fundamentally, we do not know why our theories work\nso
  well. Hence, their accuracy may not prove their truth and\nconsistency. Indeed,
  it is this writer's belief that something rather\nakin to the situation which was
  described above exists if the present\nlaws of heredity and of physics are confronted.\n\n\n\nLet
  me end on a more cheerful note. The miracle of the appropriateness\nof the language
  of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of\nphysics is a wonderful gift which
  we neither understand nor deserve. We\nshould be grateful for it and hope that it
  will remain valid in future\nresearch and that it will extend, for better or for
  worse, to our\npleasure, even though perhaps also to our bafflement, to wide branches\nof
  learning.\n\n\n\nMerci W. Cooper\n\n\n\nHistoire et philosophie des mathmatiques\nLe

  beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal\nto any part of
  our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of\npainting or music, yet sublimely
  pure, and capable of a stern perfection\nsuch as only the greatest art can show.
  The true spirit of delight, the\nexaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which
  is the touchstone of\nthe highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely
  as in\npoetry.\n\n                           --BERTRAND RUSSELL, Study of Mathematics
  \n\nTHERE IS A story about two friends, who were classmates in high school,\ntalking
  about their jobs. One of them became a statistician and was\nworking on population
  trends. He showed a reprint to his former\nclassmate. The reprint started, as usual,
  with the Gaussian distribution\nand the statistician explained to his former classmate
  the meaning of\nthe symbols for the actual population, for the average population,
  and\nso on. His classmate was a bit incredulous and was not quite sure\nwhether
  the statistician was pulling his leg. \"How can you know that?\"\nwas his query.
  \"And what is this symbol here?\" \"Oh,\" said the\nstatistician, \"this is pi.\"
  \"What is that?\" \"The ratio of the\ncircumference of the circle to its diameter.\"
  \"Well, now you are pushing\nyour joke too far,\" said the classmate, \"surely the
  population has\nnothing to do with the circumference of the circle.\"\n\nNaturally,
  we are inclined to smile about the simplicity of the\nclassmate's approach. Nevertheless,
  when I heard this story, I had to\nadmit to an eerie feeling because, surely, the
  reaction of the classmate\nbetrayed only plain common sense. I was even more confused
  when, not\nmany days later, someone came to me and expressed his bewilderment\nThe
  preceding two stories illustrate the two main points which are the\nsubjects of
  the present discourse. The first point is that mathematical\nconcepts turn up in
  entirely unexpected connections. Moreover, they\noften permit an unexpectedly close
  and accurate description of the\nphenomena in these connections. Secondly, just
  because of this\ncircumstance, and because we do not understand the reasons of their\nusefulness,
  we cannot know whether a theory formulated in terms of\nmathematical concepts is
  uniquely appropriate. We are in a position\nsimilar to that of a man who was provided
  with a bunch of keys and who,\nhaving to open several doors in succession, always
  hit on the right key\non the first or second trial. He became skeptical concerning
  the\nuniqueness of the coordination between keys and doors.\n\nMost of what will
  be said on these questions will not be new; it has\nprobably occurred to most scientists
  in one form or another. My\nprincipal aim is to illuminate it from several sides.
  The first point is\nthat the enormous usefulness of mathematics in the natural sciences
  is\nsomething bordering on the mysterious and that there is no rational\nexplanation
  for it. Second, it is just this uncanny usefulness of\nmathematical concepts that
  raises the question of the uniqueness of our\nphysical theories. In order to establish
  the first point, that\nmathematics plays an unreasonably important role in physics,
  it will be\nuseful to say a few words on the question, \"What is mathematics?\",
  then,\n\"What is physics?\", then, how mathematics enters physical theories, and\nlast,
  why the success of mathematics in its role in physics appears so\nbaffling. Much
  less will be said on the second point: the uniqueness of\nthe theories of physics.
  A proper answer to this question would require\nelaborate experimental and theoretical
  work which has not been\nundertaken to date.\n\nWHAT IS MATHEMATICS?\n\nSomebody
  once said that philosophy is the misuse of a terminology which\nwas invented just
  for this purpose.\nThe complex numbers provide a particularly striking example for
  the\nforegoing. Certainly, nothing in our experience suggests the\nintroduction
  of these quantities. Indeed, if a mathematician is asked to\njustify his interest
  in complex numbers, he will point, with some\nindignation, to the many beautiful
  theorems in the theory of equations,\nof power series, and of analytic functions
  in general, which owe their\norigin to the introduction of complex numbers. The
  mathematician is not\nwilling to give up his interest in these most beautiful accomplishments\nof
  his genius. \n[4 The reader may be interested, in this connection, in Hilbert's
  rather\ntesty remarks about intuitionism which \"seeks to break up and to\ndisfigure
  mathematics,\" Abh. Math. Sem., Univ. Hamburg, 157 (1922), or\nGesammelte Werke
  (Berlin: Springer, 1935), p. 188.]\n\nWHAT IS PHYSICS?\n\nThe physicist is interested
  in discovering the laws of inanimate nature.\nIn order to understand this statement,
  it is necessary to analyze the\nconcept, \"law of nature.\"\n\nThe world around
  us is of baffling complexity and the most obvious fact\nabout it is that we cannot
  predict the future. Although the joke\nattributes only to the optimist the view
  that the future is uncertain,\nthe optimist is right in this case: the future is
  unpredictable. It is,\nas Schrodinger has remarked, a miracle that in spite of the
  baffling\ncomplexity of the world, certain regularities in the events could be\ndiscovered.
  One such regularity, discovered by Galileo, is that two\nrocks, dropped at the same
  time from the same height, reach the ground\nat the same time. The laws of nature
  are concerned with such\nregularities. Galileo's regularity is a prototype of a
  large class of\nregularities. It is a surprising regularity for three reasons.\n\nThe
  first reason that it is surprising is that it is true not only in\nPisa, and in
  Galileo's time, it is true everywhere on the Earth, was\nalways true, and will always
  be true. This property of the regularity is\na recognized invariance property and,
  as I had occasion to point out\nsome time ago, without invariance principles similar
  to those implied in\nthe preceding generalization of Galileo's observation, physics
  would not\nbe possible. The second surprising feature is that the regularity which\nwe
  are discussing is independent of so many conditions which could have\nan effect
  on it. It is valid no matter whether it rains or not, whether\nthe experiment is
  carried out in a room or from the Leaning Tower, no\nmatter whether the person who
  drops the rocks is a man or a woman. It is\nvalid even if the two rocks are dropped,
  simultaneously and from the\nsame height, by two different people. There are, obviously,
  innumerable\nother conditions which are all immaterial from the point of view of
  the\nvalidity of Galileo's regularity. The irrelevancy of so many\ncircumstances
  which could play a role in the phenomenon observed has\nalso been called an invariance.
  However, this invariance is of a\ndifferent character from the preceding one since
  it cannot be formulated\nas a general principle. The exploration of the conditions
  which do, and\nwhich do not, influence a phenomenon is part of the early experimental\nexploration
  of a field. It is the skill and ingenuity of the\nexperimenter which show him phenomena
  which depend on a relatively\nnarrow set of relatively easily realizable and reproducible
  conditions.\nThe preceding two points, though highly significant from the point
  of\nview of the philosopher, are not the ones which surprised Galileo most,\nnor
  do they contain a specific law of nature. The law of nature is\ncontained in the
  statement that the length of time which it takes for a\nheavy object to fall from
  a given height is independent of the size,\nmaterial, and shape of the body which
  drops. In the framework of\nNewton's second \"law,\" this amounts to the statement
  that the\ngravitational force which acts on the falling body is proportional to\nits
  mass but independent of the size, material, and shape of the body\nwhich falls.\n\nThe
  preceding discussion is intended to remind us, first, that it is not\nat all natural
  that \"laws of nature\" exist, much less that man is able\nto discover them.\nAs
  regards the present state of the world, such as the existence of the\nearth on which
  we live and on which Galileo's experiments were\nperformed, the existence of the
  sun and of all our surroundings, the\nlaws of nature are entirely silent. It is
  in consonance with this,\nfirst, that the laws of nature can be used to predict
  future events only\nunder exceptional circumstancesãwhen all the relevant determinants
  of\nthe present state of the world are known. It is also in consonance with\nthis
  that the construction of machines, the functioning of which he can\nforesee, constitutes
  the most spectacular accomplishment of the\nphysicist. In these machines, the physicist
  creates a situation in which\nall the relevant coordinates are known so that the
  behavior of the\nmachine can be predicted. Radars and nuclear reactors are examples
  of\nsuch machines.\n\nThe principal purpose of the preceding discussion is to point
  out that\nthe laws of nature are all conditional statements and they relate only\nto
  a very small part of our knowledge of the world. Thus, classical\nmechanics, which
  is the best known prototype of a physical theory, gives\nthe second derivatives
  of the positional coordinates of all bodies, on\nthe basis of the knowledge of the
  positions, etc., of these bodies. It\ngives no information on the existence, the
  present positions, or\nvelocities of these bodies. It should be mentioned, for the
  sake of\naccuracy, that we discovered about thirty years ago that even the\nconditional
  statements cannot be entirely precise: that the conditional\nstatements are probability
  laws which enable us only to place\nintelligent bets on future properties of the
  inanimate world, based on\nthe knowledge of the present state. They do not allow
  us to make\ncategorical statements, not even categorical statements conditional
  on\nthe present state of the world. The probabilistic nature of the \"laws of\nnature\"
  manifests itself in the case of machines also, and can be\nverified, at least in
  the case of nuclear reactors, if one runs them at\nvery low power. However, the
  additional limitation of the scope of the\nlaws of nature which follows from their
  probabilistic nature will play\nno role in the rest of the discussion.\n\nTHE ROLE
  OF MATHEMATICS IN PHYSICAL THEORIES \n\nHaving refreshed our minds as to the essence
  of mathematics and physics,\nwe should be in a better position to review the role
  of mathematics in\nphysical theories.\n\nNaturally, we do use mathematics in everyday
  physics to evaluate the\nresults of the laws of nature, to apply the conditional
  statements to\nthe particular conditions which happen to prevail or happen to interest\nus.
  In order that this be possible, the laws of nature must already be\nformulated in
  mathematical language. However, the role of evaluating the\nconsequences of already
  established theories is not the most important\nrole of mathematics in physics.
  Mathematics, or, rather, applied\nmathematics, is not so much the master of the
  situation in this\nfunction: it is merely serving as a tool.\n\nMathematics does
  play, however, also a more sovereign role in physics.\nThis was already implied
  in the statement, made when discussing the role\nof applied mathematics, that the
  laws of nature must have been\nformulated in the language of mathematics to be an
  object for the use of\napplied mathematics. The statement that the laws of nature
  are written\nin the language of mathematics was properly made three hundred years\nago;[8
  It is attributed to Galileo]\n it is now more true than ever before. In order to
  show the\nimportance which mathematical concepts possess in the formulation of the\nlaws
  of physics, let us recall, as an example, the axioms of quantum\nmechanics as formulated,
  explicitly, by the great physicist, Dirac.\nThere are two basic concepts in quantum
  mechanics: states and\nobservables. The states are vectors in Hilbert space, the
  observables\nself-adjoint operators on these vectors. The possible values of the\nobservations
  are the characteristic values of the operatorsãbut we had\nbetter stop here lest
  we engage in a listing of the mathematical\nconcepts developed in the theory of
  linear operators.\n\nIt is true, of course, that physics chooses certain mathematical\nconcepts
  for the formulation of the laws of nature, and surely only a\nfraction of all mathematical
  concepts is used in physics. It is true\nalso that the concepts which were chosen
  were not selected arbitrarily\nfrom a listing of mathematical terms but were developed,
  in many if not\nmost cases, independently by the physicist and recognized then as
  having\nbeen conceived before by the mathematician. It is not true, however, as\nis
  so often stated, that this had to happen because mathematics uses the\nsimplest
  possible concepts and these were bound to occur in any\nformalism. As we saw before,
  the concepts of mathematics are not chosen\nfor their conceptual simplicityeven
  sequences of pairs of numbers are\nfar from being the simplest conceptsbut for their
  amenability to clever\nmanipulations and to striking, brilliant arguments. Let us
  not forget\nthat the Hilbert space of quantum mechanics is the complex Hilbert\nspace,
  with a Hermitean scalar product. Surely to the unpreoccupied\nmind, complex numbers
  are far from natural or simple and they cannot be\nsuggested by physical observations.
  Furthermore, the use of complex\nnumbers is in this case not a calculational trick
  of applied mathematics\nbut comes close to being a necessity in the formulation
  of the laws of\nquantum mechanics. Finally, it now begins to appear that not only\ncomplex
  numbers but so-called analytic functions are destined to play a\ndecisive role in
  the formulation of quantum theory. I am referring to\nthe rapidly developing theory
  of dispersion relations.\n\nIt is difficult to avoid the impression that a miracle
  confronts us\nhere, quite comparable in its striking nature to the miracle that
  the\nhuman mind can string a thousand arguments together without getting\nitself
  into contradictions, or to the two miracles of the existence of\nlaws of nature
  and of the human mind's capacity to divine them. The\nobservation which comes closest
  to an explanation for the mathematical\nconcepts' cropping up in physics which I
  know is Einstein's statement\nthat the only physical theories which we are willing
  to accept are the\nbeautiful ones. It stands to argue that the concepts of mathematics,\nwhich
  invite the exercise of so much wit, have the quality of beauty.\nHowever, Einstein's
  observation can at best explain properties of\ntheories which we are willing to
  believe and has no reference to the\nintrinsic accuracy of the theory. We shall,
  therefore, turn to this\nlatter question.\n\nIS THE SUCCESS OF PHYSICAL THEORIES
  TRULY SURPRISING?\n\nA possible explanation of the physicist's use of mathematics
  to\nformulate his laws of nature is that he is a somewhat irresponsible\nperson.
  As a result, when he finds a connection between two quantities\nwhich resembles
  a connection well-known from mathematics, he will jump\nat the conclusion that the
  connection is that discussed in mathematics\nsimply because he does not know of
  any other similar connection. It is\nnot the intention of the present discussion
  to refute the charge that\nthe physicist is a somewhat irresponsible person. Perhaps
  he is.\nHowever, it is important to point out that the mathematical formulation\nof
  the physicist's often crude experience leads in an uncanny number of\ncases to an
  amazingly accurate description of a large class of\nphenomena. This shows that the
  mathematical language has more to commend\nit than being the only language which
  we can speak; it shows that it is,\nin a very real sense, the correct language.
  Let us consider a few\nexamples.\n\nThe first example is the oft-quoted one of planetary
  motion. The laws of\nfalling bodies became rather well established as a result of
  experiments\ncarried out principally in Italy. These experiments could not be very\naccurate
  in the sense in which we understand accuracy today partly\nbecause of the effect
  of air resistance and partly because of the\nimpossibility, at that time, to measure
  short time intervals.\nNevertheless, it is not surprising that, as a result of their
  studies,\nthe Italian natural scientists acquired a familiarity with the ways in\nwhich
  objects travel through the atmosphere. It was Newton who then\nbrought the law of
  freely falling objects into relation with the motion\nof the moon, noted that the
  parabola of the thrown rock's path on the\nearth and the circle of the moon's path
  in the sky are particular cases\nof the same mathematical object of an ellipse,
  and postulated the\nuniversal law of gravitation on the basis of a single, and at
  that time\nvery approximate, numerical coincidence. Philosophically, the law of\ngravitation
  as formulated by Newton was repugnant to his time and to\nhimself. Empirically,
  it was based on very scanty observations. The\nmathematical language in which it
  was formulated contained the concept\nof a second derivative and those of us who
  have tried to draw an\nosculating circle to a curve know that the second derivative
  is not a\nvery immediate concept. The law of gravity which Newton reluctantly\nestablished
  and which he could verify with an accuracy of about 4% has\nproved to be accurate
  to less than a ten thousandth of a per cent and\nbecame so closely associated with
  the idea of absolute accuracy that\nonly recently did physicists become again bold
  enough to inquire into\nthe limitations of its accuracy.\n[9 See, for instance,
  R. H. Dicke, Am. Sci., 25 (1959).]\nCertainly, the example of Newton's\nlaw, quoted
  over and over again, must be mentioned first as a monumental\nexample of a law,
  formulated in terms which appear simple to the\nmathematician, which has proved
  accurate beyond all reasonable\nexpectations. Let us just recapitulate our thesis
  on this example:\nfirst, the law, particularly since a second derivative appears
  in it, is\nsimple only to the mathematician, not to common sense or to\nnon-mathematically-minded
  freshmen; second, it is a conditional law of\nvery limited scope. It explains nothing
  about the earth which attracts\nGalileo's rocks, or about the circular form of the
  moon's orbit, or\nabout the planets of the sun. The explanation of these initial\nconditions
  is left to the geologist and the astronomer, and they have a\nhard time with them.\n\nThe
  second example is that of ordinary, elementary quantum mechanics.\nThis originated
  when Max Born noticed that some rules of computation,\ngiven by Heisenberg, were
  formally identical with the rules of\ncomputation with matrices, established a long
  time before by\nmathematicians. Born, Jordan, and Heisenberg then proposed to replace
  by\nmatrices the position and momentum variables of the equations of\nclassical
  mechanics. They applied the rules of matrix mechanics to a few\nhighly idealized
  problems and the results were quite satisfactory.\nHowever, there was, at that time,
  no rational evidence that their matrix\nmechanics would prove correct under more
  realistic conditions. Indeed,\nthey say \"if the mechanics as here proposed should
  already be correct in\nits essential traits.\" As a matter of fact, the first application
  of\ntheir mechanics to a realistic problem, that of the hydrogen atom, was\ngiven
  several months later, by Pauli. This application gave results in\nagreement with
  experience. This was satisfactory but still\nunderstandable because Heisenberg's
  rules of calculation were abstracted\nfrom problems which included the old theory
  of the hydrogen atom. The\nmiracle occurred only when matrix mechanics, or a mathematically\nequivalent
  theory, was applied to problems for which Heisenberg's\ncalculating rules were meaningless.
  Heisenberg's rules presupposed that\nthe classical equations of motion had solutions
  with certain periodicity\nproperties; and the equations of motion of the two electrons
  of the\nhelium atom, or of the even greater number of electrons of heavier\natoms,
  simply do not have these properties, so that Heisenberg's rules\ncannot be applied
  to these cases. Nevertheless, the calculation of the\nlowest energy level of helium,
  as carried out a few months ago by\nKinoshita at Cornell and by Bazley at the Bureau
  of Standards, agrees\nwith the experimental data within the accuracy of the observations,\nwhich
  is one part in ten million. Surely in this case we \"got something\nout\" of the
  equations that we did not put in.\n\nThe same is true of the qualitative characteristics
  of the \"complex\nspectra,\" that is, the spectra of heavier atoms. I wish to recall
  a\nconversation with Jordan, who told me, when the qualitative features of\nthe
  spectra were derived, that a disagreement of the rules derived from\nquantum mechanical
  theory and the rules established by empirical\nresearch would have provided the
  last opportunity to make a change in\nthe framework of matrix mechanics. In other
  words, Jordan felt that we\nwould have been, at least temporarily, helpless had
  an unexpected\ndisagreement occurred in the theory of the helium atom. This was,
  at\nthat time, developed by Kellner and by Hilleraas. The mathematical\nformalism
  was too dear and unchangeable so that, had the miracle of\nhelium which was mentioned
  before not occurred, a true crisis would have\narisen. Surely, physics would have
  overcome that crisis in one way or\nanother. It is true, on the other hand, that
  physics as we know it today\nwould not be possible without a constant recurrence
  of miracles similar\nto the one of the helium atom, which is perhaps the most striking\nmiracle
  that has occurred in the course of the development of elementary\nquantum mechanics,
  but by far not the only one. In fact, the number of\nanalogous miracles is limited,
  in our view, only by our willingness to\ngo after more similar ones. Quantum mechanics
  had, nevertheless, many\nalmost equally striking successes which gave us the firm
  conviction that\nit is, what we call, correct.\n\nThe last example is that of quantum
  electrodynamics, or the theory of\nthe Lamb shift. Whereas Newton's theory of gravitation
  still had obvious\nconnections with experience, experience entered the formulation
  of\nmatrix mechanics only in the refined or sublimated form of Heisenberg's\nprescriptions.
  The quantum theory of the Lamb shift, as conceived by\nBethe and established by
  Schwinger, is a purely mathematical theory and\nthe only direct contribution of
  experiment was to show the existence of\na measurable effect. The agreement with
  calculation is better than one\npart in a thousand.\n\nThe preceding three examples,
  which could be multiplied almost\nindefinitely, should illustrate the appropriateness
  and accuracy of the\nmathematical formulation of the laws of nature in terms of
  concepts\nchosen for their manipulability, the \"laws of nature\" being of almost\nfantastic
  accuracy but of strictly limited scope. I propose to refer to\nthe observation which
  these examples illustrate as the empirical law of\nepistemology. Together with the
  laws of invariance of physical theories,\nit is an indispensable foundation of these
  theories. Without the laws of\ninvariance the physical theories could have been
  given no foundation of\nfact; if the empirical law of epistemology were not correct,
  we would\nlack the encouragement and reassurance which are emotional necessities,\nwithout
  which the \"laws of nature\" could not have been successfully\nexplored. Dr. R.
  G. Sachs, with whom I discussed the empirical law of\nepistemology, called it an
  article of faith of the theoretical\nphysicist, and it is surely that. However,
  what he called our article of\nfaith can be well supported by actual examplesãmany
  examples in addition\nto the three which have been mentioned.\n\nTHE UNIQUENESS
  OF THE THEORIES OF PHYSICS \n\nThe empirical nature of the preceding observation
  seems to me to be\nself-evident. It surely is not a \"necessity of thought\" and
  it should\nnot be necessary, in order to prove this, to point to the fact that it\napplies
  only to a very small part of our knowledge of the inanimate\nworld. It is absurd
  to believe that the existence of mathematically\nsimple expressions for the second
  derivative of the position is\nself-evident, when no similar expressions for the
  position itself or for\nthe velocity exist. It is therefore surprising how readily
  the wonderful\ngift contained in the empirical law of epistemology was taken for\ngranted.
  The ability of the human mind to form a string of 1000\nconclusions and still remain
  \"right,\" which was mentioned before, is a\nsimilar gift.\n\nEvery empirical law
  has the disquieting quality that one does not know\nits limitations. We have seen
  that there are regularities in the events\nin the world around us which can be formulated
  in terms of mathematical\nconcepts with an uncanny accuracy. There are, on the other
  hand, aspects\nof the world concerning which we do not believe in the existence
  of any\naccurate regularities. We call these initial conditions. The question\nwhich
  presents itself is whether the different regularities, that is,\nthe various laws
  of nature which will be discovered, will fuse into a\nsingle consistent unit, or
  at least asymptotically approach such a\nfusion. Alternatively, it is possible that
  there always will be some\nlaws of nature which have nothing in common with each
  other. At present,\nthis is true, for instance, of the laws of heredity and of physics.
  It\nis even possible that some of the laws of nature will be in conflict\nwith each
  other in their implications, but each convincing enough in its\nown domain so that
  we may not be willing to abandon any of them. We may\nresign ourselves to such a
  state of affairs or our interest in clearing\nup the conflict between the various
  theories may fade out. We may lose\ninterest in the \"ultimate truth,\" that is,
  in a picture which is a\nconsistent fusion into a single unit of the little pictures,
  formed on\nthe various aspects of nature.\n\nIt may be useful to illustrate the
  alternatives by an example. We now\nhave, in physics, two theories of great power
  and interest: the theory\nof quantum phenomena and the theory of relativity. These
  two theories\nhave their roots in mutually exclusive groups of phenomena. Relativity\ntheory
  applies to macroscopic bodies, such as stars. The event of\ncoincidence, that is,
  in ultimate analysis of collision, is the\nprimitive event in the theory of relativity
  and defines a point in\nspace-time, or at least would define a point if the colliding
  panicles\nwere infinitely small. Quantum theory has its roots in the microscopic\nworld
  and, from its point of view, the event of coincidence, or of\ncollision, even if
  it takes place between particles of no spatial\nextent, is not primitive and not
  at all sharply isolated in space-time.\nThe two theories operate with different
  mathematical conceptsãthe four\ndimensional Riemann space and the infinite dimensional
  Hilbert space,\nrespectively. So far, the two theories could not be united, that
  is, no\nmathematical formulation exists to which both of these theories are\napproximations.
  All physicists believe that a union of the two theories\nis inherently possible
  and that we shall find it. Nevertheless, it is\npossible also to imagine that no
  union of the two theories can be found.\nThis example illustrates the two possibilities,
  of union and of\nconflict, mentioned before, both of which are conceivable.\n\nIn
  order to obtain an indication as to which alternative to expect\nultimately, we
  can pretend to be a little more ignorant than we are and\nplace ourselves at a lower
  level of knowledge than we actually possess.\nIf we can find a fusion of our theories
  on this lower level of\nintelligence, we can confidently expect that we will find
  a fusion of\nour theories also at our real level of intelligence. On the other hand,\nif
  we would arrive at mutually contradictory theories at a somewhat\nlower level of
  knowledge, the possibility of the permanence of\nconflicting theories cannot be
  excluded for ourselves either. The level\nof knowledge and ingenuity is a continuous
  variable and it is unlikely\nthat a relatively small variation of this continuous
  variable changes\nthe attainable picture of the world from inconsistent to consistent.\n[10
  This passage was written after a great deal of hesitation. The writer\nis convinced
  that it is useful, in epistemological discussions, to\nabandon the idealization
  that the level of human intelligence has a\nsingular position on an absolute scale.
  In some cases it may even be\nuseful to consider the attainment which is possible
  at the level of the\nintelligence of some other species. However, the writer also
  realizes\nthat his thinking along the lines indicated in the text was too brief\nand
  not subject to sufficient critical appraisal to be reliable.]\n\nConsidered from
  this point of view, the fact that some of the theories\nwhich we know to be false
  give such amazingly accurate results is an\nadverse factor. Had we somewhat less
  knowledge, the group of phenomena\nwhich these \"false\" theories explain would
  appear to us to be large\nenough to \"prove\" these theories. However, these theories
  are considered\nto be \"false\" by us just for the reason that they are, in ultimate\nanalysis,
  incompatible with more encompassing pictures and, if\nsufficiently many such false
  theories are discovered, they are bound to\nprove also to be in conflict with each
  other. Similarly, it is possible\nthat the theories, which we consider to be \"proved\"
  by a number of\nnumerical agreements which appears to be large enough for us, are
  false\nbecause they are in conflict with a possible more encompassing theory\nwhich
  is beyond our means of discovery. If this were true, we would have\nto expect conflicts
  between our theories as soon as their number grows\nbeyond a certain point and as
  soon as they cover a sufficiently large\nnumber of groups of phenomena. In contrast
  to the article of faith of\nthe theoretical physicist mentioned before, this is
  the nightmare of the\ntheorist.\n\nLet us consider a few examples of \"false\" theories
  which give, in view\nof their falseness, alarmingly accurate descriptions of groups
  of\nphenomena. With some goodwill, one can dismiss some of the evidence\nwhich these
  examples provide. The success of Bohr's early and pioneering\nideas on the atom
  was always a rather narrow one and the same applies to\nPtolemy's epicycles. Our
  present vantage point gives an accurate\ndescription of all phenomena which these
  more primitive theories can\ndescribe. The same is not true any longer of the so-called
  free-electron\ntheory, which gives a marvelously accurate picture of many, if not
  most,\nproperties of metals, semiconductors, and insulators. In particular, it\nexplains
  the fact, never properly understood on the basis of the \"real\ntheory,\" that insulators
  show a specific resistance to electricity which\nmay be 1026 times greater than
  that of metals. In fact, there is no\nexperimental evidence to show that the resistance
  is not infinite under\nthe conditions under which the free-electron theory would
  lead us to\nexpect an infinite resistance. Nevertheless, we are convinced that the\nfree-electron
  theory is a crude approximation which should be replaced,\nin the description of
  all phenomena concerning solids, by a more\naccurate picture.\n\nIf viewed from
  our real vantage point, the situation presented by the\nfree-electron theory is
  irritating but is not likely to forebode any\ninconsistencies which are unsurmountable
  for us. The free-electron\ntheory raises doubts as to how much we should trust numerical
  agreement\nbetween theory and experiment as evidence for the correctness of the\ntheory.
  We are used to such doubts.\n\nA much more difficult and confusing situation would
  arise if we could,\nsome day, establish a theory of the phenomena of consciousness,
  or of\nbiology, which would be as coherent and convincing as our present\ntheories
  of the inanimate world. Mendel's laws of inheritance and the\nsubsequent work on
  genes may well form the beginning of such a theory as\nfar as biology is concerned.
  Furthermore,, it is quite possible that an\nabstract argument can be found which
  shows that there is a conflict\nbetween such a theory and the accepted principles
  of physics. The\nargument could be of such abstract nature that it might not be
  possible\nto resolve the conflict, in favor of one or of the other theory, by an\nexperiment.
  Such a situation would put a heavy strain on our faith in\nour theories and on our
  belief in the reality of the concepts which we\nform. It would give us a deep sense
  of frustration in our search for\nwhat I called \"the ultimate truth.\" The reason
  that such a situation is\nconceivable is that, fundamentally, we do not know why
  our theories work\nso well. Hence, their accuracy may not prove their truth and\nconsistency.
  Indeed, it is this writer's belief that something rather\nakin to the situation
  which was described above exists if the present\nlaws of heredity and of physics
  are confronted.\n\nLet me end on a more cheerful note. The miracle of the appropriateness\nof
  the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of\nphysics is a wonderful
  gift which we neither understand nor deserve. We\nshould be grateful for it and
  hope that it will remain valid in future\nresearch and that it will extend, for
  better or for worse, to our\npleasure, even though perhaps also to our bafflement,
  to wide branches\nof learning.\n\nMerci W. Cooper\n\nHistoire et philosophie des
