                  CLASSIFICATION OFTHE SCIENCES
- |2
                  The aim of every classification is to establish order
- |2
                      in things and in thought. When this operation is applied in the
- |2
                      sciences at a given time in their evolution, it provides a faithful though
- |2
                      provisional picture of the scientific knowledge at that time. By enabling
- |2
                      us to take such an inventory of our knowledge, classification provides
- |2
                      a sort of spatiotemporal cross section of the sphere of ideas and culture
- |2
                      of a given period. The value
- |2
                       of classification, however, goes beyond a mere inven- tory or “table of contents,” no
- |2
                      matter how complete. The very fact that classification appeals to
- |2
                      logical criteria which may possibly be subjective or objective in
- |2
                      nature gives us an initial idea of the obstacles con- fronting the classifier, difficulties scarcely
- |2
                      encountered in the preparation of a catalogue, properly so called.
- |2
                      Consequently, a well conducted effort at surveying the history of the
- |2
                      classification of the sciences may be valuable in leading us to discover
- |2
                      the connections and analogies existing among the different fields of knowl- edge at a given time, and within the
- |2
                      context of a particular type of civilization. However, history of any
- |2
                      sort is not a static phenomenon, but follows an evolu- tionary course. We are obliged therefore to study
- |2
                      the sciences and their classification considered essentially as an
- |2
                      historical process subject to continuous develop-
- |2
                          ment. We shall thus see the appearance of the great currents of
- |2
                      ideas which have sometimes dominated many centuries and we can seek what is
- |2
                      less apparent, namely, the structure underlying these ideas.
- |2
                  We can already discern among the ancients this need to classify and discover
- |2
                      relationships and hidden con- nections in
- |2
                      order to obtain a total view of reality and to explain the mechanism of the
- |2
                      universe. Take Pythagoras, for example, whose life was described by
- |2
                      Porphyry and Iamblichus, and whose teaching was addressed primarily to
- |2
                      those initiated in his circle. According to Pythagoras, geometry,
- |2
                      arithmetic (theory of numbers), and music (acoustics) lead to the
- |2
                      discovery of the secrets of number and harmony; only the sage by
- |2
                      starting with these principles is able to reconstruct reality (Stobaeus,
- |2
                          Florilège, I, 62-63). Through Archy- tas of Tarentum, Plato had been introduced
- |2
                      to the Pythagorean method, as can be seen in several places in the Timaeus, the Platonic dialogue on which Proclus
- |2
                      wrote a commentary in four books.
- |2
                  Plato thought that ideas should be ordered according to their extension
- |2
                      (denotation) in inverse relationship to their intension (comprehension): by
- |2
                      starting from general and vague ideas, one should end up with more
- |2
                      specific and clearer ideas. This dichotomy and progres- sive division of each idea into those ideas
- |2
                      immediately below it, is expounded in the Republic.
- |2
                      There is really a hierarchy made up of genus
- |2
                      (γένη) and species
- |2
                      (εἴδη), but for Plato, genus and
- |2
                      species are inseparable. Be- sides, Plato
- |2
                      applies the term mathemata
- |2
                      (μαθήματα)
- |2
                      not only to the exact sciences but also to the technical and mechanical
- |2
                      arts and to the liberal arts like music and gymnastics, that is to say, to
- |2
                      all the disciplines capable of educating a man. However, among thesemathemata Plato bestows a privileged place on the
- |2
                      sciences properly called mathematical. We must re-
- |2
                          member that geometry, arithmetic, astrology (in the463
- |2
                       sense of astronomy), and music belonged typically to Hellenic
- |2
                      culture. In the Laws, Plato returns to this question
- |2
                      in order to remind the reader that the first three sciences must be
- |2
                      acquired by every free man (Laws VII, 817E).
- |2
                  It was not until Aristotle that we find the separation between species and
- |2
                      genus, which was to become the basis of Aristotelian logic. The species is
- |2
                      the specifica- tion of the genus; both
- |2
                      appear in deduction, induction, and in the theory of definition (per genus proximum et differentiam specificam). We
- |2
                      find this hierarchy again in all the later types of classification,
- |2
                      however, the criterion of division by species and genus was later
- |2
                      shown to be inadequate; for example, according to the theory of evolution
- |2
                      zoological and botanical species have no stability. We must therefore take
- |2
                      into account other criteria: such as the contrasting criteria of objec- tivity and subjectivity, criteria
- |2
                      varying with respect to method, foundations, aims, and so forth. But,
- |2
                      returning to Aristotle, who is generally more systematic in his
- |2
                      ordering of the sciences, we note that for him there exist only three large
- |2
                      groups of sciences: (1) theoretical sciences (physics and philosophy); (2)
- |2
                      practical sciences (ethics and politics); (3) poetic sciences
- |2
                      (aesthetics). We also note that for him all reality is knowable only
- |2
                      through classification, but we must not forget also that for Aristotle all
- |2
                      sciences have to be subordinate to philosophy. It is true that Aristotle's
- |2
                          Physics comes exactly between mathematics and
- |2
                      theology and is pre- ceded by Logic, which is the structure of science and also the science of
- |2
                      structure. Physics is followed by Aristotle's
- |2
                      treatises On the Heavens (De
- |2
                      caelo), andMeterology. This plan is in conformity with the prin- ciples of classification which appear in
- |2
                      several places of his work. We note three in particular. In Aristotle'sTopics we read that science “is indeed called
- |2
                          specula- tive, practical, and poetic,
- |2
                      the differences depending on how each is related respectively to the
- |2
                      theory, the production, and the action of something” (Topics VI, 6, 145a 15). In the Nicomachean Ethics (VI, 3-5) there is a brief passage concerning
- |2
                      art (technē), science (epistemē), wisdom (phronēsis), philosophy (sophia), and
- |2
                      intelligence (nous). There are longer passages in theMetaphysics.
- |2
                  “Physics is the theoretical science of material objects in
- |2
                      motion...; mathematics is a contemplative sci-
- |2
                      ence, though certain mathematical entities are station- ary” (VI, 1026a). Then farther on:
- |2
                      “Theoretical sci- ences come before
- |2
                      the practical ones and philosophy before the theoretical sciences...;
- |2
                      motion exists only in relation to quantity, quality, and place”
- |2
                      (XI, 7 passim; XI, 12, 1068b).
- |2
                  Among Aristotle's pupils, Demetrius of Phalerum was a great encyclopedic
- |2
                      mind and one of the orga
- |2
                      nizers of the library in Alexandria, the center of scien- tists and philosophers. He deserves
- |2
                      mention here for having introduced divisions and subdivisions of knowl- edge with the aim of permitting
- |2
                      specialization in a given field of study. In the second century B.C.,
- |2
                      there was Posidonius of Apamea, the Stoic and polymath; he was later
- |2
                      in Rome and Cadiz; his work also included all fields of learning, though
- |2
                      unfortunately only some few fragments of his work are extant.
- |2
                  In the following century, in Rome, Marcus Terentius Varro expounded a whole
- |2
                      program of studies extending from grammar to architecture (Varro was contem- porary with Vitruvius), the program
- |2
                      answering certain practical needs without being devoid, however, of a
- |2
                      certain idealism. In Varro's Disciplinarum (ca. 50
- |2
                      B.C.), which may be regarded as the first illustrated encyclo- pedia, we find the following
- |2
                      classification: grammar, dialectic, rhetoric, geometry, arithmetic,
- |2
                      astrology, music, medicine, and architecture. It reflects perfectly
- |2
                      the genius of his time and especially of his people; it owes nothing, in
- |2
                      any case, to Aristotelian ideas. With respect to special disciplines,
- |2
                      mention must be made of the works of the physician A. Cornelius Celsus
- |2
                      and the Natural History of Pliny the Elder in 37
- |2
                      books, completed in A.D. 77, a true testament of ancient sci- ence and a model of classification within a
- |2
                      branch of science. Pliny's work has come down to us in its entirety.
- |2
                  We know that the Arabs preserved Creek science, that they translated the
- |2
                      works of the ancients, added commentaries, and not only left the imprint of
- |2
                      their genius on these commentaries, but made some original
- |2
                      contributions in every field of knowledge. Greek sci-
- |2
                          ence, enriched by the Arabs' contribution, was intro- duced by the Moors into Spain, and then proceeded
- |2
                      to penetrate other European countries. Within Islam there appeared during
- |2
                      the seventh century the first seeds of the new sciences which were
- |2
                      essentially reli- gious; then a distinction
- |2
                      was made between Arabic sciences (such as poetry and the art of oratory)
- |2
                      and foreign sciences (astronomy, medicine, mathematics). Most of the
- |2
                      “foreign sciences” came from the Greek heritage,
- |2
                      thanks to the Syrian translations; there were also works translated from
- |2
                      the Sanskrit via the Pali. A very distinct effort at classification is
- |2
                      discernible among the Arabs, for example, in Al Farabi and Avicenna
- |2
                      (Ibn Sina), an effort which had been preceded by the work of
- |2
                      systematization. To be remembered are the names of Djahiz ('Amr Ibn Bahr
- |2
                      Jahiz), an Iraquian scientist (died 868), author of a bestiary, or Book of Animals in seven volumes, in which we meet
- |2
                      subjects going beyond the scope of the title. His contemporary Ibn
- |2
                      Qutaibah wrote a treatise, Adab al Katib,
- |2
                      contain- ing an essay on classification (in
- |2
                      the introduction).

                  In China and in India throughout the centuries, there are examples of
- |2
                      classification in encyclopedic works. In China such works always enjoyed,
- |2
                      more than else- where, an important role in
- |2
                      education and in prepara- tion for taking
- |2
                      examinations for official positions. In the Han dynasty (second century
- |2
                      B.C.) appeared a dictionary entitled Erh-ya; it was
- |2
                      probably composed earlier. This work is divided into nineteen
- |2
                      categories: explanation of definitions, definitions of concepts, ex- planation of words, degrees of affinity;
- |2
                      then come the art of construction, tools, music, heaven, earth, hills,
- |2
                      mountains, water, fields, forests, insects, fish, birds, quadrupeds, and
- |2
                      domestic animals. Notice that this series is not devoid of a certain
- |2
                      structure. During the same period there also appeared a classification in
- |2
                      the dictionary of Liu Hsi (or Liu Hsieh), the Shih-ming or interpretation of concepts. The criterion applied
- |2
                      is the way of passing from heaven to earth and from earth to man; it
- |2
                      includes twenty-seven divisions. In the Ming era, which marked the first
- |2
                      commercial contacts with the Occident, the number of schools and
- |2
                      candidates taking examinations increased rapidly; in 1615, Mei
- |2
                      Ying-tsu published the Tzu-hui, a dictionary which
- |2
                      revolutionized the arrangement of words by ordering them on the basis of
- |2
                      graphic analogies. A century later, by taking the Tzu-hui as a model, a new dictionary was published, the K'ang-hsi tzu-tien, (dictionary of the era of
- |2
                      “splendid peace”) which serves as the basis of modern
- |2
                      Chinese encyclopedias.
- |2
                  In India, works embracing the whole of knowledge or bearing on a particular
- |2
                      field have been traditional since ancient times. The language used in the
- |2
                      beginning was nearly always Sanskrit. In the first centuries A.D.
- |2
                      there were the Dharmaśāstra
- |2
                      (Treatises of the Correct Order) in which there are ideas on cosmology,
- |2
                      social rules, human functions, and law. In the eleventh cen- tury, the encyclopedic work of the Sanskrit author
- |2
                      from Kashmir, Abinavagupta, and in the twelfth cen-
- |2
                          tury Somadeva's work on the arts and techniques are worthy of
- |2
                      notice. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, encyclopedic works
- |2
                      multiplied constantly, at first in Sanskrit, then in the majority of the
- |2
                      languages of India: Hindi (the government's language), Bengali,
- |2
                      Marath, Gujrāti, Tamil, Malayālam, Telugu, Kannada.
- |2
                  Returning to the Occident, more precisely to the medieval Christian
- |2
                      Occident, we find that for many centuries the regular study of the Quadrivium (arith-
- |2
                      metic, music, geometry, and astronomy) was a required preliminary to
- |2
                      the study of philosophy and theology. This rule, followed in Paris as well
- |2
                      as in Oxford, had been the practice in Constantinople where a new
- |2
                      branch of science was added to the list, namely, the art of
- |2
                      “horse-matters” or veterinary art. In Paris, among
- |2
                      the first masters of the Abbey of Saint-Victor,
- |2
                       which was one of the famous Parisian schools of the twelfth
- |2
                      century, was the important scholar, Hugh of Saint-Victor. His chief work,
- |2
                      the Didascalicon, contains a classification of the
- |2
                      sciences and is a typical example of the cultural level of the high Middle
- |2
                      Ages. The following are its main divisions, resulting from philos- ophy's encompassing all knowledge.
- |2
                      Philosophy is sub- divided into: (1)
- |2
                      theoretical sciences (mathematics, physics, theology); (2) practical
- |2
                      sciences (private or public); (3) mechanical sciences (navigation, agricul- ture, hunting, medicine, theater);
- |2
                      (4) logic, including grammar and rhetoric. There is obviously a
- |2
                      certain arbitrariness in the system proposed here, but nautical
- |2
                      knowledge emerges as a new branch of science. Fur-
- |2
                          thermore, cartography is soon to make its appearance—
- |2
                      well before the era of great sea voyages and discoveries. As for Hugh of
- |2
                      Saint-Victor, a curious mind and good pedagogue, he gave his readers the
- |2
                      following advice: learn everything, you will see later that nothing is
- |2
                      superfluous (omnia disce, videbis postea nihil esse
- |2
                          superfluum).
- |2
                  In the thirteenth century, we see how Roger Bacon, continuing the work of
- |2
                      Robert Grosseteste, placed mathematics at the base of the sciences of
- |2
                      nature. His classification contains four large classes: (1) grammar
- |2
                      and logic; (2) mathematics; (3) philosophy of nature; and (4) metaphysics
- |2
                      and ethics.
- |2
                  We must now observe that the essays on classification mentioned above,
- |2
                      though they provide us with a fairly faithful picture of the knowledge of
- |2
                      an era and in a given country, have yet failed to yield any
- |2
                      satisfactory connection among the scientific disciplines; they fail
- |2
                      even more to furnish a theory of knowledge internal to the sciences which
- |2
                      would enable us to take into account the great currents of thought in the
- |2
                      sciences. It was not until the time of the Renaissance, more
- |2
                      specifically, the end of the Renaissance, that a system of classification
- |2
                      appeared which for the first time is logical, organic, and firmly
- |2
                      structured with respect to aims, objects, and different groups of
- |2
                      phenomena. It was the system proposed by Francis Bacon in his work on
- |2
                      the worth and advancement of the sciences (De dignitate
- |2
                          et augmentis scientiarum). The author applied psychological
- |2
                      criteria, namely, Memory, Imagination, and Reason: history is constructed
- |2
                      by memory, and may be either Civil History or Natural History; poetry
- |2
                      flows from the fancy or imagination, and may be narrative, dramatic,
- |2
                      or parabolic; finally, philosophy, which re-
- |2
                      sults from the use of reason, is divided into the sciences of the
- |2
                      divine, of nature, and of man. The system of the classification of the
- |2
                      sciences and arts by Francis Bacon was adopted, with a few modifications,
- |2
                      by d'Alembert in the Discours préliminaire des
- |2
                          éditeurs de l'Encyclopédie.

- |2
                  Locke and Leibniz make a clear distinction between natural sciences (of
- |2
                      bodies and of the mind) and moral sciences (history and ethics). Locke
- |2
                      introduced Semi- otic or the science of
- |2
                      language, and Leibniz gave logic a preponderant place. From the eighteenth
- |2
                      century on, most philosophers and scientists who dealt with clas- sification divided the sciences into
- |2
                      two fundamental kinds: sciences of nature and sciences of the mind.
- |2
                  Towards the middle of the nineteenth century there appeared the system of
- |2
                      Auguste Comte, which is based on a series of decreasing generality and
- |2
                      increasing complexity of subject matter in the following order:
- |2
                      mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, sociology. The order
- |2
                      of the classes is inherently linear, and has several weak points. Comte
- |2
                      pictured in it a “natural logic” which has nothing to
- |2
                      do with the mod- ern idea of axiomatic logic. He
- |2
                      excluded the study of a spiritual or purely mental subject (it is true that
- |2
                      he later added morals and introspective data); he included among the
- |2
                      abstract sciences the concrete science of astronomy. His system was
- |2
                      reshaped by T. Whittaker who separated the two orders of objective
- |2
                      (physical) and subjective (psychological) sciences; unfortunately,
- |2
                      this separation fails to take account of the historical development of the
- |2
                      sciences.
- |2
                  It was the great physicist A. M. Ampère who pro- posed to make a comprehensive table of all the fields
- |2
                      of science. In his first table, Ampère separated all knowledge
- |2
                      into two domains and divided each domain into subdomains and branches; the
- |2
                      first domain com- prised the cosmological
- |2
                      sciences and the second the sciences of the mind. In his second table, each
- |2
                      branch is divided into sub-branches and into the primary sci- ences. In a third and final classification,
- |2
                      he divided each science of the first order into sciences of the second
- |2
                      and third orders, thus producing a sort of binary system which provided a
- |2
                      total of 27 = 128 names of disci- plines.
- |2
                      Ampère's system based on the content of the sciences, possesses a
- |2
                      very dynamic internal structure; it takes into account the historical
- |2
                      relations among different domains and it remains the most complete
- |2
                      inventory of scientific knowledge for the mid-
- |2
                          nineteenth century.
- |2
                  In 1851, A. A. Cournot worked out a system which introduced a separation
- |2
                      between structural laws and historical criteria in all their forms by
- |2
                      employing three great series of sciences, a theoretical, an historical,
- |2
                      and a practical series, each composed of the following kinds of
- |2
                      science: mathematical, physical, biological, mental or symbolical, and
- |2
                      political. Every branch of science has its place in one of the three times
- |2
                      five boxes in columns. This is clearly an advance on Comte's system in
- |2
                      particular, even though, here again, logic remains a difficult science to
- |2
                      place satisfactorily. (The question
- |2
                       can again be raised whether each science does not have its own
- |2
                      axiomatic structure or whether there might not be a common axiomatic
- |2
                      structure underlying all the sciences.)
- |2
                  Not long after Cournot, Herbert Spencer started from the assumption that all
- |2
                      knowledge varies with the object, and he classified the sciences according
- |2
                      to their degree of abstraction in relation to the object. He thus
- |2
                      obtained a linear series going from the abstract to the concrete, in which
- |2
                      series there is the following order of succession: the abstract sciences,
- |2
                      like logic and mathematics which are concerned with the form in which
- |2
                      phenomena appear; the abstract-concrete sci-
- |2
                      ences, like mechanics, physics, and chemistry which investigate the
- |2
                      causes of these phenomena; and, finally, the concrete sciences which are
- |2
                      interested only in results. There is a striking similarity between this
- |2
                          divi- sion and the one in the passage from
- |2
                      Aristotle's Topics quoted above.
- |2
                  It is in the Manuel du libraire et de l'amateur de
- |2
                          livres (“Bookseller's and Book-Lover's
- |2
                      Manual”) of Jacques-Charles Brunet, and exactly in the
- |2
                      introduction to Volume 6 (5th ed. 1865), that we find the first
- |2
                      insight into a historical classification. The author examines many
- |2
                      systems, including Konrad Gesner's, that of the Parisian publishers at the
- |2
                      time of the Revolution, and Ampère's.
- |2
                  Several German and British philosophers and scien-
- |2
                          tists dealt with the same problem of classification. Besides
- |2
                      Schopenhauer, who distinguished between empirical (a
- |2
                          posteriori) sciences and pure (a priori)
- |2
                      sciences, there were Hegel, Helmholtz, Wilhelm Dilthey, Hugo
- |2
                      Münsterberg, and later the psychologists Alfred Adler and Wilhelm
- |2
                      Wundt. Wundt drew a sharp contrast between the sciences of the real and
- |2
                      formal sciences. The chemist and Nobel laureate Wilhelm Ostwald
- |2
                      divided the sciences into formal, physical, and biological. Paul Tillich
- |2
                      considered three kinds: sciences of thought or the ideal, of being or the
- |2
                      real, and of the mind or normative sciences. Among the British
- |2
                      writers, classifications were made by Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill,
- |2
                      Karl Pearson, and Franklin H. Gid- dings. The
- |2
                      American scientist and philosopher Charles S. Peirce (son of the
- |2
                      mathematician and astronomer Benjamin Peirce) classified the sciences after
- |2
                          investi- gating and writing on logic,
- |2
                      psychology, mathematics, astronomy, optics, chemistry, and even
- |2
                      technology. Peirce emphasized methods of inquiry in two essays
- |2
                      “The Fixation of Belief” and “How To Make Our
- |2
                      Ideas Clear” (Popular Science Monthly,
- |2
                      1877-78), which mark the beginning of American pragmatism, though he
- |2
                      later preferred the term “pragmaticism” (as ex- plained in the article
- |2
                      “Pragmatism” in this Dictionary). Peirce's trichotomous classification placed Sciences of466
- |2
                       Discovery first, followed by Sciences of Review and Practical
- |2
                      Sciences in a descending order of importance. Sciences of Discovery
- |2
                      included Mathematics (of logic, of discrete series, of continua and
- |2
                      pseudo-continua), Philosophy (phenomenology, normative science, meta- physics), and Idioscopy (physical and
- |2
                      psychical sci- ences). Peirce had a low opinion
- |2
                      of Comte's and Spen- cer's attempts at
- |2
                      synthesis which fell under Sciences of Review, and had even a lower opinion
- |2
                      of the Practi- cal Sciences which included a
- |2
                      motley array of items such as etiquette, paper-making, wine tasting,
- |2

                  In 1920, Adrien Naville's Classification des
- |2
                      sciences appeared, based not on nomenclature, strictly
- |2
                      speaking, but on the leading ideas of the principal groups of sciences
- |2
                      and their interrelations. Naville separated three great classes of science:
- |2
                      Theorematics, science of laws; History, science of facts; and Canonics,
- |2
                      science of normative rules. These three classes provide answers to
- |2
                      three questions, respectively: What is possible? What is real? What is
- |2
                      good? To Naville the science of laws (nomology) is fundamental. A law is a
- |2
                          condi- tionally necessary
- |2
                      relationship; law exists wherever resemblance dominates the scene. Hence,
- |2
                      science must be concerned with general facts, thus recalling the
- |2
                      statement of Marcelin Berthelot (1827-1907) in the Preface to the Grande Encyclopédie (p. v): “The
- |2
                          classi- fication of general facts is
- |2
                      the classification of the sciences.”
- |2
                  In the first class considered by Naville, following nomology are
- |2
                      mathematics, physics, chemistry, somatic biology, psychology, and
- |2
                      sociology. Natural history, the theory of evolution, and human geography
- |2
                      belong to the second class. The sciences of normative rules are the
- |2
                      work of the arts and of everything concerned with the beautiful, the true,
- |2
                      and the useful for society as well as for the individual.
- |2
                  Among recent thinkers preoccupied with the prob-
- |2
                      lem of classification is the Soviet writer Bonifatii M. Kedrov whose
- |2
                      system is a closed, cyclical, and tight structure based on principles of
- |2
                      objectivity, subordi- nation, and
- |2
                      transition from lower to higher forms. The psychologist Jean Piaget has on
- |2
                      several occasions in- vestigated
- |2
                      classification, its history, and its importance for the theory of
- |2
                      knowledge. He has emphasized the increasing interpenetration of all the
- |2
                      branches of knowledge, the role of linguistic structuralism, and the
- |2
                      operational theory of intelligence. The system which he has proposed is not
- |2
                      circular or closed, and even less a linear one, but rather takes the form
- |2
                      of a con- stantly growing spiral. According
- |2
                      to Piaget, the subject-object opposition and dualism must be elimi- nated, for there is a constant
- |2
                      interaction and mutual exchange between the two.

                           The object is known only through actions of the subject and the
- |2
                              subject is known only through the relations it has to objects, from
- |2
                              which the twofold consequence is that in order to ground logic and
- |2
                              mathematics we must really go back in one form or another to the
- |2
                              subject, and in order to construct a science of the subject we must
- |2
                              go back to biology, hence also to physics and mathematics

- |2
                  Lately a leading role has been assigned to language, to its mathematical
- |2
                      structure, its axiomatic logic of grammatical categories, and to the logic
- |2
                      of binary relations in linguistics. The linguistic problem is tied to
- |2
                      the automatic (computerized) treatment of “infor- mation,” which is a matter of interest not
- |2
                      only to philologists, philosophers, and psychologists but equally as
- |2
                      much to mathematicians, cybernetic theo-
- |2
                      rists, and engineers. Logic, which has only with great difficulty
- |2
                      found its place in the classification of the sciences, is not the sole
- |2
                      basis of structural linguistics, for the latter depends on the psychology
- |2
                      of form (Gestalttheorie) and on topology and graphs.
- |2
                      Starting with language everything seems to converge on the unity of
- |2
                      knowledge. This advance towards unity should perhaps be, after all, the
- |2
                      primary aim of a new scien- tific humanism. A
- |2
                      classification of the sciences which is free from the subject-object
- |2
                      dualism and from an enslaving chainwork of values, and which takes
- |2
                      into account the profound, intimate, and reciprocal rela- tionships among all disciplines, would
- |2
                      be the only classification fit to instruct us about the present state
- |2
                      of our scientific knowledge.

               Dictionary of the History of IdeasThe aim of every classification is to establish order
- |2
                      in things and in thought. When this operation is applied in the
- |2
                      sciences at a given time in their evolution, it provides a faithful though
- |2
                      provisional picture of the scientific knowledge at that time. By enabling
- |2
                      us to take such an inventory of our knowledge, classification provides
- |2
                      a sort of spatiotemporal cross section of the sphere of ideas and culture
- |2
                      of a given period. The value
- |2
                       of classification, however, goes beyond a mere inven- tory or “table of contents,” no
- |2
                      matter how complete. The very fact that classification appeals to
- |2
                      logical criteria which may possibly be subjective or objective in
- |2
                      nature gives us an initial idea of the obstacles con- fronting the classifier, difficulties scarcely
- |2
                      encountered in the preparation of a catalogue, properly so called.
- |2
                      Consequently, a well conducted effort at surveying the history of the
- |2
                      classification of the sciences may be valuable in leading us to discover
- |2
                      the connections and analogies existing among the different fields of knowl- edge at a given time, and within the
- |2
                      context of a particular type of civilization. However, history of any
- |2
                      sort is not a static phenomenon, but follows an evolu- tionary course. We are obliged therefore to study
- |2
                      the sciences and their classification considered essentially as an
- |2
                      historical process subject to continuous develop-
- |2
                          ment. We shall thus see the appearance of the great currents of
- |2
                      ideas which have sometimes dominated many centuries and we can seek what is
- |2
                      less apparent, namely, the structure underlying these ideas.We can already discern among the ancients this need to classify and discover
- |2
                      relationships and hidden con- nections in
- |2
                      order to obtain a total view of reality and to explain the mechanism of the
- |2
                      universe. Take Pythagoras, for example, whose life was described by
- |2
                      Porphyry and Iamblichus, and whose teaching was addressed primarily to
- |2
                      those initiated in his circle. According to Pythagoras, geometry,
- |2
                      arithmetic (theory of numbers), and music (acoustics) lead to the
- |2
                      discovery of the secrets of number and harmony; only the sage by
- |2
                      starting with these principles is able to reconstruct reality (Stobaeus,
- |2
                          Florilège, I, 62-63). Through Archy- tas of Tarentum, Plato had been introduced
- |2
                      to the Pythagorean method, as can be seen in several places in the Timaeus, the Platonic dialogue on which Proclus
- |2
                      wrote a commentary in four books.Plato thought that ideas should be ordered according to their extension
- |2
                      (denotation) in inverse relationship to their intension (comprehension): by
- |2
                      starting from general and vague ideas, one should end up with more
- |2
                      specific and clearer ideas. This dichotomy and progres- sive division of each idea into those ideas
- |2
                      immediately below it, is expounded in the Republic.
- |2
                      There is really a hierarchy made up of genus
- |2
                      (γένη) and species
- |2
                      (εἴδη), but for Plato, genus and
- |2
                      species are inseparable. Be- sides, Plato
- |2
                      applies the term mathemata
- |2
                      (μαθήματα)
- |2
                      not only to the exact sciences but also to the technical and mechanical
- |2
                      arts and to the liberal arts like music and gymnastics, that is to say, to
- |2
                      all the disciplines capable of educating a man. However, among thesemathemata Plato bestows a privileged place on the
- |2
                      sciences properly called mathematical. We must re-
- |2
                          member that geometry, arithmetic, astrology (in theIt was not until Aristotle that we find the separation between species and
- |2
                      genus, which was to become the basis of Aristotelian logic. The species is
- |2
                      the specifica- tion of the genus; both
- |2
                      appear in deduction, induction, and in the theory of definition (per genus proximum et differentiam specificam). We
- |2
                      find this hierarchy again in all the later types of classification,
- |2
                      however, the criterion of division by species and genus was later
- |2
                      shown to be inadequate; for example, according to the theory of evolution
- |2
                      zoological and botanical species have no stability. We must therefore take

                      into account other criteria: such as the contrasting criteria of objec- tivity and subjectivity, criteria
- |2
                      varying with respect to method, foundations, aims, and so forth. But,
- |2
                      returning to Aristotle, who is generally more systematic in his
- |2
                      ordering of the sciences, we note that for him there exist only three large
- |2
                      groups of sciences: (1) theoretical sciences (physics and philosophy); (2)
- |2
                      practical sciences (ethics and politics); (3) poetic sciences
- |2
                      (aesthetics). We also note that for him all reality is knowable only
- |2
                      through classification, but we must not forget also that for Aristotle all
- |2
                      sciences have to be subordinate to philosophy. It is true that Aristotle's
- |2
                          Physics comes exactly between mathematics and
- |2
                      theology and is pre- ceded by Logic, which is the structure of science and also the science of
- |2
                      structure. Physics is followed by Aristotle's
- |2
                      treatises On the Heavens (De
- |2
                      caelo), andMeterology. This plan is in conformity with the prin- ciples of classification which appear in
- |2
                      several places of his work. We note three in particular. In Aristotle'sTopics we read that science “is indeed called
- |2
                          specula- tive, practical, and poetic,
- |2
                      the differences depending on how each is related respectively to the
- |2
                      theory, the production, and the action of something” (Topics VI, 6, 145a 15). In the Nicomachean Ethics (VI, 3-5) there is a brief passage concerning
- |2
                      art (technē), science (epistemē), wisdom (phronēsis), philosophy (sophia), and
- |2
                      intelligence (nous). There are longer passages in theMetaphysics.“Physics is the theoretical science of material objects in
- |2
                      motion...; mathematics is a contemplative sci-
- |2
                      ence, though certain mathematical entities are station- ary” (VI, 1026a). Then farther on:
- |2
                      “Theoretical sci- ences come before
- |2
                      the practical ones and philosophy before the theoretical sciences...;
- |2
                      motion exists only in relation to quantity, quality, and place”
- |2
                      (XI, 7 passim; XI, 12, 1068b).Among Aristotle's pupils, Demetrius of Phalerum was a great encyclopedic
- |2
                      mind and one of the orga
- |2
                      nizers of the library in Alexandria, the center of scien- tists and philosophers. He deserves
- |2
                      mention here for having introduced divisions and subdivisions of knowl- edge with the aim of permitting
- |2
                      specialization in a given field of study. In the second century B.C.,
- |2
                      there was Posidonius of Apamea, the Stoic and polymath; he was later
- |2
                      in Rome and Cadiz; his work also included all fields of learning, though
- |2
                      unfortunately only some few fragments of his work are extant.In the following century, in Rome, Marcus Terentius Varro expounded a whole
- |2
                      program of studies extending from grammar to architecture (Varro was contem- porary with Vitruvius), the program
- |2
                      answering certain practical needs without being devoid, however, of a
- |2
                      certain idealism. In Varro's Disciplinarum (ca. 50
- |2
                      B.C.), which may be regarded as the first illustrated encyclo- pedia, we find the following
- |2
                      classification: grammar, dialectic, rhetoric, geometry, arithmetic,
- |2
                      astrology, music, medicine, and architecture. It reflects perfectly
- |2
                      the genius of his time and especially of his people; it owes nothing, in
- |2
                      any case, to Aristotelian ideas. With respect to special disciplines,
- |2
                      mention must be made of the works of the physician A. Cornelius Celsus
- |2
                      and the Natural History of Pliny the Elder in 37
- |2
                      books, completed in A.D. 77, a true testament of ancient sci- ence and a model of classification within a
- |2
                      branch of science. Pliny's work has come down to us in its entirety.We know that the Arabs preserved Creek science, that they translated the
- |2
                      works of the ancients, added commentaries, and not only left the imprint of
- |2
                      their genius on these commentaries, but made some original
- |2
                      contributions in every field of knowledge. Greek sci-
- |2
                          ence, enriched by the Arabs' contribution, was intro- duced by the Moors into Spain, and then proceeded
- |2
                      to penetrate other European countries. Within Islam there appeared during
- |2
                      the seventh century the first seeds of the new sciences which were
- |2
                      essentially reli- gious; then a distinction
- |2
                      was made between Arabic sciences (such as poetry and the art of oratory)
- |2
                      and foreign sciences (astronomy, medicine, mathematics). Most of the
- |2
                      “foreign sciences” came from the Greek heritage,
- |2
                      thanks to the Syrian translations; there were also works translated from
- |2
                      the Sanskrit via the Pali. A very distinct effort at classification is
- |2
                      discernible among the Arabs, for example, in Al Farabi and Avicenna
- |2
                      (Ibn Sina), an effort which had been preceded by the work of
- |2
                      systematization. To be remembered are the names of Djahiz ('Amr Ibn Bahr
- |2
                      Jahiz), an Iraquian scientist (died 868), author of a bestiary, or Book of Animals in seven volumes, in which we meet
- |2
                      subjects going beyond the scope of the title. His contemporary Ibn
- |2
                      Qutaibah wrote a treatise, Adab al Katib,
- |2
                      contain- ing an essay on classification (in
- |2
                      the introduction).In China and in India throughout the centuries, there are examples of
- |2
                      classification in encyclopedic works. In China such works always enjoyed,
- |2
                      more than else- where, an important role in
- |2
                      education and in prepara- tion for taking
- |2
                      examinations for official positions. In the Han dynasty (second century
- |2
                      B.C.) appeared a dictionary entitled Erh-ya; it was
- |2
                      probably composed earlier. This work is divided into nineteen
- |2
                      categories: explanation of definitions, definitions of concepts, ex- planation of words, degrees of affinity;
- |2
                      then come the art of construction, tools, music, heaven, earth, hills,
- |2
                      mountains, water, fields, forests, insects, fish, birds, quadrupeds, and
- |2
                      domestic animals. Notice that this series is not devoid of a certain
- |2
                      structure. During the same period there also appeared a classification in
- |2
                      the dictionary of Liu Hsi (or Liu Hsieh), the Shih-ming or interpretation of concepts. The criterion applied
- |2
                      is the way of passing from heaven to earth and from earth to man; it
- |2
                      includes twenty-seven divisions. In the Ming era, which marked the first
- |2
                      commercial contacts with the Occident, the number of schools and
- |2
                      candidates taking examinations increased rapidly; in 1615, Mei
- |2
                      Ying-tsu published the Tzu-hui, a dictionary which
- |2
                      revolutionized the arrangement of words by ordering them on the basis of
- |2
                      graphic analogies. A century later, by taking the Tzu-hui as a model, a new dictionary was published, the K'ang-hsi tzu-tien, (dictionary of the era of
- |2
                      “splendid peace”) which serves as the basis of modern
- |2
                      Chinese encyclopedias.In India, works embracing the whole of knowledge or bearing on a particular
- |2
                      field have been traditional since ancient times. The language used in the
- |2
                      beginning was nearly always Sanskrit. In the first centuries A.D.
- |2
                      there were the Dharmaśāstra
- |2
                      (Treatises of the Correct Order) in which there are ideas on cosmology,
- |2
                      social rules, human functions, and law. In the eleventh cen- tury, the encyclopedic work of the Sanskrit author
- |2
                      from Kashmir, Abinavagupta, and in the twelfth cen-
- |2
                          tury Somadeva's work on the arts and techniques are worthy of
- |2
                      notice. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, encyclopedic works
- |2
                      multiplied constantly, at first in Sanskrit, then in the majority of the
- |2
                      languages of India: Hindi (the government's language), Bengali,
- |2
                      Marath, Gujrāti, Tamil, Malayālam, Telugu, Kannada.Returning to the Occident, more precisely to the medieval Christian
- |2
                      Occident, we find that for many centuries the regular study of the Quadrivium (arith-
- |2
                      metic, music, geometry, and astronomy) was a required preliminary to
- |2
                      the study of philosophy and theology. This rule, followed in Paris as well
- |2
                      as in Oxford, had been the practice in Constantinople where a new
- |2
                      branch of science was added to the list, namely, the art of
- |2
                      “horse-matters” or veterinary art. In Paris, among
- |2
                      the first masters of the Abbey of Saint-Victor,
- |2
                       which was one of the famous Parisian schools of the twelfth
- |2
                      century, was the important scholar, Hugh of Saint-Victor. His chief work,
- |2
                      the Didascalicon, contains a classification of the
- |2
                      sciences and is a typical example of the cultural level of the high Middle
- |2
                      Ages. The following are its main divisions, resulting from philos- ophy's encompassing all knowledge.
- |2
                      Philosophy is sub- divided into: (1)
- |2
                      theoretical sciences (mathematics, physics, theology); (2) practical
- |2
                      sciences (private or public); (3) mechanical sciences (navigation, agricul- ture, hunting, medicine, theater);
- |2
                      (4) logic, including grammar and rhetoric. There is obviously a
- |2
                      certain arbitrariness in the system proposed here, but nautical
- |2
                      knowledge emerges as a new branch of science. Fur-
- |2
                          thermore, cartography is soon to make its appearance—
- |2
                      well before the era of great sea voyages and discoveries. As for Hugh of
- |2
                      Saint-Victor, a curious mind and good pedagogue, he gave his readers the
- |2
                      following advice: learn everything, you will see later that nothing is
- |2
                      superfluous (omnia disce, videbis postea nihil esse
- |2
                          superfluum).In the thirteenth century, we see how Roger Bacon, continuing the work of
- |2
                      Robert Grosseteste, placed mathematics at the base of the sciences of
- |2
                      nature. His classification contains four large classes: (1) grammar
- |2
                      and logic; (2) mathematics; (3) philosophy of nature; and (4) metaphysics
- |2
                      and ethics.We must now observe that the essays on classification mentioned above,
- |2
                      though they provide us with a fairly faithful picture of the knowledge of
- |2
                      an era and in a given country, have yet failed to yield any
- |2
                      satisfactory connection among the scientific disciplines; they fail
- |2
                      even more to furnish a theory of knowledge internal to the sciences which
- |2
                      would enable us to take into account the great currents of thought in the
- |2
                      sciences. It was not until the time of the Renaissance, more
- |2
                      specifically, the end of the Renaissance, that a system of classification
- |2
                      appeared which for the first time is logical, organic, and firmly
- |2
                      structured with respect to aims, objects, and different groups of
- |2
                      phenomena. It was the system proposed by Francis Bacon in his work on
- |2
                      the worth and advancement of the sciences (De dignitate
- |2
                          et augmentis scientiarum). The author applied psychological
- |2
                      criteria, namely, Memory, Imagination, and Reason: history is constructed
- |2
                      by memory, and may be either Civil History or Natural History; poetry
- |2
                      flows from the fancy or imagination, and may be narrative, dramatic,
- |2
                      or parabolic; finally, philosophy, which re-
- |2
                      sults from the use of reason, is divided into the sciences of the
- |2
                      divine, of nature, and of man. The system of the classification of the
- |2
                      sciences and arts by Francis Bacon was adopted, with a few modifications,
- |2
                      by d'Alembert in the Discours préliminaire des
- |2
                          éditeurs de l'Encyclopédie.Locke and Leibniz make a clear distinction between natural sciences (of
- |2
                      bodies and of the mind) and moral sciences (history and ethics). Locke
- |2
                      introduced Semi- otic or the science of
- |2
                      language, and Leibniz gave logic a preponderant place. From the eighteenth
- |2
                      century on, most philosophers and scientists who dealt with clas- sification divided the sciences into
- |2
                      two fundamental kinds: sciences of nature and sciences of the mind.Towards the middle of the nineteenth century there appeared the system of
- |2
                      Auguste Comte, which is based on a series of decreasing generality and
- |2
                      increasing complexity of subject matter in the following order:
- |2
                      mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, sociology. The order
- |2
                      of the classes is inherently linear, and has several weak points. Comte
- |2
                      pictured in it a “natural logic” which has nothing to
- |2
                      do with the mod- ern idea of axiomatic logic. He
- |2
                      excluded the study of a spiritual or purely mental subject (it is true that
- |2
                      he later added morals and introspective data); he included among the
- |2
                      abstract sciences the concrete science of astronomy. His system was
- |2
                      reshaped by T. Whittaker who separated the two orders of objective
- |2
                      (physical) and subjective (psychological) sciences; unfortunately,
- |2
                      this separation fails to take account of the historical development of the
- |2
                      sciences.It was the great physicist A. M. Ampère who pro- posed to make a comprehensive table of all the fields
- |2
                      of science. In his first table, Ampère separated all knowledge
- |2
                      into two domains and divided each domain into subdomains and branches; the
- |2
                      first domain com- prised the cosmological
- |2
                      sciences and the second the sciences of the mind. In his second table, each
- |2
                      branch is divided into sub-branches and into the primary sci- ences. In a third and final classification,
- |2
                      he divided each science of the first order into sciences of the second
- |2
                      and third orders, thus producing a sort of binary system which provided a
- |2
                      total of 27 = 128 names of disci- plines.
- |2
                      Ampère's system based on the content of the sciences, possesses a
- |2
                      very dynamic internal structure; it takes into account the historical
- |2
                      relations among different domains and it remains the most complete
- |2
                      inventory of scientific knowledge for the mid-
- |2
                          nineteenth century.In 1851, A. A. Cournot worked out a system which introduced a separation
- |2
                      between structural laws and historical criteria in all their forms by
- |2
                      employing three great series of sciences, a theoretical, an historical,
- |2
                      and a practical series, each composed of the following kinds of
- |2
                      science: mathematical, physical, biological, mental or symbolical, and
- |2
                      political. Every branch of science has its place in one of the three times
- |2
                      five boxes in columns. This is clearly an advance on Comte's system in
- |2
                      particular, even though, here again, logic remains a difficult science to
- |2
                      place satisfactorily. (The question
- |2
                       can again be raised whether each science does not have its own
- |2
                      axiomatic structure or whether there might not be a common axiomatic

                      structure underlying all the sciences.)Not long after Cournot, Herbert Spencer started from the assumption that all
- |2
                      knowledge varies with the object, and he classified the sciences according
- |2
                      to their degree of abstraction in relation to the object. He thus
- |2
                      obtained a linear series going from the abstract to the concrete, in which
- |2
                      series there is the following order of succession: the abstract sciences,
- |2
                      like logic and mathematics which are concerned with the form in which
- |2
                      phenomena appear; the abstract-concrete sci-
- |2
                      ences, like mechanics, physics, and chemistry which investigate the
- |2
                      causes of these phenomena; and, finally, the concrete sciences which are
- |2
                      interested only in results. There is a striking similarity between this
- |2
                          divi- sion and the one in the passage from
- |2
                      Aristotle's Topics quoted above.It is in the Manuel du libraire et de l'amateur de
- |2
                          livres (“Bookseller's and Book-Lover's
- |2
                      Manual”) of Jacques-Charles Brunet, and exactly in the
- |2
                      introduction to Volume 6 (5th ed. 1865), that we find the first
- |2
                      insight into a historical classification. The author examines many
- |2
                      systems, including Konrad Gesner's, that of the Parisian publishers at the
- |2
                      time of the Revolution, and Ampère's.Several German and British philosophers and scien-
- |2
                          tists dealt with the same problem of classification. Besides
- |2
                      Schopenhauer, who distinguished between empirical (a
- |2
                          posteriori) sciences and pure (a priori)
- |2
                      sciences, there were Hegel, Helmholtz, Wilhelm Dilthey, Hugo
- |2
                      Münsterberg, and later the psychologists Alfred Adler and Wilhelm
- |2
                      Wundt. Wundt drew a sharp contrast between the sciences of the real and
- |2
                      formal sciences. The chemist and Nobel laureate Wilhelm Ostwald
- |2
                      divided the sciences into formal, physical, and biological. Paul Tillich
- |2
                      considered three kinds: sciences of thought or the ideal, of being or the
- |2
                      real, and of the mind or normative sciences. Among the British
- |2
                      writers, classifications were made by Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill,
- |2
                      Karl Pearson, and Franklin H. Gid- dings. The
- |2
                      American scientist and philosopher Charles S. Peirce (son of the
- |2
                      mathematician and astronomer Benjamin Peirce) classified the sciences after
- |2
                          investi- gating and writing on logic,
- |2
                      psychology, mathematics, astronomy, optics, chemistry, and even
- |2
                      technology. Peirce emphasized methods of inquiry in two essays
- |2
                      “The Fixation of Belief” and “How To Make Our
- |2
                      Ideas Clear” (Popular Science Monthly,
- |2
                      1877-78), which mark the beginning of American pragmatism, though he
- |2
                      later preferred the term “pragmaticism” (as ex- plained in the article
- |2
                      “Pragmatism” in this Dictionary). Peirce's trichotomous classification placed Sciences ofIn 1920, Adrien Naville's Classification des
- |2
                      sciences appeared, based not on nomenclature, strictly
- |2
                      speaking, but on the leading ideas of the principal groups of sciences
- |2
                      and their interrelations. Naville separated three great classes of science:
- |2
                      Theorematics, science of laws; History, science of facts; and Canonics,
- |2
                      science of normative rules. These three classes provide answers to
- |2
                      three questions, respectively: What is possible? What is real? What is
- |2
                      good? To Naville the science of laws (nomology) is fundamental. A law is a
- |2
                          condi- tionally necessary
- |2
                      relationship; law exists wherever resemblance dominates the scene. Hence,
- |2
                      science must be concerned with general facts, thus recalling the
- |2
                      statement of Marcelin Berthelot (1827-1907) in the Preface to the Grande Encyclopédie (p. v): “The
- |2
                          classi- fication of general facts is
- |2
                      the classification of the sciences.”In the first class considered by Naville, following nomology are
- |2
                      mathematics, physics, chemistry, somatic biology, psychology, and
- |2
                      sociology. Natural history, the theory of evolution, and human geography
- |2
                      belong to the second class. The sciences of normative rules are the
- |2
                      work of the arts and of everything concerned with the beautiful, the true,
- |2
                      and the useful for society as well as for the individual.Among recent thinkers preoccupied with the prob-
- |2
                      lem of classification is the Soviet writer Bonifatii M. Kedrov whose
- |2
                      system is a closed, cyclical, and tight structure based on principles of
- |2
                      objectivity, subordi- nation, and
- |2
                      transition from lower to higher forms. The psychologist Jean Piaget has on
- |2
                      several occasions in- vestigated
- |2
                      classification, its history, and its importance for the theory of
- |2
                      knowledge. He has emphasized the increasing interpenetration of all the
- |2
                      branches of knowledge, the role of linguistic structuralism, and the
- |2
                      operational theory of intelligence. The system which he has proposed is not
- |2
                      circular or closed, and even less a linear one, but rather takes the form
- |2
                      of a con- stantly growing spiral. According
- |2
                      to Piaget, the subject-object opposition and dualism must be elimi- nated, for there is a constant
- |2
                      interaction and mutual exchange between the two. The object is known only through actions of the subject and the
- |2
                              subject is known only through the relations it has to objects, from
- |2
                              which the twofold consequence is that in order to ground logic and
- |2
                              mathematics we must really go back in one form or another to the
- |2
                              subject, and in order to construct a science of the subject we must
- |2
                              go back to biology, hence also to physics and mathematics
- |2
                          (Piaget, p. 1159).
- |2
                      Lately a leading role has been assigned to language, to its mathematical
- |2
                      structure, its axiomatic logic of grammatical categories, and to the logic
- |2
                      of binary relations in linguistics. The linguistic problem is tied to
- |2
                      the automatic (computerized) treatment of “infor- mation,” which is a matter of interest not
- |2
                      only to philologists, philosophers, and psychologists but equally as
- |2
                      much to mathematicians, cybernetic theo-
- |2
                      rists, and engineers. Logic, which has only with great difficulty
- |2
                      found its place in the classification of the sciences, is not the sole
- |2
                      basis of structural linguistics, for the latter depends on the psychology
- |2
                      of form (Gestalttheorie) and on topology and graphs.
- |2
                      Starting with language everything seems to converge on the unity of
- |2
                      knowledge. This advance towards unity should perhaps be, after all, the
- |2
                      primary aim of a new scien- tific humanism. A
- |2
                      classification of the sciences which is free from the subject-object
- |2
                      dualism and from an enslaving chainwork of values, and which takes
- |2
                      into account the profound, intimate, and reciprocal rela- tionships among all disciplines, would
- |2
                      be the only classification fit to instruct us about the present state

                      of our scientific knowledge.A.-M. Ampère, Essai sur la philosophie des

  \               CLASSIFICATION OFTHE SCIENCES\n                The aim of every
  classification is to establish order\n                    in things and in thought.
  When this operation is applied in the\n                    sciences at a given time
  in their evolution, it provides a faithful though\n                    provisional
  picture of the scientific knowledge at that time. By enabling\n                    us
  to take such an inventory of our knowledge, classification provides\n                    a
  sort of spatiotemporal cross section of the sphere of ideas and culture\n                    of
  a given period. The value\n                     of classification, however, goes
  beyond a mere inven- tory or “table of contents,” no\n                    matter
  how complete. The very fact that classification appeals to\n                    logical
  criteria which may possibly be subjective or objective in\n                    nature
  gives us an initial idea of the obstacles con- fronting the classifier, difficulties
  scarcely\n                    encountered in the preparation of a catalogue, properly
  so called.\n                    Consequently, a well conducted effort at surveying
  the history of the\n                    classification of the sciences may be valuable
  in leading us to discover\n                    the connections and analogies existing
  among the different fields of knowl- edge at a given time, and within the\n                    context
  of a particular type of civilization. However, history of any\n                    sort
  is not a static phenomenon, but follows an evolu- tionary course. We are obliged
  therefore to study\n                    the sciences and their classification considered
  essentially as an\n                    historical process subject to continuous
  develop-\n                        ment. We shall thus see the appearance of the
  great currents of\n                    ideas which have sometimes dominated many
  centuries and we can seek what is\n                    less apparent, namely, the
  structure underlying these ideas.\n                We can already discern among
  the ancients this need to classify and discover\n                    relationships
  and hidden con- nections in\n                    order to obtain a total view of
  reality and to explain the mechanism of the\n                    universe. Take
  Pythagoras, for example, whose life was described by\n                    Porphyry
  and Iamblichus, and whose teaching was addressed primarily to\n                    those
  initiated in his circle. According to Pythagoras, geometry,\n                    arithmetic
  (theory of numbers), and music (acoustics) lead to the\n                    discovery
  of the secrets of number and harmony; only the sage by\n                    starting
  with these principles is able to reconstruct reality (Stobaeus,\n                        Florilège,
  I, 62-63). Through Archy- tas of Tarentum, Plato had been introduced\n                    to
  the Pythagorean method, as can be seen in several places in the Timaeus, the Platonic
  dialogue on which Proclus\n                    wrote a commentary in four books.\n
  \               Plato thought that ideas should be ordered according to their extension\n
  \                   (denotation) in inverse relationship to their intension (comprehension):
  by\n                    starting from general and vague ideas, one should end up
  with more\n                    specific and clearer ideas. This dichotomy and progres-
  sive division of each idea into those ideas\n                    immediately below
  it, is expounded in the Republic.\n                    There is really a hierarchy
  made up of genus\n                    (γένη) and species\n                    (εἴδη),
  but for Plato, genus and\n                    species are inseparable. Be- sides,
  Plato\n                    applies the term mathemata\n                    (μαθήματα)\n
  \                   not only to the exact sciences but also to the technical and
  mechanical\n                    arts and to the liberal arts like music and gymnastics,
  that is to say, to\n                    all the disciplines capable of educating
  a man. However, among thesemathemata Plato bestows a privileged place on the\n                    sciences
  properly called mathematical. We must re-\n                        member that geometry,
  arithmetic, astrology (in the463\n                     sense of astronomy), and
  music belonged typically to Hellenic\n                    culture. In the Laws,
  Plato returns to this question\n                    in order to remind the reader
  that the first three sciences must be\n                    acquired by every free
  man (Laws VII, 817E).\n                It was not until Aristotle that we find the
  separation between species and\n                    genus, which was to become the
  basis of Aristotelian logic. The species is\n                    the specifica-
  tion of the genus; both\n                    appear in deduction, induction, and
  in the theory of definition (per genus proximum et differentiam specificam). We\n
  \                   find this hierarchy again in all the later types of classification,\n
  \                   however, the criterion of division by species and genus was
  later\n                    shown to be inadequate; for example, according to the
  theory of evolution\n                    zoological and botanical species have no
  stability. We must therefore take\n                    into account other criteria:
  such as the contrasting criteria of objec- tivity and subjectivity, criteria\n                    varying
  with respect to method, foundations, aims, and so forth. But,\n                    returning
  to Aristotle, who is generally more systematic in his\n                    ordering
  of the sciences, we note that for him there exist only three large\n                    groups
  of sciences: (1) theoretical sciences (physics and philosophy); (2)\n                    practical
  sciences (ethics and politics); (3) poetic sciences\n                    (aesthetics).
  We also note that for him all reality is knowable only\n                    through
  classification, but we must not forget also that for Aristotle all\n                    sciences
  have to be subordinate to philosophy. It is true that Aristotle's\n                        Physics
  comes exactly between mathematics and\n                    theology and is pre-
  ceded by Logic, which is the structure of science and also the science of\n                    structure.
  Physics is followed by Aristotle's\n                    treatises On the Heavens
  (De\n                    caelo), andMeterology. This plan is in conformity with
  the prin- ciples of classification which appear in\n                    several
  places of his work. We note three in particular. In Aristotle'sTopics we read that
  science “is indeed called\n                        specula- tive, practical, and
  poetic,\n                    the differences depending on how each is related respectively
  to the\n                    theory, the production, and the action of something”
  (Topics VI, 6, 145a 15). In the Nicomachean Ethics (VI, 3-5) there is a brief passage
  concerning\n                    art (technē), science (epistemē), wisdom (phronēsis),
  philosophy (sophia), and\n                    intelligence (nous). There are longer
  passages in theMetaphysics.\n                “Physics is the theoretical science
  of material objects in\n                    motion...; mathematics is a contemplative
  sci-\n                    ence, though certain mathematical entities are station-
  ary” (VI, 1026a). Then farther on:\n                    “Theoretical sci- ences
  come before\n                    the practical ones and philosophy before the theoretical
  sciences...;\n                    motion exists only in relation to quantity, quality,
  and place”\n                    (XI, 7 passim; XI, 12, 1068b).\n                Among
  Aristotle's pupils, Demetrius of Phalerum was a great encyclopedic\n                    mind
  and one of the orga\n                    nizers of the library in Alexandria, the
  center of scien- tists and philosophers. He deserves\n                    mention
  here for having introduced divisions and subdivisions of knowl- edge with the aim
  of permitting\n                    specialization in a given field of study. In
  the second century B.C.,\n                    there was Posidonius of Apamea, the
  Stoic and polymath; he was later\n                    in Rome and Cadiz; his work
  also included all fields of learning, though\n                    unfortunately
  only some few fragments of his work are extant.\n                In the following
  century, in Rome, Marcus Terentius Varro expounded a whole\n                    program
  of studies extending from grammar to architecture (Varro was contem- porary with
  Vitruvius), the program\n                    answering certain practical needs without
  being devoid, however, of a\n                    certain idealism. In Varro's Disciplinarum
  (ca. 50\n                    B.C.), which may be regarded as the first illustrated
  encyclo- pedia, we find the following\n                    classification: grammar,
  dialectic, rhetoric, geometry, arithmetic,\n                    astrology, music,
  medicine, and architecture. It reflects perfectly\n                    the genius
  of his time and especially of his people; it owes nothing, in\n                    any
  case, to Aristotelian ideas. With respect to special disciplines,\n                    mention
  must be made of the works of the physician A. Cornelius Celsus\n                    and
  the Natural History of Pliny the Elder in 37\n                    books, completed
  in A.D. 77, a true testament of ancient sci- ence and a model of classification
  within a\n                    branch of science. Pliny's work has come down to us
  in its entirety.\n                We know that the Arabs preserved Creek science,
  that they translated the\n                    works of the ancients, added commentaries,
  and not only left the imprint of\n                    their genius on these commentaries,
  but made some original\n                    contributions in every field of knowledge.
  Greek sci-\n                        ence, enriched by the Arabs' contribution, was
  intro- duced by the Moors into Spain, and then proceeded\n                    to
  penetrate other European countries. Within Islam there appeared during\n                    the
  seventh century the first seeds of the new sciences which were\n                    essentially
  reli- gious; then a distinction\n                    was made between Arabic sciences
  (such as poetry and the art of oratory)\n                    and foreign sciences
  (astronomy, medicine, mathematics). Most of the\n                    “foreign sciences”
  came from the Greek heritage,\n                    thanks to the Syrian translations;
  there were also works translated from\n                    the Sanskrit via the
  Pali. A very distinct effort at classification is\n                    discernible
  among the Arabs, for example, in Al Farabi and Avicenna\n                    (Ibn
  Sina), an effort which had been preceded by the work of\n                    systematization.
  To be remembered are the names of Djahiz ('Amr Ibn Bahr\n                    Jahiz),
  an Iraquian scientist (died 868), author of a bestiary, or Book of Animals in seven
  volumes, in which we meet\n                    subjects going beyond the scope of
  the title. His contemporary Ibn\n                    Qutaibah wrote a treatise,
  Adab al Katib,\n                    contain- ing an essay on classification (in\n
  \                   the introduction).\n                464\n                \n
  \               In China and in India throughout the centuries, there are examples
  of\n                    classification in encyclopedic works. In China such works
  always enjoyed,\n                    more than else- where, an important role in\n
  \                   education and in prepara- tion for taking\n                    examinations
  for official positions. In the Han dynasty (second century\n                    B.C.)
  appeared a dictionary entitled Erh-ya; it was\n                    probably composed
  earlier. This work is divided into nineteen\n                    categories: explanation
  of definitions, definitions of concepts, ex- planation of words, degrees of affinity;\n
  \                   then come the art of construction, tools, music, heaven, earth,
  hills,\n                    mountains, water, fields, forests, insects, fish, birds,
  quadrupeds, and\n                    domestic animals. Notice that this series is
  not devoid of a certain\n                    structure. During the same period there
  also appeared a classification in\n                    the dictionary of Liu Hsi
  (or Liu Hsieh), the Shih-ming or interpretation of concepts. The criterion applied\n
  \                   is the way of passing from heaven to earth and from earth to
  man; it\n                    includes twenty-seven divisions. In the Ming era, which
  marked the first\n                    commercial contacts with the Occident, the
  number of schools and\n                    candidates taking examinations increased
  rapidly; in 1615, Mei\n                    Ying-tsu published the Tzu-hui, a dictionary
  which\n                    revolutionized the arrangement of words by ordering them
  on the basis of\n                    graphic analogies. A century later, by taking
  the Tzu-hui as a model, a new dictionary was published, the K'ang-hsi tzu-tien,
  (dictionary of the era of\n                    “splendid peace”) which serves as
  the basis of modern\n                    Chinese encyclopedias.\n                In
  India, works embracing the whole of knowledge or bearing on a particular\n                    field
  have been traditional since ancient times. The language used in the\n                    beginning
  was nearly always Sanskrit. In the first centuries A.D.\n                    there
  were the Dharmaśāstra\n                    (Treatises of the Correct Order) in which
  there are ideas on cosmology,\n                    social rules, human functions,
  and law. In the eleventh cen- tury, the encyclopedic work of the Sanskrit author\n
  \                   from Kashmir, Abinavagupta, and in the twelfth cen-\n                        tury
  Somadeva's work on the arts and techniques are worthy of\n                    notice.
  At the beginning of the nineteenth century, encyclopedic works\n                    multiplied
  constantly, at first in Sanskrit, then in the majority of the\n                    languages
  of India: Hindi (the government's language), Bengali,\n                    Marath,
  Gujrāti, Tamil, Malayālam, Telugu, Kannada.\n                Returning to the Occident,
  more precisely to the medieval Christian\n                    Occident, we find
  that for many centuries the regular study of the Quadrivium (arith-\n                    metic,
  music, geometry, and astronomy) was a required preliminary to\n                    the
  study of philosophy and theology. This rule, followed in Paris as well\n                    as
  in Oxford, had been the practice in Constantinople where a new\n                    branch
  of science was added to the list, namely, the art of\n                    “horse-matters”
  or veterinary art. In Paris, among\n                    the first masters of the
  Abbey of Saint-Victor,\n                     which was one of the famous Parisian
  schools of the twelfth\n                    century, was the important scholar,
  Hugh of Saint-Victor. His chief work,\n                    the Didascalicon, contains
  a classification of the\n                    sciences and is a typical example of
  the cultural level of the high Middle\n                    Ages. The following are
  its main divisions, resulting from philos- ophy's encompassing all knowledge.\n
  \                   Philosophy is sub- divided into: (1)\n                    theoretical
  sciences (mathematics, physics, theology); (2) practical\n                    sciences
  (private or public); (3) mechanical sciences (navigation, agricul- ture, hunting,
  medicine, theater);\n                    (4) logic, including grammar and rhetoric.
  There is obviously a\n                    certain arbitrariness in the system proposed
  here, but nautical\n                    knowledge emerges as a new branch of science.
  Fur-\n                        thermore, cartography is soon to make its appearance—\n
  \                   well before the era of great sea voyages and discoveries. As
  for Hugh of\n                    Saint-Victor, a curious mind and good pedagogue,
  he gave his readers the\n                    following advice: learn everything,
  you will see later that nothing is\n                    superfluous (omnia disce,
  videbis postea nihil esse\n                        superfluum).\n                In
  the thirteenth century, we see how Roger Bacon, continuing the work of\n                    Robert
  Grosseteste, placed mathematics at the base of the sciences of\n                    nature.
  His classification contains four large classes: (1) grammar\n                    and
  logic; (2) mathematics; (3) philosophy of nature; and (4) metaphysics\n                    and
  ethics.\n                We must now observe that the essays on classification mentioned
  above,\n                    though they provide us with a fairly faithful picture
  of the knowledge of\n                    an era and in a given country, have yet
  failed to yield any\n                    satisfactory connection among the scientific
  disciplines; they fail\n                    even more to furnish a theory of knowledge
  internal to the sciences which\n                    would enable us to take into
  account the great currents of thought in the\n                    sciences. It was
  not until the time of the Renaissance, more\n                    specifically, the
  end of the Renaissance, that a system of classification\n                    appeared
  which for the first time is logical, organic, and firmly\n                    structured
  with respect to aims, objects, and different groups of\n                    phenomena.
  It was the system proposed by Francis Bacon in his work on\n                    the
  worth and advancement of the sciences (De dignitate\n                        et
  augmentis scientiarum). The author applied psychological\n                    criteria,
  namely, Memory, Imagination, and Reason: history is constructed\n                    by
  memory, and may be either Civil History or Natural History; poetry\n                    flows
  from the fancy or imagination, and may be narrative, dramatic,\n                    or
  parabolic; finally, philosophy, which re-\n                    sults from the use
  of reason, is divided into the sciences of the\n                    divine, of nature,
  and of man. The system of the classification of the\n                    sciences
  and arts by Francis Bacon was adopted, with a few modifications,\n                    by
  d'Alembert in the Discours préliminaire des\n                        éditeurs de
  l'Encyclopédie.\n                465\n                \n                Locke and
  Leibniz make a clear distinction between natural sciences (of\n                    bodies
  and of the mind) and moral sciences (history and ethics). Locke\n                    introduced
  Semi- otic or the science of\n                    language, and Leibniz gave logic
  a preponderant place. From the eighteenth\n                    century on, most
  philosophers and scientists who dealt with clas- sification divided the sciences
  into\n                    two fundamental kinds: sciences of nature and sciences
  of the mind.\n                Towards the middle of the nineteenth century there
  appeared the system of\n                    Auguste Comte, which is based on a series
  of decreasing generality and\n                    increasing complexity of subject
  matter in the following order:\n                    mathematics, astronomy, physics,
  chemistry, biology, sociology. The order\n                    of the classes is
  inherently linear, and has several weak points. Comte\n                    pictured
  in it a “natural logic” which has nothing to\n                    do with the mod-
  ern idea of axiomatic logic. He\n                    excluded the study of a spiritual
  or purely mental subject (it is true that\n                    he later added morals
  and introspective data); he included among the\n                    abstract sciences
  the concrete science of astronomy. His system was\n                    reshaped
  by T. Whittaker who separated the two orders of objective\n                    (physical)
  and subjective (psychological) sciences; unfortunately,\n                    this
  separation fails to take account of the historical development of the\n                    sciences.\n
  \               It was the great physicist A. M. Ampère who pro- posed to make a
  comprehensive table of all the fields\n                    of science. In his first
  table, Ampère separated all knowledge\n                    into two domains and
  divided each domain into subdomains and branches; the\n                    first
  domain com- prised the cosmological\n                    sciences and the second
  the sciences of the mind. In his second table, each\n                    branch
  is divided into sub-branches and into the primary sci- ences. In a third and final
  classification,\n                    he divided each science of the first order
  into sciences of the second\n                    and third orders, thus producing
  a sort of binary system which provided a\n                    total of 27 = 128
  names of disci- plines.\n                    Ampère's system based on the content
  of the sciences, possesses a\n                    very dynamic internal structure;
  it takes into account the historical\n                    relations among different
  domains and it remains the most complete\n                    inventory of scientific
  knowledge for the mid-\n                        nineteenth century.\n                In
  1851, A. A. Cournot worked out a system which introduced a separation\n                    between
  structural laws and historical criteria in all their forms by\n                    employing
  three great series of sciences, a theoretical, an historical,\n                    and
  a practical series, each composed of the following kinds of\n                    science:
  mathematical, physical, biological, mental or symbolical, and\n                    political.
  Every branch of science has its place in one of the three times\n                    five
  boxes in columns. This is clearly an advance on Comte's system in\n                    particular,
  even though, here again, logic remains a difficult science to\n                    place
  satisfactorily. (The question\n                     can again be raised whether
  each science does not have its own\n                    axiomatic structure or whether
  there might not be a common axiomatic\n                    structure underlying
  all the sciences.)\n                Not long after Cournot, Herbert Spencer started
  from the assumption that all\n                    knowledge varies with the object,
  and he classified the sciences according\n                    to their degree of
  abstraction in relation to the object. He thus\n                    obtained a linear
  series going from the abstract to the concrete, in which\n                    series
  there is the following order of succession: the abstract sciences,\n                    like
  logic and mathematics which are concerned with the form in which\n                    phenomena
  appear; the abstract-concrete sci-\n                    ences, like mechanics, physics,
  and chemistry which investigate the\n                    causes of these phenomena;
  and, finally, the concrete sciences which are\n                    interested only
  in results. There is a striking similarity between this\n                        divi-
  sion and the one in the passage from\n                    Aristotle's Topics quoted
  above.\n                It is in the Manuel du libraire et de l'amateur de\n                        livres
  (“Bookseller's and Book-Lover's\n                    Manual”) of Jacques-Charles
  Brunet, and exactly in the\n                    introduction to Volume 6 (5th ed.
  1865), that we find the first\n                    insight into a historical classification.
  The author examines many\n                    systems, including Konrad Gesner's,
  that of the Parisian publishers at the\n                    time of the Revolution,
  and Ampère's.\n                Several German and British philosophers and scien-\n
  \                       tists dealt with the same problem of classification. Besides\n
  \                   Schopenhauer, who distinguished between empirical (a\n                        posteriori)
  sciences and pure (a priori)\n                    sciences, there were Hegel, Helmholtz,
  Wilhelm Dilthey, Hugo\n                    Münsterberg, and later the psychologists
  Alfred Adler and Wilhelm\n                    Wundt. Wundt drew a sharp contrast
  between the sciences of the real and\n                    formal sciences. The chemist
  and Nobel laureate Wilhelm Ostwald\n                    divided the sciences into
  formal, physical, and biological. Paul Tillich\n                    considered three
  kinds: sciences of thought or the ideal, of being or the\n                    real,
  and of the mind or normative sciences. Among the British\n                    writers,
  classifications were made by Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill,\n                    Karl
  Pearson, and Franklin H. Gid- dings. The\n                    American scientist
  and philosopher Charles S. Peirce (son of the\n                    mathematician
  and astronomer Benjamin Peirce) classified the sciences after\n                        investi-
  gating and writing on logic,\n                    psychology, mathematics, astronomy,
  optics, chemistry, and even\n                    technology. Peirce emphasized methods
  of inquiry in two essays\n                    “The Fixation of Belief” and “How
  To Make Our\n                    Ideas Clear” (Popular Science Monthly,\n                    1877-78),
  which mark the beginning of American pragmatism, though he\n                    later
  preferred the term “pragmaticism” (as ex- plained in the article\n                    “Pragmatism”
  in this Dictionary). Peirce's trichotomous classification placed Sciences of466\n
  \                    Discovery first, followed by Sciences of Review and Practical\n
  \                   Sciences in a descending order of importance. Sciences of Discovery\n
  \                   included Mathematics (of logic, of discrete series, of continua
  and\n                    pseudo-continua), Philosophy (phenomenology, normative
  science, meta- physics), and Idioscopy (physical and\n                    psychical
  sci- ences). Peirce had a low opinion\n                    of Comte's and Spen-
  cer's attempts at\n                    synthesis which fell under Sciences of Review,
  and had even a lower opinion\n                    of the Practi- cal Sciences which
  included a\n                    motley array of items such as etiquette, paper-making,
  wine tasting,\n                    etc. (Peirce, I, 77-137).\n                In
  1920, Adrien Naville's Classification des\n                    sciences appeared,
  based not on nomenclature, strictly\n                    speaking, but on the leading
  ideas of the principal groups of sciences\n                    and their interrelations.
  Naville separated three great classes of science:\n                    Theorematics,
  science of laws; History, science of facts; and Canonics,\n                    science
  of normative rules. These three classes provide answers to\n                    three
  questions, respectively: What is possible? What is real? What is\n                    good?
  To Naville the science of laws (nomology) is fundamental. A law is a\n                        condi-
  tionally necessary\n                    relationship; law exists wherever resemblance
  dominates the scene. Hence,\n                    science must be concerned with
  general facts, thus recalling the\n                    statement of Marcelin Berthelot
  (1827-1907) in the Preface to the Grande Encyclopédie (p. v): “The\n                        classi-
  fication of general facts is\n                    the classification of the sciences.”\n
  \               In the first class considered by Naville, following nomology are\n
  \                   mathematics, physics, chemistry, somatic biology, psychology,
  and\n                    sociology. Natural history, the theory of evolution, and
  human geography\n                    belong to the second class. The sciences of
  normative rules are the\n                    work of the arts and of everything
  concerned with the beautiful, the true,\n                    and the useful for
  society as well as for the individual.\n                Among recent thinkers preoccupied
  with the prob-\n                    lem of classification is the Soviet writer Bonifatii
  M. Kedrov whose\n                    system is a closed, cyclical, and tight structure
  based on principles of\n                    objectivity, subordi- nation, and\n
  \                   transition from lower to higher forms. The psychologist Jean
  Piaget has on\n                    several occasions in- vestigated\n                    classification,
  its history, and its importance for the theory of\n                    knowledge.
  He has emphasized the increasing interpenetration of all the\n                    branches
  of knowledge, the role of linguistic structuralism, and the\n                    operational
  theory of intelligence. The system which he has proposed is not\n                    circular
  or closed, and even less a linear one, but rather takes the form\n                    of
  a con- stantly growing spiral. According\n                    to Piaget, the subject-object
  opposition and dualism must be elimi- nated, for there is a constant\n                    interaction
  and mutual exchange between the two.\n                \n                    \n                        \n
  \                        The object is known only through actions of the subject
  and the\n                            subject is known only through the relations
  it has to objects, from\n                            which the twofold consequence
  is that in order to ground logic and\n                            mathematics we
  must really go back in one form or another to the\n                            subject,
  and in order to construct a science of the subject we must\n                            go
  back to biology, hence also to physics and mathematics\n                    \n                    \n
  \                       (Piaget, p. 1159).\n                    \n                \n
  \               Lately a leading role has been assigned to language, to its mathematical\n
  \                   structure, its axiomatic logic of grammatical categories, and
  to the logic\n                    of binary relations in linguistics. The linguistic
  problem is tied to\n                    the automatic (computerized) treatment of
  “infor- mation,” which is a matter of interest not\n                    only to
  philologists, philosophers, and psychologists but equally as\n                    much
  to mathematicians, cybernetic theo-\n                    rists, and engineers. Logic,
  which has only with great difficulty\n                    found its place in the
  classification of the sciences, is not the sole\n                    basis of structural
  linguistics, for the latter depends on the psychology\n                    of form
  (Gestalttheorie) and on topology and graphs.\n                    Starting with
  language everything seems to converge on the unity of\n                    knowledge.
  This advance towards unity should perhaps be, after all, the\n                    primary
  aim of a new scien- tific humanism. A\n                    classification of the
  sciences which is free from the subject-object\n                    dualism and
  from an enslaving chainwork of values, and which takes\n                    into
  account the profound, intimate, and reciprocal rela- tionships among all disciplines,
  would\n                    be the only classification fit to instruct us about the
  present state\n                    of our scientific knowledge.\n                \n

  also Axiomatization; Classification of the Arts;\n                        Lin- guistics;

  History of IdeasThe aim of every classification is to establish order\n                    in
  things and in thought. When this operation is applied in the\n                    sciences
  at a given time in their evolution, it provides a faithful though\n                    provisional
  picture of the scientific knowledge at that time. By enabling\n                    us
  to take such an inventory of our knowledge, classification provides\n                    a
  sort of spatiotemporal cross section of the sphere of ideas and culture\n                    of
  a given period. The value\n                     of classification, however, goes
  beyond a mere inven- tory or “table of contents,” no\n                    matter
  how complete. The very fact that classification appeals to\n                    logical
  criteria which may possibly be subjective or objective in\n                    nature
  gives us an initial idea of the obstacles con- fronting the classifier, difficulties
  scarcely\n                    encountered in the preparation of a catalogue, properly
  so called.\n                    Consequently, a well conducted effort at surveying
  the history of the\n                    classification of the sciences may be valuable
  in leading us to discover\n                    the connections and analogies existing
  among the different fields of knowl- edge at a given time, and within the\n                    context
  of a particular type of civilization. However, history of any\n                    sort
  is not a static phenomenon, but follows an evolu- tionary course. We are obliged
  therefore to study\n                    the sciences and their classification considered
  essentially as an\n                    historical process subject to continuous
  develop-\n                        ment. We shall thus see the appearance of the
  great currents of\n                    ideas which have sometimes dominated many
  centuries and we can seek what is\n                    less apparent, namely, the
  structure underlying these ideas.We can already discern among the ancients this
  need to classify and discover\n                    relationships and hidden con-
  nections in\n                    order to obtain a total view of reality and to
  explain the mechanism of the\n                    universe. Take Pythagoras, for
  example, whose life was described by\n                    Porphyry and Iamblichus,
  and whose teaching was addressed primarily to\n                    those initiated
  in his circle. According to Pythagoras, geometry,\n                    arithmetic
  (theory of numbers), and music (acoustics) lead to the\n                    discovery
  of the secrets of number and harmony; only the sage by\n                    starting
  with these principles is able to reconstruct reality (Stobaeus,\n                        Florilège,
  I, 62-63). Through Archy- tas of Tarentum, Plato had been introduced\n                    to
  the Pythagorean method, as can be seen in several places in the Timaeus, the Platonic
  dialogue on which Proclus\n                    wrote a commentary in four books.Plato
  thought that ideas should be ordered according to their extension\n                    (denotation)
  in inverse relationship to their intension (comprehension): by\n                    starting
  from general and vague ideas, one should end up with more\n                    specific
  and clearer ideas. This dichotomy and progres- sive division of each idea into those
  ideas\n                    immediately below it, is expounded in the Republic.\n
  \                   There is really a hierarchy made up of genus\n                    (γένη)
  and species\n                    (εἴδη), but for Plato, genus and\n                    species
  are inseparable. Be- sides, Plato\n                    applies the term mathemata\n
  \                   (μαθήματα)\n                    not only to the exact sciences
  but also to the technical and mechanical\n                    arts and to the liberal
  arts like music and gymnastics, that is to say, to\n                    all the
  disciplines capable of educating a man. However, among thesemathemata Plato bestows
  a privileged place on the\n                    sciences properly called mathematical.
  We must re-\n                        member that geometry, arithmetic, astrology
  (in theIt was not until Aristotle that we find the separation between species and\n
  \                   genus, which was to become the basis of Aristotelian logic.
  The species is\n                    the specifica- tion of the genus; both\n                    appear
  in deduction, induction, and in the theory of definition (per genus proximum et
  differentiam specificam). We\n                    find this hierarchy again in all
  the later types of classification,\n                    however, the criterion of
  division by species and genus was later\n                    shown to be inadequate;
  for example, according to the theory of evolution\n                    zoological
  and botanical species have no stability. We must therefore take\n                    into
  account other criteria: such as the contrasting criteria of objec- tivity and subjectivity,
  criteria\n                    varying with respect to method, foundations, aims,
  and so forth. But,\n                    returning to Aristotle, who is generally
  more systematic in his\n                    ordering of the sciences, we note that
  for him there exist only three large\n                    groups of sciences: (1)
  theoretical sciences (physics and philosophy); (2)\n                    practical
  sciences (ethics and politics); (3) poetic sciences\n                    (aesthetics).
  We also note that for him all reality is knowable only\n                    through
  classification, but we must not forget also that for Aristotle all\n                    sciences
  have to be subordinate to philosophy. It is true that Aristotle's\n                        Physics
  comes exactly between mathematics and\n                    theology and is pre-
  ceded by Logic, which is the structure of science and also the science of\n                    structure.
  Physics is followed by Aristotle's\n                    treatises On the Heavens
  (De\n                    caelo), andMeterology. This plan is in conformity with
  the prin- ciples of classification which appear in\n                    several
  places of his work. We note three in particular. In Aristotle'sTopics we read that
  science “is indeed called\n                        specula- tive, practical, and
  poetic,\n                    the differences depending on how each is related respectively
  to the\n                    theory, the production, and the action of something”
  (Topics VI, 6, 145a 15). In the Nicomachean Ethics (VI, 3-5) there is a brief passage
  concerning\n                    art (technē), science (epistemē), wisdom (phronēsis),
  philosophy (sophia), and\n                    intelligence (nous). There are longer
  passages in theMetaphysics.“Physics is the theoretical science of material objects
  in\n                    motion...; mathematics is a contemplative sci-\n                    ence,
  though certain mathematical entities are station- ary” (VI, 1026a). Then farther
  on:\n                    “Theoretical sci- ences come before\n                    the
  practical ones and philosophy before the theoretical sciences...;\n                    motion
  exists only in relation to quantity, quality, and place”\n                    (XI,
  7 passim; XI, 12, 1068b).Among Aristotle's pupils, Demetrius of Phalerum was a great
  encyclopedic\n                    mind and one of the orga\n                    nizers
  of the library in Alexandria, the center of scien- tists and philosophers. He deserves\n
  \                   mention here for having introduced divisions and subdivisions
  of knowl- edge with the aim of permitting\n                    specialization in
  a given field of study. In the second century B.C.,\n                    there was
  Posidonius of Apamea, the Stoic and polymath; he was later\n                    in
  Rome and Cadiz; his work also included all fields of learning, though\n                    unfortunately
  only some few fragments of his work are extant.In the following century, in Rome,
  Marcus Terentius Varro expounded a whole\n                    program of studies
  extending from grammar to architecture (Varro was contem- porary with Vitruvius),
  the program\n                    answering certain practical needs without being
  devoid, however, of a\n                    certain idealism. In Varro's Disciplinarum
  (ca. 50\n                    B.C.), which may be regarded as the first illustrated
  encyclo- pedia, we find the following\n                    classification: grammar,
  dialectic, rhetoric, geometry, arithmetic,\n                    astrology, music,
  medicine, and architecture. It reflects perfectly\n                    the genius
  of his time and especially of his people; it owes nothing, in\n                    any
  case, to Aristotelian ideas. With respect to special disciplines,\n                    mention
  must be made of the works of the physician A. Cornelius Celsus\n                    and
  the Natural History of Pliny the Elder in 37\n                    books, completed
  in A.D. 77, a true testament of ancient sci- ence and a model of classification
  within a\n                    branch of science. Pliny's work has come down to us
  in its entirety.We know that the Arabs preserved Creek science, that they translated
  the\n                    works of the ancients, added commentaries, and not only
  left the imprint of\n                    their genius on these commentaries, but
  made some original\n                    contributions in every field of knowledge.
  Greek sci-\n                        ence, enriched by the Arabs' contribution, was
  intro- duced by the Moors into Spain, and then proceeded\n                    to
  penetrate other European countries. Within Islam there appeared during\n                    the
  seventh century the first seeds of the new sciences which were\n                    essentially
  reli- gious; then a distinction\n                    was made between Arabic sciences
  (such as poetry and the art of oratory)\n                    and foreign sciences
  (astronomy, medicine, mathematics). Most of the\n                    “foreign sciences”
  came from the Greek heritage,\n                    thanks to the Syrian translations;
  there were also works translated from\n                    the Sanskrit via the
  Pali. A very distinct effort at classification is\n                    discernible
  among the Arabs, for example, in Al Farabi and Avicenna\n                    (Ibn
  Sina), an effort which had been preceded by the work of\n                    systematization.
  To be remembered are the names of Djahiz ('Amr Ibn Bahr\n                    Jahiz),
  an Iraquian scientist (died 868), author of a bestiary, or Book of Animals in seven
  volumes, in which we meet\n                    subjects going beyond the scope of
  the title. His contemporary Ibn\n                    Qutaibah wrote a treatise,
  Adab al Katib,\n                    contain- ing an essay on classification (in\n
  \                   the introduction).In China and in India throughout the centuries,
  there are examples of\n                    classification in encyclopedic works.
  In China such works always enjoyed,\n                    more than else- where,
  an important role in\n                    education and in prepara- tion for taking\n
  \                   examinations for official positions. In the Han dynasty (second
  century\n                    B.C.) appeared a dictionary entitled Erh-ya; it was\n
  \                   probably composed earlier. This work is divided into nineteen\n
  \                   categories: explanation of definitions, definitions of concepts,
  ex- planation of words, degrees of affinity;\n                    then come the
  art of construction, tools, music, heaven, earth, hills,\n                    mountains,
  water, fields, forests, insects, fish, birds, quadrupeds, and\n                    domestic
  animals. Notice that this series is not devoid of a certain\n                    structure.
  During the same period there also appeared a classification in\n                    the
  dictionary of Liu Hsi (or Liu Hsieh), the Shih-ming or interpretation of concepts.
  The criterion applied\n                    is the way of passing from heaven to
  earth and from earth to man; it\n                    includes twenty-seven divisions.
  In the Ming era, which marked the first\n                    commercial contacts
  with the Occident, the number of schools and\n                    candidates taking
  examinations increased rapidly; in 1615, Mei\n                    Ying-tsu published
  the Tzu-hui, a dictionary which\n                    revolutionized the arrangement
  of words by ordering them on the basis of\n                    graphic analogies.
  A century later, by taking the Tzu-hui as a model, a new dictionary was published,
  the K'ang-hsi tzu-tien, (dictionary of the era of\n                    “splendid
  peace”) which serves as the basis of modern\n                    Chinese encyclopedias.In
  India, works embracing the whole of knowledge or bearing on a particular\n                    field
  have been traditional since ancient times. The language used in the\n                    beginning
  was nearly always Sanskrit. In the first centuries A.D.\n                    there
  were the Dharmaśāstra\n                    (Treatises of the Correct Order) in which
  there are ideas on cosmology,\n                    social rules, human functions,
  and law. In the eleventh cen- tury, the encyclopedic work of the Sanskrit author\n
  \                   from Kashmir, Abinavagupta, and in the twelfth cen-\n                        tury
  Somadeva's work on the arts and techniques are worthy of\n                    notice.
  At the beginning of the nineteenth century, encyclopedic works\n                    multiplied
  constantly, at first in Sanskrit, then in the majority of the\n                    languages
  of India: Hindi (the government's language), Bengali,\n                    Marath,
  Gujrāti, Tamil, Malayālam, Telugu, Kannada.Returning to the Occident, more precisely
  to the medieval Christian\n                    Occident, we find that for many centuries
  the regular study of the Quadrivium (arith-\n                    metic, music, geometry,
  and astronomy) was a required preliminary to\n                    the study of philosophy
  and theology. This rule, followed in Paris as well\n                    as in Oxford,
  had been the practice in Constantinople where a new\n                    branch
  of science was added to the list, namely, the art of\n                    “horse-matters”
  or veterinary art. In Paris, among\n                    the first masters of the
  Abbey of Saint-Victor,\n                     which was one of the famous Parisian
  schools of the twelfth\n                    century, was the important scholar,
  Hugh of Saint-Victor. His chief work,\n                    the Didascalicon, contains
  a classification of the\n                    sciences and is a typical example of
  the cultural level of the high Middle\n                    Ages. The following are
  its main divisions, resulting from philos- ophy's encompassing all knowledge.\n
  \                   Philosophy is sub- divided into: (1)\n                    theoretical
  sciences (mathematics, physics, theology); (2) practical\n                    sciences
  (private or public); (3) mechanical sciences (navigation, agricul- ture, hunting,
  medicine, theater);\n                    (4) logic, including grammar and rhetoric.
  There is obviously a\n                    certain arbitrariness in the system proposed
  here, but nautical\n                    knowledge emerges as a new branch of science.
  Fur-\n                        thermore, cartography is soon to make its appearance—\n
  \                   well before the era of great sea voyages and discoveries. As
  for Hugh of\n                    Saint-Victor, a curious mind and good pedagogue,
  he gave his readers the\n                    following advice: learn everything,
  you will see later that nothing is\n                    superfluous (omnia disce,
  videbis postea nihil esse\n                        superfluum).In the thirteenth
  century, we see how Roger Bacon, continuing the work of\n                    Robert
  Grosseteste, placed mathematics at the base of the sciences of\n                    nature.
  His classification contains four large classes: (1) grammar\n                    and
  logic; (2) mathematics; (3) philosophy of nature; and (4) metaphysics\n                    and
  ethics.We must now observe that the essays on classification mentioned above,\n
  \                   though they provide us with a fairly faithful picture of the
  knowledge of\n                    an era and in a given country, have yet failed
  to yield any\n                    satisfactory connection among the scientific disciplines;
  they fail\n                    even more to furnish a theory of knowledge internal
  to the sciences which\n                    would enable us to take into account
  the great currents of thought in the\n                    sciences. It was not until
  the time of the Renaissance, more\n                    specifically, the end of
  the Renaissance, that a system of classification\n                    appeared which
  for the first time is logical, organic, and firmly\n                    structured
  with respect to aims, objects, and different groups of\n                    phenomena.
  It was the system proposed by Francis Bacon in his work on\n                    the
  worth and advancement of the sciences (De dignitate\n                        et
  augmentis scientiarum). The author applied psychological\n                    criteria,
  namely, Memory, Imagination, and Reason: history is constructed\n                    by
  memory, and may be either Civil History or Natural History; poetry\n                    flows
  from the fancy or imagination, and may be narrative, dramatic,\n                    or
  parabolic; finally, philosophy, which re-\n                    sults from the use
  of reason, is divided into the sciences of the\n                    divine, of nature,
  and of man. The system of the classification of the\n                    sciences
  and arts by Francis Bacon was adopted, with a few modifications,\n                    by
  d'Alembert in the Discours préliminaire des\n                        éditeurs de
  l'Encyclopédie.Locke and Leibniz make a clear distinction between natural sciences
  (of\n                    bodies and of the mind) and moral sciences (history and
  ethics). Locke\n                    introduced Semi- otic or the science of\n                    language,
  and Leibniz gave logic a preponderant place. From the eighteenth\n                    century
  on, most philosophers and scientists who dealt with clas- sification divided the
  sciences into\n                    two fundamental kinds: sciences of nature and
  sciences of the mind.Towards the middle of the nineteenth century there appeared
  the system of\n                    Auguste Comte, which is based on a series of
  decreasing generality and\n                    increasing complexity of subject
  matter in the following order:\n                    mathematics, astronomy, physics,
  chemistry, biology, sociology. The order\n                    of the classes is
  inherently linear, and has several weak points. Comte\n                    pictured
  in it a “natural logic” which has nothing to\n                    do with the mod-
  ern idea of axiomatic logic. He\n                    excluded the study of a spiritual
  or purely mental subject (it is true that\n                    he later added morals
  and introspective data); he included among the\n                    abstract sciences
  the concrete science of astronomy. His system was\n                    reshaped
  by T. Whittaker who separated the two orders of objective\n                    (physical)
  and subjective (psychological) sciences; unfortunately,\n                    this
  separation fails to take account of the historical development of the\n                    sciences.It
  was the great physicist A. M. Ampère who pro- posed to make a comprehensive table
  of all the fields\n                    of science. In his first table, Ampère separated
  all knowledge\n                    into two domains and divided each domain into
  subdomains and branches; the\n                    first domain com- prised the cosmological\n
  \                   sciences and the second the sciences of the mind. In his second
  table, each\n                    branch is divided into sub-branches and into the
  primary sci- ences. In a third and final classification,\n                    he
  divided each science of the first order into sciences of the second\n                    and
  third orders, thus producing a sort of binary system which provided a\n                    total
  of 27 = 128 names of disci- plines.\n                    Ampère's system based on
  the content of the sciences, possesses a\n                    very dynamic internal
  structure; it takes into account the historical\n                    relations among
  different domains and it remains the most complete\n                    inventory
  of scientific knowledge for the mid-\n                        nineteenth century.In
  1851, A. A. Cournot worked out a system which introduced a separation\n                    between
  structural laws and historical criteria in all their forms by\n                    employing
  three great series of sciences, a theoretical, an historical,\n                    and
  a practical series, each composed of the following kinds of\n                    science:
  mathematical, physical, biological, mental or symbolical, and\n                    political.
  Every branch of science has its place in one of the three times\n                    five
  boxes in columns. This is clearly an advance on Comte's system in\n                    particular,
  even though, here again, logic remains a difficult science to\n                    place
  satisfactorily. (The question\n                     can again be raised whether
  each science does not have its own\n                    axiomatic structure or whether
  there might not be a common axiomatic\n                    structure underlying
  all the sciences.)Not long after Cournot, Herbert Spencer started from the assumption
  that all\n                    knowledge varies with the object, and he classified
  the sciences according\n                    to their degree of abstraction in relation
  to the object. He thus\n                    obtained a linear series going from
  the abstract to the concrete, in which\n                    series there is the
  following order of succession: the abstract sciences,\n                    like
  logic and mathematics which are concerned with the form in which\n                    phenomena
  appear; the abstract-concrete sci-\n                    ences, like mechanics, physics,
  and chemistry which investigate the\n                    causes of these phenomena;
  and, finally, the concrete sciences which are\n                    interested only
  in results. There is a striking similarity between this\n                        divi-
  sion and the one in the passage from\n                    Aristotle's Topics quoted
  above.It is in the Manuel du libraire et de l'amateur de\n                        livres
  (“Bookseller's and Book-Lover's\n                    Manual”) of Jacques-Charles
  Brunet, and exactly in the\n                    introduction to Volume 6 (5th ed.
  1865), that we find the first\n                    insight into a historical classification.
  The author examines many\n                    systems, including Konrad Gesner's,
  that of the Parisian publishers at the\n                    time of the Revolution,
  and Ampère's.Several German and British philosophers and scien-\n                        tists
  dealt with the same problem of classification. Besides\n                    Schopenhauer,
  who distinguished between empirical (a\n                        posteriori) sciences
  and pure (a priori)\n                    sciences, there were Hegel, Helmholtz,
  Wilhelm Dilthey, Hugo\n                    Münsterberg, and later the psychologists
  Alfred Adler and Wilhelm\n                    Wundt. Wundt drew a sharp contrast
  between the sciences of the real and\n                    formal sciences. The chemist
  and Nobel laureate Wilhelm Ostwald\n                    divided the sciences into
  formal, physical, and biological. Paul Tillich\n                    considered three
  kinds: sciences of thought or the ideal, of being or the\n                    real,
  and of the mind or normative sciences. Among the British\n                    writers,
  classifications were made by Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill,\n                    Karl
  Pearson, and Franklin H. Gid- dings. The\n                    American scientist
  and philosopher Charles S. Peirce (son of the\n                    mathematician
  and astronomer Benjamin Peirce) classified the sciences after\n                        investi-
  gating and writing on logic,\n                    psychology, mathematics, astronomy,
  optics, chemistry, and even\n                    technology. Peirce emphasized methods
  of inquiry in two essays\n                    “The Fixation of Belief” and “How
  To Make Our\n                    Ideas Clear” (Popular Science Monthly,\n                    1877-78),
  which mark the beginning of American pragmatism, though he\n                    later
  preferred the term “pragmaticism” (as ex- plained in the article\n                    “Pragmatism”
  in this Dictionary). Peirce's trichotomous classification placed Sciences ofIn 1920,
  Adrien Naville's Classification des\n                    sciences appeared, based
  not on nomenclature, strictly\n                    speaking, but on the leading
  ideas of the principal groups of sciences\n                    and their interrelations.
  Naville separated three great classes of science:\n                    Theorematics,
  science of laws; History, science of facts; and Canonics,\n                    science
  of normative rules. These three classes provide answers to\n                    three
  questions, respectively: What is possible? What is real? What is\n                    good?
  To Naville the science of laws (nomology) is fundamental. A law is a\n                        condi-
  tionally necessary\n                    relationship; law exists wherever resemblance
  dominates the scene. Hence,\n                    science must be concerned with
  general facts, thus recalling the\n                    statement of Marcelin Berthelot
  (1827-1907) in the Preface to the Grande Encyclopédie (p. v): “The\n                        classi-
  fication of general facts is\n                    the classification of the sciences.”In
  the first class considered by Naville, following nomology are\n                    mathematics,
  physics, chemistry, somatic biology, psychology, and\n                    sociology.
  Natural history, the theory of evolution, and human geography\n                    belong
  to the second class. The sciences of normative rules are the\n                    work
  of the arts and of everything concerned with the beautiful, the true,\n                    and
  the useful for society as well as for the individual.Among recent thinkers preoccupied
  with the prob-\n                    lem of classification is the Soviet writer Bonifatii
  M. Kedrov whose\n                    system is a closed, cyclical, and tight structure
  based on principles of\n                    objectivity, subordi- nation, and\n
  \                   transition from lower to higher forms. The psychologist Jean
  Piaget has on\n                    several occasions in- vestigated\n                    classification,
  its history, and its importance for the theory of\n                    knowledge.
  He has emphasized the increasing interpenetration of all the\n                    branches
  of knowledge, the role of linguistic structuralism, and the\n                    operational
  theory of intelligence. The system which he has proposed is not\n                    circular
  or closed, and even less a linear one, but rather takes the form\n                    of
  a con- stantly growing spiral. According\n                    to Piaget, the subject-object
  opposition and dualism must be elimi- nated, for there is a constant\n                    interaction
  and mutual exchange between the two. The object is known only through actions of
  the subject and the\n                            subject is known only through the
  relations it has to objects, from\n                            which the twofold
  consequence is that in order to ground logic and\n                            mathematics
  we must really go back in one form or another to the\n                            subject,
  and in order to construct a science of the subject we must\n                            go
  back to biology, hence also to physics and mathematics\n                        (Piaget,
  p. 1159).\n                    Lately a leading role has been assigned to language,
  to its mathematical\n                    structure, its axiomatic logic of grammatical
  categories, and to the logic\n                    of binary relations in linguistics.
  The linguistic problem is tied to\n                    the automatic (computerized)
  treatment of “infor- mation,” which is a matter of interest not\n                    only
  to philologists, philosophers, and psychologists but equally as\n                    much
  to mathematicians, cybernetic theo-\n                    rists, and engineers. Logic,
  which has only with great difficulty\n                    found its place in the
  classification of the sciences, is not the sole\n                    basis of structural
  linguistics, for the latter depends on the psychology\n                    of form
  (Gestalttheorie) and on topology and graphs.\n                    Starting with
  language everything seems to converge on the unity of\n                    knowledge.
  This advance towards unity should perhaps be, after all, the\n                    primary
  aim of a new scien- tific humanism. A\n                    classification of the
  sciences which is free from the subject-object\n                    dualism and
  from an enslaving chainwork of values, and which takes\n                    into
  account the profound, intimate, and reciprocal rela- tionships among all disciplines,
  would\n                    be the only classification fit to instruct us about the
  present state\n                    of our scientific knowledge.A.-M. Ampère, Essai
