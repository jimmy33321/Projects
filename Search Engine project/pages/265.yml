                  Analogy, in its broadest sense, comprehends any
- |2
                      mode of reasoning that depends on the suggestion or recog- nition of a relationship of similarity between two ob- jects or sets of objects. It includes not only
- |2
                      four-term proportional relationships of the type A:B::C:D (for which
- |2
                      the Greek term is
- |2
                      ἀναλογία),
- |2
                      but also both explicit and implicit comparisons, for example the use
- |2
                      of models
- |2
                      (παραδείγματα)
- |2
                      and of images
- |2
                      (εἰκόνεσ).
- |2
                      In early Greek thought analogies played a fundamental role in the
- |2
                      expression of cosmological doctrines, in the development of natural
- |2
                      science, and in ethical and political arguments.
- |2
                  The three most important types of images used in cosmological theories are
- |2
                      (1) political and social, (2) vitalist, and (3) technological, in which,
- |2
                      roughly speak- ing, the cosmos is conceived as
- |2
                      a state, as a living being, and as an artifact respectively.
- "                \n"
- |2
                          1. Political and Social Images.
- |2
                       The use of political and social concepts is widespread in
- |2
                      pre-Socratic cosmology. The idea of cosmic order as a balance of power
- |2
                      between equal opposed forces goes back to Anaximander, who describes the
- |2
                      relation between cer- tain cosmic factors in
- |2
                      legal terms: “They pay the pen- alty
- |2
                      and recompense to one another for their injustice according to the
- |2
                      assessment of time.” Heraclitus, on the other hand, stresses the
- |2
                      constant war and strife between opposites: “One must realize
- |2
                      that war is com- mon and justice is strife and
- |2
                      everything happens through strife and necessity” (frag. 80). But
- |2
                      both Parmenides in the Way of Seeming and
- |2
                      Empedocles in his poem On Nature revert to the idea
- |2
                      of a cosmic balance of power. In Empedocles, for example, Love and
- |2
                      Strife are equals: they gain the upper hand in the world in turn, and these
- |2
                      alternations are governed by a “broad oath,” that is,
- |2
                      by some sort of contract be- tween them.
- |2
                  Anaxagoras and Diogenes of Apollonia use a third type of political model,
- |2
                      ascribing supreme power to a single cosmic principle, and Plato similarly
- |2
                      attributes supreme power to Reason which governs and arranges all
- |2
                      things for the best. Superficially this last group of images resembles the
- |2
                      traditional descriptions of Zeus as supreme god; but there is this
- |2
                      fundamental differ- ence, that the
- |2
                      philosophers ascribe supreme power not to a capricious deity, but to the
- |2
                      principle of order and rationality itself, to Mind or Reason or, in the
- |2
                      case of Diogenes, to Air, thought of as the seat of intelligence.
- |2
                      These authoritarian images too, like the egalitarian ones of Anaximander
- |2
                      and Empedocles, serve to express the idea of cosmic order, although they do
- |2
                      so from061
- |2
                       a different point of view and with different associations.
- |2
                  All these philosophers describe the cosmos in terms of a concrete political
- |2
                      or social situation, whether of a balance of power and equality of rights,
- |2
                      or of constant war and aggression, or of benevolent, authoritarian
- |2
                      rule. Plato's antidemocratic, authoritarian political inclinations are
- |2
                      echoed in his descriptions of Reason as a supreme, benevolent cosmic ruler,
- |2
                      but the evi- dence concerning earlier
- |2
                      philosophers is too scanty to allow us to determine how closely their
- |2
                      cosmological images tallied with their particular political
- |2
                      ideologies. However, there are two ways in which their images may be
- |2
                      related to their historical and social back-
- |2
                      ground.
- |2
                  First, the development of the Greek city-state from about the seventh
- |2
                      century B.C. was accompanied by an increasing political awareness and a new
- |2
                      conception of political rights. In particular the framing of consti- tutions and the codification of laws
- |2
                      led to a much less arbitrary administration of justice than had been
- |2
                      the case in earlier periods. These changes had their coun- terparts in the political images used
- |2
                      by the cosmolo- gists; varied as those
- |2
                      images are, they have in common the notion that cosmological changes are
- |2
                      governed by rules that are independent of the caprice of individuals.
- |2
                      The development in the attitude towards justice in the city-state is
- |2
                      reflected in the development of Greek cosmology itself, since it was
- |2
                      largely by means of the ideas of law and justice that the pre-Socratic
- |2
                      thinkers expressed the notion that the changes affecting the primary
- |2
                      substances in the world are orderly and regu-
- |2
                      lated by immutable principles.
- |2
                  Secondly, the very variety of images and of the cosmological doctrines
- |2
                      themselves is significant. As in the political sphere the rise of the
- |2
                      city-state is accom- panied by a
- |2
                      proliferation of constitutional forms rang- ing
- |2
                      from extreme democracy to tyranny, the merits of each of which were much
- |2
                      debated, so similarly in the field of speculative thought the philosophers
- |2
                      felt free to reject earlier ideas and to attempt to resolve each
- |2
                      problem for themselves, and each new theory as it was advanced was
- |2
                      discussed and criticized openly.
- |2
                  It is difficult to decide how far any of the pre-
- |2
                          Socratics recognized an element of transference in applying
- |2
                      political and social conceptions to the cosmos. No philosopher before Plato
- |2
                      explicitly refers to his cosmological images as images
- |2
                      (εἰκόνεσ),
- |2
                      and yet it is unlikely that any of them simply failed to differentiate
- |2
                      at all between the realm of society and that of nature, the relations
- |2
                      between which had become, by the end of the fifth century at least, the
- |2
                      subject of heated controversy. Heraclitus, for instance, tacitly distin- guishes between human laws and the
- |2
                      divine law, while saying that the former depend on the latter, in frag.
- |2
                       114. Evidently he did not simply confuse human soci- ety and cosmic order. Yet law and justice applied to
- |2
                      the cosmos were no mere figures of speech, for order in the human sphere
- |2
                      was regularly conceived as part of the wider cosmic
- |2
                      order and as somehow derived from it.

- |2
                          2. Vitalist Images.
- |2
                       Most of the earlier pre-Socratic philosophers imagined that the
- |2
                      primary stuff out of which things are made or from which they
- |2
                      originate is not merely like something that is
- |2
                      alive, but is indeed instinct with life. This is
- |2
                      true of all three Milesian philosophers and of Heraclitus; when he
- |2
                      describes the world-order as an “ever-living” fire in
- |2
                      frag. 30, “ever-
- |2
                      living” is not simply a poetical equivalent for
- |2
                          “ever- lasting,”
- |2
                      for he held that fire is indeed the substance of which our own souls
- |2
                      consist. Later the Atomists too seem to have believed that the mass of
- |2
                      atoms from which worlds originate is instinct with life in the sense
- |2
                      that it is permeated by soul-atoms. Although Aristotle ridiculed the belief
- |2
                      that soul is intermingled in the whole universe, he himself held that the
- |2
                      heavenly bodies are alive, and indeed some of his general physi- cal theories, for example the doctrine of
- |2
                      potentiality and actuality, are much influenced by ideas which apply
- |2
                      primarily to the sphere of living things.
- |2
                  These and other vitalist beliefs affected the develop- ment of Greek cosmology in three main ways.
- |2
                      First, the earliest philosophers were “hylozoists”;
- |2
                      they as- sumed that the primary substance, being
- |2
                      alive, is in motion. The question of the origin or cause of move- ment only came to be recognized as a
- |2
                      problem after Parmenides had denied the possibility of change.
- |2
                  Secondly, vitalist notions are naturally very impor-
- |2
                          tant in accounts of how the world developed from an original,
- |2
                      undifferentiated state. Anaximander, for ex-
- |2
                      ample, pictured the world evolving from a seed that separated off
- |2
                      from the Boundless, and some of the Pythagoreans too thought that the One
- |2
                      from which the cosmos developed was composed of seed.
- |2
                  Thirdly, the structure of the cosmos was sometimes compared with that of man
- |2
                      and vice versa. The idea that the world is a living creature may underlie
- |2
                      the comparison that Anaximenes drew between the role of air in the
- |2
                      world and that of breath in man. But two of the Hippocratic treatises put
- |2
                      forward much more elaborate analogies between the microcosm and the
- |2
                      macrocosm. In De victu man's body is said to be
- |2
                      a copy of the world-whole, the stomach being compared with the sea and
- |2
                      so on. And De hebdomadibus suggests detailed
- |2
                      correspondences both between the substances in the body and those in the
- |2
                      universe—where the bones correspond to the stony core of the
- |2
                      earth, for example— and between the various parts of the body
- |2
                      and different geographical areas—where the Thracian Bosphorus is062
- |2
                       said to correspond to the feet, the Peloponnese to the head,
- |2
                      and so on. While Plato proposed no detailed analogy between the anatomy of
- |2
                      man and the structure of the universe, he stated unequivocally his
- |2
                      conviction that “this world is in truth a living creature,
- |2
                      endowed with soul and reason” (Timaeus
- |2
                      30b), and according to the Philebus (29b ff.) both
- |2
                      our body and our soul are derived from the body and the soul of the world- whole respectively.

                          3. Technological Images.
- |2
                       Several of the pre- Socratics use
- |2
                      the metaphor of steering in their cos-
- |2
                      mologies, but the first to employ a wide range of technological
- |2
                      images is Empedocles, and then both Plato and Aristotle use them
- |2
                      extensively in two con- texts, especially, (1)
- |2
                      to describe the role of a moving or efficient cause, and (2) to express the
- |2
                      idea of intelli- gent design in the cosmos.
- |2
                  In Empedocles' system everything is composed of the four
- |2
                      “roots,” earth, water, air, and fire, together with
- |2
                      Love and Strife, and in describing how complex substances and the organs in
- |2
                      the body come to be he assigns to Love the role of craftsman, the four
- |2
                      elements being the material on which it works. It would be
- |2
                      anachronistic to attribute a clear distinction between
- |2
                      “material” and “efficient” causes to
- |2
                      Empedocles; but it is in the descriptions of the craftsmanlike
- |2
                      activity of Love that he comes closest to treating it as a purely
- |2
                      efficient cause. Plato's Timaeus is the first Greek
- |2
                      text to describe the formation of the world as a whole as the work of
- |2
                      a Craftsman. In Plato the Demiurge takes over already existing matter and
- |2
                      imposes order on its disorderly movements, and his account of the
- |2
                      details of creation is full of images drawn from carpentry, weaving,
- |2
                      modelling, metallurgy, and agricultural tech-
- |2
                      nology. Aristotle's unmoved mover, unlike Plato's Craftsman, is only
- |2
                      a final, not an efficient cause; but Aristotle too believes that final
- |2
                      causes are at work in natural processes, and he uses comparisons drawn
- |2
                      from the arts and crafts extensively to illustrate this. Despite their
- |2
                      unconcealed contempt for the life led by merely human artisans, both Plato
- |2
                      and Aristotle found techno- logical
- |2
                      imagery indispensable for expressing their belief in the rational design of
- |2
                      the universe.

- |2
                  The history of early Greek cosmology is largely the history of the
- |2
                      interpretation of the cosmos in terms of various ideas derived from the
- |2
                      three fields of politics, biology, and technology. Aristotle, especially,
- |2
                      criticized many such ideas, as for example the belief that such
- |2
                      substances as air or fire are alive. Yet these three types of images
- |2
                      continued to be influential long after him. The Stoics, in particular, not
- |2
                      only represented the cosmos as a living creature and believed in the pur- poseful, craftsmanlike activity of Nature,
- |2
                      but also
- |2
                       described the world as a state governed by divine law, and
- |2
                      similar ideas had a long history in the Middle Ages and in the Renaissance.
- |2
                  Moreover while Greek cosmology owed many ideas to politics and biology,
- |2
                      Greek biological theories and political thought were similarly colored by
- |2
                      the use of images drawn from one another. For example, the twin ideas
- |2
                      that health depends on the equality of rights
- |2
                      (ἰσονομία)
- |2
                      of opposed powers in the body, and that disease results from the supreme
- |2
                      rule
- |2
                      (μοναρχία)
- |2
                      of one such power, go back to Alcmaeon and thereafter be- come commonplaces of Greek pathology and thera- peutics. Aristotle, too, compares the
- |2
                      living creature with a well-governed city, describing the heart as the
- |2
                      central seat of authority in the body (e.g., De motu
- |2
                          animalium 703a 29ff.).
- |2
                  Conversely Greek political theorists sometimes compare the state with a
- |2
                      living organism, and the influence of other biological and technological
- |2
                          analo- gies on Greek ethics is marked.
- |2
                      Here Plato provides the best examples. First he constructed an
- |2
                      elaborate analogy between the state and the individual in theRepublic, suggesting, for instance, that both may be
- |2
                      divided into three parts, one of which—the Guardians in the
- |2
                      state and reason in the soul—should be in overall control. A
- |2
                      second important analogy in Plato is that between justice and health. This
- |2
                      provides the main grounds for the two theses, (1) that the just man is
- |2
                      happier than the unjust, and (2) that once having done wrong, it is better
- |2
                      to suffer than to escape punish-
- |2
                      ment—for punishment is the “cure” for
- |2
                      injustice. And a third recurrent analogy is that between the
- |2
                      politician and the artist or craftsman, where Plato suggests that the
- |2
                      statesman must be an expert in politics in a way comparable with that in
- |2
                      which a pilot is expert in navigation or a doctor in medicine. We find
- |2
                      similar types of analogies in Aristotle, too. In the Politics (1295a 40f.) he describes the constitution as the life,
- |2
                      as it were, of the state, and in the Nicomachean
- |2
                      Ethics (1113a 25ff.) he draws a comparison between the good man
- |2
                      and the healthy: just as a sick person may be mistaken about what is hot or
- |2
                      cold or sweet or bitter, and the judge of these things is the normal,
- |2
                      healthy man, so, he argues, the good man (ὁ
- |2
                      σπουδαῖος)
- |2
                      is the judge of what is right and wrong.
- |2
                  Greek ideas on nature and art, on the state, the living organism, and the
- |2
                      world as a whole, are linked by a series of interlocking analogies. Most of
- |2
                      the major fifth- and fourth-century
- |2
                      philosophers put forward analogies of one or other of the types we have
- |2
                      considered. Yet the particular forms that their analogies take are
- |2
                      very varied, and no single version of any of them dominates the
- |2
                      period. Had any such orthodoxy existed, these analogies might have impeded
- |2
                      the development of certain inquiries far more than they did. As it was,063
- |2
                       although some Hippocratic writers produced elaborate versions
- |2
                      of the microcosm-macrocosm analogy, this did not prevent other theorists
- |2
                      from making considerable progress in both the study of anatomy and in astron- omy, during the fourth century. Again,
- |2
                      both Plato and Aristotle held that the stars are alive and divine, al- though this had been denied by such thinkers
- |2
                      as Anaxagoras; yet this belief did not prevent Aristotle from
- |2
                      attempting a detailed mechanical account of the movements of the heavenly
- |2
                      bodies, based on Eudoxus' theory of concentric spheres.
- "                \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          III
- "                    \n"
- |2
                  Two other features of the role of analogy in early Greek thought that are
- |2
                      especially notable are (1) their use as a method of suggesting or
- |2
                      supporting explana- tions of particular
- |2
                      natural phenomena, and (2) the gradual exploration of the logic of analogy.
- |2
                      The begin- nings of the first use go back to
- |2
                      the Milesians, who based many of their accounts of obscure
- |2
                      astronomical, meteorological, and geological phenomena on simple
- |2
                      analogies with familiar objects. Thus Anaximenes compared lightning with
- |2
                      the flash made by an oar in water, believing both phenomena to be the
- |2
                      result of a cleaving process. His predecessor Anaximander sug- gested a more elaborate and artificial
- |2
                      analogy in which he pictured the heavenly bodies as wheels of fire
- |2
                      enclosed in mist; the stars themselves are seen through openings in the
- |2
                      mist, and he described eclipses of the sun and moon as being due to the
- |2
                      temporary blocking of their apertures. Primitive though this theory is,
- |2
                      it ranks as the first known attempt to construct a me- chanical model of the heavenly bodies.
- |2
                  The use of such comparisons grows as the range of problems investigated is
- |2
                      extended. Empedocles and some of the Hippocratic writers, especially,
- |2
                      propose ingenious analogies to explain processes that take place
- |2
                      within the body. Thus Empedocles compares the proc-
- |2
                      ess of respiration with the action of a clepsydra (water clock).
- |2
                          De natura pueri compares the formation of
- |2
                      a membrane round the seed in the womb with that of a crust on bread as
- |2
                      it is baked, and De morbis IV compares the
- |2
                      formation of stones in the bladder with the smelting of iron ore. The same
- |2
                      writer also illustrates how the humors travel between different parts of
- |2
                      the body by referring to the way in which a system of three or more
- |2
                      intercommunicating vessels may be filled with a liquid or emptied by
- |2
                      filling or emptying one of them, and on other occasions, too, Greek
- |2
                      scientists refer to simple tests carried out on substances outside the
- |2
                      body in their search for analogies for biological processes.
- |2
                  These writers rarely examine explicitly the question of how the analogies
- |2
                      they propose apply to the phe- nomena they
- |2
                      were supposed to explain, and many of
- |2
                       their ideas seem farfetched. Even so, analogy provided an
- |2
                      important, indeed in some cases the only, means of bringing empirical
- |2
                      evidence to bear on obscure or intractable problems, especially in such
- |2
                      fields as as- tronomy and meteorology,
- |2
                      embryology and pathology, where direct experimentation was generally out of
- |2
                      the question.
- |2
                  Various writers, beginning with Anaxagoras at the end of the fifth century,
- |2
                      refer to this use of analogy under the general heading of making
- |2
                      “phenomena the vision of things that are obscure”
- |2

- |2
                      and awareness of most of the different modes of analogy grows rapidly in
- |2
                      the fourth century. Plato, himself one of the chief exponents of
- |2
                      reasoning from analogy, was the first to point out how deceptive
- |2
                      similarities may be, and to draw attention to the differ- ence between merely probable arguments, including
- |2
                      emotive images and myths, and demonstrations. Then Aristotle analyzed
- |2
                      analogical argument as such in the form of the paradigm, explaining its
- |2
                      relation to induc- tion and showing that it is
- |2
                      not formally demonstrative. Nevertheless he granted its usefulness as a
- |2
                      persuasive argument in the field of rhetoric, and he even described
- |2
                      how a dialectician may exploit similarities in order to deceive an
- |2
                      opponent. Plato and Aristotle made decisive advances in exploring the logic
- |2
                      of arguments from analogy: yet the effect of their work was not, of
- |2
                      course, to preclude the use of such arguments, but rather to show that
- |2
                      they are not formally valid. Moreover while Aristotle successfully analyzed
- |2
                      analogy as a method of inference, neither he nor any later Greek logician
- |2
                      made much progress towards elucidating the other important function of
- |2
                      analogy, namely as a method of discovery in natural science.

- |2
                      mode of reasoning that depends on the suggestion or recog- nition of a relationship of similarity between two ob- jects or sets of objects. It includes not only
- |2
                      four-term proportional relationships of the type A:B::C:D (for which
- |2
                      the Greek term is
- |2
                      ἀναλογία),
- |2
                      but also both explicit and implicit comparisons, for example the use
- |2
                      of models
- |2
                      (παραδείγματα)
- |2
                      and of images
- |2
                      (εἰκόνεσ).
- |2
                      In early Greek thought analogies played a fundamental role in the
- |2
                      expression of cosmological doctrines, in the development of natural
- |2
                      science, and in ethical and political arguments.The three most important types of images used in cosmological theories are
- |2
                      (1) political and social, (2) vitalist, and (3) technological, in which,
- |2
                      roughly speak- ing, the cosmos is conceived as
- |2
                      a state, as a living being, and as an artifact respectively.
- |2
                          1. Political and Social Images.
- |2
                       The use of political and social concepts is widespread in
- |2
                      pre-Socratic cosmology. The idea of cosmic order as a balance of power
- |2
                      between equal opposed forces goes back to Anaximander, who describes the
- |2
                      relation between cer- tain cosmic factors in
- |2
                      legal terms: “They pay the pen- alty
- |2
                      and recompense to one another for their injustice according to the
- |2
                      assessment of time.” Heraclitus, on the other hand, stresses the
- |2
                      constant war and strife between opposites: “One must realize
- |2
                      that war is com- mon and justice is strife and
- |2
                      everything happens through strife and necessity” (frag. 80). But
- |2
                      both Parmenides in the Way of Seeming and
- |2
                      Empedocles in his poem On Nature revert to the idea
- |2
                      of a cosmic balance of power. In Empedocles, for example, Love and
- |2
                      Strife are equals: they gain the upper hand in the world in turn, and these
- |2
                      alternations are governed by a “broad oath,” that is,
- |2
                      by some sort of contract be- tween them.Anaxagoras and Diogenes of Apollonia use a third type of political model,
- |2
                      ascribing supreme power to a single cosmic principle, and Plato similarly
- |2
                      attributes supreme power to Reason which governs and arranges all
- |2
                      things for the best. Superficially this last group of images resembles the
- |2
                      traditional descriptions of Zeus as supreme god; but there is this
- |2
                      fundamental differ- ence, that the
- |2
                      philosophers ascribe supreme power not to a capricious deity, but to the
- |2
                      principle of order and rationality itself, to Mind or Reason or, in the
- |2
                      case of Diogenes, to Air, thought of as the seat of intelligence.
- |2
                      These authoritarian images too, like the egalitarian ones of Anaximander
- |2
                      and Empedocles, serve to express the idea of cosmic order, although they do
- |2
                      so fromAll these philosophers describe the cosmos in terms of a concrete political
- |2
                      or social situation, whether of a balance of power and equality of rights,
- |2
                      or of constant war and aggression, or of benevolent, authoritarian
- |2
                      rule. Plato's antidemocratic, authoritarian political inclinations are
- |2
                      echoed in his descriptions of Reason as a supreme, benevolent cosmic ruler,
- |2
                      but the evi- dence concerning earlier
- |2
                      philosophers is too scanty to allow us to determine how closely their
- |2
                      cosmological images tallied with their particular political
- |2
                      ideologies. However, there are two ways in which their images may be
- |2
                      related to their historical and social back-
- |2
                      ground.First, the development of the Greek city-state from about the seventh
- |2
                      century B.C. was accompanied by an increasing political awareness and a new
- |2
                      conception of political rights. In particular the framing of consti- tutions and the codification of laws
- |2
                      led to a much less arbitrary administration of justice than had been
- |2
                      the case in earlier periods. These changes had their coun- terparts in the political images used
- |2
                      by the cosmolo- gists; varied as those
- |2
                      images are, they have in common the notion that cosmological changes are
- |2
                      governed by rules that are independent of the caprice of individuals.
- |2
                      The development in the attitude towards justice in the city-state is
- |2
                      reflected in the development of Greek cosmology itself, since it was
- |2
                      largely by means of the ideas of law and justice that the pre-Socratic
- |2
                      thinkers expressed the notion that the changes affecting the primary
- |2
                      substances in the world are orderly and regu-
- |2
                      lated by immutable principles.Secondly, the very variety of images and of the cosmological doctrines
- |2
                      themselves is significant. As in the political sphere the rise of the
- |2
                      city-state is accom- panied by a
- |2
                      proliferation of constitutional forms rang- ing
- |2
                      from extreme democracy to tyranny, the merits of each of which were much
- |2
                      debated, so similarly in the field of speculative thought the philosophers
- |2
                      felt free to reject earlier ideas and to attempt to resolve each
- |2
                      problem for themselves, and each new theory as it was advanced was
- |2
                      discussed and criticized openly.It is difficult to decide how far any of the pre-
- |2
                          Socratics recognized an element of transference in applying
- |2
                      political and social conceptions to the cosmos. No philosopher before Plato
- |2
                      explicitly refers to his cosmological images as images
- |2
                      (εἰκόνεσ),
- |2
                      and yet it is unlikely that any of them simply failed to differentiate
- |2
                      at all between the realm of society and that of nature, the relations
- |2
                      between which had become, by the end of the fifth century at least, the
- |2
                      subject of heated controversy. Heraclitus, for instance, tacitly distin- guishes between human laws and the
- |2
                      divine law, while saying that the former depend on the latter, in frag.
- |2
                       114. Evidently he did not simply confuse human soci- ety and cosmic order. Yet law and justice applied to
- |2
                      the cosmos were no mere figures of speech, for order in the human sphere
- |2
                      was regularly conceived as part of the wider cosmic
- |2
                      order and as somehow derived from it.
- |2
                          2. Vitalist Images.
- |2
                       Most of the earlier pre-Socratic philosophers imagined that the
- |2
                      primary stuff out of which things are made or from which they
- |2
                      originate is not merely like something that is
- |2
                      alive, but is indeed instinct with life. This is
- |2
                      true of all three Milesian philosophers and of Heraclitus; when he
- |2
                      describes the world-order as an “ever-living” fire in
- |2
                      frag. 30, “ever-
- |2
                      living” is not simply a poetical equivalent for
- |2
                          “ever- lasting,”
- |2
                      for he held that fire is indeed the substance of which our own souls
- |2
                      consist. Later the Atomists too seem to have believed that the mass of
- |2
                      atoms from which worlds originate is instinct with life in the sense
- |2
                      that it is permeated by soul-atoms. Although Aristotle ridiculed the belief
- |2
                      that soul is intermingled in the whole universe, he himself held that the
- |2
                      heavenly bodies are alive, and indeed some of his general physi- cal theories, for example the doctrine of
- |2
                      potentiality and actuality, are much influenced by ideas which apply
- |2
                      primarily to the sphere of living things.These and other vitalist beliefs affected the develop- ment of Greek cosmology in three main ways.
- |2
                      First, the earliest philosophers were “hylozoists”;
- |2
                      they as- sumed that the primary substance, being
- |2
                      alive, is in motion. The question of the origin or cause of move- ment only came to be recognized as a
- |2
                      problem after Parmenides had denied the possibility of change.Secondly, vitalist notions are naturally very impor-
- |2
                          tant in accounts of how the world developed from an original,
- |2
                      undifferentiated state. Anaximander, for ex-
- |2
                      ample, pictured the world evolving from a seed that separated off
- |2
                      from the Boundless, and some of the Pythagoreans too thought that the One
- |2
                      from which the cosmos developed was composed of seed.Thirdly, the structure of the cosmos was sometimes compared with that of man
- |2
                      and vice versa. The idea that the world is a living creature may underlie
- |2
                      the comparison that Anaximenes drew between the role of air in the
- |2
                      world and that of breath in man. But two of the Hippocratic treatises put
- |2
                      forward much more elaborate analogies between the microcosm and the
- |2
                      macrocosm. In De victu man's body is said to be
- |2
                      a copy of the world-whole, the stomach being compared with the sea and
- |2
                      so on. And De hebdomadibus suggests detailed
- |2
                      correspondences both between the substances in the body and those in the
- |2
                      universe—where the bones correspond to the stony core of the
- |2
                      earth, for example— and between the various parts of the body
- |2
                      and different geographical areas—where the Thracian Bosphorus is
- |2
                          3. Technological Images.
- |2
                       Several of the pre- Socratics use
- |2
                      the metaphor of steering in their cos-
- |2
                      mologies, but the first to employ a wide range of technological
- |2
                      images is Empedocles, and then both Plato and Aristotle use them
- |2
                      extensively in two con- texts, especially, (1)
- |2
                      to describe the role of a moving or efficient cause, and (2) to express the
- |2
                      idea of intelli- gent design in the cosmos.In Empedocles' system everything is composed of the four
- |2
                      “roots,” earth, water, air, and fire, together with
- |2
                      Love and Strife, and in describing how complex substances and the organs in
- |2
                      the body come to be he assigns to Love the role of craftsman, the four
- |2
                      elements being the material on which it works. It would be
- |2
                      anachronistic to attribute a clear distinction between
- |2
                      “material” and “efficient” causes to
- |2
                      Empedocles; but it is in the descriptions of the craftsmanlike
- |2
                      activity of Love that he comes closest to treating it as a purely
- |2
                      efficient cause. Plato's Timaeus is the first Greek
- |2
                      text to describe the formation of the world as a whole as the work of
- |2
                      a Craftsman. In Plato the Demiurge takes over already existing matter and
- |2
                      imposes order on its disorderly movements, and his account of the
- |2
                      details of creation is full of images drawn from carpentry, weaving,
- |2
                      modelling, metallurgy, and agricultural tech-
- |2
                      nology. Aristotle's unmoved mover, unlike Plato's Craftsman, is only
- |2
                      a final, not an efficient cause; but Aristotle too believes that final
- |2
                      causes are at work in natural processes, and he uses comparisons drawn
- |2
                      from the arts and crafts extensively to illustrate this. Despite their
- |2
                      unconcealed contempt for the life led by merely human artisans, both Plato
- |2
                      and Aristotle found techno- logical
- |2
                      imagery indispensable for expressing their belief in the rational design of
- |2
                      the universe.The history of early Greek cosmology is largely the history of the
- |2
                      interpretation of the cosmos in terms of various ideas derived from the
- |2
                      three fields of politics, biology, and technology. Aristotle, especially,
- |2
                      criticized many such ideas, as for example the belief that such
- |2
                      substances as air or fire are alive. Yet these three types of images
- |2
                      continued to be influential long after him. The Stoics, in particular, not
- |2
                      only represented the cosmos as a living creature and believed in the pur- poseful, craftsmanlike activity of Nature,
- |2
                      but also
- |2
                       described the world as a state governed by divine law, and
- |2
                      similar ideas had a long history in the Middle Ages and in the Renaissance.Moreover while Greek cosmology owed many ideas to politics and biology,
- |2
                      Greek biological theories and political thought were similarly colored by
- |2
                      the use of images drawn from one another. For example, the twin ideas
- |2
                      that health depends on the equality of rights
- |2
                      (ἰσονομία)
- |2
                      of opposed powers in the body, and that disease results from the supreme
- |2
                      rule
- |2
                      (μοναρχία)
- |2
                      of one such power, go back to Alcmaeon and thereafter be- come commonplaces of Greek pathology and thera- peutics. Aristotle, too, compares the
- |2
                      living creature with a well-governed city, describing the heart as the
- |2
                      central seat of authority in the body (e.g., De motu
- |2
                          animalium 703a 29ff.).Conversely Greek political theorists sometimes compare the state with a
- |2
                      living organism, and the influence of other biological and technological
- |2
                          analo- gies on Greek ethics is marked.
- |2
                      Here Plato provides the best examples. First he constructed an
- |2
                      elaborate analogy between the state and the individual in theRepublic, suggesting, for instance, that both may be
- |2
                      divided into three parts, one of which—the Guardians in the
- |2
                      state and reason in the soul—should be in overall control. A
- |2
                      second important analogy in Plato is that between justice and health. This
- |2
                      provides the main grounds for the two theses, (1) that the just man is
- |2
                      happier than the unjust, and (2) that once having done wrong, it is better
- |2
                      to suffer than to escape punish-
- |2
                      ment—for punishment is the “cure” for
- |2
                      injustice. And a third recurrent analogy is that between the
- |2
                      politician and the artist or craftsman, where Plato suggests that the
- |2
                      statesman must be an expert in politics in a way comparable with that in
- |2
                      which a pilot is expert in navigation or a doctor in medicine. We find
- |2
                      similar types of analogies in Aristotle, too. In the Politics (1295a 40f.) he describes the constitution as the life,
- |2
                      as it were, of the state, and in the Nicomachean
- |2
                      Ethics (1113a 25ff.) he draws a comparison between the good man
- |2
                      and the healthy: just as a sick person may be mistaken about what is hot or
- |2
                      cold or sweet or bitter, and the judge of these things is the normal,
- |2
                      healthy man, so, he argues, the good man (ὁ
- |2
                      σπουδαῖος)
- |2
                      is the judge of what is right and wrong.Greek ideas on nature and art, on the state, the living organism, and the
- |2
                      world as a whole, are linked by a series of interlocking analogies. Most of
- |2
                      the major fifth- and fourth-century
- |2
                      philosophers put forward analogies of one or other of the types we have
- |2
                      considered. Yet the particular forms that their analogies take are
- |2
                      very varied, and no single version of any of them dominates the
- |2
                      period. Had any such orthodoxy existed, these analogies might have impeded
- |2
                      the development of certain inquiries far more than they did. As it was,Two other features of the role of analogy in early Greek thought that are
- |2
                      especially notable are (1) their use as a method of suggesting or
- |2
                      supporting explana- tions of particular
- |2
                      natural phenomena, and (2) the gradual exploration of the logic of analogy.
- |2
                      The begin- nings of the first use go back to
- |2
                      the Milesians, who based many of their accounts of obscure
- |2
                      astronomical, meteorological, and geological phenomena on simple
- |2
                      analogies with familiar objects. Thus Anaximenes compared lightning with
- |2
                      the flash made by an oar in water, believing both phenomena to be the
- |2
                      result of a cleaving process. His predecessor Anaximander sug- gested a more elaborate and artificial
- |2
                      analogy in which he pictured the heavenly bodies as wheels of fire
- |2
                      enclosed in mist; the stars themselves are seen through openings in the
- |2
                      mist, and he described eclipses of the sun and moon as being due to the
- |2
                      temporary blocking of their apertures. Primitive though this theory is,
- |2
                      it ranks as the first known attempt to construct a me- chanical model of the heavenly bodies.The use of such comparisons grows as the range of problems investigated is
- |2
                      extended. Empedocles and some of the Hippocratic writers, especially,
- |2
                      propose ingenious analogies to explain processes that take place
- |2
                      within the body. Thus Empedocles compares the proc-
- |2
                      ess of respiration with the action of a clepsydra (water clock).
- |2
                          De natura pueri compares the formation of
- |2
                      a membrane round the seed in the womb with that of a crust on bread as
- |2
                      it is baked, and De morbis IV compares the
- |2
                      formation of stones in the bladder with the smelting of iron ore. The same
- |2
                      writer also illustrates how the humors travel between different parts of
- |2
                      the body by referring to the way in which a system of three or more
- |2
                      intercommunicating vessels may be filled with a liquid or emptied by
- |2
                      filling or emptying one of them, and on other occasions, too, Greek
- |2
                      scientists refer to simple tests carried out on substances outside the
- |2
                      body in their search for analogies for biological processes.These writers rarely examine explicitly the question of how the analogies
- |2
                      they propose apply to the phe- nomena they
- |2
                      were supposed to explain, and many of
- |2
                       their ideas seem farfetched. Even so, analogy provided an
- |2
                      important, indeed in some cases the only, means of bringing empirical
- |2
                      evidence to bear on obscure or intractable problems, especially in such
- |2
                      fields as as- tronomy and meteorology,
- |2
                      embryology and pathology, where direct experimentation was generally out of
- |2
                      the question.Various writers, beginning with Anaxagoras at the end of the fifth century,
- |2
                      refer to this use of analogy under the general heading of making
- |2
                      “phenomena the vision of things that are obscure”
- |2
                      (ὄψισ

- |2
                      and awareness of most of the different modes of analogy grows rapidly in
- |2
                      the fourth century. Plato, himself one of the chief exponents of
- |2
                      reasoning from analogy, was the first to point out how deceptive
- |2
                      similarities may be, and to draw attention to the differ- ence between merely probable arguments, including
- |2
                      emotive images and myths, and demonstrations. Then Aristotle analyzed
- |2
                      analogical argument as such in the form of the paradigm, explaining its
- |2
                      relation to induc- tion and showing that it is
- |2
                      not formally demonstrative. Nevertheless he granted its usefulness as a
- |2
                      persuasive argument in the field of rhetoric, and he even described
- |2
                      how a dialectician may exploit similarities in order to deceive an
- |2
                      opponent. Plato and Aristotle made decisive advances in exploring the logic
- |2
                      of arguments from analogy: yet the effect of their work was not, of
- |2
                      course, to preclude the use of such arguments, but rather to show that
- |2
                      they are not formally valid. Moreover while Aristotle successfully analyzed
- |2
                      analogy as a method of inference, neither he nor any later Greek logician
- |2
                      made much progress towards elucidating the other important function of
- |2
                      analogy, namely as a method of discovery in natural science.The principal texts are discussed in G. E. R. Lloyd,Polarity and Analogy: two types of argumentation in
- |2
                              early Greek thought (Cambridge, 1966), which includes an exten- sive bibliography. See also

  \                ANALOGY INEARLY GREEK THOUGHT\n                \n                    \n
  \                       I\n                    \n                Analogy, in its
  broadest sense, comprehends any\n                    mode of reasoning that depends
  on the suggestion or recog- nition of a relationship of similarity between two ob-
  jects or sets of objects. It includes not only\n                    four-term proportional
  relationships of the type A:B::C:D (for which\n                    the Greek term
  is\n                    ἀναλογία),\n                    but also both explicit and
  implicit comparisons, for example the use\n                    of models\n                    (παραδείγματα)\n
  \                   and of images\n                    (εἰκόνεσ).\n                    In
  early Greek thought analogies played a fundamental role in the\n                    expression
  of cosmological doctrines, in the development of natural\n                    science,
  and in ethical and political arguments.\n                The three most important
  types of images used in cosmological theories are\n                    (1) political
  and social, (2) vitalist, and (3) technological, in which,\n                    roughly
  speak- ing, the cosmos is conceived as\n                    a state, as a living
  being, and as an artifact respectively.\n                \n                        1.
  Political and Social Images.\n                     The use of political and social
  concepts is widespread in\n                    pre-Socratic cosmology. The idea
  of cosmic order as a balance of power\n                    between equal opposed
  forces goes back to Anaximander, who describes the\n                    relation
  between cer- tain cosmic factors in\n                    legal terms: “They pay
  the pen- alty\n                    and recompense to one another for their injustice
  according to the\n                    assessment of time.” Heraclitus, on the other
  hand, stresses the\n                    constant war and strife between opposites:
  “One must realize\n                    that war is com- mon and justice is strife
  and\n                    everything happens through strife and necessity” (frag.
  80). But\n                    both Parmenides in the Way of Seeming and\n                    Empedocles
  in his poem On Nature revert to the idea\n                    of a cosmic balance
  of power. In Empedocles, for example, Love and\n                    Strife are equals:
  they gain the upper hand in the world in turn, and these\n                    alternations
  are governed by a “broad oath,” that is,\n                    by some sort of contract
  be- tween them.\n                Anaxagoras and Diogenes of Apollonia use a third
  type of political model,\n                    ascribing supreme power to a single
  cosmic principle, and Plato similarly\n                    attributes supreme power
  to Reason which governs and arranges all\n                    things for the best.
  Superficially this last group of images resembles the\n                    traditional
  descriptions of Zeus as supreme god; but there is this\n                    fundamental
  differ- ence, that the\n                    philosophers ascribe supreme power not
  to a capricious deity, but to the\n                    principle of order and rationality
  itself, to Mind or Reason or, in the\n                    case of Diogenes, to Air,
  thought of as the seat of intelligence.\n                    These authoritarian
  images too, like the egalitarian ones of Anaximander\n                    and Empedocles,
  serve to express the idea of cosmic order, although they do\n                    so
  from061\n                     a different point of view and with different associations.\n
  \               All these philosophers describe the cosmos in terms of a concrete
  political\n                    or social situation, whether of a balance of power
  and equality of rights,\n                    or of constant war and aggression,
  or of benevolent, authoritarian\n                    rule. Plato's antidemocratic,
  authoritarian political inclinations are\n                    echoed in his descriptions
  of Reason as a supreme, benevolent cosmic ruler,\n                    but the evi-
  dence concerning earlier\n                    philosophers is too scanty to allow
  us to determine how closely their\n                    cosmological images tallied
  with their particular political\n                    ideologies. However, there
  are two ways in which their images may be\n                    related to their
  historical and social back-\n                    ground.\n                First,
  the development of the Greek city-state from about the seventh\n                    century
  B.C. was accompanied by an increasing political awareness and a new\n                    conception
  of political rights. In particular the framing of consti- tutions and the codification
  of laws\n                    led to a much less arbitrary administration of justice
  than had been\n                    the case in earlier periods. These changes had
  their coun- terparts in the political images used\n                    by the cosmolo-
  gists; varied as those\n                    images are, they have in common the
  notion that cosmological changes are\n                    governed by rules that
  are independent of the caprice of individuals.\n                    The development
  in the attitude towards justice in the city-state is\n                    reflected
  in the development of Greek cosmology itself, since it was\n                    largely
  by means of the ideas of law and justice that the pre-Socratic\n                    thinkers
  expressed the notion that the changes affecting the primary\n                    substances
  in the world are orderly and regu-\n                    lated by immutable principles.\n
  \               Secondly, the very variety of images and of the cosmological doctrines\n
  \                   themselves is significant. As in the political sphere the rise
  of the\n                    city-state is accom- panied by a\n                    proliferation
  of constitutional forms rang- ing\n                    from extreme democracy to
  tyranny, the merits of each of which were much\n                    debated, so
  similarly in the field of speculative thought the philosophers\n                    felt
  free to reject earlier ideas and to attempt to resolve each\n                    problem
  for themselves, and each new theory as it was advanced was\n                    discussed
  and criticized openly.\n                It is difficult to decide how far any of
  the pre-\n                        Socratics recognized an element of transference
  in applying\n                    political and social conceptions to the cosmos.
  No philosopher before Plato\n                    explicitly refers to his cosmological
  images as images\n                    (εἰκόνεσ),\n                    and yet it
  is unlikely that any of them simply failed to differentiate\n                    at
  all between the realm of society and that of nature, the relations\n                    between
  which had become, by the end of the fifth century at least, the\n                    subject
  of heated controversy. Heraclitus, for instance, tacitly distin- guishes between
  human laws and the\n                    divine law, while saying that the former
  depend on the latter, in frag.\n                     114. Evidently he did not simply
  confuse human soci- ety and cosmic order. Yet law and justice applied to\n                    the
  cosmos were no mere figures of speech, for order in the human sphere\n                    was
  regularly conceived as part of the wider cosmic\n                    order and as
  somehow derived from it.\n                \n                        2. Vitalist
  Images.\n                     Most of the earlier pre-Socratic philosophers imagined
  that the\n                    primary stuff out of which things are made or from
  which they\n                    originate is not merely like something that is\n
  \                   alive, but is indeed instinct with life. This is\n                    true
  of all three Milesian philosophers and of Heraclitus; when he\n                    describes
  the world-order as an “ever-living” fire in\n                    frag. 30, “ever-\n
  \                   living” is not simply a poetical equivalent for\n                        “ever-
  lasting,”\n                    for he held that fire is indeed the substance of
  which our own souls\n                    consist. Later the Atomists too seem to
  have believed that the mass of\n                    atoms from which worlds originate
  is instinct with life in the sense\n                    that it is permeated by
  soul-atoms. Although Aristotle ridiculed the belief\n                    that soul
  is intermingled in the whole universe, he himself held that the\n                    heavenly
  bodies are alive, and indeed some of his general physi- cal theories, for example
  the doctrine of\n                    potentiality and actuality, are much influenced
  by ideas which apply\n                    primarily to the sphere of living things.\n
  \               These and other vitalist beliefs affected the develop- ment of Greek
  cosmology in three main ways.\n                    First, the earliest philosophers
  were “hylozoists”;\n                    they as- sumed that the primary substance,
  being\n                    alive, is in motion. The question of the origin or cause
  of move- ment only came to be recognized as a\n                    problem after
  Parmenides had denied the possibility of change.\n                Secondly, vitalist
  notions are naturally very impor-\n                        tant in accounts of how
  the world developed from an original,\n                    undifferentiated state.
  Anaximander, for ex-\n                    ample, pictured the world evolving from
  a seed that separated off\n                    from the Boundless, and some of the
  Pythagoreans too thought that the One\n                    from which the cosmos
  developed was composed of seed.\n                Thirdly, the structure of the cosmos
  was sometimes compared with that of man\n                    and vice versa. The
  idea that the world is a living creature may underlie\n                    the comparison
  that Anaximenes drew between the role of air in the\n                    world and
  that of breath in man. But two of the Hippocratic treatises put\n                    forward
  much more elaborate analogies between the microcosm and the\n                    macrocosm.
  In De victu man's body is said to be\n                    a copy of the world-whole,
  the stomach being compared with the sea and\n                    so on. And De hebdomadibus
  suggests detailed\n                    correspondences both between the substances
  in the body and those in the\n                    universe—where the bones correspond
  to the stony core of the\n                    earth, for example— and between the
  various parts of the body\n                    and different geographical areas—where
  the Thracian Bosphorus is062\n                     said to correspond to the feet,
  the Peloponnese to the head,\n                    and so on. While Plato proposed
  no detailed analogy between the anatomy of\n                    man and the structure
  of the universe, he stated unequivocally his\n                    conviction that
  “this world is in truth a living creature,\n                    endowed with soul
  and reason” (Timaeus\n                    30b), and according to the Philebus (29b
  ff.) both\n                    our body and our soul are derived from the body and
  the soul of the world- whole respectively.\n                \n                        3.
  Technological Images.\n                     Several of the pre- Socratics use\n
  \                   the metaphor of steering in their cos-\n                    mologies,
  but the first to employ a wide range of technological\n                    images
  is Empedocles, and then both Plato and Aristotle use them\n                    extensively
  in two con- texts, especially, (1)\n                    to describe the role of
  a moving or efficient cause, and (2) to express the\n                    idea of
  intelli- gent design in the cosmos.\n                In Empedocles' system everything
  is composed of the four\n                    “roots,” earth, water, air, and fire,
  together with\n                    Love and Strife, and in describing how complex
  substances and the organs in\n                    the body come to be he assigns
  to Love the role of craftsman, the four\n                    elements being the
  material on which it works. It would be\n                    anachronistic to attribute
  a clear distinction between\n                    “material” and “efficient” causes
  to\n                    Empedocles; but it is in the descriptions of the craftsmanlike\n
  \                   activity of Love that he comes closest to treating it as a purely\n
  \                   efficient cause. Plato's Timaeus is the first Greek\n                    text
  to describe the formation of the world as a whole as the work of\n                    a
  Craftsman. In Plato the Demiurge takes over already existing matter and\n                    imposes
  order on its disorderly movements, and his account of the\n                    details
  of creation is full of images drawn from carpentry, weaving,\n                    modelling,
  metallurgy, and agricultural tech-\n                    nology. Aristotle's unmoved
  mover, unlike Plato's Craftsman, is only\n                    a final, not an efficient
  cause; but Aristotle too believes that final\n                    causes are at
  work in natural processes, and he uses comparisons drawn\n                    from
  the arts and crafts extensively to illustrate this. Despite their\n                    unconcealed
  contempt for the life led by merely human artisans, both Plato\n                    and
  Aristotle found techno- logical\n                    imagery indispensable for expressing
  their belief in the rational design of\n                    the universe.\n                \n
  \                   \n                        II\n                    \n                The
  history of early Greek cosmology is largely the history of the\n                    interpretation
  of the cosmos in terms of various ideas derived from the\n                    three
  fields of politics, biology, and technology. Aristotle, especially,\n                    criticized
  many such ideas, as for example the belief that such\n                    substances
  as air or fire are alive. Yet these three types of images\n                    continued
  to be influential long after him. The Stoics, in particular, not\n                    only
  represented the cosmos as a living creature and believed in the pur- poseful, craftsmanlike
  activity of Nature,\n                    but also\n                     described
  the world as a state governed by divine law, and\n                    similar ideas
  had a long history in the Middle Ages and in the Renaissance.\n                Moreover
  while Greek cosmology owed many ideas to politics and biology,\n                    Greek
  biological theories and political thought were similarly colored by\n                    the
  use of images drawn from one another. For example, the twin ideas\n                    that
  health depends on the equality of rights\n                    (ἰσονομία)\n                    of
  opposed powers in the body, and that disease results from the supreme\n                    rule\n
  \                   (μοναρχία)\n                    of one such power, go back to
  Alcmaeon and thereafter be- come commonplaces of Greek pathology and thera- peutics.
  Aristotle, too, compares the\n                    living creature with a well-governed
  city, describing the heart as the\n                    central seat of authority
  in the body (e.g., De motu\n                        animalium 703a 29ff.).\n                Conversely
  Greek political theorists sometimes compare the state with a\n                    living
  organism, and the influence of other biological and technological\n                        analo-
  gies on Greek ethics is marked.\n                    Here Plato provides the best
  examples. First he constructed an\n                    elaborate analogy between
  the state and the individual in theRepublic, suggesting, for instance, that both
  may be\n                    divided into three parts, one of which—the Guardians
  in the\n                    state and reason in the soul—should be in overall control.
  A\n                    second important analogy in Plato is that between justice
  and health. This\n                    provides the main grounds for the two theses,
  (1) that the just man is\n                    happier than the unjust, and (2) that
  once having done wrong, it is better\n                    to suffer than to escape
  punish-\n                    ment—for punishment is the “cure” for\n                    injustice.
  And a third recurrent analogy is that between the\n                    politician
  and the artist or craftsman, where Plato suggests that the\n                    statesman
  must be an expert in politics in a way comparable with that in\n                    which
  a pilot is expert in navigation or a doctor in medicine. We find\n                    similar
  types of analogies in Aristotle, too. In the Politics (1295a 40f.) he describes
  the constitution as the life,\n                    as it were, of the state, and
  in the Nicomachean\n                    Ethics (1113a 25ff.) he draws a comparison
  between the good man\n                    and the healthy: just as a sick person
  may be mistaken about what is hot or\n                    cold or sweet or bitter,
  and the judge of these things is the normal,\n                    healthy man, so,
  he argues, the good man (ὁ\n                    σπουδαῖος)\n                    is
  the judge of what is right and wrong.\n                Greek ideas on nature and
  art, on the state, the living organism, and the\n                    world as a
  whole, are linked by a series of interlocking analogies. Most of\n                    the
  major fifth- and fourth-century\n                    philosophers put forward analogies
  of one or other of the types we have\n                    considered. Yet the particular
  forms that their analogies take are\n                    very varied, and no single
  version of any of them dominates the\n                    period. Had any such orthodoxy
  existed, these analogies might have impeded\n                    the development
  of certain inquiries far more than they did. As it was,063\n                     although
  some Hippocratic writers produced elaborate versions\n                    of the
  microcosm-macrocosm analogy, this did not prevent other theorists\n                    from
  making considerable progress in both the study of anatomy and in astron- omy, during
  the fourth century. Again,\n                    both Plato and Aristotle held that
  the stars are alive and divine, al- though this had been denied by such thinkers\n
  \                   as Anaxagoras; yet this belief did not prevent Aristotle from\n
  \                   attempting a detailed mechanical account of the movements of
  the heavenly\n                    bodies, based on Eudoxus' theory of concentric
  spheres.\n                \n                    \n                        III\n
  \                   \n                Two other features of the role of analogy
  in early Greek thought that are\n                    especially notable are (1)
  their use as a method of suggesting or\n                    supporting explana-
  tions of particular\n                    natural phenomena, and (2) the gradual
  exploration of the logic of analogy.\n                    The begin- nings of the
  first use go back to\n                    the Milesians, who based many of their
  accounts of obscure\n                    astronomical, meteorological, and geological
  phenomena on simple\n                    analogies with familiar objects. Thus Anaximenes
  compared lightning with\n                    the flash made by an oar in water,
  believing both phenomena to be the\n                    result of a cleaving process.
  His predecessor Anaximander sug- gested a more elaborate and artificial\n                    analogy
  in which he pictured the heavenly bodies as wheels of fire\n                    enclosed
  in mist; the stars themselves are seen through openings in the\n                    mist,
  and he described eclipses of the sun and moon as being due to the\n                    temporary
  blocking of their apertures. Primitive though this theory is,\n                    it
  ranks as the first known attempt to construct a me- chanical model of the heavenly
  bodies.\n                The use of such comparisons grows as the range of problems
  investigated is\n                    extended. Empedocles and some of the Hippocratic
  writers, especially,\n                    propose ingenious analogies to explain
  processes that take place\n                    within the body. Thus Empedocles
  compares the proc-\n                    ess of respiration with the action of a
  clepsydra (water clock).\n                        De natura pueri compares the formation
  of\n                    a membrane round the seed in the womb with that of a crust
  on bread as\n                    it is baked, and De morbis IV compares the\n                    formation
  of stones in the bladder with the smelting of iron ore. The same\n                    writer
  also illustrates how the humors travel between different parts of\n                    the
  body by referring to the way in which a system of three or more\n                    intercommunicating
  vessels may be filled with a liquid or emptied by\n                    filling or
  emptying one of them, and on other occasions, too, Greek\n                    scientists
  refer to simple tests carried out on substances outside the\n                    body
  in their search for analogies for biological processes.\n                These writers
  rarely examine explicitly the question of how the analogies\n                    they
  propose apply to the phe- nomena they\n                    were supposed to explain,
  and many of\n                     their ideas seem farfetched. Even so, analogy
  provided an\n                    important, indeed in some cases the only, means
  of bringing empirical\n                    evidence to bear on obscure or intractable
  problems, especially in such\n                    fields as as- tronomy and meteorology,\n
  \                   embryology and pathology, where direct experimentation was generally
  out of\n                    the question.\n                Various writers, beginning
  with Anaxagoras at the end of the fifth century,\n                    refer to this
  use of analogy under the general heading of making\n                    “phenomena
  the vision of things that are obscure”\n                    (ὄψισ\n                    τω̑ν\n
  \                   ἀδήλων\n                    τὰ\n                    φαινόμενα),\n
  \                   and awareness of most of the different modes of analogy grows
  rapidly in\n                    the fourth century. Plato, himself one of the chief
  exponents of\n                    reasoning from analogy, was the first to point
  out how deceptive\n                    similarities may be, and to draw attention
  to the differ- ence between merely probable arguments, including\n                    emotive
  images and myths, and demonstrations. Then Aristotle analyzed\n                    analogical
  argument as such in the form of the paradigm, explaining its\n                    relation
  to induc- tion and showing that it is\n                    not formally demonstrative.
  Nevertheless he granted its usefulness as a\n                    persuasive argument
  in the field of rhetoric, and he even described\n                    how a dialectician
  may exploit similarities in order to deceive an\n                    opponent. Plato
  and Aristotle made decisive advances in exploring the logic\n                    of
  arguments from analogy: yet the effect of their work was not, of\n                    course,
  to preclude the use of such arguments, but rather to show that\n                    they
  are not formally valid. Moreover while Aristotle successfully analyzed\n                    analogy
  as a method of inference, neither he nor any later Greek logician\n                    made
  much progress towards elucidating the other important function of\n                    analogy,
  namely as a method of discovery in natural science.\n                \n                    \n

  broadest sense, comprehends any\n                    mode of reasoning that depends
  on the suggestion or recog- nition of a relationship of similarity between two ob-
  jects or sets of objects. It includes not only\n                    four-term proportional
  relationships of the type A:B::C:D (for which\n                    the Greek term
  is\n                    ἀναλογία),\n                    but also both explicit and
  implicit comparisons, for example the use\n                    of models\n                    (παραδείγματα)\n
  \                   and of images\n                    (εἰκόνεσ).\n                    In
  early Greek thought analogies played a fundamental role in the\n                    expression
  of cosmological doctrines, in the development of natural\n                    science,
  and in ethical and political arguments.The three most important types of images
  used in cosmological theories are\n                    (1) political and social,
  (2) vitalist, and (3) technological, in which,\n                    roughly speak-
  ing, the cosmos is conceived as\n                    a state, as a living being,
  and as an artifact respectively.\n                        1. Political and Social
  Images.\n                     The use of political and social concepts is widespread
  in\n                    pre-Socratic cosmology. The idea of cosmic order as a balance
  of power\n                    between equal opposed forces goes back to Anaximander,
  who describes the\n                    relation between cer- tain cosmic factors
  in\n                    legal terms: “They pay the pen- alty\n                    and
  recompense to one another for their injustice according to the\n                    assessment
  of time.” Heraclitus, on the other hand, stresses the\n                    constant
  war and strife between opposites: “One must realize\n                    that war
  is com- mon and justice is strife and\n                    everything happens through
  strife and necessity” (frag. 80). But\n                    both Parmenides in the
  Way of Seeming and\n                    Empedocles in his poem On Nature revert
  to the idea\n                    of a cosmic balance of power. In Empedocles, for
  example, Love and\n                    Strife are equals: they gain the upper hand
  in the world in turn, and these\n                    alternations are governed by
  a “broad oath,” that is,\n                    by some sort of contract be- tween
  them.Anaxagoras and Diogenes of Apollonia use a third type of political model,\n
  \                   ascribing supreme power to a single cosmic principle, and Plato
  similarly\n                    attributes supreme power to Reason which governs
  and arranges all\n                    things for the best. Superficially this last
  group of images resembles the\n                    traditional descriptions of Zeus
  as supreme god; but there is this\n                    fundamental differ- ence,
  that the\n                    philosophers ascribe supreme power not to a capricious
  deity, but to the\n                    principle of order and rationality itself,
  to Mind or Reason or, in the\n                    case of Diogenes, to Air, thought
  of as the seat of intelligence.\n                    These authoritarian images
  too, like the egalitarian ones of Anaximander\n                    and Empedocles,
  serve to express the idea of cosmic order, although they do\n                    so
  fromAll these philosophers describe the cosmos in terms of a concrete political\n
  \                   or social situation, whether of a balance of power and equality
  of rights,\n                    or of constant war and aggression, or of benevolent,
  authoritarian\n                    rule. Plato's antidemocratic, authoritarian political
  inclinations are\n                    echoed in his descriptions of Reason as a
  supreme, benevolent cosmic ruler,\n                    but the evi- dence concerning
  earlier\n                    philosophers is too scanty to allow us to determine
  how closely their\n                    cosmological images tallied with their particular
  political\n                    ideologies. However, there are two ways in which
  their images may be\n                    related to their historical and social
  back-\n                    ground.First, the development of the Greek city-state
  from about the seventh\n                    century B.C. was accompanied by an increasing
  political awareness and a new\n                    conception of political rights.
  In particular the framing of consti- tutions and the codification of laws\n                    led
  to a much less arbitrary administration of justice than had been\n                    the
  case in earlier periods. These changes had their coun- terparts in the political
  images used\n                    by the cosmolo- gists; varied as those\n                    images
  are, they have in common the notion that cosmological changes are\n                    governed
  by rules that are independent of the caprice of individuals.\n                    The
  development in the attitude towards justice in the city-state is\n                    reflected
  in the development of Greek cosmology itself, since it was\n                    largely
  by means of the ideas of law and justice that the pre-Socratic\n                    thinkers
  expressed the notion that the changes affecting the primary\n                    substances
  in the world are orderly and regu-\n                    lated by immutable principles.Secondly,
  the very variety of images and of the cosmological doctrines\n                    themselves
  is significant. As in the political sphere the rise of the\n                    city-state
  is accom- panied by a\n                    proliferation of constitutional forms
  rang- ing\n                    from extreme democracy to tyranny, the merits of
  each of which were much\n                    debated, so similarly in the field
  of speculative thought the philosophers\n                    felt free to reject
  earlier ideas and to attempt to resolve each\n                    problem for themselves,
  and each new theory as it was advanced was\n                    discussed and criticized
  openly.It is difficult to decide how far any of the pre-\n                        Socratics
  recognized an element of transference in applying\n                    political
  and social conceptions to the cosmos. No philosopher before Plato\n                    explicitly
  refers to his cosmological images as images\n                    (εἰκόνεσ),\n                    and
  yet it is unlikely that any of them simply failed to differentiate\n                    at
  all between the realm of society and that of nature, the relations\n                    between
  which had become, by the end of the fifth century at least, the\n                    subject
  of heated controversy. Heraclitus, for instance, tacitly distin- guishes between
  human laws and the\n                    divine law, while saying that the former
  depend on the latter, in frag.\n                     114. Evidently he did not simply
  confuse human soci- ety and cosmic order. Yet law and justice applied to\n                    the
  cosmos were no mere figures of speech, for order in the human sphere\n                    was
  regularly conceived as part of the wider cosmic\n                    order and as
  somehow derived from it.\n                        2. Vitalist Images.\n                     Most
  of the earlier pre-Socratic philosophers imagined that the\n                    primary
  stuff out of which things are made or from which they\n                    originate
  is not merely like something that is\n                    alive, but is indeed instinct
  with life. This is\n                    true of all three Milesian philosophers
  and of Heraclitus; when he\n                    describes the world-order as an
  “ever-living” fire in\n                    frag. 30, “ever-\n                    living”
  is not simply a poetical equivalent for\n                        “ever- lasting,”\n
  \                   for he held that fire is indeed the substance of which our own
  souls\n                    consist. Later the Atomists too seem to have believed
  that the mass of\n                    atoms from which worlds originate is instinct
  with life in the sense\n                    that it is permeated by soul-atoms.
  Although Aristotle ridiculed the belief\n                    that soul is intermingled
  in the whole universe, he himself held that the\n                    heavenly bodies
  are alive, and indeed some of his general physi- cal theories, for example the doctrine
  of\n                    potentiality and actuality, are much influenced by ideas
  which apply\n                    primarily to the sphere of living things.These
  and other vitalist beliefs affected the develop- ment of Greek cosmology in three
  main ways.\n                    First, the earliest philosophers were “hylozoists”;\n
  \                   they as- sumed that the primary substance, being\n                    alive,
  is in motion. The question of the origin or cause of move- ment only came to be
  recognized as a\n                    problem after Parmenides had denied the possibility
  of change.Secondly, vitalist notions are naturally very impor-\n                        tant
  in accounts of how the world developed from an original,\n                    undifferentiated
  state. Anaximander, for ex-\n                    ample, pictured the world evolving
  from a seed that separated off\n                    from the Boundless, and some
  of the Pythagoreans too thought that the One\n                    from which the
  cosmos developed was composed of seed.Thirdly, the structure of the cosmos was sometimes
  compared with that of man\n                    and vice versa. The idea that the
  world is a living creature may underlie\n                    the comparison that
  Anaximenes drew between the role of air in the\n                    world and that
  of breath in man. But two of the Hippocratic treatises put\n                    forward
  much more elaborate analogies between the microcosm and the\n                    macrocosm.
  In De victu man's body is said to be\n                    a copy of the world-whole,
  the stomach being compared with the sea and\n                    so on. And De hebdomadibus
  suggests detailed\n                    correspondences both between the substances
  in the body and those in the\n                    universe—where the bones correspond
  to the stony core of the\n                    earth, for example— and between the
  various parts of the body\n                    and different geographical areas—where
  the Thracian Bosphorus is\n                        3. Technological Images.\n                     Several
  of the pre- Socratics use\n                    the metaphor of steering in their
  cos-\n                    mologies, but the first to employ a wide range of technological\n
  \                   images is Empedocles, and then both Plato and Aristotle use
  them\n                    extensively in two con- texts, especially, (1)\n                    to
  describe the role of a moving or efficient cause, and (2) to express the\n                    idea
  of intelli- gent design in the cosmos.In Empedocles' system everything is composed
  of the four\n                    “roots,” earth, water, air, and fire, together
  with\n                    Love and Strife, and in describing how complex substances
  and the organs in\n                    the body come to be he assigns to Love the
  role of craftsman, the four\n                    elements being the material on
  which it works. It would be\n                    anachronistic to attribute a clear
  distinction between\n                    “material” and “efficient” causes to\n
  \                   Empedocles; but it is in the descriptions of the craftsmanlike\n
  \                   activity of Love that he comes closest to treating it as a purely\n
  \                   efficient cause. Plato's Timaeus is the first Greek\n                    text
  to describe the formation of the world as a whole as the work of\n                    a
  Craftsman. In Plato the Demiurge takes over already existing matter and\n                    imposes
  order on its disorderly movements, and his account of the\n                    details
  of creation is full of images drawn from carpentry, weaving,\n                    modelling,
  metallurgy, and agricultural tech-\n                    nology. Aristotle's unmoved
  mover, unlike Plato's Craftsman, is only\n                    a final, not an efficient
  cause; but Aristotle too believes that final\n                    causes are at
  work in natural processes, and he uses comparisons drawn\n                    from
  the arts and crafts extensively to illustrate this. Despite their\n                    unconcealed
  contempt for the life led by merely human artisans, both Plato\n                    and
  Aristotle found techno- logical\n                    imagery indispensable for expressing
  their belief in the rational design of\n                    the universe.The history
  of early Greek cosmology is largely the history of the\n                    interpretation
  of the cosmos in terms of various ideas derived from the\n                    three
  fields of politics, biology, and technology. Aristotle, especially,\n                    criticized
  many such ideas, as for example the belief that such\n                    substances
  as air or fire are alive. Yet these three types of images\n                    continued
  to be influential long after him. The Stoics, in particular, not\n                    only
  represented the cosmos as a living creature and believed in the pur- poseful, craftsmanlike
  activity of Nature,\n                    but also\n                     described
  the world as a state governed by divine law, and\n                    similar ideas
  had a long history in the Middle Ages and in the Renaissance.Moreover while Greek
  cosmology owed many ideas to politics and biology,\n                    Greek biological
  theories and political thought were similarly colored by\n                    the
  use of images drawn from one another. For example, the twin ideas\n                    that
  health depends on the equality of rights\n                    (ἰσονομία)\n                    of
  opposed powers in the body, and that disease results from the supreme\n                    rule\n
  \                   (μοναρχία)\n                    of one such power, go back to
  Alcmaeon and thereafter be- come commonplaces of Greek pathology and thera- peutics.
  Aristotle, too, compares the\n                    living creature with a well-governed
  city, describing the heart as the\n                    central seat of authority
  in the body (e.g., De motu\n                        animalium 703a 29ff.).Conversely
  Greek political theorists sometimes compare the state with a\n                    living
  organism, and the influence of other biological and technological\n                        analo-
  gies on Greek ethics is marked.\n                    Here Plato provides the best
  examples. First he constructed an\n                    elaborate analogy between
  the state and the individual in theRepublic, suggesting, for instance, that both
  may be\n                    divided into three parts, one of which—the Guardians
  in the\n                    state and reason in the soul—should be in overall control.
  A\n                    second important analogy in Plato is that between justice
  and health. This\n                    provides the main grounds for the two theses,
  (1) that the just man is\n                    happier than the unjust, and (2) that
  once having done wrong, it is better\n                    to suffer than to escape
  punish-\n                    ment—for punishment is the “cure” for\n                    injustice.
  And a third recurrent analogy is that between the\n                    politician
  and the artist or craftsman, where Plato suggests that the\n                    statesman
  must be an expert in politics in a way comparable with that in\n                    which
  a pilot is expert in navigation or a doctor in medicine. We find\n                    similar
  types of analogies in Aristotle, too. In the Politics (1295a 40f.) he describes
  the constitution as the life,\n                    as it were, of the state, and
  in the Nicomachean\n                    Ethics (1113a 25ff.) he draws a comparison
  between the good man\n                    and the healthy: just as a sick person
  may be mistaken about what is hot or\n                    cold or sweet or bitter,
  and the judge of these things is the normal,\n                    healthy man, so,
  he argues, the good man (ὁ\n                    σπουδαῖος)\n                    is
  the judge of what is right and wrong.Greek ideas on nature and art, on the state,
  the living organism, and the\n                    world as a whole, are linked by
  a series of interlocking analogies. Most of\n                    the major fifth-
  and fourth-century\n                    philosophers put forward analogies of one
  or other of the types we have\n                    considered. Yet the particular
  forms that their analogies take are\n                    very varied, and no single
  version of any of them dominates the\n                    period. Had any such orthodoxy
  existed, these analogies might have impeded\n                    the development
  of certain inquiries far more than they did. As it was,Two other features of the
  role of analogy in early Greek thought that are\n                    especially
  notable are (1) their use as a method of suggesting or\n                    supporting
  explana- tions of particular\n                    natural phenomena, and (2) the
  gradual exploration of the logic of analogy.\n                    The begin- nings
  of the first use go back to\n                    the Milesians, who based many of
  their accounts of obscure\n                    astronomical, meteorological, and
  geological phenomena on simple\n                    analogies with familiar objects.
  Thus Anaximenes compared lightning with\n                    the flash made by an
  oar in water, believing both phenomena to be the\n                    result of
  a cleaving process. His predecessor Anaximander sug- gested a more elaborate and
  artificial\n                    analogy in which he pictured the heavenly bodies
  as wheels of fire\n                    enclosed in mist; the stars themselves are
  seen through openings in the\n                    mist, and he described eclipses
  of the sun and moon as being due to the\n                    temporary blocking
  of their apertures. Primitive though this theory is,\n                    it ranks
  as the first known attempt to construct a me- chanical model of the heavenly bodies.The
  use of such comparisons grows as the range of problems investigated is\n                    extended.
  Empedocles and some of the Hippocratic writers, especially,\n                    propose
  ingenious analogies to explain processes that take place\n                    within
  the body. Thus Empedocles compares the proc-\n                    ess of respiration
  with the action of a clepsydra (water clock).\n                        De natura
  pueri compares the formation of\n                    a membrane round the seed in
  the womb with that of a crust on bread as\n                    it is baked, and
  De morbis IV compares the\n                    formation of stones in the bladder
  with the smelting of iron ore. The same\n                    writer also illustrates
  how the humors travel between different parts of\n                    the body by
  referring to the way in which a system of three or more\n                    intercommunicating
  vessels may be filled with a liquid or emptied by\n                    filling or
  emptying one of them, and on other occasions, too, Greek\n                    scientists
  refer to simple tests carried out on substances outside the\n                    body
  in their search for analogies for biological processes.These writers rarely examine
  explicitly the question of how the analogies\n                    they propose apply
  to the phe- nomena they\n                    were supposed to explain, and many
  of\n                     their ideas seem farfetched. Even so, analogy provided
  an\n                    important, indeed in some cases the only, means of bringing
  empirical\n                    evidence to bear on obscure or intractable problems,
  especially in such\n                    fields as as- tronomy and meteorology,\n
  \                   embryology and pathology, where direct experimentation was generally
  out of\n                    the question.Various writers, beginning with Anaxagoras
  at the end of the fifth century,\n                    refer to this use of analogy
  under the general heading of making\n                    “phenomena the vision of
  things that are obscure”\n                    (ὄψισ\n                    τω̑ν\n
  \                   ἀδήλων\n                    τὰ\n                    φαινόμενα),\n
  \                   and awareness of most of the different modes of analogy grows
  rapidly in\n                    the fourth century. Plato, himself one of the chief
  exponents of\n                    reasoning from analogy, was the first to point
  out how deceptive\n                    similarities may be, and to draw attention
  to the differ- ence between merely probable arguments, including\n                    emotive
  images and myths, and demonstrations. Then Aristotle analyzed\n                    analogical
  argument as such in the form of the paradigm, explaining its\n                    relation
  to induc- tion and showing that it is\n                    not formally demonstrative.
  Nevertheless he granted its usefulness as a\n                    persuasive argument
  in the field of rhetoric, and he even described\n                    how a dialectician
  may exploit similarities in order to deceive an\n                    opponent. Plato
  and Aristotle made decisive advances in exploring the logic\n                    of
  arguments from analogy: yet the effect of their work was not, of\n                    course,
  to preclude the use of such arguments, but rather to show that\n                    they
  are not formally valid. Moreover while Aristotle successfully analyzed\n                    analogy
  as a method of inference, neither he nor any later Greek logician\n                    made
  much progress towards elucidating the other important function of\n                    analogy,
  namely as a method of discovery in natural science.The principal texts are discussed
  in G. E. R. Lloyd,Polarity and Analogy: two types of argumentation in\n                            early
  Greek thought (Cambridge, 1966), which includes an exten- sive bibliography. See
