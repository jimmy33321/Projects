  Table 1 illustrates the rank of countries according to their share of world articles and indicates the equivalent rank for each country according to citations received.

  In the original article on Geographical trends of research output Table 1 had an incorrect year range label which stated 2004 -2007. The data portrayed in this table actually pertains to 1996 - 2007. We apologies for this oversight in this label.

  Table 1 – Geographical distribution of world articles 1996 – 2007 – top 20 countries. Source: Scopus. Researcher data taken from OECD Main Science & Technology Indicators, 2008 edition; data is for 2004 FTE researchers. US Researcher Data taken from Science & Engineering Indicators 2008, Table 3.1.
- |
  Table 2 illustrates that if the 2004 output of articles in Scopus is compared to researcher numbers in 2004 for these countries, some interesting trends develop. For instance, the number of researchers per research article published varies remarkably. It is important to note that this is different to authors per published article; in this case we are calculating the ratio of total researchers in a country to the publication output of the country. In many cases, there are researchers who never appear on articles as authors, and this is an important distinction to consider.
- |
  In Russia, there are 30 researchers for each research article published, while in the US there are 23 researchers. Switzerland has the lowest number of researchers per article at 2.5, followed by the UK at 3.2.

  Table 2 – Researcher numbers for 2004 (source: OECD, US Data from NSF Science & Engineering Indicators 2008, table 3.1) and articles published in 2004 (source: Scopus).
- |
  The question follows, why do these countries have such differences in the researcher per article ratio?
- |
  Of course this is a difficult question to answer and has many dimensions, all of which will contribute in different amounts in different countries.
- |
  Fundamentally, overall population density, economic factors such as GDP and per capita expenditure and infrastructure will be significant factors in the ability to support research, but we are quick to point out that the countries that have the lower ratios, such as the UK and Switzerland, have some of the highest economic capabilities and strongest infrastructures in the world – this illustrates the issues in trying to understand these differences. Certainly, research funding from both governmental and private sources will affect the maintenance of research institutions and the ability to recruit research personnel. In the US, many research institutions have huge programs that require a substantial amount of staff members, which will increase the researcher numbers in our ratio.
- |
  In addition, the ability of a country to actually encourage students to follow a research path can often be problematic – in recent times in the UK there has been commentary on the problems of filling university places in subjects such as chemistry and physics and a study by Olivieri & Rowlands (2006) indicated that acquiring research staff was one of biggest barriers to research performance, which could be a significant factor to understand these interesting ratios between articles and researchers.

  infrastructures in the world – this illustrates the issues in trying to understand
  these differences. Certainly, research funding from both governmental and private
  sources will affect the maintenance of research institutions and the ability to
  recruit research personnel. In the US, many research institutions have huge programs
  that require a substantial amount of staff members, which will increase the researcher
  numbers in our ratio.In addition, the ability of a country to actually encourage
  students to follow a research path can often be problematic – in recent times in
  the UK there has been commentary on the problems of filling university places in
  subjects such as chemistry and physics and a study by Olivieri & Rowlands (2006)
  indicated that acquiring research staff was one of biggest barriers to research
  performance, which could be a significant factor to understand these interesting
  ratios between articles and researchers.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

  trendsNovember 2008Geographical trends of research output\r\n\t\t\tThe publication
  of journal articles worldwide follows a consistent pattern associated with the number
  of researchers based in a particular country. Unsurprisingly, the share of world
  articles is dominated by those countries with the most researchers, with countries
  such as the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom and Germany ranked highest.
  The geographical distribution of citations shows a similar pattern, with the same
  four countries appearing in the top four places according to citations received,
  albeit in a slightly different order. The growth in Chinese researcher numbers and
  research output has been previously discussed in Research Trends.\nTable 1 illustrates
  the rank of countries according to their share of world articles and indicates the
  equivalent rank for each country according to citations received.\nIn the original
  article on Geographical trends of research output Table 1 had an incorrect year
  range label which stated 2004 -2007. The data portrayed in this table actually pertains
  to 1996 - 2007. We apologies for this oversight in this label.\nRank   by articles\nRank

  Source: Scopus. Researcher data taken from OECD Main Science & Technology Indicators,
  2008 edition; data is for 2004 FTE researchers. US Researcher Data taken from Science
  & Engineering Indicators 2008, Table 3.1.\nTable 2 illustrates that if the 2004
  output of articles in Scopus is compared to researcher numbers in 2004 for these
  countries, some interesting trends develop. For instance, the number of researchers
  per research article published varies remarkably. It is important to note that this
  is different to authors per published article; in this case we are calculating the
  ratio of total researchers in a country to the publication output of the country.
  In many cases, there are researchers who never appear on articles as authors, and
  this is an important distinction to consider.\nIn Russia, there are 30 researchers
  for each research article published, while in the US there are 23 researchers. Switzerland
  has the lowest number of researchers per article at 2.5, followed by the UK at 3.2.\nCountry\nNumber

  2 – Researcher numbers for 2004 (source: OECD, US Data from NSF Science & Engineering
  Indicators 2008, table 3.1) and articles published in 2004 (source: Scopus).\nThe
  question follows, why do these countries have such differences in the researcher
  per article ratio?\nOf course this is a difficult question to answer and has many
  dimensions, all of which will contribute in different amounts in different countries.\nFundamentally,
  overall population density, economic factors such as GDP and per capita expenditure
  and infrastructure will be significant factors in the ability to support research,
  but we are quick to point out that the countries that have the lower ratios, such
  as the UK and Switzerland, have some of the highest economic capabilities and strongest
  infrastructures in the world – this illustrates the issues in trying to understand
  these differences. Certainly, research funding from both governmental and private
  sources will affect the maintenance of research institutions and the ability to
  recruit research personnel. In the US, many research institutions have huge programs
  that require a substantial amount of staff members, which will increase the researcher
  numbers in our ratio.\nIn addition, the ability of a country to actually encourage
  students to follow a research path can often be problematic – in recent times in
  the UK there has been commentary on the problems of filling university places in
  subjects such as chemistry and physics and a study by Olivieri & Rowlands (2006)
  indicated that acquiring research staff was one of biggest barriers to research
  performance, which could be a significant factor to understand these interesting
  ratios between articles and researchers.\nVN:F [1.9.22_1171]please wait...Rating:
