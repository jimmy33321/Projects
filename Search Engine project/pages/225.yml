  Spanish, French and Brazilian Portuguese versions of our site, too.\r\nTo date,
  we have delivered over 580Â million lessons and learners have completed over 3.8Â billion
  exercise problems (which is around 4 million per day!). In addition we have over
  one millionÂ registered teachers around the world who use Khan Academy in their
  classrooms to help to inspire, motivate and guide students through their learning
  paths.\r\nKhan Academy covers subjects from basic Math to Physics, Biology, Economics,
