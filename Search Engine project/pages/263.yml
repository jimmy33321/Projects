                  AMBIGUITY ASAESTHETIC PRINCIPLE
- |2
                  In Western cultural history ambiguity has been a pejorative term until the twentieth century.
- |2
                      This bias against the presence of two or more meanings in any
- |2
                      statement reflects the general bias of the civilization which traditionally
- |2
                      from Classical Greek times has placed its faith in reason and an orderly
- |2
                      universe—a civilization which, by extension, has operated on a
- |2
                      tacit belief in the reliability of the reasoning process and its
- |2
                      correspondence with external reality. Consequently men for centuries did
- |2
                      not question the relationship between words and things, and were able to
- |2
                      assume that no responsible statement could contradict any049
- |2
                       other, that if apparent contradictions emerged in speaking,
- |2
                      clarity and coherence, hence truth, could be achieved by amplification.
- |2
                      Thus the Greek word for universe
- |2
                      (κόσμος) carried both a
- |2
                      scientific and an aes- thetic meaning.
- |2
                      Ambiguity in this cultural context represented therefore a failure at
- |2
                      truth, a failure in communication attributable either to excessive
- |2
                      brevity, deliberate obscurity of phrasing, or to ineptitude.
- |2
                  Nevertheless, in spite of this general prejudice against confusing or
- |2
                      misleading statements, certain kinds of ambiguous utterances were
- |2
                      acceptable to the ancient Greeks. The earliest examples of these ambig- uities are sub-literary and are cast in
- |2
                      forms that still reflect the primitive faith in a world that contains
- |2
                      precise answers to all questions. Oracular utterances emanating from holy
- |2
                      places presupposed the accuracy of the priestess's veiled message, since it
- |2
                      was the voice of God that spoke through her. Because the passive role
- |2
                      of medium did not include comprehension, eluci-
- |2
                          dation for the priestess as well as the petitioner came with the
- |2
                      passage of time. With arcane formulae and recipes the speaker assumed an
- |2
                      active role—curses, spells, charms, and ritual signs and dances
- |2
                      being early examples of human attempts to control external events
- |2
                      through empirical means. The body of knowledge behind these practical
- |2
                      skills was invariably recorded in symbolic language, but the obscurity of
- |2
                      this form of technical jargon could have been ambiguous only to the
- |2
                      non-initiates of occult fraternities.
- |2
                  Closer to art in our sense of the word are riddles which are
- |2
                      self-annihilating word games, a form of social entertainment that also
- |2
                      presupposes the existence of precise answers to questions, but which
- |2
                      require the agency of interlocutor and respondee to complete the
- |2
                      process: riddles cease to exist when the meaning is discovered. The
- |2
                      contrivance of an endpoint of only one possible answer or meaning
- |2
                      differentiates riddles from enigmas, myths, and genuine works of art for
- |2
                      which there are no determinable endpoints of contemplation. Ambiguity
- |2
                      as an aesthetic principle emerged therefore when artists deliberately
- |2
                      contrived complex structures that generated a plurality of meanings.
- |2
                  In Greek literature it was the mantic Pindar who modified the oracular
- |2
                      tradition for artistic purposes. In the Hymn to Zeus
- |2
                      (only fragments of which have survived) God announces that no beauty is
- |2
                      complete without praise. By inference, therefore, the poet's sta- tus was holy and his function was to
- |2
                      celebrate. But what Pindar was celebrating in his hymns of victory for
- |2
                      athletes, and why the odes are apparently lacking in unity constitute an
- |2
                      enigma. While there is no mys- tery as to to
- |2
                      whom the
- |2
                      ἐπινίκια
- |2
                      were addressed, there is ambiguity as to the true subject of the poems.
- |2
                          More- over the praises characteristically
- |2
                      open brilliantly, as
- |2
                       all readers have remarked, but trail off and merely stop, a
- |2
                      criticism that may not be relevant to works meant to be orchestrated and

                      choreographed. Nevertheless the structural peculiarities may point to
- |2
                      another level of meaning if the poems are accepted as Pindar's records
- |2
                      of theophanies that occurred at religious games, an institution that was
- |2
                      more ancient than Homer and the Trojan War. Traditionally, the arena
- |2
                      in which the contest took place was sacred ground, the athletic event an
- |2
                          agon, and the victory a kairos that transformed the contestant into a hero, a term
- |2
                      originally applied only to the dead, but progressively applied to the
- |2
                      living.
- |2
                  This cultural change created a third, ambiguous middle zone between the
- |2
                      natural and supernatural worlds, in metaphysical terms a new ontological
- |2
                          cate- gory to which the living aspired.
- |2
                      Through excellence which led to transcendence, the presence of the
- |2
                      gods could be summoned to this juncture between two worlds. Victory
- |2
                      conferred therefore a multivalent status upon the hero, the attainment of a
- |2
                      more complete state of being poised between time and eternity. But the
- |2
                      duration of this achievement was also ambiguous, since on the level of
- |2
                      actuality the victory won by the indi- vidual
- |2
                      could be lost at the next festival. It is likely, therefore, that the
- |2
                      poet's solution to this cultural para- dox was
- |2
                      the juxtaposition of his favorite images in the context of an amorphous
- |2
                      structure: gold representing the permanence of the state of pure being;
- |2
                      light repre- senting the incandescent
- |2
                      moment of victory when the hero became a presence, its occurrence a
- |2
                      metaphor for the process of heroization, and its visible behavior
- |2
                      mysterious and of short duration. The waning structure of the Pindarics may
- |2
                      allude therefore to metaphysical problems that had no solutions, problems
- |2
                      that in a prelogical age could be expressed only in mythopoeic terms.
- |2
                  The traditional practice of classifying according to the place of the
- |2
                      festival might have been consonant with Pindar's intention, for if the
- |2
                      poems were records of theophanies, where they occurred was more impor- tant than other considerations. The Olympia I, in Richmond Lattimore's translation, begins:
- "                        \n"
- |2
                              Best of all things is water; but gold, like a gleaming fireby night, outshines all pride of wealth beside.But, my heart, would you chant the glory of games,look never beyond the sunby day for any star shining brighter through the deserted air,nor any contest than Olympia greater to sing.It is thence that the song winds strandsin the hearts of the skilled to celebratethe son of Kronos. They come their waysto the magnificent board of Hieron....
- "                    \n"
- |2
                      050
- |2
                       A prose reading structured according to hierarchy might be as
- |2
                      follows:
- "                \n"
- |2
                      Water is the best of all things if usefulness is the criterion, but it
- |2
                          is too humble and ordinary to attract attention. Gold, on the other
- |2
                          hand, not only has the appearance of excellence but is in fact more
- |2
                          valuable than other metals. But better than either of these is my ode
- |2
                          composed at Olympia, sacred to Zeus, and occasioned by the victory of
- |2
                          Syracusan Hieron....
- "                \n"
- |2
                  That this univocal lucidity was achieved by limiting meanings either by
- |2
                      amplification or its opposites, com-
- |2
                      pression or suppression, reveals something of the aims and
- |2
                      techniques of Pindar. A multivalenced reading might superimpose upon the
- |2
                      prose version the follow- ing:
- "                \n"
- |2
                      Water is the best of all things because it supports life which is the
- |2
                          best of all things. But what is best in the world of nature is not best
- |2
                          in the metaphysical realm, since the gold of pure being outshines the
- |2
                          earthly fame that adheres to the possessors of great wealth. But I am a
- |2
                          poet, and poetry is of this world. Therefore in the search for subjects
- |2
                          I look no further than the visible world, but choose excellence.
- |2
                          The sun has no rivals for brilliance by day, Olympia—sacred
- |2
                          to the son of Kronos—none for antiquity and dignity....
- "                \n"
- |2
                  Pindar has contrived different levels of reality with different criteria of
- |2
                      excellence through the use of gnomic opening, riddle, paradox, symbol,
- |2
                      myth, and a multiplicity of meanings through overlapping cate- gories. Moreover, suppressed information
- |2
                      that must be inferred is not only technique but meaning in poems that
- |2
                      both celebrate and are theophanies. Olympia is compared to the sun that
- |2
                      makes invisible lesser stars. That Pythia, Isthmia, and Nemea are not
- |2
                      mentioned may be more than tact. Also, the term “Son of
- |2
                      Kronos” is not only traditional formula, but a way of
- |2
                      evoking both gods for the purpose of opposing Time with Permanence if
- |2
                      the self-manifestation of Zeus is the true subject of the poem. Standing,
- |2
                      as it were, historically between Mycenae and Athens, and artistically
- |2
                      between temple and hippodrome, the Theban Pindar in life was awarded
- |2
                      the right to an equal share of first-fruit offer-
- |2
                          ings by the Pythian priestess of Delphi, and after death,
- |2
                      heroization, his ghost being invited annually to dine with Apollo (Gilbert
- |2
                      Norwood, Pindar [1945]). But religious games,
- |2
                      Thebes, and Pindar were all anachro- nisms
- |2
                      in the light of world history, for the political reality of the expansion
- |2
                      of the Persian Empire and the need for a Greek response gave the leadership
- |2
                      of that civilization to Athens.
- |2
                  The rapidity of change that accounts for the ultimate displacement of the
- |2
                      arts in Athens also explains the ascendance of drama over lyric in the
- |2
                      early stages of this process. For, according to John H. Finley, Jr.,
- |2
                      Aeschylus was “the inventor of the idea of meaningful
- |2
                       time” (Pindar and Aeschylus
- |2
                      [1955]). But the optimistic view of history presented in Aeschylus' Oresteia gave way to the inconclusive debate in
- |2
                      Sophocles' Antigone, and to the doubts raised as to
- |2
                      the ambiguous benefits of language in Euripides' Hippolytus, for the cultural relativity introduced by the
- |2
                      Sophists had challenged not only the traditional content of the arts, but
- |2
                      the connection between words and things, as well. Thus on the one hand
- |2
                      Aristophanes complained that “They have dethroned Zeus, and
- |2
                      Vortex is King” (Georgio di Santillana, The
- |2
                          Origins of Scientific Thought [1961]). On the other hand, the new
- |2
                      status of language as reasoning instrument made words the domain of crea- tors of systems: the scientists,
- |2
                      philosophers, and histo- rians in whom the
- |2
                      tacit faith of the dramatists was continued. Their assertion of the
- |2
                      inevitability of conse- quences from acts
- |2
                      knowingly or unwittingly committed was abstracted as the uniformity of
- |2
                      nature's laws which could be discovered by following the laws of logic.
- |2
                      For the rationalists, therefore, ambiguity was neither thing nor
- |2
                      principle, but a phase in the reasoning process between perception and
- |2
                      knowledge. But the history of this movement was also one of degeneration,
- |2
                      since “Men seemed to be capable of sacrificing the Law of
- |2
                      Contradiction for the sake of comfort” (George Boas,Rationalism in Greek Philosophy [1961]).
- |2
                  The history of rationalism parallels the story of introspection and the
- |2
                      discovery of the self. The reduc- tion of the
- |2
                      wealth of Homeric terms for what subse-
- |2
                      quently were the simplified categories of “body”
- |2
                      and “soul” reveals the metamorphosis of the
- |2
                      conception of man from aggregate to unit, a change confirmed in art by
- |2
                      the abandonment of the geometric style of the late archaic period (Bruno
- |2
                      Snell, The Discovery of the Mind: The Greek Origins of
- |2
                          European Thought [1953]). This unification through simplification
- |2
                          pro- duced at the same time a common
- |2
                      denominator that could be projected either as causal nexus or as focus
- |2
                      of interest for artistic purposes. The failure of Greek politics thus gave
- |2
                      a new direction to the arts in the Greco-Roman period (Moses Hadas, Hellenistic Cul- ture: Fusion
- |2
                          and Diffusion [1959]). The emergence of the spiritual landscape of
- |2
                      the pastoral lyric asserted the validity of the private and subjective
- |2
                      world; the improbable world of the romances proclaimed at the same
- |2
                      time the unpredictability of Fortune and a faith in an incomprehensible but
- |2
                      benign Providence; and the composition of spiritual biographies called
- |2
                      aretologies that transformed moral teachers into cult
- |2
                      figures—all point to the kind of consolation men sought.
- |2
                  Nevertheless, after Aristotle, literary works ad-
- |2
                          dressed to the reason as well as to the sentiments were subject
- |2
                      to more stringent standards of consistency, hence the criticism of Vergil's
- |2
                          Aeneid that persists to this day. Apparently in
- |2
                      the cultural climate of his time,051
- |2
                       even the political success of Augustan Rome did not prevent the
- |2
                      poet from longing for the other world, and this moral ambivalence produced
- |2
                      an artistic duplicity in an epic that attempted to satisfy by simple juxta- position the rival claims of both
- |2
                      worlds. The two halves of the epic are thus disjunctive, the first modeled
- |2
                      upon the horizontal plan of the Odyssey, the second
- |2
                      upon the vertical transcendence of the Iliad, with
- |2
                      no attempt to relate them. At mid-point between the two halves Vergil
- |2
                      placed the gates from the underworld (VI, 888-98; Loeb
- |2
                          Library, I, 571):
- "                \n"
- |2
                      And when Anchises had led his son over every scene, and fired his soul
- |2
                          with love of fame that was to be, he tells him then of the wars he must
- |2
                          thereafter wage, and instructs him of the Laurentine peoples and the
- |2
                          city of Latinus and how he is to flee or face each toil.
- |2
                      Two gates of Sleep there are, whereof the one is said to be of horn, and
- |2
                          thereby an easy outlet is given to true shades; the other gleaming with
- |2
                          the sheen of polished ivory, but false are the dreams sent by the
- |2
                          spirits to the world above. There then with these words Anchises
- |2
                          attends both his son and the Sibyl, and dismisses them by the ivory
- |2
                          gate.
- "                \n"
- |2
                  Because this episode is pivotal, its interpretation will determine the
- |2
                      meaning of the whole work. The easiest solution is to conjecture a mistake
- |2
                      on the part of the author. The principle of durior
- |2
                          lectio, on the other hand, requires a reading of the text as
- |2
                      it stands. Clearly Aeneas and the Sibyl have made their exit from the
- |2
                      wrong gate if the world of political Rome is not to be dismissed as a vain
- |2
                      dream; alternatively if the reality of Rome is asserted, Aeneas himself is
- |2
                      a false dream. Thus the Law of Contradiction is evoked, and as the two
- |2
                      halves of the epic seem mutually exclusive, cen-
- |2
                          turies of readers have in effect discarded the last six books.
- |2
                      It is likely, however, that the poet was in fact asserting both worlds but
- |2
                      could find no satisfactory solution to his problem. The characterization of
- |2
                      his eponymous hero as “pious” was Vergil's way of
- |2
                      making him both historical founder and presiding genius of city and
- |2
                      empire. Whereas the fusion of two roles in one character succeeded, the
- |2
                      work as a whole did not, and the poet's instruction in his will that the
- |2
                      epic be de- stroyed may be interpreted as the
- |2
                      recognition of his failure to reconcile the ideas of history and
- |2
                      eternity, a conjecture made more probable by the fact that Vergil died
- |2
                      in Greece while revising the Aeneid. The precise
- |2
                      destination of Vergil's cultural pilgrimage is unknown, but it was at
- |2
                      Alexandria, through Philo's multileveled but unified interpretation of
- |2
                      sacred his- tory, that a solution was found.
- |2
                      Philo's elaborate rami- fications of the
- |2
                      allegorical method are, therefore, the first critical treatises on one,
- |2
                      perhaps the most rational, type of ambiguity.
- |2
                  Among the backgrounds to the solution of this two-
- |2
                      fold problem was typology, a chronological projection
- |2
                       of allegory that was one of the several innovations of the Old
- |2
                      Testament Prophets. Responding to the imme-
- |2
                      diate political needs of a threatened Judea, their messi- anic message fused policy with prophecy by
- |2
                      historical analogy. The recurrent cycle of slavery and deliverance
- |2
                      encouraged faith in a redeemer; therefore some of these leaders saw their
- |2
                      lives as both fact and symbol: they were “types” of
- |2
                      Moses and Messiah, intermediary fig- ures that
- |2
                      recapitulated past events while prophetically living the future. And by
- |2
                      generalizing and extending in both directions it was possible to join
- |2
                      together the end of history with its beginning, erasing the
- |2
                      distinction between prophecy and apocalypse; thus for Isaiah, the
- |2
                      Messiah that he prophesied was to be another Adam in another Paradise:
- "                \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse.... And
- |2
                              righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness
- |2
                              the girdle of his reins. The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb,
- |2
                              and the leopard shall lie down with the kid.... And the lion shall
- |2

                  Isaiah's inclusion of a genealogy was an expression of faith in the
- |2
                      continuity of history, even as his projec-
- |2
                      tion of a Messiah documented the need for a cult figure (as
- |2
                      alternative to relapse into idolatry) to focus the aspirations of a people
- |2
                      in troubled times. Centuries later the selection of Jesus as the announced
- |2
                      Second Adam gave to his followers a fixed point for their
- |2
                      interpretation of history, and Moses was then reduced to a
- |2
                      “type” who prefigured the Christ in whom the Law and
- |2
                      the Prophetic promises were fulfilled. Alle-
- |2
                      gory became therefore an indispensable tool for this new religion
- |2
                      with evangelical and universalist aims.
- |2
                  The Prophetic interpretation of political events constituted in effect the
- |2
                      invention of world history. And because history was the revealed will of
- |2
                      God, approved records of the past were subsequently organized into a
- |2
                      canon and elevated to the status of Scripture. The transcendence implied by
- |2
                      this new category of writing produced therefore works in Greco-Roman times
- |2
                      that took on the character of vulgate romances with apocry- phal additions. The linear projection of history
- |2
                      was now abandoned in favor of a single character who anachronistically
- |2
                      embodied the past and future experi- ence of
- |2
                      the people. But world history could also be projected in this fashion, as
- |2
                      in the case of the gigantic statue of Nebuchadnezzar's dream, the different
- |2
                          mate- rials of which the figure was made
- |2
                      representing the chronology of kingdoms, the last or fifth monarchy
- |2
                      being the millenium. The author of the Book of Daniel (a figure unrecorded
- |2
                      elsewhere before the second cen- tury) retold
- |2
                      therefore the history of the Jews, compos- ing
- |2
                      a “myth” of the Old Testament as nucleus to a story
- |2
                      intended to encourage the people persecuted052
- |2
                       under the Seleucid King, Antiochus Epiphanes. Al- though he set his story in Babylonia and Persia, in
- |2
                      the stratified characterization of Daniel the reader recog- nizes Joseph and Solomon, and in the apocryphal addi- tions the ritualistic bias of the Haggidic
- |2
                      tradition. In short, the character of Daniel is an “historical
- |2
                          ex- emplum,” and the technique
- |2
                      of deliberate anachronism allowed the author to shift from Hebrew to
- |2
                      late Aramaic in mid-sentence, a fact that could not be passed
- |2
                      unobserved by his first readers. Seen in this light, the Book of Daniel
- |2
                      served the same aretalogical pur- pose as the
- |2
                      Gospels, the author's open-ended scheme consistent with a religion
- |2
                      historically predicated on the metaphysical principle of becoming. But
- |2
                      unlike the Gospels, Daniel records the Jewish retreat from uni- versalism, a fact that also explains
- |2
                      their rejection of Philo as biblical exegete. Contrary to his
- |2
                      intentions, therefore, Philo became the ancestor to the medieval
- |2
                      Christian philosophers (Harry Austryn Wolfson, Philo, 2 vols. [1962]).
- |2
                  The allegorization that unified the Old and New Testaments for the
- |2
                      Christians also transformed their Bible into a universal history; therefore
- |2
                      the word alle- gory acquired a new meaning. For
- |2
                      the Greek ration- alists, allegory referred
- |2
                      merely to a figurative use of language—in short, a fiction. But
- |2
                      for the Christians symbols were nothing less than visible signs of the
- |2
                      Truth they were instructed to propagate universally. In the resulting
- |2
                      conflicts the production of apologies in response to attacks progressively
- |2
                      clarified doctrine and assumptions (Claude Tresmontant, La Métaphy- sique du
- |2
                          christianisme et la naissance de la philosophie
- |2
                      chrétienne [1961]) that later received systematic treat- ment (Étienne Gilson, La Philosophie au Moyen Age [1952]).
- |2
                  But it was on the level of sentiment that the appeal of Christianity lay,
- |2
                      since the pessimism inherent in the Greek cyclical notion of history, and
- |2
                      its counterpart for the individual, endless reincarnation in an un- changing world governed by eternal
- |2
                      laws—could not compete against a religion that recognized the
- |2
                          individ- ual soul and offered a personal
- |2
                      redeemer, a compas- sionate God, and a
- |2
                      progressive, meaningful world his- tory. The
- |2
                      conversion of Constantine that automatically made Christianity the official
- |2
                      religion of the empire, and the expansion of the Church's boundaries as
- |2
                      other forms of rule failed marked the extent and degree of this
- |2
                      cultural revolution. According to Erwin Panofsky, (Gothic
- |2
                          Architecture and Scholasticism [1951], pp. 3, 4):
- "                \n"
- |2
                      To the Carolingian revival of the arts there corresponds, in philosophy,
- |2
                          the phenomenon of John the Scot, equally magnificent, equally
- |2
                          unexpected.... About a hundred years of fermentation in both fields
- |2
                          were followed, in art,
- |2
                           by a variety and contrariety of Romanesque... and, in
- |2
                          theology and philosophy, by a similar multiplicity of diver- gent currents, from uncompromising fideism and
- |2
                          ruthless rationalism to the proto-humanism of... the school of
- |2
                          Chartres.
- "                \n"
- |2
                  The allegory, analogy, and symbolism that charac-
- |2
                          terized medieval thought was the very foundation of the Gothic
- |2
                      church, beginning with the cruciform groundplan and the general orientation
- |2
                      of the struc- ture. The common supposition
- |2
                      that everything visible was a symbol led William Durandus, the thirteenth- century Bishop of Mende, to
- |2
                      compile and invent in his Rationale divinorum
- |2
                          officiorum layer upon layer of meaning to every detail of
- |2
                      church, ornaments, rites, and ceremonies. Thus the foundation of the
- |2
                      church represented Faith; the roof Charity, because it covered a
- |2
                      multitude of sins; the door, Obedience—“If thou wilt
- |2
                      enter into life, keep the Commandments” (Matthew 19:17).
- |2
                      Moreover, the sacristy symbolized the womb of the Virgin Mary where Christ
- |2
                      put on his humanity, since that was where the priests, his
- |2
                      representatives on earth, put on their robes.
- |2
                  Because the main entrance to the church, the west door, faced the material
- |2
                      world from which the laity came to worship, church facades became visual
- |2
                          syn- opses of theology, and in some
- |2
                      instances the anonymous artists found ways to represent doctrinal
- |2
                      ambiguities. Among the statues and the high relief carvings that make
- |2
                      up the facade of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris is a standing niche
- |2
                      figure of the Virgin Mary, heavy with Child. What distinguishes this work
- |2
                      from others that serve a similar architectural function (Adolf
- |2
                      Katzenellenbogen, The Sculptural Programs of Chartres
- |2
                          Cathedral: Christ-Mary-Ecclesia [1959]) is the series of choices
- |2
                      the artist made. Like his contemporaries, in his wish to recall an event in
- |2
                      Time and to evoke its Eternal meaning he engaged in deliberate
- |2
                      anachronism, for his Virgin is not yet the Mother of Jesus; never- theless she is already crowned the
- |2
                      Queen of Heaven. But beyond these conventional details is the more
- |2
                      significant combination of the Virgin's enigmatic smile and the gesture of
- |2
                      her hands, arrested in mid-motion. The viewer is uncertain whether she
- |2
                          (Figlia del tuo Figlio) is blessing the
- |2
                      Fruit of her Womb or whether she is praying to the Eternal God. The
- |2
                      ambiguity in the intent of her gesture reflected that of her status,
- |2
                      for on the one hand the doctrine of Christ's humanity allowed one to
- |2
                      believe that a dutiful Son would be obedient to the wishes of his Mother.
- |2
                      On the other, it was also held that the Incarnation was the greatest
- |2
                      indignity suffered by God—in which case the status of the Virgin
- |2
                      was merely that of the Chosen Vessel which gave her a place of honor but
- |2
                      not necessarily any authority in heaven. Consequently both rank and053
- |2
                       function of Queen of Heaven and Mediatrix of Grace, titles for
- |2
                      which no authority existed, were doubtful.
- |2
                  On the practical level the wish of the Church on Earth to be in accord with
- |2
                      the one in Heaven raised questions touching upon the validity of
- |2
                      unauthorized modes of worship. It is probable that the influence of
- |2
                      Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, the Marian Doctor, en-
- |2
                          couraged the church's toleration of this form of idolatry as
- |2
                      counter-measure against the growing popularity of the secular cult of the
- |2
                      Lady, no longer obscurely deified in trobar
- |2
                      clus, but openly in the vernacular romances (Maurice Valency, In Praise of Love [1958]). The ambiguities that
- |2
                      surround the statue in question stem from the authoritative statement of
- |2
                      doctrine, the Creed, which remains officially a Mystery even today.
- |2
                      The implications of a triune God, his dual nature, and the manner of his
- |2
                      birth challenged the artist to present a mind in tacit play with
- |2
                      unanswerable questions of faith inherent in the figures, both depicted and
- |2
                          con- cealed.
- |2
                  The economic recovery of Europe that permitted the building of cathedrals
- |2
                      also formalized education institutionally (Charles Homer Haskins, The Renais- sance of the
- |2
                          12th Century [1927]) a fact that may explain the shift from
- |2
                      positive to systematic theology. But the pedagogue's shift of focus from a
- |2
                      theory of knowledge to a theory of learning led not only to a
- |2
                      reclassification of things according to theoretical, practical, mechanical,
- |2
                      and logical categories, but to empiricism, as well. Consequently in their
- |2
                          theolog- ical-aesthetic
- |2
                      didascalica they were natural theologians who
- |2
                      believed that the Creator could best be understood by his Creation, and
- |2
                      thereby gave an impetus to the study of the world of things.
- |2
                  They were also mystical theologians who thought in terms of a sequence of
- |2
                      experience out of which knowledge was to be derived for the unification
- |2
                      of man's mind with that of God. Hence the structural metaphor of the
- |2
                      voyage for Saint Bonaventure's Itiner- arium, the nuptial metaphor in Hugh of Saint Victor'sDe arraha animae, and the figure of Jacob in theBenjamin Minor of the later Victorine, Richard. For
- |2
                      Richard, man's ascent from earth to heaven by means of the mystical ladder
- |2
                      was premiss and conclusion. What he analyzed was each episode of Jacob's
- |2
                      life as aspects—ways of seeing and interpreting—of
- |2
                      the ulti- mate unity of things that was implied
- |2
                      by the one- ness of God. The two wives of Jacob
- |2
                      served therefore two functions of as many views of the subject
- |2
                      “Man” as the author cared to contemplate. The fer- tility of Leah and the sterility of Rachel,
- |2
                      on one level, were interpreted as the appetites of the mind (Richard of Saint Victor, ed. and trans. Clare Kirch- berger [1957], p. 91):
- "                \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                       For as it is Leah's part to love since she is the affection of the
- |2
                          soul, so it is Rachel's part to know, for she is reason. The former
- |2
                          gives birth to ordered affection; the latter to the reason or the pure
- |2
                          intelligence. Judah represents to us... love of the highest good. And
- |2
                          when Judah is born... then Rachel begins to desire children
- |2
                          passionately, for she wants to know. Where love is there is vision...
- |2
                          and certainly he who can love invisible things will immediately
- |2
                          desire to know them and to see them by the intelligence.
- "                \n"
- |2
                  The canon regulars of Saint Victor (in whose writings are preserved the
- |2
                      earliest systematic treatment of the four-fold interpretation of Scripture:
- |2
                      literal, allegorical, moral, and anagogical) were the ancestors of the
- |2
                      author of the Epistle to Can Grande. But in adapting
- |2
                      this type of multivalenced textual criticism to the Divine Com- edy the author of the
- |2
                      letter (if it was Dante) stipulated only two, the literal and the
- |2
                      unspecified symbolic, ambiguously stating that the work was
- |2
                          “polysemos, hoc est plurium
- |2
                      sensuum,” thus leaving open the question of how many
- |2
                      levels of meaning apply.
- |2
                  From a structural point of view the Commedia might
- |2
                      have included a fourth part, since the Christian heaven was located outside
- |2
                      the closed Ptolemaic cosmos. But while staying within this universe, Dante
- |2
                      chose to open up his world conditionally. Consequently the problem
- |2
                      that confronts the reader at the end of Purgatorio
- |2
                      is similar to the pivotal episode in the Aeneid. But
- |2
                      unlike Vergil's disjunctive ambiguity, Dante's Garden of Eden is a
- |2
                      conjunctive symbol, the most complex and open of nexuses in Western
- |2
                      letters. In Eden the pilgrim Dante sees in a vision a giant temporalized
- |2
                      emblem (more complex than Dürer's for the Emperor Maxi- milian I) that is a pageant of the
- |2
                      Church. This allegory has been glossed alternatively as the Church
- |2
                      Militant on earth or the Church Triumphant in Heaven, but the
- |2
                      probability that Dante intended both is made more likely by the location of
- |2
                      this episode in the work. For the purposes of his narrative, from Eden the
- |2
                      pilgrim Dante continued his voyage to God in the Paradiso, but in terms of the meaning of the work, the
- |2
                      untold story of the future of mankind also begins at this point. Thus,
- |2
                      on earth, the closed world of moral categories is obliterated by the
- |2
                      recovery of innocence, and even the memory of past history is washed away
- |2
                      by the waters of Lethe or Divine forgiveness, since Scripture assures
- |2
                      us that “When He forgives He forgets.” This
- |2
                      uncanonical second baptism constitutes therefore a new opportunity for man
- |2
                      under the new dispensation of Christian hedonism. Thus Vergil's valedictory
- |2
                          bene- diction to Dante (Purgatorio, XXVII, 131, 142):... lo tuo piacere omai prendi per duce... per ch'io te sovra te
- |2
                          corono e mitrio (“Now take pleasure as your
- |2
                      guide... [because you are now master of yourself, body and soul,] I
- |2
                      therefore crown and mitre you”).
- |2
                  054
- "                \n"
- |2
                  The withdrawal of Vergil as Dante's guide was the poet's way of announcing
- |2
                      the obsolescence of reason as governing principle for human action or
- |2
                      principle of political organization, since the second baptism made
- |2
                      instinctive man's knowledge of natural order, the poet's definition of
- |2
                      Good. His projection of Evil in theInferno recalls therefore the statue in the Book of Daniel, a human anatomy analyzed both
- |2
                      tropologically and chronologically but inverted, its posture repre- senting the stance of sin in relation
- |2
                      to the natural order created by God. Conversely, the figure of
- |2
                      redemption in the Purgatorio is represented upright,
- |2
                      the attainment of the recta ratio by man
- |2
                      paradoxically obliterating his need for it. Consequently the problem that
- |2
                      is raised is the connection in Dante's mind between the ideas of the
- |2
                      possible intellect and plenitude, and what these terms meant to him. In his
- |2
                      political theory, stated in metaphysical terms, Dante was explicit on the
- |2
                      first topic, but not the second (De
- |2
                      Monarchia, trans. H. W. Schneider [1957], p. 6):
- "                \n"
- |2
                      ... since this power can not be completely actualized in a single man or
- |2
                          in any of the particular communi-
- |2
                          ties... there must be a multitude in mankind through whom this
- |2
                          whole power can be actualized; just as there must be a multitude of
- |2
                          created beings to manifest ade- quately
- |2
                          the whole power of prime matter.... With this judgment Averroes agrees
- |2
                          in his commentary on De anima.
- "                \n"
- |2
                  The cultural rebirth of man announced by Dante was projected two centuries
- |2
                      later as a revolution in education by Rabelais, for whom the exploration of
- |2
                          hu- man possibilities through actualization
- |2
                      automatically meant the rejection of allegory and multiple levels of
- |2
                      reality. He therefore blasted, in the Prologue to the First Book of Gargantua, the tradition that had ex- tended from Philo to his day (trans. J. M. Cohen,
- |2
                      Penguin Classics [1955], p. 38):
- "                \n"
- |2
                      But do you faithfully believe that Homer, in writing hisIliad and Odyssey, ever had in
- |2
                          mind the allegories squeezed out of him by Plutarch, Heraclides
- |2
                          Ponticus, Eustathius, and Phornutus, and which Politian afterwards
- |2
                          stole from them in his turn? If you do, you are not within a
- |2
                          hand's or a foot's length of my opinion. For I believe them to
- |2
                          have been as little dreamed of by Homer as the Gospel mysteries
- |2
                          were by Ovid in his Metamorphoses; a case which a
- |2
                          certain Friar Lubin, a true bacon-picker, has actually tried to
- |2
                          prove, in the hope that he may meet others as crazy as himself
- |2
                          and—as the proverb says—a lid to fit his kettle.
- "                \n"
- |2
                  It was not, however, the force of Rabelais' language, but the Scientific
- |2
                      Revolution that destroyed the alle- gorical
- |2
                      method. According to Herbert Butterfield inThe Origins of Modern Science (1957), pp. 7, 8:
- "                \n"
- |2
                      ... it outshines everything since the rise of Christianity and reduces
- |2
                          the Renaissance and Reformation to the rank
- |2
                           of mere episodes, mere internal displacements, within the
- |2
                          system of medieval Christendom.... it changed the character of men's
- |2
                          habitual mental operations... [and] looms so large as the real origin
- |2
                          both of the modern world and of the modern mentality that our customary
- |2
                              periodisa- tion of European
- |2
                          history has become an anachronism and an encumbrance.
- "                \n"
- |2
                  Accordingly, we will approach the centuries extending from the Florentine
- |2
                      Renaissance to the First World War as a single epoch, tracing the principle
- |2
                      of ambig- uity under three headings, all
- |2
                      ultimately derived from geographical and cosmological exploration.

                          1. Accidentalism in Open Systems.
- |2
                       The seeming haphazardness of horizontal and open-ended works in
- |2
                      the Renaissance was implicitly a new projection of ambiguity, for the sole
- |2
                      rule of the Abbey of Thélème—Fay ce que vouldras—when translated to
- |2
                      aesthetic principle produced compositions as savory and varie- gated (but unpredictable) as the Adventures of Pan-
- |2
                      tagruel. Adventures, which for other men had led to the
- |2
                      accidental discovery of new continents while merely searching for new ways
- |2
                      of traveling to places long known, thus unwittingly shifted the center of
- |2
                      the world from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, and added impetus to
- |2
                      the nationalism that challenged with a rival theory of sovereignty the
- |2
                      first modern state, the Church. Similarly the faith in the goodness of
- |2
                      instinct that dignified the study of man's actual behavior led to the
- |2
                      discovery of the ego. But because the ambiguities of accidentalism at this
- |2
                      time had to be conceptualized by alternative characterizations of God as
- |2
                      either the rational or the capricious Uncreated Being, the result for
- |2
                      men was fideistic optimism or nescience. Thus Rabelais' optimism shaded
- |2
                      into skepticism for Mon- taigne, since the
- |2
                      purposeless exploration of the inner world of man raised more questions
- |2
                      than he could answer, or that he answered with another question:“Que sçay-je?” This
- |2
                      impatient shrug of Montaigne reflects the quickened time-sense of the age
- |2
                      that now found essays and short novellas more congenial fare than long
- |2
                      accretions. But it was in the developed drama with its possibilities for
- |2
                      the simultaneous presentation of multiple relationships and causal
- |2
                      connections that the eclecticism and the ambiguities of an open world
- |2
                      were best expressed.
- |2
                  No treatment of ambiguity can avoid the problem of Hamlet, since for so many both character and play have become
- |2
                      synonymous with the term. But some of the problems are the invention of
- |2
                      modern critics, dat- ing no earlier than the
- |2
                      advent of the proscenium stage which introduced not only a different
- |2
                      theater but also a different technique of interpreting drama. The mul- tiple playing areas of the Elizabethan
- |2
                      stage, simulta- neous action, multiple
- |2
                      motives, and the several levels055
- |2
                       of reality that are the bases of Shakespearean drama- turgy were flattened out by the
- |2
                      box-stage, realistic decor, and notions of verisimilitude and linear progres- sion of action that characterize the
- |2
                      novels of Zola. Therefore the delight of the critic in the
- |2
                      multivalence of Hamlet's madness, or speculation on the motives for
- |2
                      the delay in revenge are false problems; Hamlet is under palace arrest, and
- |2
                      only by his assumed antic disposition (plan known to Horatio) does he have
- |2
                          li- cense to prowl and to spy.
- |2
                  The genuine ambiguities have to do with the ideas explored by Shakespeare,
- |2
                      and with the structure and scope of the play. First, revenge is throughout
- |2
                          Shake- speare a negative term, at best
- |2
                      what Francis Bacon calls “a kind of wild justice, which the more
- |2
                      man's nature runs to, the more ought law to weed it out.”
- |2
                      Whether Shakespeare meant to say that revenge is acceptable when purged of
- |2
                      passion and executed more in sorrow than in anger, or whether revenge is
- |2
                      all that remains of justice when the times are out of joint must
- |2
                      remain a moot point. Secondly, two notions of kingship are present in the
- |2
                      play: on the political level, Den- mark's
- |2
                      kings are elected; on the theological level suc-
- |2
                          cession of reigns and of dynasties are foreordained by God.
- |2
                      Thus, upon his providential return to Denmark, after Hamlet has proof of
- |2
                      Claudius' guilt and the assur- ance that he is
- |2
                      God's chosen instrument, he announces his royal pretension with
- |2
                      “I, Hamlet the Dane.” Later, in reviewing with
- |2
                      Horatio the evidence against Claudius, he declares that “the
- |2
                      interim is mine,” sug- gesting
- |2
                      that the eldest crime has made invalid the present reign. Hamlet,
- |2
                      therefore, is his father's succes- sor, the
- |2
                      purpose of his uncrowned rule to bring to an end a dynasty and his own life
- |2
                      which are parts of the general rottenness of Denmark. Hamlet thus is
- |2
                      both scourge of God and victim whose double role in life requires
- |2
                      premeditation of all action to prevent the tainting of his mind, that
- |2
                      purity rewarded in death by an apotheosis hymned by flights of angels.
- |2
                  But death for the other characters is also a con-
- |2
                          summation, the manner of their dying indicating, but not
- |2
                      revealing entirely, the ambiguous connection be-
- |2
                      tween the actualization of God's will that is provi- dence, and justice on earth. Among the problems
- |2
                      that Hamlet ponders therefore are the purposes of knowl- edge, the limits of reason, and God's will. But ulti- mately all attempts at the capturing of
- |2
                      God's mind are not only vain but blasphemous; therefore augury must be
- |2
                      defied, and like the fallen sparrow man is God's captive, nescience
- |2
                      reason's response to omniscience, and readiness the proper state of the
- |2
                      will in relation to providence.
- |2
                  The historical setting and the scope of the play are impossible to
- |2
                      determine, since on the one hand the
- |2
                       ostensible reason for dispatching Hamlet to England is for the
- |2
                      collection of the Danegeld (ca. ninth century); on the other hand, he is a
- |2
                      student at Wittenberg which was founded in 1502, but which did not enjoy a
- |2
                      foreign reputation until Shakespeare's day. Obviously anach- ronism is present, but the usual
- |2
                      function of collapsing time does not seem to apply. In Hamlet the author's motive appears to be the opposite: the
- |2
                      extension of Danish and English history centuries beyond the two
- |2
                      months required by the action. Similarly, the dramatic structure,
- |2
                      “all beginning,” becomes appropriate when it is
- |2
                      perceived that Shakespeare was experimenting with the hero in posse, a risky artistic challenge that requires
- |2
                      the identification of an adolescent protagonist with his potentialities
- |2
                      rather than with his achieve- ments, with
- |2
                          becoming rather than with being: “For he was likely, had he been put on, to have
- |2
                      prov'd most royal.”
- |2
                  Technically, Shakespeare had to negotiate the con-
- |2
                          stant shift in focus from the drama on the stage to the drama
- |2
                      within Hamlet's inexperienced but learning mind by regularly suspending the
- |2
                      action with an ab- normal number of
- |2
                      internalizing soliloquies. That Shakespeare thought he succeeded in his
- |2
                      attempts may be seen in Fortinbras' epilogue, for when the poet feels
- |2
                      secure in his accomplishment he characteristically vio- lates the illusion he has created in order to reveal
- |2
                      his hand as creator. As for the meaning of so protean a play, the
- |2
                      history of Hamlet criticism parodies Polonius'
- |2
                      response to cloud formations, the various inter- pretations placed upon Hamlet's antic disposition
- |2
                      by the other characters, and their various reactions to the play
- |2
                      within the play—all these examples anticipating the Rorschach
- |2
                      Test (1923) which is based upon the interpretation of an articulate but
- |2
                      amorphous shape that elicits self-revealing commentary. The work is
- |2
                      therefore informed with its own literary criticism, including the tacit
- |2
                      assertion that works of art may be exercises in criticism as well as
- |2
                      creation, endeavors always subject to the fashions of the day. The explicit- ness of this awareness Shakespeare
- |2
                      reserved for his Cleopatra (Antony and Cleopatra, V,
- |2
                      ii):
- "                \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          The quick comediansExtemporally will stage us and presentOur Alexandrian revels. AntonyShall be brought drunken forth, and I shall seeSome squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatnessI'th' posture of a whore.
- "                \n"
- |2
                  But the poet's desire to free his work from himself and from Time is also
- |2
                      present in Hamlet, for the play concludes with an
- |2
                      infinite regress. Horatio offers to follow his prince in death, but his
- |2
                      duties are not yet over. He is not only to report Hamlet's cause aright056
- |2
                       to the unsatisfied, but also, in this harsh world, to draw his
- |2
                      breath in pain “to tell my story.” Because Shake- speare's Hamlet is not the Hamlet of
- |2
                      saga, chronicle, romance, or other dramatic presentations, telling the
- |2
                      story aright requires returning to the beginning, da
- |2
                          capo, and re-experiencing the play, a simple form of regress
- |2
                      that was a familiar device in music.

- |2
                          2. The Autonomy of Art and Self-Reference.
- |2
                       The multivocality of Shakespearean drama that conceals the
- |2
                      author's point of view finds its counterpart in painting with Leonardo's
- |2
                      invention of sfumato. This shading and blurring of
- |2
                      outline in combination with the disjunctive background explains the
- |2
                      enigmatic quality of the Mona Lisa (E. H. Gombrich, The
- |2
                          Story of Art, 9th ed. [1958]). A comparison of her smile with
- |2
                      that of the Virgin of Notre Dame described above reveals the historic
- |2
                      changes in artistic aims, since re- peated
- |2
                      viewings of the medieval statue will add noth-
- |2
                      ing to the doctrinal ambiguities once they are per- ceived, for the work, like the church's sacraments,
- |2
                      was no more than a visible sign for a reality that existed elsewhere.
- |2
                      But in the case of Leonardo it is precisely the repeated viewings that
- |2
                      convince the beholder that her expressions change. Because the moods of
- |2
                      the beholder that are read into the picture are ipso
- |2
                          facto
- |2
                       valid, viewing the Mona Lisa becomes a continuous process of
- |2
                      collaborative recreation. Thus the roles of artist and audience are
- |2
                      temporally reversed, and the question of who is who and what is what
- |2
                      remains an open one. This problem was made the subject of a painting
- |2
                      by Vermeer (Figure 1).
- |2
                  The original title of “An Artist in His Studio” was
- |2
                      “The Painter's Art” (Lawrence Gowing, Vermeer [1952]) which tells us a great deal more about the
- |2
                      meaning of the work. Vermeer has depicted an artist painting from a human
- |2
                      model costumed and furnished with the trumpet of fame, the book of history,
- |2
                      and the crown of immortality. But a number of questions are raised in
- |2
                      the viewer's mind. First, the imper-
- |2
                      sonation of Immortality, whether it can be done, and what reality
- |2
                      there is in the artist's portrait of her. It has therefore been conjectured
- |2
                      that the artist was painting Hope although his model represented
- |2
                      another figure. Secondly, the causal connection between fame and the
- |2
                      artist's work have been reversed, for fame is a by-product of, not the
- |2
                      subject of a painting.
- |2
                  But more importantly, who is the artist? The identity of the painter
- |2
                      depicted by Vermeer is concealed from the viewer since he is seen only from
- |2
                      the back. And when one steps outside the frame of the canvas, the same
- |2
                      question is posed in a different context, for the beholder is standing
- |2
                      where Vermeer must have stood as he painted the picture. While this last
- |2
                      point may be made of all easel paintings, it has special relevance to
- |2
                      this particular work because of the subject and its treatment. On the left
- |2
                      side of the canvas is part of a tapestry painted to look as though it might
- |2
                      have been hanging over the canvas itself. But an equally possible
- |2
                      interpretation is that it hangs in the doorway that separates two rooms. In
- |2
                      either case it is pulled back to reveal an artist in his
- |2
                      studio—or, “An Artist in His Studio.”
- |2
                      Whosesoever the hand that pulls back the tapestry to reveal the painter
- |2
                      painting, the viewer is permitted an insight into the creative process
- |2
                      itself, the most secret of mysteries. Yet at the same time it is also
- |2
                      public and cosmic, for fame is the judgment of the world, but the
- |2
                      governance of the world may be providential or entirely fortuitous, an
- |2
                      historical accident.
- |2
                  What then is the “subject” of this painting whose
- |2
                      surface lucidity, explicitness of detail, and quietness of statement
- |2
                      conceal as many ambiguities as the beholder can think up? It is astonishing
- |2
                      that something originat- ing in so small and
- |2
                      contained an area as a narrow Dutch room can have such wide application.
- |2
                      But to say that an event “originates” in a specific
- |2
                      place is to make an arbitrary decision, for within the context of the
- |2
                      assumptions implicit in the painting, this need not be the case. If no
- |2
                      limits of inference are set and if the057
- |2
                       categories of causal relations are placed in doubt, each detail
- |2
                      in the painting may at the same time be both cause and effect. Moreover,
- |2
                      the abstraction that is Fame and the anonymity of the artist depicted
- |2
                      place them in the category of common, not proper nouns. Consequently
- |2
                      it may be surmised that Vermeer was handling abstractions that touch upon
- |2
                      communication and the human understanding, both within the self and
- |2
                      the public at large; that Vermeer was analyzing the interpenetration of
- |2
                      working, thinking, and creating, as well as the possibility of an almost
- |2
                      infinite succession of appreciation. That Vermeer's legal executor was
- |2
                      the pioneer microbiologist Leeuwenhoek, famous for his microscopes, is
- |2
                      perhaps not without significance.
- |2
                  The self-reference in a painting about painting was an acknowledgment of the
- |2
                      disappearance of traditional content from art. When secularization also
- |2
                      came to music, it had certain natural advantages that perhaps explains
- |2
                      its ascendancy in the eighteenth century. Divorced from reference to the
- |2
                      outside world, it be- came not only the most
- |2
                      abstract and formal of the arts, but also a language without a subject. Or,
- |2
                      stated in another way, it became the subject of its own discourse.
- |2
                      Thus when the composers turned their attention to the exploration of formal
- |2
                      patterns their realization that reiteration was the only referential mode
- |2
                      available to this kind of music prompted them to explore the ambi- guities intrinsic to any melody. The
- |2
                      pleasure they derived in contriving these excursions is recorded by
- |2
                      the number and extent of variations upon themes, whether their own or those
- |2
                      of others, for such exercises could be cast as independent works, as are
- |2
                      the Goldberg Variations of Bach, or as part of a
- |2
                      larger work. Because the point about themes and variations can most conve- niently be made by the simplest of
- |2
                      examples, we choose the second movement of Haydn's G Major Symphony No. 94, the
- |2
                      “Surprise,” one of the twelve he composed for the
- |2
                      London season of 1792. In it Haydn projected a series of physical postures,
- |2
                      psychological states, and courtly ceremonies that concluded in the
- |2
                      genial nescience of a quiddity: What is a tune? For the oddity of
- |2
                      reiterative utterances is that through repetition the original statement is
- |2
                      both strengthened and under- mined, and
- |2
                      credence in its validity is progressively obliterated into nonexisten

                      This bias against the presence of two or more meanings in any
- |2
                      statement reflects the general bias of the civilization which traditionally
- |2
                      from Classical Greek times has placed its faith in reason and an orderly
- |2
                      universe—a civilization which, by extension, has operated on a
- |2
                      tacit belief in the reliability of the reasoning process and its
- |2
                      correspondence with external reality. Consequently men for centuries did
- |2
                      not question the relationship between words and things, and were able to
- |2
                      assume that no responsible statement could contradict anyNevertheless, in spite of this general prejudice against confusing or
- |2
                      misleading statements, certain kinds of ambiguous utterances were
- |2
                      acceptable to the ancient Greeks. The earliest examples of these ambig- uities are sub-literary and are cast in
- |2
                      forms that still reflect the primitive faith in a world that contains
- |2
                      precise answers to all questions. Oracular utterances emanating from holy
- |2
                      places presupposed the accuracy of the priestess's veiled message, since it
- |2
                      was the voice of God that spoke through her. Because the passive role
- |2
                      of medium did not include comprehension, eluci-
- |2
                          dation for the priestess as well as the petitioner came with the
- |2
                      passage of time. With arcane formulae and recipes the speaker assumed an
- |2
                      active role—curses, spells, charms, and ritual signs and dances
- |2
                      being early examples of human attempts to control external events
- |2
                      through empirical means. The body of knowledge behind these practical
- |2
                      skills was invariably recorded in symbolic language, but the obscurity of
- |2
                      this form of technical jargon could have been ambiguous only to the
- |2
                      non-initiates of occult fraternities.Closer to art in our sense of the word are riddles which are
- |2
                      self-annihilating word games, a form of social entertainment that also
- |2
                      presupposes the existence of precise answers to questions, but which
- |2
                      require the agency of interlocutor and respondee to complete the
- |2
                      process: riddles cease to exist when the meaning is discovered. The
- |2
                      contrivance of an endpoint of only one possible answer or meaning
- |2
                      differentiates riddles from enigmas, myths, and genuine works of art for
- |2
                      which there are no determinable endpoints of contemplation. Ambiguity
- |2
                      as an aesthetic principle emerged therefore when artists deliberately
- |2
                      contrived complex structures that generated a plurality of meanings.In Greek literature it was the mantic Pindar who modified the oracular
- |2
                      tradition for artistic purposes. In the Hymn to Zeus
- |2
                      (only fragments of which have survived) God announces that no beauty is
- |2
                      complete without praise. By inference, therefore, the poet's sta- tus was holy and his function was to

                      celebrate. But what Pindar was celebrating in his hymns of victory for
- |2
                      athletes, and why the odes are apparently lacking in unity constitute an
- |2
                      enigma. While there is no mys- tery as to to
- |2
                      whom the
- |2
                      ἐπινίκια
- |2
                      were addressed, there is ambiguity as to the true subject of the poems.
- |2
                          More- over the praises characteristically
- |2
                      open brilliantly, as
- |2
                       all readers have remarked, but trail off and merely stop, a
- |2
                      criticism that may not be relevant to works meant to be orchestrated and
- |2
                      choreographed. Nevertheless the structural peculiarities may point to
- |2
                      another level of meaning if the poems are accepted as Pindar's records
- |2
                      of theophanies that occurred at religious games, an institution that was
- |2
                      more ancient than Homer and the Trojan War. Traditionally, the arena
- |2
                      in which the contest took place was sacred ground, the athletic event an
- |2
                          agon, and the victory a kairos that transformed the contestant into a hero, a term
- |2
                      originally applied only to the dead, but progressively applied to the
- |2
                      living.This cultural change created a third, ambiguous middle zone between the
- |2
                      natural and supernatural worlds, in metaphysical terms a new ontological
- |2
                          cate- gory to which the living aspired.
- |2
                      Through excellence which led to transcendence, the presence of the
- |2
                      gods could be summoned to this juncture between two worlds. Victory
- |2
                      conferred therefore a multivalent status upon the hero, the attainment of a
- |2
                      more complete state of being poised between time and eternity. But the
- |2
                      duration of this achievement was also ambiguous, since on the level of
- |2
                      actuality the victory won by the indi- vidual
- |2
                      could be lost at the next festival. It is likely, therefore, that the
- |2
                      poet's solution to this cultural para- dox was
- |2
                      the juxtaposition of his favorite images in the context of an amorphous
- |2
                      structure: gold representing the permanence of the state of pure being;
- |2
                      light repre- senting the incandescent
- |2
                      moment of victory when the hero became a presence, its occurrence a
- |2
                      metaphor for the process of heroization, and its visible behavior
- |2
                      mysterious and of short duration. The waning structure of the Pindarics may
- |2
                      allude therefore to metaphysical problems that had no solutions, problems
- |2
                      that in a prelogical age could be expressed only in mythopoeic terms.The traditional practice of classifying according to the place of the
- |2
                      festival might have been consonant with Pindar's intention, for if the
- |2
                      poems were records of theophanies, where they occurred was more impor- tant than other considerations. The Olympia I, in Richmond Lattimore's translation, begins:Water is the best of all things if usefulness is the criterion, but it
- |2
                          is too humble and ordinary to attract attention. Gold, on the other
- |2
                          hand, not only has the appearance of excellence but is in fact more
- |2
                          valuable than other metals. But better than either of these is my ode
- |2
                          composed at Olympia, sacred to Zeus, and occasioned by the victory of
- |2
                          Syracusan Hieron....That this univocal lucidity was achieved by limiting meanings either by
- |2
                      amplification or its opposites, com-
- |2
                      pression or suppression, reveals something of the aims and
- |2
                      techniques of Pindar. A multivalenced reading might superimpose upon the
- |2
                      prose version the follow- ing:Water is the best of all things because it supports life which is the
- |2
                          best of all things. But what is best in the world of nature is not best
- |2
                          in the metaphysical realm, since the gold of pure being outshines the
- |2
                          earthly fame that adheres to the possessors of great wealth. But I am a
- |2
                          poet, and poetry is of this world. Therefore in the search for subjects
- |2
                          I look no further than the visible world, but choose excellence.
- |2
                          The sun has no rivals for brilliance by day, Olympia—sacred
- |2
                          to the son of Kronos—none for antiquity and dignity....Pindar has contrived different levels of reality with different criteria of
- |2
                      excellence through the use of gnomic opening, riddle, paradox, symbol,
- |2
                      myth, and a multiplicity of meanings through overlapping cate- gories. Moreover, suppressed information
- |2
                      that must be inferred is not only technique but meaning in poems that
- |2
                      both celebrate and are theophanies. Olympia is compared to the sun that
- |2
                      makes invisible lesser stars. That Pythia, Isthmia, and Nemea are not
- |2
                      mentioned may be more than tact. Also, the term “Son of
- |2
                      Kronos” is not only traditional formula, but a way of
- |2
                      evoking both gods for the purpose of opposing Time with Permanence if
- |2
                      the self-manifestation of Zeus is the true subject of the poem. Standing,
- |2
                      as it were, historically between Mycenae and Athens, and artistically
- |2
                      between temple and hippodrome, the Theban Pindar in life was awarded
- |2
                      the right to an equal share of first-fruit offer-
- |2
                          ings by the Pythian priestess of Delphi, and after death,
- |2
                      heroization, his ghost being invited annually to dine with Apollo (Gilbert
- |2
                      Norwood, Pindar [1945]). But religious games,
- |2
                      Thebes, and Pindar were all anachro- nisms
- |2
                      in the light of world history, for the political reality of the expansion
- |2
                      of the Persian Empire and the need for a Greek response gave the leadership
- |2
                      of that civilization to Athens.The rapidity of change that accounts for the ultimate displacement of the
- |2
                      arts in Athens also explains the ascendance of drama over lyric in the
- |2
                      early stages of this process. For, according to John H. Finley, Jr.,
- |2
                      Aeschylus was “the inventor of the idea of meaningful
- |2
                       time” (Pindar and Aeschylus
- |2
                      [1955]). But the optimistic view of history presented in Aeschylus' Oresteia gave way to the inconclusive debate in
- |2
                      Sophocles' Antigone, and to the doubts raised as to
- |2
                      the ambiguous benefits of language in Euripides' Hippolytus, for the cultural relativity introduced by the
- |2
                      Sophists had challenged not only the traditional content of the arts, but
- |2
                      the connection between words and things, as well. Thus on the one hand
- |2
                      Aristophanes complained that “They have dethroned Zeus, and
- |2
                      Vortex is King” (Georgio di Santillana, The
- |2
                          Origins of Scientific Thought [1961]). On the other hand, the new
- |2
                      status of language as reasoning instrument made words the domain of crea- tors of systems: the scientists,
- |2
                      philosophers, and histo- rians in whom the
- |2
                      tacit faith of the dramatists was continued. Their assertion of the
- |2
                      inevitability of conse- quences from acts
- |2
                      knowingly or unwittingly committed was abstracted as the uniformity of
- |2
                      nature's laws which could be discovered by following the laws of logic.
- |2
                      For the rationalists, therefore, ambiguity was neither thing nor
- |2
                      principle, but a phase in the reasoning process between perception and
- |2
                      knowledge. But the history of this movement was also one of degeneration,
- |2
                      since “Men seemed to be capable of sacrificing the Law of
- |2
                      Contradiction for the sake of comfort” (George Boas,Rationalism in Greek Philosophy [1961]).The history of rationalism parallels the story of introspection and the
- |2
                      discovery of the self. The reduc- tion of the
- |2
                      wealth of Homeric terms for what subse-
- |2
                      quently were the simplified categories of “body”
- |2
                      and “soul” reveals the metamorphosis of the
- |2
                      conception of man from aggregate to unit, a change confirmed in art by
- |2
                      the abandonment of the geometric style of the late archaic period (Bruno
- |2
                      Snell, The Discovery of the Mind: The Greek Origins of
- |2
                          European Thought [1953]). This unification through simplification
- |2
                          pro- duced at the same time a common
- |2
                      denominator that could be projected either as causal nexus or as focus
- |2
                      of interest for artistic purposes. The failure of Greek politics thus gave
- |2
                      a new direction to the arts in the Greco-Roman period (Moses Hadas, Hellenistic Cul- ture: Fusion
- |2
                          and Diffusion [1959]). The emergence of the spiritual landscape of
- |2
                      the pastoral lyric asserted the validity of the private and subjective
- |2
                      world; the improbable world of the romances proclaimed at the same
- |2
                      time the unpredictability of Fortune and a faith in an incomprehensible but
- |2
                      benign Providence; and the composition of spiritual biographies called
- |2
                      aretologies that transformed moral teachers into cult
- |2
                      figures—all point to the kind of consolation men sought.Nevertheless, after Aristotle, literary works ad-
- |2
                          dressed to the reason as well as to the sentiments were subject
- |2
                      to more stringent standards of consistency, hence the criticism of Vergil's
- |2
                          Aeneid that persists to this day. Apparently in
- |2
                      the cultural climate of his time,And when Anchises had led his son over every scene, and fired his soul
- |2
                          with love of fame that was to be, he tells him then of the wars he must
- |2
                          thereafter wage, and instructs him of the Laurentine peoples and the
- |2
                          city of Latinus and how he is to flee or face each toil.Two gates of Sleep there are, whereof the one is said to be of horn, and
- |2
                          thereby an easy outlet is given to true shades; the other gleaming with
- |2
                          the sheen of polished ivory, but false are the dreams sent by the
- |2
                          spirits to the world above. There then with these words Anchises
- |2
                          attends both his son and the Sibyl, and dismisses them by the ivory
- |2
                          gate.Because this episode is pivotal, its interpretation will determine the
- |2
                      meaning of the whole work. The easiest solution is to conjecture a mistake
- |2
                      on the part of the author. The principle of durior
- |2
                          lectio, on the other hand, requires a reading of the text as
- |2
                      it stands. Clearly Aeneas and the Sibyl have made their exit from the
- |2
                      wrong gate if the world of political Rome is not to be dismissed as a vain
- |2
                      dream; alternatively if the reality of Rome is asserted, Aeneas himself is
- |2
                      a false dream. Thus the Law of Contradiction is evoked, and as the two
- |2
                      halves of the epic seem mutually exclusive, cen-
- |2
                          turies of readers have in effect discarded the last six books.
- |2
                      It is likely, however, that the poet was in fact asserting both worlds but
- |2
                      could find no satisfactory solution to his problem. The characterization of
- |2
                      his eponymous hero as “pious” was Vergil's way of
- |2
                      making him both historical founder and presiding genius of city and
- |2
                      empire. Whereas the fusion of two roles in one character succeeded, the
- |2
                      work as a whole did not, and the poet's instruction in his will that the
- |2
                      epic be de- stroyed may be interpreted as the
- |2
                      recognition of his failure to reconcile the ideas of history and
- |2
                      eternity, a conjecture made more probable by the fact that Vergil died
- |2
                      in Greece while revising the Aeneid. The precise
- |2
                      destination of Vergil's cultural pilgrimage is unknown, but it was at
- |2
                      Alexandria, through Philo's multileveled but unified interpretation of
- |2
                      sacred his- tory, that a solution was found.
- |2
                      Philo's elaborate rami- fications of the
- |2
                      allegorical method are, therefore, the first critical treatises on one,
- |2
                      perhaps the most rational, type of ambiguity.Among the backgrounds to the solution of this two-
- |2
                      fold problem was typology, a chronological projection
- |2
                       of allegory that was one of the several innovations of the Old
- |2
                      Testament Prophets. Responding to the imme-
- |2
                      diate political needs of a threatened Judea, their messi- anic message fused policy with prophecy by
- |2
                      historical analogy. The recurrent cycle of slavery and deliverance
- |2
                      encouraged faith in a redeemer; therefore some of these leaders saw their
- |2
                      lives as both fact and symbol: they were “types” of
- |2
                      Moses and Messiah, intermediary fig- ures that
- |2
                      recapitulated past events while prophetically living the future. And by
- |2
                      generalizing and extending in both directions it was possible to join
- |2
                      together the end of history with its beginning, erasing the
- |2
                      distinction between prophecy and apocalypse; thus for Isaiah, the
- |2
                      Messiah that he prophesied was to be another Adam in another Paradise:And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse.... And
- |2
                              righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness
- |2
                              the girdle of his reins. The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb,
- |2
                              and the leopard shall lie down with the kid.... And the lion shall
- |2
                              eat straw like the ox
- |2
                          (Isaiah 11:1, 5-7).
- |2
                      Isaiah's inclusion of a genealogy was an expression of faith in the
- |2
                      continuity of history, even as his projec-
- |2
                      tion of a Messiah documented the need for a cult figure (as
- |2
                      alternative to relapse into idolatry) to focus the aspirations of a people
- |2
                      in troubled times. Centuries later the selection of Jesus as the announced
- |2
                      Second Adam gave to his followers a fixed point for their
- |2
                      interpretation of history, and Moses was then reduced to a
- |2
                      “type” who prefigured the Christ in whom the Law and
- |2
                      the Prophetic promises were fulfilled. Alle-
- |2
                      gory became therefore an indispensable tool for this new religion
- |2
                      with evangelical and universalist aims.The Prophetic interpretation of political events constituted in effect the
- |2
                      invention of world history. And because history was the revealed will of
- |2
                      God, approved records of the past were subsequently organized into a
- |2
                      canon and elevated to the status of Scripture. The transcendence implied by
- |2
                      this new category of writing produced therefore works in Greco-Roman times
- |2
                      that took on the character of vulgate romances with apocry- phal additions. The linear projection of history
- |2
                      was now abandoned in favor of a single character who anachronistically
- |2
                      embodied the past and future experi- ence of
- |2
                      the people. But world history could also be projected in this fashion, as
- |2

                      being the millenium. The author of the Book of Daniel (a figure unrecorded

- |2
                      a “myth” of the Old Testament as nucleus to a story

                      intended to encourage the people persecutedThe allegorization that unified the Old and New Testaments for the
- |2
                      Christians also transformed their Bible into a universal history; therefore
- |2
                      the word alle- gory acquired a new meaning. For
- |2
                      the Greek ration- alists, allegory referred
- |2
                      merely to a figurative use of language—in short, a fiction. But
- |2
                      for the Christians symbols were nothing less than visible signs of the
- |2
                      Truth they were instructed to propagate universally. In the resulting
- |2
                      conflicts the production of apologies in response to attacks progressively
- |2
                      clarified doctrine and assumptions (Claude Tresmontant, La Métaphy- sique du

- |2
                      chrétienne [1961]) that later received systematic treat- ment (Étienne Gilson, La Philosophie au Moyen Age [1952]).But it was on the level of sentiment that the appeal of Christianity lay,
- |2
                      since the pessimism inherent in the Greek cyclical notion of history, and
- |2
                      its counterpart for the individual, endless reincarnation in an un- changing world governed by eternal
- |2
                      laws—could not compete against a religion that recognized the
- |2
                          individ- ual soul and offered a personal
- |2
                      redeemer, a compas- sionate God, and a
- |2
                      progressive, meaningful world his- tory. The
- |2
                      conversion of Constantine that automatically made Christianity the official
- |2
                      religion of the empire, and the expansion of the Church's boundaries as
- |2
                      other forms of rule failed marked the extent and degree of this
- |2
                      cultural revolution. According to Erwin Panofsky, (Gothic
- |2
                          Architecture and Scholasticism [1951], pp. 3, 4):To the Carolingian revival of the arts there corresponds, in philosophy,
- |2
                          the phenomenon of John the Scot, equally magnificent, equally
- |2
                          unexpected.... About a hundred years of fermentation in both fields
- |2
                          were followed, in art,
- |2
                           by a variety and contrariety of Romanesque... and, in
- |2
                          theology and philosophy, by a similar multiplicity of diver- gent currents, from uncompromising fideism and
- |2
                          ruthless rationalism to the proto-humanism of... the school of
- |2
                          Chartres.The allegory, analogy, and symbolism that charac-
- |2
                          terized medieval thought was the very foundation of the Gothic
- |2
                      church, beginning with the cruciform groundplan and the general orientation
- |2
                      of the struc- ture. The common supposition
- |2
                      that everything visible was a symbol led William Durandus, the thirteenth- century Bishop of Mende, to
- |2
                      compile and invent in his Rationale divinorum
- |2
                          officiorum layer upon layer of meaning to every detail of
- |2
                      church, ornaments, rites, and ceremonies. Thus the foundation of the
- |2
                      church represented Faith; the roof Charity, because it covered a
- |2
                      multitude of sins; the door, Obedience—“If thou wilt
- |2
                      enter into life, keep the Commandments” (Matthew 19:17).
- |2
                      Moreover, the sacristy symbolized the womb of the Virgin Mary where Christ
- |2
                      put on his humanity, since that was where the priests, his
- |2
                      representatives on earth, put on their robes.Because the main entrance to the church, the west door, faced the material
- |2
                      world from which the laity came to worship, church facades became visual
- |2
                          syn- opses of theology, and in some
- |2
                      instances the anonymous artists found ways to represent doctrinal
- |2
                      ambiguities. Among the statues and the high relief carvings that make
- |2
                      up the facade of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris is a standing niche
- |2
                      figure of the Virgin Mary, heavy with Child. What distinguishes this work
- |2
                      from others that serve a similar architectural function (Adolf
- |2
                      Katzenellenbogen, The Sculptural Programs of Chartres
- |2
                          Cathedral: Christ-Mary-Ecclesia [1959]) is the series of choices
- |2
                      the artist made. Like his contemporaries, in his wish to recall an event in
- |2
                      Time and to evoke its Eternal meaning he engaged in deliberate
- |2
                      anachronism, for his Virgin is not yet the Mother of Jesus; never- theless she is already crowned the
- |2
                      Queen of Heaven. But beyond these conventional details is the more
- |2
                      significant combination of the Virgin's enigmatic smile and the gesture of
- |2
                      her hands, arrested in mid-motion. The viewer is uncertain whether she
- |2
                          (Figlia del tuo Figlio) is blessing the
- |2
                      Fruit of her Womb or whether she is praying to the Eternal God. The
- |2
                      ambiguity in the intent of her gesture reflected that of her status,
- |2
                      for on the one hand the doctrine of Christ's humanity allowed one to
- |2
                      believe that a dutiful Son would be obedient to the wishes of his Mother.
- |2
                      On the other, it was also held that the Incarnation was the greatest
- |2
                      indignity suffered by God—in which case the status of the Virgin
- |2
                      was merely that of the Chosen Vessel which gave her a place of honor but
- |2
                      not necessarily any authority in heaven. Consequently both rank andOn the practical level the wish of the Church on Earth to be in accord with
- |2
                      the one in Heaven raised questions touching upon the validity of
- |2
                      unauthorized modes of worship. It is probable that the influence of
- |2
                      Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, the Marian Doctor, en-
- |2
                          couraged the church's toleration of this form of idolatry as
- |2
                      counter-measure against the growing popularity of the secular cult of the
- |2
                      Lady, no longer obscurely deified in trobar
- |2
                      clus, but openly in the vernacular romances (Maurice Valency, In Praise of Love [1958]). The ambiguities that
- |2
                      surround the statue in question stem from the authoritative statement of
- |2
                      doctrine, the Creed, which remains officially a Mystery even today.
- |2
                      The implications of a triune God, his dual nature, and the manner of his
- |2
                      birth challenged the artist to present a mind in tacit play with
- |2
                      unanswerable questions of faith inherent in the figures, both depicted and
- |2
                          con- cealed.The economic recovery of Europe that permitted the building of cathedrals
- |2
                      also formalized education institutionally (Charles Homer Haskins, The Renais- sance of the
- |2
                          12th Century [1927]) a fact that may explain the shift from
- |2
                      positive to systematic theology. But the pedagogue's shift of focus from a
- |2
                      theory of knowledge to a theory of learning led not only to a
- |2
                      reclassification of things according to theoretical, practical, mechanical,
- |2
                      and logical categories, but to empiricism, as well. Consequently in their
- |2
                          theolog- ical-aesthetic
- |2
                      didascalica they were natural theologians who
- |2
                      believed that the Creator could best be understood by his Creation, and
- |2
                      thereby gave an impetus to the study of the world of things.They were also mystical theologians who thought in terms of a sequence of
- |2
                      experience out of which knowledge was to be derived for the unification
- |2
                      of man's mind with that of God. Hence the structural metaphor of the
- |2
                      voyage for Saint Bonaventure's Itiner- arium, the nuptial metaphor in Hugh of Saint Victor'sDe arraha animae, and the figure of Jacob in theBenjamin Minor of the later Victorine, Richard. For
- |2
                      Richard, man's ascent from earth to heaven by means of the mystical ladder
- |2
                      was premiss and conclusion. What he analyzed was each episode of Jacob's
- |2
                      life as aspects—ways of seeing and interpreting—of
- |2
                      the ulti- mate unity of things that was implied
- |2
                      by the one- ness of God. The two wives of Jacob
- |2
                      served therefore two functions of as many views of the subject
- |2
                      “Man” as the author cared to contemplate. The fer- tility of Leah and the sterility of Rachel,
- |2
                      on one level, were interpreted as the appetites of the mind (Richard of Saint Victor, ed. and trans. Clare Kirch- berger [1957], p. 91): For as it is Leah's part to love since she is the affection of the
- |2
                          soul, so it is Rachel's part to know, for she is reason. The former
- |2
                          gives birth to ordered affection; the latter to the reason or the pure
- |2
                          intelligence. Judah represents to us... love of the highest good. And
- |2
                          when Judah is born... then Rachel begins to desire children
- |2
                          passionately, for she wants to know. Where love is there is vision...
- |2
                          and certainly he who can love invisible things will immediately
- |2
                          desire to know them and to see them by the intelligence.The canon regulars of Saint Victor (in whose writings are preserved the
- |2
                      earliest systematic treatment of the four-fold interpretation of Scripture:
- |2
                      literal, allegorical, moral, and anagogical) were the ancestors of the
- |2
                      author of the Epistle to Can Grande. But in adapting
- |2
                      this type of multivalenced textual criticism to the Divine Com- edy the author of the
- |2
                      letter (if it was Dante) stipulated only two, the literal and the
- |2
                      unspecified symbolic, ambiguously stating that the work was
- |2
                          “polysemos, hoc est plurium
- |2
                      sensuum,” thus leaving open the question of how many
- |2
                      levels of meaning apply.From a structural point of view the Commedia might
- |2
                      have included a fourth part, since the Christian heaven was located outside
- |2
                      the closed Ptolemaic cosmos. But while staying within this universe, Dante
- |2
                      chose to open up his world conditionally. Consequently the problem
- |2
                      that confronts the reader at the end of Purgatorio
- |2
                      is similar to the pivotal episode in the Aeneid. But
- |2
                      unlike Vergil's disjunctive ambiguity, Dante's Garden of Eden is a
- |2
                      conjunctive symbol, the most complex and open of nexuses in Western
- |2
                      letters. In Eden the pilgrim Dante sees in a vision a giant temporalized
- |2
                      emblem (more complex than Dürer's for the Emperor Maxi- milian I) that is a pageant of the
- |2
                      Church. This allegory has been glossed alternatively as the Church
- |2
                      Militant on earth or the Church Triumphant in Heaven, but the
- |2
                      probability that Dante intended both is made more likely by the location of
- |2
                      this episode in the work. For the purposes of his narrative, from Eden the
- |2
                      pilgrim Dante continued his voyage to God in the Paradiso, but in terms of the meaning of the work, the
- |2
                      untold story of the future of mankind also begins at this point. Thus,
- |2
                      on earth, the closed world of moral categories is obliterated by the
- |2
                      recovery of innocence, and even the memory of past history is washed away
- |2
                      by the waters of Lethe or Divine forgiveness, since Scripture assures
- |2
                      us that “When He forgives He forgets.” This
- |2
                      uncanonical second baptism constitutes therefore a new opportunity for man
- |2
                      under the new dispensation of Christian hedonism. Thus Vergil's valedictory
- |2
                          bene- diction to Dante (Purgatorio, XXVII, 131, 142):... lo tuo piacere omai prendi per duce... per ch'io te sovra te
- |2
                          corono e mitrio (“Now take pleasure as your
- |2
                      guide... [because you are now master of yourself, body and soul,] I
- |2
                      therefore crown and mitre you”).The withdrawal of Vergil as Dante's guide was the poet's way of announcing
- |2
                      the obsolescence of reason as governing principle for human action or
- |2
                      principle of political organization, since the second baptism made
- |2
                      instinctive man's knowledge of natural order, the poet's definition of
- |2
                      Good. His projection of Evil in theInferno recalls therefore the statue in the Book of Daniel, a human anatomy analyzed both
- |2
                      tropologically and chronologically but inverted, its posture repre- senting the stance of sin in relation
- |2
                      to the natural order created by God. Conversely, the figure of
- |2
                      redemption in the Purgatorio is represented upright,
- |2
                      the attainment of the recta ratio by man
- |2
                      paradoxically obliterating his need for it. Consequently the problem that
- |2
                      is raised is the connection in Dante's mind between the ideas of the
- |2
                      possible intellect and plenitude, and what these terms meant to him. In his
- |2
                      political theory, stated in metaphysical terms, Dante was explicit on the
- |2
                      first topic, but not the second (De
- |2
                      Monarchia, trans. H. W. Schneider [1957], p. 6):... since this power can not be completely actualized in a single man or
- |2
                          in any of the particular communi-
- |2
                          ties... there must be a multitude in mankind through whom this
- |2
                          whole power can be actualized; just as there must be a multitude of
- |2
                          created beings to manifest ade- quately
- |2
                          the whole power of prime matter.... With this judgment Averroes agrees
- |2
                          in his commentary on De anima.The cultural rebirth of man announced by Dante was projected two centuries
- |2
                      later as a revolution in education by Rabelais, for whom the exploration of
- |2
                          hu- man possibilities through actualization
- |2
                      automatically meant the rejection of allegory and multiple levels of
- |2
                      reality. He therefore blasted, in the Prologue to the First Book of Gargantua, the tradition that had ex- tended from Philo to his day (trans. J. M. Cohen,
- |2
                      Penguin Classics [1955], p. 38):But do you faithfully believe that Homer, in writing hisIliad and Odyssey, ever had in
- |2
                          mind the allegories squeezed out of him by Plutarch, Heraclides
- |2
                          Ponticus, Eustathius, and Phornutus, and which Politian afterwards
- |2
                          stole from them in his turn? If you do, you are not within a
- |2
                          hand's or a foot's length of my opinion. For I believe them to
- |2
                          have been as little dreamed of by Homer as the Gospel mysteries
- |2
                          were by Ovid in his Metamorphoses; a case which a
- |2
                          certain Friar Lubin, a true bacon-picker, has actually tried to
- |2
                          prove, in the hope that he may meet others as crazy as himself
- |2
                          and—as the proverb says—a lid to fit his kettle.It was not, however, the force of Rabelais' language, but the Scientific
- |2
                      Revolution that destroyed the alle- gorical
- |2
                      method. According to Herbert Butterfield inThe Origins of Modern Science (1957), pp. 7, 8:... it outshines everything since the rise of Christianity and reduces

                           of mere episodes, mere internal displacements, within the

- |2
                          history has become an anachronism and an encumbrance.Accordingly, we will approach the centuries extending from the Florentine
- |2
                      Renaissance to the First World War as a single epoch, tracing the principle
- |2
                      of ambig- uity under three headings, all
- |2
                      ultimately derived from geographical and cosmological exploration.
- |2
                          1. Accidentalism in Open Systems.
- |2
                       The seeming haphazardness of horizontal and open-ended works in
- |2
                      the Renaissance was implicitly a new projection of ambiguity, for the sole
- |2
                      rule of the Abbey of Thélème—Fay ce que vouldras—when translated to
- |2
                      aesthetic principle produced compositions as savory and varie- gated (but unpredictable) as the Adventures of Pan-
- |2
                      tagruel. Adventures, which for other men had led to the
- |2
                      accidental discovery of new continents while merely searching for new ways
- |2
                      of traveling to places long known, thus unwittingly shifted the center of
- |2
                      the world from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, and added impetus to
- |2
                      the nationalism that challenged with a rival theory of sovereignty the
- |2
                      first modern state, the Church. Similarly the faith in the goodness of
- |2
                      instinct that dignified the study of man's actual behavior led to the
- |2
                      discovery of the ego. But because the ambiguities of accidentalism at this
- |2
                      time had to be conceptualized by alternative characterizations of God as
- |2
                      either the rational or the capricious Uncreated Being, the result for
- |2
                      men was fideistic optimism or nescience. Thus Rabelais' optimism shaded
- |2
                      into skepticism for Mon- taigne, since the
- |2
                      purposeless exploration of the inner world of man raised more questions
- |2
                      than he could answer, or that he answered with another question:“Que sçay-je?” This
- |2
                      impatient shrug of Montaigne reflects the quickened time-sense of the age
- |2
                      that now found essays and short novellas more congenial fare than long
- |2
                      accretions. But it was in the developed drama with its possibilities for
- |2
                      the simultaneous presentation of multiple relationships and causal
- |2
                      connections that the eclecticism and the ambiguities of an open world
- |2
                      were best expressed.No treatment of ambiguity can avoid the problem of Hamlet, since for so many both character and play have become
- |2
                      synonymous with the term. But some of the problems are the invention of
- |2
                      modern critics, dat- ing no earlier than the
- |2
                      advent of the proscenium stage which introduced not only a different
- |2
                      theater but also a different technique of interpreting drama. The mul- tiple playing areas of the Elizabethan
- |2
                      stage, simulta- neous action, multiple
- |2
                      motives, and the several levelsThe genuine ambiguities have to do with the ideas explored by Shakespeare,
- |2
                      and with the structure and scope of the play. First, revenge is throughout
- |2
                          Shake- speare a negative term, at best
- |2
                      what Francis Bacon calls “a kind of wild justice, which the more
- |2
                      man's nature runs to, the more ought law to weed it out.”
- |2
                      Whether Shakespeare meant to say that revenge is acceptable when purged of
- |2
                      passion and executed more in sorrow than in anger, or whether revenge is
- |2
                      all that remains of justice when the times are out of joint must
- |2
                      remain a moot point. Secondly, two notions of kingship are present in the
- |2
                      play: on the political level, Den- mark's
- |2
                      kings are elected; on the theological level suc-
- |2
                          cession of reigns and of dynasties are foreordained by God.
- |2
                      Thus, upon his providential return to Denmark, after Hamlet has proof of
- |2
                      Claudius' guilt and the assur- ance that he is
- |2
                      God's chosen instrument, he announces his royal pretension with
- |2
                      “I, Hamlet the Dane.” Later, in reviewing with
- |2
                      Horatio the evidence against Claudius, he declares that “the
- |2
                      interim is mine,” sug- gesting
- |2
                      that the eldest crime has made invalid the present reign. Hamlet,
- |2
                      therefore, is his father's succes- sor, the
- |2
                      purpose of his uncrowned rule to bring to an end a dynasty and his own life
- |2
                      which are parts of the general rottenness of Denmark. Hamlet thus is
- |2
                      both scourge of God and victim whose double role in life requires
- |2
                      premeditation of all action to prevent the tainting of his mind, that
- |2
                      purity rewarded in death by an apotheosis hymned by flights of angels.But death for the other characters is also a con-
- |2
                          summation, the manner of their dying indicating, but not
- |2
                      revealing entirely, the ambiguous connection be-
- |2
                      tween the actualization of God's will that is provi- dence, and justice on earth. Among the problems
- |2
                      that Hamlet ponders therefore are the purposes of knowl- edge, the limits of reason, and God's will. But ulti- mately all attempts at the capturing of
- |2
                      God's mind are not only vain but blasphemous; therefore augury must be
- |2
                      defied, and like the fallen sparrow man is God's captive, nescience
- |2
                      reason's response to omniscience, and readiness the proper state of the
- |2
                      will in relation to providence.The historical setting and the scope of the play are impossible to
- |2
                      determine, since on the one hand the
- |2
                       ostensible reason for dispatching Hamlet to England is for the
- |2
                      collection of the Danegeld (ca. ninth century); on the other hand, he is a
- |2
                      student at Wittenberg which was founded in 1502, but which did not enjoy a
- |2
                      foreign reputation until Shakespeare's day. Obviously anach- ronism is present, but the usual
- |2
                      function of collapsing time does not seem to apply. In Hamlet the author's motive appears to be the opposite: the
- |2
                      extension of Danish and English history centuries beyond the two
- |2
                      months required by the action. Similarly, the dramatic structure,
- |2
                      “all beginning,” becomes appropriate when it is
- |2
                      perceived that Shakespeare was experimenting with the hero in posse, a risky artistic challenge that requires
- |2
                      the identification of an adolescent protagonist with his potentialities
- |2
                      rather than with his achieve- ments, with
- |2
                          becoming rather than with being: “For he was likely, had he been put on, to have
- |2
                      prov'd most royal.”Technically, Shakespeare had to negotiate the con-
- |2
                          stant shift in focus from the drama on the stage to the drama
- |2
                      within Hamlet's inexperienced but learning mind by regularly suspending the
- |2
                      action with an ab- normal number of
- |2
                      internalizing soliloquies. That Shakespeare thought he succeeded in his
- |2
                      attempts may be seen in Fortinbras' epilogue, for when the poet feels
- |2
                      secure in his accomplishment he characteristically vio- lates the illusion he has created in order to reveal
- |2
                      his hand as creator. As for the meaning of so protean a play, the
- |2
                      history of Hamlet criticism parodies Polonius'
- |2
                      response to cloud formations, the various inter- pretations placed upon Hamlet's antic disposition
- |2
                      by the other characters, and their various reactions to the play
- |2
                      within the play—all these examples anticipating the Rorschach
- |2
                      Test (1923) which is based upon the interpretation of an articulate but
- |2
                      amorphous shape that elicits self-revealing commentary. The work is
- |2
                      therefore informed with its own literary criticism, including the tacit
- |2
                      assertion that works of art may be exercises in criticism as well as
- |2
                      creation, endeavors always subject to the fashions of the day. The explicit- ness of this awareness Shakespeare
- |2
                      reserved for his Cleopatra (Antony and Cleopatra, V,
- |2
                      ii):But the poet's desire to free his work from himself and from Time is also
- |2
                      present in Hamlet, for the play concludes with an
- |2
                      infinite regress. Horatio offers to follow his prince in death, but his
- |2
                      duties are not yet over. He is not only to report Hamlet's cause aright
- |2
                          2. The Autonomy of Art and Self-Reference.
- |2
                       The multivocality of Shakespearean drama that conceals the
- |2
                      author's point of view finds its counterpart in painting with Leonardo's
- |2
                      invention of sfumato. This shading and blurring of
- |2
                      outline in combination with the disjunctive background explains the
- |2
                      enigmatic quality of the Mona Lisa (E. H. Gombrich, The
- |2
                          Story of Art, 9th ed. [1958]). A comparison of her smile with
- |2
                      that of the Virgin of Notre Dame described above reveals the historic
- |2
                      changes in artistic aims, since re- peated
- |2
                      viewings of the medieval statue will add noth-
- |2
                      ing to the doctrinal ambiguities once they are per- ceived, for the work, like the church's sacraments,
- |2
                      was no more than a visible sign for a reality that existed elsewhere.
- |2
                      But in the case of Leonardo it is precisely the repeated viewings that
- |2
                      convince the beholder that her expressions change. Because the moods of
- |2
                      the beholder that are read into the picture are ipso
- |2
                          facto
- |2
                       valid, viewing the Mona Lisa becomes a continuous process of
- |2
                      collaborative recreation. Thus the roles of artist and audience are
- |2
                      temporally reversed, and the question of who is who and what is what
- |2
                      remains an open one. This problem was made the subject of a painting
- |2
                      by Vermeer (Figure 1).The original title of “An Artist in His Studio” was
- |2
                      “The Painter's Art” (Lawrence Gowing, Vermeer [1952]) which tells us a great deal more about the
- |2
                      meaning of the work. Vermeer has depicted an artist painting from a human
- |2
                      model costumed and furnished with the trumpet of fame, the book of history,
- |2
                      and the crown of immortality. But a number of questions are raised in
- |2
                      the viewer's mind. First, the imper-
- |2
                      sonation of Immortality, whether it can be done, and what reality
- |2
                      there is in the artist's portrait of her. It has therefore been conjectured
- |2
                      that the artist was painting Hope although his model represented
- |2
                      another figure. Secondly, the causal connection between fame and the
- |2
                      artist's work have been reversed, for fame is a by-product of, not the
- |2
                      subject of a painting.But more importantly, who is the artist? The identity of the painter
- |2
                      depicted by Vermeer is concealed from the viewer since he is seen only from
- |2
                      the back. And when one steps outside the frame of the canvas, the same
- |2
                      question is posed in a different context, for the beholder is standing
- |2
                      where Vermeer must have stood as he painted the picture. While this last
- |2
                      point may be made of all easel paintings, it has special relevance to
- |2
                      this particular work because of the subject and its treatment. On the left
- |2
                      side of the canvas is part of a tapestry painted to look as though it might
- |2
                      have been hanging over the canvas itself. But an equally possible
- |2
                      interpretation is that it hangs in the doorway that separates two rooms. In
- |2
                      either case it is pulled back to reveal an artist in his
- |2
                      studio—or, “An Artist in His Studio.”
- |2
                      Whosesoever the hand that pulls back the tapestry to reveal the painter
- |2
                      painting, the viewer is permitted an insight into the creative process
- |2
                      itself, the most secret of mysteries. Yet at the same time it is also
- |2
                      public and cosmic, for fame is the judgment of the world, but the
- |2
                      governance of the world may be providential or entirely fortuitous, an
- |2
                      historical accident.What then is the “subject” of this painting whose
- |2
                      surface lucidity, explicitness of detail, and quietness of statement
- |2
                      conceal as many ambiguities as the beholder can think up? It is astonishing
- |2
                      that something originat- ing in so small and
- |2
                      contained an area as a narrow Dutch room can have such wide application.
- |2
                      But to say that an event “originates” in a specific
- |2
                      place is to make an arbitrary decision, for within the context of the
- |2
                      assumptions implicit in the painting, this need not be the case. If no
- |2
                      limits of inference are set and if theThe self-reference in a painting about painting was an acknowledgment of the
- |2
                      disappearance of traditional content from art. When secularization also
- |2
                      came to music, it had certain natural advantages that perhaps explains
- |2
                      its ascendancy in the eighteenth century. Divorced from reference to the
- |2
                      outside world, it be- came not only the most
- |2
                      abstract and formal of the arts, but also a language without a subject. Or,
- |2
                      stated in another way, it became the subject of its own discourse.
- |2
                      Thus when the composers turned their attention to the exploration of formal
- |2
                      patterns their realization that reiteration was the only referential mode
- |2
                      available to this kind of music prompted them to explore the ambi- guities intrinsic to any melody. The
- |2
                      pleasure they derived in contriving these excursions is recorded by
- |2
                      the number and extent of variations upon themes, whether their own or those
- |2
                      of others, for such exercises could be cast as independent works, as are
- |2
                      the Goldberg Variations of Bach, or as part of a
- |2
                      larger work. Because the point about themes and variations can most conve- niently be made by the simplest of
- |2
                      examples, we choose the second movement of Haydn's G Major Symphony No. 94, the
- |2
                      “Surprise,” one of the twelve he composed for the
- |2
                      London season of 1792. In it Haydn projected a series of physical postures,
- |2
                      psychological states, and courtly ceremonies that concluded in the
- |2
                      genial nescience of a quiddity: What is a tune? For the oddity of
- |2
                      reiterative utterances is that through repetition the original statement is
- |2
                      both strengthened and under- mined, and
- |2
                      credence in its validity is progressively obliterated into nonexisten

  \               AMBIGUITY ASAESTHETIC PRINCIPLE\n                In Western cultural
  history ambiguity has been a pejorative term until the twentieth century.\n                    This
  bias against the presence of two or more meanings in any\n                    statement
  reflects the general bias of the civilization which traditionally\n                    from
  Classical Greek times has placed its faith in reason and an orderly\n                    universe—a
  civilization which, by extension, has operated on a\n                    tacit belief
  in the reliability of the reasoning process and its\n                    correspondence
  with external reality. Consequently men for centuries did\n                    not
  question the relationship between words and things, and were able to\n                    assume
  that no responsible statement could contradict any049\n                     other,
  that if apparent contradictions emerged in speaking,\n                    clarity
  and coherence, hence truth, could be achieved by amplification.\n                    Thus
  the Greek word for universe\n                    (κόσμος) carried both a\n                    scientific
  and an aes- thetic meaning.\n                    Ambiguity in this cultural context
  represented therefore a failure at\n                    truth, a failure in communication
  attributable either to excessive\n                    brevity, deliberate obscurity
  of phrasing, or to ineptitude.\n                Nevertheless, in spite of this general
  prejudice against confusing or\n                    misleading statements, certain
  kinds of ambiguous utterances were\n                    acceptable to the ancient
  Greeks. The earliest examples of these ambig- uities are sub-literary and are cast
  in\n                    forms that still reflect the primitive faith in a world
  that contains\n                    precise answers to all questions. Oracular utterances
  emanating from holy\n                    places presupposed the accuracy of the
  priestess's veiled message, since it\n                    was the voice of God that
  spoke through her. Because the passive role\n                    of medium did not
  include comprehension, eluci-\n                        dation for the priestess
  as well as the petitioner came with the\n                    passage of time. With
  arcane formulae and recipes the speaker assumed an\n                    active role—curses,
  spells, charms, and ritual signs and dances\n                    being early examples
  of human attempts to control external events\n                    through empirical
  means. The body of knowledge behind these practical\n                    skills
  was invariably recorded in symbolic language, but the obscurity of\n                    this
  form of technical jargon could have been ambiguous only to the\n                    non-initiates
  of occult fraternities.\n                Closer to art in our sense of the word
  are riddles which are\n                    self-annihilating word games, a form
  of social entertainment that also\n                    presupposes the existence
  of precise answers to questions, but which\n                    require the agency
  of interlocutor and respondee to complete the\n                    process: riddles
  cease to exist when the meaning is discovered. The\n                    contrivance
  of an endpoint of only one possible answer or meaning\n                    differentiates
  riddles from enigmas, myths, and genuine works of art for\n                    which
  there are no determinable endpoints of contemplation. Ambiguity\n                    as
  an aesthetic principle emerged therefore when artists deliberately\n                    contrived
  complex structures that generated a plurality of meanings.\n                In Greek
  literature it was the mantic Pindar who modified the oracular\n                    tradition
  for artistic purposes. In the Hymn to Zeus\n                    (only fragments
  of which have survived) God announces that no beauty is\n                    complete
  without praise. By inference, therefore, the poet's sta- tus was holy and his function
  was to\n                    celebrate. But what Pindar was celebrating in his hymns
  of victory for\n                    athletes, and why the odes are apparently lacking
  in unity constitute an\n                    enigma. While there is no mys- tery
  as to to\n                    whom the\n                    ἐπινίκια\n                    were
  addressed, there is ambiguity as to the true subject of the poems.\n                        More-
  over the praises characteristically\n                    open brilliantly, as\n
  \                    all readers have remarked, but trail off and merely stop, a\n
  \                   criticism that may not be relevant to works meant to be orchestrated
  and\n                    choreographed. Nevertheless the structural peculiarities
  may point to\n                    another level of meaning if the poems are accepted
  as Pindar's records\n                    of theophanies that occurred at religious
  games, an institution that was\n                    more ancient than Homer and
  the Trojan War. Traditionally, the arena\n                    in which the contest
  took place was sacred ground, the athletic event an\n                        agon,
  and the victory a kairos that transformed the contestant into a hero, a term\n                    originally
  applied only to the dead, but progressively applied to the\n                    living.\n
  \               This cultural change created a third, ambiguous middle zone between
  the\n                    natural and supernatural worlds, in metaphysical terms
  a new ontological\n                        cate- gory to which the living aspired.\n
  \                   Through excellence which led to transcendence, the presence
  of the\n                    gods could be summoned to this juncture between two
  worlds. Victory\n                    conferred therefore a multivalent status upon
  the hero, the attainment of a\n                    more complete state of being
  poised between time and eternity. But the\n                    duration of this
  achievement was also ambiguous, since on the level of\n                    actuality
  the victory won by the indi- vidual\n                    could be lost at the next
  festival. It is likely, therefore, that the\n                    poet's solution
  to this cultural para- dox was\n                    the juxtaposition of his favorite
  images in the context of an amorphous\n                    structure: gold representing
  the permanence of the state of pure being;\n                    light repre- senting
  the incandescent\n                    moment of victory when the hero became a presence,
  its occurrence a\n                    metaphor for the process of heroization, and
  its visible behavior\n                    mysterious and of short duration. The
  waning structure of the Pindarics may\n                    allude therefore to metaphysical
  problems that had no solutions, problems\n                    that in a prelogical
  age could be expressed only in mythopoeic terms.\n                The traditional
  practice of classifying according to the place of the\n                    festival
  might have been consonant with Pindar's intention, for if the\n                    poems
  were records of theophanies, where they occurred was more impor- tant than other
  considerations. The Olympia I, in Richmond Lattimore's translation, begins:\n                        \n
  \                           Best of all things is water; but gold, like a gleaming
  fireby night, outshines all pride of wealth beside.But, my heart, would you chant
  the glory of games,look never beyond the sunby day for any star shining brighter
  through the deserted air,nor any contest than Olympia greater to sing.It is thence
  that the song winds strandsin the hearts of the skilled to celebratethe son of Kronos.
  They come their waysto the magnificent board of Hieron....\n                    \n
  \                   050\n                     A prose reading structured according
  to hierarchy might be as\n                    follows:\n                \n                    Water
  is the best of all things if usefulness is the criterion, but it\n                        is
  too humble and ordinary to attract attention. Gold, on the other\n                        hand,
  not only has the appearance of excellence but is in fact more\n                        valuable
  than other metals. But better than either of these is my ode\n                        composed
  at Olympia, sacred to Zeus, and occasioned by the victory of\n                        Syracusan
  Hieron....\n                \n                That this univocal lucidity was achieved
  by limiting meanings either by\n                    amplification or its opposites,
  com-\n                    pression or suppression, reveals something of the aims
  and\n                    techniques of Pindar. A multivalenced reading might superimpose
  upon the\n                    prose version the follow- ing:\n                \n
  \                   Water is the best of all things because it supports life which
  is the\n                        best of all things. But what is best in the world
  of nature is not best\n                        in the metaphysical realm, since
  the gold of pure being outshines the\n                        earthly fame that
  adheres to the possessors of great wealth. But I am a\n                        poet,
  and poetry is of this world. Therefore in the search for subjects\n                        I
  look no further than the visible world, but choose excellence.\n                        The
  sun has no rivals for brilliance by day, Olympia—sacred\n                        to
  the son of Kronos—none for antiquity and dignity....\n                \n                Pindar
  has contrived different levels of reality with different criteria of\n                    excellence
  through the use of gnomic opening, riddle, paradox, symbol,\n                    myth,
  and a multiplicity of meanings through overlapping cate- gories. Moreover, suppressed
  information\n                    that must be inferred is not only technique but
  meaning in poems that\n                    both celebrate and are theophanies. Olympia
  is compared to the sun that\n                    makes invisible lesser stars. That
  Pythia, Isthmia, and Nemea are not\n                    mentioned may be more than
  tact. Also, the term “Son of\n                    Kronos” is not only traditional
  formula, but a way of\n                    evoking both gods for the purpose of
  opposing Time with Permanence if\n                    the self-manifestation of
  Zeus is the true subject of the poem. Standing,\n                    as it were,
  historically between Mycenae and Athens, and artistically\n                    between
  temple and hippodrome, the Theban Pindar in life was awarded\n                    the
  right to an equal share of first-fruit offer-\n                        ings by the
  Pythian priestess of Delphi, and after death,\n                    heroization,
  his ghost being invited annually to dine with Apollo (Gilbert\n                    Norwood,
  Pindar [1945]). But religious games,\n                    Thebes, and Pindar were
  all anachro- nisms\n                    in the light of world history, for the political
  reality of the expansion\n                    of the Persian Empire and the need
  for a Greek response gave the leadership\n                    of that civilization
  to Athens.\n                The rapidity of change that accounts for the ultimate
  displacement of the\n                    arts in Athens also explains the ascendance
  of drama over lyric in the\n                    early stages of this process. For,
  according to John H. Finley, Jr.,\n                    Aeschylus was “the inventor
  of the idea of meaningful\n                     time” (Pindar and Aeschylus\n                    [1955]).
  But the optimistic view of history presented in Aeschylus' Oresteia gave way to
  the inconclusive debate in\n                    Sophocles' Antigone, and to the
  doubts raised as to\n                    the ambiguous benefits of language in Euripides'
  Hippolytus, for the cultural relativity introduced by the\n                    Sophists
  had challenged not only the traditional content of the arts, but\n                    the
  connection between words and things, as well. Thus on the one hand\n                    Aristophanes
  complained that “They have dethroned Zeus, and\n                    Vortex is King”
  (Georgio di Santillana, The\n                        Origins of Scientific Thought
  [1961]). On the other hand, the new\n                    status of language as reasoning
  instrument made words the domain of crea- tors of systems: the scientists,\n                    philosophers,
  and histo- rians in whom the\n                    tacit faith of the dramatists
  was continued. Their assertion of the\n                    inevitability of conse-
  quences from acts\n                    knowingly or unwittingly committed was abstracted
  as the uniformity of\n                    nature's laws which could be discovered
  by following the laws of logic.\n                    For the rationalists, therefore,
  ambiguity was neither thing nor\n                    principle, but a phase in the
  reasoning process between perception and\n                    knowledge. But the
  history of this movement was also one of degeneration,\n                    since
  “Men seemed to be capable of sacrificing the Law of\n                    Contradiction
  for the sake of comfort” (George Boas,Rationalism in Greek Philosophy [1961]).\n
  \               The history of rationalism parallels the story of introspection
  and the\n                    discovery of the self. The reduc- tion of the\n                    wealth
  of Homeric terms for what subse-\n                    quently were the simplified
  categories of “body”\n                    and “soul” reveals the metamorphosis of
  the\n                    conception of man from aggregate to unit, a change confirmed
  in art by\n                    the abandonment of the geometric style of the late
  archaic period (Bruno\n                    Snell, The Discovery of the Mind: The
  Greek Origins of\n                        European Thought [1953]). This unification
  through simplification\n                        pro- duced at the same time a common\n
  \                   denominator that could be projected either as causal nexus or
  as focus\n                    of interest for artistic purposes. The failure of
  Greek politics thus gave\n                    a new direction to the arts in the
  Greco-Roman period (Moses Hadas, Hellenistic Cul- ture: Fusion\n                        and
  Diffusion [1959]). The emergence of the spiritual landscape of\n                    the
  pastoral lyric asserted the validity of the private and subjective\n                    world;
  the improbable world of the romances proclaimed at the same\n                    time
  the unpredictability of Fortune and a faith in an incomprehensible but\n                    benign
  Providence; and the composition of spiritual biographies called\n                    aretologies
  that transformed moral teachers into cult\n                    figures—all point
  to the kind of consolation men sought.\n                Nevertheless, after Aristotle,
  literary works ad-\n                        dressed to the reason as well as to
  the sentiments were subject\n                    to more stringent standards of
  consistency, hence the criticism of Vergil's\n                        Aeneid that
  persists to this day. Apparently in\n                    the cultural climate of
  his time,051\n                     even the political success of Augustan Rome did
  not prevent the\n                    poet from longing for the other world, and
  this moral ambivalence produced\n                    an artistic duplicity in an
  epic that attempted to satisfy by simple juxta- position the rival claims of both\n
  \                   worlds. The two halves of the epic are thus disjunctive, the
  first modeled\n                    upon the horizontal plan of the Odyssey, the
  second\n                    upon the vertical transcendence of the Iliad, with\n
  \                   no attempt to relate them. At mid-point between the two halves
  Vergil\n                    placed the gates from the underworld (VI, 888-98; Loeb\n
  \                       Library, I, 571):\n                \n                    And
  when Anchises had led his son over every scene, and fired his soul\n                        with
  love of fame that was to be, he tells him then of the wars he must\n                        thereafter
  wage, and instructs him of the Laurentine peoples and the\n                        city
  of Latinus and how he is to flee or face each toil.\n                    Two gates
  of Sleep there are, whereof the one is said to be of horn, and\n                        thereby
  an easy outlet is given to true shades; the other gleaming with\n                        the
  sheen of polished ivory, but false are the dreams sent by the\n                        spirits
  to the world above. There then with these words Anchises\n                        attends
  both his son and the Sibyl, and dismisses them by the ivory\n                        gate.\n
  \               \n                Because this episode is pivotal, its interpretation
  will determine the\n                    meaning of the whole work. The easiest solution
  is to conjecture a mistake\n                    on the part of the author. The principle
  of durior\n                        lectio, on the other hand, requires a reading
  of the text as\n                    it stands. Clearly Aeneas and the Sibyl have
  made their exit from the\n                    wrong gate if the world of political
  Rome is not to be dismissed as a vain\n                    dream; alternatively
  if the reality of Rome is asserted, Aeneas himself is\n                    a false
  dream. Thus the Law of Contradiction is evoked, and as the two\n                    halves
  of the epic seem mutually exclusive, cen-\n                        turies of readers
  have in effect discarded the last six books.\n                    It is likely,
  however, that the poet was in fact asserting both worlds but\n                    could
  find no satisfactory solution to his problem. The characterization of\n                    his
  eponymous hero as “pious” was Vergil's way of\n                    making him both
  historical founder and presiding genius of city and\n                    empire.
  Whereas the fusion of two roles in one character succeeded, the\n                    work
  as a whole did not, and the poet's instruction in his will that the\n                    epic
  be de- stroyed may be interpreted as the\n                    recognition of his
  failure to reconcile the ideas of history and\n                    eternity, a conjecture
  made more probable by the fact that Vergil died\n                    in Greece while
  revising the Aeneid. The precise\n                    destination of Vergil's cultural
  pilgrimage is unknown, but it was at\n                    Alexandria, through Philo's
  multileveled but unified interpretation of\n                    sacred his- tory,
  that a solution was found.\n                    Philo's elaborate rami- fications
  of the\n                    allegorical method are, therefore, the first critical
  treatises on one,\n                    perhaps the most rational, type of ambiguity.\n
  \               Among the backgrounds to the solution of this two-\n                    fold
  problem was typology, a chronological projection\n                     of allegory
  that was one of the several innovations of the Old\n                    Testament
  Prophets. Responding to the imme-\n                    diate political needs of
  a threatened Judea, their messi- anic message fused policy with prophecy by\n                    historical
  analogy. The recurrent cycle of slavery and deliverance\n                    encouraged
  faith in a redeemer; therefore some of these leaders saw their\n                    lives
  as both fact and symbol: they were “types” of\n                    Moses and Messiah,
  intermediary fig- ures that\n                    recapitulated past events while
  prophetically living the future. And by\n                    generalizing and extending
  in both directions it was possible to join\n                    together the end
  of history with its beginning, erasing the\n                    distinction between
  prophecy and apocalypse; thus for Isaiah, the\n                    Messiah that
  he prophesied was to be another Adam in another Paradise:\n                \n                    \n
  \                       And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse....
  And\n                            righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins,
  and faithfulness\n                            the girdle of his reins. The wolf
  also shall dwell with the lamb,\n                            and the leopard shall
  lie down with the kid.... And the lion shall\n                            eat straw
  like the ox\n                    \n                    \n                        (Isaiah
  11:1, 5-7).\n                    \n                \n                Isaiah's inclusion
  of a genealogy was an expression of faith in the\n                    continuity
  of history, even as his projec-\n                    tion of a Messiah documented
  the need for a cult figure (as\n                    alternative to relapse into
  idolatry) to focus the aspirations of a people\n                    in troubled
  times. Centuries later the selection of Jesus as the announced\n                    Second
  Adam gave to his followers a fixed point for their\n                    interpretation
  of history, and Moses was then reduced to a\n                    “type” who prefigured
  the Christ in whom the Law and\n                    the Prophetic promises were
  fulfilled. Alle-\n                    gory became therefore an indispensable tool
  for this new religion\n                    with evangelical and universalist aims.\n
  \               The Prophetic interpretation of political events constituted in
  effect the\n                    invention of world history. And because history
  was the revealed will of\n                    God, approved records of the past
  were subsequently organized into a\n                    canon and elevated to the
  status of Scripture. The transcendence implied by\n                    this new
  category of writing produced therefore works in Greco-Roman times\n                    that
  took on the character of vulgate romances with apocry- phal additions. The linear
  projection of history\n                    was now abandoned in favor of a single
  character who anachronistically\n                    embodied the past and future
  experi- ence of\n                    the people. But world history could also be
  projected in this fashion, as\n                    in the case of the gigantic statue
  of Nebuchadnezzar's dream, the different\n                        mate- rials of
  which the figure was made\n                    representing the chronology of kingdoms,
  the last or fifth monarchy\n                    being the millenium. The author
  of the Book of Daniel (a figure unrecorded\n                    elsewhere before
  the second cen- tury) retold\n                    therefore the history of the Jews,
  compos- ing\n                    a “myth” of the Old Testament as nucleus to a story\n
  \                   intended to encourage the people persecuted052\n                     under
  the Seleucid King, Antiochus Epiphanes. Al- though he set his story in Babylonia
  and Persia, in\n                    the stratified characterization of Daniel the
  reader recog- nizes Joseph and Solomon, and in the apocryphal addi- tions the ritualistic
  bias of the Haggidic\n                    tradition. In short, the character of
  Daniel is an “historical\n                        ex- emplum,” and the technique\n
  \                   of deliberate anachronism allowed the author to shift from Hebrew
  to\n                    late Aramaic in mid-sentence, a fact that could not be passed\n
  \                   unobserved by his first readers. Seen in this light, the Book
  of Daniel\n                    served the same aretalogical pur- pose as the\n                    Gospels,
  the author's open-ended scheme consistent with a religion\n                    historically
  predicated on the metaphysical principle of becoming. But\n                    unlike
  the Gospels, Daniel records the Jewish retreat from uni- versalism, a fact that
  also explains\n                    their rejection of Philo as biblical exegete.
  Contrary to his\n                    intentions, therefore, Philo became the ancestor
  to the medieval\n                    Christian philosophers (Harry Austryn Wolfson,
  Philo, 2 vols. [1962]).\n                The allegorization that unified the Old
  and New Testaments for the\n                    Christians also transformed their
  Bible into a universal history; therefore\n                    the word alle- gory
  acquired a new meaning. For\n                    the Greek ration- alists, allegory
  referred\n                    merely to a figurative use of language—in short, a
  fiction. But\n                    for the Christians symbols were nothing less than
  visible signs of the\n                    Truth they were instructed to propagate
  universally. In the resulting\n                    conflicts the production of apologies
  in response to attacks progressively\n                    clarified doctrine and
  assumptions (Claude Tresmontant, La Métaphy- sique du\n                        christianisme
  et la naissance de la philosophie\n                    chrétienne [1961]) that later
  received systematic treat- ment (Étienne Gilson, La Philosophie au Moyen Age [1952]).\n
  \               But it was on the level of sentiment that the appeal of Christianity
  lay,\n                    since the pessimism inherent in the Greek cyclical notion
  of history, and\n                    its counterpart for the individual, endless
  reincarnation in an un- changing world governed by eternal\n                    laws—could
  not compete against a religion that recognized the\n                        individ-
  ual soul and offered a personal\n                    redeemer, a compas- sionate
  God, and a\n                    progressive, meaningful world his- tory. The\n                    conversion
  of Constantine that automatically made Christianity the official\n                    religion
  of the empire, and the expansion of the Church's boundaries as\n                    other
  forms of rule failed marked the extent and degree of this\n                    cultural
  revolution. According to Erwin Panofsky, (Gothic\n                        Architecture
  and Scholasticism [1951], pp. 3, 4):\n                \n                    To the
  Carolingian revival of the arts there corresponds, in philosophy,\n                        the
  phenomenon of John the Scot, equally magnificent, equally\n                        unexpected....
  About a hundred years of fermentation in both fields\n                        were
  followed, in art,\n                         by a variety and contrariety of Romanesque...
  and, in\n                        theology and philosophy, by a similar multiplicity
  of diver- gent currents, from uncompromising fideism and\n                        ruthless
  rationalism to the proto-humanism of... the school of\n                        Chartres.\n
  \               \n                The allegory, analogy, and symbolism that charac-\n
  \                       terized medieval thought was the very foundation of the
  Gothic\n                    church, beginning with the cruciform groundplan and
  the general orientation\n                    of the struc- ture. The common supposition\n
  \                   that everything visible was a symbol led William Durandus, the
  thirteenth- century Bishop of Mende, to\n                    compile and invent
  in his Rationale divinorum\n                        officiorum layer upon layer
  of meaning to every detail of\n                    church, ornaments, rites, and
  ceremonies. Thus the foundation of the\n                    church represented Faith;
  the roof Charity, because it covered a\n                    multitude of sins; the
  door, Obedience—“If thou wilt\n                    enter into life, keep the Commandments”
  (Matthew 19:17).\n                    Moreover, the sacristy symbolized the womb
  of the Virgin Mary where Christ\n                    put on his humanity, since
  that was where the priests, his\n                    representatives on earth, put
  on their robes.\n                Because the main entrance to the church, the west
  door, faced the material\n                    world from which the laity came to
  worship, church facades became visual\n                        syn- opses of theology,
  and in some\n                    instances the anonymous artists found ways to represent
  doctrinal\n                    ambiguities. Among the statues and the high relief
  carvings that make\n                    up the facade of the Cathedral of Notre
  Dame in Paris is a standing niche\n                    figure of the Virgin Mary,
  heavy with Child. What distinguishes this work\n                    from others
  that serve a similar architectural function (Adolf\n                    Katzenellenbogen,
  The Sculptural Programs of Chartres\n                        Cathedral: Christ-Mary-Ecclesia
  [1959]) is the series of choices\n                    the artist made. Like his
  contemporaries, in his wish to recall an event in\n                    Time and
  to evoke its Eternal meaning he engaged in deliberate\n                    anachronism,
  for his Virgin is not yet the Mother of Jesus; never- theless she is already crowned
  the\n                    Queen of Heaven. But beyond these conventional details
  is the more\n                    significant combination of the Virgin's enigmatic
  smile and the gesture of\n                    her hands, arrested in mid-motion.
  The viewer is uncertain whether she\n                        (Figlia del tuo Figlio)
  is blessing the\n                    Fruit of her Womb or whether she is praying
  to the Eternal God. The\n                    ambiguity in the intent of her gesture
  reflected that of her status,\n                    for on the one hand the doctrine
  of Christ's humanity allowed one to\n                    believe that a dutiful
  Son would be obedient to the wishes of his Mother.\n                    On the other,
  it was also held that the Incarnation was the greatest\n                    indignity
  suffered by God—in which case the status of the Virgin\n                    was
  merely that of the Chosen Vessel which gave her a place of honor but\n                    not
  necessarily any authority in heaven. Consequently both rank and053\n                     function
  of Queen of Heaven and Mediatrix of Grace, titles for\n                    which
  no authority existed, were doubtful.\n                On the practical level the
  wish of the Church on Earth to be in accord with\n                    the one in
  Heaven raised questions touching upon the validity of\n                    unauthorized
  modes of worship. It is probable that the influence of\n                    Saint
  Bernard of Clairvaux, the Marian Doctor, en-\n                        couraged the
  church's toleration of this form of idolatry as\n                    counter-measure
  against the growing popularity of the secular cult of the\n                    Lady,
  no longer obscurely deified in trobar\n                    clus, but openly in the
  vernacular romances (Maurice Valency, In Praise of Love [1958]). The ambiguities
  that\n                    surround the statue in question stem from the authoritative
  statement of\n                    doctrine, the Creed, which remains officially
  a Mystery even today.\n                    The implications of a triune God, his
  dual nature, and the manner of his\n                    birth challenged the artist
  to present a mind in tacit play with\n                    unanswerable questions
  of faith inherent in the figures, both depicted and\n                        con-
  cealed.\n                The economic recovery of Europe that permitted the building
  of cathedrals\n                    also formalized education institutionally (Charles
  Homer Haskins, The Renais- sance of the\n                        12th Century [1927])
  a fact that may explain the shift from\n                    positive to systematic
  theology. But the pedagogue's shift of focus from a\n                    theory
  of knowledge to a theory of learning led not only to a\n                    reclassification
  of things according to theoretical, practical, mechanical,\n                    and
  logical categories, but to empiricism, as well. Consequently in their\n                        theolog-
  ical-aesthetic\n                    didascalica they were natural theologians who\n
  \                   believed that the Creator could best be understood by his Creation,
  and\n                    thereby gave an impetus to the study of the world of things.\n
  \               They were also mystical theologians who thought in terms of a sequence
  of\n                    experience out of which knowledge was to be derived for
  the unification\n                    of man's mind with that of God. Hence the structural
  metaphor of the\n                    voyage for Saint Bonaventure's Itiner- arium,
  the nuptial metaphor in Hugh of Saint Victor'sDe arraha animae, and the figure of
  Jacob in theBenjamin Minor of the later Victorine, Richard. For\n                    Richard,
  man's ascent from earth to heaven by means of the mystical ladder\n                    was
  premiss and conclusion. What he analyzed was each episode of Jacob's\n                    life
  as aspects—ways of seeing and interpreting—of\n                    the ulti- mate
  unity of things that was implied\n                    by the one- ness of God. The
  two wives of Jacob\n                    served therefore two functions of as many
  views of the subject\n                    “Man” as the author cared to contemplate.
  The fer- tility of Leah and the sterility of Rachel,\n                    on one
  level, were interpreted as the appetites of the mind (Richard of Saint Victor, ed.
  and trans. Clare Kirch- berger [1957], p. 91):\n                \n                    \n
  \                    For as it is Leah's part to love since she is the affection
  of the\n                        soul, so it is Rachel's part to know, for she is
  reason. The former\n                        gives birth to ordered affection; the
  latter to the reason or the pure\n                        intelligence. Judah represents
  to us... love of the highest good. And\n                        when Judah is born...
  then Rachel begins to desire children\n                        passionately, for
  she wants to know. Where love is there is vision...\n                        and
  certainly he who can love invisible things will immediately\n                        desire
  to know them and to see them by the intelligence.\n                \n                The
  canon regulars of Saint Victor (in whose writings are preserved the\n                    earliest
  systematic treatment of the four-fold interpretation of Scripture:\n                    literal,
  allegorical, moral, and anagogical) were the ancestors of the\n                    author
  of the Epistle to Can Grande. But in adapting\n                    this type of
  multivalenced textual criticism to the Divine Com- edy the author of the\n                    letter
  (if it was Dante) stipulated only two, the literal and the\n                    unspecified
  symbolic, ambiguously stating that the work was\n                        “polysemos,
  hoc est plurium\n                    sensuum,” thus leaving open the question of
  how many\n                    levels of meaning apply.\n                From a structural
  point of view the Commedia might\n                    have included a fourth part,
  since the Christian heaven was located outside\n                    the closed Ptolemaic
  cosmos. But while staying within this universe, Dante\n                    chose
  to open up his world conditionally. Consequently the problem\n                    that
  confronts the reader at the end of Purgatorio\n                    is similar to
  the pivotal episode in the Aeneid. But\n                    unlike Vergil's disjunctive
  ambiguity, Dante's Garden of Eden is a\n                    conjunctive symbol,
  the most complex and open of nexuses in Western\n                    letters. In
  Eden the pilgrim Dante sees in a vision a giant temporalized\n                    emblem
  (more complex than Dürer's for the Emperor Maxi- milian I) that is a pageant of
  the\n                    Church. This allegory has been glossed alternatively as
  the Church\n                    Militant on earth or the Church Triumphant in Heaven,
  but the\n                    probability that Dante intended both is made more likely
  by the location of\n                    this episode in the work. For the purposes
  of his narrative, from Eden the\n                    pilgrim Dante continued his
  voyage to God in the Paradiso, but in terms of the meaning of the work, the\n                    untold
  story of the future of mankind also begins at this point. Thus,\n                    on
  earth, the closed world of moral categories is obliterated by the\n                    recovery
  of innocence, and even the memory of past history is washed away\n                    by
  the waters of Lethe or Divine forgiveness, since Scripture assures\n                    us
  that “When He forgives He forgets.” This\n                    uncanonical second
  baptism constitutes therefore a new opportunity for man\n                    under
  the new dispensation of Christian hedonism. Thus Vergil's valedictory\n                        bene-
  diction to Dante (Purgatorio, XXVII, 131, 142):... lo tuo piacere omai prendi per
  duce... per ch'io te sovra te\n                        corono e mitrio (“Now take
  pleasure as your\n                    guide... [because you are now master of yourself,
  body and soul,] I\n                    therefore crown and mitre you”).\n                054\n
  \               \n                The withdrawal of Vergil as Dante's guide was
  the poet's way of announcing\n                    the obsolescence of reason as
  governing principle for human action or\n                    principle of political
  organization, since the second baptism made\n                    instinctive man's
  knowledge of natural order, the poet's definition of\n                    Good.
  His projection of Evil in theInferno recalls therefore the statue in the Book of
  Daniel, a human anatomy analyzed both\n                    tropologically and chronologically
  but inverted, its posture repre- senting the stance of sin in relation\n                    to
  the natural order created by God. Conversely, the figure of\n                    redemption
  in the Purgatorio is represented upright,\n                    the attainment of
  the recta ratio by man\n                    paradoxically obliterating his need
  for it. Consequently the problem that\n                    is raised is the connection
  in Dante's mind between the ideas of the\n                    possible intellect
  and plenitude, and what these terms meant to him. In his\n                    political
  theory, stated in metaphysical terms, Dante was explicit on the\n                    first
  topic, but not the second (De\n                    Monarchia, trans. H. W. Schneider
  [1957], p. 6):\n                \n                    ... since this power can not
  be completely actualized in a single man or\n                        in any of the
  particular communi-\n                        ties... there must be a multitude in
  mankind through whom this\n                        whole power can be actualized;
  just as there must be a multitude of\n                        created beings to
  manifest ade- quately\n                        the whole power of prime matter....
  With this judgment Averroes agrees\n                        in his commentary on
  De anima.\n                \n                The cultural rebirth of man announced
  by Dante was projected two centuries\n                    later as a revolution
  in education by Rabelais, for whom the exploration of\n                        hu-
  man possibilities through actualization\n                    automatically meant
  the rejection of allegory and multiple levels of\n                    reality. He
  therefore blasted, in the Prologue to the First Book of Gargantua, the tradition
  that had ex- tended from Philo to his day (trans. J. M. Cohen,\n                    Penguin
  Classics [1955], p. 38):\n                \n                    But do you faithfully
  believe that Homer, in writing hisIliad and Odyssey, ever had in\n                        mind
  the allegories squeezed out of him by Plutarch, Heraclides\n                        Ponticus,
  Eustathius, and Phornutus, and which Politian afterwards\n                        stole
  from them in his turn? If you do, you are not within a\n                        hand's
  or a foot's length of my opinion. For I believe them to\n                        have
  been as little dreamed of by Homer as the Gospel mysteries\n                        were
  by Ovid in his Metamorphoses; a case which a\n                        certain Friar
  Lubin, a true bacon-picker, has actually tried to\n                        prove,
  in the hope that he may meet others as crazy as himself\n                        and—as
  the proverb says—a lid to fit his kettle.\n                \n                It
  was not, however, the force of Rabelais' language, but the Scientific\n                    Revolution
  that destroyed the alle- gorical\n                    method. According to Herbert
  Butterfield inThe Origins of Modern Science (1957), pp. 7, 8:\n                \n
  \                   ... it outshines everything since the rise of Christianity and
  reduces\n                        the Renaissance and Reformation to the rank\n                         of
  mere episodes, mere internal displacements, within the\n                        system
  of medieval Christendom.... it changed the character of men's\n                        habitual
  mental operations... [and] looms so large as the real origin\n                        both
  of the modern world and of the modern mentality that our customary\n                            periodisa-
  tion of European\n                        history has become an anachronism and
  an encumbrance.\n                \n                Accordingly, we will approach
  the centuries extending from the Florentine\n                    Renaissance to
  the First World War as a single epoch, tracing the principle\n                    of
  ambig- uity under three headings, all\n                    ultimately derived from
  geographical and cosmological exploration.\n                \n                        1.
  Accidentalism in Open Systems.\n                     The seeming haphazardness of
  horizontal and open-ended works in\n                    the Renaissance was implicitly
  a new projection of ambiguity, for the sole\n                    rule of the Abbey
  of Thélème—Fay ce que vouldras—when translated to\n                    aesthetic
  principle produced compositions as savory and varie- gated (but unpredictable) as
  the Adventures of Pan-\n                    tagruel. Adventures, which for other
  men had led to the\n                    accidental discovery of new continents while
  merely searching for new ways\n                    of traveling to places long known,
  thus unwittingly shifted the center of\n                    the world from the Mediterranean
  to the Atlantic, and added impetus to\n                    the nationalism that
  challenged with a rival theory of sovereignty the\n                    first modern
  state, the Church. Similarly the faith in the goodness of\n                    instinct
  that dignified the study of man's actual behavior led to the\n                    discovery
  of the ego. But because the ambiguities of accidentalism at this\n                    time
  had to be conceptualized by alternative characterizations of God as\n                    either
  the rational or the capricious Uncreated Being, the result for\n                    men
  was fideistic optimism or nescience. Thus Rabelais' optimism shaded\n                    into
  skepticism for Mon- taigne, since the\n                    purposeless exploration
  of the inner world of man raised more questions\n                    than he could
  answer, or that he answered with another question:“Que sçay-je?” This\n                    impatient
  shrug of Montaigne reflects the quickened time-sense of the age\n                    that
  now found essays and short novellas more congenial fare than long\n                    accretions.
  But it was in the developed drama with its possibilities for\n                    the
  simultaneous presentation of multiple relationships and causal\n                    connections
  that the eclecticism and the ambiguities of an open world\n                    were
  best expressed.\n                No treatment of ambiguity can avoid the problem
  of Hamlet, since for so many both character and play have become\n                    synonymous
  with the term. But some of the problems are the invention of\n                    modern
  critics, dat- ing no earlier than the\n                    advent of the proscenium
  stage which introduced not only a different\n                    theater but also
  a different technique of interpreting drama. The mul- tiple playing areas of the
  Elizabethan\n                    stage, simulta- neous action, multiple\n                    motives,
  and the several levels055\n                     of reality that are the bases of
  Shakespearean drama- turgy were flattened out by the\n                    box-stage,
  realistic decor, and notions of verisimilitude and linear progres- sion of action
  that characterize the\n                    novels of Zola. Therefore the delight
  of the critic in the\n                    multivalence of Hamlet's madness, or speculation
  on the motives for\n                    the delay in revenge are false problems;
  Hamlet is under palace arrest, and\n                    only by his assumed antic
  disposition (plan known to Horatio) does he have\n                        li- cense
  to prowl and to spy.\n                The genuine ambiguities have to do with the
  ideas explored by Shakespeare,\n                    and with the structure and scope
  of the play. First, revenge is throughout\n                        Shake- speare
  a negative term, at best\n                    what Francis Bacon calls “a kind of
  wild justice, which the more\n                    man's nature runs to, the more
  ought law to weed it out.”\n                    Whether Shakespeare meant to say
  that revenge is acceptable when purged of\n                    passion and executed
  more in sorrow than in anger, or whether revenge is\n                    all that
  remains of justice when the times are out of joint must\n                    remain
  a moot point. Secondly, two notions of kingship are present in the\n                    play:
  on the political level, Den- mark's\n                    kings are elected; on the
  theological level suc-\n                        cession of reigns and of dynasties
  are foreordained by God.\n                    Thus, upon his providential return
  to Denmark, after Hamlet has proof of\n                    Claudius' guilt and the
  assur- ance that he is\n                    God's chosen instrument, he announces
  his royal pretension with\n                    “I, Hamlet the Dane.” Later, in reviewing
  with\n                    Horatio the evidence against Claudius, he declares that
  “the\n                    interim is mine,” sug- gesting\n                    that
  the eldest crime has made invalid the present reign. Hamlet,\n                    therefore,
  is his father's succes- sor, the\n                    purpose of his uncrowned rule
  to bring to an end a dynasty and his own life\n                    which are parts
  of the general rottenness of Denmark. Hamlet thus is\n                    both scourge
  of God and victim whose double role in life requires\n                    premeditation
  of all action to prevent the tainting of his mind, that\n                    purity
  rewarded in death by an apotheosis hymned by flights of angels.\n                But
  death for the other characters is also a con-\n                        summation,
  the manner of their dying indicating, but not\n                    revealing entirely,
  the ambiguous connection be-\n                    tween the actualization of God's
  will that is provi- dence, and justice on earth. Among the problems\n                    that
  Hamlet ponders therefore are the purposes of knowl- edge, the limits of reason,
  and God's will. But ulti- mately all attempts at the capturing of\n                    God's
  mind are not only vain but blasphemous; therefore augury must be\n                    defied,
  and like the fallen sparrow man is God's captive, nescience\n                    reason's
  response to omniscience, and readiness the proper state of the\n                    will
  in relation to providence.\n                The historical setting and the scope
  of the play are impossible to\n                    determine, since on the one hand
  the\n                     ostensible reason for dispatching Hamlet to England is
  for the\n                    collection of the Danegeld (ca. ninth century); on
  the other hand, he is a\n                    student at Wittenberg which was founded
  in 1502, but which did not enjoy a\n                    foreign reputation until
  Shakespeare's day. Obviously anach- ronism is present, but the usual\n                    function
  of collapsing time does not seem to apply. In Hamlet the author's motive appears
  to be the opposite: the\n                    extension of Danish and English history
  centuries beyond the two\n                    months required by the action. Similarly,
  the dramatic structure,\n                    “all beginning,” becomes appropriate
  when it is\n                    perceived that Shakespeare was experimenting with
  the hero in posse, a risky artistic challenge that requires\n                    the
  identification of an adolescent protagonist with his potentialities\n                    rather
  than with his achieve- ments, with\n                        becoming rather than
  with being: “For he was likely, had he been put on, to have\n                    prov'd
  most royal.”\n                Technically, Shakespeare had to negotiate the con-\n
  \                       stant shift in focus from the drama on the stage to the
  drama\n                    within Hamlet's inexperienced but learning mind by regularly
  suspending the\n                    action with an ab- normal number of\n                    internalizing
  soliloquies. That Shakespeare thought he succeeded in his\n                    attempts
  may be seen in Fortinbras' epilogue, for when the poet feels\n                    secure
  in his accomplishment he characteristically vio- lates the illusion he has created
  in order to reveal\n                    his hand as creator. As for the meaning
  of so protean a play, the\n                    history of Hamlet criticism parodies
  Polonius'\n                    response to cloud formations, the various inter-
  pretations placed upon Hamlet's antic disposition\n                    by the other
  characters, and their various reactions to the play\n                    within
  the play—all these examples anticipating the Rorschach\n                    Test
  (1923) which is based upon the interpretation of an articulate but\n                    amorphous
  shape that elicits self-revealing commentary. The work is\n                    therefore
  informed with its own literary criticism, including the tacit\n                    assertion
  that works of art may be exercises in criticism as well as\n                    creation,
  endeavors always subject to the fashions of the day. The explicit- ness of this
  awareness Shakespeare\n                    reserved for his Cleopatra (Antony and
  Cleopatra, V,\n                    ii):\n                \n                    \n
  \                       The quick comediansExtemporally will stage us and presentOur

  Cleopatra boy my greatnessI'th' posture of a whore.\n                \n                But
  the poet's desire to free his work from himself and from Time is also\n                    present
  in Hamlet, for the play concludes with an\n                    infinite regress.
  Horatio offers to follow his prince in death, but his\n                    duties
  are not yet over. He is not only to report Hamlet's cause aright056\n                     to
  the unsatisfied, but also, in this harsh world, to draw his\n                    breath
  in pain “to tell my story.” Because Shake- speare's Hamlet is not the Hamlet of\n
  \                   saga, chronicle, romance, or other dramatic presentations, telling
  the\n                    story aright requires returning to the beginning, da\n
  \                       capo, and re-experiencing the play, a simple form of regress\n
  \                   that was a familiar device in music.\n                \n                        2.
  The Autonomy of Art and Self-Reference.\n                     The multivocality
  of Shakespearean drama that conceals the\n                    author's point of
  view finds its counterpart in painting with Leonardo's\n                    invention
  of sfumato. This shading and blurring of\n                    outline in combination
  with the disjunctive background explains the\n                    enigmatic quality
  of the Mona Lisa (E. H. Gombrich, The\n                        Story of Art, 9th
  ed. [1958]). A comparison of her smile with\n                    that of the Virgin
  of Notre Dame described above reveals the historic\n                    changes
  in artistic aims, since re- peated\n                    viewings of the medieval
  statue will add noth-\n                    ing to the doctrinal ambiguities once
  they are per- ceived, for the work, like the church's sacraments,\n                    was
  no more than a visible sign for a reality that existed elsewhere.\n                    But
  in the case of Leonardo it is precisely the repeated viewings that\n                    convince
  the beholder that her expressions change. Because the moods of\n                    the
  beholder that are read into the picture are ipso\n                        facto\n
  \                    valid, viewing the Mona Lisa becomes a continuous process of\n
  \                   collaborative recreation. Thus the roles of artist and audience
  are\n                    temporally reversed, and the question of who is who and
  what is what\n                    remains an open one. This problem was made the
  subject of a painting\n                    by Vermeer (Figure 1).\n                The
  original title of “An Artist in His Studio” was\n                    “The Painter's
  Art” (Lawrence Gowing, Vermeer [1952]) which tells us a great deal more about the\n
  \                   meaning of the work. Vermeer has depicted an artist painting
  from a human\n                    model costumed and furnished with the trumpet
  of fame, the book of history,\n                    and the crown of immortality.
  But a number of questions are raised in\n                    the viewer's mind.
  First, the imper-\n                    sonation of Immortality, whether it can be
  done, and what reality\n                    there is in the artist's portrait of
  her. It has therefore been conjectured\n                    that the artist was
  painting Hope although his model represented\n                    another figure.
  Secondly, the causal connection between fame and the\n                    artist's
  work have been reversed, for fame is a by-product of, not the\n                    subject
  of a painting.\n                But more importantly, who is the artist? The identity
  of the painter\n                    depicted by Vermeer is concealed from the viewer
  since he is seen only from\n                    the back. And when one steps outside
  the frame of the canvas, the same\n                    question is posed in a different
  context, for the beholder is standing\n                    where Vermeer must have
  stood as he painted the picture. While this last\n                    point may
  be made of all easel paintings, it has special relevance to\n                    this
  particular work because of the subject and its treatment. On the left\n                    side
  of the canvas is part of a tapestry painted to look as though it might\n                    have
  been hanging over the canvas itself. But an equally possible\n                    interpretation
  is that it hangs in the doorway that separates two rooms. In\n                    either
  case it is pulled back to reveal an artist in his\n                    studio—or,
  “An Artist in His Studio.”\n                    Whosesoever the hand that pulls
  back the tapestry to reveal the painter\n                    painting, the viewer
  is permitted an insight into the creative process\n                    itself, the
  most secret of mysteries. Yet at the same time it is also\n                    public
  and cosmic, for fame is the judgment of the world, but the\n                    governance
  of the world may be providential or entirely fortuitous, an\n                    historical
  accident.\n                What then is the “subject” of this painting whose\n                    surface
  lucidity, explicitness of detail, and quietness of statement\n                    conceal
  as many ambiguities as the beholder can think up? It is astonishing\n                    that
  something originat- ing in so small and\n                    contained an area as
  a narrow Dutch room can have such wide application.\n                    But to
  say that an event “originates” in a specific\n                    place is to make
  an arbitrary decision, for within the context of the\n                    assumptions
  implicit in the painting, this need not be the case. If no\n                    limits
  of inference are set and if the057\n                     categories of causal relations
  are placed in doubt, each detail\n                    in the painting may at the
  same time be both cause and effect. Moreover,\n                    the abstraction
  that is Fame and the anonymity of the artist depicted\n                    place
  them in the category of common, not proper nouns. Consequently\n                    it
  may be surmised that Vermeer was handling abstractions that touch upon\n                    communication
  and the human understanding, both within the self and\n                    the public
  at large; that Vermeer was analyzing the interpenetration of\n                    working,
  thinking, and creating, as well as the possibility of an almost\n                    infinite
  succession of appreciation. That Vermeer's legal executor was\n                    the
  pioneer microbiologist Leeuwenhoek, famous for his microscopes, is\n                    perhaps
  not without significance.\n                The self-reference in a painting about
  painting was an acknowledgment of the\n                    disappearance of traditional
  content from art. When secularization also\n                    came to music, it
  had certain natural advantages that perhaps explains\n                    its ascendancy
  in the eighteenth century. Divorced from reference to the\n                    outside
  world, it be- came not only the most\n                    abstract and formal of
  the arts, but also a language without a subject. Or,\n                    stated
  in another way, it became the subject of its own discourse.\n                    Thus
  when the composers turned their attention to the exploration of formal\n                    patterns
  their realization that reiteration was the only referential mode\n                    available
  to this kind of music prompted them to explore the ambi- guities intrinsic to any
  melody. The\n                    pleasure they derived in contriving these excursions
  is recorded by\n                    the number and extent of variations upon themes,
  whether their own or those\n                    of others, for such exercises could
  be cast as independent works, as are\n                    the Goldberg Variations
  of Bach, or as part of a\n                    larger work. Because the point about
  themes and variations can most conve- niently be made by the simplest of\n                    examples,
  we choose the second movement of Haydn's G Major Symphony No. 94, the\n                    “Surprise,”
  one of the twelve he composed for the\n                    London season of 1792.
  In it Haydn projected a series of physical postures,\n                    psychological
  states, and courtly ceremonies that concluded in the\n                    genial
  nescience of a quiddity: What is a tune? For the oddity of\n                    reiterative
  utterances is that through repetition the original statement is\n                    both
  strengthened and under- mined, and\n                    credence in its validity
  is progressively obliterated into nonexisten\n\ndynaXML Error: Servlet ErrorServlet

  cultural history ambiguity has been a pejorative term until the twentieth century.\n
  \                   This bias against the presence of two or more meanings in any\n
  \                   statement reflects the general bias of the civilization which
  traditionally\n                    from Classical Greek times has placed its faith
  in reason and an orderly\n                    universe—a civilization which, by
  extension, has operated on a\n                    tacit belief in the reliability
  of the reasoning process and its\n                    correspondence with external
  reality. Consequently men for centuries did\n                    not question the
  relationship between words and things, and were able to\n                    assume
  that no responsible statement could contradict anyNevertheless, in spite of this
  general prejudice against confusing or\n                    misleading statements,
  certain kinds of ambiguous utterances were\n                    acceptable to the
  ancient Greeks. The earliest examples of these ambig- uities are sub-literary and
  are cast in\n                    forms that still reflect the primitive faith in
  a world that contains\n                    precise answers to all questions. Oracular
  utterances emanating from holy\n                    places presupposed the accuracy
  of the priestess's veiled message, since it\n                    was the voice of
  God that spoke through her. Because the passive role\n                    of medium
  did not include comprehension, eluci-\n                        dation for the priestess
  as well as the petitioner came with the\n                    passage of time. With
  arcane formulae and recipes the speaker assumed an\n                    active role—curses,
  spells, charms, and ritual signs and dances\n                    being early examples
  of human attempts to control external events\n                    through empirical
  means. The body of knowledge behind these practical\n                    skills
  was invariably recorded in symbolic language, but the obscurity of\n                    this
  form of technical jargon could have been ambiguous only to the\n                    non-initiates
  of occult fraternities.Closer to art in our sense of the word are riddles which
  are\n                    self-annihilating word games, a form of social entertainment
  that also\n                    presupposes the existence of precise answers to questions,
  but which\n                    require the agency of interlocutor and respondee
  to complete the\n                    process: riddles cease to exist when the meaning
  is discovered. The\n                    contrivance of an endpoint of only one possible
  answer or meaning\n                    differentiates riddles from enigmas, myths,
  and genuine works of art for\n                    which there are no determinable
  endpoints of contemplation. Ambiguity\n                    as an aesthetic principle
  emerged therefore when artists deliberately\n                    contrived complex
  structures that generated a plurality of meanings.In Greek literature it was the
  mantic Pindar who modified the oracular\n                    tradition for artistic
  purposes. In the Hymn to Zeus\n                    (only fragments of which have
  survived) God announces that no beauty is\n                    complete without
  praise. By inference, therefore, the poet's sta- tus was holy and his function was
  to\n                    celebrate. But what Pindar was celebrating in his hymns
  of victory for\n                    athletes, and why the odes are apparently lacking
  in unity constitute an\n                    enigma. While there is no mys- tery
  as to to\n                    whom the\n                    ἐπινίκια\n                    were
  addressed, there is ambiguity as to the true subject of the poems.\n                        More-
  over the praises characteristically\n                    open brilliantly, as\n
  \                    all readers have remarked, but trail off and merely stop, a\n
  \                   criticism that may not be relevant to works meant to be orchestrated
  and\n                    choreographed. Nevertheless the structural peculiarities
  may point to\n                    another level of meaning if the poems are accepted
  as Pindar's records\n                    of theophanies that occurred at religious
  games, an institution that was\n                    more ancient than Homer and
  the Trojan War. Traditionally, the arena\n                    in which the contest
  took place was sacred ground, the athletic event an\n                        agon,
  and the victory a kairos that transformed the contestant into a hero, a term\n                    originally
  applied only to the dead, but progressively applied to the\n                    living.This
  cultural change created a third, ambiguous middle zone between the\n                    natural
  and supernatural worlds, in metaphysical terms a new ontological\n                        cate-
  gory to which the living aspired.\n                    Through excellence which
  led to transcendence, the presence of the\n                    gods could be summoned
  to this juncture between two worlds. Victory\n                    conferred therefore
  a multivalent status upon the hero, the attainment of a\n                    more
  complete state of being poised between time and eternity. But the\n                    duration
  of this achievement was also ambiguous, since on the level of\n                    actuality
  the victory won by the indi- vidual\n                    could be lost at the next
  festival. It is likely, therefore, that the\n                    poet's solution
  to this cultural para- dox was\n                    the juxtaposition of his favorite
  images in the context of an amorphous\n                    structure: gold representing
  the permanence of the state of pure being;\n                    light repre- senting
  the incandescent\n                    moment of victory when the hero became a presence,
  its occurrence a\n                    metaphor for the process of heroization, and
  its visible behavior\n                    mysterious and of short duration. The
  waning structure of the Pindarics may\n                    allude therefore to metaphysical
  problems that had no solutions, problems\n                    that in a prelogical
  age could be expressed only in mythopoeic terms.The traditional practice of classifying
  according to the place of the\n                    festival might have been consonant
  with Pindar's intention, for if the\n                    poems were records of theophanies,
  where they occurred was more impor- tant than other considerations. The Olympia
  I, in Richmond Lattimore's translation, begins:Water is the best of all things if
  usefulness is the criterion, but it\n                        is too humble and ordinary
  to attract attention. Gold, on the other\n                        hand, not only
  has the appearance of excellence but is in fact more\n                        valuable
  than other metals. But better than either of these is my ode\n                        composed
  at Olympia, sacred to Zeus, and occasioned by the victory of\n                        Syracusan
  Hieron....That this univocal lucidity was achieved by limiting meanings either by\n
  \                   amplification or its opposites, com-\n                    pression
  or suppression, reveals something of the aims and\n                    techniques
  of Pindar. A multivalenced reading might superimpose upon the\n                    prose
  version the follow- ing:Water is the best of all things because it supports life
  which is the\n                        best of all things. But what is best in the
  world of nature is not best\n                        in the metaphysical realm,
  since the gold of pure being outshines the\n                        earthly fame
  that adheres to the possessors of great wealth. But I am a\n                        poet,
  and poetry is of this world. Therefore in the search for subjects\n                        I
  look no further than the visible world, but choose excellence.\n                        The
  sun has no rivals for brilliance by day, Olympia—sacred\n                        to
  the son of Kronos—none for antiquity and dignity....Pindar has contrived different
  levels of reality with different criteria of\n                    excellence through
  the use of gnomic opening, riddle, paradox, symbol,\n                    myth, and
  a multiplicity of meanings through overlapping cate- gories. Moreover, suppressed
  information\n                    that must be inferred is not only technique but
  meaning in poems that\n                    both celebrate and are theophanies. Olympia
  is compared to the sun that\n                    makes invisible lesser stars. That
  Pythia, Isthmia, and Nemea are not\n                    mentioned may be more than
  tact. Also, the term “Son of\n                    Kronos” is not only traditional
  formula, but a way of\n                    evoking both gods for the purpose of
  opposing Time with Permanence if\n                    the self-manifestation of
  Zeus is the true subject of the poem. Standing,\n                    as it were,
  historically between Mycenae and Athens, and artistically\n                    between
  temple and hippodrome, the Theban Pindar in life was awarded\n                    the
  right to an equal share of first-fruit offer-\n                        ings by the
  Pythian priestess of Delphi, and after death,\n                    heroization,
  his ghost being invited annually to dine with Apollo (Gilbert\n                    Norwood,
  Pindar [1945]). But religious games,\n                    Thebes, and Pindar were
  all anachro- nisms\n                    in the light of world history, for the political
  reality of the expansion\n                    of the Persian Empire and the need
  for a Greek response gave the leadership\n                    of that civilization
  to Athens.The rapidity of change that accounts for the ultimate displacement of
  the\n                    arts in Athens also explains the ascendance of drama over
  lyric in the\n                    early stages of this process. For, according to
  John H. Finley, Jr.,\n                    Aeschylus was “the inventor of the idea
  of meaningful\n                     time” (Pindar and Aeschylus\n                    [1955]).
  But the optimistic view of history presented in Aeschylus' Oresteia gave way to
  the inconclusive debate in\n                    Sophocles' Antigone, and to the
  doubts raised as to\n                    the ambiguous benefits of language in Euripides'
  Hippolytus, for the cultural relativity introduced by the\n                    Sophists
  had challenged not only the traditional content of the arts, but\n                    the
  connection between words and things, as well. Thus on the one hand\n                    Aristophanes
  complained that “They have dethroned Zeus, and\n                    Vortex is King”
  (Georgio di Santillana, The\n                        Origins of Scientific Thought
  [1961]). On the other hand, the new\n                    status of language as reasoning
  instrument made words the domain of crea- tors of systems: the scientists,\n                    philosophers,
  and histo- rians in whom the\n                    tacit faith of the dramatists
  was continued. Their assertion of the\n                    inevitability of conse-
  quences from acts\n                    knowingly or unwittingly committed was abstracted
  as the uniformity of\n                    nature's laws which could be discovered
  by following the laws of logic.\n                    For the rationalists, therefore,
  ambiguity was neither thing nor\n                    principle, but a phase in the
  reasoning process between perception and\n                    knowledge. But the
  history of this movement was also one of degeneration,\n                    since
  “Men seemed to be capable of sacrificing the Law of\n                    Contradiction
  for the sake of comfort” (George Boas,Rationalism in Greek Philosophy [1961]).The
  history of rationalism parallels the story of introspection and the\n                    discovery
  of the self. The reduc- tion of the\n                    wealth of Homeric terms
  for what subse-\n                    quently were the simplified categories of “body”\n
  \                   and “soul” reveals the metamorphosis of the\n                    conception
  of man from aggregate to unit, a change confirmed in art by\n                    the
  abandonment of the geometric style of the late archaic period (Bruno\n                    Snell,
  The Discovery of the Mind: The Greek Origins of\n                        European
  Thought [1953]). This unification through simplification\n                        pro-
  duced at the same time a common\n                    denominator that could be projected
  either as causal nexus or as focus\n                    of interest for artistic
  purposes. The failure of Greek politics thus gave\n                    a new direction
  to the arts in the Greco-Roman period (Moses Hadas, Hellenistic Cul- ture: Fusion\n
  \                       and Diffusion [1959]). The emergence of the spiritual landscape
  of\n                    the pastoral lyric asserted the validity of the private
  and subjective\n                    world; the improbable world of the romances
  proclaimed at the same\n                    time the unpredictability of Fortune
  and a faith in an incomprehensible but\n                    benign Providence; and
  the composition of spiritual biographies called\n                    aretologies
  that transformed moral teachers into cult\n                    figures—all point
  to the kind of consolation men sought.Nevertheless, after Aristotle, literary works
  ad-\n                        dressed to the reason as well as to the sentiments
  were subject\n                    to more stringent standards of consistency, hence
  the criticism of Vergil's\n                        Aeneid that persists to this
  day. Apparently in\n                    the cultural climate of his time,And when
  Anchises had led his son over every scene, and fired his soul\n                        with
  love of fame that was to be, he tells him then of the wars he must\n                        thereafter
  wage, and instructs him of the Laurentine peoples and the\n                        city
  of Latinus and how he is to flee or face each toil.Two gates of Sleep there are,
  whereof the one is said to be of horn, and\n                        thereby an easy
  outlet is given to true shades; the other gleaming with\n                        the
  sheen of polished ivory, but false are the dreams sent by the\n                        spirits
  to the world above. There then with these words Anchises\n                        attends
  both his son and the Sibyl, and dismisses them by the ivory\n                        gate.Because
  this episode is pivotal, its interpretation will determine the\n                    meaning
  of the whole work. The easiest solution is to conjecture a mistake\n                    on
  the part of the author. The principle of durior\n                        lectio,
  on the other hand, requires a reading of the text as\n                    it stands.
  Clearly Aeneas and the Sibyl have made their exit from the\n                    wrong
  gate if the world of political Rome is not to be dismissed as a vain\n                    dream;
  alternatively if the reality of Rome is asserted, Aeneas himself is\n                    a
  false dream. Thus the Law of Contradiction is evoked, and as the two\n                    halves
  of the epic seem mutually exclusive, cen-\n                        turies of readers
  have in effect discarded the last six books.\n                    It is likely,
  however, that the poet was in fact asserting both worlds but\n                    could
  find no satisfactory solution to his problem. The characterization of\n                    his
  eponymous hero as “pious” was Vergil's way of\n                    making him both
  historical founder and presiding genius of city and\n                    empire.
  Whereas the fusion of two roles in one character succeeded, the\n                    work
  as a whole did not, and the poet's instruction in his will that the\n                    epic
  be de- stroyed may be interpreted as the\n                    recognition of his
  failure to reconcile the ideas of history and\n                    eternity, a conjecture
  made more probable by the fact that Vergil died\n                    in Greece while
  revising the Aeneid. The precise\n                    destination of Vergil's cultural
  pilgrimage is unknown, but it was at\n                    Alexandria, through Philo's
  multileveled but unified interpretation of\n                    sacred his- tory,
  that a solution was found.\n                    Philo's elaborate rami- fications
  of the\n                    allegorical method are, therefore, the first critical
  treatises on one,\n                    perhaps the most rational, type of ambiguity.Among
  the backgrounds to the solution of this two-\n                    fold problem was
  typology, a chronological projection\n                     of allegory that was
  one of the several innovations of the Old\n                    Testament Prophets.
  Responding to the imme-\n                    diate political needs of a threatened
  Judea, their messi- anic message fused policy with prophecy by\n                    historical
  analogy. The recurrent cycle of slavery and deliverance\n                    encouraged
  faith in a redeemer; therefore some of these leaders saw their\n                    lives
  as both fact and symbol: they were “types” of\n                    Moses and Messiah,
  intermediary fig- ures that\n                    recapitulated past events while
  prophetically living the future. And by\n                    generalizing and extending
  in both directions it was possible to join\n                    together the end
  of history with its beginning, erasing the\n                    distinction between
  prophecy and apocalypse; thus for Isaiah, the\n                    Messiah that
  he prophesied was to be another Adam in another Paradise:And there shall come forth
  a rod out of the stem of Jesse.... And\n                            righteousness
  shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness\n                            the
  girdle of his reins. The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb,\n                            and
  the leopard shall lie down with the kid.... And the lion shall\n                            eat
  straw like the ox\n                        (Isaiah 11:1, 5-7).\n                    Isaiah's
  inclusion of a genealogy was an expression of faith in the\n                    continuity
  of history, even as his projec-\n                    tion of a Messiah documented
  the need for a cult figure (as\n                    alternative to relapse into
  idolatry) to focus the aspirations of a people\n                    in troubled
  times. Centuries later the selection of Jesus as the announced\n                    Second
  Adam gave to his followers a fixed point for their\n                    interpretation
  of history, and Moses was then reduced to a\n                    “type” who prefigured
  the Christ in whom the Law and\n                    the Prophetic promises were
  fulfilled. Alle-\n                    gory became therefore an indispensable tool
  for this new religion\n                    with evangelical and universalist aims.The
  Prophetic interpretation of political events constituted in effect the\n                    invention
  of world history. And because history was the revealed will of\n                    God,
  approved records of the past were subsequently organized into a\n                    canon
  and elevated to the status of Scripture. The transcendence implied by\n                    this
  new category of writing produced therefore works in Greco-Roman times\n                    that
  took on the character of vulgate romances with apocry- phal additions. The linear
  projection of history\n                    was now abandoned in favor of a single
  character who anachronistically\n                    embodied the past and future
  experi- ence of\n                    the people. But world history could also be
  projected in this fashion, as\n                    in the case of the gigantic statue
  of Nebuchadnezzar's dream, the different\n                        mate- rials of
  which the figure was made\n                    representing the chronology of kingdoms,
  the last or fifth monarchy\n                    being the millenium. The author
  of the Book of Daniel (a figure unrecorded\n                    elsewhere before
  the second cen- tury) retold\n                    therefore the history of the Jews,
  compos- ing\n                    a “myth” of the Old Testament as nucleus to a story\n
  \                   intended to encourage the people persecutedThe allegorization
  that unified the Old and New Testaments for the\n                    Christians
  also transformed their Bible into a universal history; therefore\n                    the
  word alle- gory acquired a new meaning. For\n                    the Greek ration-
  alists, allegory referred\n                    merely to a figurative use of language—in
  short, a fiction. But\n                    for the Christians symbols were nothing
  less than visible signs of the\n                    Truth they were instructed to
  propagate universally. In the resulting\n                    conflicts the production
  of apologies in response to attacks progressively\n                    clarified
  doctrine and assumptions (Claude Tresmontant, La Métaphy- sique du\n                        christianisme
  et la naissance de la philosophie\n                    chrétienne [1961]) that later
  received systematic treat- ment (Étienne Gilson, La Philosophie au Moyen Age [1952]).But
  it was on the level of sentiment that the appeal of Christianity lay,\n                    since
  the pessimism inherent in the Greek cyclical notion of history, and\n                    its
  counterpart for the individual, endless reincarnation in an un- changing world governed
  by eternal\n                    laws—could not compete against a religion that recognized
  the\n                        individ- ual soul and offered a personal\n                    redeemer,
  a compas- sionate God, and a\n                    progressive, meaningful world
  his- tory. The\n                    conversion of Constantine that automatically
  made Christianity the official\n                    religion of the empire, and
  the expansion of the Church's boundaries as\n                    other forms of
  rule failed marked the extent and degree of this\n                    cultural revolution.
  According to Erwin Panofsky, (Gothic\n                        Architecture and Scholasticism
  [1951], pp. 3, 4):To the Carolingian revival of the arts there corresponds, in philosophy,\n
  \                       the phenomenon of John the Scot, equally magnificent, equally\n
  \                       unexpected.... About a hundred years of fermentation in
  both fields\n                        were followed, in art,\n                         by
  a variety and contrariety of Romanesque... and, in\n                        theology
  and philosophy, by a similar multiplicity of diver- gent currents, from uncompromising
  fideism and\n                        ruthless rationalism to the proto-humanism
  of... the school of\n                        Chartres.The allegory, analogy, and
  symbolism that charac-\n                        terized medieval thought was the
  very foundation of the Gothic\n                    church, beginning with the cruciform
  groundplan and the general orientation\n                    of the struc- ture.
  The common supposition\n                    that everything visible was a symbol
  led William Durandus, the thirteenth- century Bishop of Mende, to\n                    compile
  and invent in his Rationale divinorum\n                        officiorum layer
  upon layer of meaning to every detail of\n                    church, ornaments,
  rites, and ceremonies. Thus the foundation of the\n                    church represented
  Faith; the roof Charity, because it covered a\n                    multitude of
  sins; the door, Obedience—“If thou wilt\n                    enter into life, keep
  the Commandments” (Matthew 19:17).\n                    Moreover, the sacristy symbolized
  the womb of the Virgin Mary where Christ\n                    put on his humanity,
  since that was where the priests, his\n                    representatives on earth,
  put on their robes.Because the main entrance to the church, the west door, faced
  the material\n                    world from which the laity came to worship, church
  facades became visual\n                        syn- opses of theology, and in some\n
  \                   instances the anonymous artists found ways to represent doctrinal\n
  \                   ambiguities. Among the statues and the high relief carvings
  that make\n                    up the facade of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris
  is a standing niche\n                    figure of the Virgin Mary, heavy with Child.
  What distinguishes this work\n                    from others that serve a similar
  architectural function (Adolf\n                    Katzenellenbogen, The Sculptural
  Programs of Chartres\n                        Cathedral: Christ-Mary-Ecclesia [1959])
  is the series of choices\n                    the artist made. Like his contemporaries,
  in his wish to recall an event in\n                    Time and to evoke its Eternal
  meaning he engaged in deliberate\n                    anachronism, for his Virgin
  is not yet the Mother of Jesus; never- theless she is already crowned the\n                    Queen
  of Heaven. But beyond these conventional details is the more\n                    significant
  combination of the Virgin's enigmatic smile and the gesture of\n                    her
  hands, arrested in mid-motion. The viewer is uncertain whether she\n                        (Figlia
  del tuo Figlio) is blessing the\n                    Fruit of her Womb or whether
  she is praying to the Eternal God. The\n                    ambiguity in the intent
  of her gesture reflected that of her status,\n                    for on the one
  hand the doctrine of Christ's humanity allowed one to\n                    believe
  that a dutiful Son would be obedient to the wishes of his Mother.\n                    On
  the other, it was also held that the Incarnation was the greatest\n                    indignity
  suffered by God—in which case the status of the Virgin\n                    was
  merely that of the Chosen Vessel which gave her a place of honor but\n                    not
  necessarily any authority in heaven. Consequently both rank andOn the practical
  level the wish of the Church on Earth to be in accord with\n                    the
  one in Heaven raised questions touching upon the validity of\n                    unauthorized
  modes of worship. It is probable that the influence of\n                    Saint
  Bernard of Clairvaux, the Marian Doctor, en-\n                        couraged the
  church's toleration of this form of idolatry as\n                    counter-measure
  against the growing popularity of the secular cult of the\n                    Lady,
  no longer obscurely deified in trobar\n                    clus, but openly in the
  vernacular romances (Maurice Valency, In Praise of Love [1958]). The ambiguities
  that\n                    surround the statue in question stem from the authoritative
  statement of\n                    doctrine, the Creed, which remains officially
  a Mystery even today.\n                    The implications of a triune God, his
  dual nature, and the manner of his\n                    birth challenged the artist
  to present a mind in tacit play with\n                    unanswerable questions
  of faith inherent in the figures, both depicted and\n                        con-
  cealed.The economic recovery of Europe that permitted the building of cathedrals\n
  \                   also formalized education institutionally (Charles Homer Haskins,
  The Renais- sance of the\n                        12th Century [1927]) a fact that
  may explain the shift from\n                    positive to systematic theology.
  But the pedagogue's shift of focus from a\n                    theory of knowledge
  to a theory of learning led not only to a\n                    reclassification
  of things according to theoretical, practical, mechanical,\n                    and
  logical categories, but to empiricism, as well. Consequently in their\n                        theolog-
  ical-aesthetic\n                    didascalica they were natural theologians who\n
  \                   believed that the Creator could best be understood by his Creation,
  and\n                    thereby gave an impetus to the study of the world of things.They
  were also mystical theologians who thought in terms of a sequence of\n                    experience
  out of which knowledge was to be derived for the unification\n                    of
  man's mind with that of God. Hence the structural metaphor of the\n                    voyage
  for Saint Bonaventure's Itiner- arium, the nuptial metaphor in Hugh of Saint Victor'sDe
  arraha animae, and the figure of Jacob in theBenjamin Minor of the later Victorine,
  Richard. For\n                    Richard, man's ascent from earth to heaven by
  means of the mystical ladder\n                    was premiss and conclusion. What
  he analyzed was each episode of Jacob's\n                    life as aspects—ways
  of seeing and interpreting—of\n                    the ulti- mate unity of things
  that was implied\n                    by the one- ness of God. The two wives of
  Jacob\n                    served therefore two functions of as many views of the
  subject\n                    “Man” as the author cared to contemplate. The fer-
  tility of Leah and the sterility of Rachel,\n                    on one level, were
  interpreted as the appetites of the mind (Richard of Saint Victor, ed. and trans.
  Clare Kirch- berger [1957], p. 91): For as it is Leah's part to love since she is
  the affection of the\n                        soul, so it is Rachel's part to know,
  for she is reason. The former\n                        gives birth to ordered affection;
  the latter to the reason or the pure\n                        intelligence. Judah
  represents to us... love of the highest good. And\n                        when
  Judah is born... then Rachel begins to desire children\n                        passionately,
  for she wants to know. Where love is there is vision...\n                        and
  certainly he who can love invisible things will immediately\n                        desire
  to know them and to see them by the intelligence.The canon regulars of Saint Victor
  (in whose writings are preserved the\n                    earliest systematic treatment
  of the four-fold interpretation of Scripture:\n                    literal, allegorical,
  moral, and anagogical) were the ancestors of the\n                    author of
  the Epistle to Can Grande. But in adapting\n                    this type of multivalenced
  textual criticism to the Divine Com- edy the author of the\n                    letter
  (if it was Dante) stipulated only two, the literal and the\n                    unspecified
  symbolic, ambiguously stating that the work was\n                        “polysemos,
  hoc est plurium\n                    sensuum,” thus leaving open the question of
  how many\n                    levels of meaning apply.From a structural point of
  view the Commedia might\n                    have included a fourth part, since
  the Christian heaven was located outside\n                    the closed Ptolemaic
  cosmos. But while staying within this universe, Dante\n                    chose
  to open up his world conditionally. Consequently the problem\n                    that
  confronts the reader at the end of Purgatorio\n                    is similar to
  the pivotal episode in the Aeneid. But\n                    unlike Vergil's disjunctive
  ambiguity, Dante's Garden of Eden is a\n                    conjunctive symbol,
  the most complex and open of nexuses in Western\n                    letters. In
  Eden the pilgrim Dante sees in a vision a giant temporalized\n                    emblem
  (more complex than Dürer's for the Emperor Maxi- milian I) that is a pageant of
  the\n                    Church. This allegory has been glossed alternatively as
  the Church\n                    Militant on earth or the Church Triumphant in Heaven,
  but the\n                    probability that Dante intended both is made more likely
  by the location of\n                    this episode in the work. For the purposes
  of his narrative, from Eden the\n                    pilgrim Dante continued his
  voyage to God in the Paradiso, but in terms of the meaning of the work, the\n                    untold
  story of the future of mankind also begins at this point. Thus,\n                    on
  earth, the closed world of moral categories is obliterated by the\n                    recovery
  of innocence, and even the memory of past history is washed away\n                    by
  the waters of Lethe or Divine forgiveness, since Scripture assures\n                    us
  that “When He forgives He forgets.” This\n                    uncanonical second
  baptism constitutes therefore a new opportunity for man\n                    under
  the new dispensation of Christian hedonism. Thus Vergil's valedictory\n                        bene-
  diction to Dante (Purgatorio, XXVII, 131, 142):... lo tuo piacere omai prendi per
  duce... per ch'io te sovra te\n                        corono e mitrio (“Now take
  pleasure as your\n                    guide... [because you are now master of yourself,
  body and soul,] I\n                    therefore crown and mitre you”).The withdrawal
  of Vergil as Dante's guide was the poet's way of announcing\n                    the
  obsolescence of reason as governing principle for human action or\n                    principle
  of political organization, since the second baptism made\n                    instinctive
  man's knowledge of natural order, the poet's definition of\n                    Good.
  His projection of Evil in theInferno recalls therefore the statue in the Book of
  Daniel, a human anatomy analyzed both\n                    tropologically and chronologically
  but inverted, its posture repre- senting the stance of sin in relation\n                    to
  the natural order created by God. Conversely, the figure of\n                    redemption
  in the Purgatorio is represented upright,\n                    the attainment of
  the recta ratio by man\n                    paradoxically obliterating his need
  for it. Consequently the problem that\n                    is raised is the connection
  in Dante's mind between the ideas of the\n                    possible intellect
  and plenitude, and what these terms meant to him. In his\n                    political
  theory, stated in metaphysical terms, Dante was explicit on the\n                    first
  topic, but not the second (De\n                    Monarchia, trans. H. W. Schneider
  [1957], p. 6):... since this power can not be completely actualized in a single
  man or\n                        in any of the particular communi-\n                        ties...
  there must be a multitude in mankind through whom this\n                        whole
  power can be actualized; just as there must be a multitude of\n                        created
  beings to manifest ade- quately\n                        the whole power of prime
  matter.... With this judgment Averroes agrees\n                        in his commentary
  on De anima.The cultural rebirth of man announced by Dante was projected two centuries\n
  \                   later as a revolution in education by Rabelais, for whom the
  exploration of\n                        hu- man possibilities through actualization\n
  \                   automatically meant the rejection of allegory and multiple levels
  of\n                    reality. He therefore blasted, in the Prologue to the First
  Book of Gargantua, the tradition that had ex- tended from Philo to his day (trans.
  J. M. Cohen,\n                    Penguin Classics [1955], p. 38):But do you faithfully
  believe that Homer, in writing hisIliad and Odyssey, ever had in\n                        mind
  the allegories squeezed out of him by Plutarch, Heraclides\n                        Ponticus,
  Eustathius, and Phornutus, and which Politian afterwards\n                        stole
  from them in his turn? If you do, you are not within a\n                        hand's
  or a foot's length of my opinion. For I believe them to\n                        have
  been as little dreamed of by Homer as the Gospel mysteries\n                        were
  by Ovid in his Metamorphoses; a case which a\n                        certain Friar
  Lubin, a true bacon-picker, has actually tried to\n                        prove,
  in the hope that he may meet others as crazy as himself\n                        and—as
  the proverb says—a lid to fit his kettle.It was not, however, the force of Rabelais'
  language, but the Scientific\n                    Revolution that destroyed the
  alle- gorical\n                    method. According to Herbert Butterfield inThe
  Origins of Modern Science (1957), pp. 7, 8:... it outshines everything since the
  rise of Christianity and reduces\n                        the Renaissance and Reformation
  to the rank\n                         of mere episodes, mere internal displacements,
  within the\n                        system of medieval Christendom.... it changed
  the character of men's\n                        habitual mental operations... [and]
  looms so large as the real origin\n                        both of the modern world
  and of the modern mentality that our customary\n                            periodisa-
  tion of European\n                        history has become an anachronism and
  an encumbrance.Accordingly, we will approach the centuries extending from the Florentine\n
  \                   Renaissance to the First World War as a single epoch, tracing
  the principle\n                    of ambig- uity under three headings, all\n                    ultimately
  derived from geographical and cosmological exploration.\n                        1.
  Accidentalism in Open Systems.\n                     The seeming haphazardness of
  horizontal and open-ended works in\n                    the Renaissance was implicitly
  a new projection of ambiguity, for the sole\n                    rule of the Abbey
  of Thélème—Fay ce que vouldras—when translated to\n                    aesthetic
  principle produced compositions as savory and varie- gated (but unpredictable) as
  the Adventures of Pan-\n                    tagruel. Adventures, which for other
  men had led to the\n                    accidental discovery of new continents while
  merely searching for new ways\n                    of traveling to places long known,
  thus unwittingly shifted the center of\n                    the world from the Mediterranean
  to the Atlantic, and added impetus to\n                    the nationalism that
  challenged with a rival theory of sovereignty the\n                    first modern
  state, the Church. Similarly the faith in the goodness of\n                    instinct
  that dignified the study of man's actual behavior led to the\n                    discovery
  of the ego. But because the ambiguities of accidentalism at this\n                    time
  had to be conceptualized by alternative characterizations of God as\n                    either
  the rational or the capricious Uncreated Being, the result for\n                    men
  was fideistic optimism or nescience. Thus Rabelais' optimism shaded\n                    into
  skepticism for Mon- taigne, since the\n                    purposeless exploration
  of the inner world of man raised more questions\n                    than he could
  answer, or that he answered with another question:“Que sçay-je?” This\n                    impatient
  shrug of Montaigne reflects the quickened time-sense of the age\n                    that
  now found essays and short novellas more congenial fare than long\n                    accretions.
  But it was in the developed drama with its possibilities for\n                    the
  simultaneous presentation of multiple relationships and causal\n                    connections
  that the eclecticism and the ambiguities of an open world\n                    were
  best expressed.No treatment of ambiguity can avoid the problem of Hamlet, since
  for so many both character and play have become\n                    synonymous
  with the term. But some of the problems are the invention of\n                    modern
  critics, dat- ing no earlier than the\n                    advent of the proscenium
  stage which introduced not only a different\n                    theater but also
  a different technique of interpreting drama. The mul- tiple playing areas of the
  Elizabethan\n                    stage, simulta- neous action, multiple\n                    motives,
  and the several levelsThe genuine ambiguities have to do with the ideas explored
  by Shakespeare,\n                    and with the structure and scope of the play.
  First, revenge is throughout\n                        Shake- speare a negative term,
  at best\n                    what Francis Bacon calls “a kind of wild justice, which
  the more\n                    man's nature runs to, the more ought law to weed it
  out.”\n                    Whether Shakespeare meant to say that revenge is acceptable
  when purged of\n                    passion and executed more in sorrow than in
  anger, or whether revenge is\n                    all that remains of justice when
  the times are out of joint must\n                    remain a moot point. Secondly,
  two notions of kingship are present in the\n                    play: on the political
  level, Den- mark's\n                    kings are elected; on the theological level
  suc-\n                        cession of reigns and of dynasties are foreordained
  by God.\n                    Thus, upon his providential return to Denmark, after
  Hamlet has proof of\n                    Claudius' guilt and the assur- ance that
  he is\n                    God's chosen instrument, he announces his royal pretension
  with\n                    “I, Hamlet the Dane.” Later, in reviewing with\n                    Horatio
  the evidence against Claudius, he declares that “the\n                    interim
  is mine,” sug- gesting\n                    that the eldest crime has made invalid
  the present reign. Hamlet,\n                    therefore, is his father's succes-
  sor, the\n                    purpose of his uncrowned rule to bring to an end a
  dynasty and his own life\n                    which are parts of the general rottenness
  of Denmark. Hamlet thus is\n                    both scourge of God and victim whose
  double role in life requires\n                    premeditation of all action to
  prevent the tainting of his mind, that\n                    purity rewarded in death
  by an apotheosis hymned by flights of angels.But death for the other characters
  is also a con-\n                        summation, the manner of their dying indicating,
  but not\n                    revealing entirely, the ambiguous connection be-\n
  \                   tween the actualization of God's will that is provi- dence,
  and justice on earth. Among the problems\n                    that Hamlet ponders
  therefore are the purposes of knowl- edge, the limits of reason, and God's will.
  But ulti- mately all attempts at the capturing of\n                    God's mind
  are not only vain but blasphemous; therefore augury must be\n                    defied,
  and like the fallen sparrow man is God's captive, nescience\n                    reason's
  response to omniscience, and readiness the proper state of the\n                    will
  in relation to providence.The historical setting and the scope of the play are impossible
  to\n                    determine, since on the one hand the\n                     ostensible
  reason for dispatching Hamlet to England is for the\n                    collection
  of the Danegeld (ca. ninth century); on the other hand, he is a\n                    student
  at Wittenberg which was founded in 1502, but which did not enjoy a\n                    foreign
  reputation until Shakespeare's day. Obviously anach- ronism is present, but the
  usual\n                    function of collapsing time does not seem to apply. In
  Hamlet the author's motive appears to be the opposite: the\n                    extension
  of Danish and English history centuries beyond the two\n                    months
  required by the action. Similarly, the dramatic structure,\n                    “all
  beginning,” becomes appropriate when it is\n                    perceived that Shakespeare
  was experimenting with the hero in posse, a risky artistic challenge that requires\n
  \                   the identification of an adolescent protagonist with his potentialities\n
  \                   rather than with his achieve- ments, with\n                        becoming
  rather than with being: “For he was likely, had he been put on, to have\n                    prov'd
  most royal.”Technically, Shakespeare had to negotiate the con-\n                        stant
  shift in focus from the drama on the stage to the drama\n                    within
  Hamlet's inexperienced but learning mind by regularly suspending the\n                    action
  with an ab- normal number of\n                    internalizing soliloquies. That
  Shakespeare thought he succeeded in his\n                    attempts may be seen
  in Fortinbras' epilogue, for when the poet feels\n                    secure in
  his accomplishment he characteristically vio- lates the illusion he has created
  in order to reveal\n                    his hand as creator. As for the meaning
  of so protean a play, the\n                    history of Hamlet criticism parodies
  Polonius'\n                    response to cloud formations, the various inter-
  pretations placed upon Hamlet's antic disposition\n                    by the other
  characters, and their various reactions to the play\n                    within
  the play—all these examples anticipating the Rorschach\n                    Test
  (1923) which is based upon the interpretation of an articulate but\n                    amorphous
  shape that elicits self-revealing commentary. The work is\n                    therefore
  informed with its own literary criticism, including the tacit\n                    assertion
  that works of art may be exercises in criticism as well as\n                    creation,
  endeavors always subject to the fashions of the day. The explicit- ness of this
  awareness Shakespeare\n                    reserved for his Cleopatra (Antony and
  Cleopatra, V,\n                    ii):But the poet's desire to free his work from
  himself and from Time is also\n                    present in Hamlet, for the play
  concludes with an\n                    infinite regress. Horatio offers to follow
  his prince in death, but his\n                    duties are not yet over. He is
  not only to report Hamlet's cause aright\n                        2. The Autonomy
  of Art and Self-Reference.\n                     The multivocality of Shakespearean
  drama that conceals the\n                    author's point of view finds its counterpart
  in painting with Leonardo's\n                    invention of sfumato. This shading
  and blurring of\n                    outline in combination with the disjunctive
  background explains the\n                    enigmatic quality of the Mona Lisa
  (E. H. Gombrich, The\n                        Story of Art, 9th ed. [1958]). A comparison
  of her smile with\n                    that of the Virgin of Notre Dame described
  above reveals the historic\n                    changes in artistic aims, since
  re- peated\n                    viewings of the medieval statue will add noth-\n
  \                   ing to the doctrinal ambiguities once they are per- ceived,
  for the work, like the church's sacraments,\n                    was no more than
  a visible sign for a reality that existed elsewhere.\n                    But in
  the case of Leonardo it is precisely the repeated viewings that\n                    convince
  the beholder that her expressions change. Because the moods of\n                    the
  beholder that are read into the picture are ipso\n                        facto\n
  \                    valid, viewing the Mona Lisa becomes a continuous process of\n
  \                   collaborative recreation. Thus the roles of artist and audience
  are\n                    temporally reversed, and the question of who is who and
  what is what\n                    remains an open one. This problem was made the
  subject of a painting\n                    by Vermeer (Figure 1).The original title
  of “An Artist in His Studio” was\n                    “The Painter's Art” (Lawrence
  Gowing, Vermeer [1952]) which tells us a great deal more about the\n                    meaning
  of the work. Vermeer has depicted an artist painting from a human\n                    model
  costumed and furnished with the trumpet of fame, the book of history,\n                    and
  the crown of immortality. But a number of questions are raised in\n                    the
  viewer's mind. First, the imper-\n                    sonation of Immortality, whether
  it can be done, and what reality\n                    there is in the artist's portrait
  of her. It has therefore been conjectured\n                    that the artist was
  painting Hope although his model represented\n                    another figure.
  Secondly, the causal connection between fame and the\n                    artist's
  work have been reversed, for fame is a by-product of, not the\n                    subject
  of a painting.But more importantly, who is the artist? The identity of the painter\n
  \                   depicted by Vermeer is concealed from the viewer since he is
  seen only from\n                    the back. And when one steps outside the frame
  of the canvas, the same\n                    question is posed in a different context,
  for the beholder is standing\n                    where Vermeer must have stood
  as he painted the picture. While this last\n                    point may be made
  of all easel paintings, it has special relevance to\n                    this particular
  work because of the subject and its treatment. On the left\n                    side
  of the canvas is part of a tapestry painted to look as though it might\n                    have
  been hanging over the canvas itself. But an equally possible\n                    interpretation
  is that it hangs in the doorway that separates two rooms. In\n                    either
  case it is pulled back to reveal an artist in his\n                    studio—or,
  “An Artist in His Studio.”\n                    Whosesoever the hand that pulls
  back the tapestry to reveal the painter\n                    painting, the viewer
  is permitted an insight into the creative process\n                    itself, the
  most secret of mysteries. Yet at the same time it is also\n                    public
  and cosmic, for fame is the judgment of the world, but the\n                    governance
  of the world may be providential or entirely fortuitous, an\n                    historical
  accident.What then is the “subject” of this painting whose\n                    surface
  lucidity, explicitness of detail, and quietness of statement\n                    conceal
  as many ambiguities as the beholder can think up? It is astonishing\n                    that
  something originat- ing in so small and\n                    contained an area as
  a narrow Dutch room can have such wide application.\n                    But to
  say that an event “originates” in a specific\n                    place is to make
  an arbitrary decision, for within the context of the\n                    assumptions
  implicit in the painting, this need not be the case. If no\n                    limits
  of inference are set and if theThe self-reference in a painting about painting was
  an acknowledgment of the\n                    disappearance of traditional content
  from art. When secularization also\n                    came to music, it had certain
  natural advantages that perhaps explains\n                    its ascendancy in
  the eighteenth century. Divorced from reference to the\n                    outside
  world, it be- came not only the most\n                    abstract and formal of
  the arts, but also a language without a subject. Or,\n                    stated
  in another way, it became the subject of its own discourse.\n                    Thus
  when the composers turned their attention to the exploration of formal\n                    patterns
  their realization that reiteration was the only referential mode\n                    available
  to this kind of music prompted them to explore the ambi- guities intrinsic to any
  melody. The\n                    pleasure they derived in contriving these excursions
  is recorded by\n                    the number and extent of variations upon themes,
  whether their own or those\n                    of others, for such exercises could
  be cast as independent works, as are\n                    the Goldberg Variations
  of Bach, or as part of a\n                    larger work. Because the point about
  themes and variations can most conve- niently be made by the simplest of\n                    examples,
  we choose the second movement of Haydn's G Major Symphony No. 94, the\n                    “Surprise,”
  one of the twelve he composed for the\n                    London season of 1792.
  In it Haydn projected a series of physical postures,\n                    psychological
  states, and courtly ceremonies that concluded in the\n                    genial
  nescience of a quiddity: What is a tune? For the oddity of\n                    reiterative
  utterances is that through repetition the original statement is\n                    both
  strengthened and under- mined, and\n                    credence in its validity
  is progressively obliterated into nonexisten\n\nMessage:A sequence of more than
