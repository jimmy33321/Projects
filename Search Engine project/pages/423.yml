  the case when it\r\n"
- "comes to investments. A growing body of evidence shows that funds with higher expenses\r\n"
- "do not, on average, perform better than lower-expense funds. In fact, research

  large bite out of your total portfolio assets.How to keep advisor fees low: If you’re not a DIY’er, and heck, most of us are not - especially when it comes to investing, consider using a digital investment advisor (sometimes referred to as a Robo-Advisor). The advisor fee is often half the cost of a traditional advisor with no downside. Some, like FutureAdvisor, even give you access to a licensed financial advisor on staff if you need hand-holding, or have complex questions. When shopping for a roboadvisor, don’t necessarily go with the cheapest option, after all, this is your nest egg! Be sure you understand what services are being offered and what access to a licensed advisor the company offers. Think about it like this, you wouldn’t go with the cheapest tattoo artist, or heart surgeon, for that matter. Protect your future generations’ wealth with quality advice.
- "\t\t\t\t\t\tHere's the takeaway:  Always pay attention to how much your investments
  are costing you - after all, your goal in investing\r\n"

  pocket today\r\n"
- "is money that isn’t available to grow in the future. Compounded over time, fees

  -- what fund fees are you currently paying for the money you have in a 401(k)? How
  about the admin fees? And how many investment choices are available to you? If you’re
  not sure of the answers, you’re not alone. Given that the average American now changes
  jobs every 4.6 years, it’s easy to lose track of old 401(k)s when you begin a new
  job -- it can feel like the last thing on your mind as you adjust to a new role
  and haggle over a new salary. However, slowly but surely losing your hard-saved
  money to compounding fees over time can make a huge impact on your future account
  balances. So, don’t be thinking just about your new compensation package when you
  switch jobs -- take advantage of the opportunity to consider rolling over your old
  401(k) to a Rollover IRA account so you can minimize a whole wealth of fees: trading,
  commissions, management, and so on. And don’t forget that you’ll almost certainly
  gain access to a wider set of funds than was available within the confines of your
  401(k).\n"

  you’re overpaying, and you have fewer investing\r\n"

  approach to investing,\r\n"
- "based on Nobel prize winning research, and is used by many portfolio managers.
  It works on two\r\n"
- "levels: 1. Asset Class Different asset classes do well in different situations
  and they each play a specific role in a portfolio.\r\n"
- "The main asset classes in which we invest at FutureAdvisor are stocks, bonds, real

  it’s important: \r\n"

- "comes to investments. A growing body of evidence shows that funds with higher expenses\r\n"
- "do not, on average, perform better than lower-expense funds. In fact, research
  indicates the\r\n"
- "average actively-managed fund performs worse than a low-cost index fund.Investment
  fees come in 3 main flavors:1. Trading Fees. These are the fees investors are charged
  when they buy or sell a stock, fund, or other asset.\r\n"
- "The actual cost can vary greatly, depending on the broker the investor is using,
  and these\r\n"
- "fees can add up if an investor is actively trading. Commissions are a large part
  of trading\r\n"

  costs (what\r\n"

- "investment, ETFs don’t have these load fees. How to keep fund fees low: Invest
  using low fee ETFs, instead of higher fee mutual funds.\r\n"
- "Because ETFs often require significantly less management and sales support, they
  are less\r\n"
- "expensive to operate, and that savings is passed on to you.3. Advisor FeesThese
  are the fees a financial professional will charge you for providing financial guidance\r\n"
- "and making trades on your behalf. Most advisors charge their clients based on the
  amount\r\n"
- "of assets they are managing for the client. These fees are often 1% or more, and
  can take a\r\n"
- "large bite out of your total portfolio assets.How to keep advisor fees low: If
  you’re not a DIY’er, and heck, most of us are not - especially when it comes to
  investing, consider using a digital investment advisor (sometimes referred to as
  a Robo-Advisor). The advisor fee is often half the cost of a traditional advisor
  with no downside. Some, like FutureAdvisor, even give you access to a licensed financial
  advisor on staff if you need hand-holding, or have complex questions. When shopping
  for a roboadvisor, don’t necessarily go with the cheapest option, after all, this
  is your nest egg! Be sure you understand what services are being offered and what
  access to a licensed advisor the company offers. Think about it like this, you wouldn’t
  go with the cheapest tattoo artist, or heart surgeon, for that matter. Protect your
  future generations’ wealth with quality advice.Here's the takeaway:  Always pay
  attention to how much your investments are costing you - after all, your goal in
  investing\r\n"
- "is to grow your pool of funds as much as you can. Anything that comes out of your
  pocket today\r\n"
- "is money that isn’t available to grow in the future. Compounded over time, fees
  can make a huge\r\n"
- "difference in what you have available when it comes time for retirement.Why It's
  Important: Investing on your own can feel overwhelming. When you’re not sure of
  the best path\r\n"
- "forward, it may feel like the safest thing to do with your cash is simply nothing,
  at least until\r\n"
- "you come across something you feel confident about investing in. Or you may not
  feel that\r\n"
- "it’s the right time to enter the market, thinking it’s better to wait for a dip
  so you can “buy\r\n"
- "low.” However, the data shows that trying to time the market doesn’t work much
  better\r\n"
- "than flipping a coin. If you factor in inflation, it turns out that the S&P 500
  has been within\r\n"
- "10% of it’s “highest point ever” for over 60% of the time since 1980!Unfortunately,
  as you’ll remember from earlier, research has shown that trying to time the market
  doesn’t work. Instead, make regular contributions to your investment accounts, over
  time, and as you have excess cash to put to work for you. While it’s impossible
  to predict the market, at least you’ll avoid the certainty of losing to inflation
  that comes with keeping money in cash. And since the market generally rises over
  time, why bet on paying higher prices in the future?Here's the takeaway: Make sure
  you set aside enough cash for emergency needs, and invest the rest. Don’t try to
  time the\r\n"
- "market.Why it’s important:  Quick -- what fund fees are you currently paying for
  the money you have in a 401(k)? How about the admin fees? And how many investment
  choices are available to you? If you’re not sure of the answers, you’re not alone.
  Given that the average American now changes jobs every 4.6 years, it’s easy to lose
  track of old 401(k)s when you begin a new job -- it can feel like the last thing
  on your mind as you adjust to a new role and haggle over a new salary. However,
  slowly but surely losing your hard-saved money to compounding fees over time can
  make a huge impact on your future account balances. So, don’t be thinking just about
  your new compensation package when you switch jobs -- take advantage of the opportunity
  to consider rolling over your old 401(k) to a Rollover IRA account so you can minimize
  a whole wealth of fees: trading, commissions, management, and so on. And don’t forget
  that you’ll almost certainly gain access to a wider set of funds than was available
  within the confines of your 401(k).Here's the takeaway:  If you have an old 401(k),
  there’s a decent chance you’re overpaying, and you have fewer investing\r\n"
- "options. Don’t delay, consider rolling it over into an IRA today.Why it’s important:
  We now all know that holding a diversified portfolio is smart, but, did you know
  that it matters\r\n"
- "where you hold those assets? Both taxable (e.g. a brokerage account) and tax-advantaged\r\n"
- "(e.g. 401(k), Roth IRA) accounts are key components of an ideal retirement strategy.\r\n"
- "However, some types of investments are better suited to one type of account over
  others.\r\n"
- "For instance, investments that pay dividends are best kept in tax-advantaged accounts,
  so\r\n"
- "that dividends aren’t taxed before they’re reinvested. Here's the takeaway: A well-diversified
  portfolio includes multiple types of assets, which ideally should be strategically\r\n"
- "allocated across both taxable and non-taxable accounts in order to minimize taxes
  overall. Consider\r\n"

  types into consideration when deciding how to allocate 12 asset classes across your portfolio.

  value, but that comes with the territory\r\n"
- "of investing -- over the short term, it’s going to happen. However, there’s a silver
  lining to\r\n"
- "these often temporary drops -- it’s possible to take advantage of dips in the market
  through\r\n"
- "a tactic called Tax-Loss Harvesting (TLH). TLH allows you to sell a losing investment,
  capture the losses on paper, and purchase a similar\r\n"
- "investment so your portfolio remains well-diversified. The losses that you capture
  via TLH can be used\r\n"
- "to offset capital gains elsewhere in your portfolio, or offset your income if you
  have no gains that year.To Tax-Loss Harvest effectively, it’s best to watch the
  market frequently -- even daily -- to identify\r\n"
- "opportunities where your positions have dropped in value and can be sold. This
  can be a cumbersome\r\n"
- "process to undertake on your own, and potentially tax-harmful, if not done correctly.
  But this is\r\n"
- "something that can easily be done by a computer. You can read a lot more about
  TLH here.Here's the takeaway:  Take advantage of TLH, but do it with care. It may
  be best to work with an automated advisor, like\r\n"
- "FutureAdvisor, who can track your investments in real time to take advantage of
  TLH opportunities,\r\n"
- "and ensure it’s done in a tax-optimal way. The average FutureAdvisor client sees
  a 0.50%*\r\n"
- "improvement in annual returns due to TLH. Why it's important:  How much is the
  right amount to save for retirement? The answer depends somewhat based\r\n"
- "on factors like your income, household finances, time to retirement, and current
  assets.\r\n"
- "However, broadly speaking, saving more today is doubly beneficial as it reduces
  the level of\r\n"
- "income you’re used to living on, and allows you to look forward to a higher income

  retirement plans, like 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and 457s, allow you to\r\n"
- "contribute funds directly from your paycheck before they’re taxed. There’s a double

  perfect retirement looks different to everyone.  For some, it’s simple living in
  a bungalow on a beach, while others envision a globetrotting\r\nexistence. Many
  simply want to stay in their long-time home, surrounded by friends and family.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShare

  matter what your perfect retirement looks like, it’s easier than you think to get
  there. By focusing on a few key elements of your investing plan, a little re-adjusting
  today can get you to your dream sooner than you think. We’ve boiled it down to 9
  key things that add up to a healthier investment strategy and safer retirement\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1.
  \  Diversify your portfolio to help minimize risk and maximize returnsWhy it’s important:
  \r\nWe’d all love to have been the smart investors who got in early on Apple or
  Google and\r\nheld on to this day. Unfortunately, years of analysis on investors,
  managers, and the market\r\nhas shown that most investors, including the pros, just
  aren’t good at picking stocks. Most\r\ninvestors also simply aren’t good at timing
  or predicting the market. Research from\r\nDALBAR shows that investors can essentially
  be their own worst enemy, typically giving up\r\n4% a year in returns relative to
  the overall performance of the stock market. 4% may not\r\nsound like much, but
  it equates to losing $10,000 every single year on a $250,000 portfolio! \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere’s
  no need to throw up your hands and assume that investing is too complicated to be
  worth\r\nit. Diversifying your portfolio by holding investments comprised of a wide
  range of companies and\r\ngeographies will help you smooth out your returns over
  time, go a long way toward matching the\r\nmarkets’ performance, and maybe even
  outperform some of your fellow investors.\r\nDiversification is a core tenet of
  Modern Portfolio Theory, a tried and tested approach to investing,\r\nbased on Nobel
  prize winning research, and is used by many portfolio managers. It works on two\r\nlevels:
  1. Asset Class Different asset classes do well in different situations and they
  each play a specific role in a portfolio.\r\nThe main asset classes in which we
  invest at FutureAdvisor are stocks, bonds, real estate, and inflation\r\nprotected
  securities. Together, these offer growth as well as the potential to preserve capital
  during\r\n1. Diversify your portfolio to help\r\nminimize risk and maximize returns\r\nPage

  markets. We often see in the news when the U.S. markets are doing well, but check
  out this\r\ninteresting infographic to see how various asset classes stack up over
  the last 15 years. 2. Geography The market may be soaring in India, but plummeting
  in Greece. Broad international exposure can help\r\nmanage this risk, which should
  expose you to bull markets wherever they may occur\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHere’s the takeaway:
  \ When constructing your retirement portfolio, aim to diversify by asset class and
  geography while\r\nkeeping your investing fees low, (more on keeping fees low, next).
  Unfortunately, many investors\r\nbelieve they are well diversified but instead have
  far too much money invested in the U.S., missing out\r\non global diversification.
  This phenomenon is known as “Home Bias” and it is exhibited by investors\r\naround
  the globe. Don’t be one of them!\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCurious how diversification could
  work within your portfolio? For an example of a\r\npersonalized allocation based
  on the above tenets, sign up for free.  In less than 2 minutes,\r\nyou’ll get personalized
  diversification recommendations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2. Minimize your investment feesWhy
  it’s important: \r\nYou get what you pay for -- right? Actually...it turns out that
  this isn’t really the case when it\r\ncomes to investments. A growing body of evidence
  shows that funds with higher expenses\r\ndo not, on average, perform better than
  lower-expense funds. In fact, research indicates the\r\naverage actively-managed
  fund performs worse than a low-cost index fund.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInvestment fees come
  in 3 main flavors:1. Trading Fees. These are the fees investors are charged when
  they buy or sell a stock, fund, or other asset.\r\nThe actual cost can vary greatly,
  depending on the broker the investor is using, and these\r\nfees can add up if an
  investor is actively trading. Commissions are a large part of trading\r\ncosts,
  but bid/ask spreads and the tax implications can also drive up your costs if you
  trade\r\noften. How to keep trading fees low: Invest using commission-free ETFs
  offered through brokers\r\nlike TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, Vanguard, and Charles Schwab.
  Since ETFs are comprised of a\r\nbasket of individual stocks, but is traded like
  a common stock, and has the added benefit of\r\ndiversification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t2.
  Fund FeesThese are the fees charged by the managers of the ETFs and Mutual Funds.
  Fund fees can\r\ntypically range from 0.2%-2.0%. They are typically comprised of
  a management fee (what\r\n2. Minimize your investment fees\r\nPage 6 of 16 9 Core
  Retirement Tactics To Help You Retire Sooner | FutureAdvisor\r\nthey charge for
  picking the equities which the fund is made up of), administrative costs (what\r\nthey
  charge for customer service, record keeping, etc.), and 12B-1 fees (what they charge\r\nfor
  advertising the fund to people like you). Some mutual funds also charge load fees
  when\r\nyou buy or sell the fund, these have declined in recent years but can average
  1% of your\r\ninvestment, ETFs don’t have these load fees. How to keep fund fees
  low: Invest using low fee ETFs, instead of higher fee mutual funds.\r\nBecause ETFs
  often require significantly less management and sales support, they are less\r\nexpensive
  to operate, and that savings is passed on to you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Advisor FeesThese
  are the fees a financial professional will charge you for providing financial guidance\r\nand
  making trades on your behalf. Most advisors charge their clients based on the amount\r\nof
  assets they are managing for the client. These fees are often 1% or more, and can
  take a\r\nlarge bite out of your total portfolio assets.How to keep advisor fees
  low: If you’re not a DIY’er, and heck, most of us are not - especially when it comes
  to investing, consider using a digital investment advisor (sometimes referred to
  as a Robo-Advisor). The advisor fee is often half the cost of a traditional advisor
  with no downside. Some, like FutureAdvisor, even give you access to a licensed financial
  advisor on staff if you need hand-holding, or have complex questions. When shopping
  for a roboadvisor, don’t necessarily go with the cheapest option, after all, this
  is your nest egg! Be sure you understand what services are being offered and what
  access to a licensed advisor the company offers. Think about it like this, you wouldn’t
  go with the cheapest tattoo artist, or heart surgeon, for that matter. Protect your
  future generations’ wealth with quality advice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHere's the takeaway:
  \ Always pay attention to how much your investments are costing you - after all,
  your goal in investing\r\nis to grow your pool of funds as much as you can. Anything
  that comes out of your pocket today\r\nis money that isn’t available to grow in
  the future. Compounded over time, fees can make a huge\r\ndifference in what you
  have available when it comes time for retirement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDo you
  know what fees are costing you? \n\t\t\t\tFind out in under 2 minutes\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3.
  Invest Idle CashWhy It's Important: Investing on your own can feel overwhelming.
  When you’re not sure of the best path\r\nforward, it may feel like the safest thing
  to do with your cash is simply nothing, at least until\r\nyou come across something
  you feel confident about investing in. Or you may not feel that\r\nit’s the right
  time to enter the market, thinking it’s better to wait for a dip so you can “buy\r\nlow.”
  However, the data shows that trying to time the market doesn’t work much better\r\nthan
  flipping a coin. If you factor in inflation, it turns out that the S&P 500 has been
  within\r\n10% of it’s “highest point ever” for over 60% of the time since 1980!\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnfortunately,
  as you’ll remember from earlier, research has shown that trying to time the market
  doesn’t work. Instead, make regular contributions to your investment accounts, over
  time, and as you have excess cash to put to work for you. While it’s impossible
  to predict the market, at least you’ll avoid the certainty of losing to inflation
  that comes with keeping money in cash. And since the market generally rises over
  time, why bet on paying higher prices in the future?Here's the takeaway: Make sure
  you set aside enough cash for emergency needs, and invest the rest. Don’t try to
  time the\r\nmarket.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4. Consider Rolling Over Your Old 401(k)sWhy it’s
  important:  Quick -- what fund fees are you currently paying for the money you have
  in a 401(k)? How about the admin fees? And how many investment choices are available
  to you? If you’re not sure of the answers, you’re not alone. Given that the average
  American now changes jobs every 4.6 years, it’s easy to lose track of old 401(k)s
  when you begin a new job -- it can feel like the last thing on your mind as you
  adjust to a new role and haggle over a new salary. However, slowly but surely losing
  your hard-saved money to compounding fees over time can make a huge impact on your
  future account balances. So, don’t be thinking just about your new compensation
  package when you switch jobs -- take advantage of the opportunity to consider rolling
  over your old 401(k) to a Rollover IRA account so you can minimize a whole wealth
  of fees: trading, commissions, management, and so on. And don’t forget that you’ll
  almost certainly gain access to a wider set of funds than was available within the
  confines of your 401(k).\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHere's the takeaway:  If you have an old 401(k),
  there’s a decent chance you’re overpaying, and you have fewer investing\r\noptions.
  Don’t delay, consider rolling it over into an IRA today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5.  Take strategic
  advantage of accounts like\r\n401(k)s, Roth IRAs, and 403(b)s where your\r\ninvestments
  can grow tax-freeWhy it’s important: We now all know that holding a diversified
  portfolio is smart, but, did you know that it matters\r\nwhere you hold those assets?
  Both taxable (e.g. a brokerage account) and tax-advantaged\r\n(e.g. 401(k), Roth
  IRA) accounts are key components of an ideal retirement strategy.\r\nHowever, some
  types of investments are better suited to one type of account over others.\r\nFor
  instance, investments that pay dividends are best kept in tax-advantaged accounts,
  so\r\nthat dividends aren’t taxed before they’re reinvested. Here's the takeaway:
  A well-diversified portfolio includes multiple types of assets, which ideally should
  be strategically\r\nallocated across both taxable and non-taxable accounts in order
  to minimize taxes overall. Consider\r\nworking with a digital investment advisor,
  like FutureAdvisor, who will automatically take your account\r\ntypes into consideration
  when deciding how to allocate 12 asset classes across your portfolio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMore

  \ Tax-Loss Harvest your portfolio to\r\nfurther reduce your taxesWhy it's important:
  No one likes to see their portfolio holdings drop in value, but that comes with
  the territory\r\nof investing -- over the short term, it’s going to happen. However,
  there’s a silver lining to\r\nthese often temporary drops -- it’s possible to take
  advantage of dips in the market through\r\na tactic called Tax-Loss Harvesting (TLH).
  TLH allows you to sell a losing investment, capture the losses on paper, and purchase
  a similar\r\ninvestment so your portfolio remains well-diversified. The losses that
  you capture via TLH can be used\r\nto offset capital gains elsewhere in your portfolio,
  or offset your income if you have no gains that year.To Tax-Loss Harvest effectively,
  it’s best to watch the market frequently -- even daily -- to identify\r\nopportunities
  where your positions have dropped in value and can be sold. This can be a cumbersome\r\nprocess
  to undertake on your own, and potentially tax-harmful, if not done correctly. But
  this is\r\nsomething that can easily be done by a computer. You can read a lot more
  about TLH here.Here's the takeaway:  Take advantage of TLH, but do it with care.
  It may be best to work with an automated advisor, like\r\nFutureAdvisor, who can
  track your investments in real time to take advantage of TLH opportunities,\r\nand
  ensure it’s done in a tax-optimal way. The average FutureAdvisor client sees a 0.50%*\r\nimprovement
  in annual returns due to TLH. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t7.  Save 10-20% of your incomeWhy it's
  important:  How much is the right amount to save for retirement? The answer depends
  somewhat based\r\non factors like your income, household finances, time to retirement,
  and current assets.\r\nHowever, broadly speaking, saving more today is doubly beneficial
  as it reduces the level of\r\nincome you’re used to living on, and allows you to
  look forward to a higher income in the\r\nfuture. If you’re under 30, then saving
  10% of your income, if you invest it appropriately,\r\nshould enable you maintain
  a similar standard of living through your retirement as you\r\nexperience when you
  are working. If you start later in life, then you may need to save more.Here's the
  takeaway:  As a general rule of thumb, save 10%-20% of your pre-tax income. Saving
  early and often can have a\r\nlarge impact on the size of your portfolio at retirement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWill
  you have enough money when you retire?\n\t\t\t\tFind Out Now\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t8.
  \ Save into a 401(k) plan to save on taxesWhy it's important:  Employer-sponsored
  retirement plans, like 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and 457s, allow you to\r\ncontribute funds
  directly from your paycheck before they’re taxed. There’s a double benefit\r\nhere
  in that your overall tax bill is decreased, and that the money is taken out of your\r\npaycheck
  before you even have the chance to miss it.Here’s what you need to know about 401(k)s
  in one table:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHere's the takeaway:  If you have the option to participate
  in your employers 401(k), take advantage of it - especially if your employer offers
  a contribution matching benefit. Matching equates to a guaranteed 100% return on
  your investment, something that is impossible to find elsewhere. Ideally, tax-advantaged
  employersponsored plans will comprise just one element of your retirement strategy,
  with taxable accounts supplementing your savings (and allowing for a mix of accounts
  to draw down from in retirement).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t9.  Save into a Roth IRA account
  to take\r\nadvantage of tax-free growth Why it's important:  A Roth IRA allows you
  to pay the taxes on your investment upfront, and pay nothing,\r\nincluding all the
  growth from it, when you withdrawal at retirement. In addition, if you move\r\ninto
  a higher income tax bracket at retirement, which many people do as they increase
  their\r\nearnings over the course of their life, you get the benefit of paying the
  taxes on the original\r\ninvestment at the income bracket tax rate they were in
  at that time. Studies indicate that\r\ninvestors typically earn more spendable income
  from investing through a Roth IRA over a\r\nTraditional IRA due to tax bracket changes.How
  do a Roth and a Traditional IRA differ?\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNot eligible for a Roth IRA
  due to your income level? First, congratulations on being in a higher\r\nincome
  bracket! Because higher income tends to come with higher tax bills, this means that
  taking\r\nadvantage of other tax-sheltered accounts like a 401(k) or 403(b) is even
  more important. You may\r\nconsider opening a “Backdoor Roth IRA,” something that
  FutureAdvisor can help you with.Here's the takeaway:  If you’re eligible, invest
  using a Roth IRA in addition to other tax-advantaged options, like your\r\ncompany
  401(k) to keep more of your hard earned cash. If you’re not eligible, consider utilizing
  a\r\n‘backdoor Roth IRA’\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt’s easy to get overwhelmed with the details

  perfect retirement looks different to everyone.  For some, it’s simple living in
  a bungalow on a beach, while others envision a globetrotting\r\nexistence. Many
  simply want to stay in their long-time home, surrounded by friends and family.No
  matter what your perfect retirement looks like, it’s easier than you think to get
  there. By focusing on a few key elements of your investing plan, a little re-adjusting
  today can get you to your dream sooner than you think. We’ve boiled it down to 9
  key things that add up to a healthier investment strategy and safer retirementWhy
  it’s important: \r\nWe’d all love to have been the smart investors who got in early
  on Apple or Google and\r\nheld on to this day. Unfortunately, years of analysis
  on investors, managers, and the market\r\nhas shown that most investors, including
  the pros, just aren’t good at picking stocks. Most\r\ninvestors also simply aren’t
  good at timing or predicting the market. Research from\r\nDALBAR shows that investors
  can essentially be their own worst enemy, typically giving up\r\n4% a year in returns
  relative to the overall performance of the stock market. 4% may not\r\nsound like
  much, but it equates to losing $10,000 every single year on a $250,000 portfolio!
  There’s no need to throw up your hands and assume that investing is too complicated
  to be worth\r\nit. Diversifying your portfolio by holding investments comprised
  of a wide range of companies and\r\ngeographies will help you smooth out your returns
  over time, go a long way toward matching the\r\nmarkets’ performance, and maybe
  even outperform some of your fellow investors.\r\nDiversification is a core tenet
  of Modern Portfolio Theory, a tried and tested approach to investing,\r\nbased on
  Nobel prize winning research, and is used by many portfolio managers. It works on
  two\r\nlevels: 1. Asset Class Different asset classes do well in different situations
  and they each play a specific role in a portfolio.\r\nThe main asset classes in
  which we invest at FutureAdvisor are stocks, bonds, real estate, and inflation\r\nprotected
  securities. Together, these offer growth as well as the potential to preserve capital
  during\r\n1. Diversify your portfolio to help\r\nminimize risk and maximize returns\r\nPage

  markets. We often see in the news when the U.S. markets are doing well, but check
  out this\r\ninteresting infographic to see how various asset classes stack up over
  the last 15 years. 2. Geography The market may be soaring in India, but plummeting
  in Greece. Broad international exposure can help\r\nmanage this risk, which should
  expose you to bull markets wherever they may occurWhy it’s important: \r\nYou get
  what you pay for -- right? Actually...it turns out that this isn’t really the case
  when it\r\ncomes to investments. A growing body of evidence shows that funds with
  higher expenses\r\ndo not, on average, perform better than lower-expense funds.
  In fact, research indicates the\r\naverage actively-managed fund performs worse
  than a low-cost index fund.Investment fees come in 3 main flavors:1. Trading Fees.
  These are the fees investors are charged when they buy or sell a stock, fund, or
  other asset.\r\nThe actual cost can vary greatly, depending on the broker the investor
  is using, and these\r\nfees can add up if an investor is actively trading. Commissions
  are a large part of trading\r\ncosts, but bid/ask spreads and the tax implications
  can also drive up your costs if you trade\r\noften. How to keep trading fees low:
  Invest using commission-free ETFs offered through brokers\r\nlike TD Ameritrade,
  Fidelity, Vanguard, and Charles Schwab. Since ETFs are comprised of a\r\nbasket
  of individual stocks, but is traded like a common stock, and has the added benefit
  of\r\ndiversification. These are the fees charged by the managers of the ETFs and
  Mutual Funds. Fund fees can\r\ntypically range from 0.2%-2.0%. They are typically
  comprised of a management fee (what\r\n2. Minimize your investment fees\r\nPage

  charge for picking the equities which the fund is made up of), administrative costs
  (what\r\nthey charge for customer service, record keeping, etc.), and 12B-1 fees
  (what they charge\r\nfor advertising the fund to people like you). Some mutual funds
  also charge load fees when\r\nyou buy or sell the fund, these have declined in recent
  years but can average 1% of your\r\ninvestment, ETFs don’t have these load fees.
  How to keep fund fees low: Invest using low fee ETFs, instead of higher fee mutual
  funds.\r\nBecause ETFs often require significantly less management and sales support,
  they are less\r\nexpensive to operate, and that savings is passed on to you.3. Advisor
  FeesThese are the fees a financial professional will charge you for providing financial
  guidance\r\nand making trades on your behalf. Most advisors charge their clients
  based on the amount\r\nof assets they are managing for the client. These fees are
  often 1% or more, and can take a\r\nlarge bite out of your total portfolio assets.How
  to keep advisor fees low: If you’re not a DIY’er, and heck, most of us are not -
  especially when it comes to investing, consider using a digital investment advisor
  (sometimes referred to as a Robo-Advisor). The advisor fee is often half the cost
  of a traditional advisor with no downside. Some, like FutureAdvisor, even give you
  access to a licensed financial advisor on staff if you need hand-holding, or have
  complex questions. When shopping for a roboadvisor, don’t necessarily go with the
  cheapest option, after all, this is your nest egg! Be sure you understand what services
  are being offered and what access to a licensed advisor the company offers. Think
  about it like this, you wouldn’t go with the cheapest tattoo artist, or heart surgeon,
  for that matter. Protect your future generations’ wealth with quality advice.Here's
  the takeaway:  Always pay attention to how much your investments are costing you
  - after all, your goal in investing\r\nis to grow your pool of funds as much as
  you can. Anything that comes out of your pocket today\r\nis money that isn’t available
  to grow in the future. Compounded over time, fees can make a huge\r\ndifference
  in what you have available when it comes time for retirement.Why It's Important:
  Investing on your own can feel overwhelming. When you’re not sure of the best path\r\nforward,
  it may feel like the safest thing to do with your cash is simply nothing, at least
  until\r\nyou come across something you feel confident about investing in. Or you
  may not feel that\r\nit’s the right time to enter the market, thinking it’s better
  to wait for a dip so you can “buy\r\nlow.” However, the data shows that trying to
  time the market doesn’t work much better\r\nthan flipping a coin. If you factor
  in inflation, it turns out that the S&P 500 has been within\r\n10% of it’s “highest
  point ever” for over 60% of the time since 1980!Unfortunately, as you’ll remember
  from earlier, research has shown that trying to time the market doesn’t work. Instead,
  make regular contributions to your investment accounts, over time, and as you have
  excess cash to put to work for you. While it’s impossible to predict the market,
  at least you’ll avoid the certainty of losing to inflation that comes with keeping
  money in cash. And since the market generally rises over time, why bet on paying
  higher prices in the future?Here's the takeaway: Make sure you set aside enough
  cash for emergency needs, and invest the rest. Don’t try to time the\r\nmarket.Why
  it’s important:  Quick -- what fund fees are you currently paying for the money
  you have in a 401(k)? How about the admin fees? And how many investment choices
  are available to you? If you’re not sure of the answers, you’re not alone. Given
  that the average American now changes jobs every 4.6 years, it’s easy to lose track
  of old 401(k)s when you begin a new job -- it can feel like the last thing on your
  mind as you adjust to a new role and haggle over a new salary. However, slowly but
  surely losing your hard-saved money to compounding fees over time can make a huge
  impact on your future account balances. So, don’t be thinking just about your new
  compensation package when you switch jobs -- take advantage of the opportunity to
  consider rolling over your old 401(k) to a Rollover IRA account so you can minimize
  a whole wealth of fees: trading, commissions, management, and so on. And don’t forget
  that you’ll almost certainly gain access to a wider set of funds than was available
  within the confines of your 401(k).Here's the takeaway:  If you have an old 401(k),
  there’s a decent chance you’re overpaying, and you have fewer investing\r\noptions.
  Don’t delay, consider rolling it over into an IRA today.Why it’s important: We now
  all know that holding a diversified portfolio is smart, but, did you know that it
  matters\r\nwhere you hold those assets? Both taxable (e.g. a brokerage account)
  and tax-advantaged\r\n(e.g. 401(k), Roth IRA) accounts are key components of an
  ideal retirement strategy.\r\nHowever, some types of investments are better suited
  to one type of account over others.\r\nFor instance, investments that pay dividends
  are best kept in tax-advantaged accounts, so\r\nthat dividends aren’t taxed before
  they’re reinvested. Here's the takeaway: A well-diversified portfolio includes multiple
  types of assets, which ideally should be strategically\r\nallocated across both
  taxable and non-taxable accounts in order to minimize taxes overall. Consider\r\nworking
  with a digital investment advisor, like FutureAdvisor, who will automatically take
  your account\r\ntypes into consideration when deciding how to allocate 12 asset
  classes across your portfolio.\n\t\t\tWhy it's important: No one likes to see their
  portfolio holdings drop in value, but that comes with the territory\r\nof investing
  -- over the short term, it’s going to happen. However, there’s a silver lining to\r\nthese
  often temporary drops -- it’s possible to take advantage of dips in the market through\r\na
  tactic called Tax-Loss Harvesting (TLH). TLH allows you to sell a losing investment,
  capture the losses on paper, and purchase a similar\r\ninvestment so your portfolio
  remains well-diversified. The losses that you capture via TLH can be used\r\nto
  offset capital gains elsewhere in your portfolio, or offset your income if you have
  no gains that year.To Tax-Loss Harvest effectively, it’s best to watch the market
  frequently -- even daily -- to identify\r\nopportunities where your positions have
  dropped in value and can be sold. This can be a cumbersome\r\nprocess to undertake
  on your own, and potentially tax-harmful, if not done correctly. But this is\r\nsomething
  that can easily be done by a computer. You can read a lot more about TLH here.Here's
  the takeaway:  Take advantage of TLH, but do it with care. It may be best to work
  with an automated advisor, like\r\nFutureAdvisor, who can track your investments
  in real time to take advantage of TLH opportunities,\r\nand ensure it’s done in
  a tax-optimal way. The average FutureAdvisor client sees a 0.50%*\r\nimprovement
  in annual returns due to TLH. Why it's important:  How much is the right amount
  to save for retirement? The answer depends somewhat based\r\non factors like your
  income, household finances, time to retirement, and current assets.\r\nHowever,
  broadly speaking, saving more today is doubly beneficial as it reduces the level
  of\r\nincome you’re used to living on, and allows you to look forward to a higher
  income in the\r\nfuture. If you’re under 30, then saving 10% of your income, if
  you invest it appropriately,\r\nshould enable you maintain a similar standard of
  living through your retirement as you\r\nexperience when you are working. If you
  start later in life, then you may need to save more.Here's the takeaway:  As a general
  rule of thumb, save 10%-20% of your pre-tax income. Saving early and often can have
  a\r\nlarge impact on the size of your portfolio at retirement.Why it's important:
  \ Employer-sponsored retirement plans, like 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and 457s, allow you
  to\r\ncontribute funds directly from your paycheck before they’re taxed. There’s
  a double benefit\r\nhere in that your overall tax bill is decreased, and that the
  money is taken out of your\r\npaycheck before you even have the chance to miss it.Here’s
  what you need to know about 401(k)s in one table:Why it's important:  A Roth IRA
  allows you to pay the taxes on your investment upfront, and pay nothing,\r\nincluding
  all the growth from it, when you withdrawal at retirement. In addition, if you move\r\ninto
  a higher income tax bracket at retirement, which many people do as they increase
  their\r\nearnings over the course of their life, you get the benefit of paying the
  taxes on the original\r\ninvestment at the income bracket tax rate they were in
  at that time. Studies indicate that\r\ninvestors typically earn more spendable income
  from investing through a Roth IRA over a\r\nTraditional IRA due to tax bracket changes.How
  do a Roth and a Traditional IRA differ?Not eligible for a Roth IRA due to your income
  level? First, congratulations on being in a higher\r\nincome bracket! Because higher
  income tends to come with higher tax bills, this means that taking\r\nadvantage
  of other tax-sheltered accounts like a 401(k) or 403(b) is even more important.
  You may\r\nconsider opening a “Backdoor Roth IRA,” something that FutureAdvisor
  can help you with.Here's the takeaway:  If you’re eligible, invest using a Roth
  IRA in addition to other tax-advantaged options, like your\r\ncompany 401(k) to
  keep more of your hard earned cash. If you’re not eligible, consider utilizing a\r\n‘backdoor
  Roth IRA’By following these 9 Core Tactics, you can stay confident that you’re on
  the right path, so you can focus on the other things in life that matter.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPlease
