- "    country of East Asia. It is the largest of all Asian countries and has the
  largest population of any country in the world. Occupying nearly the entire East
  Asian landmass, it occupies approximately one-fourteenth of the land area of Earth.
  Among the major countries of the world, China is surpassed in area by only Russia
  and Canada, and it is almost as large as the whole of Europe.Shanghai: financial
  district© Jeremy Woodhouse/Getty ImagesChina has 33 administrative units directly
  under the central government; these consist of 22 provinces, 5 autonomous regions,
  4 municipalities (Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin), and 2 special administrative
  regions (Hong Kong and Macau). The island province of Taiwan, which has been under
  separate administration since 1949, is discussed in the article Taiwan. Beijing
  (Peking), the capital of the People’s Republic, is also the cultural, economic,
  and communications centre of the country. Shanghai is the main industrial city;
  Hong Kong is the leading commercial centre and port.Within China’s boundaries exists
  a highly diverse and complex country. Its topography encompasses the highest and
  one of the lowest places on Earth, and its relief varies from nearly impenetrable
  mountainous terrain to vast coastal lowlands. Its climate ranges from extremely
  dry, desertlike conditions in the northwest to tropical monsoon in the southeast,
  and China has the greatest contrast in temperature between its northern and southern
  borders of any country in the world.The diversity of both China’s relief and its
  climate has resulted in one of the world’s widest arrays of ecological niches, and
  these niches have been filled by a vast number of plant and animal species. Indeed,
  practically all types of Northern Hemisphere plants, except those of the polar tundra,
  are found in China, and, despite the continuous inroads of humans over the millennia,
  China still is home to some of the world’s most exotic animals.Probably the single
  most identifiable characteristic of China to the people of the rest of the world
  is the size of its population. Some one-fifth of humanity is of Chinese nationality.
  The great majority of the population is Chinese (Han), and thus China is often characterized
  as an ethnically homogeneous country, but few countries have as wide a variety of
  indigenous peoples as does China. Even among the Han there are cultural and linguistic
  differences between regions; for example, the only point of linguistic commonality
  between two individuals from different parts of China may be the written Chinese
  language. Because China’s population is so enormous, the population density of the
  country is also often thought to be uniformly high, but vast areas of China are
  either uninhabited or sparsely populated.Great Wall of ChinaContunico © ZDF Enterprises
  GmbH, MainzWith more than 4,000 years of recorded history, China is one of the few
  existing countries that also flourished economically and culturally in the earliest
  stages of world civilization. Indeed, despite the political and social upheavals
  that frequently have ravaged the country, China is unique among nations in its longevity
  and resilience as a discrete politico-cultural unit. Much of China’s cultural development
  has been accomplished with relatively little outside influence, the introduction
  of Buddhism from India constituting a major exception. Even when the country was
  penetrated by such “barbarian” peoples as the Manchu, these groups soon became largely
  absorbed into the fabric of Han Chinese culture.This relative isolation from the
  outside world made possible over the centuries the flowering and refinement of the
  Chinese culture, but it also left China ill prepared to cope with that world when,
  from the mid-19th century, it was confronted by technologically superior foreign
  nations. There followed a century of decline and decrepitude, as China found itself
  relatively helpless in the face of a foreign onslaught. The trauma of this external
  challenge became the catalyst for a revolution that began in the early 20th century
  against the old regime and culminated in the establishment of a communist government
  in 1949. This event reshaped global political geography, and China has since come
  to rank among the most influential countries in the world.Central to China’s long-enduring
  identity as a unitary country is the province, or sheng (“secretariat”). The provinces
  are traceable in their current form to the Tang dynasty (ad 618–907). Over the centuries,
  provinces gained in importance as centres of political and economic authority and
  increasingly became the focus of regional identification and loyalty. Provincial
  power reached its peak in the first two decades of the 20th century, but, since
  the establishment of the People’s Republic, that power has been curtailed by a strong
  central leadership in Beijing. Nonetheless, while the Chinese state has remained
  unitary in form, the vast size and population of China’s provinces—which are comparable
  to large and midsize nations—dictate their continuing importance as a level of subnational
  administration.LandChinaChina stretches for about 3,250 miles (5,250 km) from east
  to west and 3,400 miles (5,500 km) from north to south. Its land frontier is about
  12,400 miles (20,000 km) in length, and its coastline extends for some 8,700 miles
  (14,000 km). The country is bounded by Mongolia to the north; Russia and North Korea
  to the northeast; the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea to the east; the South China
  Sea to the southeast; Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar (Burma), India, Bhutan, and Nepal to
  the south; Pakistan to the southwest; and Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and
  Kazakhstan to the west. In addition to the 14 countries that border directly on
  it, China also faces South Korea and Japan, across the Yellow Sea, and the Philippines,
  which lie beyond the South China Sea.ReliefKyrgyz: mosqueDugald Bremner/StoneBroadly
  speaking, the relief of China is high in the west and low in the east; consequently,
  the direction of flow of the major rivers is generally eastward. The surface may
  be divided into three steps, or levels. The first level is represented by the Plateau
  of Tibet, which is located in both the Tibet Autonomous Region and the province
  of Qinghai and which, with an average elevation of well over 13,000 feet (4,000
  metres) above sea level, is the loftiest highland area in the world. The western
  part of this region, the Qiangtang, has an average height of 16,500 feet (5,000
  metres) and is known as the “roof of the world.”The second step lies to the north
  of the Kunlun and Qilian mountains and (farther south) to the east of the Qionglai
  and Daliang ranges. There the mountains descend sharply to heights of between 6,000
  and 3,000 feet (1,800 and 900 metres), after which basins intermingle with plateaus.
  This step includes the Mongolian Plateau, the Tarim Basin, the Loess Plateau (loess
  is a yellow-gray dust deposited by the wind), the Sichuan Basin, and the Yunnan-Guizhou
  (Yungui) Plateau.The third step extends from the east of the Dalou, Taihang, and
  Wu mountain ranges and from the eastern perimeter of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau
  to the China Sea. Almost all of this area is made up of hills and plains lying below
  1,500 feet (450 metres).The most remarkable feature of China’s relief is the vast
  extent of its mountain chains; the mountains, indeed, have exerted a tremendous
  influence on the country’s political, economic, and cultural development. By rough
  estimate, about one-third of the total area of China consists of mountains. China
  has the world’s tallest mountain and the world’s highest and largest plateau, in
  addition to possessing extensive coastal plains. The five major landforms—mountain,
  plateau, hill, plain, and basin—are all well represented. China’s complex natural
  environment and rich natural resources are closely connected with the varied nature
  of its relief.The topography of China is marked by many splendours. Mount Everest
  (Qomolangma Feng), situated on the border between China and Nepal, is the highest
  peak in the world, at an elevation of 29,035 feet (8,850 metres; see Researcher’s
  Note: Height of Mount Everest). By contrast, the lowest part of the Turfan Depression
  in the Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang—Lake Ayding—is 508 feet (155 metres)
  below sea level. The coast of China contrasts greatly between South and North. To
  the south of the bay of Hangzhou, the coast is rocky and indented with many harbours
  and offshore islands. To the north, except along the Shandong and Liaodong peninsulas,
  the coast is sandy and flat.China is prone to intense seismic activity throughout
  much of the country. The main source of this geologic instability is the result
  of the constant northward movement of the Indian tectonic plate beneath southern
  Asia, which has thrust up the towering mountains and high plateaus of the Chinese
  southwest. Throughout its history China has experienced hundreds of massive earthquakes
  that collectively have killed millions of people. Two in the 20th century alone—in
  eastern Gansu province (1920) and in the city of Tangshan, eastern Hebei province
  (1976)—caused some 250,000 deaths each, and a quake in east-central Sichuan province
  in 2008 killed tens of thousands and devastated a wide area.China’s physical relief
  has dictated its development in many respects. The civilization of Han Chinese originated
  in the southern part of the Loess Plateau, and from there it extended outward until
  it encountered the combined barriers of relief and climate. The long, protruding
  corridor, commonly known as the Gansu, or Hexi, Corridor, illustrates this fact.
  South of the corridor is the Plateau of Tibet, which was too high and too cold for
  the Chinese to gain a foothold. North of the corridor is the Gobi Desert, which
  also formed a barrier. Consequently, Chinese civilization was forced to spread along
  the corridor, where melting snow and ice in the Qilian Mountains provided water
  for oasis farming. The westward extremities of the corridor became the meeting place
  of the ancient East and West.Thus, for a long time the ancient political centre
  of China was located along the lower reaches of the Huang He (Yellow River). Because
  of topographical barriers, however, it was difficult for the central government
  to gain complete control over the entire country, except when an unusually strong
  dynasty was in power. In many instances the Sichuan Basin—an isolated region in
  southwestern China, about twice the size of Scotland, that is well protected by
  high mountains and is self-sufficient in agricultural products—became an independent
  kingdom. A comparable situation often arose in the Tarim Basin in the northwest.
  Linked to the rest of China only by the Gansu Corridor, this basin is even remoter
  than the Sichuan, and, when the central government was unable to exert its influence,
  oasis states were established; only the three strong dynasties—the Han (206 bc–ad
  220), the Tang (ad 618–907), and the Qing, or Manchu (1644–1911/12)—were capable
  of controlling the region.Apart from the three elevation zones already mentioned,
  it is possible—on the basis of geologic structure, climatic conditions, and differences
  in geomorphologic development—to divide China into three major topographic regions:
  the eastern, northwestern, and southwestern zones. The eastern zone is shaped by
  the rivers, which have eroded landforms in some parts and have deposited alluvial
  plains in others; its climate is monsoonal (characterized by seasonal rain-bearing
  winds). The northwestern region is arid and eroded by the wind; it forms an inland
  drainage basin. The southwest is a cold, lofty, and mountainous region containing
  intermontane plateaus and inland lakes.The three basic regions may be further subdivided
  into second-order geographic divisions. The eastern region contains 10 of these,
  the southwest contains two, and the northwest contains three. Below is a brief description
  of each division.The eastern regionThe Northeast PlainDa Hinggan RangeRichard Harrington/ComstockThe
  Northeast Plain (also known as the Manchurian Plain and the Sung-liao Plain) is
  located in China’s Northeast, the region formerly known as Manchuria. It is bordered
  to the west and north by the Da Hinggan (Greater Khingan) Range and to the east
  by the Xiao Hinggan (Lesser Khingan) Range. An undulating plain split into northern
  and southern halves by a low divide rising from 500 to 850 feet (150 to 260 metres),
  it is drained in its northern part by the Sungari River and tributaries and in its
  southern part by the Liao River. Most of the area has an erosional rather than a
  depositional surface, but it is covered with a deep soil. The plain has an area
  of about 135,000 square miles (350,000 square km). Its basic landscapes are forest-steppe,
  steppe, meadow-steppe, and cultivated land; its soils are rich and black, and it
  is a famous agricultural region. The river valleys are wide and flat with a series
  of terraces formed by deposits of silt. During the flood season the rivers inundate
  extensive areas.The Changbai MountainsTo the southeast of the Northeast Plain is
  a series of ranges comprising the Changbai, Zhangguangcai, and Wanda mountains,
  which in Chinese are collectively known as the Changbai Shan, or “Forever White
  Mountains”; broken by occasional open valleys, they reach elevations mostly between
  1,500 and 3,000 feet (450 and 900 metres). In some parts the scenery is characterized
  by rugged peaks and precipitous cliffs. The highest peak is the volcanic cone of
  Mount Baitou (9,003 feet [2,744 metres]), which has a beautiful crater lake at its
  snow-covered summit. As one of the major forest areas of China, the region is the
  source of many valuable furs and famous medicinal herbs. Cultivation is generally
  limited to the valley floors.The North China PlainComparable in size to the Northeast
  Plain, most of the North China Plain lies at elevations below 160 feet (50 metres),
  and the relief is monotonously flat. It was formed by enormous sedimentary deposits
  brought down by the Huang He and Huai River from the Loess Plateau; the Quaternary
  deposits alone (i.e., those from the past 2.6 million years) reach thicknesses of
  2,500 to 3,000 feet (760 to 900 metres). The river channels, which are higher than
  the surrounding locality, form local water divides, and the areas between the channels
  are depressions in which lakes and swamps are found. In particularly low and flat
  areas, the underground water table often fluctuates from 5 to 6.5 feet (1.5 to 2
  metres), forming meadow swamps and, in some places, resulting in saline soils. A
  densely populated area that has long been under settlement, the North China Plain
  has the highest proportion of land under cultivation of any region in China.The
  Loess PlateauYan RiverA.Topping—Rapho/Photo ResearchersThis vast plateau of some
  154,000 square miles (400,000 square km) forms a unique region of loess-clad hills
  and barren mountains between the North China Plain and the deserts of the west.
  In the north the Great Wall of China forms the boundary, while the southern limit
  is the Qin Mountains in Shaanxi province. The average surface elevation is roughly
  4,000 feet (1,200 metres), but individual ranges of bedrock are higher, reaching
  9,825 feet (2,995 metres) in the Liupan Mountains. Most of the plateau is covered
  with loess to thicknesses of 165 to 260 feet (50 to 80 metres). In northern Shaanxi
  and eastern Gansu provinces, the loess may reach much greater thicknesses. The loess
  is particularly susceptible to erosion by water, and ravines and gorges crisscross
  the plateau. It has been estimated that ravines cover approximately half the entire
  region, with erosion reaching depths of 300 to 650 feet (90 to 200 metres).The Shandong
  HillsThese hills are basically composed of extremely ancient crystalline shales
  and granites of early Precambrian age (i.e., older than about 2.5 billion years)
  and of somewhat younger sedimentary rocks dating to about 540–420 million years
  ago. Faults have played a major role in creating the present relief, and, as a result,
  many hills are horsts (blocks of the Earth’s crust uplifted along faults), while
  the valleys have been formed by grabens (blocks of the Earth’s crust that have been
  thrust down along faults). The Jiaolai Plain divides this region into two parts.
  The eastern part is lower, lying at elevations averaging below 1,500 feet (450 metres),
  with only certain peaks and ridges rising to 2,500 feet and (rarely) to 3,000 feet
  (900 metres); the highest point, Mount Lao, reaches 3,714 feet (1,132 metres). The
  western part is slightly higher, rising to 5,000 feet (1,524 metres) at Mount Tai,
  one of China’s most sacred mountains. The Shandong Hills meet the sea along a rocky
  and indented shoreline.The Qin MountainsThe Qin (conventional Tsinling) Mountains
  in Shaanxi province are the greatest chain of mountains east of the Plateau of Tibet.
  The mountain chain consists of a high and rugged barrier extending from Gansu to
  Henan; geographers use a line between the chain and the Huai River to divide China
  proper into two parts—North and South. The elevation of the mountains varies from
  3,000 to 10,000 feet (900 to 3,000 metres). The western part is higher, with the
  highest peak, Mount Taibai, rising to 12,359 feet (3,767 metres). The Qin Mountains
  consist of a series of parallel ridges, all running roughly west-east, separated
  by a maze of ramifying valleys whose canyon walls often rise sheer to a height of
  1,000 feet (300 metres) above the valley streams.The Sichuan BasinThis is one of
  the most attractive geographical regions of China. The Sichuan Basin is surrounded
  by mountains, which are higher in the west and north. Protected against the penetration
  of cold northern winds, the basin is much warmer in the winter than are the more
  southerly plains of southeast China. Except for the Chengdu Plain, the region is
  hilly. The relief of the basin’s eastern half consists of numerous folds, forming
  a series of ridges and valleys that trend northeast to southwest. The lack of arable
  land has obliged farmers to cultivate the slopes of the hills, on which they have
  built terraces that frequently cover the slopes from top to bottom. The terracing
  has slowed down the process of erosion and has made it possible to cultivate additional
  areas by using the steeper slopes—some of which have grades up to 45° or more.The
  southeastern mountainsSoutheastern China is bordered by a rocky shoreline backed
  by picturesque mountains. In general, there is a distinct structural and topographic
  trend from northeast to southwest. The higher peaks may reach elevations of some
  5,000 to 6,500 feet (1,500 to 2,000 metres). The rivers are short and fast-flowing
  and have cut steep-sided valleys. The chief areas of settlement are on narrow strips
  of coastal plain where rice is produced. Along the coast there are numerous islands,
  where the fishing industry is well developed.Plains of the middle and lower YangtzeEast
  of Yichang, in Hubei province, a series of plains of uneven width are found along
  the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang). The plains are particularly wide in the delta area
  and in places where the Yangtze receives its major tributaries—including large areas
  of lowlands around Dongting, Poyang, Tai, and Hongze lakes, which are all hydrologically
  linked with the Yangtze. The region is an alluvial plain, the accumulation of sediment
  laid down by the rivers throughout long ages. There are a few isolated hills, but
  in general the land is level, lying mostly below 160 feet (50 metres). Rivers, canals,
  and lakes form a dense network of waterways. The surface of the plain has been converted
  into a system of flat terraces, which descend in steps along the slopes of the valleys.The
  Nan MountainsThe Nan Mountains (Nan Ling) are composed of many ranges of mountains
  running from northeast to southwest. These ranges form the watershed between the
  Yangtze to the north and the Pearl (Zhu) River to the south. The main peaks along
  the watershed are above 5,000 feet, and some are more than 6,500 feet. But a large
  part of the land to the south of the Nan Mountains is also hilly; flatland does
  not exceed 10 percent of the total area. The Pearl River Delta is the only extensive
  plain in this region and is also the richest part of South China. The coastline
  is rugged and irregular, and there are many promontories and protected bays, including
  those of Hong Kong and Macau. The principal river is the Xi River, which rises in
  the highlands of eastern Yunnan and southern Guizhou.The southwestThe Yunnan-Guizhou
  PlateauThis region comprises the northern part of Yunnan and the western part of
  Guizhou; its edge is highly dissected. Yunnan is more distinctly a plateau and contains
  larger areas of rolling uplands than Guizhou, but both parts are distinguished by
  canyonlike valleys and precipitous mountains. The highest elevations lie in the
  west, where Mount Diancang (also called Cang Shan) rises to 13,524 feet (4,122 metres).
  In the valleys of the major rivers, elevations drop to about 1,300 to 1,600 feet
  (400 to 490 metres). Particularly sharp differences in elevation and the greatest
  ruggedness of relief occur in the western part of the region, in the gorges of the
  large rivers. In the eastern part, karst processes (creating sinks, ravines, and
  underground streams in the limestone landscape) have developed very strongly. Scattered
  throughout the highlands are small lake basins, separated by mountains.The Plateau
  of TibetBrahmaputra River: stupa© Naomi Duguid/Asia AccessThis great upland massif
  occupies about one-fourth of the country’s area. A large part of the plateau lies
  at elevations above 13,000 to 16,500 feet (4,000 to 5,000 metres). The border ranges
  of the plateau (the Kunlun Mountains and the Himalayas) are even higher, with individual
  peaks rising to heights of 23,000 to 26,000 feet (7,000 to 8,000 metres) and higher.
  As a rule, the interior (i.e., Tibet-side) slopes of these border mountains are
  gentle, while the exterior slopes are precipitous. The plateau’s eastern and southern
  periphery is the source of many of the world’s great rivers, including the Yangtze,
  Huang He, Mekong, Salween, Indus, and Brahmaputra. Only in the low valleys, chiefly
  along the Brahmaputra valley, are there centres of human settlement.The Qaidam (Tsaidam)
  Basin, occupying the northwestern portion of the Plateau of Tibet, is the largest,
  as well as the lowest, depression in the plateau. The broad northwestern part of
  the basin lies at elevations between approximately 8,800 and 10,000 feet (2,700
  and 3,000 metres), and the narrow southeastern part is slightly lower. Gravel, sandy
  and clay deserts, semideserts, and salt wastes predominate within the basin.The
  northwestThe Tarim BasinKunlun Mountains© Jeffrey Alford/Asia AccessNorth of the
  Plateau of Tibet and at the much lower elevation of about 3,000 feet (900 metres)
  lies the Tarim Basin. It is hemmed in by great mountain ranges: the Tien Shan (Tian
  Shan; “Celestial Mountains”) on the north, the Pamirs on the west, and the Kunlun
  Mountains on the south. Glacier-fed streams descend from these heights only to lose
  themselves in the loose sands and gravels of the Takla Makan Desert, which occupies
  the centre of the basin. The Takla Makan is one of the most barren of the world’s
  deserts; only a few of the largest rivers—such as the Tarim and Hotan (Khotan)—cross
  the desert, but even their flow is not constant, and they have water throughout
  their entire courses only during the flood period. The area of the basin is about
  215,000 square miles (557,000 square km), and its elevations range from 2,500 to
  4,600 feet (750 to 1,400 metres) above sea level. Its surface slants to the southeast,
  where Lop Nur (a salt-encrusted lake bed) is situated.The Junggar BasinNorth of
  the Tarim Basin is another large depression, the Junggar (Dzungarian) Basin. It
  is enclosed by the Tien Shan on the south, while to the northeast it is cut off
  from Mongolia by the Altai Mountains. The surface of the basin is flat, with a gentle
  slope to the southwest. The larger portion of the land lies at elevations between
  about 1,000 and 1,500 feet (300 and 450 metres), and in the lowest part the elevation
  drops to just below 650 feet (200 metres). In general the main part of the basin
  is covered by a broad desert with barchans (crescent-shaped sand dunes that move);
  only in certain parts are dunes retained by vegetation.The Tien ShanBogda MountainsK.
  Scholz/Shostal AssociatesThe Chinese (eastern) part of the Tien Shan consists of
  a complex system of ranges and depressions divided into two major groups of ranges:
  the northern and the southern. The groups are separated by a strip of intermontane
  depressions that itself is broken up by the interior ranges. Ancient metamorphic
  rock constitutes the larger portion of the ranges in the interior zone; Paleozoic
  (i.e., about 250 to 540 million years old) sedimentary and igneous sedimentary beds
  form its northern and southern chains, while Mesozoic (about 65 to 250 million years
  old) sandstones and conglomerates fill the intermontane depressions in the interior
  zone and constitute the foothill ridges. The height of the main Chinese chains of
  the Tien Shan is between 13,000 and 15,000 feet (4,000 and 4,600 metres), with individual
  peaks exceeding 16,000 feet (4,900 metres); the interior chains reach 14,500 feet
  (4,400 metres). In the western part, where precipitation is adequate, large glaciers
  are formed, reaching a length of more than 20 miles (32 km). Large rivers with heavy
  flows, such as the Ili (Yili) River and its tributaries, begin their courses there,
  and the predominantly alpine meadow steppe is one of the best grazing lands of China.DrainageHuang
  He: junks on the Huang HeTim Megarry/Robert Harding Picture LibraryChina has more
  than 50,000 rivers with individual drainage areas exceeding 40 square miles (100
  square km). Of the total annual runoff, about 95 percent drains directly into the
  sea (more than 80 percent into the Pacific Ocean, 12 percent into the Indian Ocean,
  and less than 1 percent into the Arctic Ocean) and 5 percent disappears inland.The
  three principal rivers of China, all of which flow generally from west to east,
  draining into the China Sea, are the Huang He, the Yangtze, and the Xi. The Huang
  He, which rises in the Kunlun Mountains, is the northernmost of the three; it drains
  into the Bo Hai (Gulf of Chihli), north of the Shandong Peninsula. The Yangtze,
  the longest river in the country, rises in the Tibetan Highlands and flows across
  central China, draining into the East China Sea north of Shanghai. The Xi River,
  the southernmost of the three, rises in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and empties into
  the South China Sea via the Pearl River Delta at Guangzhou (Canton).The distribution
  of surface water in China is extremely uneven. Only a small part of the country
  has sufficient quantities year-round. Much of the country has abundant runoff but
  only during the rainy summer, when enormous surpluses of water are received. From
  the southeast to the northwest, the surface water decreases as the relief becomes
  more mountainous. A vast area of the northwest lacks water throughout the year.
  North China (north of the Qin Mountains–Huai River line), with its flat relief and
  long history of agriculture, contains almost two-thirds of China’s cultivated land;
  paradoxically, because of scanty and erratic precipitation, the average annual runoff
  in the North accounts for only about one-sixth of the total for the country as a
  whole.The mountains of the southeast and the mountainous Hainan Island have the
  most abundant surface water. Over the year they receive more than 60 inches (1,500
  mm) of precipitation (in some places even more than 80 inches [2,000 mm]), of which
  almost two-thirds constitutes the runoff, so that a dense drainage network has developed.
  The amount of runoff is highest in the southeast, exceeding 40 inches (1,000 mm).
  It gradually diminishes toward the west and north, so that in the true deserts of
  the northwest it is usually less than 0.4 of an inch (10 mm). The arid climate of
  the northwest is reflected in the landscape of the dry steppes, which is characterized
  by richer grasses in the east, while in the west the landscape gradually changes
  to bare deserts.In the lower reaches of the Yangtze, the Pearl River Delta, and
  the Chengdu Plain a dense network of waterways has been developed. In the North
  China Plain and the Northeast Plain most of the rivers have a linear flow, and tributaries
  are few and unconnected. In the inland drainage area there are very few rivers because
  of scanty precipitation. Extensive areas such as the Tarim Basin and northeastern
  Gansu province are often completely devoid of runoff. In those regions the rivers
  depend on melted snow and ice; in consequence, they are mostly small and are found
  only in mountains and mountain foothills. As they drain increasingly farther away
  from the mountains, most of them eventually disappear in the desert, while some
  form inland lakes. Because the northern part of the Plateau of Tibet is a cold desert,
  the rate of evaporation is slow, so that a denser network of rivers has developed;
  most of these, however, run into glaciated depressions, forming numerous lakes.SoilsChina,
  with its vast and diverse climatic conditions, has a wide variety of soils. Indeed,
  all the soil types of the Eurasian continent, except the soils of the tundra and
  the highly leached podzolic-gley soils of the northern taiga (boreal forest), are
  found in China. As a result of the climatic differences between the drier and cooler
  North and the wetter and hotter South, soils may be grouped into two classifications.
  Generally speaking, the soils north of the Qin Mountains–Huai River line are pedocals
  (calcareous) and are neutral to alkaline in reaction; those south of this line are
  pedalfers (leached noncalcareous soils), which are neutral to acid.Apart from the
  great plateaus and high mountains to the southwest, marked soil zones are formed
  in China according to differences in climate, vegetation, and distance from the
  sea. The east and southeast coastal region is covered by the forest zone associated
  with a humid and semihumid climate, while the north and northwest inland regions
  belong mostly to the steppe zone, as well as to the semidesert and desert zone associated
  with a semiarid and arid climate. Between these two broad soil zones lies a transitional
  zone—the forest-steppe zone, where forest soils merge gradually with steppe soils.Between
  the pedocals of the North and the pedalfers of the South lie the neutral soils.
  The floodplain of the Yangtze below the Three Gorges (the point where the river
  cuts through the Wu Mountains to empty onto the Hubei Plain) is overlain with a
  thick cover of noncalcareous alluvium. These soils, sometimes classified as paddy
  (rice-growing) soils, for the most part are exceedingly fertile and of good texture.
  The paddy soil is a unique type of cultivated soil, formed over a long period of
  time under the specific conditions of intensive rice cultivation.Along the coast
  of North China are belts of saline and alkaline soil. They are associated with a
  combination of poor drainage and aridity, where precipitation is insufficient either
  to dissolve or to carry away the salts in solution.The adverse effects of nature
  on the soil have been further intensified by centuries of concentrated cultivation,
  which has resulted in an almost universal deficiency of nitrogen and organic matter.
  The shortage of organic matter is primarily because farmers habitually remove crop
  stalks and leaves for livestock feed and fuel. The animal and human waste used for
  fertilizer contains too small an amount of organic matter to compensate for the
  loss of nutrients in the soil. The soils are also often deficient in phosphorus
  and potassium, but these deficiencies are neither so widespread nor so severe as
  that of nitrogen.At one time, half of the territory of present-day China may have
  been covered by forests, but now less than one-tenth of the country is forested.
  Extensive forests in central and southern China were cleared for farmlands, resulting
  in the inevitable erosion of soils from the hillsides and their deposition in the
  valleys. Farmers have constructed level terraces, supported by walls, in order to
  hold back water for rice fields, thus effectively controlling erosion. Wherever
  elaborate terraces have been built, soil erosion is virtually absent, and stepped
  terraces have become one of the characteristic features of the rural landscape.Excessive
  grazing and other practices that destroy the grass cover have also produced soil
  loss. When its valuable crumb structure is broken down and its porosity is lost,
  the topsoil is easily washed away through erosion in the rainy season; the wind
  produces the same effect in dry regions. The Loess Plateau, constantly buffeted
  by rain and wind, is especially vulnerable to soil erosion, which results in a distinctive
  landscape. Deep, steep-sided gullies cut the plateau into fantastic relief. The
  damage done by heavy rain in summer includes not only topsoil loss but also frequent
  flooding by silt-laden rivers.ClimateThe air massesThe vast and topographically
  varied landmass of China lies in Asia, the world’s largest continent, and faces
  the Pacific, the world’s largest ocean, along an extensive shoreline. The country’s
  climate is thus heavily influenced by the seasonal movement of large air masses
  between the Pacific and the Chinese mainland. The polar continental air mass, originating
  to the north in Siberia, dominates a large part of China during the winter; likewise,
  the tropical Pacific air mass exerts its influence during the summer. The sharply
  varied climatic conditions prevailing in summer and in winter are a direct result
  of the interaction of these two air masses, which are entirely different in nature.The
  Siberian air mass, which is quite stable, is extremely cold and dry and often has
  marked layers of temperature inversion. After crossing the Mongolian Plateau, the
  air mass spreads southward and begins to invade North China, where it undergoes
  a series of rapid changes; its temperature rises slightly, and its stability decreases.
  During the day the air there may be quite warm, but at night or in shaded places
  the cold is often unbearable. In general, the diurnal (daily) range of temperature
  is more than 18 °F (10 °C); in extreme cases it may exceed 45 °F (25 °C). Because
  North China is affected by this air mass most of the time, it is dry, with clear
  weather and an abundance of sunshine during the winter months.The prevailing winter
  wind blows from November through March, but it changes direction as it moves to
  the south. In northern and northeastern China its direction is from the northwest,
  in eastern China it comes from the north, and on the southeastern coasts it is from
  the northeast. The height of the winter wind belt usually does not exceed 13,000
  feet (4,000 metres). As it moves to the south, the height decreases; in Nanjing
  it is about 6,500 feet (2,000 metres), and in South China it is less than 5,000
  feet (1,500 metres). The Qin Mountains become an effective barrier to the advance
  of the cold waves to the south, particularly in the western section, where the average
  elevation of the mountains is mainly between 6,500 and 9,000 feet (2,000 and 2,700
  metres).In China the tropical Pacific air mass is the chief source of summer rainfall.
  When it predominates, it may cover the eastern half of China and penetrate deep
  into the border areas of the Mongolian Plateau and onto the eastern edge of the
  Plateau of Tibet. In summer the Siberian air mass retreats to the western end of
  Mongolia, although it occasionally penetrates southward and sometimes may reach
  the Huai River valley, which constitutes a summertime battleground between the tropical
  Pacific and Siberian air masses.The movement of the two air masses is of immense
  significance to the climate of central and North China. In summer, when the tropical
  air mass predominates, the frontal zone between the two shifts northward; as a result,
  North China receives heavier rainfall. When the southeastern monsoon slackens, however,
  the frontal zone moves southward, and central China receives more rainfall, which
  can cause flooding. The activity of the tropical Pacific air mass in winter is confined
  to the southeast coastal areas; during that season, therefore, it frequently drizzles
  in the hilly areas south of the Nan Mountains, and morning fog is common.Besides
  these two air masses, three other air masses also influence China’s climate: the
  equatorial continental air mass (a highly unstable southwest monsoon), the polar
  maritime air mass, and the equatorial maritime air mass. Furthermore, because China
  is so vast and has such complex topography, the interaction between the air masses
  and relief produces a wide range of climatic conditions.TemperatureTemperatures
  generally decrease from south to north. The mean annual temperature is above 68
  °F (20 °C) in the Pearl River valley. It decreases to between 59 and 68 °F (15 and
  20 °C) in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze, to about 50 °F (10 °C) in
  North China and the southern part of Xinjiang, and to 41 °F (5 °C) in the southern
  area of the Northeast, the northern part of Xinjiang, and places near the Great
  Wall. It drops below 32 °F (0 °C; i.e., freezing) in the northern part of Heilongjiang.
  The annual range of temperature between the extreme south and north is about 86
  °F (48 °C). With few exceptions, January is the coldest month and July is the hottest.South
  of the Qin Mountains–Huai River line, the mean January temperature increases progressively,
  rising from freezing to 72 °F (22 °C) on the southern coast of Hainan Island. Snow
  rarely falls, and the rivers do not freeze. North of this line, the temperature
  drops from freezing to −18 °F (−28 °C) in the northern part of Heilongjiang.In April
  the mean temperature is above freezing for the whole of China, with the exception
  of extreme northern Heilongjiang. During that time the mean temperature for the
  Northeast Plain is between 36 and 46 °F (2 and 8 °C), and for the extensive plain
  between Beijing and Shanghai it is between 54 and 59 °F (12 and 15 °C). South of
  the Nan Mountains the mean temperature is considerably higher than 68 °F (20 °C).
  Along the coast of southern Guangdong, willows start to bud in late January, but
  in Beijing the budding of willows comes as late as early April.In summer the temperature
  range between North and South China is quite small. In July the difference in temperature
  between Guangzhou and Beijing is only about 5 °F (3 °C), and the isotherms in July
  are roughly parallel to the coastline. In July the isotherm of 82 °F (28 °C) marks
  an extensive area. The hottest places in China are found along the valleys of the
  middle and lower Yangtze. The mean July temperature of Nanchang and Changsha is
  well above 84 °F (29 °C), and in many years it exceeds 86 °F (30 °C).In North China
  autumn is generally cooler than spring. The mean October temperature in Beijing
  is about 55 °F (13 °C), and in April it is about 57 °F (14 °C). In South China the
  reverse is true. The mean October temperature in Guangzhou is 75 °F (24 °C), but
  in April it is only about 70 °F (21 °C).The middle and lower reaches of the Huang
  He are where China’s civilization and agriculture first developed. There the seasonal
  rhythm is well marked, and the duration of each season is evenly spaced. In other
  parts of China, however, the duration as well as the starting and closing dates
  of each season vary among different regions. Summer is nonexistent in northern Heilongjiang,
  while there is no winter in southern Guangdong. At Kunming, in the Yunnan uplands,
  the climate is mild throughout the year, with only brief summer and winter periods.In
  general, south of the Qin Mountains–Huai River line the mean daily temperature seldom
  falls below freezing, so that farming can be practiced year-round. In the Yangtze
  valley two crops are usually grown annually, but north of the Great Wall only one
  crop per year is possible.PrecipitationPrecipitation in China generally follows
  the same pattern as temperatures, decreasing from the southeast to the northwest.
  The annual total of certain areas along the southeastern coast amounts to more than
  80 inches (2,000 mm). The Yangtze valley receives about 40 to 45 inches (1,000 to
  1,150 mm). Farther north, in the Huai River valley, the annual rainfall decreases
  to some 35 inches (880 mm). In the lower reaches of the Huang He, only 20 to 25
  inches (500 to 650 mm) falls annually. The Northeast generally receives more precipitation
  than the North China Plain, with upwards of 40 or more inches falling in the Changbai
  Mountains.The southeast monsoon loses much of its moisture by the time it reaches
  the northern part of the Loess Plateau, where the annual precipitation is reduced
  to between 12 and 20 inches (300 and 500 mm). Northwest of a line linking the Da
  Hinggan (Greater Khingan), Yin, Lang, Qilian, and Altun ranges, the annual precipitation
  is less than 10 inches (250 mm). Because these regions are far from the sea, high
  mountains prevent the southern monsoon from reaching them, and only grasslands are
  found there. In western Inner Mongolia, the Gansu Corridor, and the Tarim Basin,
  the annual precipitation drops to 4 inches (100 mm) or less. These are areas of
  true desert, where sometimes not a single drop of moisture is received for several
  years.The Junggar Basin and the Ili River valley of northern Xinjiang are open to
  the influences of the westerlies, and precipitation is heavier there. Precipitation
  on the Plateau of Tibet, following the national pattern, decreases from southeast
  to northwest. More than 40 inches falls annually in the valleys in the southeastern
  part of the plateau, and the eastern edge receives 20 inches. However, in the enclosed
  Qaidam Basin in the north, the yearly total is only 4 to 10 inches.The high variability
  of precipitation is another characteristic of China’s climate. Usually, variability
  increases as annual amounts decrease, a circumstance that is closely connected with
  the country’s high frequency of drought and flood. Spring rain is of immense significance
  to Chinese farmers, but spring is also the season with the highest variability.
  In South China the variability exceeds 40 percent, along the Yangtze it is about
  45 percent, and in North China it is more than 50 percent. The variability of a
  vast area in North China exceeds 70 percent in some places; east of Beijing, for
  example, the rainfall variability in spring may even exceed 80 percent, as it also
  does in the central parts of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau.Rain falls mostly in the
  summer months, when plants need water the most. This is an important asset for farmers,
  but summer rainfall is usually too intense. In July, when the frontal zone shifts
  northward, cyclones (circulation of winds around centres of low atmospheric pressure)
  are much more active in North China than in South China, and North China begins
  to receive heavier rainfall. More than half the area of the North China Plain records
  0.8 inch (20 mm) of rainfall daily, and in some places it may reach as much as 1
  inch (25 mm) or more daily. During that time, areas south of the Yangtze are covered
  by the tropical Pacific air mass, so that the weather becomes comparatively stable,
  the amount of rainfall usually decreases, and the average rainfall intensity is
  less than that of June. The intensity of August rainfall is in general less than
  that of July.In the southeastern coastal regions, around Fuzhou and Shantou, the
  maximum daily rainfall may even approach 12 inches (300 mm). Such accumulations
  are directly related to the high frequency of typhoons (tropical cyclones) striking
  that part of the coast, usually during the period from May to November; July, August,
  and September are the three months when typhoons are the most frequent.In May, typhoons
  usually strike the coast south of Shantou. Later in June they shift northward, arriving
  between Shantou and Wenzhou, and after July they invade areas north of Wenzhou.
  August has the highest frequency of typhoon invasions, when more than one-third
  of the typhoons reaching China arrive. After September the frequency of typhoons
  decreases, and the pattern again shifts southward. In October, typhoons usually
  land south of Wenzhou; the late typhoons arriving in November and December strike
  south of Shantou.Plant and animal lifeFlorabambooJoan Lebold Cohen/Photo ResearchersChina’s
  great topological and climatic diversity has produced a vast array of natural vegetation
  types. The country’s total number of seed-plant species is approximately 30,000,
  representing some 2,700 genera; more than 200 of these genera are endemic to China.
  There are about 2,500 species of forest trees, including some 95 percent of the
  known broad-leaved types. Many of these trees are of economic importance, such as
  tung trees, camphor trees, varnish trees (Rhus verniciflua), star anise (which yields
  an oil used as a flavouring additive), and glossy privet (Ligustrum lucidum).Contributing
  to the variety and intermixture of tropical and temperate plants in China are such
  factors as the lack of insurmountable topographic barriers, such as large stretches
  of desert, between the tropical, temperate, and subalpine zones; wind systems that
  alternate in winter and summer; and the frequent occurrence of cyclones. If, for
  example, the vegetation of Heilongjiang province in the North and of Guangdong province
  in the South are compared, it is hardly possible to find a single common plant species,
  with the exception of certain weeds. In the taiga (boreal forest) zone of China’s
  northern border region or in the high mountains, on the other hand, there are many
  plant species that are also found in the lands within the Arctic Circle, while in
  the Chinese tropics there are species that also grow south of the Equator. However,
  from the ecological point of view, the tropical forests of South China generally
  do not differ greatly from those of Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries,
  and the desert and steppe vegetation of northwestern China is closely akin to that
  found in Mongolia or Kazakhstan. Furthermore, the Chinese taiga terrain of the frontier
  area adjoining Russia is essentially the same as that of Siberia.A traveler in China
  may encounter practically all types of natural vegetation indigenous to the Northern
  Hemisphere, the exception being species of the polar tundra. There are mangrove
  swamps along the shores of the South China Sea; rainforests on Hainan Island and
  in southern Yunnan; and deserts, steppes, meadows, and savannas elsewhere, as well
  as regions where tropical and temperate coniferous and evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved
  plants prevail.China may be divided—roughly along a diagonal from the southwest
  to the northeast—into two sharply different vegetation zones: the dry northwest
  and the humid southeast. The tropical area, adjoining the humid southeast, is geographically
  related more to Southeast Asia. In the northwest, where desertlike conditions prevail,
  are vast areas of sparse drought-resistant vegetation; within these areas, in the
  low-lying land and depressions, are patches of salt-tolerant plants, notably in
  the Junngar, Qaidam, and Gobi regions. Skirting the southern edge of the Gobi is
  a wide belt of grassland.Animal lifeThe profusion of vegetation types and a variety
  of relief have allowed a great diversity of animal life to develop and have permitted
  animals to survive there that elsewhere are extinct. Notable among such survivals
  are the great paddlefish of the Yangtze, the species of small alligator in eastern
  and central China, and the giant salamander (related to the Japanese giant salamander
  and the American hellbender) in western China. The diversity of animal life is perhaps
  greatest in the ranges and valleys of Tibet and Sichuan, the latter province being
  renowned as the home of the giant panda. The takin (a type of goat antelope), numerous
  species of pheasants, and a variety of laughing thrushes are found in all Chinese
  mountain ranges. China seems to be one of the chief centres of dispersal of the
  carp family and also of old-world catfishes.The regional affinities of Chinese animal
  life are complex. Resemblances in the Northeast are to the fauna of the Siberian
  forests. Animals from Central Asia inhabit suitable steppe areas in northern China.
  The life of the great mountain ranges is Palearctic (relating to a biogeographic
  region that includes Europe, Asia north of the Himalayas, northern Arabia, and Africa
  north of the Sahara) but with distinctively Chinese species or genera. To the southeast
  the lowlands and mountains alike permit direct access to the eastern region. This
  part of China presents a complete transition from temperate-zone Palearctic life
  to the wealth of tropical forms distinctive of southeastern Asia. Tropical types
  of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals predominate in the southernmost Chinese
  provinces.\r\n"

      China, Chinese (Pinyin) Zhonghua or (Wade-Giles romanization) Chung-hua, also spelled (Pinyin) Zhongguo or (Wade-Giles romanization) Chung-kuo, officially People’s Republic of China, Chinese (Pinyin) Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo or (Wade-Giles romanization) Chung-hua Jen-min Kung-ho-kuo, 
- "    country of East Asia. It is the largest of all Asian countries and has the
  largest population of any country in the world. Occupying nearly the entire East
  Asian landmass, it occupies approximately one-fourteenth of the land area of Earth.
  Among the major countries of the world, China is surpassed in area by only Russia
  and Canada, and it is almost as large as the whole of Europe.Shanghai: financial
  district© Jeremy Woodhouse/Getty ImagesChina has 33 administrative units directly
  under the central government; these consist of 22 provinces, 5 autonomous regions,
  4 municipalities (Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin), and 2 special administrative
  regions (Hong Kong and Macau). The island province of Taiwan, which has been under
  separate administration since 1949, is discussed in the article Taiwan. Beijing
  (Peking), the capital of the People’s Republic, is also the cultural, economic,
  and communications centre of the country. Shanghai is the main industrial city;
  Hong Kong is the leading commercial centre and port.Within China’s boundaries exists
  a highly diverse and complex country. Its topography encompasses the highest and
  one of the lowest places on Earth, and its relief varies from nearly impenetrable
  mountainous terrain to vast coastal lowlands. Its climate ranges from extremely
  dry, desertlike conditions in the northwest to tropical monsoon in the southeast,
  and China has the greatest contrast in temperature between its northern and southern
  borders of any country in the world.The diversity of both China’s relief and its
  climate has resulted in one of the world’s widest arrays of ecological niches, and
  these niches have been filled by a vast number of plant and animal species. Indeed,
  practically all types of Northern Hemisphere plants, except those of the polar tundra,
  are found in China, and, despite the continuous inroads of humans over the millennia,
  China still is home to some of the world’s most exotic animals.Probably the single
  most identifiable characteristic of China to the people of the rest of the world
  is the size of its population. Some one-fifth of humanity is of Chinese nationality.
  The great majority of the population is Chinese (Han), and thus China is often characterized
  as an ethnically homogeneous country, but few countries have as wide a variety of
  indigenous peoples as does China. Even among the Han there are cultural and linguistic
  differences between regions; for example, the only point of linguistic commonality
  between two individuals from different parts of China may be the written Chinese
  language. Because China’s population is so enormous, the population density of the
  country is also often thought to be uniformly high, but vast areas of China are
  either uninhabited or sparsely populated.Great Wall of ChinaContunico © ZDF Enterprises
  GmbH, MainzWith more than 4,000 years of recorded history, China is one of the few
  existing countries that also flourished economically and culturally in the earliest
  stages of world civilization. Indeed, despite the political and social upheavals
  that frequently have ravaged the country, China is unique among nations in its longevity
  and resilience as a discrete politico-cultural unit. Much of China’s cultural development
  has been accomplished with relatively little outside influence, the introduction
  of Buddhism from India constituting a major exception. Even when the country was
  penetrated by such “barbarian” peoples as the Manchu, these groups soon became largely
  absorbed into the fabric of Han Chinese culture.This relative isolation from the
  outside world made possible over the centuries the flowering and refinement of the
  Chinese culture, but it also left China ill prepared to cope with that world when,
  from the mid-19th century, it was confronted by technologically superior foreign
  nations. There followed a century of decline and decrepitude, as China found itself
  relatively helpless in the face of a foreign onslaught. The trauma of this external
  challenge became the catalyst for a revolution that began in the early 20th century
  against the old regime and culminated in the establishment of a communist government
  in 1949. This event reshaped global political geography, and China has since come
  to rank among the most influential countries in the world.Central to China’s long-enduring
  identity as a unitary country is the province, or sheng (“secretariat”). The provinces
  are traceable in their current form to the Tang dynasty (ad 618–907). Over the centuries,
  provinces gained in importance as centres of political and economic authority and
  increasingly became the focus of regional identification and loyalty. Provincial
  power reached its peak in the first two decades of the 20th century, but, since
  the establishment of the People’s Republic, that power has been curtailed by a strong
  central leadership in Beijing. Nonetheless, while the Chinese state has remained
  unitary in form, the vast size and population of China’s provinces—which are comparable
  to large and midsize nations—dictate their continuing importance as a level of subnational
  administration.ChinaChina stretches for about 3,250 miles (5,250 km) from east to
  west and 3,400 miles (5,500 km) from north to south. Its land frontier is about
  12,400 miles (20,000 km) in length, and its coastline extends for some 8,700 miles
  (14,000 km). The country is bounded by Mongolia to the north; Russia and North Korea
  to the northeast; the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea to the east; the South China
  Sea to the southeast; Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar (Burma), India, Bhutan, and Nepal to
  the south; Pakistan to the southwest; and Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and
  Kazakhstan to the west. In addition to the 14 countries that border directly on
  it, China also faces South Korea and Japan, across the Yellow Sea, and the Philippines,
  which lie beyond the South China Sea.Kyrgyz: mosqueDugald Bremner/StoneBroadly speaking,
  the relief of China is high in the west and low in the east; consequently, the direction
  of flow of the major rivers is generally eastward. The surface may be divided into
  three steps, or levels. The first level is represented by the Plateau of Tibet,
  which is located in both the Tibet Autonomous Region and the province of Qinghai
  and which, with an average elevation of well over 13,000 feet (4,000 metres) above
  sea level, is the loftiest highland area in the world. The western part of this
  region, the Qiangtang, has an average height of 16,500 feet (5,000 metres) and is
  known as the “roof of the world.”The second step lies to the north of the Kunlun
  and Qilian mountains and (farther south) to the east of the Qionglai and Daliang
  ranges. There the mountains descend sharply to heights of between 6,000 and 3,000
  feet (1,800 and 900 metres), after which basins intermingle with plateaus. This
  step includes the Mongolian Plateau, the Tarim Basin, the Loess Plateau (loess is
  a yellow-gray dust deposited by the wind), the Sichuan Basin, and the Yunnan-Guizhou
  (Yungui) Plateau.The third step extends from the east of the Dalou, Taihang, and
  Wu mountain ranges and from the eastern perimeter of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau
  to the China Sea. Almost all of this area is made up of hills and plains lying below
  1,500 feet (450 metres).The most remarkable feature of China’s relief is the vast
  extent of its mountain chains; the mountains, indeed, have exerted a tremendous
  influence on the country’s political, economic, and cultural development. By rough
  estimate, about one-third of the total area of China consists of mountains. China
  has the world’s tallest mountain and the world’s highest and largest plateau, in
  addition to possessing extensive coastal plains. The five major landforms—mountain,
  plateau, hill, plain, and basin—are all well represented. China’s complex natural
  environment and rich natural resources are closely connected with the varied nature
  of its relief.The topography of China is marked by many splendours. Mount Everest
  (Qomolangma Feng), situated on the border between China and Nepal, is the highest
  peak in the world, at an elevation of 29,035 feet (8,850 metres; see Researcher’s
  Note: Height of Mount Everest). By contrast, the lowest part of the Turfan Depression
  in the Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang—Lake Ayding—is 508 feet (155 metres)
  below sea level. The coast of China contrasts greatly between South and North. To
  the south of the bay of Hangzhou, the coast is rocky and indented with many harbours
  and offshore islands. To the north, except along the Shandong and Liaodong peninsulas,
  the coast is sandy and flat.China is prone to intense seismic activity throughout
  much of the country. The main source of this geologic instability is the result
  of the constant northward movement of the Indian tectonic plate beneath southern
  Asia, which has thrust up the towering mountains and high plateaus of the Chinese
  southwest. Throughout its history China has experienced hundreds of massive earthquakes
  that collectively have killed millions of people. Two in the 20th century alone—in
  eastern Gansu province (1920) and in the city of Tangshan, eastern Hebei province
  (1976)—caused some 250,000 deaths each, and a quake in east-central Sichuan province
  in 2008 killed tens of thousands and devastated a wide area.China’s physical relief
  has dictated its development in many respects. The civilization of Han Chinese originated
  in the southern part of the Loess Plateau, and from there it extended outward until
  it encountered the combined barriers of relief and climate. The long, protruding
  corridor, commonly known as the Gansu, or Hexi, Corridor, illustrates this fact.
  South of the corridor is the Plateau of Tibet, which was too high and too cold for
  the Chinese to gain a foothold. North of the corridor is the Gobi Desert, which
  also formed a barrier. Consequently, Chinese civilization was forced to spread along
  the corridor, where melting snow and ice in the Qilian Mountains provided water
  for oasis farming. The westward extremities of the corridor became the meeting place
  of the ancient East and West.Thus, for a long time the ancient political centre
  of China was located along the lower reaches of the Huang He (Yellow River). Because
  of topographical barriers, however, it was difficult for the central government
  to gain complete control over the entire country, except when an unusually strong
  dynasty was in power. In many instances the Sichuan Basin—an isolated region in
  southwestern China, about twice the size of Scotland, that is well protected by
  high mountains and is self-sufficient in agricultural products—became an independent
  kingdom. A comparable situation often arose in the Tarim Basin in the northwest.
  Linked to the rest of China only by the Gansu Corridor, this basin is even remoter
  than the Sichuan, and, when the central government was unable to exert its influence,
  oasis states were established; only the three strong dynasties—the Han (206 bc–ad
  220), the Tang (ad 618–907), and the Qing, or Manchu (1644–1911/12)—were capable
  of controlling the region.Apart from the three elevation zones already mentioned,
  it is possible—on the basis of geologic structure, climatic conditions, and differences
  in geomorphologic development—to divide China into three major topographic regions:
  the eastern, northwestern, and southwestern zones. The eastern zone is shaped by
  the rivers, which have eroded landforms in some parts and have deposited alluvial
  plains in others; its climate is monsoonal (characterized by seasonal rain-bearing
  winds). The northwestern region is arid and eroded by the wind; it forms an inland
  drainage basin. The southwest is a cold, lofty, and mountainous region containing
  intermontane plateaus and inland lakes.The three basic regions may be further subdivided
  into second-order geographic divisions. The eastern region contains 10 of these,
  the southwest contains two, and the northwest contains three. Below is a brief description
  of each division.Da Hinggan RangeRichard Harrington/ComstockThe Northeast Plain
  (also known as the Manchurian Plain and the Sung-liao Plain) is located in China’s
  Northeast, the region formerly known as Manchuria. It is bordered to the west and
  north by the Da Hinggan (Greater Khingan) Range and to the east by the Xiao Hinggan
  (Lesser Khingan) Range. An undulating plain split into northern and southern halves
  by a low divide rising from 500 to 850 feet (150 to 260 metres), it is drained in
  its northern part by the Sungari River and tributaries and in its southern part
  by the Liao River. Most of the area has an erosional rather than a depositional
  surface, but it is covered with a deep soil. The plain has an area of about 135,000
  square miles (350,000 square km). Its basic landscapes are forest-steppe, steppe,
  meadow-steppe, and cultivated land; its soils are rich and black, and it is a famous
  agricultural region. The river valleys are wide and flat with a series of terraces
  formed by deposits of silt. During the flood season the rivers inundate extensive
  areas.To the southeast of the Northeast Plain is a series of ranges comprising the
  Changbai, Zhangguangcai, and Wanda mountains, which in Chinese are collectively
  known as the Changbai Shan, or “Forever White Mountains”; broken by occasional open
  valleys, they reach elevations mostly between 1,500 and 3,000 feet (450 and 900
  metres). In some parts the scenery is characterized by rugged peaks and precipitous
  cliffs. The highest peak is the volcanic cone of Mount Baitou (9,003 feet [2,744
  metres]), which has a beautiful crater lake at its snow-covered summit. As one of
  the major forest areas of China, the region is the source of many valuable furs
  and famous medicinal herbs. Cultivation is generally limited to the valley floors.Comparable
  in size to the Northeast Plain, most of the North China Plain lies at elevations
  below 160 feet (50 metres), and the relief is monotonously flat. It was formed by
  enormous sedimentary deposits brought down by the Huang He and Huai River from the
  Loess Plateau; the Quaternary deposits alone (i.e., those from the past 2.6 million
  years) reach thicknesses of 2,500 to 3,000 feet (760 to 900 metres). The river channels,
  which are higher than the surrounding locality, form local water divides, and the
  areas between the channels are depressions in which lakes and swamps are found.
  In particularly low and flat areas, the underground water table often fluctuates
  from 5 to 6.5 feet (1.5 to 2 metres), forming meadow swamps and, in some places,
  resulting in saline soils. A densely populated area that has long been under settlement,
  the North China Plain has the highest proportion of land under cultivation of any
  region in China.Yan RiverA.Topping—Rapho/Photo ResearchersThis vast plateau of some
  154,000 square miles (400,000 square km) forms a unique region of loess-clad hills
  and barren mountains between the North China Plain and the deserts of the west.
  In the north the Great Wall of China forms the boundary, while the southern limit
  is the Qin Mountains in Shaanxi province. The average surface elevation is roughly
  4,000 feet (1,200 metres), but individual ranges of bedrock are higher, reaching
  9,825 feet (2,995 metres) in the Liupan Mountains. Most of the plateau is covered
  with loess to thicknesses of 165 to 260 feet (50 to 80 metres). In northern Shaanxi
  and eastern Gansu provinces, the loess may reach much greater thicknesses. The loess
  is particularly susceptible to erosion by water, and ravines and gorges crisscross
  the plateau. It has been estimated that ravines cover approximately half the entire
  region, with erosion reaching depths of 300 to 650 feet (90 to 200 metres).These
  hills are basically composed of extremely ancient crystalline shales and granites
  of early Precambrian age (i.e., older than about 2.5 billion years) and of somewhat
  younger sedimentary rocks dating to about 540–420 million years ago. Faults have
  played a major role in creating the present relief, and, as a result, many hills
  are horsts (blocks of the Earth’s crust uplifted along faults), while the valleys
  have been formed by grabens (blocks of the Earth’s crust that have been thrust down
  along faults). The Jiaolai Plain divides this region into two parts. The eastern
  part is lower, lying at elevations averaging below 1,500 feet (450 metres), with
  only certain peaks and ridges rising to 2,500 feet and (rarely) to 3,000 feet (900
  metres); the highest point, Mount Lao, reaches 3,714 feet (1,132 metres). The western
  part is slightly higher, rising to 5,000 feet (1,524 metres) at Mount Tai, one of
  China’s most sacred mountains. The Shandong Hills meet the sea along a rocky and
  indented shoreline.The Qin (conventional Tsinling) Mountains in Shaanxi province
  are the greatest chain of mountains east of the Plateau of Tibet. The mountain chain
  consists of a high and rugged barrier extending from Gansu to Henan; geographers
  use a line between the chain and the Huai River to divide China proper into two
  parts—North and South. The elevation of the mountains varies from 3,000 to 10,000
  feet (900 to 3,000 metres). The western part is higher, with the highest peak, Mount
  Taibai, rising to 12,359 feet (3,767 metres). The Qin Mountains consist of a series
  of parallel ridges, all running roughly west-east, separated by a maze of ramifying
  valleys whose canyon walls often rise sheer to a height of 1,000 feet (300 metres)
  above the valley streams.This is one of the most attractive geographical regions
  of China. The Sichuan Basin is surrounded by mountains, which are higher in the
  west and north. Protected against the penetration of cold northern winds, the basin
  is much warmer in the winter than are the more southerly plains of southeast China.
  Except for the Chengdu Plain, the region is hilly. The relief of the basin’s eastern
  half consists of numerous folds, forming a series of ridges and valleys that trend
  northeast to southwest. The lack of arable land has obliged farmers to cultivate
  the slopes of the hills, on which they have built terraces that frequently cover
  the slopes from top to bottom. The terracing has slowed down the process of erosion
  and has made it possible to cultivate additional areas by using the steeper slopes—some
  of which have grades up to 45° or more.Southeastern China is bordered by a rocky
  shoreline backed by picturesque mountains. In general, there is a distinct structural
  and topographic trend from northeast to southwest. The higher peaks may reach elevations
  of some 5,000 to 6,500 feet (1,500 to 2,000 metres). The rivers are short and fast-flowing
  and have cut steep-sided valleys. The chief areas of settlement are on narrow strips
  of coastal plain where rice is produced. Along the coast there are numerous islands,
  where the fishing industry is well developed.East of Yichang, in Hubei province,
  a series of plains of uneven width are found along the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang).
  The plains are particularly wide in the delta area and in places where the Yangtze
  receives its major tributaries—including large areas of lowlands around Dongting,
  Poyang, Tai, and Hongze lakes, which are all hydrologically linked with the Yangtze.
  The region is an alluvial plain, the accumulation of sediment laid down by the rivers
  throughout long ages. There are a few isolated hills, but in general the land is
  level, lying mostly below 160 feet (50 metres). Rivers, canals, and lakes form a
  dense network of waterways. The surface of the plain has been converted into a system
  of flat terraces, which descend in steps along the slopes of the valleys.The Nan
  Mountains (Nan Ling) are composed of many ranges of mountains running from northeast
  to southwest. These ranges form the watershed between the Yangtze to the north and
  the Pearl (Zhu) River to the south. The main peaks along the watershed are above
  5,000 feet, and some are more than 6,500 feet. But a large part of the land to the
  south of the Nan Mountains is also hilly; flatland does not exceed 10 percent of
  the total area. The Pearl River Delta is the only extensive plain in this region
  and is also the richest part of South China. The coastline is rugged and irregular,
  and there are many promontories and protected bays, including those of Hong Kong
  and Macau. The principal river is the Xi River, which rises in the highlands of
  eastern Yunnan and southern Guizhou.This region comprises the northern part of Yunnan
  and the western part of Guizhou; its edge is highly dissected. Yunnan is more distinctly
  a plateau and contains larger areas of rolling uplands than Guizhou, but both parts
  are distinguished by canyonlike valleys and precipitous mountains. The highest elevations
  lie in the west, where Mount Diancang (also called Cang Shan) rises to 13,524 feet
  (4,122 metres). In the valleys of the major rivers, elevations drop to about 1,300
  to 1,600 feet (400 to 490 metres). Particularly sharp differences in elevation and
  the greatest ruggedness of relief occur in the western part of the region, in the
  gorges of the large rivers. In the eastern part, karst processes (creating sinks,
  ravines, and underground streams in the limestone landscape) have developed very
  strongly. Scattered throughout the highlands are small lake basins, separated by
  mountains.Brahmaputra River: stupa© Naomi Duguid/Asia AccessThis great upland massif
  occupies about one-fourth of the country’s area. A large part of the plateau lies
  at elevations above 13,000 to 16,500 feet (4,000 to 5,000 metres). The border ranges
  of the plateau (the Kunlun Mountains and the Himalayas) are even higher, with individual
  peaks rising to heights of 23,000 to 26,000 feet (7,000 to 8,000 metres) and higher.
  As a rule, the interior (i.e., Tibet-side) slopes of these border mountains are
  gentle, while the exterior slopes are precipitous. The plateau’s eastern and southern
  periphery is the source of many of the world’s great rivers, including the Yangtze,
  Huang He, Mekong, Salween, Indus, and Brahmaputra. Only in the low valleys, chiefly
  along the Brahmaputra valley, are there centres of human settlement.The Qaidam (Tsaidam)
  Basin, occupying the northwestern portion of the Plateau of Tibet, is the largest,
  as well as the lowest, depression in the plateau. The broad northwestern part of
  the basin lies at elevations between approximately 8,800 and 10,000 feet (2,700
  and 3,000 metres), and the narrow southeastern part is slightly lower. Gravel, sandy
  and clay deserts, semideserts, and salt wastes predominate within the basin.Kunlun
  Mountains© Jeffrey Alford/Asia AccessNorth of the Plateau of Tibet and at the much
  lower elevation of about 3,000 feet (900 metres) lies the Tarim Basin. It is hemmed
  in by great mountain ranges: the Tien Shan (Tian Shan; “Celestial Mountains”) on
  the north, the Pamirs on the west, and the Kunlun Mountains on the south. Glacier-fed
  streams descend from these heights only to lose themselves in the loose sands and
  gravels of the Takla Makan Desert, which occupies the centre of the basin. The Takla
  Makan is one of the most barren of the world’s deserts; only a few of the largest
  rivers—such as the Tarim and Hotan (Khotan)—cross the desert, but even their flow
  is not constant, and they have water throughout their entire courses only during
  the flood period. The area of the basin is about 215,000 square miles (557,000 square
  km), and its elevations range from 2,500 to 4,600 feet (750 to 1,400 metres) above
  sea level. Its surface slants to the southeast, where Lop Nur (a salt-encrusted
  lake bed) is situated.North of the Tarim Basin is another large depression, the
  Junggar (Dzungarian) Basin. It is enclosed by the Tien Shan on the south, while
  to the northeast it is cut off from Mongolia by the Altai Mountains. The surface
  of the basin is flat, with a gentle slope to the southwest. The larger portion of
  the land lies at elevations between about 1,000 and 1,500 feet (300 and 450 metres),
  and in the lowest part the elevation drops to just below 650 feet (200 metres).
  In general the main part of the basin is covered by a broad desert with barchans
  (crescent-shaped sand dunes that move); only in certain parts are dunes retained
  by vegetation.Bogda MountainsK. Scholz/Shostal AssociatesThe Chinese (eastern) part
  of the Tien Shan consists of a complex system of ranges and depressions divided
  into two major groups of ranges: the northern and the southern. The groups are separated
  by a strip of intermontane depressions that itself is broken up by the interior
  ranges. Ancient metamorphic rock constitutes the larger portion of the ranges in
  the interior zone; Paleozoic (i.e., about 250 to 540 million years old) sedimentary
  and igneous sedimentary beds form its northern and southern chains, while Mesozoic
  (about 65 to 250 million years old) sandstones and conglomerates fill the intermontane
  depressions in the interior zone and constitute the foothill ridges. The height
  of the main Chinese chains of the Tien Shan is between 13,000 and 15,000 feet (4,000
  and 4,600 metres), with individual peaks exceeding 16,000 feet (4,900 metres); the
  interior chains reach 14,500 feet (4,400 metres). In the western part, where precipitation
  is adequate, large glaciers are formed, reaching a length of more than 20 miles
  (32 km). Large rivers with heavy flows, such as the Ili (Yili) River and its tributaries,
  begin their courses there, and the predominantly alpine meadow steppe is one of
  the best grazing lands of China.Huang He: junks on the Huang HeTim Megarry/Robert
  Harding Picture LibraryChina has more than 50,000 rivers with individual drainage
  areas exceeding 40 square miles (100 square km). Of the total annual runoff, about
  95 percent drains directly into the sea (more than 80 percent into the Pacific Ocean,
  12 percent into the Indian Ocean, and less than 1 percent into the Arctic Ocean)
  and 5 percent disappears inland.The three principal rivers of China, all of which
  flow generally from west to east, draining into the China Sea, are the Huang He,
  the Yangtze, and the Xi. The Huang He, which rises in the Kunlun Mountains, is the
  northernmost of the three; it drains into the Bo Hai (Gulf of Chihli), north of
  the Shandong Peninsula. The Yangtze, the longest river in the country, rises in
  the Tibetan Highlands and flows across central China, draining into the East China
  Sea north of Shanghai. The Xi River, the southernmost of the three, rises in the
  Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and empties into the South China Sea via the Pearl River
  Delta at Guangzhou (Canton).The distribution of surface water in China is extremely
  uneven. Only a small part of the country has sufficient quantities year-round. Much
  of the country has abundant runoff but only during the rainy summer, when enormous
  surpluses of water are received. From the southeast to the northwest, the surface
  water decreases as the relief becomes more mountainous. A vast area of the northwest
  lacks water throughout the year. North China (north of the Qin Mountains–Huai River
  line), with its flat relief and long history of agriculture, contains almost two-thirds
  of China’s cultivated land; paradoxically, because of scanty and erratic precipitation,
  the average annual runoff in the North accounts for only about one-sixth of the
  total for the country as a whole.The mountains of the southeast and the mountainous
  Hainan Island have the most abundant surface water. Over the year they receive more
  than 60 inches (1,500 mm) of precipitation (in some places even more than 80 inches
  [2,000 mm]), of which almost two-thirds constitutes the runoff, so that a dense
  drainage network has developed. The amount of runoff is highest in the southeast,
  exceeding 40 inches (1,000 mm). It gradually diminishes toward the west and north,
  so that in the true deserts of the northwest it is usually less than 0.4 of an inch
  (10 mm). The arid climate of the northwest is reflected in the landscape of the
  dry steppes, which is characterized by richer grasses in the east, while in the
  west the landscape gradually changes to bare deserts.In the lower reaches of the
  Yangtze, the Pearl River Delta, and the Chengdu Plain a dense network of waterways
  has been developed. In the North China Plain and the Northeast Plain most of the
  rivers have a linear flow, and tributaries are few and unconnected. In the inland
  drainage area there are very few rivers because of scanty precipitation. Extensive
  areas such as the Tarim Basin and northeastern Gansu province are often completely
  devoid of runoff. In those regions the rivers depend on melted snow and ice; in
  consequence, they are mostly small and are found only in mountains and mountain
  foothills. As they drain increasingly farther away from the mountains, most of them
  eventually disappear in the desert, while some form inland lakes. Because the northern
  part of the Plateau of Tibet is a cold desert, the rate of evaporation is slow,
  so that a denser network of rivers has developed; most of these, however, run into
  glaciated depressions, forming numerous lakes.China, with its vast and diverse climatic
  conditions, has a wide variety of soils. Indeed, all the soil types of the Eurasian
  continent, except the soils of the tundra and the highly leached podzolic-gley soils
  of the northern taiga (boreal forest), are found in China. As a result of the climatic
  differences between the drier and cooler North and the wetter and hotter South,
  soils may be grouped into two classifications. Generally speaking, the soils north
  of the Qin Mountains–Huai River line are pedocals (calcareous) and are neutral to
  alkaline in reaction; those south of this line are pedalfers (leached noncalcareous
  soils), which are neutral to acid.Apart from the great plateaus and high mountains
  to the southwest, marked soil zones are formed in China according to differences
  in climate, vegetation, and distance from the sea. The east and southeast coastal
  region is covered by the forest zone associated with a humid and semihumid climate,
  while the north and northwest inland regions belong mostly to the steppe zone, as
  well as to the semidesert and desert zone associated with a semiarid and arid climate.
  Between these two broad soil zones lies a transitional zone—the forest-steppe zone,
  where forest soils merge gradually with steppe soils.Between the pedocals of the
  North and the pedalfers of the South lie the neutral soils. The floodplain of the
  Yangtze below the Three Gorges (the point where the river cuts through the Wu Mountains
  to empty onto the Hubei Plain) is overlain with a thick cover of noncalcareous alluvium.
  These soils, sometimes classified as paddy (rice-growing) soils, for the most part
  are exceedingly fertile and of good texture. The paddy soil is a unique type of
  cultivated soil, formed over a long period of time under the specific conditions
  of intensive rice cultivation.Along the coast of North China are belts of saline
  and alkaline soil. They are associated with a combination of poor drainage and aridity,
  where precipitation is insufficient either to dissolve or to carry away the salts
  in solution.The adverse effects of nature on the soil have been further intensified
  by centuries of concentrated cultivation, which has resulted in an almost universal
  deficiency of nitrogen and organic matter. The shortage of organic matter is primarily
  because farmers habitually remove crop stalks and leaves for livestock feed and
  fuel. The animal and human waste used for fertilizer contains too small an amount
  of organic matter to compensate for the loss of nutrients in the soil. The soils
  are also often deficient in phosphorus and potassium, but these deficiencies are
  neither so widespread nor so severe as that of nitrogen.At one time, half of the
  territory of present-day China may have been covered by forests, but now less than
  one-tenth of the country is forested. Extensive forests in central and southern
  China were cleared for farmlands, resulting in the inevitable erosion of soils from
  the hillsides and their deposition in the valleys. Farmers have constructed level
  terraces, supported by walls, in order to hold back water for rice fields, thus
  effectively controlling erosion. Wherever elaborate terraces have been built, soil
  erosion is virtually absent, and stepped terraces have become one of the characteristic
  features of the rural landscape.Excessive grazing and other practices that destroy
  the grass cover have also produced soil loss. When its valuable crumb structure
  is broken down and its porosity is lost, the topsoil is easily washed away through
  erosion in the rainy season; the wind produces the same effect in dry regions. The
  Loess Plateau, constantly buffeted by rain and wind, is especially vulnerable to
  soil erosion, which results in a distinctive landscape. Deep, steep-sided gullies
  cut the plateau into fantastic relief. The damage done by heavy rain in summer includes
  not only topsoil loss but also frequent flooding by silt-laden rivers.The vast and
  topographically varied landmass of China lies in Asia, the world’s largest continent,
  and faces the Pacific, the world’s largest ocean, along an extensive shoreline.
  The country’s climate is thus heavily influenced by the seasonal movement of large
  air masses between the Pacific and the Chinese mainland. The polar continental air
  mass, originating to the north in Siberia, dominates a large part of China during
  the winter; likewise, the tropical Pacific air mass exerts its influence during
  the summer. The sharply varied climatic conditions prevailing in summer and in winter
  are a direct result of the interaction of these two air masses, which are entirely
  different in nature.The Siberian air mass, which is quite stable, is extremely cold
  and dry and often has marked layers of temperature inversion. After crossing the
  Mongolian Plateau, the air mass spreads southward and begins to invade North China,
  where it undergoes a series of rapid changes; its temperature rises slightly, and
  its stability decreases. During the day the air there may be quite warm, but at
  night or in shaded places the cold is often unbearable. In general, the diurnal
  (daily) range of temperature is more than 18 °F (10 °C); in extreme cases it may
  exceed 45 °F (25 °C). Because North China is affected by this air mass most of the
  time, it is dry, with clear weather and an abundance of sunshine during the winter
  months.The prevailing winter wind blows from November through March, but it changes
  direction as it moves to the south. In northern and northeastern China its direction
  is from the northwest, in eastern China it comes from the north, and on the southeastern
  coasts it is from the northeast. The height of the winter wind belt usually does
  not exceed 13,000 feet (4,000 metres). As it moves to the south, the height decreases;
  in Nanjing it is about 6,500 feet (2,000 metres), and in South China it is less
  than 5,000 feet (1,500 metres). The Qin Mountains become an effective barrier to
  the advance of the cold waves to the south, particularly in the western section,
  where the average elevation of the mountains is mainly between 6,500 and 9,000 feet
  (2,000 and 2,700 metres).In China the tropical Pacific air mass is the chief source
  of summer rainfall. When it predominates, it may cover the eastern half of China
  and penetrate deep into the border areas of the Mongolian Plateau and onto the eastern
  edge of the Plateau of Tibet. In summer the Siberian air mass retreats to the western
  end of Mongolia, although it occasionally penetrates southward and sometimes may
  reach the Huai River valley, which constitutes a summertime battleground between
  the tropical Pacific and Siberian air masses.The movement of the two air masses
  is of immense significance to the climate of central and North China. In summer,
  when the tropical air mass predominates, the frontal zone between the two shifts
  northward; as a result, North China receives heavier rainfall. When the southeastern
  monsoon slackens, however, the frontal zone moves southward, and central China receives
  more rainfall, which can cause flooding. The activity of the tropical Pacific air
  mass in winter is confined to the southeast coastal areas; during that season, therefore,
  it frequently drizzles in the hilly areas south of the Nan Mountains, and morning
  fog is common.Besides these two air masses, three other air masses also influence
  China’s climate: the equatorial continental air mass (a highly unstable southwest
  monsoon), the polar maritime air mass, and the equatorial maritime air mass. Furthermore,
  because China is so vast and has such complex topography, the interaction between
  the air masses and relief produces a wide range of climatic conditions.Temperatures
  generally decrease from south to north. The mean annual temperature is above 68
  °F (20 °C) in the Pearl River valley. It decreases to between 59 and 68 °F (15 and
  20 °C) in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze, to about 50 °F (10 °C) in
  North China and the southern part of Xinjiang, and to 41 °F (5 °C) in the southern
  area of the Northeast, the northern part of Xinjiang, and places near the Great
  Wall. It drops below 32 °F (0 °C; i.e., freezing) in the northern part of Heilongjiang.
  The annual range of temperature between the extreme south and north is about 86
  °F (48 °C). With few exceptions, January is the coldest month and July is the hottest.South
  of the Qin Mountains–Huai River line, the mean January temperature increases progressively,
  rising from freezing to 72 °F (22 °C) on the southern coast of Hainan Island. Snow
  rarely falls, and the rivers do not freeze. North of this line, the temperature
  drops from freezing to −18 °F (−28 °C) in the northern part of Heilongjiang.In April
  the mean temperature is above freezing for the whole of China, with the exception
  of extreme northern Heilongjiang. During that time the mean temperature for the
  Northeast Plain is between 36 and 46 °F (2 and 8 °C), and for the extensive plain
  between Beijing and Shanghai it is between 54 and 59 °F (12 and 15 °C). South of
  the Nan Mountains the mean temperature is considerably higher than 68 °F (20 °C).
  Along the coast of southern Guangdong, willows start to bud in late January, but
  in Beijing the budding of willows comes as late as early April.In summer the temperature
  range between North and South China is quite small. In July the difference in temperature
  between Guangzhou and Beijing is only about 5 °F (3 °C), and the isotherms in July
  are roughly parallel to the coastline. In July the isotherm of 82 °F (28 °C) marks
  an extensive area. The hottest places in China are found along the valleys of the
  middle and lower Yangtze. The mean July temperature of Nanchang and Changsha is
  well above 84 °F (29 °C), and in many years it exceeds 86 °F (30 °C).In North China
  autumn is generally cooler than spring. The mean October temperature in Beijing
  is about 55 °F (13 °C), and in April it is about 57 °F (14 °C). In South China the
  reverse is true. The mean October temperature in Guangzhou is 75 °F (24 °C), but
  in April it is only about 70 °F (21 °C).The middle and lower reaches of the Huang
  He are where China’s civilization and agriculture first developed. There the seasonal
  rhythm is well marked, and the duration of each season is evenly spaced. In other
  parts of China, however, the duration as well as the starting and closing dates
  of each season vary among different regions. Summer is nonexistent in northern Heilongjiang,
  while there is no winter in southern Guangdong. At Kunming, in the Yunnan uplands,
  the climate is mild throughout the year, with only brief summer and winter periods.In
  general, south of the Qin Mountains–Huai River line the mean daily temperature seldom
  falls below freezing, so that farming can be practiced year-round. In the Yangtze
  valley two crops are usually grown annually, but north of the Great Wall only one
  crop per year is possible.Precipitation in China generally follows the same pattern
  as temperatures, decreasing from the southeast to the northwest. The annual total
  of certain areas along the southeastern coast amounts to more than 80 inches (2,000
  mm). The Yangtze valley receives about 40 to 45 inches (1,000 to 1,150 mm). Farther
  north, in the Huai River valley, the annual rainfall decreases to some 35 inches
  (880 mm). In the lower reaches of the Huang He, only 20 to 25 inches (500 to 650
  mm) falls annually. The Northeast generally receives more precipitation than the
  North China Plain, with upwards of 40 or more inches falling in the Changbai Mountains.The
  southeast monsoon loses much of its moisture by the time it reaches the northern
  part of the Loess Plateau, where the annual precipitation is reduced to between
  12 and 20 inches (300 and 500 mm). Northwest of a line linking the Da Hinggan (Greater
  Khingan), Yin, Lang, Qilian, and Altun ranges, the annual precipitation is less
  than 10 inches (250 mm). Because these regions are far from the sea, high mountains
  prevent the southern monsoon from reaching them, and only grasslands are found there.
  In western Inner Mongolia, the Gansu Corridor, and the Tarim Basin, the annual precipitation
  drops to 4 inches (100 mm) or less. These are areas of true desert, where sometimes
  not a single drop of moisture is received for several years.The Junggar Basin and
  the Ili River valley of northern Xinjiang are open to the influences of the westerlies,
  and precipitation is heavier there. Precipitation on the Plateau of Tibet, following
  the national pattern, decreases from southeast to northwest. More than 40 inches
  falls annually in the valleys in the southeastern part of the plateau, and the eastern
  edge receives 20 inches. However, in the enclosed Qaidam Basin in the north, the
  yearly total is only 4 to 10 inches.The high variability of precipitation is another
  characteristic of China’s climate. Usually, variability increases as annual amounts
  decrease, a circumstance that is closely connected with the country’s high frequency
  of drought and flood. Spring rain is of immense significance to Chinese farmers,
  but spring is also the season with the highest variability. In South China the variability
  exceeds 40 percent, along the Yangtze it is about 45 percent, and in North China
  it is more than 50 percent. The variability of a vast area in North China exceeds
  70 percent in some places; east of Beijing, for example, the rainfall variability
  in spring may even exceed 80 percent, as it also does in the central parts of the
  Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau.Rain falls mostly in the summer months, when plants need
  water the most. This is an important asset for farmers, but summer rainfall is usually
  too intense. In July, when the frontal zone shifts northward, cyclones (circulation
  of winds around centres of low atmospheric pressure) are much more active in North
  China than in South China, and North China begins to receive heavier rainfall. More
  than half the area of the North China Plain records 0.8 inch (20 mm) of rainfall
  daily, and in some places it may reach as much as 1 inch (25 mm) or more daily.
  During that time, areas south of the Yangtze are covered by the tropical Pacific
  air mass, so that the weather becomes comparatively stable, the amount of rainfall
  usually decreases, and the average rainfall intensity is less than that of June.
  The intensity of August rainfall is in general less than that of July.In the southeastern
  coastal regions, around Fuzhou and Shantou, the maximum daily rainfall may even
  approach 12 inches (300 mm). Such accumulations are directly related to the high
  frequency of typhoons (tropical cyclones) striking that part of the coast, usually
  during the period from May to November; July, August, and September are the three
  months when typhoons are the most frequent.In May, typhoons usually strike the coast
  south of Shantou. Later in June they shift northward, arriving between Shantou and
  Wenzhou, and after July they invade areas north of Wenzhou. August has the highest
  frequency of typhoon invasions, when more than one-third of the typhoons reaching
  China arrive. After September the frequency of typhoons decreases, and the pattern
  again shifts southward. In October, typhoons usually land south of Wenzhou; the
  late typhoons arriving in November and December strike south of Shantou.bambooJoan
  Lebold Cohen/Photo ResearchersChina’s great topological and climatic diversity has
  produced a vast array of natural vegetation types. The country’s total number of
  seed-plant species is approximately 30,000, representing some 2,700 genera; more
  than 200 of these genera are endemic to China. There are about 2,500 species of
  forest trees, including some 95 percent of the known broad-leaved types. Many of
  these trees are of economic importance, such as tung trees, camphor trees, varnish
  trees (Rhus verniciflua), star anise (which yields an oil used as a flavouring additive),
  and glossy privet (Ligustrum lucidum).Contributing to the variety and intermixture
  of tropical and temperate plants in China are such factors as the lack of insurmountable
  topographic barriers, such as large stretches of desert, between the tropical, temperate,
  and subalpine zones; wind systems that alternate in winter and summer; and the frequent
  occurrence of cyclones. If, for example, the vegetation of Heilongjiang province
  in the North and of Guangdong province in the South are compared, it is hardly possible
  to find a single common plant species, with the exception of certain weeds. In the
  taiga (boreal forest) zone of China’s northern border region or in the high mountains,
  on the other hand, there are many plant species that are also found in the lands
  within the Arctic Circle, while in the Chinese tropics there are species that also
  grow south of the Equator. However, from the ecological point of view, the tropical
  forests of South China generally do not differ greatly from those of Indonesia and
  other Southeast Asian countries, and the desert and steppe vegetation of northwestern
  China is closely akin to that found in Mongolia or Kazakhstan. Furthermore, the
  Chinese taiga terrain of the frontier area adjoining Russia is essentially the same
  as that of Siberia.A traveler in China may encounter practically all types of natural
  vegetation indigenous to the Northern Hemisphere, the exception being species of
  the polar tundra. There are mangrove swamps along the shores of the South China
  Sea; rainforests on Hainan Island and in southern Yunnan; and deserts, steppes,
  meadows, and savannas elsewhere, as well as regions where tropical and temperate
  coniferous and evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved plants prevail.China may be
  divided—roughly along a diagonal from the southwest to the northeast—into two sharply
  different vegetation zones: the dry northwest and the humid southeast. The tropical
  area, adjoining the humid southeast, is geographically related more to Southeast
  Asia. In the northwest, where desertlike conditions prevail, are vast areas of sparse
  drought-resistant vegetation; within these areas, in the low-lying land and depressions,
  are patches of salt-tolerant plants, notably in the Junngar, Qaidam, and Gobi regions.
  Skirting the southern edge of the Gobi is a wide belt of grassland.The profusion
  of vegetation types and a variety of relief have allowed a great diversity of animal
  life to develop and have permitted animals to survive there that elsewhere are extinct.
  Notable among such survivals are the great paddlefish of the Yangtze, the species
  of small alligator in eastern and central China, and the giant salamander (related
  to the Japanese giant salamander and the American hellbender) in western China.
  The diversity of animal life is perhaps greatest in the ranges and valleys of Tibet
  and Sichuan, the latter province being renowned as the home of the giant panda.
  The takin (a type of goat antelope), numerous species of pheasants, and a variety
  of laughing thrushes are found in all Chinese mountain ranges. China seems to be
  one of the chief centres of dispersal of the carp family and also of old-world catfishes.The
  regional affinities of Chinese animal life are complex. Resemblances in the Northeast
  are to the fauna of the Siberian forests. Animals from Central Asia inhabit suitable
  steppe areas in northern China. The life of the great mountain ranges is Palearctic
  (relating to a biogeographic region that includes Europe, Asia north of the Himalayas,
  northern Arabia, and Africa north of the Sahara) but with distinctively Chinese
  species or genera. To the southeast the lowlands and mountains alike permit direct
  access to the eastern region. This part of China presents a complete transition
  from temperate-zone Palearctic life to the wealth of tropical forms distinctive
  of southeastern Asia. Tropical types of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals
  predominate in the southernmost Chinese provinces.1Statutory number; includes 36

  Jen-min Kung-ho-kuo, \n    country of East Asia. It is the largest of all Asian
  countries and has the largest population of any country in the world. Occupying
  nearly the entire East Asian landmass, it occupies approximately one-fourteenth
  of the land area of Earth. Among the major countries of the world, China is surpassed
  in area by only Russia and Canada, and it is almost as large as the whole of Europe.Shanghai:
  financial district© Jeremy Woodhouse/Getty ImagesChina has 33 administrative units
  directly under the central government; these consist of 22 provinces, 5 autonomous
  regions, 4 municipalities (Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin), and 2 special
  administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau). The island province of Taiwan, which
  has been under separate administration since 1949, is discussed in the article Taiwan.
  Beijing (Peking), the capital of the People’s Republic, is also the cultural, economic,
  and communications centre of the country. Shanghai is the main industrial city;
  Hong Kong is the leading commercial centre and port.Within China’s boundaries exists
  a highly diverse and complex country. Its topography encompasses the highest and
  one of the lowest places on Earth, and its relief varies from nearly impenetrable
  mountainous terrain to vast coastal lowlands. Its climate ranges from extremely
  dry, desertlike conditions in the northwest to tropical monsoon in the southeast,
  and China has the greatest contrast in temperature between its northern and southern
  borders of any country in the world.The diversity of both China’s relief and its
  climate has resulted in one of the world’s widest arrays of ecological niches, and
  these niches have been filled by a vast number of plant and animal species. Indeed,
  practically all types of Northern Hemisphere plants, except those of the polar tundra,
  are found in China, and, despite the continuous inroads of humans over the millennia,
  China still is home to some of the world’s most exotic animals.Probably the single
  most identifiable characteristic of China to the people of the rest of the world
  is the size of its population. Some one-fifth of humanity is of Chinese nationality.
  The great majority of the population is Chinese (Han), and thus China is often characterized
  as an ethnically homogeneous country, but few countries have as wide a variety of
  indigenous peoples as does China. Even among the Han there are cultural and linguistic
  differences between regions; for example, the only point of linguistic commonality
  between two individuals from different parts of China may be the written Chinese
  language. Because China’s population is so enormous, the population density of the
  country is also often thought to be uniformly high, but vast areas of China are
  either uninhabited or sparsely populated.Great Wall of ChinaContunico © ZDF Enterprises
  GmbH, MainzWith more than 4,000 years of recorded history, China is one of the few
  existing countries that also flourished economically and culturally in the earliest
  stages of world civilization. Indeed, despite the political and social upheavals
  that frequently have ravaged the country, China is unique among nations in its longevity
  and resilience as a discrete politico-cultural unit. Much of China’s cultural development
  has been accomplished with relatively little outside influence, the introduction
  of Buddhism from India constituting a major exception. Even when the country was
  penetrated by such “barbarian” peoples as the Manchu, these groups soon became largely
  absorbed into the fabric of Han Chinese culture.This relative isolation from the
  outside world made possible over the centuries the flowering and refinement of the
  Chinese culture, but it also left China ill prepared to cope with that world when,
  from the mid-19th century, it was confronted by technologically superior foreign
  nations. There followed a century of decline and decrepitude, as China found itself
  relatively helpless in the face of a foreign onslaught. The trauma of this external
  challenge became the catalyst for a revolution that began in the early 20th century
  against the old regime and culminated in the establishment of a communist government
  in 1949. This event reshaped global political geography, and China has since come
  to rank among the most influential countries in the world.Central to China’s long-enduring
  identity as a unitary country is the province, or sheng (“secretariat”). The provinces
  are traceable in their current form to the Tang dynasty (ad 618–907). Over the centuries,
  provinces gained in importance as centres of political and economic authority and
  increasingly became the focus of regional identification and loyalty. Provincial
  power reached its peak in the first two decades of the 20th century, but, since
  the establishment of the People’s Republic, that power has been curtailed by a strong
  central leadership in Beijing. Nonetheless, while the Chinese state has remained
  unitary in form, the vast size and population of China’s provinces—which are comparable
  to large and midsize nations—dictate their continuing importance as a level of subnational
  administration.LandChinaChina stretches for about 3,250 miles (5,250 km) from east
  to west and 3,400 miles (5,500 km) from north to south. Its land frontier is about
  12,400 miles (20,000 km) in length, and its coastline extends for some 8,700 miles
  (14,000 km). The country is bounded by Mongolia to the north; Russia and North Korea
  to the northeast; the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea to the east; the South China
  Sea to the southeast; Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar (Burma), India, Bhutan, and Nepal to
  the south; Pakistan to the southwest; and Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and
  Kazakhstan to the west. In addition to the 14 countries that border directly on
  it, China also faces South Korea and Japan, across the Yellow Sea, and the Philippines,
  which lie beyond the South China Sea.ReliefKyrgyz: mosqueDugald Bremner/StoneBroadly
  speaking, the relief of China is high in the west and low in the east; consequently,
  the direction of flow of the major rivers is generally eastward. The surface may
  be divided into three steps, or levels. The first level is represented by the Plateau
  of Tibet, which is located in both the Tibet Autonomous Region and the province
  of Qinghai and which, with an average elevation of well over 13,000 feet (4,000
  metres) above sea level, is the loftiest highland area in the world. The western
  part of this region, the Qiangtang, has an average height of 16,500 feet (5,000
  metres) and is known as the “roof of the world.”The second step lies to the north
  of the Kunlun and Qilian mountains and (farther south) to the east of the Qionglai
  and Daliang ranges. There the mountains descend sharply to heights of between 6,000
  and 3,000 feet (1,800 and 900 metres), after which basins intermingle with plateaus.
  This step includes the Mongolian Plateau, the Tarim Basin, the Loess Plateau (loess
  is a yellow-gray dust deposited by the wind), the Sichuan Basin, and the Yunnan-Guizhou
  (Yungui) Plateau.The third step extends from the east of the Dalou, Taihang, and
  Wu mountain ranges and from the eastern perimeter of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau
  to the China Sea. Almost all of this area is made up of hills and plains lying below
  1,500 feet (450 metres).The most remarkable feature of China’s relief is the vast
  extent of its mountain chains; the mountains, indeed, have exerted a tremendous
  influence on the country’s political, economic, and cultural development. By rough
  estimate, about one-third of the total area of China consists of mountains. China
  has the world’s tallest mountain and the world’s highest and largest plateau, in
  addition to possessing extensive coastal plains. The five major landforms—mountain,
  plateau, hill, plain, and basin—are all well represented. China’s complex natural
  environment and rich natural resources are closely connected with the varied nature
  of its relief.The topography of China is marked by many splendours. Mount Everest
  (Qomolangma Feng), situated on the border between China and Nepal, is the highest
  peak in the world, at an elevation of 29,035 feet (8,850 metres; see Researcher’s
  Note: Height of Mount Everest). By contrast, the lowest part of the Turfan Depression
  in the Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang—Lake Ayding—is 508 feet (155 metres)
  below sea level. The coast of China contrasts greatly between South and North. To
  the south of the bay of Hangzhou, the coast is rocky and indented with many harbours
  and offshore islands. To the north, except along the Shandong and Liaodong peninsulas,
  the coast is sandy and flat.China is prone to intense seismic activity throughout
  much of the country. The main source of this geologic instability is the result
  of the constant northward movement of the Indian tectonic plate beneath southern
  Asia, which has thrust up the towering mountains and high plateaus of the Chinese
  southwest. Throughout its history China has experienced hundreds of massive earthquakes
  that collectively have killed millions of people. Two in the 20th century alone—in
  eastern Gansu province (1920) and in the city of Tangshan, eastern Hebei province
  (1976)—caused some 250,000 deaths each, and a quake in east-central Sichuan province
  in 2008 killed tens of thousands and devastated a wide area.China’s physical relief
  has dictated its development in many respects. The civilization of Han Chinese originated
  in the southern part of the Loess Plateau, and from there it extended outward until
  it encountered the combined barriers of relief and climate. The long, protruding
  corridor, commonly known as the Gansu, or Hexi, Corridor, illustrates this fact.
  South of the corridor is the Plateau of Tibet, which was too high and too cold for
  the Chinese to gain a foothold. North of the corridor is the Gobi Desert, which
  also formed a barrier. Consequently, Chinese civilization was forced to spread along
  the corridor, where melting snow and ice in the Qilian Mountains provided water
  for oasis farming. The westward extremities of the corridor became the meeting place
  of the ancient East and West.Thus, for a long time the ancient political centre
  of China was located along the lower reaches of the Huang He (Yellow River). Because
  of topographical barriers, however, it was difficult for the central government
  to gain complete control over the entire country, except when an unusually strong
  dynasty was in power. In many instances the Sichuan Basin—an isolated region in
  southwestern China, about twice the size of Scotland, that is well protected by
  high mountains and is self-sufficient in agricultural products—became an independent
  kingdom. A comparable situation often arose in the Tarim Basin in the northwest.
  Linked to the rest of China only by the Gansu Corridor, this basin is even remoter
  than the Sichuan, and, when the central government was unable to exert its influence,
  oasis states were established; only the three strong dynasties—the Han (206 bc–ad
  220), the Tang (ad 618–907), and the Qing, or Manchu (1644–1911/12)—were capable
  of controlling the region.Apart from the three elevation zones already mentioned,
  it is possible—on the basis of geologic structure, climatic conditions, and differences
  in geomorphologic development—to divide China into three major topographic regions:
  the eastern, northwestern, and southwestern zones. The eastern zone is shaped by
  the rivers, which have eroded landforms in some parts and have deposited alluvial
  plains in others; its climate is monsoonal (characterized by seasonal rain-bearing
  winds). The northwestern region is arid and eroded by the wind; it forms an inland
  drainage basin. The southwest is a cold, lofty, and mountainous region containing
  intermontane plateaus and inland lakes.The three basic regions may be further subdivided
  into second-order geographic divisions. The eastern region contains 10 of these,
  the southwest contains two, and the northwest contains three. Below is a brief description
  of each division.The eastern regionThe Northeast PlainDa Hinggan RangeRichard Harrington/ComstockThe
  Northeast Plain (also known as the Manchurian Plain and the Sung-liao Plain) is
  located in China’s Northeast, the region formerly known as Manchuria. It is bordered
  to the west and north by the Da Hinggan (Greater Khingan) Range and to the east
  by the Xiao Hinggan (Lesser Khingan) Range. An undulating plain split into northern
  and southern halves by a low divide rising from 500 to 850 feet (150 to 260 metres),
  it is drained in its northern part by the Sungari River and tributaries and in its
  southern part by the Liao River. Most of the area has an erosional rather than a
  depositional surface, but it is covered with a deep soil. The plain has an area
  of about 135,000 square miles (350,000 square km). Its basic landscapes are forest-steppe,
  steppe, meadow-steppe, and cultivated land; its soils are rich and black, and it
  is a famous agricultural region. The river valleys are wide and flat with a series
  of terraces formed by deposits of silt. During the flood season the rivers inundate
  extensive areas.The Changbai MountainsTo the southeast of the Northeast Plain is
  a series of ranges comprising the Changbai, Zhangguangcai, and Wanda mountains,
  which in Chinese are collectively known as the Changbai Shan, or “Forever White
  Mountains”; broken by occasional open valleys, they reach elevations mostly between
  1,500 and 3,000 feet (450 and 900 metres). In some parts the scenery is characterized
  by rugged peaks and precipitous cliffs. The highest peak is the volcanic cone of
  Mount Baitou (9,003 feet [2,744 metres]), which has a beautiful crater lake at its
  snow-covered summit. As one of the major forest areas of China, the region is the
  source of many valuable furs and famous medicinal herbs. Cultivation is generally
  limited to the valley floors.The North China PlainComparable in size to the Northeast
  Plain, most of the North China Plain lies at elevations below 160 feet (50 metres),
  and the relief is monotonously flat. It was formed by enormous sedimentary deposits
  brought down by the Huang He and Huai River from the Loess Plateau; the Quaternary
  deposits alone (i.e., those from the past 2.6 million years) reach thicknesses of
  2,500 to 3,000 feet (760 to 900 metres). The river channels, which are higher than
  the surrounding locality, form local water divides, and the areas between the channels
  are depressions in which lakes and swamps are found. In particularly low and flat
  areas, the underground water table often fluctuates from 5 to 6.5 feet (1.5 to 2
  metres), forming meadow swamps and, in some places, resulting in saline soils. A
  densely populated area that has long been under settlement, the North China Plain
  has the highest proportion of land under cultivation of any region in China.The
  Loess PlateauYan RiverA.Topping—Rapho/Photo ResearchersThis vast plateau of some
  154,000 square miles (400,000 square km) forms a unique region of loess-clad hills
  and barren mountains between the North China Plain and the deserts of the west.
  In the north the Great Wall of China forms the boundary, while the southern limit
  is the Qin Mountains in Shaanxi province. The average surface elevation is roughly
  4,000 feet (1,200 metres), but individual ranges of bedrock are higher, reaching
  9,825 feet (2,995 metres) in the Liupan Mountains. Most of the plateau is covered
  with loess to thicknesses of 165 to 260 feet (50 to 80 metres). In northern Shaanxi
  and eastern Gansu provinces, the loess may reach much greater thicknesses. The loess
  is particularly susceptible to erosion by water, and ravines and gorges crisscross
  the plateau. It has been estimated that ravines cover approximately half the entire
  region, with erosion reaching depths of 300 to 650 feet (90 to 200 metres).The Shandong
  HillsThese hills are basically composed of extremely ancient crystalline shales
  and granites of early Precambrian age (i.e., older than about 2.5 billion years)
  and of somewhat younger sedimentary rocks dating to about 540–420 million years
  ago. Faults have played a major role in creating the present relief, and, as a result,
  many hills are horsts (blocks of the Earth’s crust uplifted along faults), while
  the valleys have been formed by grabens (blocks of the Earth’s crust that have been
  thrust down along faults). The Jiaolai Plain divides this region into two parts.
  The eastern part is lower, lying at elevations averaging below 1,500 feet (450 metres),
  with only certain peaks and ridges rising to 2,500 feet and (rarely) to 3,000 feet
  (900 metres); the highest point, Mount Lao, reaches 3,714 feet (1,132 metres). The
  western part is slightly higher, rising to 5,000 feet (1,524 metres) at Mount Tai,
  one of China’s most sacred mountains. The Shandong Hills meet the sea along a rocky
  and indented shoreline.The Qin MountainsThe Qin (conventional Tsinling) Mountains
  in Shaanxi province are the greatest chain of mountains east of the Plateau of Tibet.
  The mountain chain consists of a high and rugged barrier extending from Gansu to
  Henan; geographers use a line between the chain and the Huai River to divide China
  proper into two parts—North and South. The elevation of the mountains varies from
  3,000 to 10,000 feet (900 to 3,000 metres). The western part is higher, with the
  highest peak, Mount Taibai, rising to 12,359 feet (3,767 metres). The Qin Mountains
  consist of a series of parallel ridges, all running roughly west-east, separated
  by a maze of ramifying valleys whose canyon walls often rise sheer to a height of
  1,000 feet (300 metres) above the valley streams.The Sichuan BasinThis is one of
  the most attractive geographical regions of China. The Sichuan Basin is surrounded
  by mountains, which are higher in the west and north. Protected against the penetration
  of cold northern winds, the basin is much warmer in the winter than are the more
  southerly plains of southeast China. Except for the Chengdu Plain, the region is
  hilly. The relief of the basin’s eastern half consists of numerous folds, forming
  a series of ridges and valleys that trend northeast to southwest. The lack of arable
  land has obliged farmers to cultivate the slopes of the hills, on which they have
  built terraces that frequently cover the slopes from top to bottom. The terracing
  has slowed down the process of erosion and has made it possible to cultivate additional
  areas by using the steeper slopes—some of which have grades up to 45° or more.The
  southeastern mountainsSoutheastern China is bordered by a rocky shoreline backed
  by picturesque mountains. In general, there is a distinct structural and topographic
  trend from northeast to southwest. The higher peaks may reach elevations of some
  5,000 to 6,500 feet (1,500 to 2,000 metres). The rivers are short and fast-flowing
  and have cut steep-sided valleys. The chief areas of settlement are on narrow strips
  of coastal plain where rice is produced. Along the coast there are numerous islands,
  where the fishing industry is well developed.Plains of the middle and lower YangtzeEast
  of Yichang, in Hubei province, a series of plains of uneven width are found along
  the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang). The plains are particularly wide in the delta area
  and in places where the Yangtze receives its major tributaries—including large areas
  of lowlands around Dongting, Poyang, Tai, and Hongze lakes, which are all hydrologically
  linked with the Yangtze. The region is an alluvial plain, the accumulation of sediment
  laid down by the rivers throughout long ages. There are a few isolated hills, but
  in general the land is level, lying mostly below 160 feet (50 metres). Rivers, canals,
  and lakes form a dense network of waterways. The surface of the plain has been converted
  into a system of flat terraces, which descend in steps along the slopes of the valleys.The
  Nan MountainsThe Nan Mountains (Nan Ling) are composed of many ranges of mountains
  running from northeast to southwest. These ranges form the watershed between the
  Yangtze to the north and the Pearl (Zhu) River to the south. The main peaks along
  the watershed are above 5,000 feet, and some are more than 6,500 feet. But a large
  part of the land to the south of the Nan Mountains is also hilly; flatland does
  not exceed 10 percent of the total area. The Pearl River Delta is the only extensive
  plain in this region and is also the richest part of South China. The coastline
  is rugged and irregular, and there are many promontories and protected bays, including
  those of Hong Kong and Macau. The principal river is the Xi River, which rises in
  the highlands of eastern Yunnan and southern Guizhou.The southwestThe Yunnan-Guizhou
  PlateauThis region comprises the northern part of Yunnan and the western part of
  Guizhou; its edge is highly dissected. Yunnan is more distinctly a plateau and contains
  larger areas of rolling uplands than Guizhou, but both parts are distinguished by
  canyonlike valleys and precipitous mountains. The highest elevations lie in the
  west, where Mount Diancang (also called Cang Shan) rises to 13,524 feet (4,122 metres).
  In the valleys of the major rivers, elevations drop to about 1,300 to 1,600 feet
  (400 to 490 metres). Particularly sharp differences in elevation and the greatest
  ruggedness of relief occur in the western part of the region, in the gorges of the
  large rivers. In the eastern part, karst processes (creating sinks, ravines, and
  underground streams in the limestone landscape) have developed very strongly. Scattered
  throughout the highlands are small lake basins, separated by mountains.The Plateau
  of TibetBrahmaputra River: stupa© Naomi Duguid/Asia AccessThis great upland massif
  occupies about one-fourth of the country’s area. A large part of the plateau lies
  at elevations above 13,000 to 16,500 feet (4,000 to 5,000 metres). The border ranges
  of the plateau (the Kunlun Mountains and the Himalayas) are even higher, with individual
  peaks rising to heights of 23,000 to 26,000 feet (7,000 to 8,000 metres) and higher.
  As a rule, the interior (i.e., Tibet-side) slopes of these border mountains are
  gentle, while the exterior slopes are precipitous. The plateau’s eastern and southern
  periphery is the source of many of the world’s great rivers, including the Yangtze,
  Huang He, Mekong, Salween, Indus, and Brahmaputra. Only in the low valleys, chiefly
  along the Brahmaputra valley, are there centres of human settlement.The Qaidam (Tsaidam)
  Basin, occupying the northwestern portion of the Plateau of Tibet, is the largest,
  as well as the lowest, depression in the plateau. The broad northwestern part of
  the basin lies at elevations between approximately 8,800 and 10,000 feet (2,700
  and 3,000 metres), and the narrow southeastern part is slightly lower. Gravel, sandy
  and clay deserts, semideserts, and salt wastes predominate within the basin.The
  northwestThe Tarim BasinKunlun Mountains© Jeffrey Alford/Asia AccessNorth of the
  Plateau of Tibet and at the much lower elevation of about 3,000 feet (900 metres)
  lies the Tarim Basin. It is hemmed in by great mountain ranges: the Tien Shan (Tian
  Shan; “Celestial Mountains”) on the north, the Pamirs on the west, and the Kunlun
  Mountains on the south. Glacier-fed streams descend from these heights only to lose
  themselves in the loose sands and gravels of the Takla Makan Desert, which occupies
  the centre of the basin. The Takla Makan is one of the most barren of the world’s
  deserts; only a few of the largest rivers—such as the Tarim and Hotan (Khotan)—cross
  the desert, but even their flow is not constant, and they have water throughout
  their entire courses only during the flood period. The area of the basin is about
  215,000 square miles (557,000 square km), and its elevations range from 2,500 to
  4,600 feet (750 to 1,400 metres) above sea level. Its surface slants to the southeast,
  where Lop Nur (a salt-encrusted lake bed) is situated.The Junggar BasinNorth of
  the Tarim Basin is another large depression, the Junggar (Dzungarian) Basin. It
  is enclosed by the Tien Shan on the south, while to the northeast it is cut off
  from Mongolia by the Altai Mountains. The surface of the basin is flat, with a gentle
  slope to the southwest. The larger portion of the land lies at elevations between
  about 1,000 and 1,500 feet (300 and 450 metres), and in the lowest part the elevation
  drops to just below 650 feet (200 metres). In general the main part of the basin
  is covered by a broad desert with barchans (crescent-shaped sand dunes that move);
  only in certain parts are dunes retained by vegetation.The Tien ShanBogda MountainsK.
  Scholz/Shostal AssociatesThe Chinese (eastern) part of the Tien Shan consists of
  a complex system of ranges and depressions divided into two major groups of ranges:
  the northern and the southern. The groups are separated by a strip of intermontane
  depressions that itself is broken up by the interior ranges. Ancient metamorphic
  rock constitutes the larger portion of the ranges in the interior zone; Paleozoic
  (i.e., about 250 to 540 million years old) sedimentary and igneous sedimentary beds
  form its northern and southern chains, while Mesozoic (about 65 to 250 million years
  old) sandstones and conglomerates fill the intermontane depressions in the interior
  zone and constitute the foothill ridges. The height of the main Chinese chains of
  the Tien Shan is between 13,000 and 15,000 feet (4,000 and 4,600 metres), with individual
  peaks exceeding 16,000 feet (4,900 metres); the interior chains reach 14,500 feet
  (4,400 metres). In the western part, where precipitation is adequate, large glaciers
  are formed, reaching a length of more than 20 miles (32 km). Large rivers with heavy
  flows, such as the Ili (Yili) River and its tributaries, begin their courses there,
  and the predominantly alpine meadow steppe is one of the best grazing lands of China.DrainageHuang
  He: junks on the Huang HeTim Megarry/Robert Harding Picture LibraryChina has more
  than 50,000 rivers with individual drainage areas exceeding 40 square miles (100
  square km). Of the total annual runoff, about 95 percent drains directly into the
  sea (more than 80 percent into the Pacific Ocean, 12 percent into the Indian Ocean,
  and less than 1 percent into the Arctic Ocean) and 5 percent disappears inland.The
  three principal rivers of China, all of which flow generally from west to east,
  draining into the China Sea, are the Huang He, the Yangtze, and the Xi. The Huang
  He, which rises in the Kunlun Mountains, is the northernmost of the three; it drains
  into the Bo Hai (Gulf of Chihli), north of the Shandong Peninsula. The Yangtze,
  the longest river in the country, rises in the Tibetan Highlands and flows across
  central China, draining into the East China Sea north of Shanghai. The Xi River,
  the southernmost of the three, rises in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and empties into
  the South China Sea via the Pearl River Delta at Guangzhou (Canton).The distribution
  of surface water in China is extremely uneven. Only a small part of the country
  has sufficient quantities year-round. Much of the country has abundant runoff but
  only during the rainy summer, when enormous surpluses of water are received. From
  the southeast to the northwest, the surface water decreases as the relief becomes
  more mountainous. A vast area of the northwest lacks water throughout the year.
  North China (north of the Qin Mountains–Huai River line), with its flat relief and
  long history of agriculture, contains almost two-thirds of China’s cultivated land;
  paradoxically, because of scanty and erratic precipitation, the average annual runoff
  in the North accounts for only about one-sixth of the total for the country as a
  whole.The mountains of the southeast and the mountainous Hainan Island have the
  most abundant surface water. Over the year they receive more than 60 inches (1,500
  mm) of precipitation (in some places even more than 80 inches [2,000 mm]), of which
  almost two-thirds constitutes the runoff, so that a dense drainage network has developed.
  The amount of runoff is highest in the southeast, exceeding 40 inches (1,000 mm).
  It gradually diminishes toward the west and north, so that in the true deserts of
  the northwest it is usually less than 0.4 of an inch (10 mm). The arid climate of
  the northwest is reflected in the landscape of the dry steppes, which is characterized
  by richer grasses in the east, while in the west the landscape gradually changes
  to bare deserts.In the lower reaches of the Yangtze, the Pearl River Delta, and
  the Chengdu Plain a dense network of waterways has been developed. In the North
  China Plain and the Northeast Plain most of the rivers have a linear flow, and tributaries
  are few and unconnected. In the inland drainage area there are very few rivers because
  of scanty precipitation. Extensive areas such as the Tarim Basin and northeastern
  Gansu province are often completely devoid of runoff. In those regions the rivers
  depend on melted snow and ice; in consequence, they are mostly small and are found
  only in mountains and mountain foothills. As they drain increasingly farther away
  from the mountains, most of them eventually disappear in the desert, while some
  form inland lakes. Because the northern part of the Plateau of Tibet is a cold desert,
  the rate of evaporation is slow, so that a denser network of rivers has developed;
  most of these, however, run into glaciated depressions, forming numerous lakes.SoilsChina,
  with its vast and diverse climatic conditions, has a wide variety of soils. Indeed,
  all the soil types of the Eurasian continent, except the soils of the tundra and
  the highly leached podzolic-gley soils of the northern taiga (boreal forest), are
  found in China. As a result of the climatic differences between the drier and cooler
  North and the wetter and hotter South, soils may be grouped into two classifications.
  Generally speaking, the soils north of the Qin Mountains–Huai River line are pedocals
  (calcareous) and are neutral to alkaline in reaction; those south of this line are
  pedalfers (leached noncalcareous soils), which are neutral to acid.Apart from the
  great plateaus and high mountains to the southwest, marked soil zones are formed
  in China according to differences in climate, vegetation, and distance from the
  sea. The east and southeast coastal region is covered by the forest zone associated
  with a humid and semihumid climate, while the north and northwest inland regions
  belong mostly to the steppe zone, as well as to the semidesert and desert zone associated
  with a semiarid and arid climate. Between these two broad soil zones lies a transitional
  zone—the forest-steppe zone, where forest soils merge gradually with steppe soils.Between
  the pedocals of the North and the pedalfers of the South lie the neutral soils.
  The floodplain of the Yangtze below the Three Gorges (the point where the river
  cuts through the Wu Mountains to empty onto the Hubei Plain) is overlain with a
  thick cover of noncalcareous alluvium. These soils, sometimes classified as paddy
  (rice-growing) soils, for the most part are exceedingly fertile and of good texture.
  The paddy soil is a unique type of cultivated soil, formed over a long period of
  time under the specific conditions of intensive rice cultivation.Along the coast
  of North China are belts of saline and alkaline soil. They are associated with a
  combination of poor drainage and aridity, where precipitation is insufficient either
  to dissolve or to carry away the salts in solution.The adverse effects of nature
  on the soil have been further intensified by centuries of concentrated cultivation,
  which has resulted in an almost universal deficiency of nitrogen and organic matter.
  The shortage of organic matter is primarily because farmers habitually remove crop
  stalks and leaves for livestock feed and fuel. The animal and human waste used for
  fertilizer contains too small an amount of organic matter to compensate for the
  loss of nutrients in the soil. The soils are also often deficient in phosphorus
  and potassium, but these deficiencies are neither so widespread nor so severe as
  that of nitrogen.At one time, half of the territory of present-day China may have
  been covered by forests, but now less than one-tenth of the country is forested.
  Extensive forests in central and southern China were cleared for farmlands, resulting
  in the inevitable erosion of soils from the hillsides and their deposition in the
  valleys. Farmers have constructed level terraces, supported by walls, in order to
  hold back water for rice fields, thus effectively controlling erosion. Wherever
  elaborate terraces have been built, soil erosion is virtually absent, and stepped
  terraces have become one of the characteristic features of the rural landscape.Excessive
  grazing and other practices that destroy the grass cover have also produced soil
  loss. When its valuable crumb structure is broken down and its porosity is lost,
  the topsoil is easily washed away through erosion in the rainy season; the wind
  produces the same effect in dry regions. The Loess Plateau, constantly buffeted
  by rain and wind, is especially vulnerable to soil erosion, which results in a distinctive
  landscape. Deep, steep-sided gullies cut the plateau into fantastic relief. The
  damage done by heavy rain in summer includes not only topsoil loss but also frequent
  flooding by silt-laden rivers.ClimateThe air massesThe vast and topographically
  varied landmass of China lies in Asia, the world’s largest continent, and faces
  the Pacific, the world’s largest ocean, along an extensive shoreline. The country’s
  climate is thus heavily influenced by the seasonal movement of large air masses
  between the Pacific and the Chinese mainland. The polar continental air mass, originating
  to the north in Siberia, dominates a large part of China during the winter; likewise,
  the tropical Pacific air mass exerts its influence during the summer. The sharply
  varied climatic conditions prevailing in summer and in winter are a direct result
  of the interaction of these two air masses, which are entirely different in nature.The
  Siberian air mass, which is quite stable, is extremely cold and dry and often has
  marked layers of temperature inversion. After crossing the Mongolian Plateau, the
  air mass spreads southward and begins to invade North China, where it undergoes
  a series of rapid changes; its temperature rises slightly, and its stability decreases.
  During the day the air there may be quite warm, but at night or in shaded places
  the cold is often unbearable. In general, the diurnal (daily) range of temperature
  is more than 18 °F (10 °C); in extreme cases it may exceed 45 °F (25 °C). Because
  North China is affected by this air mass most of the time, it is dry, with clear
  weather and an abundance of sunshine during the winter months.The prevailing winter
  wind blows from November through March, but it changes direction as it moves to
  the south. In northern and northeastern China its direction is from the northwest,
  in eastern China it comes from the north, and on the southeastern coasts it is from
  the northeast. The height of the winter wind belt usually does not exceed 13,000
  feet (4,000 metres). As it moves to the south, the height decreases; in Nanjing
  it is about 6,500 feet (2,000 metres), and in South China it is less than 5,000
  feet (1,500 metres). The Qin Mountains become an effective barrier to the advance
  of the cold waves to the south, particularly in the western section, where the average
  elevation of the mountains is mainly between 6,500 and 9,000 feet (2,000 and 2,700
  metres).In China the tropical Pacific air mass is the chief source of summer rainfall.
  When it predominates, it may cover the eastern half of China and penetrate deep
  into the border areas of the Mongolian Plateau and onto the eastern edge of the
  Plateau of Tibet. In summer the Siberian air mass retreats to the western end of
  Mongolia, although it occasionally penetrates southward and sometimes may reach
  the Huai River valley, which constitutes a summertime battleground between the tropical
  Pacific and Siberian air masses.The movement of the two air masses is of immense
  significance to the climate of central and North China. In summer, when the tropical
  air mass predominates, the frontal zone between the two shifts northward; as a result,
  North China receives heavier rainfall. When the southeastern monsoon slackens, however,
  the frontal zone moves southward, and central China receives more rainfall, which
  can cause flooding. The activity of the tropical Pacific air mass in winter is confined
  to the southeast coastal areas; during that season, therefore, it frequently drizzles
  in the hilly areas south of the Nan Mountains, and morning fog is common.Besides
  these two air masses, three other air masses also influence China’s climate: the
  equatorial continental air mass (a highly unstable southwest monsoon), the polar
  maritime air mass, and the equatorial maritime air mass. Furthermore, because China
  is so vast and has such complex topography, the interaction between the air masses
  and relief produces a wide range of climatic conditions.TemperatureTemperatures
  generally decrease from south to north. The mean annual temperature is above 68
  °F (20 °C) in the Pearl River valley. It decreases to between 59 and 68 °F (15 and
  20 °C) in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze, to about 50 °F (10 °C) in
  North China and the southern part of Xinjiang, and to 41 °F (5 °C) in the southern
  area of the Northeast, the northern part of Xinjiang, and places near the Great
  Wall. It drops below 32 °F (0 °C; i.e., freezing) in the northern part of Heilongjiang.
  The annual range of temperature between the extreme south and north is about 86
  °F (48 °C). With few exceptions, January is the coldest month and July is the hottest.South
  of the Qin Mountains–Huai River line, the mean January temperature increases progressively,
  rising from freezing to 72 °F (22 °C) on the southern coast of Hainan Island. Snow
  rarely falls, and the rivers do not freeze. North of this line, the temperature
  drops from freezing to −18 °F (−28 °C) in the northern part of Heilongjiang.In April
  the mean temperature is above freezing for the whole of China, with the exception
  of extreme northern Heilongjiang. During that time the mean temperature for the
  Northeast Plain is between 36 and 46 °F (2 and 8 °C), and for the extensive plain
  between Beijing and Shanghai it is between 54 and 59 °F (12 and 15 °C). South of
  the Nan Mountains the mean temperature is considerably higher than 68 °F (20 °C).
  Along the coast of southern Guangdong, willows start to bud in late January, but
  in Beijing the budding of willows comes as late as early April.In summer the temperature
  range between North and South China is quite small. In July the difference in temperature
  between Guangzhou and Beijing is only about 5 °F (3 °C), and the isotherms in July
  are roughly parallel to the coastline. In July the isotherm of 82 °F (28 °C) marks
  an extensive area. The hottest places in China are found along the valleys of the
  middle and lower Yangtze. The mean July temperature of Nanchang and Changsha is
  well above 84 °F (29 °C), and in many years it exceeds 86 °F (30 °C).In North China
  autumn is generally cooler than spring. The mean October temperature in Beijing
  is about 55 °F (13 °C), and in April it is about 57 °F (14 °C). In South China the
  reverse is true. The mean October temperature in Guangzhou is 75 °F (24 °C), but
  in April it is only about 70 °F (21 °C).The middle and lower reaches of the Huang
  He are where China’s civilization and agriculture first developed. There the seasonal
  rhythm is well marked, and the duration of each season is evenly spaced. In other
  parts of China, however, the duration as well as the starting and closing dates
  of each season vary among different regions. Summer is nonexistent in northern Heilongjiang,
  while there is no winter in southern Guangdong. At Kunming, in the Yunnan uplands,
  the climate is mild throughout the year, with only brief summer and winter periods.In
  general, south of the Qin Mountains–Huai River line the mean daily temperature seldom
  falls below freezing, so that farming can be practiced year-round. In the Yangtze
  valley two crops are usually grown annually, but north of the Great Wall only one
  crop per year is possible.PrecipitationPrecipitation in China generally follows
  the same pattern as temperatures, decreasing from the southeast to the northwest.
  The annual total of certain areas along the southeastern coast amounts to more than
  80 inches (2,000 mm). The Yangtze valley receives about 40 to 45 inches (1,000 to
  1,150 mm). Farther north, in the Huai River valley, the annual rainfall decreases
  to some 35 inches (880 mm). In the lower reaches of the Huang He, only 20 to 25
  inches (500 to 650 mm) falls annually. The Northeast generally receives more precipitation
  than the North China Plain, with upwards of 40 or more inches falling in the Changbai
  Mountains.The southeast monsoon loses much of its moisture by the time it reaches
  the northern part of the Loess Plateau, where the annual precipitation is reduced
  to between 12 and 20 inches (300 and 500 mm). Northwest of a line linking the Da
  Hinggan (Greater Khingan), Yin, Lang, Qilian, and Altun ranges, the annual precipitation
  is less than 10 inches (250 mm). Because these regions are far from the sea, high
  mountains prevent the southern monsoon from reaching them, and only grasslands are
  found there. In western Inner Mongolia, the Gansu Corridor, and the Tarim Basin,
  the annual precipitation drops to 4 inches (100 mm) or less. These are areas of
  true desert, where sometimes not a single drop of moisture is received for several
  years.The Junggar Basin and the Ili River valley of northern Xinjiang are open to
  the influences of the westerlies, and precipitation is heavier there. Precipitation
  on the Plateau of Tibet, following the national pattern, decreases from southeast
  to northwest. More than 40 inches falls annually in the valleys in the southeastern
  part of the plateau, and the eastern edge receives 20 inches. However, in the enclosed
  Qaidam Basin in the north, the yearly total is only 4 to 10 inches.The high variability
  of precipitation is another characteristic of China’s climate. Usually, variability
  increases as annual amounts decrease, a circumstance that is closely connected with
  the country’s high frequency of drought and flood. Spring rain is of immense significance
  to Chinese farmers, but spring is also the season with the highest variability.
  In South China the variability exceeds 40 percent, along the Yangtze it is about
  45 percent, and in North China it is more than 50 percent. The variability of a
  vast area in North China exceeds 70 percent in some places; east of Beijing, for
  example, the rainfall variability in spring may even exceed 80 percent, as it also
  does in the central parts of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau.Rain falls mostly in the
  summer months, when plants need water the most. This is an important asset for farmers,
  but summer rainfall is usually too intense. In July, when the frontal zone shifts
  northward, cyclones (circulation of winds around centres of low atmospheric pressure)
  are much more active in North China than in South China, and North China begins
  to receive heavier rainfall. More than half the area of the North China Plain records
  0.8 inch (20 mm) of rainfall daily, and in some places it may reach as much as 1
  inch (25 mm) or more daily. During that time, areas south of the Yangtze are covered
  by the tropical Pacific air mass, so that the weather becomes comparatively stable,
  the amount of rainfall usually decreases, and the average rainfall intensity is
  less than that of June. The intensity of August rainfall is in general less than
  that of July.In the southeastern coastal regions, around Fuzhou and Shantou, the
  maximum daily rainfall may even approach 12 inches (300 mm). Such accumulations
  are directly related to the high frequency of typhoons (tropical cyclones) striking
  that part of the coast, usually during the period from May to November; July, August,
  and September are the three months when typhoons are the most frequent.In May, typhoons
  usually strike the coast south of Shantou. Later in June they shift northward, arriving
  between Shantou and Wenzhou, and after July they invade areas north of Wenzhou.
  August has the highest frequency of typhoon invasions, when more than one-third
  of the typhoons reaching China arrive. After September the frequency of typhoons
  decreases, and the pattern again shifts southward. In October, typhoons usually
  land south of Wenzhou; the late typhoons arriving in November and December strike
  south of Shantou.Plant and animal lifeFlorabambooJoan Lebold Cohen/Photo ResearchersChina’s
  great topological and climatic diversity has produced a vast array of natural vegetation
  types. The country’s total number of seed-plant species is approximately 30,000,
  representing some 2,700 genera; more than 200 of these genera are endemic to China.
  There are about 2,500 species of forest trees, including some 95 percent of the
  known broad-leaved types. Many of these trees are of economic importance, such as
  tung trees, camphor trees, varnish trees (Rhus verniciflua), star anise (which yields
  an oil used as a flavouring additive), and glossy privet (Ligustrum lucidum).Contributing
  to the variety and intermixture of tropical and temperate plants in China are such
  factors as the lack of insurmountable topographic barriers, such as large stretches
  of desert, between the tropical, temperate, and subalpine zones; wind systems that
  alternate in winter and summer; and the frequent occurrence of cyclones. If, for
  example, the vegetation of Heilongjiang province in the North and of Guangdong province
  in the South are compared, it is hardly possible to find a single common plant species,
  with the exception of certain weeds. In the taiga (boreal forest) zone of China’s
  northern border region or in the high mountains, on the other hand, there are many
  plant species that are also found in the lands within the Arctic Circle, while in
  the Chinese tropics there are species that also grow south of the Equator. However,
  from the ecological point of view, the tropical forests of South China generally
  do not differ greatly from those of Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries,
  and the desert and steppe vegetation of northwestern China is closely akin to that
  found in Mongolia or Kazakhstan. Furthermore, the Chinese taiga terrain of the frontier
  area adjoining Russia is essentially the same as that of Siberia.A traveler in China
  may encounter practically all types of natural vegetation indigenous to the Northern
  Hemisphere, the exception being species of the polar tundra. There are mangrove
  swamps along the shores of the South China Sea; rainforests on Hainan Island and
  in southern Yunnan; and deserts, steppes, meadows, and savannas elsewhere, as well
  as regions where tropical and temperate coniferous and evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved
  plants prevail.China may be divided—roughly along a diagonal from the southwest
  to the northeast—into two sharply different vegetation zones: the dry northwest
  and the humid southeast. The tropical area, adjoining the humid southeast, is geographically
  related more to Southeast Asia. In the northwest, where desertlike conditions prevail,
  are vast areas of sparse drought-resistant vegetation; within these areas, in the
  low-lying land and depressions, are patches of salt-tolerant plants, notably in
  the Junngar, Qaidam, and Gobi regions. Skirting the southern edge of the Gobi is
  a wide belt of grassland.Animal lifeThe profusion of vegetation types and a variety
  of relief have allowed a great diversity of animal life to develop and have permitted
  animals to survive there that elsewhere are extinct. Notable among such survivals
  are the great paddlefish of the Yangtze, the species of small alligator in eastern
  and central China, and the giant salamander (related to the Japanese giant salamander
  and the American hellbender) in western China. The diversity of animal life is perhaps
  greatest in the ranges and valleys of Tibet and Sichuan, the latter province being
  renowned as the home of the giant panda. The takin (a type of goat antelope), numerous
  species of pheasants, and a variety of laughing thrushes are found in all Chinese
  mountain ranges. China seems to be one of the chief centres of dispersal of the
  carp family and also of old-world catfishes.The regional affinities of Chinese animal
  life are complex. Resemblances in the Northeast are to the fauna of the Siberian
  forests. Animals from Central Asia inhabit suitable steppe areas in northern China.
  The life of the great mountain ranges is Palearctic (relating to a biogeographic
  region that includes Europe, Asia north of the Himalayas, northern Arabia, and Africa
  north of the Sahara) but with distinctively Chinese species or genera. To the southeast
  the lowlands and mountains alike permit direct access to the eastern region. This
  part of China presents a complete transition from temperate-zone Palearctic life
  to the wealth of tropical forms distinctive of southeastern Asia. Tropical types
  of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals predominate in the southernmost Chinese
  provinces.\r\n                \n\n        \n                    Quick Facts\n                \n

  Gongheguo or (Wade-Giles romanization) Chung-hua Jen-min Kung-ho-kuo, \n    country
  of East Asia. It is the largest of all Asian countries and has the largest population
  of any country in the world. Occupying nearly the entire East Asian landmass, it
  occupies approximately one-fourteenth of the land area of Earth. Among the major
  countries of the world, China is surpassed in area by only Russia and Canada, and
  it is almost as large as the whole of Europe.Shanghai: financial district© Jeremy
  Woodhouse/Getty ImagesChina has 33 administrative units directly under the central
  government; these consist of 22 provinces, 5 autonomous regions, 4 municipalities
  (Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin), and 2 special administrative regions
  (Hong Kong and Macau). The island province of Taiwan, which has been under separate
  administration since 1949, is discussed in the article Taiwan. Beijing (Peking),
  the capital of the People’s Republic, is also the cultural, economic, and communications
  centre of the country. Shanghai is the main industrial city; Hong Kong is the leading
  commercial centre and port.Within China’s boundaries exists a highly diverse and
  complex country. Its topography encompasses the highest and one of the lowest places
  on Earth, and its relief varies from nearly impenetrable mountainous terrain to
  vast coastal lowlands. Its climate ranges from extremely dry, desertlike conditions
  in the northwest to tropical monsoon in the southeast, and China has the greatest
  contrast in temperature between its northern and southern borders of any country
  in the world.The diversity of both China’s relief and its climate has resulted in
  one of the world’s widest arrays of ecological niches, and these niches have been
  filled by a vast number of plant and animal species. Indeed, practically all types
  of Northern Hemisphere plants, except those of the polar tundra, are found in China,
  and, despite the continuous inroads of humans over the millennia, China still is
  home to some of the world’s most exotic animals.Probably the single most identifiable
  characteristic of China to the people of the rest of the world is the size of its
  population. Some one-fifth of humanity is of Chinese nationality. The great majority
  of the population is Chinese (Han), and thus China is often characterized as an
  ethnically homogeneous country, but few countries have as wide a variety of indigenous
  peoples as does China. Even among the Han there are cultural and linguistic differences
  between regions; for example, the only point of linguistic commonality between two
  individuals from different parts of China may be the written Chinese language. Because
  China’s population is so enormous, the population density of the country is also
  often thought to be uniformly high, but vast areas of China are either uninhabited
  or sparsely populated.Great Wall of ChinaContunico © ZDF Enterprises GmbH, MainzWith
  more than 4,000 years of recorded history, China is one of the few existing countries
  that also flourished economically and culturally in the earliest stages of world
  civilization. Indeed, despite the political and social upheavals that frequently
  have ravaged the country, China is unique among nations in its longevity and resilience
  as a discrete politico-cultural unit. Much of China’s cultural development has been
  accomplished with relatively little outside influence, the introduction of Buddhism
  from India constituting a major exception. Even when the country was penetrated
  by such “barbarian” peoples as the Manchu, these groups soon became largely absorbed
  into the fabric of Han Chinese culture.This relative isolation from the outside
  world made possible over the centuries the flowering and refinement of the Chinese
  culture, but it also left China ill prepared to cope with that world when, from
  the mid-19th century, it was confronted by technologically superior foreign nations.
  There followed a century of decline and decrepitude, as China found itself relatively
  helpless in the face of a foreign onslaught. The trauma of this external challenge
  became the catalyst for a revolution that began in the early 20th century against
  the old regime and culminated in the establishment of a communist government in
  1949. This event reshaped global political geography, and China has since come to
  rank among the most influential countries in the world.Central to China’s long-enduring
  identity as a unitary country is the province, or sheng (“secretariat”). The provinces
  are traceable in their current form to the Tang dynasty (ad 618–907). Over the centuries,
  provinces gained in importance as centres of political and economic authority and
  increasingly became the focus of regional identification and loyalty. Provincial
  power reached its peak in the first two decades of the 20th century, but, since
  the establishment of the People’s Republic, that power has been curtailed by a strong
  central leadership in Beijing. Nonetheless, while the Chinese state has remained
  unitary in form, the vast size and population of China’s provinces—which are comparable
  to large and midsize nations—dictate their continuing importance as a level of subnational
  administration.ChinaChina stretches for about 3,250 miles (5,250 km) from east to
  west and 3,400 miles (5,500 km) from north to south. Its land frontier is about
  12,400 miles (20,000 km) in length, and its coastline extends for some 8,700 miles
  (14,000 km). The country is bounded by Mongolia to the north; Russia and North Korea
  to the northeast; the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea to the east; the South China
  Sea to the southeast; Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar (Burma), India, Bhutan, and Nepal to
  the south; Pakistan to the southwest; and Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and
  Kazakhstan to the west. In addition to the 14 countries that border directly on
  it, China also faces South Korea and Japan, across the Yellow Sea, and the Philippines,
  which lie beyond the South China Sea.Kyrgyz: mosqueDugald Bremner/StoneBroadly speaking,
  the relief of China is high in the west and low in the east; consequently, the direction
  of flow of the major rivers is generally eastward. The surface may be divided into
  three steps, or levels. The first level is represented by the Plateau of Tibet,
  which is located in both the Tibet Autonomous Region and the province of Qinghai
  and which, with an average elevation of well over 13,000 feet (4,000 metres) above
  sea level, is the loftiest highland area in the world. The western part of this
  region, the Qiangtang, has an average height of 16,500 feet (5,000 metres) and is
  known as the “roof of the world.”The second step lies to the north of the Kunlun
  and Qilian mountains and (farther south) to the east of the Qionglai and Daliang
  ranges. There the mountains descend sharply to heights of between 6,000 and 3,000
  feet (1,800 and 900 metres), after which basins intermingle with plateaus. This
  step includes the Mongolian Plateau, the Tarim Basin, the Loess Plateau (loess is
  a yellow-gray dust deposited by the wind), the Sichuan Basin, and the Yunnan-Guizhou
  (Yungui) Plateau.The third step extends from the east of the Dalou, Taihang, and
  Wu mountain ranges and from the eastern perimeter of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau
  to the China Sea. Almost all of this area is made up of hills and plains lying below
  1,500 feet (450 metres).The most remarkable feature of China’s relief is the vast
  extent of its mountain chains; the mountains, indeed, have exerted a tremendous
  influence on the country’s political, economic, and cultural development. By rough
  estimate, about one-third of the total area of China consists of mountains. China
  has the world’s tallest mountain and the world’s highest and largest plateau, in
  addition to possessing extensive coastal plains. The five major landforms—mountain,
  plateau, hill, plain, and basin—are all well represented. China’s complex natural
  environment and rich natural resources are closely connected with the varied nature
  of its relief.The topography of China is marked by many splendours. Mount Everest
  (Qomolangma Feng), situated on the border between China and Nepal, is the highest
  peak in the world, at an elevation of 29,035 feet (8,850 metres; see Researcher’s
  Note: Height of Mount Everest). By contrast, the lowest part of the Turfan Depression
  in the Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang—Lake Ayding—is 508 feet (155 metres)
  below sea level. The coast of China contrasts greatly between South and North. To
  the south of the bay of Hangzhou, the coast is rocky and indented with many harbours
  and offshore islands. To the north, except along the Shandong and Liaodong peninsulas,
  the coast is sandy and flat.China is prone to intense seismic activity throughout
  much of the country. The main source of this geologic instability is the result
  of the constant northward movement of the Indian tectonic plate beneath southern
  Asia, which has thrust up the towering mountains and high plateaus of the Chinese
  southwest. Throughout its history China has experienced hundreds of massive earthquakes
  that collectively have killed millions of people. Two in the 20th century alone—in
  eastern Gansu province (1920) and in the city of Tangshan, eastern Hebei province
  (1976)—caused some 250,000 deaths each, and a quake in east-central Sichuan province
  in 2008 killed tens of thousands and devastated a wide area.China’s physical relief
  has dictated its development in many respects. The civilization of Han Chinese originated
  in the southern part of the Loess Plateau, and from there it extended outward until
  it encountered the combined barriers of relief and climate. The long, protruding
  corridor, commonly known as the Gansu, or Hexi, Corridor, illustrates this fact.
  South of the corridor is the Plateau of Tibet, which was too high and too cold for
  the Chinese to gain a foothold. North of the corridor is the Gobi Desert, which
  also formed a barrier. Consequently, Chinese civilization was forced to spread along
  the corridor, where melting snow and ice in the Qilian Mountains provided water
  for oasis farming. The westward extremities of the corridor became the meeting place
  of the ancient East and West.Thus, for a long time the ancient political centre
  of China was located along the lower reaches of the Huang He (Yellow River). Because
  of topographical barriers, however, it was difficult for the central government
  to gain complete control over the entire country, except when an unusually strong
  dynasty was in power. In many instances the Sichuan Basin—an isolated region in
  southwestern China, about twice the size of Scotland, that is well protected by
  high mountains and is self-sufficient in agricultural products—became an independent
  kingdom. A comparable situation often arose in the Tarim Basin in the northwest.
  Linked to the rest of China only by the Gansu Corridor, this basin is even remoter
  than the Sichuan, and, when the central government was unable to exert its influence,
  oasis states were established; only the three strong dynasties—the Han (206 bc–ad
  220), the Tang (ad 618–907), and the Qing, or Manchu (1644–1911/12)—were capable
  of controlling the region.Apart from the three elevation zones already mentioned,
  it is possible—on the basis of geologic structure, climatic conditions, and differences
  in geomorphologic development—to divide China into three major topographic regions:
  the eastern, northwestern, and southwestern zones. The eastern zone is shaped by
  the rivers, which have eroded landforms in some parts and have deposited alluvial
  plains in others; its climate is monsoonal (characterized by seasonal rain-bearing
  winds). The northwestern region is arid and eroded by the wind; it forms an inland
  drainage basin. The southwest is a cold, lofty, and mountainous region containing
  intermontane plateaus and inland lakes.The three basic regions may be further subdivided
  into second-order geographic divisions. The eastern region contains 10 of these,
  the southwest contains two, and the northwest contains three. Below is a brief description
  of each division.Da Hinggan RangeRichard Harrington/ComstockThe Northeast Plain
  (also known as the Manchurian Plain and the Sung-liao Plain) is located in China’s
  Northeast, the region formerly known as Manchuria. It is bordered to the west and
  north by the Da Hinggan (Greater Khingan) Range and to the east by the Xiao Hinggan
  (Lesser Khingan) Range. An undulating plain split into northern and southern halves
  by a low divide rising from 500 to 850 feet (150 to 260 metres), it is drained in
  its northern part by the Sungari River and tributaries and in its southern part
  by the Liao River. Most of the area has an erosional rather than a depositional
  surface, but it is covered with a deep soil. The plain has an area of about 135,000
  square miles (350,000 square km). Its basic landscapes are forest-steppe, steppe,
  meadow-steppe, and cultivated land; its soils are rich and black, and it is a famous
  agricultural region. The river valleys are wide and flat with a series of terraces
  formed by deposits of silt. During the flood season the rivers inundate extensive
  areas.To the southeast of the Northeast Plain is a series of ranges comprising the
  Changbai, Zhangguangcai, and Wanda mountains, which in Chinese are collectively
  known as the Changbai Shan, or “Forever White Mountains”; broken by occasional open
  valleys, they reach elevations mostly between 1,500 and 3,000 feet (450 and 900
  metres). In some parts the scenery is characterized by rugged peaks and precipitous
  cliffs. The highest peak is the volcanic cone of Mount Baitou (9,003 feet [2,744
  metres]), which has a beautiful crater lake at its snow-covered summit. As one of
  the major forest areas of China, the region is the source of many valuable furs
  and famous medicinal herbs. Cultivation is generally limited to the valley floors.Comparable
  in size to the Northeast Plain, most of the North China Plain lies at elevations
  below 160 feet (50 metres), and the relief is monotonously flat. It was formed by
  enormous sedimentary deposits brought down by the Huang He and Huai River from the
  Loess Plateau; the Quaternary deposits alone (i.e., those from the past 2.6 million
  years) reach thicknesses of 2,500 to 3,000 feet (760 to 900 metres). The river channels,
  which are higher than the surrounding locality, form local water divides, and the
  areas between the channels are depressions in which lakes and swamps are found.
  In particularly low and flat areas, the underground water table often fluctuates
  from 5 to 6.5 feet (1.5 to 2 metres), forming meadow swamps and, in some places,
  resulting in saline soils. A densely populated area that has long been under settlement,
  the North China Plain has the highest proportion of land under cultivation of any
  region in China.Yan RiverA.Topping—Rapho/Photo ResearchersThis vast plateau of some
  154,000 square miles (400,000 square km) forms a unique region of loess-clad hills
  and barren mountains between the North China Plain and the deserts of the west.
  In the north the Great Wall of China forms the boundary, while the southern limit
  is the Qin Mountains in Shaanxi province. The average surface elevation is roughly
  4,000 feet (1,200 metres), but individual ranges of bedrock are higher, reaching
  9,825 feet (2,995 metres) in the Liupan Mountains. Most of the plateau is covered
  with loess to thicknesses of 165 to 260 feet (50 to 80 metres). In northern Shaanxi
  and eastern Gansu provinces, the loess may reach much greater thicknesses. The loess
  is particularly susceptible to erosion by water, and ravines and gorges crisscross
  the plateau. It has been estimated that ravines cover approximately half the entire
  region, with erosion reaching depths of 300 to 650 feet (90 to 200 metres).These
  hills are basically composed of extremely ancient crystalline shales and granites
  of early Precambrian age (i.e., older than about 2.5 billion years) and of somewhat
  younger sedimentary rocks dating to about 540–420 million years ago. Faults have
  played a major role in creating the present relief, and, as a result, many hills
  are horsts (blocks of the Earth’s crust uplifted along faults), while the valleys
  have been formed by grabens (blocks of the Earth’s crust that have been thrust down
  along faults). The Jiaolai Plain divides this region into two parts. The eastern
  part is lower, lying at elevations averaging below 1,500 feet (450 metres), with
  only certain peaks and ridges rising to 2,500 feet and (rarely) to 3,000 feet (900
  metres); the highest point, Mount Lao, reaches 3,714 feet (1,132 metres). The western
  part is slightly higher, rising to 5,000 feet (1,524 metres) at Mount Tai, one of
  China’s most sacred mountains. The Shandong Hills meet the sea along a rocky and
  indented shoreline.The Qin (conventional Tsinling) Mountains in Shaanxi province
  are the greatest chain of mountains east of the Plateau of Tibet. The mountain chain
  consists of a high and rugged barrier extending from Gansu to Henan; geographers
  use a line between the chain and the Huai River to divide China proper into two
  parts—North and South. The elevation of the mountains varies from 3,000 to 10,000
  feet (900 to 3,000 metres). The western part is higher, with the highest peak, Mount
  Taibai, rising to 12,359 feet (3,767 metres). The Qin Mountains consist of a series
  of parallel ridges, all running roughly west-east, separated by a maze of ramifying
  valleys whose canyon walls often rise sheer to a height of 1,000 feet (300 metres)
  above the valley streams.This is one of the most attractive geographical regions
  of China. The Sichuan Basin is surrounded by mountains, which are higher in the
  west and north. Protected against the penetration of cold northern winds, the basin
  is much warmer in the winter than are the more southerly plains of southeast China.
  Except for the Chengdu Plain, the region is hilly. The relief of the basin’s eastern
  half consists of numerous folds, forming a series of ridges and valleys that trend
  northeast to southwest. The lack of arable land has obliged farmers to cultivate
  the slopes of the hills, on which they have built terraces that frequently cover
  the slopes from top to bottom. The terracing has slowed down the process of erosion
  and has made it possible to cultivate additional areas by using the steeper slopes—some
  of which have grades up to 45° or more.Southeastern China is bordered by a rocky
  shoreline backed by picturesque mountains. In general, there is a distinct structural
  and topographic trend from northeast to southwest. The higher peaks may reach elevations
  of some 5,000 to 6,500 feet (1,500 to 2,000 metres). The rivers are short and fast-flowing
  and have cut steep-sided valleys. The chief areas of settlement are on narrow strips
  of coastal plain where rice is produced. Along the coast there are numerous islands,
  where the fishing industry is well developed.East of Yichang, in Hubei province,
  a series of plains of uneven width are found along the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang).
  The plains are particularly wide in the delta area and in places where the Yangtze
  receives its major tributaries—including large areas of lowlands around Dongting,
  Poyang, Tai, and Hongze lakes, which are all hydrologically linked with the Yangtze.
  The region is an alluvial plain, the accumulation of sediment laid down by the rivers
  throughout long ages. There are a few isolated hills, but in general the land is
  level, lying mostly below 160 feet (50 metres). Rivers, canals, and lakes form a
  dense network of waterways. The surface of the plain has been converted into a system
  of flat terraces, which descend in steps along the slopes of the valleys.The Nan
  Mountains (Nan Ling) are composed of many ranges of mountains running from northeast
  to southwest. These ranges form the watershed between the Yangtze to the north and
  the Pearl (Zhu) River to the south. The main peaks along the watershed are above
  5,000 feet, and some are more than 6,500 feet. But a large part of the land to the
  south of the Nan Mountains is also hilly; flatland does not exceed 10 percent of
  the total area. The Pearl River Delta is the only extensive plain in this region
  and is also the richest part of South China. The coastline is rugged and irregular,
  and there are many promontories and protected bays, including those of Hong Kong
  and Macau. The principal river is the Xi River, which rises in the highlands of
  eastern Yunnan and southern Guizhou.This region comprises the northern part of Yunnan
  and the western part of Guizhou; its edge is highly dissected. Yunnan is more distinctly
  a plateau and contains larger areas of rolling uplands than Guizhou, but both parts
  are distinguished by canyonlike valleys and precipitous mountains. The highest elevations
  lie in the west, where Mount Diancang (also called Cang Shan) rises to 13,524 feet
  (4,122 metres). In the valleys of the major rivers, elevations drop to about 1,300
  to 1,600 feet (400 to 490 metres). Particularly sharp differences in elevation and
  the greatest ruggedness of relief occur in the western part of the region, in the
  gorges of the large rivers. In the eastern part, karst processes (creating sinks,
  ravines, and underground streams in the limestone landscape) have developed very
  strongly. Scattered throughout the highlands are small lake basins, separated by
  mountains.Brahmaputra River: stupa© Naomi Duguid/Asia AccessThis great upland massif
  occupies about one-fourth of the country’s area. A large part of the plateau lies
  at elevations above 13,000 to 16,500 feet (4,000 to 5,000 metres). The border ranges
  of the plateau (the Kunlun Mountains and the Himalayas) are even higher, with individual
  peaks rising to heights of 23,000 to 26,000 feet (7,000 to 8,000 metres) and higher.
  As a rule, the interior (i.e., Tibet-side) slopes of these border mountains are
  gentle, while the exterior slopes are precipitous. The plateau’s eastern and southern
  periphery is the source of many of the world’s great rivers, including the Yangtze,
  Huang He, Mekong, Salween, Indus, and Brahmaputra. Only in the low valleys, chiefly
  along the Brahmaputra valley, are there centres of human settlement.The Qaidam (Tsaidam)
  Basin, occupying the northwestern portion of the Plateau of Tibet, is the largest,
  as well as the lowest, depression in the plateau. The broad northwestern part of
  the basin lies at elevations between approximately 8,800 and 10,000 feet (2,700
  and 3,000 metres), and the narrow southeastern part is slightly lower. Gravel, sandy
  and clay deserts, semideserts, and salt wastes predominate within the basin.Kunlun
  Mountains© Jeffrey Alford/Asia AccessNorth of the Plateau of Tibet and at the much
  lower elevation of about 3,000 feet (900 metres) lies the Tarim Basin. It is hemmed
  in by great mountain ranges: the Tien Shan (Tian Shan; “Celestial Mountains”) on
  the north, the Pamirs on the west, and the Kunlun Mountains on the south. Glacier-fed
  streams descend from these heights only to lose themselves in the loose sands and
  gravels of the Takla Makan Desert, which occupies the centre of the basin. The Takla
  Makan is one of the most barren of the world’s deserts; only a few of the largest
  rivers—such as the Tarim and Hotan (Khotan)—cross the desert, but even their flow
  is not constant, and they have water throughout their entire courses only during
  the flood period. The area of the basin is about 215,000 square miles (557,000 square
  km), and its elevations range from 2,500 to 4,600 feet (750 to 1,400 metres) above
  sea level. Its surface slants to the southeast, where Lop Nur (a salt-encrusted
  lake bed) is situated.North of the Tarim Basin is another large depression, the
  Junggar (Dzungarian) Basin. It is enclosed by the Tien Shan on the south, while
  to the northeast it is cut off from Mongolia by the Altai Mountains. The surface
  of the basin is flat, with a gentle slope to the southwest. The larger portion of
  the land lies at elevations between about 1,000 and 1,500 feet (300 and 450 metres),
  and in the lowest part the elevation drops to just below 650 feet (200 metres).
  In general the main part of the basin is covered by a broad desert with barchans
  (crescent-shaped sand dunes that move); only in certain parts are dunes retained
  by vegetation.Bogda MountainsK. Scholz/Shostal AssociatesThe Chinese (eastern) part
  of the Tien Shan consists of a complex system of ranges and depressions divided
  into two major groups of ranges: the northern and the southern. The groups are separated
  by a strip of intermontane depressions that itself is broken up by the interior
  ranges. Ancient metamorphic rock constitutes the larger portion of the ranges in
  the interior zone; Paleozoic (i.e., about 250 to 540 million years old) sedimentary
  and igneous sedimentary beds form its northern and southern chains, while Mesozoic
  (about 65 to 250 million years old) sandstones and conglomerates fill the intermontane
  depressions in the interior zone and constitute the foothill ridges. The height
  of the main Chinese chains of the Tien Shan is between 13,000 and 15,000 feet (4,000
  and 4,600 metres), with individual peaks exceeding 16,000 feet (4,900 metres); the
  interior chains reach 14,500 feet (4,400 metres). In the western part, where precipitation
  is adequate, large glaciers are formed, reaching a length of more than 20 miles
  (32 km). Large rivers with heavy flows, such as the Ili (Yili) River and its tributaries,
  begin their courses there, and the predominantly alpine meadow steppe is one of
  the best grazing lands of China.Huang He: junks on the Huang HeTim Megarry/Robert
  Harding Picture LibraryChina has more than 50,000 rivers with individual drainage
  areas exceeding 40 square miles (100 square km). Of the total annual runoff, about
  95 percent drains directly into the sea (more than 80 percent into the Pacific Ocean,
  12 percent into the Indian Ocean, and less than 1 percent into the Arctic Ocean)
  and 5 percent disappears inland.The three principal rivers of China, all of which
  flow generally from west to east, draining into the China Sea, are the Huang He,
  the Yangtze, and the Xi. The Huang He, which rises in the Kunlun Mountains, is the
  northernmost of the three; it drains into the Bo Hai (Gulf of Chihli), north of
  the Shandong Peninsula. The Yangtze, the longest river in the country, rises in
  the Tibetan Highlands and flows across central China, draining into the East China
  Sea north of Shanghai. The Xi River, the southernmost of the three, rises in the
  Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and empties into the South China Sea via the Pearl River
  Delta at Guangzhou (Canton).The distribution of surface water in China is extremely
  uneven. Only a small part of the country has sufficient quantities year-round. Much
  of the country has abundant runoff but only during the rainy summer, when enormous
  surpluses of water are received. From the southeast to the northwest, the surface
  water decreases as the relief becomes more mountainous. A vast area of the northwest
  lacks water throughout the year. North China (north of the Qin Mountains–Huai River
  line), with its flat relief and long history of agriculture, contains almost two-thirds
  of China’s cultivated land; paradoxically, because of scanty and erratic precipitation,
  the average annual runoff in the North accounts for only about one-sixth of the
  total for the country as a whole.The mountains of the southeast and the mountainous
  Hainan Island have the most abundant surface water. Over the year they receive more
  than 60 inches (1,500 mm) of precipitation (in some places even more than 80 inches
  [2,000 mm]), of which almost two-thirds constitutes the runoff, so that a dense
  drainage network has developed. The amount of runoff is highest in the southeast,
  exceeding 40 inches (1,000 mm). It gradually diminishes toward the west and north,
  so that in the true deserts of the northwest it is usually less than 0.4 of an inch
  (10 mm). The arid climate of the northwest is reflected in the landscape of the
  dry steppes, which is characterized by richer grasses in the east, while in the
  west the landscape gradually changes to bare deserts.In the lower reaches of the
  Yangtze, the Pearl River Delta, and the Chengdu Plain a dense network of waterways
  has been developed. In the North China Plain and the Northeast Plain most of the
  rivers have a linear flow, and tributaries are few and unconnected. In the inland
  drainage area there are very few rivers because of scanty precipitation. Extensive
  areas such as the Tarim Basin and northeastern Gansu province are often completely
  devoid of runoff. In those regions the rivers depend on melted snow and ice; in
  consequence, they are mostly small and are found only in mountains and mountain
  foothills. As they drain increasingly farther away from the mountains, most of them
  eventually disappear in the desert, while some form inland lakes. Because the northern
  part of the Plateau of Tibet is a cold desert, the rate of evaporation is slow,
  so that a denser network of rivers has developed; most of these, however, run into
  glaciated depressions, forming numerous lakes.China, with its vast and diverse climatic
  conditions, has a wide variety of soils. Indeed, all the soil types of the Eurasian
  continent, except the soils of the tundra and the highly leached podzolic-gley soils
  of the northern taiga (boreal forest), are found in China. As a result of the climatic
  differences between the drier and cooler North and the wetter and hotter South,
  soils may be grouped into two classifications. Generally speaking, the soils north
  of the Qin Mountains–Huai River line are pedocals (calcareous) and are neutral to
  alkaline in reaction; those south of this line are pedalfers (leached noncalcareous
  soils), which are neutral to acid.Apart from the great plateaus and high mountains
  to the southwest, marked soil zones are formed in China according to differences
  in climate, vegetation, and distance from the sea. The east and southeast coastal
  region is covered by the forest zone associated with a humid and semihumid climate,
  while the north and northwest inland regions belong mostly to the steppe zone, as
  well as to the semidesert and desert zone associated with a semiarid and arid climate.
  Between these two broad soil zones lies a transitional zone—the forest-steppe zone,
  where forest soils merge gradually with steppe soils.Between the pedocals of the
  North and the pedalfers of the South lie the neutral soils. The floodplain of the
  Yangtze below the Three Gorges (the point where the river cuts through the Wu Mountains
  to empty onto the Hubei Plain) is overlain with a thick cover of noncalcareous alluvium.
  These soils, sometimes classified as paddy (rice-growing) soils, for the most part
  are exceedingly fertile and of good texture. The paddy soil is a unique type of
  cultivated soil, formed over a long period of time under the specific conditions
  of intensive rice cultivation.Along the coast of North China are belts of saline
  and alkaline soil. They are associated with a combination of poor drainage and aridity,
  where precipitation is insufficient either to dissolve or to carry away the salts
  in solution.The adverse effects of nature on the soil have been further intensified
  by centuries of concentrated cultivation, which has resulted in an almost universal
  deficiency of nitrogen and organic matter. The shortage of organic matter is primarily
  because farmers habitually remove crop stalks and leaves for livestock feed and
  fuel. The animal and human waste used for fertilizer contains too small an amount
  of organic matter to compensate for the loss of nutrients in the soil. The soils
  are also often deficient in phosphorus and potassium, but these deficiencies are
  neither so widespread nor so severe as that of nitrogen.At one time, half of the
  territory of present-day China may have been covered by forests, but now less than
  one-tenth of the country is forested. Extensive forests in central and southern
  China were cleared for farmlands, resulting in the inevitable erosion of soils from
  the hillsides and their deposition in the valleys. Farmers have constructed level
  terraces, supported by walls, in order to hold back water for rice fields, thus
  effectively controlling erosion. Wherever elaborate terraces have been built, soil
  erosion is virtually absent, and stepped terraces have become one of the characteristic
  features of the rural landscape.Excessive grazing and other practices that destroy
  the grass cover have also produced soil loss. When its valuable crumb structure
  is broken down and its porosity is lost, the topsoil is easily washed away through
  erosion in the rainy season; the wind produces the same effect in dry regions. The
  Loess Plateau, constantly buffeted by rain and wind, is especially vulnerable to
  soil erosion, which results in a distinctive landscape. Deep, steep-sided gullies
  cut the plateau into fantastic relief. The damage done by heavy rain in summer includes
  not only topsoil loss but also frequent flooding by silt-laden rivers.The vast and
  topographically varied landmass of China lies in Asia, the world’s largest continent,
  and faces the Pacific, the world’s largest ocean, along an extensive shoreline.
  The country’s climate is thus heavily influenced by the seasonal movement of large
  air masses between the Pacific and the Chinese mainland. The polar continental air
  mass, originating to the north in Siberia, dominates a large part of China during
  the winter; likewise, the tropical Pacific air mass exerts its influence during
  the summer. The sharply varied climatic conditions prevailing in summer and in winter
  are a direct result of the interaction of these two air masses, which are entirely
  different in nature.The Siberian air mass, which is quite stable, is extremely cold
  and dry and often has marked layers of temperature inversion. After crossing the
  Mongolian Plateau, the air mass spreads southward and begins to invade North China,
  where it undergoes a series of rapid changes; its temperature rises slightly, and
  its stability decreases. During the day the air there may be quite warm, but at
  night or in shaded places the cold is often unbearable. In general, the diurnal
  (daily) range of temperature is more than 18 °F (10 °C); in extreme cases it may
  exceed 45 °F (25 °C). Because North China is affected by this air mass most of the
  time, it is dry, with clear weather and an abundance of sunshine during the winter
  months.The prevailing winter wind blows from November through March, but it changes
  direction as it moves to the south. In northern and northeastern China its direction
  is from the northwest, in eastern China it comes from the north, and on the southeastern
  coasts it is from the northeast. The height of the winter wind belt usually does
  not exceed 13,000 feet (4,000 metres). As it moves to the south, the height decreases;
  in Nanjing it is about 6,500 feet (2,000 metres), and in South China it is less
  than 5,000 feet (1,500 metres). The Qin Mountains become an effective barrier to
  the advance of the cold waves to the south, particularly in the western section,
  where the average elevation of the mountains is mainly between 6,500 and 9,000 feet
  (2,000 and 2,700 metres).In China the tropical Pacific air mass is the chief source
  of summer rainfall. When it predominates, it may cover the eastern half of China
  and penetrate deep into the border areas of the Mongolian Plateau and onto the eastern
  edge of the Plateau of Tibet. In summer the Siberian air mass retreats to the western
  end of Mongolia, although it occasionally penetrates southward and sometimes may
  reach the Huai River valley, which constitutes a summertime battleground between
  the tropical Pacific and Siberian air masses.The movement of the two air masses
  is of immense significance to the climate of central and North China. In summer,
  when the tropical air mass predominates, the frontal zone between the two shifts
  northward; as a result, North China receives heavier rainfall. When the southeastern
  monsoon slackens, however, the frontal zone moves southward, and central China receives
  more rainfall, which can cause flooding. The activity of the tropical Pacific air
  mass in winter is confined to the southeast coastal areas; during that season, therefore,
  it frequently drizzles in the hilly areas south of the Nan Mountains, and morning
  fog is common.Besides these two air masses, three other air masses also influence
  China’s climate: the equatorial continental air mass (a highly unstable southwest
  monsoon), the polar maritime air mass, and the equatorial maritime air mass. Furthermore,
  because China is so vast and has such complex topography, the interaction between
  the air masses and relief produces a wide range of climatic conditions.Temperatures
  generally decrease from south to north. The mean annual temperature is above 68
  °F (20 °C) in the Pearl River valley. It decreases to between 59 and 68 °F (15 and
  20 °C) in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze, to about 50 °F (10 °C) in
  North China and the southern part of Xinjiang, and to 41 °F (5 °C) in the southern
  area of the Northeast, the northern part of Xinjiang, and places near the Great
  Wall. It drops below 32 °F (0 °C; i.e., freezing) in the northern part of Heilongjiang.
  The annual range of temperature between the extreme south and north is about 86
  °F (48 °C). With few exceptions, January is the coldest month and July is the hottest.South
  of the Qin Mountains–Huai River line, the mean January temperature increases progressively,
  rising from freezing to 72 °F (22 °C) on the southern coast of Hainan Island. Snow
  rarely falls, and the rivers do not freeze. North of this line, the temperature
  drops from freezing to −18 °F (−28 °C) in the northern part of Heilongjiang.In April
  the mean temperature is above freezing for the whole of China, with the exception
  of extreme northern Heilongjiang. During that time the mean temperature for the
  Northeast Plain is between 36 and 46 °F (2 and 8 °C), and for the extensive plain
  between Beijing and Shanghai it is between 54 and 59 °F (12 and 15 °C). South of
  the Nan Mountains the mean temperature is considerably higher than 68 °F (20 °C).
  Along the coast of southern Guangdong, willows start to bud in late January, but
  in Beijing the budding of willows comes as late as early April.In summer the temperature
  range between North and South China is quite small. In July the difference in temperature
  between Guangzhou and Beijing is only about 5 °F (3 °C), and the isotherms in July
  are roughly parallel to the coastline. In July the isotherm of 82 °F (28 °C) marks
  an extensive area. The hottest places in China are found along the valleys of the
  middle and lower Yangtze. The mean July temperature of Nanchang and Changsha is
  well above 84 °F (29 °C), and in many years it exceeds 86 °F (30 °C).In North China
  autumn is generally cooler than spring. The mean October temperature in Beijing
  is about 55 °F (13 °C), and in April it is about 57 °F (14 °C). In South China the
  reverse is true. The mean October temperature in Guangzhou is 75 °F (24 °C), but
  in April it is only about 70 °F (21 °C).The middle and lower reaches of the Huang
  He are where China’s civilization and agriculture first developed. There the seasonal
  rhythm is well marked, and the duration of each season is evenly spaced. In other
  parts of China, however, the duration as well as the starting and closing dates
  of each season vary among different regions. Summer is nonexistent in northern Heilongjiang,
  while there is no winter in southern Guangdong. At Kunming, in the Yunnan uplands,
  the climate is mild throughout the year, with only brief summer and winter periods.In
  general, south of the Qin Mountains–Huai River line the mean daily temperature seldom
  falls below freezing, so that farming can be practiced year-round. In the Yangtze
  valley two crops are usually grown annually, but north of the Great Wall only one
  crop per year is possible.Precipitation in China generally follows the same pattern
  as temperatures, decreasing from the southeast to the northwest. The annual total
  of certain areas along the southeastern coast amounts to more than 80 inches (2,000
  mm). The Yangtze valley receives about 40 to 45 inches (1,000 to 1,150 mm). Farther
  north, in the Huai River valley, the annual rainfall decreases to some 35 inches
  (880 mm). In the lower reaches of the Huang He, only 20 to 25 inches (500 to 650
  mm) falls annually. The Northeast generally receives more precipitation than the
  North China Plain, with upwards of 40 or more inches falling in the Changbai Mountains.The
  southeast monsoon loses much of its moisture by the time it reaches the northern
  part of the Loess Plateau, where the annual precipitation is reduced to between
  12 and 20 inches (300 and 500 mm). Northwest of a line linking the Da Hinggan (Greater
  Khingan), Yin, Lang, Qilian, and Altun ranges, the annual precipitation is less
  than 10 inches (250 mm). Because these regions are far from the sea, high mountains
  prevent the southern monsoon from reaching them, and only grasslands are found there.
  In western Inner Mongolia, the Gansu Corridor, and the Tarim Basin, the annual precipitation
  drops to 4 inches (100 mm) or less. These are areas of true desert, where sometimes
  not a single drop of moisture is received for several years.The Junggar Basin and
  the Ili River valley of northern Xinjiang are open to the influences of the westerlies,
  and precipitation is heavier there. Precipitation on the Plateau of Tibet, following
  the national pattern, decreases from southeast to northwest. More than 40 inches
  falls annually in the valleys in the southeastern part of the plateau, and the eastern
  edge receives 20 inches. However, in the enclosed Qaidam Basin in the north, the
  yearly total is only 4 to 10 inches.The high variability of precipitation is another
  characteristic of China’s climate. Usually, variability increases as annual amounts
  decrease, a circumstance that is closely connected with the country’s high frequency
  of drought and flood. Spring rain is of immense significance to Chinese farmers,
  but spring is also the season with the highest variability. In South China the variability
  exceeds 40 percent, along the Yangtze it is about 45 percent, and in North China
  it is more than 50 percent. The variability of a vast area in North China exceeds
  70 percent in some places; east of Beijing, for example, the rainfall variability
  in spring may even exceed 80 percent, as it also does in the central parts of the
  Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau.Rain falls mostly in the summer months, when plants need
  water the most. This is an important asset for farmers, but summer rainfall is usually
  too intense. In July, when the frontal zone shifts northward, cyclones (circulation
  of winds around centres of low atmospheric pressure) are much more active in North
  China than in South China, and North China begins to receive heavier rainfall. More
  than half the area of the North China Plain records 0.8 inch (20 mm) of rainfall
  daily, and in some places it may reach as much as 1 inch (25 mm) or more daily.
  During that time, areas south of the Yangtze are covered by the tropical Pacific
  air mass, so that the weather becomes comparatively stable, the amount of rainfall
  usually decreases, and the average rainfall intensity is less than that of June.
  The intensity of August rainfall is in general less than that of July.In the southeastern
  coastal regions, around Fuzhou and Shantou, the maximum daily rainfall may even
  approach 12 inches (300 mm). Such accumulations are directly related to the high
  frequency of typhoons (tropical cyclones) striking that part of the coast, usually
  during the period from May to November; July, August, and September are the three
  months when typhoons are the most frequent.In May, typhoons usually strike the coast
  south of Shantou. Later in June they shift northward, arriving between Shantou and
  Wenzhou, and after July they invade areas north of Wenzhou. August has the highest
  frequency of typhoon invasions, when more than one-third of the typhoons reaching
  China arrive. After September the frequency of typhoons decreases, and the pattern
  again shifts southward. In October, typhoons usually land south of Wenzhou; the

  Lebold Cohen/Photo ResearchersChina’s great topological and climatic diversity has
  produced a vast array of natural vegetation types. The country’s total number of
  seed-plant species is approximately 30,000, representing some 2,700 genera; more
  than 200 of these genera are endemic to China. There are about 2,500 species of
  forest trees, including some 95 percent of the known broad-leaved types. Many of
  these trees are of economic importance, such as tung trees, camphor trees, varnish
  trees (Rhus verniciflua), star anise (which yields an oil used as a flavouring additive),
  and glossy privet (Ligustrum lucidum).Contributing to the variety and intermixture
  of tropical and temperate plants in China are such factors as the lack of insurmountable
  topographic barriers, such as large stretches of desert, between the tropical, temperate,
  and subalpine zones; wind systems that alternate in winter and summer; and the frequent
  occurrence of cyclones. If, for example, the vegetation of Heilongjiang province
  in the North and of Guangdong province in the South are compared, it is hardly possible
  to find a single common plant species, with the exception of certain weeds. In the
  taiga (boreal forest) zone of China’s northern border region or in the high mountains,
  on the other hand, there are many plant species that are also found in the lands
  within the Arctic Circle, while in the Chinese tropics there are species that also
  grow south of the Equator. However, from the ecological point of view, the tropical
  forests of South China generally do not differ greatly from those of Indonesia and
  other Southeast Asian countries, and the desert and steppe vegetation of northwestern
  China is closely akin to that found in Mongolia or Kazakhstan. Furthermore, the
  Chinese taiga terrain of the frontier area adjoining Russia is essentially the same
  as that of Siberia.A traveler in China may encounter practically all types of natural
  vegetation indigenous to the Northern Hemisphere, the exception being species of
  the polar tundra. There are mangrove swamps along the shores of the South China
  Sea; rainforests on Hainan Island and in southern Yunnan; and deserts, steppes,
  meadows, and savannas elsewhere, as well as regions where tropical and temperate
  coniferous and evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved plants prevail.China may be
  divided—roughly along a diagonal from the southwest to the northeast—into two sharply
  different vegetation zones: the dry northwest and the humid southeast. The tropical
  area, adjoining the humid southeast, is geographically related more to Southeast
  Asia. In the northwest, where desertlike conditions prevail, are vast areas of sparse
  drought-resistant vegetation; within these areas, in the low-lying land and depressions,
  are patches of salt-tolerant plants, notably in the Junngar, Qaidam, and Gobi regions.
  Skirting the southern edge of the Gobi is a wide belt of grassland.The profusion
  of vegetation types and a variety of relief have allowed a great diversity of animal
  life to develop and have permitted animals to survive there that elsewhere are extinct.
  Notable among such survivals are the great paddlefish of the Yangtze, the species
  of small alligator in eastern and central China, and the giant salamander (related
  to the Japanese giant salamander and the American hellbender) in western China.
  The diversity of animal life is perhaps greatest in the ranges and valleys of Tibet
  and Sichuan, the latter province being renowned as the home of the giant panda.
  The takin (a type of goat antelope), numerous species of pheasants, and a variety
  of laughing thrushes are found in all Chinese mountain ranges. China seems to be
  one of the chief centres of dispersal of the carp family and also of old-world catfishes.The
  regional affinities of Chinese animal life are complex. Resemblances in the Northeast
  are to the fauna of the Siberian forests. Animals from Central Asia inhabit suitable
  steppe areas in northern China. The life of the great mountain ranges is Palearctic
  (relating to a biogeographic region that includes Europe, Asia north of the Himalayas,
  northern Arabia, and Africa north of the Sahara) but with distinctively Chinese
  species or genera. To the southeast the lowlands and mountains alike permit direct
  access to the eastern region. This part of China presents a complete transition
  from temperate-zone Palearctic life to the wealth of tropical forms distinctive
  of southeastern Asia. Tropical types of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals
  predominate in the southernmost Chinese provinces.1Statutory number; includes 36
