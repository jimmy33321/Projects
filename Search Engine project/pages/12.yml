  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- Indiana University has been recognized by the Indiana Commission for Higher Education for its commitment to 21st Century Scholars.
- |
  IU’s 21st Century Scholars program received the Champion Award, which recognizes outstanding K-12 or postsecondary schools, local community leaders or community partner organizations for their impact and contributions to the 21st Century Scholars program.
- |
  "This award recognizes the advocacy and support in place for scholars attending Indiana University and is possible because of IU's strong program commitment, broad campus partner support, and the dedication and commitment of 21st Century Scholars staff members," said Vincent Isom, director of IU’s 21st Century Scholars Program.
- |
  The Indiana Commission for Higher Education presented awards this year in honor of the 25th anniversary of the scholarship program. 
- |
  Created by the state of Indiana in 1990, the program helps low and middle-income Indiana families meet the cost of college. Income-eligible seventh- and eighth-graders who enroll in the program and fulfill a pledge of good citizenship are guaranteed to receive up to four years of undergraduate tuition at any participating public college or university in Indiana.
- |
  IU’s program, administered by the Office of the Vice President for Diversity, Equity and Multicultural Affairs, provides students with a wide array of support activities and services, including academic tutoring, peer mentoring, and workshops on financial aid and overseas study. IU’s 21st Century Scholarship Covenant program, started in 2007, provides additional funding for eligible 21st Century Scholars students to pay for books, room and board and other expenses
- |
  “The cost of college extends beyond tuition and fees, and for our state’s 21st Century Scholars, those additional costs can be a serious obstacle to completing a degree,” Indiana Commissioner for Higher Education Teresa Lubbers said. “Indiana University was the first college to offer supplemental support through its 21st Century Scholarship Covenant, and IU remains an important partner in the Scholar program’s success.”
- "“IU Bloomington boasts the highest 21st Century Scholars four-year and five-year
  graduation rates among Indiana public institutions,” said Martin McCrory, IU associate
  vice president for diversity, equity and multicultural affairs and IU Bloomington
  vice provost for diversity. “Being recognized with the Champion Award acknowledges
  the work that we do as ‘change-agents and difference-makers’ for our students during
  their educational pursuits.\"PrintShareFrom left, Precious McMillon, AmeriCorps

  for its commitment to 21st Century ScholarsIndiana University recognized for its
  commitment to 21st Century ScholarsDec. 4, 2015FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nBLOOMINGTON,
  Ind. -- Indiana University has been recognized by the Indiana Commission for Higher
  Education for its commitment to 21st Century Scholars.\nIU’s 21st Century Scholars
  program received the Champion Award, which recognizes outstanding K-12 or postsecondary
  schools, local community leaders or community partner organizations for their impact
  and contributions to the 21st Century Scholars program.\n\"This award recognizes
  the advocacy and support in place for scholars attending Indiana University and
  is possible because of IU's strong program commitment, broad campus partner support,
  and the dedication and commitment of 21st Century Scholars staff members,\" said
  Vincent Isom, director of IU’s 21st Century Scholars Program.\nThe Indiana Commission
  for Higher Education presented awards this year in honor of the 25th anniversary
  of the scholarship program. \nCreated by the state of Indiana in 1990, the program
  helps low and middle-income Indiana families meet the cost of college. Income-eligible
  seventh- and eighth-graders who enroll in the program and fulfill a pledge of good
  citizenship are guaranteed to receive up to four years of undergraduate tuition
  at any participating public college or university in Indiana.\nIU’s program, administered
  by the Office of the Vice President for Diversity, Equity and Multicultural Affairs,
  provides students with a wide array of support activities and services, including
  academic tutoring, peer mentoring, and workshops on financial aid and overseas study.
  IU’s 21st Century Scholarship Covenant program, started in 2007, provides additional
  funding for eligible 21st Century Scholars students to pay for books, room and board
  and other expenses\n“The cost of college extends beyond tuition and fees, and for
  our state’s 21st Century Scholars, those additional costs can be a serious obstacle
  to completing a degree,” Indiana Commissioner for Higher Education Teresa Lubbers
  said. “Indiana University was the first college to offer supplemental support through
  its 21st Century Scholarship Covenant, and IU remains an important partner in the
  Scholar program’s success.”\n“IU Bloomington boasts the highest 21st Century Scholars
  four-year and five-year graduation rates among Indiana public institutions,” said
  Martin McCrory, IU associate vice president for diversity, equity and multicultural
  affairs and IU Bloomington vice provost for diversity. “Being recognized with the
  Champion Award acknowledges the work that we do as ‘change-agents and difference-makers’
  for our students during their educational pursuits.\"PrintShareFrom left, Precious
