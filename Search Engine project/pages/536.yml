  heard by now, we've just announced that I have decided to step down as Chair, with
  the incredibly able Kelly Wallick now taking my place to lead the IGF into the future.

- "It's been just over 5 years since I first accepted the Chair position, and to say
  that the indie game landscape has changed enormously in that time is an over-obvious
  understatement. Simply in terms of numbers, the IGF receives well over twice the
  amount of entries as it did when I took on this role, as the number of both first-time
  developers and long-time veterans branching off on their own -- hoping to bring
  something into the world that only they can create -- has risen dramatically. \n"

  I'm very excited for the opportunity to continue Brandon's position as chairperson for the IGF.  When I first started the Indie MEGABOOTH more than four years ago, I couldn't imagine all the incredible opportunities it would provide me.  I've been able to work alongside so many wonderful companies and am continually learning and challenging not only myself, but the hundreds of developers I've had the privilege of working with over the years.  At the Indie MEGABOOTH, we're constantly evolving how to help support and grow the community along with fostering an atmosphere that encourages working together to affect the industry as a whole.

                                Proceedings are well underway for the jurying phase of the 2015 Independent Games Festival, in which discipline-specific experts play and discuss the merits of the nearly 650 games entered in the 2015 Festival Main Competition, all of which continue to push the boundaries of video game development and design.

  As in prior years, an extraordinary group of game development notables are evaluating IGF 2015's standout entries. Today we're happy to begin to announce members of some of these discipline-specific jury panels. After first-round IGF judging from more than 200 helpers, these panels -- composed of creators from studios both large and small -- will ultimately determine the finalists and winners of the various IGF 2015 awards at Game Developers Conference 2015.

                                Earlier today, one of our returning judges and jurors resigned from the festival following an extensive campaign from third parties regarding a tweet that was made some days ago -- claims about which we had already investigated and very quickly found to be made entirely in jest -- and we'd like to now offer an apology for and a clarification on our response.
- |2+

- |
  One of the reasons we invite hundreds of judges to take part in the first round of the IGF process is explicitly so that we can have a diversity of opinion from developers of games both large and small, academics, journalists, and other representatives of games culture at large. We believe that it's only through this diversity that the IGF can properly represent and celebrate the advancement and evolution of the medium, as more voices broaden the idea of what games can be.

                                You may have recently seen some odd claims of collusion between independent developers/funders & both the Independent Games Festival and Indiecade, most recently with untrue allegations that select independent developers have worked to 'fix' both award events.
- |2+

- |
  The IGF (and its parent company, which has looked into these claims) would like to assure all entrants and gamers that we take the idea of conflict of interest seriously in selecting our judging and jurying pools. Worries about the Independent Games Festival are nothing new (thanks to its perceived 'star-making' qualities), but for those who are unaware, we'll explain again how the process works.

  The explanation below is the process we've had in place since 2011, and, in the interest of transparency, it will be officially added to our FAQ in the coming days:

  Hi everyone, and welcome again to the 2015 Independent Games Festival, our 17th annual ceremony celebrating the best in independent games. As you read this post, we will have just begun accepting submissions for this year's festival, which will remain open until Wednesday, October 22nd for our Main Competition, and October 31st for our Student Competition.
- |2+

- |
  As usual, the festival will culminate with our awards show on Wednesday, March 4th, 2015,  during Game Developers Conference 2015, located at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.
- |2+

- |
  Typically, this is the bit of this blog post where I outline our changes to the festival, but after a few years of larger outward-facing policy shifts, this year we're holding steady with the same rules as 2014, and continuing to focus our enhancements on the backend that our entrants, judges and juries use, to make it easier than ever to submit, discover and rate the games we receive.
- |2+

- |
  Interested in being a judge in IGF 2015?
- |2+

- "With that said, we would like to extend the same invitation as we did late last
  year and open a call for new judges via this application form. We're always looking
  for more diverse voices to make up our judging body for both the Main and Student
  competition, and this form is your way of expressing your interest. \n"
- |2+

- |
  If you are involved in the games industry in any capacity and are not submitting a game to this year's festival, feel free to express your interest in becoming a judge by filling out this form. Please note that we can't guarantee all applications will be accepted -- if you've been selected, you'll receive an email from us when our judging process has begun.
- |2+

- "Now that submissions are officially open for IGF 2015, you can refer to our official
  rules for both the Main and Student Competitions in much greater detail. \n"
- |2+

- |
  If you have any questions about any of the detailed changes above, please don't hesitate to drop us an email at chairman@igf.com to discuss this further. Hope you're all having a great year, and we're all looking forward to seeing what you're all preparing for this year's Festival!

- "                     Hello all, and welcome back for what will be my final IGF
  update, as we once again open entries for the 2016 Festival. As you will have heard
  by now, we've just announced that I have decided to step down as Chair, with the
  incredibly able Kelly Wallick now taking my place to lead the IGF into the future.
  It's been just over 5 years since I first accepted the Chair position, and to say
  that the indie game landscape has changed enormously in that time is an over-obvious
  understatement. Simply in terms of numbers, the IGF receives well over twice the
  amount of entries as it did when I took on this role, as the number of both first-time
  developers and long-time veterans branching off on their own -- hoping to bring
  something into the world that only they can create -- has risen dramatically. \n"

  I'm very excited for the opportunity to continue Brandon's position as chairperson for the IGF.  When I first started the Indie MEGABOOTH more than four years ago, I couldn't imagine all the incredible opportunities it would provide me.  I've been able to work alongside so many wonderful companies and am continually learning and challenging not only myself, but the hundreds of developers I've had the privilege of working with over the years.  At the Indie MEGABOOTH, we're constantly evolving how to help support and grow the community along with fostering an atmosphere that encourages working together to affect the industry as a whole.

                                The Independent Games Festival is pleased to announce the winners for the ninth annual Student Showcase, which celebrates the brightest and most innovative creations to come out of universities and games programs from around the world in the past year, in advance of the 17th annual presentation of its prestigious awards.This year's showcase of top student talent include the fast-paced "five minutes or less" real-time strategy game Interloper from Dutch student development team Monogon Games, the stark, fast-paced falling action game Downwell from a student developer at Tokyo's University of the Arts, and strikingly topical arcade-style experience Rooftop Cop, a game from NYU Tisch School of the Arts student Stephen Lawrence Clark, which challenges people to play through a collection of five vignettes about a police force that has forgotten who they are meant to police -- and why.

                                Earlier today, one of our returning judges and jurors resigned from the festival following an extensive campaign from third parties regarding a tweet that was made some days ago -- claims about which we had already investigated and very quickly found to be made entirely in jest -- and we'd like to now offer an apology for and a clarification on our response.
- |2+

  One of the reasons we invite hundreds of judges to take part in the first round of the IGF process is explicitly so that we can have a diversity of opinion from developers of games both large and small, academics, journalists, and other representatives of games culture at large. We believe that it's only through this diversity that the IGF can properly represent and celebrate the advancement and evolution of the medium, as more voices broaden the idea of what games can be.

                                You may have recently seen some odd claims of collusion between independent developers/funders & both the Independent Games Festival and Indiecade, most recently with untrue allegations that select independent developers have worked to 'fix' both award events.

  The IGF (and its parent company, which has looked into these claims) would like to assure all entrants and gamers that we take the idea of conflict of interest seriously in selecting our judging and jurying pools. Worries about the Independent Games Festival are nothing new (thanks to its perceived 'star-making' qualities), but for those who are unaware, we'll explain again how the process works.

  The explanation below is the process we've had in place since 2011, and, in the interest of transparency, it will be officially added to our FAQ in the coming days:

  Hi everyone, and welcome again to the 2015 Independent Games Festival, our 17th annual ceremony celebrating the best in independent games. As you read this post, we will have just begun accepting submissions for this year's festival, which will remain open until Wednesday, October 22nd for our Main Competition, and October 31st for our Student Competition.
- |2+

- |
  As usual, the festival will culminate with our awards show on Wednesday, March 4th, 2015,  during Game Developers Conference 2015, located at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.
- |2+

- |
  Typically, this is the bit of this blog post where I outline our changes to the festival, but after a few years of larger outward-facing policy shifts, this year we're holding steady with the same rules as 2014, and continuing to focus our enhancements on the backend that our entrants, judges and juries use, to make it easier than ever to submit, discover and rate the games we receive.
- |2+

- |
  Interested in being a judge in IGF 2015?

  year and open a call for new judges via this application form. We're always looking
  for more diverse voices to make up our judging body for both the Main and Student
  competition, and this form is your way of expressing your interest. \n"
- |2+

  If you are involved in the games industry in any capacity and are not submitting a game to this year's festival, feel free to express your interest in becoming a judge by filling out this form. Please note that we can't guarantee all applications will be accepted -- if you've been selected, you'll receive an email from us when our judging process has begun.

  rules for both the Main and Student Competitions in much greater detail. \n"

                       First off, I'd like to thank Brandon Boyer for his years of hard work with the Independent Games Festival and his contribution to the indie games community - here's his goodbye note to you all. The full, official announcement post for the 2016 Independent Games Festival is available here.I'm very excited for the opportunity to continue Brandon's position as chairperson for the IGF.  When I first started the Indie MEGABOOTH more than four years ago, I couldn't imagine all the incredible opportunities it would provide me.  I've been able to work alongside so many wonderful companies and am continually learning and challenging not only myself, but the hundreds of developers I've had the privilege of working with over the years.  At the Indie MEGABOOTH, we're constantly evolving how to help support and grow the community along with fostering an atmosphere that encourages working together to affect the industry as a whole.

Together with the Main Competition submissions, this year's IGF has taken in over 1,000 entries total -- once again surpassing the festival's record across the Main and Student Competitions.

                                Earlier today, one of our returning judges and jurors resigned from the festival following an extensive campaign from third parties regarding a tweet that was made some days ago -- claims about which we had already investigated and very quickly found to be made entirely in jest -- and we'd like to now offer an apology for and a clarification on our response.One of the reasons we invite hundreds of judges to take part in the first round of the IGF process is explicitly so that we can have a diversity of opinion from developers of games both large and small, academics, journalists, and other representatives of games culture at large. We believe that it's only through this diversity that the IGF can properly represent and celebrate the advancement and evolution of the medium, as more voices broaden the idea of what games can be.

Worries about the Independent Games Festival are nothing new (thanks to its perceived 'star-making' qualities), but for those who are unaware, we'll explain again how the process works.The explanation below is the process we've had in place since 2011, and, in the interest of transparency, it will be officially added to our FAQ in the coming days:

                                Hi everyone, and welcome again to the 2015 Independent Games Festival, our 17th annual ceremony celebrating the best in independent games. As you read this post, we will have just begun accepting submissions for this year's festival, which will remain open until Wednesday, October 22nd for our Main Competition, and October 31st for our Student Competition.As usual, the festival will culminate with our awards show on Wednesday, March 4th, 2015,  during Game Developers Conference 2015, located at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.Typically, this is the bit of this blog post where I outline our changes to the festival, but after a few years of larger outward-facing policy shifts, this year we're holding steady with the same rules as 2014, and continuing to focus our enhancements on the backend that our entrants, judges and juries use, to make it easier than ever to submit, discover and rate the games we receive.Interested in being a judge in IGF 2015?With that said, we would like to extend the same invitation as we did late last year and open a call for new judges via this application form. We're always looking for more diverse voices to make up our judging body for both the Main and Student competition, and this form is your way of expressing your interest. If you are involved in the games industry in any capacity and are not submitting a game to this year's festival, feel free to express your interest in becoming a judge by filling out this form. Please note that we can't guarantee all applications will be accepted -- if you've been selected, you'll receive an email from us when our judging process has begun.Now that submissions are officially open for IGF 2015, you can refer to our official rules for both the Main and Student Competitions in much greater detail. If you have any questions about any of the detailed changes above, please don't hesitate to drop us an email at chairman@igf.com to discuss this further. Hope you're all having a great year, and we're all looking forward to seeing what you're all preparing for this year's Festival!

  all, and welcome back for what will be my final IGF update, as we once again open
  entries for the 2016 Festival. As you will have heard by now, we've just announced
  that I have decided to step down as Chair, with the incredibly able Kelly Wallick
  now taking my place to lead the IGF into the future. \n\nIt's been just over 5 years
  since I first accepted the Chair position, and to say that the indie game landscape
  has changed enormously in that time is an over-obvious understatement. Simply in
  terms of numbers, the IGF receives well over twice the amount of entries as it did
  when I took on this role, as the number of both first-time developers and long-time
  veterans branching off on their own -- hoping to bring something into the world
  that only they can create -- has risen dramatically. \n                              \n

  \                          \n                              First off, I'd like to
  thank Brandon Boyer for his years of hard work with the Independent Games Festival
  and his contribution to the indie games community - here's his goodbye note to you
  all. The full, official announcement post for the 2016 Independent Games Festival
  is available here.\n\nI'm very excited for the opportunity to continue Brandon's
  position as chairperson for the IGF.  When I first started the Indie MEGABOOTH more
  than four years ago, I couldn't imagine all the incredible opportunities it would
  provide me.  I've been able to work alongside so many wonderful companies and am
  continually learning and challenging not only myself, but the hundreds of developers
  I've had the privilege of working with over the years.  At the Indie MEGABOOTH,
  we're constantly evolving how to help support and grow the community along with
  fostering an atmosphere that encourages working together to affect the industry
  as a whole.\n                              \n                              \n                                 Continue

  in independent video games. The IGF has nominated over 30 extraordinary game titles
  released in the past year.\nCandidates for the 2015 IGF Awards were distributed
  to a group of esteemed evaluators from across the industry for evaluation. Expert
  juries specializing in distinct disciplines for each category then selected the
  IGF finalists following playthroughs and recommendations from the nearly 650 IGF
  Main Competition entrants.\nThis year's finalists are led by various standout titles
  nominated for multiple awards, including inkle's globe-trotting interactive fiction
  game 80 Days, Croteam's philosophical first-person puzzle game The Talos Principle and
  the brutally earnest wartime survival simulator This War Of Mine from 11 Bit Studios.\n

  we're happy to begin to announce members of some of these discipline-specific jury
  panels. After first-round IGF judging from more than 200 helpers, these panels --

  longest-running and largest independent games festival worldwide -- is months away,
  and today officials are proud to announce another year of record entries for IGF
  2015's Student Competition.\n\nThis year's Student Competition, which will display
  finalists and show winners at Game Developers Conference 2015 in March, took in
  over 360 game entries across all platforms -- console, PC and mobile -- from a broad
  array of the world's most prestigious universities, games programs, and high schools.
  \n\nTogether with the Main Competition submissions, this year's IGF has taken in
  over 1,000 entries total -- once again surpassing the festival's record across the
  Main and Student Competitions.\n                              \n                              \n

  our returning judges and jurors resigned from the festival following an extensive
  campaign from third parties regarding a tweet that was made some days ago -- claims
  about which we had already investigated and very quickly found to be made entirely
  in jest -- and we'd like to now offer an apology for and a clarification on our
  response.\n\nOne of the reasons we invite hundreds of judges to take part in the
  first round of the IGF process is explicitly so that we can have a diversity of
  opinion from developers of games both large and small, academics, journalists, and
  other representatives of games culture at large. We believe that it's only through
  this diversity that the IGF can properly represent and celebrate the advancement
  and evolution of the medium, as more voices broaden the idea of what games can be.\n

  may have recently seen some odd claims of collusion between independent developers/funders

  that select independent developers have worked to 'fix' both award events.\n\nThe
  IGF (and its parent company, which has looked into these claims) would like to assure
  all entrants and gamers that we take the idea of conflict of interest seriously
  in selecting our judging and jurying pools. Worries about the Independent Games
  Festival are nothing new (thanks to its perceived 'star-making' qualities), but
  for those who are unaware, we'll explain again how the process works.\n\nThe explanation
  below is the process we've had in place since 2011, and, in the interest of transparency,
  it will be officially added to our FAQ in the coming days:\n                              \n

  March. This directly follows a record-breaking year which saw nearly 900 entries
  for the 2014 event, including top prizewinners like Papers, Please, Luxuria Superbia
  and DEVICE 6. \n\nThe deadlines for the Main and Student Showcase categories for
  the 17th IGF are October 22th and October 31st, 2014 respectively, with finalists
  announced in January 2015. Finalists' games will once again be playable at the packed
  IGF Pavilion on the Game Developers Conference 2015 Expo Floor, and will compete
  for over $50,000 in prizes. \n                              \n                              \n

  \                          \n                              \n\nHi everyone, and
  welcome again to the 2015 Independent Games Festival, our 17th annual ceremony celebrating
  the best in independent games. As you read this post, we will have just begun accepting
  submissions for this year's festival, which will remain open until Wednesday, October
  22nd for our Main Competition, and October 31st for our Student Competition.\n\nAs
  usual, the festival will culminate with our awards show on Wednesday, March 4th,
  2015,  during Game Developers Conference 2015, located at the Moscone Center in
  San Francisco.\n\nTypically, this is the bit of this blog post where I outline our
  changes to the festival, but after a few years of larger outward-facing policy shifts,
  this year we're holding steady with the same rules as 2014, and continuing to focus
  our enhancements on the backend that our entrants, judges and juries use, to make
  it easier than ever to submit, discover and rate the games we receive.\n\nInterested
  in being a judge in IGF 2015?\n\nWith that said, we would like to extend the same
  invitation as we did late last year and open a call for new judges via this application
  form. We're always looking for more diverse voices to make up our judging body for
  both the Main and Student competition, and this form is your way of expressing your
  interest. \n\nIf you are involved in the games industry in any capacity and are
  not submitting a game to this year's festival, feel free to express your interest
  in becoming a judge by filling out this form. Please note that we can't guarantee
  all applications will be accepted -- if you've been selected, you'll receive an
  email from us when our judging process has begun.\n\nNow that submissions are officially
  open for IGF 2015, you can refer to our official rules for both the Main and Student
  Competitions in much greater detail. \n\nIf you have any questions about any of
  the detailed changes above, please don't hesitate to drop us an email at chairman@igf.com
  to discuss this further. Hope you're all having a great year, and we're all looking
  forward to seeing what you're all preparing for this year's Festival!\n                              \n

  opportunity to buy the now sold-out IGS pass. \n\nBy doing so they agree to volunteer
  on an onsite project just before GDC 2014, with 100 percent of their Indie Giving
  package price going directly to the Hands On Bay Area nonprofit and its partners.\n

  \                    Hello all, and welcome back for what will be my final IGF update,
  as we once again open entries for the 2016 Festival. As you will have heard by now,
  we've just announced that I have decided to step down as Chair, with the incredibly
  able Kelly Wallick now taking my place to lead the IGF into the future. It's been
  just over 5 years since I first accepted the Chair position, and to say that the
  indie game landscape has changed enormously in that time is an over-obvious understatement.
  Simply in terms of numbers, the IGF receives well over twice the amount of entries
  as it did when I took on this role, as the number of both first-time developers
  and long-time veterans branching off on their own -- hoping to bring something into

  \                          \n                              First off, I'd like to
  thank Brandon Boyer for his years of hard work with the Independent Games Festival
  and his contribution to the indie games community - here's his goodbye note to you
  all. The full, official announcement post for the 2016 Independent Games Festival
  is available here.\n\nI'm very excited for the opportunity to continue Brandon's
  position as chairperson for the IGF.  When I first started the Indie MEGABOOTH more
  than four years ago, I couldn't imagine all the incredible opportunities it would
  provide me.  I've been able to work alongside so many wonderful companies and am
  continually learning and challenging not only myself, but the hundreds of developers
  I've had the privilege of working with over the years.  At the Indie MEGABOOTH,
  we're constantly evolving how to help support and grow the community along with
  fostering an atmosphere that encourages working together to affect the industry
  as a whole.\n                              \n                              \n                                 Continue

  in independent video games. The IGF has nominated over 30 extraordinary game titles
  released in the past year.\nCandidates for the 2015 IGF Awards were distributed
  to a group of esteemed evaluators from across the industry for evaluation. Expert
  juries specializing in distinct disciplines for each category then selected the
  IGF finalists following playthroughs and recommendations from the nearly 650 IGF
  Main Competition entrants.\nThis year's finalists are led by various standout titles
  nominated for multiple awards, including inkle's globe-trotting interactive fiction
  game 80 Days, Croteam's philosophical first-person puzzle game The Talos Principle and
  the brutally earnest wartime survival simulator This War Of Mine from 11 Bit Studios.\n

  and today officials are proud to announce another year of record entries for IGF
  2015's Student Competition.\n\nThis year's Student Competition, which will display
  finalists and show winners at Game Developers Conference 2015 in March, took in
  over 360 game entries across all platforms -- console, PC and mobile -- from a broad
  array of the world's most prestigious universities, games programs, and high schools.

  our returning judges and jurors resigned from the festival following an extensive
  campaign from third parties regarding a tweet that was made some days ago -- claims
  about which we had already investigated and very quickly found to be made entirely
  in jest -- and we'd like to now offer an apology for and a clarification on our
  response.\n\nOne of the reasons we invite hundreds of judges to take part in the
  first round of the IGF process is explicitly so that we can have a diversity of
  opinion from developers of games both large and small, academics, journalists, and
  other representatives of games culture at large. We believe that it's only through
  this diversity that the IGF can properly represent and celebrate the advancement
  and evolution of the medium, as more voices broaden the idea of what games can be.\n

  may have recently seen some odd claims of collusion between independent developers/funders
  & both the Independent Games Festival and Indiecade, most recently with untrue allegations
  that select independent developers have worked to 'fix' both award events.\n\nThe
  IGF (and its parent company, which has looked into these claims) would like to assure
  all entrants and gamers that we take the idea of conflict of interest seriously
  in selecting our judging and jurying pools. Worries about the Independent Games
  Festival are nothing new (thanks to its perceived 'star-making' qualities), but
  for those who are unaware, we'll explain again how the process works.\n\nThe explanation
  below is the process we've had in place since 2011, and, in the interest of transparency,
  it will be officially added to our FAQ in the coming days:\n                              \n

  March. This directly follows a record-breaking year which saw nearly 900 entries
  for the 2014 event, including top prizewinners like Papers, Please, Luxuria Superbia
  and DEVICE 6. \n\nThe deadlines for the Main and Student Showcase categories for
  the 17th IGF are October 22th and October 31st, 2014 respectively, with finalists

  welcome again to the 2015 Independent Games Festival, our 17th annual ceremony celebrating
  the best in independent games. As you read this post, we will have just begun accepting
  submissions for this year's festival, which will remain open until Wednesday, October
  22nd for our Main Competition, and October 31st for our Student Competition.\n\nAs
  usual, the festival will culminate with our awards show on Wednesday, March 4th,
  2015,  during Game Developers Conference 2015, located at the Moscone Center in
  San Francisco.\n\nTypically, this is the bit of this blog post where I outline our
  changes to the festival, but after a few years of larger outward-facing policy shifts,
  this year we're holding steady with the same rules as 2014, and continuing to focus
  our enhancements on the backend that our entrants, judges and juries use, to make
  it easier than ever to submit, discover and rate the games we receive.\n\nInterested
  in being a judge in IGF 2015?\n\nWith that said, we would like to extend the same
  invitation as we did late last year and open a call for new judges via this application
  form. We're always looking for more diverse voices to make up our judging body for
  both the Main and Student competition, and this form is your way of expressing your
  interest. \n\nIf you are involved in the games industry in any capacity and are
  not submitting a game to this year's festival, feel free to express your interest
  in becoming a judge by filling out this form. Please note that we can't guarantee
  all applications will be accepted -- if you've been selected, you'll receive an
  email from us when our judging process has begun.\n\nNow that submissions are officially
  open for IGF 2015, you can refer to our official rules for both the Main and Student
  Competitions in much greater detail. \n\nIf you have any questions about any of
  the detailed changes above, please don't hesitate to drop us an email at chairman@igf.com
  to discuss this further. Hope you're all having a great year, and we're all looking
  forward to seeing what you're all preparing for this year's Festival!\n                              \n

  so that we can have a diversity of opinion from developers of games both large and
  small, academics, journalists, and other representatives of games culture at large.

  may have recently seen some odd claims of collusion between independent developers/funders
  & both the Independent Games Festival and Indiecade, most recently with untrue allegations
  that select independent developers have worked to 'fix' both award events.The IGF
  (and its parent company, which has looked into these claims) would like to assure
  all entrants and gamers that we take the idea of conflict of interest seriously
  in selecting our judging and jurying pools. Worries about the Independent Games
  Festival are nothing new (thanks to its perceived 'star-making' qualities), but
  for those who are unaware, we'll explain again how the process works.The explanation
  below is the process we've had in place since 2011, and, in the interest of transparency,
  it will be officially added to our FAQ in the coming days:\n                                 Continue

  are now officially open for the 2015 Independent Games Festival, the signature competition
  for indie games, to be held for a 17th year during GDC 2015 in San Francisco next

  over $50,000 in prizes. \n                                 Continue reading \"2015
  Independent Games Festival opens call for submissions\" »\n                              Hi
  everyone, and welcome again to the 2015 Independent Games Festival, our 17th annual
  ceremony celebrating the best in independent games. As you read this post, we will
  have just begun accepting submissions for this year's festival, which will remain
  open until Wednesday, October 22nd for our Main Competition, and October 31st for
  our Student Competition.As usual, the festival will culminate with our awards show
  on Wednesday, March 4th, 2015,  during Game Developers Conference 2015, located
  at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.Typically, this is the bit of this blog post
  where I outline our changes to the festival, but after a few years of larger outward-facing
  policy shifts, this year we're holding steady with the same rules as 2014, and continuing
  to focus our enhancements on the backend that our entrants, judges and juries use,
  to make it easier than ever to submit, discover and rate the games we receive.Interested
  in being a judge in IGF 2015?With that said, we would like to extend the same invitation
  as we did late last year and open a call for new judges via this application form.
  We're always looking for more diverse voices to make up our judging body for both
  the Main and Student competition, and this form is your way of expressing your interest.
  If you are involved in the games industry in any capacity and are not submitting
  a game to this year's festival, feel free to express your interest in becoming a
  judge by filling out this form. Please note that we can't guarantee all applications
  will be accepted -- if you've been selected, you'll receive an email from us when
  our judging process has begun.Now that submissions are officially open for IGF 2015,
  you can refer to our official rules for both the Main and Student Competitions in
  much greater detail. If you have any questions about any of the detailed changes
  above, please don't hesitate to drop us an email at chairman@igf.com to discuss
  this further. Hope you're all having a great year, and we're all looking forward
  to seeing what you're all preparing for this year's Festival! The Independent Games
  Festival China - which will take place this October alongside GDC China in Shanghai
  - has opened its call for submissions and is accepting indie game entries from the
  pan-Pacific area from now through July 25.GDC China will once again host all three
  main elements of IGF China, including the Independent Games Summit, the IGF Pavilion,
  and the prestigious IGF China Awards.Now in its sixth year, the IGF Summit at GDC
  China will feature sessions from some of the world's top developers, while the IGF
  Pavilion will showcase some of the region's best independent and student games.\n
