  A computer is a general-purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.
- |
  Conventionally, a computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU), and some form of memory. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logic operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source, and the result of operations saved and retrieved.
- |
  Mechanical analog computers started appearing in the first century and were later used in the medieval era for astronomical calculations. In World War II, mechanical analog computers were used for specialized military applications such as calculating torpedo aiming. During this time the first electronic digital computers were developed. Originally they were the size of a large room, consuming as much power as several hundred modern personal computers (PCs).[1]
- |
  Modern computers based on integrated circuits are millions to billions of times more capable than the early machines, and occupy a fraction of the space.[2] Computers are small enough to fit into mobile devices, and mobile computers can be powered by small batteries. Personal computers in their various forms are icons of the Information Age and are generally considered as "computers". However, the embedded computers found in many devices from MP3 players to fighter aircraft and from electronic toys to industrial robots are the most numerous.

  Etymology
- |
  The first known use of the word "computer" was in 1613 in a book called The Yong Mans Gleanings by English writer Richard Braithwait: "I haue read the truest computer of Times, and the best Arithmetician that euer breathed, and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number." It referred to a person who carried out calculations, or computations. The word continued with the same meaning until the middle of the 20th century. From the end of the 19th century the word began to take on its more familiar meaning, a machine that carries out computations.[3]

  Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, mostly using one-to-one correspondence with fingers. The earliest counting device was probably a form of tally stick. Later record keeping aids throughout the Fertile Crescent included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers.[4][5] The use of counting rods is one example.

  The abacus was initially used for arithmetic tasks. The Roman abacus was used in Babylonia as early as 2400 BC. Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented. In a medieval European counting house, a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money.

  The ancient Greek-designed Antikythera mechanism, dating between 150 to 100 BC, is the world's oldest analog computer.

- |
  The Antikythera mechanism is believed to be the earliest mechanical analog "computer", according to Derek J. de Solla Price.[6] It was designed to calculate astronomical positions. It was discovered in 1901 in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, between Kythera and Crete, and has been dated to circa 100 BC. Devices of a level of complexity comparable to that of the Antikythera mechanism would not reappear until a thousand years later.

  Many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use. The planisphere was a star chart invented by Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī in the early 11th century.[7] The astrolabe was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and is often attributed to Hipparchus. A combination of the planisphere and dioptra, the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy. An astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer[8][9] and gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan, Persia in 1235.[10]Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe,[11] an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine[12] with a gear train and gear-wheels,[13]circa 1000 AD.

  The slide rule was invented around 1620–1630, shortly after the publication of the concept of the logarithm. It is a hand-operated analog computer for doing multiplication and division. As slide rule development progressed, added scales provided reciprocals, squares and square roots, cubes and cube roots, as well as transcendental functions such as logarithms and exponentials, circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other functions. Aviation is one of the few fields where slide rules are still in widespread use, particularly for solving time–distance problems in light aircraft. To save space and for ease of reading, these are typically circular devices rather than the classic linear slide rule shape. A popular example is the E6B.

  In the 1770s Pierre Jaquet-Droz, a Swiss watchmaker, built a mechanical doll (automata) that could write holding a quill pen. By switching the number and order of its internal wheels different letters, and hence different messages, could be produced. In effect, it could be mechanically "programmed" to read instructions. Along with two other complex machines, the doll is at the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire of Neuchâtel, Switzerland, and still operates.[14]

  The tide-predicting machine invented by Sir William Thomson in 1872 was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters. It used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location.

  The differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration, used wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration. In 1876 Lord Kelvin had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators, but he had been stymied by the limited output torque of the ball-and-disk integrators.[15] In a differential analyzer, the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output. The torque amplifier was the advance that allowed these machines to work. Starting in the 1920s, Vannevar Bush and others developed mechanical differential analyzers.

  Charles Babbage, an English mechanical engineer and polymath, originated the concept of a programmable computer. Considered the "father of the computer",[16] he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the early 19th century. After working on his revolutionary difference engine, designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more general design, an Analytical Engine, was possible. The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete.[17][18]
- |
  The machine was about a century ahead of its time. All the parts for his machine had to be made by hand — this was a major problem for a device with thousands of parts. Eventually, the project was dissolved with the decision of the British Government to cease funding. Babbage's failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to difficulties not only of politics and financing, but also to his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow. Nevertheless, his son, Henry Babbage, completed a simplified version of the analytical engine's computing unit (the mill) in 1888. He gave a successful demonstration of its use in computing tables in 1906.

  Sir William Thomson's third tide-predicting machine design, 1879–81
- |2+

  During the first half of the 20th century, many scientific computing needs were met by increasingly sophisticated analog computers, which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a basis for computation. However, these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers.[19]
- |
  The first modern analog computer was a tide-predicting machine, invented by Sir William Thomson in 1872. The differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration using wheel-and-disc mechanisms, was conceptualized in 1876 by James Thomson, the brother of the more famous Lord Kelvin.[15]
- |
  The art of mechanical analog computing reached its zenith with the differential analyzer, built by H. L. Hazen and Vannevar Bush at MIT starting in 1927. This built on the mechanical integrators of James Thomson and the torque amplifiers invented by H. W. Nieman. A dozen of these devices were built before their obsolescence became obvious.

  By the 1950s the success of digital electronic computers had spelled the end for most analog computing machines, but analog computers remain in use in some specialized applications such as education (control systems) and aircraft (slide rule).

  Digital computer development
- |
  The principle of the modern computer was first described by mathematician and pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing, who set out the idea in his seminal 1936 paper,[20]On Computable Numbers. Turing reformulated Kurt Gödel's 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. He proved that some such machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the Entscheidungsproblem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable: in general, it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a given Turing machine will ever halt.
- |
  He also introduced the notion of a 'Universal Machine' (now known as a Universal Turing machine), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other machine, or in other words, it is provably capable of computing anything that is computable by executing a program stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable. Von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper.[21] Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in theory of computation. Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores, modern computers are said to be Turing-complete, which is to say, they have algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal Turing machine.

  Electromechanical

  By 1938 the United States Navy had developed an electromechanical analog computer small enough to use aboard a submarine. This was the Torpedo Data Computer, which used trigonometry to solve the problem of firing a torpedo at a moving target. During World War II similar devices were developed in other countries as well.

  Early digital computers were electromechanical; electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation. These devices had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers, originally using vacuum tubes. The Z2, created by German engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939, was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer.[22]
- |
  In 1941, Zuse followed his earlier machine up with the Z3, the world's first working electromechanical programmable, fully automatic digital computer.[23][24] The Z3 was built with 2000 relays, implementing a 22 bit word length that operated at a clock frequency of about 5–10 Hz.[25] Program code was supplied on punched film while data could be stored in 64 words of memory or supplied from the keyboard. It was quite similar to modern machines in some respects, pioneering numerous advances such as floating point numbers. Replacement of the hard-to-implement decimal system (used in Charles Babbage's earlier design) by the simpler binary system meant that Zuse's machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable, given the technologies available at that time.[26] The Z3 was Turing complete.[27][28]

  Vacuum tubes and digital electronic circuits
- |
  Purely electronic circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents, at the same time that digital calculation replaced analog. The engineer Tommy Flowers, working at the Post Office Research Station in London in the 1930s, began to explore the possible use of electronics for the telephone exchange. Experimental equipment that he built in 1934 went into operation 5 years later, converting a portion of the telephone exchange network into an electronic data processing system, using thousands of vacuum tubes.[19] In the US, John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford E. Berry of Iowa State University developed and tested the Atanasoff–Berry Computer (ABC) in 1942,[29] the first "automatic electronic digital computer".[30] This design was also all-electronic and used about 300 vacuum tubes, with capacitors fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for memory.[31]

  During World War II, the British at Bletchley Park achieved a number of successes at breaking encrypted German military communications. The German encryption machine, Enigma, was first attacked with the help of the electro-mechanical bombes. To crack the more sophisticated German Lorenz SZ 40/42 machine, used for high-level Army communications, Max Newman and his colleagues commissioned Flowers to build the Colossus.[31] He spent eleven months from early February 1943 designing and building the first Colossus.[32] After a functional test in December 1943, Colossus was shipped to Bletchley Park, where it was delivered on 18 January 1944[33] and attacked its first message on 5 February.[31]
- |
  Colossus was the world's first electronic digital programmable computer.[19] It used a large number of valves (vacuum tubes). It had paper-tape input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of boolean logical operations on its data, but it was not Turing-complete. Nine Mk II Colossi were built (The Mk I was converted to a Mk II making ten machines in total). Colossus Mark I contained 1500 thermionic valves (tubes), but Mark II with 2400 valves, was both 5 times faster and simpler to operate than Mark 1, greatly speeding the decoding process.[34][35]

  ENIAC was the first Turing-complete device, and performed ballistics trajectory calculations for the United States Army.

  The US-built ENIAC[36] (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first electronic programmable computer built in the US. Although the ENIAC was similar to the Colossus it was much faster and more flexible. It was unambiguously a Turing-complete device and could compute any problem that would fit into its memory. Like the Colossus, a "program" on the ENIAC was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches, a far cry from the stored program electronic machines that came later. Once a program was written, it had to be mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting of plugs and switches.
- |
  It combined the high speed of electronics with the ability to be programmed for many complex problems. It could add or subtract 5000 times a second, a thousand times faster than any other machine. It also had modules to multiply, divide, and square root. High speed memory was limited to 20 words (about 80 bytes). Built under the direction of John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert at the University of Pennsylvania, ENIAC's development and construction lasted from 1943 to full operation at the end of 1945. The machine was huge, weighing 30 tons, using 200 kilowatts of electric power and contained over 18,000 vacuum tubes, 1,500 relays, and hundreds of thousands of resistors, capacitors, and inductors.[37]

  Early computing machines had fixed programs. Changing its function required the re-wiring and re-structuring of the machine.[31] With the proposal of the stored-program computer this changed. A stored-program computer includes by design an instruction set and can store in memory a set of instructions (a program) that details the computation. The theoretical basis for the stored-program computer was laid by Alan Turing in his 1936 paper. In 1945 Turing joined the National Physical Laboratory and began work on developing an electronic stored-program digital computer. His 1945 report ‘Proposed Electronic Calculator’ was the first specification for such a device. John von Neumann at the University of Pennsylvania, also circulated his First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC in 1945.[19]

  The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine, nicknamed Baby, was the world's first stored-program computer. It was built at the Victoria University of Manchester by Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill, and ran its first program on 21 June 1948.[38] It was designed as a testbed for the Williams tube the first random-access digital storage device.[39] Although the computer was considered "small and primitive" by the standards of its time, it was the first working machine to contain all of the elements essential to a modern electronic computer.[40] As soon as the SSEM had demonstrated the feasibility of its design, a project was initiated at the university to develop it into a more usable computer, the Manchester Mark 1.
- |
  The Mark 1 in turn quickly became the prototype for the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer.[41] Built by Ferranti, it was delivered to the University of Manchester in February 1951. At least seven of these later machines were delivered between 1953 and 1957, one of them to Shell labs in Amsterdam.[42] In October 1947, the directors of British catering company J. Lyons & Company decided to take an active role in promoting the commercial development of computers. The LEO I computer became operational in April 1951 [43] and ran the world's first regular routine office computer job.

  The bipolar transistor was invented in 1947. From 1955 onwards transistors replaced vacuum tubes in computer designs, giving rise to the "second generation" of computers. Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors have many advantages: they are smaller, and require less power than vacuum tubes, so give off less heat. Silicon junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer, indefinite, service life. Transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space.
- |
  At the University of Manchester, a team under the leadership of Tom Kilburn designed and built a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves.[44] Their first transistorised computer and the first in the world, was operational by 1953, and a second version was completed there in April 1955. However, the machine did make use of valves to generate its 125 kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic drum memory, so it was not the first completely transistorized computer. That distinction goes to the Harwell CADET of 1955,[45] built by the electronics division of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell.[46][47]

  Integrated circuits
- |
  The next great advance in computing power came with the advent of the integrated circuit. The idea of the integrated circuit was first conceived by a radar scientist working for the Royal Radar Establishment of the Ministry of Defence, Geoffrey W.A. Dummer. Dummer presented the first public description of an integrated circuit at the Symposium on Progress in Quality Electronic Components in Washington, D.C. on 7 May 1952.[48]
- |
  The first practical ICs were invented by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor.[49] Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in July 1958, successfully demonstrating the first working integrated example on 12 September 1958.[50] In his patent application of 6 February 1959, Kilby described his new device as "a body of semiconductor material ... wherein all the components of the electronic circuit are completely integrated".[51][52] Noyce also came up with his own idea of an integrated circuit half a year later than Kilby.[53] His chip solved many practical problems that Kilby's had not. Produced at Fairchild Semiconductor, it was made of silicon, whereas Kilby's chip was made of germanium.

  This new development heralded an explosion in the commercial and personal use of computers and led to the invention of the microprocessor. While the subject of exactly which device was the first microprocessor is contentious, partly due to lack of agreement on the exact definition of the term "microprocessor", it is largely undisputed that the first single-chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004,[54] designed and realized by Ted Hoff, Federico Faggin, and Stanley Mazor at Intel.[55]

  Mobile computers become dominant
- |
  With the continued miniaturization of computing resources, and advancements in portable battery life, portable computers grew in popularity in the 2000s.[56] The same developments that spurred the growth of laptop computers and other portable computers allowed manufacturers to integrate computing resources into cellular phones. These so-called smartphones and tablets run on a variety of operating systems and have become the dominant computing device on the market, with manufacturers reporting having shipped an estimated 237 million devices in 2Q 2013.[57]

  Programs
- |
  The defining feature of modern computers which distinguishes them from all other machines is that they can be programmed. That is to say that some type of instructions (the program) can be given to the computer, and it will process them. Modern computers based on the von Neumann architecture often have machine code in the form of an imperative programming language.
- |
  In practical terms, a computer program may be just a few instructions or extend to many millions of instructions, as do the programs for word processors and web browsers for example. A typical modern computer can execute billions of instructions per second (gigaflops) and rarely makes a mistake over many years of operation. Large computer programs consisting of several million instructions may take teams of programmers years to write, and due to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors.

  In most cases, computer instructions are simple: add one number to another, move some data from one location to another, send a message to some external device, etc. These instructions are read from the computer's memory and are generally carried out (executed) in the order they were given. However, there are usually specialized instructions to tell the computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in the program and to carry on executing from there. These are called "jump" instructions (or branches). Furthermore, jump instructions may be made to happen conditionally so that different sequences of instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation or some external event. Many computers directly support subroutines by providing a type of jump that "remembers" the location it jumped from and another instruction to return to the instruction following that jump instruction.
- |
  Program execution might be likened to reading a book. While a person will normally read each word and line in sequence, they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest. Similarly, a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again until some internal condition is met. This is called the flow of control within the program and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention.

  Comparatively, a person using a pocket calculator can perform a basic arithmetic operation such as adding two numbers with just a few button presses. But to add together all of the numbers from 1 to 1,000 would take thousands of button presses and a lot of time, with a near certainty of making a mistake. On the other hand, a computer may be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions. The following example is written in the MIPS assembly language:
- |2+

- |2+

- |2+

- |2
    begin:
- |2
    addi $8, $0, 0           # initialize sum to 0
- |2
    addi $9, $0, 1           # set first number to add = 1
- |2
    loop:
- |2
    slti $10, $9, 1000       # check if the number is less than 1000
- |2
    beq $10, $0, finish      # if odd number is greater than n then exit
- |2
    add $8, $8, $9           # update sum
- |2
    addi $9, $9, 1           # get next number
- |2
    j loop                   # repeat the summing process
- |2
    finish:
- |2
    add $2, $8, $0           # put sum in output register
- |2+

- |
  Once told to run this program, the computer will perform the repetitive addition task without further human intervention. It will almost never make a mistake and a modern PC can complete the task in a fraction of a second.
- |
  Machine code
- |
  In most computers, individual instructions are stored as machine code with each instruction being given a unique number (its operation code or opcode for short). The command to add two numbers together would have one opcode; the command to multiply them would have a different opcode, and so on. The simplest computers are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions; the more complex computers have several hundred to choose from, each with a unique numerical code. Since the computer's memory is able to store numbers, it can also store the instruction codes. This leads to the important fact that entire programs (which are just lists of these instructions) can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside the computer in the same way as numeric data. The fundamental concept of storing programs in the computer's memory alongside the data they operate on is the crux of the von Neumann, or stored program[citation needed], architecture. In some cases, a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that is kept separate from the data it operates on. This is called the Harvard architecture after the Harvard Mark I computer. Modern von Neumann computers display some traits of the Harvard architecture in their designs, such as in CPU caches.

  While it is possible to write computer programs as long lists of numbers (machine language) and while this technique was used with many early computers,[58] it is extremely tedious and potentially error-prone to do so in practice, especially for complicated programs. Instead, each basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative of its function and easy to remember – a mnemonic such as ADD, SUB, MULT or JUMP. These mnemonics are collectively known as a computer's assembly language. Converting programs written in assembly language into something the computer can actually understand (machine language) is usually done by a computer program called an assembler.

  Programming language

  Main article: Programming language
- |
  Programming languages provide various ways of specifying programs for computers to run. Unlike natural languages, programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and to be concise. They are purely written languages and are often difficult to read aloud. They are generally either translated into machine code by a compiler or an assembler before being run, or translated directly at run time by an interpreter. Sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques.

  Low-level languages
- |
  Main article: Low-level programming language
- |
  Machine languages and the assembly languages that represent them (collectively termed low-level programming languages) tend to be unique to a particular type of computer. For instance, an ARM architecture computer (such as may be found in a PDA or a hand-held videogame) cannot understand the machine language of an Intel Pentium or the AMD Athlon 64 computer that might be in a PC.[59]
- |
  High-level languages/Third Generation Language
- |
  Main article: High-level programming language
- |
  Though considerably easier than in machine language, writing long programs in assembly language is often difficult and is also error prone. Therefore, most practical programs are written in more abstract high-level programming languages that are able to express the needs of the programmer more conveniently (and thereby help reduce programmer error). High level languages are usually "compiled" into machine language (or sometimes into assembly language and then into machine language) using another computer program called a compiler.[60] High level languages are less related to the workings of the target computer than assembly language, and more related to the language and structure of the problem(s) to be solved by the final program. It is therefore often possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level language program into the machine language of many different types of computer. This is part of the means by which software like video games may be made available for different computer architectures such as personal computers and various video game consoles.

  These 4G languages are less procedural than 3G languages. The benefit of 4GL is that it provides ways to obtain information without requiring the direct help of a programmer. Example of 4GL is SQL.

  Program design of small programs is relatively simple and involves the analysis of the problem, collection of inputs, using the programming constructs within languages, devising or using established procedures and algorithms, providing data for output devices and solutions to the problem as applicable. As problems become larger and more complex, features such as subprograms, modules, formal documentation, and new paradigms such as object-oriented programming are encountered. Large programs involving thousands of line of code and more require formal software methodologies. The task of developing large software systems presents a significant intellectual challenge. Producing software with an acceptably high reliability within a predictable schedule and budget has historically been difficult; the academic and professional discipline of software engineering concentrates specifically on this challenge.

  Errors in computer programs are called "bugs". They may be benign and not affect the usefulness of the program, or have only subtle effects. But in some cases, they may cause the program or the entire system to "hang", becoming unresponsive to input such as mouse clicks or keystrokes, to completely fail, or to crash. Otherwise benign bugs may sometimes be harnessed for malicious intent by an unscrupulous user writing an exploit, code designed to take advantage of a bug and disrupt a computer's proper execution. Bugs are usually not the fault of the computer. Since computers merely execute the instructions they are given, bugs are nearly always the result of programmer error or an oversight made in the program's design.[61]
- |
  Admiral Grace Hopper, an American computer scientist and developer of the first compiler, is credited for having first used the term "bugs" in computing after a dead moth was found shorting a relay in the Harvard Mark II computer in September 1947.[62]

  A general purpose computer has four main components: the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), the control unit, the memory, and the input and output devices (collectively termed I/O). These parts are interconnected by buses, often made of groups of wires.
- |
  Inside each of these parts are thousands to trillions of small electrical circuits which can be turned off or on by means of an electronic switch. Each circuit represents a bit (binary digit) of information so that when the circuit is on it represents a "1", and when off it represents a "0" (in positive logic representation). The circuits are arranged in logic gates so that one or more of the circuits may control the state of one or more of the other circuits.

  The control unit (often called a control system or central controller) manages the computer's various components; it reads and interprets (decodes) the program instructions, transforming them into control signals that activate other parts of the computer.[63] Control systems in advanced computers may change the order of execution of some instructions to improve performance.
- |
  A key component common to all CPUs is the program counter, a special memory cell (a register) that keeps track of which location in memory the next instruction is to be read from.[64]
- |
  The control system's function is as follows—note that this is a simplified description, and some of these steps may be performed concurrently or in a different order depending on the type of CPU:
- |
  Read the code for the next instruction from the cell indicated by the program counter.
- |
  Decode the numerical code for the instruction into a set of commands or signals for each of the other systems.
- |
  Increment the program counter so it points to the next instruction.
- |
  Read whatever data the instruction requires from cells in memory (or perhaps from an input device). The location of this required data is typically stored within the instruction code.
- |
  Provide the necessary data to an ALU or register.
- |
  If the instruction requires an ALU or specialized hardware to complete, instruct the hardware to perform the requested operation.
- |
  Write the result from the ALU back to a memory location or to a register or perhaps an output device.
- |
  Jump back to step (1).
- |
  Since the program counter is (conceptually) just another set of memory cells, it can be changed by calculations done in the ALU. Adding 100 to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place 100 locations further down the program. Instructions that modify the program counter are often known as "jumps" and allow for loops (instructions that are repeated by the computer) and often conditional instruction execution (both examples of control flow).
- |
  The sequence of operations that the control unit goes through to process an instruction is in itself like a short computer program, and indeed, in some more complex CPU designs, there is another yet smaller computer called a microsequencer, which runs a microcode program that causes all of these events to happen.
- |
  Central Processing unit (CPU)
- |
  The control unit, ALU, and registers are collectively known as a central processing unit (CPU). Early CPUs were composed of many separate components but since the mid-1970s CPUs have typically been constructed on a single integrated circuit called a microprocessor.
- |
  Arithmetic logic unit (ALU)
- |
  Main article: Arithmetic logic unit
- |
  The ALU is capable of performing two classes of operations: arithmetic and logic.[65]
- |
  The set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited to addition and subtraction, or might include multiplication, division, trigonometry functions such as sine, cosine, etc., and square roots. Some can only operate on whole numbers (integers) whilst others use floating point to represent real numbers, albeit with limited precision. However, any computer that is capable of performing just the simplest operations can be programmed to break down the more complex operations into simple steps that it can perform. Therefore, any computer can be programmed to perform any arithmetic operation—although it will take more time to do so if its ALU does not directly support the operation. An ALU may also compare numbers and return boolean truth values (true or false) depending on whether one is equal to, greater than or less than the other ("is 64 greater than 65?").
- |
  Logic operations involve Boolean logic: AND, OR, XOR, and NOT. These can be useful for creating complicated conditional statements and processing boolean logic.
- |
  Superscalar computers may contain multiple ALUs, allowing them to process several instructions simultaneously.[66]Graphics processors and computers with SIMD and MIMD features often contain ALUs that can perform arithmetic on vectors and matrices.

  A computer's memory can be viewed as a list of cells into which numbers can be placed or read. Each cell has a numbered "address" and can store a single number. The computer can be instructed to "put the number 123 into the cell numbered 1357" or to "add the number that is in cell 1357 to the number that is in cell 2468 and put the answer into cell 1595." The information stored in memory may represent practically anything. Letters, numbers, even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease. Since the CPU does not differentiate between different types of information, it is the software's responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers.
- |
  In almost all modern computers, each memory cell is set up to store binary numbers in groups of eight bits (called a byte). Each byte is able to represent 256 different numbers (2^8 = 256); either from 0 to 255 or −128 to +127. To store larger numbers, several consecutive bytes may be used (typically, two, four or eight). When negative numbers are required, they are usually stored in two's complement notation. Other arrangements are possible, but are usually not seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts. A computer can store any kind of information in memory if it can be represented numerically. Modern computers have billions or even trillions of bytes of memory.
- |
  The CPU contains a special set of memory cells called registers that can be read and written to much more rapidly than the main memory area. There are typically between two and one hundred registers depending on the type of CPU. Registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed. As data is constantly being worked on, reducing the need to access main memory (which is often slow compared to the ALU and control units) greatly increases the computer's speed.
- |
  Computer main memory comes in two principal varieties:
- |
  random-access memory or RAM
- |
  read-only memory or ROM
- |
  RAM can be read and written to anytime the CPU commands it, but ROM is preloaded with data and software that never changes, therefore the CPU can only read from it. ROM is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions. In general, the contents of RAM are erased when the power to the computer is turned off, but ROM retains its data indefinitely. In a PC, the ROM contains a specialized program called the BIOS that orchestrates loading the computer's operating system from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset. In embedded computers, which frequently do not have disk drives, all of the required software may be stored in ROM. Software stored in ROM is often called firmware, because it is notionally more like hardware than software. Flash memory blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM, as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable. It is typically much slower than conventional ROM and RAM however, so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary.[67]
- |
  In more sophisticated computers there may be one or more RAM cache memories, which are slower than registers but faster than main memory. Generally computers with this sort of cache are designed to move frequently needed data into the cache automatically, often without the need for any intervention on the programmer's part.

  I/O is the means by which a computer exchanges information with the outside world.[68] Devices that provide input or output to the computer are called peripherals.[69] On a typical personal computer, peripherals include input devices like the keyboard and mouse, and output devices such as the display and printer. Hard disk drives, floppy disk drives and optical disc drives serve as both input and output devices. Computer networking is another form of I/O.
- |
  I/O devices are often complex computers in their own right, with their own CPU and memory. A graphics processing unit might contain fifty or more tiny computers that perform the calculations necessary to display 3D graphics.[citation needed] Modern desktop computers contain many smaller computers that assist the main CPU in performing I/O.
- |
  Multitasking
- |
  Main article: Computer multitasking
- |
  While a computer may be viewed as running one gigantic program stored in its main memory, in some systems it is necessary to give the appearance of running several programs simultaneously. This is achieved by multitasking i.e. having the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn.[70]
- |
  One means by which this is done is with a special signal called an interrupt, which can periodically cause the computer to stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead. By remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt, the computer can return to that task later. If several programs are running "at the same time". then the interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second, causing a program switch each time. Since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception, it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant. This method of multitasking is sometimes termed "time-sharing" since each program is allocated a "slice" of time in turn.[71]
- |
  Before the era of cheap computers, the principal use for multitasking was to allow many people to share the same computer.
- |
  Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly, in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running, but most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks. If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a "time slice" until the event it is waiting for has occurred. This frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss.

  Some computers are designed to distribute their work across several CPUs in a multiprocessing configuration, a technique once employed only in large and powerful machines such as supercomputers, mainframe computers and servers. Multiprocessor and multi-core (multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit) personal and laptop computers are now widely available, and are being increasingly used in lower-end markets as a result.
- |
  Supercomputers in particular often have highly unique architectures that differ significantly from the basic stored-program architecture and from general purpose computers.[72] They often feature thousands of CPUs, customized high-speed interconnects, and specialized computing hardware. Such designs tend to be useful only for specialized tasks due to the large scale of program organization required to successfully utilize most of the available resources at once. Supercomputers usually see usage in large-scale simulation, graphics rendering, and cryptography applications, as well as with other so-called "embarrassingly parallel" tasks.

  Computers have been used to coordinate information between multiple locations since the 1950s. The U.S. military's SAGE system was the first large-scale example of such a system, which led to a number of special-purpose commercial systems such as Sabre.[73]
- |
  In the 1970s, computer engineers at research institutions throughout the United States began to link their computers together using telecommunications technology. The effort was funded by ARPA (now DARPA), and the computer network that resulted was called the ARPANET.[74] The technologies that made the Arpanet possible spread and evolved.
- |
  In time, the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the Internet. The emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer. Computer operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network, such as peripheral devices, stored information, and the like, as extensions of the resources of an individual computer. Initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high-tech environments, but in the 1990s the spread of applications like e-mail and the World Wide Web, combined with the development of cheap, fast networking technologies like Ethernet and ADSL saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous. In fact, the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally. A very large proportion of personal computers regularly connect to the Internet to communicate and receive information. "Wireless" networking, often utilizing mobile phone networks, has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments.

  Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) computers

  Register machine vs. Stack machine

  Logic gates are a common abstraction which can apply to most of the above digital or analog paradigms.
- |
  The ability to store and execute lists of instructions called programs makes computers extremely versatile, distinguishing them from calculators. The Church–Turing thesis is a mathematical statement of this versatility: any computer with a minimum capability (being Turing-complete) is, in principle, capable of performing the same tasks that any other computer can perform. Therefore, any type of computer (netbook, supercomputer, cellular automaton, etc.) is able to perform the same computational tasks, given enough time and storage capacity.

  A computer does not need to be electronic, nor even have a processor, nor RAM, nor even a hard disk. While popular usage of the word "computer" is synonymous with a personal electronic computer, the modern[76] definition of a computer is literally: "A device that computes, especially a programmable [usually] electronic machine that performs high-speed mathematical or logical operations or that assembles, stores, correlates, or otherwise processes information."[77] Any device which processes information qualifies as a computer, especially if the processing is purposeful.[citation needed]

  Historically, computers evolved from mechanical computers and eventually from vacuum tubes to transistors. However, conceptually computational systems as flexible as a personal computer can be built out of almost anything. For example, a computer can be made out of billiard balls (billiard ball computer); an often quoted example.[citation needed] More realistically, modern computers are made out of transistors made of photolithographed semiconductors.

  Future
- |
  There is active research to make computers out of many promising new types of technology, such as optical computers, DNA computers, neural computers, and quantum computers. Most computers are universal, and are able to calculate any computable function, and are limited only by their memory capacity and operating speed. However different designs of computers can give very different performance for particular problems; for example quantum computers can potentially break some modern encryption algorithms (by quantum factoring) very quickly.

  ^ According to Schmandt-Besserat 1981, these clay containers contained tokens, the total of which were the count of objects being transferred. The containers thus served as something of a bill of lading or an accounts book. In order to avoid breaking open the containers, first, clay impressions of the tokens were placed on the outside of the containers, for the count; the shapes of the impressions were abstracted into stylized marks; finally, the abstract marks were systematically used as numerals; these numerals were finally formalized as numbers. Eventually (Schmandt-Besserat estimates it took 4000 years[dead link]) the marks on the outside of the containers were all that were needed to convey the count, and the clay containers evolved into clay tablets with marks for the count.

  ^ Even some later computers were commonly programmed directly in machine code. Some minicomputers like the DEC PDP-8 could be programmed directly from a panel of switches. However, this method was usually used only as part of the booting process. Most modern computers boot entirely automatically by reading a boot program from some non-volatile memory.
- |
  ^ However, there is sometimes some form of machine language compatibility between different computers. An x86-64 compatible microprocessor like the AMD Athlon 64 is able to run most of the same programs that an Intel Core 2 microprocessor can, as well as programs designed for earlier microprocessors like the Intel Pentiums and Intel 80486. This contrasts with very early commercial computers, which were often one-of-a-kind and totally incompatible with other computers.
- |
  ^ High level languages are also often interpreted rather than compiled. Interpreted languages are translated into machine code on the fly, while running, by another program called an interpreter.
- |
  ^ It is not universally true that bugs are solely due to programmer oversight. Computer hardware may fail or may itself have a fundamental problem that produces unexpected results in certain situations. For instance, the Pentium FDIV bug caused some Intel microprocessors in the early 1990s to produce inaccurate results for certain floating point division operations. This was caused by a flaw in the microprocessor design and resulted in a partial recall of the affected devices.

  ^ The control unit's role in interpreting instructions has varied somewhat in the past. Although the control unit is solely responsible for instruction interpretation in most modern computers, this is not always the case. Some computers have instructions that are partially interpreted by the control unit with further interpretation performed by another device. For example, EDVAC, one of the earliest stored-program computers, used a central control unit that only interpreted four instructions. All of the arithmetic-related instructions were passed on to its arithmetic unit and further decoded there.
- |
  ^ Instructions often occupy more than one memory address, therefore the program counter usually increases by the number of memory locations required to store one instruction.

  ^ However, it is also very common to construct supercomputers out of many pieces of cheap commodity hardware; usually individual computers connected by networks. These so-called computer clusters can often provide supercomputer performance at a much lower cost than customized designs. While custom architectures are still used for most of the most powerful supercomputers, there has been a proliferation of cluster computers in recent years. (TOP500 2006)

- '} );A computer is a general-purpose device that can be programmed to carry out
  a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Since a sequence of operations
  can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.Conventionally,
  a computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing
  unit (CPU), and some form of memory. The processing element carries out arithmetic
  and logic operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of
  operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices allow information
  to be retrieved from an external source, and the result of operations saved and
  retrieved.Mechanical analog computers started appearing in the first century and
  were later used in the medieval era for astronomical calculations. In World War
  II, mechanical analog computers were used for specialized military applications
  such as calculating torpedo aiming. During this time the first electronic digital
  computers were developed. Originally they were the size of a large room, consuming
  as much power as several hundred modern personal computers (PCs).[1]Modern computers
  based on integrated circuits are millions to billions of times more capable than
  the early machines, and occupy a fraction of the space.[2] Computers are small enough
  to fit into mobile devices, and mobile computers can be powered by small batteries.
  Personal computers in their various forms are icons of the Information Age and are
  generally considered as "computers". However, the embedded computers found in many
  devices from MP3 players to fighter aircraft and from electronic toys to industrial
  robots are the most numerous.The first known use of the word "computer" was in 1613
  in a book called The Yong Mans Gleanings by English writer Richard Braithwait: "I
  haue read the truest computer of Times, and the best Arithmetician that euer breathed,
  and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number." It referred to a person who carried
  out calculations, or computations. The word continued with the same meaning until
  the middle of the 20th century. From the end of the 19th century the word began
  to take on its more familiar meaning, a machine that carries out computations.[3]Devices
  have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, mostly using one-to-one
  correspondence with fingers. The earliest counting device was probably a form of
  tally stick. Later record keeping aids throughout the Fertile Crescent included
  calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably
  livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers.[4][5] The use of
  counting rods is one example.The abacus was initially used for arithmetic tasks.
  The Roman abacus was used in Babylonia as early as 2400 BC. Since then, many other
  forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented. In a medieval European counting
  house, a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on
  it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money.The Antikythera
  mechanism is believed to be the earliest mechanical analog "computer", according
  to Derek J. de Solla Price.[6] It was designed to calculate astronomical positions.
  It was discovered in 1901 in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera,
  between Kythera and Crete, and has been dated to circa 100 BC. Devices of a level
  of complexity comparable to that of the Antikythera mechanism would not reappear
  until a thousand years later.Many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement
  were constructed for astronomical and navigation use. The planisphere was a star
  chart invented by Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī in the early 11th century.[7] The astrolabe
  was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and
  is often attributed to Hipparchus. A combination of the planisphere and dioptra,
  the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several
  different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy. An astrolabe incorporating a
  mechanical calendar computer[8][9] and gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan,
  Persia in 1235.[10]Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar
  calendar astrolabe,[11] an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine[12] with
  a gear train and gear-wheels,[13]circa 1000 AD.The sector, a calculating instrument
  used for solving problems in proportion, trigonometry, multiplication and division,
  and for various functions, such as squares and cube roots, was developed in the
  late 16th century and found application in gunnery, surveying and navigation.The
  planimeter was a manual instrument to calculate the area of a closed figure by tracing
  over it with a mechanical linkage.The slide rule was invented around 1620–1630,
  shortly after the publication of the concept of the logarithm. It is a hand-operated
  analog computer for doing multiplication and division. As slide rule development
  progressed, added scales provided reciprocals, squares and square roots, cubes and
  cube roots, as well as transcendental functions such as logarithms and exponentials,
  circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other functions. Aviation is one of the
  few fields where slide rules are still in widespread use, particularly for solving
  time–distance problems in light aircraft. To save space and for ease of reading,
  these are typically circular devices rather than the classic linear slide rule shape.
  A popular example is the E6B.In the 1770s Pierre Jaquet-Droz, a Swiss watchmaker,
  built a mechanical doll (automata) that could write holding a quill pen. By switching
  the number and order of its internal wheels different letters, and hence different
  messages, could be produced. In effect, it could be mechanically "programmed" to
  read instructions. Along with two other complex machines, the doll is at the Musée
  d''Art et d''Histoire of Neuchâtel, Switzerland, and still operates.[14]The tide-predicting
  machine invented by Sir William Thomson in 1872 was of great utility to navigation
  in shallow waters. It used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate
  predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location.The differential
  analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations
  by integration, used wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration. In 1876
  Lord Kelvin had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators,
  but he had been stymied by the limited output torque of the ball-and-disk integrators.[15]
  In a differential analyzer, the output of one integrator drove the input of the
  next integrator, or a graphing output. The torque amplifier was the advance that
  allowed these machines to work. Starting in the 1920s, Vannevar Bush and others
  developed mechanical differential analyzers.Charles Babbage, an English mechanical
  engineer and polymath, originated the concept of a programmable computer. Considered
  the "father of the computer",[16] he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical
  computer in the early 19th century. After working on his revolutionary difference
  engine, designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a
  much more general design, an Analytical Engine, was possible. The input of programs
  and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used
  at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom. For output, the
  machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also
  be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated
  an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and
  loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer
  that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete.[17][18]The machine was
  about a century ahead of its time. All the parts for his machine had to be made
  by hand — this was a major problem for a device with thousands of parts. Eventually,
  the project was dissolved with the decision of the British Government to cease funding.
  Babbage''s failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to
  difficulties not only of politics and financing, but also to his desire to develop
  an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else
  could follow. Nevertheless, his son, Henry Babbage, completed a simplified version
  of the analytical engine''s computing unit (the mill) in 1888. He gave a successful
  demonstration of its use in computing tables in 1906.During the first half of the
  20th century, many scientific computing needs were met by increasingly sophisticated
  analog computers, which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem
  as a basis for computation. However, these were not programmable and generally lacked
  the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers.[19]The first modern analog
  computer was a tide-predicting machine, invented by Sir William Thomson in 1872.
  The differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential
  equations by integration using wheel-and-disc mechanisms, was conceptualized in
  1876 by James Thomson, the brother of the more famous Lord Kelvin.[15]The art of
  mechanical analog computing reached its zenith with the differential analyzer, built
  by H. L. Hazen and Vannevar Bush at MIT starting in 1927. This built on the mechanical
  integrators of James Thomson and the torque amplifiers invented by H. W. Nieman.
  A dozen of these devices were built before their obsolescence became obvious.By
  the 1950s the success of digital electronic computers had spelled the end for most
  analog computing machines, but analog computers remain in use in some specialized
  applications such as education (control systems) and aircraft (slide rule).The principle
  of the modern computer was first described by mathematician and pioneering computer
  scientist Alan Turing, who set out the idea in his seminal 1936 paper,[20]On Computable
  Numbers. Turing reformulated Kurt Gödel''s 1931 results on the limits of proof and
  computation, replacing Gödel''s universal arithmetic-based formal language with
  the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines.
  He proved that some such machine would be capable of performing any conceivable
  mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to
  prove that there was no solution to the Entscheidungsproblem by first showing that
  the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable: in general, it is not possible
  to decide algorithmically whether a given Turing machine will ever halt.He also
  introduced the notion of a ''Universal Machine'' (now known as a Universal Turing
  machine), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other
  machine, or in other words, it is provably capable of computing anything that is
  computable by executing a program stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable.
  Von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due
  to this paper.[21] Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in
  theory of computation. Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory
  stores, modern computers are said to be Turing-complete, which is to say, they have
  algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal Turing machine.By 1938
  the United States Navy had developed an electromechanical analog computer small
  enough to use aboard a submarine. This was the Torpedo Data Computer, which used
  trigonometry to solve the problem of firing a torpedo at a moving target. During
  World War II similar devices were developed in other countries as well.Early digital
  computers were electromechanical; electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform
  the calculation. These devices had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded
  by much faster all-electric computers, originally using vacuum tubes. The Z2, created
  by German engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939, was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical
  relay computer.[22]In 1941, Zuse followed his earlier machine up with the Z3, the
  world''s first working electromechanical programmable, fully automatic digital computer.[23][24]
  The Z3 was built with 2000 relays, implementing a 22 bit word length that operated
  at a clock frequency of about 5–10 Hz.[25] Program code was supplied on punched
  film while data could be stored in 64 words of memory or supplied from the keyboard.
  It was quite similar to modern machines in some respects, pioneering numerous advances
  such as floating point numbers. Replacement of the hard-to-implement decimal system
  (used in Charles Babbage''s earlier design) by the simpler binary system meant that
  Zuse''s machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable, given the technologies
  available at that time.[26] The Z3 was Turing complete.[27][28]Purely electronic
  circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents,
  at the same time that digital calculation replaced analog. The engineer Tommy Flowers,
  working at the Post Office Research Station in London in the 1930s, began to explore
  the possible use of electronics for the telephone exchange. Experimental equipment
  that he built in 1934 went into operation 5 years later, converting a portion of
  the telephone exchange network into an electronic data processing system, using
  thousands of vacuum tubes.[19] In the US, John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford E.
  Berry of Iowa State University developed and tested the Atanasoff–Berry Computer
  (ABC) in 1942,[29] the first "automatic electronic digital computer".[30] This design
  was also all-electronic and used about 300 vacuum tubes, with capacitors fixed in
  a mechanically rotating drum for memory.[31]During World War II, the British at
  Bletchley Park achieved a number of successes at breaking encrypted German military
  communications. The German encryption machine, Enigma, was first attacked with the
  help of the electro-mechanical bombes. To crack the more sophisticated German Lorenz
  SZ 40/42 machine, used for high-level Army communications, Max Newman and his colleagues
  commissioned Flowers to build the Colossus.[31] He spent eleven months from early
  February 1943 designing and building the first Colossus.[32] After a functional
  test in December 1943, Colossus was shipped to Bletchley Park, where it was delivered
  on 18 January 1944[33] and attacked its first message on 5 February.[31]Colossus
  was the world''s first electronic digital programmable computer.[19] It used a large
  number of valves (vacuum tubes). It had paper-tape input and was capable of being
  configured to perform a variety of boolean logical operations on its data, but it
  was not Turing-complete. Nine Mk II Colossi were built (The Mk I was converted to
  a Mk II making ten machines in total). Colossus Mark I contained 1500 thermionic
  valves (tubes), but Mark II with 2400 valves, was both 5 times faster and simpler
  to operate than Mark 1, greatly speeding the decoding process.[34][35]The US-built
  ENIAC[36] (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first electronic
  programmable computer built in the US. Although the ENIAC was similar to the Colossus
  it was much faster and more flexible. It was unambiguously a Turing-complete device
  and could compute any problem that would fit into its memory. Like the Colossus,
  a "program" on the ENIAC was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches,
  a far cry from the stored program electronic machines that came later. Once a program
  was written, it had to be mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting
  of plugs and switches.It combined the high speed of electronics with the ability
  to be programmed for many complex problems. It could add or subtract 5000 times
  a second, a thousand times faster than any other machine. It also had modules to
  multiply, divide, and square root. High speed memory was limited to 20 words (about
  80 bytes). Built under the direction of John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert at the
  University of Pennsylvania, ENIAC''s development and construction lasted from 1943
  to full operation at the end of 1945. The machine was huge, weighing 30 tons, using
  200 kilowatts of electric power and contained over 18,000 vacuum tubes, 1,500 relays,
  and hundreds of thousands of resistors, capacitors, and inductors.[37]Early computing
  machines had fixed programs. Changing its function required the re-wiring and re-structuring
  of the machine.[31] With the proposal of the stored-program computer this changed.
  A stored-program computer includes by design an instruction set and can store in
  memory a set of instructions (a program) that details the computation. The theoretical
  basis for the stored-program computer was laid by Alan Turing in his 1936 paper.
  In 1945 Turing joined the National Physical Laboratory and began work on developing
  an electronic stored-program digital computer. His 1945 report ‘Proposed Electronic
  Calculator’ was the first specification for such a device. John von Neumann at the
  University of Pennsylvania, also circulated his First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC
  in 1945.[19]The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine, nicknamed Baby, was
  the world''s first stored-program computer. It was built at the Victoria University
  of Manchester by Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill, and ran its
  first program on 21 June 1948.[38] It was designed as a testbed for the Williams
  tube the first random-access digital storage device.[39] Although the computer was
  considered "small and primitive" by the standards of its time, it was the first
  working machine to contain all of the elements essential to a modern electronic
  computer.[40] As soon as the SSEM had demonstrated the feasibility of its design,
  a project was initiated at the university to develop it into a more usable computer,
  the Manchester Mark 1.The Mark 1 in turn quickly became the prototype for the Ferranti
  Mark 1, the world''s first commercially available general-purpose computer.[41]
  Built by Ferranti, it was delivered to the University of Manchester in February
  1951. At least seven of these later machines were delivered between 1953 and 1957,
  one of them to Shell labs in Amsterdam.[42] In October 1947, the directors of British
  catering company J. Lyons & Company decided to take an active role in promoting
  the commercial development of computers. The LEO I computer became operational in
  April 1951 [43] and ran the world''s first regular routine office computer job.The
  bipolar transistor was invented in 1947. From 1955 onwards transistors replaced
  vacuum tubes in computer designs, giving rise to the "second generation" of computers.
  Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors have many advantages: they are smaller, and
  require less power than vacuum tubes, so give off less heat. Silicon junction transistors
  were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer, indefinite, service life.
  Transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits
  in a relatively compact space.At the University of Manchester, a team under the
  leadership of Tom Kilburn designed and built a machine using the newly developed
  transistors instead of valves.[44] Their first transistorised computer and the first
  in the world, was operational by 1953, and a second version was completed there
  in April 1955. However, the machine did make use of valves to generate its 125 kHz
  clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic drum memory,
  so it was not the first completely transistorized computer. That distinction goes
  to the Harwell CADET of 1955,[45] built by the electronics division of the Atomic
  Energy Research Establishment at Harwell.[46][47]The next great advance in computing
  power came with the advent of the integrated circuit. The idea of the integrated
  circuit was first conceived by a radar scientist working for the Royal Radar Establishment
  of the Ministry of Defence, Geoffrey W.A. Dummer. Dummer presented the first public
  description of an integrated circuit at the Symposium on Progress in Quality Electronic
  Components in Washington, D.C. on 7 May 1952.[48]The first practical ICs were invented
  by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor.[49]
  Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in July 1958,
  successfully demonstrating the first working integrated example on 12 September
  1958.[50] In his patent application of 6 February 1959, Kilby described his new
  device as "a body of semiconductor material ... wherein all the components of the
  electronic circuit are completely integrated".[51][52] Noyce also came up with his
  own idea of an integrated circuit half a year later than Kilby.[53] His chip solved
  many practical problems that Kilby''s had not. Produced at Fairchild Semiconductor,
  it was made of silicon, whereas Kilby''s chip was made of germanium.This new development
  heralded an explosion in the commercial and personal use of computers and led to
  the invention of the microprocessor. While the subject of exactly which device was
  the first microprocessor is contentious, partly due to lack of agreement on the
  exact definition of the term "microprocessor", it is largely undisputed that the
  first single-chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004,[54] designed and realized by
  Ted Hoff, Federico Faggin, and Stanley Mazor at Intel.[55]With the continued miniaturization
  of computing resources, and advancements in portable battery life, portable computers
  grew in popularity in the 2000s.[56] The same developments that spurred the growth
  of laptop computers and other portable computers allowed manufacturers to integrate
  computing resources into cellular phones. These so-called smartphones and tablets
  run on a variety of operating systems and have become the dominant computing device
  on the market, with manufacturers reporting having shipped an estimated 237 million
  devices in 2Q 2013.[57]The defining feature of modern computers which distinguishes
  them from all other machines is that they can be programmed. That is to say that
  some type of instructions (the program) can be given to the computer, and it will
  process them. Modern computers based on the von Neumann architecture often have
  machine code in the form of an imperative programming language.In practical terms,
  a computer program may be just a few instructions or extend to many millions of
  instructions, as do the programs for word processors and web browsers for example.
  A typical modern computer can execute billions of instructions per second (gigaflops)
  and rarely makes a mistake over many years of operation. Large computer programs
  consisting of several million instructions may take teams of programmers years to
  write, and due to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors.This
  section applies to most common RAM machine-based computers.In most cases, computer
  instructions are simple: add one number to another, move some data from one location
  to another, send a message to some external device, etc. These instructions are
  read from the computer''s memory and are generally carried out (executed) in the
  order they were given. However, there are usually specialized instructions to tell
  the computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in the program and to
  carry on executing from there. These are called "jump" instructions (or branches).
  Furthermore, jump instructions may be made to happen conditionally so that different
  sequences of instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation
  or some external event. Many computers directly support subroutines by providing
  a type of jump that "remembers" the location it jumped from and another instruction
  to return to the instruction following that jump instruction.Program execution might
  be likened to reading a book. While a person will normally read each word and line
  in sequence, they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip
  sections that are not of interest. Similarly, a computer may sometimes go back and
  repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again until
  some internal condition is met. This is called the flow of control within the program
  and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention.Comparatively,
  a person using a pocket calculator can perform a basic arithmetic operation such
  as adding two numbers with just a few button presses. But to add together all of
  the numbers from 1 to 1,000 would take thousands of button presses and a lot of
  time, with a near certainty of making a mistake. On the other hand, a computer may
  be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions. The following example
  is written in the MIPS assembly language:Once told to run this program, the computer
  will perform the repetitive addition task without further human intervention. It
  will almost never make a mistake and a modern PC can complete the task in a fraction
  of a second.In most computers, individual instructions are stored as machine code
  with each instruction being given a unique number (its operation code or opcode
  for short). The command to add two numbers together would have one opcode; the command
  to multiply them would have a different opcode, and so on. The simplest computers
  are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions; the more complex
  computers have several hundred to choose from, each with a unique numerical code.
  Since the computer''s memory is able to store numbers, it can also store the instruction
  codes. This leads to the important fact that entire programs (which are just lists
  of these instructions) can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves
  be manipulated inside the computer in the same way as numeric data. The fundamental
  concept of storing programs in the computer''s memory alongside the data they operate
  on is the crux of the von Neumann, or stored program[citation needed], architecture.
  In some cases, a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that
  is kept separate from the data it operates on. This is called the Harvard architecture
  after the Harvard Mark I computer. Modern von Neumann computers display some traits
  of the Harvard architecture in their designs, such as in CPU caches.While it is
  possible to write computer programs as long lists of numbers (machine language)
  and while this technique was used with many early computers,[58] it is extremely
  tedious and potentially error-prone to do so in practice, especially for complicated
  programs. Instead, each basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative
  of its function and easy to remember – a mnemonic such as ADD, SUB, MULT or JUMP.
  These mnemonics are collectively known as a computer''s assembly language. Converting
  programs written in assembly language into something the computer can actually understand
  (machine language) is usually done by a computer program called an assembler.Programming
  languages provide various ways of specifying programs for computers to run. Unlike
  natural languages, programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and
  to be concise. They are purely written languages and are often difficult to read
  aloud. They are generally either translated into machine code by a compiler or an
  assembler before being run, or translated directly at run time by an interpreter.
  Sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques.Machine
  languages and the assembly languages that represent them (collectively termed low-level
  programming languages) tend to be unique to a particular type of computer. For instance,
  an ARM architecture computer (such as may be found in a PDA or a hand-held videogame)
  cannot understand the machine language of an Intel Pentium or the AMD Athlon 64
  computer that might be in a PC.[59]Though considerably easier than in machine language,
  writing long programs in assembly language is often difficult and is also error
  prone. Therefore, most practical programs are written in more abstract high-level
  programming languages that are able to express the needs of the programmer more
  conveniently (and thereby help reduce programmer error). High level languages are
  usually "compiled" into machine language (or sometimes into assembly language and
  then into machine language) using another computer program called a compiler.[60]
  High level languages are less related to the workings of the target computer than
  assembly language, and more related to the language and structure of the problem(s)
  to be solved by the final program. It is therefore often possible to use different
  compilers to translate the same high level language program into the machine language
  of many different types of computer. This is part of the means by which software
  like video games may be made available for different computer architectures such
  as personal computers and various video game consoles.These 4G languages are less
  procedural than 3G languages. The benefit of 4GL is that it provides ways to obtain
  information without requiring the direct help of a programmer. Example of 4GL is
  SQL.Program design of small programs is relatively simple and involves the analysis
  of the problem, collection of inputs, using the programming constructs within languages,
  devising or using established procedures and algorithms, providing data for output
  devices and solutions to the problem as applicable. As problems become larger and
  more complex, features such as subprograms, modules, formal documentation, and new
  paradigms such as object-oriented programming are encountered. Large programs involving
  thousands of line of code and more require formal software methodologies. The task
  of developing large software systems presents a significant intellectual challenge.
  Producing software with an acceptably high reliability within a predictable schedule
  and budget has historically been difficult; the academic and professional discipline
  of software engineering concentrates specifically on this challenge.Errors in computer
  programs are called "bugs". They may be benign and not affect the usefulness of
  the program, or have only subtle effects. But in some cases, they may cause the
  program or the entire system to "hang", becoming unresponsive to input such as mouse
  clicks or keystrokes, to completely fail, or to crash. Otherwise benign bugs may
  sometimes be harnessed for malicious intent by an unscrupulous user writing an exploit,
  code designed to take advantage of a bug and disrupt a computer''s proper execution.
  Bugs are usually not the fault of the computer. Since computers merely execute the
  instructions they are given, bugs are nearly always the result of programmer error
  or an oversight made in the program''s design.[61]Admiral Grace Hopper, an American
  computer scientist and developer of the first compiler, is credited for having first
  used the term "bugs" in computing after a dead moth was found shorting a relay in
  the Harvard Mark II computer in September 1947.[62]A general purpose computer has
  four main components: the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), the control unit, the memory,
  and the input and output devices (collectively termed I/O). These parts are interconnected
  by buses, often made of groups of wires.Inside each of these parts are thousands
  to trillions of small electrical circuits which can be turned off or on by means
  of an electronic switch. Each circuit represents a bit (binary digit) of information
  so that when the circuit is on it represents a "1", and when off it represents a
  "0" (in positive logic representation). The circuits are arranged in logic gates
  so that one or more of the circuits may control the state of one or more of the
  other circuits.The control unit (often called a control system or central controller)
  manages the computer''s various components; it reads and interprets (decodes) the
  program instructions, transforming them into control signals that activate other
  parts of the computer.[63] Control systems in advanced computers may change the
  order of execution of some instructions to improve performance.A key component common
  to all CPUs is the program counter, a special memory cell (a register) that keeps
  track of which location in memory the next instruction is to be read from.[64]The
  control system''s function is as follows—note that this is a simplified description,
  and some of these steps may be performed concurrently or in a different order depending
  on the type of CPU:Since the program counter is (conceptually) just another set
  of memory cells, it can be changed by calculations done in the ALU. Adding 100 to
  the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place 100
  locations further down the program. Instructions that modify the program counter
  are often known as "jumps" and allow for loops (instructions that are repeated by
  the computer) and often conditional instruction execution (both examples of control
  flow).The sequence of operations that the control unit goes through to process an
  instruction is in itself like a short computer program, and indeed, in some more
  complex CPU designs, there is another yet smaller computer called a microsequencer,
  which runs a microcode program that causes all of these events to happen.The control
  unit, ALU, and registers are collectively known as a central processing unit (CPU).
  Early CPUs were composed of many separate components but since the mid-1970s CPUs
  have typically been constructed on a single integrated circuit called a microprocessor.The
  ALU is capable of performing two classes of operations: arithmetic and logic.[65]The
  set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited to addition
  and subtraction, or might include multiplication, division, trigonometry functions
  such as sine, cosine, etc., and square roots. Some can only operate on whole numbers
  (integers) whilst others use floating point to represent real numbers, albeit with
  limited precision. However, any computer that is capable of performing just the
  simplest operations can be programmed to break down the more complex operations
  into simple steps that it can perform. Therefore, any computer can be programmed
  to perform any arithmetic operation—although it will take more time to do so if
  its ALU does not directly support the operation. An ALU may also compare numbers
  and return boolean truth values (true or false) depending on whether one is equal
  to, greater than or less than the other ("is 64 greater than 65?").Logic operations
  involve Boolean logic: AND, OR, XOR, and NOT. These can be useful for creating complicated
  conditional statements and processing boolean logic.Superscalar computers may contain
  multiple ALUs, allowing them to process several instructions simultaneously.[66]Graphics
  processors and computers with SIMD and MIMD features often contain ALUs that can
  perform arithmetic on vectors and matrices.A computer''s memory can be viewed as
  a list of cells into which numbers can be placed or read. Each cell has a numbered
  "address" and can store a single number. The computer can be instructed to "put
  the number 123 into the cell numbered 1357" or to "add the number that is in cell
  1357 to the number that is in cell 2468 and put the answer into cell 1595." The
  information stored in memory may represent practically anything. Letters, numbers,
  even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease. Since the
  CPU does not differentiate between different types of information, it is the software''s
  responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series
  of numbers.In almost all modern computers, each memory cell is set up to store binary
  numbers in groups of eight bits (called a byte). Each byte is able to represent
  256 different numbers (2^8 = 256); either from 0 to 255 or −128 to +127. To store
  larger numbers, several consecutive bytes may be used (typically, two, four or eight).
  When negative numbers are required, they are usually stored in two''s complement
  notation. Other arrangements are possible, but are usually not seen outside of specialized
  applications or historical contexts. A computer can store any kind of information
  in memory if it can be represented numerically. Modern computers have billions or
  even trillions of bytes of memory.The CPU contains a special set of memory cells
  called registers that can be read and written to much more rapidly than the main
  memory area. There are typically between two and one hundred registers depending
  on the type of CPU. Registers are used for the most frequently needed data items
  to avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed. As data is constantly
  being worked on, reducing the need to access main memory (which is often slow compared
  to the ALU and control units) greatly increases the computer''s speed.Computer main
  memory comes in two principal varieties:RAM can be read and written to anytime the
  CPU commands it, but ROM is preloaded with data and software that never changes,
  therefore the CPU can only read from it. ROM is typically used to store the computer''s
  initial start-up instructions. In general, the contents of RAM are erased when the
  power to the computer is turned off, but ROM retains its data indefinitely. In a
  PC, the ROM contains a specialized program called the BIOS that orchestrates loading
  the computer''s operating system from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the
  computer is turned on or reset. In embedded computers, which frequently do not have
  disk drives, all of the required software may be stored in ROM. Software stored
  in ROM is often called firmware, because it is notionally more like hardware than
  software. Flash memory blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM, as it retains
  its data when turned off but is also rewritable. It is typically much slower than
  conventional ROM and RAM however, so its use is restricted to applications where
  high speed is unnecessary.[67]In more sophisticated computers there may be one or
  more RAM cache memories, which are slower than registers but faster than main memory.
  Generally computers with this sort of cache are designed to move frequently needed
  data into the cache automatically, often without the need for any intervention on
  the programmer''s part.I/O is the means by which a computer exchanges information
  with the outside world.[68] Devices that provide input or output to the computer
  are called peripherals.[69] On a typical personal computer, peripherals include
  input devices like the keyboard and mouse, and output devices such as the display
  and printer. Hard disk drives, floppy disk drives and optical disc drives serve
  as both input and output devices. Computer networking is another form of I/O.I/O
  devices are often complex computers in their own right, with their own CPU and memory.
  A graphics processing unit might contain fifty or more tiny computers that perform
  the calculations necessary to display 3D graphics.[citation needed] Modern desktop
  computers contain many smaller computers that assist the main CPU in performing
  I/O.While a computer may be viewed as running one gigantic program stored in its
  main memory, in some systems it is necessary to give the appearance of running several
  programs simultaneously. This is achieved by multitasking i.e. having the computer
  switch rapidly between running each program in turn.[70]One means by which this
  is done is with a special signal called an interrupt, which can periodically cause
  the computer to stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead.
  By remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt, the computer can return
  to that task later. If several programs are running "at the same time". then the
  interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second, causing
  a program switch each time. Since modern computers typically execute instructions
  several orders of magnitude faster than human perception, it may appear that many
  programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in
  any given instant. This method of multitasking is sometimes termed "time-sharing"
  since each program is allocated a "slice" of time in turn.[71]Before the era of
  cheap computers, the principal use for multitasking was to allow many people to
  share the same computer.Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching
  between several programs to run more slowly, in direct proportion to the number
  of programs it is running, but most programs spend much of their time waiting for
  slow input/output devices to complete their tasks. If a program is waiting for the
  user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take
  a "time slice" until the event it is waiting for has occurred. This frees up time
  for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without
  unacceptable speed loss.Some computers are designed to distribute their work across
  several CPUs in a multiprocessing configuration, a technique once employed only
  in large and powerful machines such as supercomputers, mainframe computers and servers.
  Multiprocessor and multi-core (multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit) personal
  and laptop computers are now widely available, and are being increasingly used in
  lower-end markets as a result.Supercomputers in particular often have highly unique
  architectures that differ significantly from the basic stored-program architecture
  and from general purpose computers.[72] They often feature thousands of CPUs, customized
  high-speed interconnects, and specialized computing hardware. Such designs tend
  to be useful only for specialized tasks due to the large scale of program organization
  required to successfully utilize most of the available resources at once. Supercomputers
  usually see usage in large-scale simulation, graphics rendering, and cryptography
  applications, as well as with other so-called "embarrassingly parallel" tasks.Computers
  have been used to coordinate information between multiple locations since the 1950s.
  The U.S. military''s SAGE system was the first large-scale example of such a system,
  which led to a number of special-purpose commercial systems such as Sabre.[73]In
  the 1970s, computer engineers at research institutions throughout the United States
  began to link their computers together using telecommunications technology. The
  effort was funded by ARPA (now DARPA), and the computer network that resulted was
  called the ARPANET.[74] The technologies that made the Arpanet possible spread and
  evolved.In time, the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and
  became known as the Internet. The emergence of networking involved a redefinition
  of the nature and boundaries of the computer. Computer operating systems and applications
  were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other
  computers on the network, such as peripheral devices, stored information, and the
  like, as extensions of the resources of an individual computer. Initially these
  facilities were available primarily to people working in high-tech environments,
  but in the 1990s the spread of applications like e-mail and the World Wide Web,
  combined with the development of cheap, fast networking technologies like Ethernet
  and ADSL saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous. In fact, the number of
  computers that are networked is growing phenomenally. A very large proportion of
  personal computers regularly connect to the Internet to communicate and receive
  information. "Wireless" networking, often utilizing mobile phone networks, has meant
  networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments.There
  are many types of computer architectures:Of all these abstract machines, a quantum
  computer holds the most promise for revolutionizing computing.[75]Logic gates are
  a common abstraction which can apply to most of the above digital or analog paradigms.The
  ability to store and execute lists of instructions called programs makes computers
  extremely versatile, distinguishing them from calculators. The Church–Turing thesis
  is a mathematical statement of this versatility: any computer with a minimum capability
  (being Turing-complete) is, in principle, capable of performing the same tasks that
  any other computer can perform. Therefore, any type of computer (netbook, supercomputer,
  cellular automaton, etc.) is able to perform the same computational tasks, given
  enough time and storage capacity.A computer does not need to be electronic, nor
  even have a processor, nor RAM, nor even a hard disk. While popular usage of the
  word "computer" is synonymous with a personal electronic computer, the modern[76]
  definition of a computer is literally: "A device that computes, especially a programmable
  [usually] electronic machine that performs high-speed mathematical or logical operations
  or that assembles, stores, correlates, or otherwise processes information."[77]
  Any device which processes information qualifies as a computer, especially if the
  processing is purposeful.[citation needed]Historically, computers evolved from mechanical
  computers and eventually from vacuum tubes to transistors. However, conceptually
  computational systems as flexible as a personal computer can be built out of almost
  anything. For example, a computer can be made out of billiard balls (billiard ball
  computer); an often quoted example.[citation needed] More realistically, modern
  computers are made out of transistors made of photolithographed semiconductors.There
  is active research to make computers out of many promising new types of technology,
  such as optical computers, DNA computers, neural computers, and quantum computers.
  Most computers are universal, and are able to calculate any computable function,
  and are limited only by their memory capacity and operating speed. However different
  designs of computers can give very different performance for particular problems;
  for example quantum computers can potentially break some modern encryption algorithms
  (by quantum factoring) very quickly.A computer will solve problems in exactly the
  way it is programmed to, without regard to efficiency, alternative solutions, possible
  shortcuts, or possible errors in the code. Computer programs that learn and adapt
  are part of the emerging field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.The
  term hardware covers all of those parts of a computer that are tangible objects.
  Circuits, displays, power supplies, cables, keyboards, printers and mice are all
  hardware.Software refers to parts of the computer which do not have a material form,
  such as programs, data, protocols, etc. When software is stored in hardware that
  cannot easily be modified (such as BIOS ROM in an IBM PC compatible), it is sometimes
  called "firmware".There are thousands of different programming languages—some intended
  to be general purpose, others useful only for highly specialized applications.Firmware
  is the technology which has the combination of both hardware and software such as
  BIOS chip inside a computer. This chip (hardware) is located on the motherboard
  and has the BIOS set up (software) stored in it.Computers are typically classified
  based on their uses:When unprocessed data is sent to the computer with the help
  of input devices, the data is processed and sent to output devices. The input devices
  may be hand-operated or automated. The act of processing is mainly regulated by
  the CPU. Some examples of hand-operated input devices are:The means through which
  computer gives output are known as output devices. Some examples of output devices
  are:As the use of computers has spread throughout society, there are an increasing
  number of careers involving computers.The need for computers to work well together
  and to be able to exchange information has spawned the need for many standards organizations,
  clubs and societies of both a formal and informal nature.Wikiversity has a quiz

  Technology Limited. For other uses, see Computer (disambiguation) and Computer system
  (disambiguation).\nComputer\n\n\n\nA computer is a general-purpose device that can
  be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically.
  Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more
  than one kind of problem.\nConventionally, a computer consists of at least one processing
  element, typically a central processing unit (CPU), and some form of memory. The
  processing element carries out arithmetic and logic operations, and a sequencing
  and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information.
  Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source, and
  the result of operations saved and retrieved.\nMechanical analog computers started
  appearing in the first century and were later used in the medieval era for astronomical
  calculations. In World War II, mechanical analog computers were used for specialized
  military applications such as calculating torpedo aiming. During this time the first
  electronic digital computers were developed. Originally they were the size of a
  large room, consuming as much power as several hundred modern personal computers
  (PCs).[1]\nModern computers based on integrated circuits are millions to billions
  of times more capable than the early machines, and occupy a fraction of the space.[2]
  Computers are small enough to fit into mobile devices, and mobile computers can
  be powered by small batteries. Personal computers in their various forms are icons
  of the Information Age and are generally considered as \"computers\". However, the
  embedded computers found in many devices from MP3 players to fighter aircraft and
  from electronic toys to industrial robots are the most numerous.\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1

  Notes\n18 References\n19 External links\n\n\nEtymology\nThe first known use of the
  word \"computer\" was in 1613 in a book called The Yong Mans Gleanings by English
  writer Richard Braithwait: \"I haue read the truest computer of Times, and the best
  Arithmetician that euer breathed, and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number.\"
  It referred to a person who carried out calculations, or computations. The word
  continued with the same meaning until the middle of the 20th century. From the end
  of the 19th century the word began to take on its more familiar meaning, a machine
  that carries out computations.[3]\nHistory\nMain article: History of computing hardware\nPre-twentieth
  century\n\n\n\n\nThe Ishango bone\n\n\nDevices have been used to aid computation
  for thousands of years, mostly using one-to-one correspondence with fingers. The
  earliest counting device was probably a form of tally stick. Later record keeping
  aids throughout the Fertile Crescent included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.)
  which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in hollow
  unbaked clay containers.[4][5] The use of counting rods is one example.\n\n\n\n\nSuanpan
  (the number represented on this abacus is 6,302,715,408)\n\n\nThe abacus was initially
  used for arithmetic tasks. The Roman abacus was used in Babylonia as early as 2400
  BC. Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented.
  In a medieval European counting house, a checkered cloth would be placed on a table,
  and markers moved around on it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating
  sums of money.\n\n\n\n\nThe ancient Greek-designed Antikythera mechanism, dating
  between 150 to 100 BC, is the world's oldest analog computer.\n\n\nThe Antikythera
  mechanism is believed to be the earliest mechanical analog \"computer\", according
  to Derek J. de Solla Price.[6] It was designed to calculate astronomical positions.
  It was discovered in 1901 in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera,
  between Kythera and Crete, and has been dated to circa 100 BC. Devices of a level
  of complexity comparable to that of the Antikythera mechanism would not reappear
  until a thousand years later.\nMany mechanical aids to calculation and measurement
  were constructed for astronomical and navigation use. The planisphere was a star
  chart invented by Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī in the early 11th century.[7] The astrolabe
  was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and
  is often attributed to Hipparchus. A combination of the planisphere and dioptra,
  the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several
  different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy. An astrolabe incorporating a
  mechanical calendar computer[8][9] and gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan,
  Persia in 1235.[10]Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar
  calendar astrolabe,[11] an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine[12] with
  a gear train and gear-wheels,[13]circa 1000 AD.\nThe sector, a calculating instrument
  used for solving problems in proportion, trigonometry, multiplication and division,
  and for various functions, such as squares and cube roots, was developed in the
  late 16th century and found application in gunnery, surveying and navigation.\nThe
  planimeter was a manual instrument to calculate the area of a closed figure by tracing
  over it with a mechanical linkage.\n\n\n\n\nA slide rule\n\n\nThe slide rule was
  invented around 1620–1630, shortly after the publication of the concept of the logarithm.
  It is a hand-operated analog computer for doing multiplication and division. As
  slide rule development progressed, added scales provided reciprocals, squares and
  square roots, cubes and cube roots, as well as transcendental functions such as
  logarithms and exponentials, circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other functions.
  Aviation is one of the few fields where slide rules are still in widespread use,
  particularly for solving time–distance problems in light aircraft. To save space
  and for ease of reading, these are typically circular devices rather than the classic
  linear slide rule shape. A popular example is the E6B.\nIn the 1770s Pierre Jaquet-Droz,
  a Swiss watchmaker, built a mechanical doll (automata) that could write holding
  a quill pen. By switching the number and order of its internal wheels different
  letters, and hence different messages, could be produced. In effect, it could be
  mechanically \"programmed\" to read instructions. Along with two other complex machines,
  the doll is at the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire of Neuchâtel, Switzerland, and still
  operates.[14]\nThe tide-predicting machine invented by Sir William Thomson in 1872
  was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters. It used a system of pulleys
  and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a
  particular location.\nThe differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed
  to solve differential equations by integration, used wheel-and-disc mechanisms to
  perform the integration. In 1876 Lord Kelvin had already discussed the possible
  construction of such calculators, but he had been stymied by the limited output
  torque of the ball-and-disk integrators.[15] In a differential analyzer, the output
  of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output.
  The torque amplifier was the advance that allowed these machines to work. Starting
  in the 1920s, Vannevar Bush and others developed mechanical differential analyzers.\nFirst
  general-purpose computing device\n\n\n\n\nA portion of Babbage's Difference engine.\n\n\nCharles
  Babbage, an English mechanical engineer and polymath, originated the concept of
  a programmable computer. Considered the \"father of the computer\",[16] he conceptualized
  and invented the first mechanical computer in the early 19th century. After working
  on his revolutionary difference engine, designed to aid in navigational calculations,
  in 1833 he realized that a much more general design, an Analytical Engine, was possible.
  The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards,
  a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard
  loom. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell.
  The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later.
  The Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional
  branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose
  computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete.[17][18]\nThe
  machine was about a century ahead of its time. All the parts for his machine had
  to be made by hand — this was a major problem for a device with thousands of parts.
  Eventually, the project was dissolved with the decision of the British Government
  to cease funding. Babbage's failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly
  attributed to difficulties not only of politics and financing, but also to his desire
  to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than
  anyone else could follow. Nevertheless, his son, Henry Babbage, completed a simplified
  version of the analytical engine's computing unit (the mill) in 1888. He gave a
  successful demonstration of its use in computing tables in 1906.\nLater analog computers\n\n\n\n\nSir
  William Thomson's third tide-predicting machine design, 1879–81\n\n\nDuring the
  first half of the 20th century, many scientific computing needs were met by increasingly
  sophisticated analog computers, which used a direct mechanical or electrical model
  of the problem as a basis for computation. However, these were not programmable
  and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers.[19]\nThe
  first modern analog computer was a tide-predicting machine, invented by Sir William
  Thomson in 1872. The differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed
  to solve differential equations by integration using wheel-and-disc mechanisms,
  was conceptualized in 1876 by James Thomson, the brother of the more famous Lord
  Kelvin.[15]\nThe art of mechanical analog computing reached its zenith with the
  differential analyzer, built by H. L. Hazen and Vannevar Bush at MIT starting in
  1927. This built on the mechanical integrators of James Thomson and the torque amplifiers
  invented by H. W. Nieman. A dozen of these devices were built before their obsolescence
  became obvious.\nBy the 1950s the success of digital electronic computers had spelled
  the end for most analog computing machines, but analog computers remain in use in
  some specialized applications such as education (control systems) and aircraft (slide
  rule).\nDigital computer development\nThe principle of the modern computer was first
  described by mathematician and pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing, who set
  out the idea in his seminal 1936 paper,[20]On Computable Numbers. Turing reformulated
  Kurt Gödel's 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's
  universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical
  devices that became known as Turing machines. He proved that some such machine would
  be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable
  as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the Entscheidungsproblem
  by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable: in
  general, it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a given Turing machine
  will ever halt.\nHe also introduced the notion of a 'Universal Machine' (now known
  as a Universal Turing machine), with the idea that such a machine could perform
  the tasks of any other machine, or in other words, it is provably capable of computing
  anything that is computable by executing a program stored on tape, allowing the
  machine to be programmable. Von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of
  the modern computer was due to this paper.[21] Turing machines are to this day a
  central object of study in theory of computation. Except for the limitations imposed
  by their finite memory stores, modern computers are said to be Turing-complete,
  which is to say, they have algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal
  Turing machine.\nElectromechanical\nBy 1938 the United States Navy had developed
  an electromechanical analog computer small enough to use aboard a submarine. This
  was the Torpedo Data Computer, which used trigonometry to solve the problem of firing
  a torpedo at a moving target. During World War II similar devices were developed
  in other countries as well.\n\n\n\n\nReplica of Zuse's Z3, the first fully automatic,
  digital (electromechanical) computer.\n\n\nEarly digital computers were electromechanical;
  electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation. These devices
  had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric
  computers, originally using vacuum tubes. The Z2, created by German engineer Konrad
  Zuse in 1939, was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer.[22]\nIn
  1941, Zuse followed his earlier machine up with the Z3, the world's first working
  electromechanical programmable, fully automatic digital computer.[23][24] The Z3
  was built with 2000 relays, implementing a 22 bit word length that operated at a
  clock frequency of about 5–10 Hz.[25] Program code was supplied on punched film
  while data could be stored in 64 words of memory or supplied from the keyboard.
  It was quite similar to modern machines in some respects, pioneering numerous advances
  such as floating point numbers. Replacement of the hard-to-implement decimal system
  (used in Charles Babbage's earlier design) by the simpler binary system meant that
  Zuse's machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable, given the technologies
  available at that time.[26] The Z3 was Turing complete.[27][28]\nVacuum tubes and
  digital electronic circuits\nPurely electronic circuit elements soon replaced their
  mechanical and electromechanical equivalents, at the same time that digital calculation
  replaced analog. The engineer Tommy Flowers, working at the Post Office Research
  Station in London in the 1930s, began to explore the possible use of electronics
  for the telephone exchange. Experimental equipment that he built in 1934 went into
  operation 5 years later, converting a portion of the telephone exchange network
  into an electronic data processing system, using thousands of vacuum tubes.[19]
  In the US, John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford E. Berry of Iowa State University
  developed and tested the Atanasoff–Berry Computer (ABC) in 1942,[29] the first \"automatic
  electronic digital computer\".[30] This design was also all-electronic and used
  about 300 vacuum tubes, with capacitors fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for
  memory.[31]\n\n\n\n\nColossus was the first electronic digital programmable computing
  device, and was used to break German ciphers during World War II.\n\n\nDuring World
  War II, the British at Bletchley Park achieved a number of successes at breaking
  encrypted German military communications. The German encryption machine, Enigma,
  was first attacked with the help of the electro-mechanical bombes. To crack the
  more sophisticated German Lorenz SZ 40/42 machine, used for high-level Army communications,
  Max Newman and his colleagues commissioned Flowers to build the Colossus.[31] He
  spent eleven months from early February 1943 designing and building the first Colossus.[32]
  After a functional test in December 1943, Colossus was shipped to Bletchley Park,
  where it was delivered on 18 January 1944[33] and attacked its first message on
  5 February.[31]\nColossus was the world's first electronic digital programmable
  computer.[19] It used a large number of valves (vacuum tubes). It had paper-tape
  input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of boolean logical
  operations on its data, but it was not Turing-complete. Nine Mk II Colossi were
  built (The Mk I was converted to a Mk II making ten machines in total). Colossus
  Mark I contained 1500 thermionic valves (tubes), but Mark II with 2400 valves, was
  both 5 times faster and simpler to operate than Mark 1, greatly speeding the decoding
  process.[34][35]\n\n\n\n\nENIAC was the first Turing-complete device, and performed
  ballistics trajectory calculations for the United States Army.\n\n\nThe US-built
  ENIAC[36] (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first electronic
  programmable computer built in the US. Although the ENIAC was similar to the Colossus
  it was much faster and more flexible. It was unambiguously a Turing-complete device
  and could compute any problem that would fit into its memory. Like the Colossus,
  a \"program\" on the ENIAC was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches,
  a far cry from the stored program electronic machines that came later. Once a program
  was written, it had to be mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting
  of plugs and switches.\nIt combined the high speed of electronics with the ability
  to be programmed for many complex problems. It could add or subtract 5000 times
  a second, a thousand times faster than any other machine. It also had modules to
  multiply, divide, and square root. High speed memory was limited to 20 words (about
  80 bytes). Built under the direction of John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert at the
  University of Pennsylvania, ENIAC's development and construction lasted from 1943
  to full operation at the end of 1945. The machine was huge, weighing 30 tons, using
  200 kilowatts of electric power and contained over 18,000 vacuum tubes, 1,500 relays,
  and hundreds of thousands of resistors, capacitors, and inductors.[37]\nStored programs\n\n\n\n\nA
  section of the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine, the first stored-program
  computer.\n\n\nEarly computing machines had fixed programs. Changing its function
  required the re-wiring and re-structuring of the machine.[31] With the proposal
  of the stored-program computer this changed. A stored-program computer includes
  by design an instruction set and can store in memory a set of instructions (a program)
  that details the computation. The theoretical basis for the stored-program computer
  was laid by Alan Turing in his 1936 paper. In 1945 Turing joined the National Physical
  Laboratory and began work on developing an electronic stored-program digital computer.
  His 1945 report ‘Proposed Electronic Calculator’ was the first specification for
  such a device. John von Neumann at the University of Pennsylvania, also circulated
  his First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC in 1945.[19]\n\n\n\n\nFerranti Mark 1,
  c. 1951.\n\n\nThe Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine, nicknamed Baby, was
  the world's first stored-program computer. It was built at the Victoria University
  of Manchester by Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill, and ran its
  first program on 21 June 1948.[38] It was designed as a testbed for the Williams
  tube the first random-access digital storage device.[39] Although the computer was
  considered \"small and primitive\" by the standards of its time, it was the first
  working machine to contain all of the elements essential to a modern electronic
  computer.[40] As soon as the SSEM had demonstrated the feasibility of its design,
  a project was initiated at the university to develop it into a more usable computer,
  the Manchester Mark 1.\nThe Mark 1 in turn quickly became the prototype for the
  Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer.[41]
  Built by Ferranti, it was delivered to the University of Manchester in February
  1951. At least seven of these later machines were delivered between 1953 and 1957,
  one of them to Shell labs in Amsterdam.[42] In October 1947, the directors of British
  catering company J. Lyons & Company decided to take an active role in promoting
  the commercial development of computers. The LEO I computer became operational in
  April 1951 [43] and ran the world's first regular routine office computer job.\nTransistors\n\n\n\n\nA
  bipolar junction transistor\n\n\nThe bipolar transistor was invented in 1947. From
  1955 onwards transistors replaced vacuum tubes in computer designs, giving rise
  to the \"second generation\" of computers. Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors
  have many advantages: they are smaller, and require less power than vacuum tubes,
  so give off less heat. Silicon junction transistors were much more reliable than
  vacuum tubes and had longer, indefinite, service life. Transistorized computers
  could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact
  space.\nAt the University of Manchester, a team under the leadership of Tom Kilburn
  designed and built a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves.[44]
  Their first transistorised computer and the first in the world, was operational
  by 1953, and a second version was completed there in April 1955. However, the machine
  did make use of valves to generate its 125 kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry
  to read and write on its magnetic drum memory, so it was not the first completely
  transistorized computer. That distinction goes to the Harwell CADET of 1955,[45]
  built by the electronics division of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at
  Harwell.[46][47]\nIntegrated circuits\nThe next great advance in computing power
  came with the advent of the integrated circuit. The idea of the integrated circuit
  was first conceived by a radar scientist working for the Royal Radar Establishment
  of the Ministry of Defence, Geoffrey W.A. Dummer. Dummer presented the first public
  description of an integrated circuit at the Symposium on Progress in Quality Electronic
  Components in Washington, D.C. on 7 May 1952.[48]\nThe first practical ICs were
  invented by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor.[49]
  Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in July 1958,
  successfully demonstrating the first working integrated example on 12 September
  1958.[50] In his patent application of 6 February 1959, Kilby described his new
  device as \"a body of semiconductor material ... wherein all the components of the
  electronic circuit are completely integrated\".[51][52] Noyce also came up with
  his own idea of an integrated circuit half a year later than Kilby.[53] His chip
  solved many practical problems that Kilby's had not. Produced at Fairchild Semiconductor,
  it was made of silicon, whereas Kilby's chip was made of germanium.\nThis new development
  heralded an explosion in the commercial and personal use of computers and led to
  the invention of the microprocessor. While the subject of exactly which device was
  the first microprocessor is contentious, partly due to lack of agreement on the
  exact definition of the term \"microprocessor\", it is largely undisputed that the
  first single-chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004,[54] designed and realized by
  Ted Hoff, Federico Faggin, and Stanley Mazor at Intel.[55]\nMobile computers become
  dominant\nWith the continued miniaturization of computing resources, and advancements
  in portable battery life, portable computers grew in popularity in the 2000s.[56]
  The same developments that spurred the growth of laptop computers and other portable
  computers allowed manufacturers to integrate computing resources into cellular phones.
  These so-called smartphones and tablets run on a variety of operating systems and
  have become the dominant computing device on the market, with manufacturers reporting
  having shipped an estimated 237 million devices in 2Q 2013.[57]\nPrograms\nThe defining
  feature of modern computers which distinguishes them from all other machines is
  that they can be programmed. That is to say that some type of instructions (the
  program) can be given to the computer, and it will process them. Modern computers
  based on the von Neumann architecture often have machine code in the form of an
  imperative programming language.\nIn practical terms, a computer program may be
  just a few instructions or extend to many millions of instructions, as do the programs
  for word processors and web browsers for example. A typical modern computer can
  execute billions of instructions per second (gigaflops) and rarely makes a mistake
  over many years of operation. Large computer programs consisting of several million
  instructions may take teams of programmers years to write, and due to the complexity
  of the task almost certainly contain errors.\nStored program architecture\nMain
  articles: Computer program and Computer programming\n\n\n\n\nReplica of the Small-Scale
  Experimental Machine (SSEM), the world's first stored-program computer, at the Museum
  of Science and Industry in Manchester, England\n\n\nThis section applies to most
  common RAM machine-based computers.\nIn most cases, computer instructions are simple:
  add one number to another, move some data from one location to another, send a message
  to some external device, etc. These instructions are read from the computer's memory
  and are generally carried out (executed) in the order they were given. However,
  there are usually specialized instructions to tell the computer to jump ahead or
  backwards to some other place in the program and to carry on executing from there.
  These are called \"jump\" instructions (or branches). Furthermore, jump instructions
  may be made to happen conditionally so that different sequences of instructions
  may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation or some external
  event. Many computers directly support subroutines by providing a type of jump that
  \"remembers\" the location it jumped from and another instruction to return to the
  instruction following that jump instruction.\nProgram execution might be likened
  to reading a book. While a person will normally read each word and line in sequence,
  they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip sections that
  are not of interest. Similarly, a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the
  instructions in some section of the program over and over again until some internal
  condition is met. This is called the flow of control within the program and it is
  what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention.\nComparatively,
  a person using a pocket calculator can perform a basic arithmetic operation such
  as adding two numbers with just a few button presses. But to add together all of
  the numbers from 1 to 1,000 would take thousands of button presses and a lot of
  time, with a near certainty of making a mistake. On the other hand, a computer may
  be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions. The following example
  is written in the MIPS assembly language:\n\n\n\n  begin:\n  addi $8, $0, 0           #
  initialize sum to 0\n  addi $9, $0, 1           # set first number to add = 1\n
  \ loop:\n  slti $10, $9, 1000       # check if the number is less than 1000\n  beq
  $10, $0, finish      # if odd number is greater than n then exit\n  add $8, $8,
  $9           # update sum\n  addi $9, $9, 1           # get next number\n  j loop
  \                  # repeat the summing process\n  finish:\n  add $2, $8, $0           #
  put sum in output register\n\nOnce told to run this program, the computer will perform
  the repetitive addition task without further human intervention. It will almost
  never make a mistake and a modern PC can complete the task in a fraction of a second.\nMachine
  code\nIn most computers, individual instructions are stored as machine code with
  each instruction being given a unique number (its operation code or opcode for short).
  The command to add two numbers together would have one opcode; the command to multiply
  them would have a different opcode, and so on. The simplest computers are able to
  perform any of a handful of different instructions; the more complex computers have
  several hundred to choose from, each with a unique numerical code. Since the computer's
  memory is able to store numbers, it can also store the instruction codes. This leads
  to the important fact that entire programs (which are just lists of these instructions)
  can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside
  the computer in the same way as numeric data. The fundamental concept of storing
  programs in the computer's memory alongside the data they operate on is the crux
  of the von Neumann, or stored program[citation needed], architecture. In some cases,
  a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that is kept separate
  from the data it operates on. This is called the Harvard architecture after the
  Harvard Mark I computer. Modern von Neumann computers display some traits of the
  Harvard architecture in their designs, such as in CPU caches.\nWhile it is possible
  to write computer programs as long lists of numbers (machine language) and while
  this technique was used with many early computers,[58] it is extremely tedious and
  potentially error-prone to do so in practice, especially for complicated programs.
  Instead, each basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative of
  its function and easy to remember – a mnemonic such as ADD, SUB, MULT or JUMP. These
  mnemonics are collectively known as a computer's assembly language. Converting programs
  written in assembly language into something the computer can actually understand
  (machine language) is usually done by a computer program called an assembler.\n\n\n\n\nA
  1970s punched card containing one line from a FORTRAN program. The card reads: \"Z(1)
  = Y + W(1)\" and is labeled \"PROJ039\" for identification purposes.\n\n\nProgramming
  language\nMain article: Programming language\nProgramming languages provide various
  ways of specifying programs for computers to run. Unlike natural languages, programming
  languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and to be concise. They are purely
  written languages and are often difficult to read aloud. They are generally either
  translated into machine code by a compiler or an assembler before being run, or
  translated directly at run time by an interpreter. Sometimes programs are executed
  by a hybrid method of the two techniques.\nLow-level languages\nMain article: Low-level
  programming language\nMachine languages and the assembly languages that represent
  them (collectively termed low-level programming languages) tend to be unique to
  a particular type of computer. For instance, an ARM architecture computer (such
  as may be found in a PDA or a hand-held videogame) cannot understand the machine
  language of an Intel Pentium or the AMD Athlon 64 computer that might be in a PC.[59]\nHigh-level
  languages/Third Generation Language\nMain article: High-level programming language\nThough
  considerably easier than in machine language, writing long programs in assembly
  language is often difficult and is also error prone. Therefore, most practical programs
  are written in more abstract high-level programming languages that are able to express
  the needs of the programmer more conveniently (and thereby help reduce programmer
  error). High level languages are usually \"compiled\" into machine language (or
  sometimes into assembly language and then into machine language) using another computer
  program called a compiler.[60] High level languages are less related to the workings
  of the target computer than assembly language, and more related to the language
  and structure of the problem(s) to be solved by the final program. It is therefore
  often possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level language
  program into the machine language of many different types of computer. This is part
  of the means by which software like video games may be made available for different
  computer architectures such as personal computers and various video game consoles.\nFourth
  Generation Languages\nThese 4G languages are less procedural than 3G languages.
  The benefit of 4GL is that it provides ways to obtain information without requiring
  the direct help of a programmer. Example of 4GL is SQL.\nProgram design\n\n\n\nThis
  section does not cite any references (sources). Please help improve this section
  by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and
  removed. (July 2012)\nProgram design of small programs is relatively simple and
  involves the analysis of the problem, collection of inputs, using the programming
  constructs within languages, devising or using established procedures and algorithms,
  providing data for output devices and solutions to the problem as applicable. As
  problems become larger and more complex, features such as subprograms, modules,
  formal documentation, and new paradigms such as object-oriented programming are
  encountered. Large programs involving thousands of line of code and more require
  formal software methodologies. The task of developing large software systems presents
  a significant intellectual challenge. Producing software with an acceptably high
  reliability within a predictable schedule and budget has historically been difficult;
  the academic and professional discipline of software engineering concentrates specifically
  on this challenge.\nBugs\nMain article: Software bug\n\n\n\n\nThe actual first computer
  bug, a moth found trapped on a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer\n\n\nErrors
  in computer programs are called \"bugs\". They may be benign and not affect the
  usefulness of the program, or have only subtle effects. But in some cases, they
  may cause the program or the entire system to \"hang\", becoming unresponsive to
  input such as mouse clicks or keystrokes, to completely fail, or to crash. Otherwise
  benign bugs may sometimes be harnessed for malicious intent by an unscrupulous user
  writing an exploit, code designed to take advantage of a bug and disrupt a computer's
  proper execution. Bugs are usually not the fault of the computer. Since computers
  merely execute the instructions they are given, bugs are nearly always the result
  of programmer error or an oversight made in the program's design.[61]\nAdmiral Grace
  Hopper, an American computer scientist and developer of the first compiler, is credited
  for having first used the term \"bugs\" in computing after a dead moth was found
  shorting a relay in the Harvard Mark II computer in September 1947.[62]\nComponents\nMain
  articles: Central processing unit and Microprocessor\n\n\nPlay media\n\n\nVideo
  demonstrating the standard components of a \"slimline\" computer\n\n\nA general
  purpose computer has four main components: the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), the
  control unit, the memory, and the input and output devices (collectively termed
  I/O). These parts are interconnected by buses, often made of groups of wires.\nInside
  each of these parts are thousands to trillions of small electrical circuits which
  can be turned off or on by means of an electronic switch. Each circuit represents
  a bit (binary digit) of information so that when the circuit is on it represents
  a \"1\", and when off it represents a \"0\" (in positive logic representation).
  The circuits are arranged in logic gates so that one or more of the circuits may
  control the state of one or more of the other circuits.\nControl unit\nMain articles:
  CPU design and Control unit\n\n\n\n\nDiagram showing how a particular MIPS architecture
  instruction would be decoded by the control system\n\n\nThe control unit (often
  called a control system or central controller) manages the computer's various components;
  it reads and interprets (decodes) the program instructions, transforming them into
  control signals that activate other parts of the computer.[63] Control systems in
  advanced computers may change the order of execution of some instructions to improve
  performance.\nA key component common to all CPUs is the program counter, a special
  memory cell (a register) that keeps track of which location in memory the next instruction
  is to be read from.[64]\nThe control system's function is as follows—note that this
  is a simplified description, and some of these steps may be performed concurrently
  or in a different order depending on the type of CPU:\nRead the code for the next
  instruction from the cell indicated by the program counter.\nDecode the numerical
  code for the instruction into a set of commands or signals for each of the other
  systems.\nIncrement the program counter so it points to the next instruction.\nRead
  whatever data the instruction requires from cells in memory (or perhaps from an
  input device). The location of this required data is typically stored within the
  instruction code.\nProvide the necessary data to an ALU or register.\nIf the instruction
  requires an ALU or specialized hardware to complete, instruct the hardware to perform
  the requested operation.\nWrite the result from the ALU back to a memory location
  or to a register or perhaps an output device.\nJump back to step (1).\nSince the
  program counter is (conceptually) just another set of memory cells, it can be changed
  by calculations done in the ALU. Adding 100 to the program counter would cause the
  next instruction to be read from a place 100 locations further down the program.
  Instructions that modify the program counter are often known as \"jumps\" and allow
  for loops (instructions that are repeated by the computer) and often conditional
  instruction execution (both examples of control flow).\nThe sequence of operations
  that the control unit goes through to process an instruction is in itself like a
  short computer program, and indeed, in some more complex CPU designs, there is another
  yet smaller computer called a microsequencer, which runs a microcode program that
  causes all of these events to happen.\nCentral Processing unit (CPU)\nThe control
  unit, ALU, and registers are collectively known as a central processing unit (CPU).
  Early CPUs were composed of many separate components but since the mid-1970s CPUs
  have typically been constructed on a single integrated circuit called a microprocessor.\nArithmetic
  logic unit (ALU)\nMain article: Arithmetic logic unit\nThe ALU is capable of performing
  two classes of operations: arithmetic and logic.[65]\nThe set of arithmetic operations
  that a particular ALU supports may be limited to addition and subtraction, or might
  include multiplication, division, trigonometry functions such as sine, cosine, etc.,
  and square roots. Some can only operate on whole numbers (integers) whilst others
  use floating point to represent real numbers, albeit with limited precision. However,
  any computer that is capable of performing just the simplest operations can be programmed
  to break down the more complex operations into simple steps that it can perform.
  Therefore, any computer can be programmed to perform any arithmetic operation—although
  it will take more time to do so if its ALU does not directly support the operation.
  An ALU may also compare numbers and return boolean truth values (true or false)
  depending on whether one is equal to, greater than or less than the other (\"is
  64 greater than 65?\").\nLogic operations involve Boolean logic: AND, OR, XOR, and
  NOT. These can be useful for creating complicated conditional statements and processing
  boolean logic.\nSuperscalar computers may contain multiple ALUs, allowing them to
  process several instructions simultaneously.[66]Graphics processors and computers
  with SIMD and MIMD features often contain ALUs that can perform arithmetic on vectors
  and matrices.\nMemory\nMain article: Computer data storage\n\n\n\n\nMagnetic core
  memory was the computer memory of choice throughout the 1960s, until it was replaced
  by semiconductor memory.\n\n\nA computer's memory can be viewed as a list of cells
  into which numbers can be placed or read. Each cell has a numbered \"address\" and
  can store a single number. The computer can be instructed to \"put the number 123
  into the cell numbered 1357\" or to \"add the number that is in cell 1357 to the
  number that is in cell 2468 and put the answer into cell 1595.\" The information
  stored in memory may represent practically anything. Letters, numbers, even computer
  instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease. Since the CPU does not differentiate
  between different types of information, it is the software's responsibility to give
  significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers.\nIn almost
  all modern computers, each memory cell is set up to store binary numbers in groups
  of eight bits (called a byte). Each byte is able to represent 256 different numbers
  (2^8 = 256); either from 0 to 255 or −128 to +127. To store larger numbers, several
  consecutive bytes may be used (typically, two, four or eight). When negative numbers
  are required, they are usually stored in two's complement notation. Other arrangements
  are possible, but are usually not seen outside of specialized applications or historical
  contexts. A computer can store any kind of information in memory if it can be represented
  numerically. Modern computers have billions or even trillions of bytes of memory.\nThe
  CPU contains a special set of memory cells called registers that can be read and
  written to much more rapidly than the main memory area. There are typically between
  two and one hundred registers depending on the type of CPU. Registers are used for
  the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every
  time data is needed. As data is constantly being worked on, reducing the need to
  access main memory (which is often slow compared to the ALU and control units) greatly
  increases the computer's speed.\nComputer main memory comes in two principal varieties:\nrandom-access
  memory or RAM\nread-only memory or ROM\nRAM can be read and written to anytime the
  CPU commands it, but ROM is preloaded with data and software that never changes,
  therefore the CPU can only read from it. ROM is typically used to store the computer's
  initial start-up instructions. In general, the contents of RAM are erased when the
  power to the computer is turned off, but ROM retains its data indefinitely. In a
  PC, the ROM contains a specialized program called the BIOS that orchestrates loading
  the computer's operating system from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer
  is turned on or reset. In embedded computers, which frequently do not have disk
  drives, all of the required software may be stored in ROM. Software stored in ROM
  is often called firmware, because it is notionally more like hardware than software.
  Flash memory blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM, as it retains its data when
  turned off but is also rewritable. It is typically much slower than conventional
  ROM and RAM however, so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is
  unnecessary.[67]\nIn more sophisticated computers there may be one or more RAM cache
  memories, which are slower than registers but faster than main memory. Generally
  computers with this sort of cache are designed to move frequently needed data into
  the cache automatically, often without the need for any intervention on the programmer's
  part.\nInput/output (I/O)\nMain article: Input/output\n\n\n\n\nHard disk drives
  are common storage devices used with computers.\n\n\nI/O is the means by which a
  computer exchanges information with the outside world.[68] Devices that provide
  input or output to the computer are called peripherals.[69] On a typical personal
  computer, peripherals include input devices like the keyboard and mouse, and output
  devices such as the display and printer. Hard disk drives, floppy disk drives and
  optical disc drives serve as both input and output devices. Computer networking
  is another form of I/O.\nI/O devices are often complex computers in their own right,
  with their own CPU and memory. A graphics processing unit might contain fifty or
  more tiny computers that perform the calculations necessary to display 3D graphics.[citation
  needed] Modern desktop computers contain many smaller computers that assist the
  main CPU in performing I/O.\nMultitasking\nMain article: Computer multitasking\nWhile
  a computer may be viewed as running one gigantic program stored in its main memory,
  in some systems it is necessary to give the appearance of running several programs
  simultaneously. This is achieved by multitasking i.e. having the computer switch
  rapidly between running each program in turn.[70]\nOne means by which this is done
  is with a special signal called an interrupt, which can periodically cause the computer
  to stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead. By remembering
  where it was executing prior to the interrupt, the computer can return to that task
  later. If several programs are running \"at the same time\". then the interrupt
  generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second, causing a program
  switch each time. Since modern computers typically execute instructions several
  orders of magnitude faster than human perception, it may appear that many programs
  are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given
  instant. This method of multitasking is sometimes termed \"time-sharing\" since
  each program is allocated a \"slice\" of time in turn.[71]\nBefore the era of cheap
  computers, the principal use for multitasking was to allow many people to share
  the same computer.\nSeemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching
  between several programs to run more slowly, in direct proportion to the number
  of programs it is running, but most programs spend much of their time waiting for
  slow input/output devices to complete their tasks. If a program is waiting for the
  user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take
  a \"time slice\" until the event it is waiting for has occurred. This frees up time
  for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without
  unacceptable speed loss.\nMultiprocessing\nMain article: Multiprocessing\n\n\n\n\nCray
  designed many supercomputers that used multiprocessing heavily.\n\n\nSome computers
  are designed to distribute their work across several CPUs in a multiprocessing configuration,
  a technique once employed only in large and powerful machines such as supercomputers,
  mainframe computers and servers. Multiprocessor and multi-core (multiple CPUs on
  a single integrated circuit) personal and laptop computers are now widely available,
  and are being increasingly used in lower-end markets as a result.\nSupercomputers
  in particular often have highly unique architectures that differ significantly from
  the basic stored-program architecture and from general purpose computers.[72] They
  often feature thousands of CPUs, customized high-speed interconnects, and specialized
  computing hardware. Such designs tend to be useful only for specialized tasks due
  to the large scale of program organization required to successfully utilize most
  of the available resources at once. Supercomputers usually see usage in large-scale
  simulation, graphics rendering, and cryptography applications, as well as with other
  so-called \"embarrassingly parallel\" tasks.\nNetworking and the Internet\nMain
  articles: Computer networking and Internet\n\n\n\n\nVisualization of a portion of
  the routes on the Internet\n\n\nComputers have been used to coordinate information
  between multiple locations since the 1950s. The U.S. military's SAGE system was
  the first large-scale example of such a system, which led to a number of special-purpose
  commercial systems such as Sabre.[73]\nIn the 1970s, computer engineers at research
  institutions throughout the United States began to link their computers together
  using telecommunications technology. The effort was funded by ARPA (now DARPA),
  and the computer network that resulted was called the ARPANET.[74] The technologies
  that made the Arpanet possible spread and evolved.\nIn time, the network spread
  beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the Internet. The
  emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of
  the computer. Computer operating systems and applications were modified to include
  the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network,
  such as peripheral devices, stored information, and the like, as extensions of the
  resources of an individual computer. Initially these facilities were available primarily
  to people working in high-tech environments, but in the 1990s the spread of applications
  like e-mail and the World Wide Web, combined with the development of cheap, fast
  networking technologies like Ethernet and ADSL saw computer networking become almost
  ubiquitous. In fact, the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally.
  A very large proportion of personal computers regularly connect to the Internet
  to communicate and receive information. \"Wireless\" networking, often utilizing
  mobile phone networks, has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous
  even in mobile computing environments.\n\nComputer architecture paradigms\nThere
  are many types of computer architectures:\nQuantum computer vs. Chemical computer\nScalar
  processor vs. Vector processor\nNon-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) computers\nRegister
  machine vs. Stack machine\nHarvard architecture vs. von Neumann architecture\nCellular
  architecture\nOf all these abstract machines, a quantum computer holds the most
  promise for revolutionizing computing.[75]\nLogic gates are a common abstraction
  which can apply to most of the above digital or analog paradigms.\nThe ability to
  store and execute lists of instructions called programs makes computers extremely
  versatile, distinguishing them from calculators. The Church–Turing thesis is a mathematical
  statement of this versatility: any computer with a minimum capability (being Turing-complete)
  is, in principle, capable of performing the same tasks that any other computer can
  perform. Therefore, any type of computer (netbook, supercomputer, cellular automaton,
  etc.) is able to perform the same computational tasks, given enough time and storage
  capacity.\nMisconceptions\nMain articles: Human computer and Harvard Computers\n\n\n\n\nWomen
  as computers in NACA High Speed Flight Station \"Computer Room\"\n\n\nA computer
  does not need to be electronic, nor even have a processor, nor RAM, nor even a hard
  disk. While popular usage of the word \"computer\" is synonymous with a personal
  electronic computer, the modern[76] definition of a computer is literally: \"A device
  that computes, especially a programmable [usually] electronic machine that performs
  high-speed mathematical or logical operations or that assembles, stores, correlates,
  or otherwise processes information.\"[77] Any device which processes information
  qualifies as a computer, especially if the processing is purposeful.[citation needed]\nUnconventional
  computing\nMain article: Unconventional computing\nHistorically, computers evolved
  from mechanical computers and eventually from vacuum tubes to transistors. However,
  conceptually computational systems as flexible as a personal computer can be built
  out of almost anything. For example, a computer can be made out of billiard balls
  (billiard ball computer); an often quoted example.[citation needed] More realistically,
  modern computers are made out of transistors made of photolithographed semiconductors.\nFuture\nThere
  is active research to make computers out of many promising new types of technology,
  such as optical computers, DNA computers, neural computers, and quantum computers.
  Most computers are universal, and are able to calculate any computable function,
  and are limited only by their memory capacity and operating speed. However different
  designs of computers can give very different performance for particular problems;
  for example quantum computers can potentially break some modern encryption algorithms
  (by quantum factoring) very quickly.\nFurther topics\nGlossary of computers\nArtificial

  According to Schmandt-Besserat 1981, these clay containers contained tokens, the
  total of which were the count of objects being transferred. The containers thus
  served as something of a bill of lading or an accounts book. In order to avoid breaking
  open the containers, first, clay impressions of the tokens were placed on the outside
  of the containers, for the count; the shapes of the impressions were abstracted
  into stylized marks; finally, the abstract marks were systematically used as numerals;
  these numerals were finally formalized as numbers. Eventually (Schmandt-Besserat
  estimates it took 4000 years[dead link]) the marks on the outside of the containers
  were all that were needed to convey the count, and the clay containers evolved into
  clay tablets with marks for the count.\n^ Robson, Eleanor (2008), Mathematics in

  were commonly programmed directly in machine code. Some minicomputers like the DEC
  PDP-8 could be programmed directly from a panel of switches. However, this method
  was usually used only as part of the booting process. Most modern computers boot
  entirely automatically by reading a boot program from some non-volatile memory.\n^
  However, there is sometimes some form of machine language compatibility between
  different computers. An x86-64 compatible microprocessor like the AMD Athlon 64
  is able to run most of the same programs that an Intel Core 2 microprocessor can,
  as well as programs designed for earlier microprocessors like the Intel Pentiums
  and Intel 80486. This contrasts with very early commercial computers, which were
  often one-of-a-kind and totally incompatible with other computers.\n^ High level
  languages are also often interpreted rather than compiled. Interpreted languages
  are translated into machine code on the fly, while running, by another program called
  an interpreter.\n^ It is not universally true that bugs are solely due to programmer
  oversight. Computer hardware may fail or may itself have a fundamental problem that
  produces unexpected results in certain situations. For instance, the Pentium FDIV
  bug caused some Intel microprocessors in the early 1990s to produce inaccurate results
  for certain floating point division operations. This was caused by a flaw in the
  microprocessor design and resulted in a partial recall of the affected devices.\n^

  Retrieved 17 February 2007.  (subscription required)\n^ The control unit's role
  in interpreting instructions has varied somewhat in the past. Although the control
  unit is solely responsible for instruction interpretation in most modern computers,
  this is not always the case. Some computers have instructions that are partially
  interpreted by the control unit with further interpretation performed by another
  device. For example, EDVAC, one of the earliest stored-program computers, used a
  central control unit that only interpreted four instructions. All of the arithmetic-related
  instructions were passed on to its arithmetic unit and further decoded there.\n^
  Instructions often occupy more than one memory address, therefore the program counter
  usually increases by the number of memory locations required to store one instruction.\n^

  /* @nomin */\n} );A computer is a general-purpose device that can be programmed
  to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Since a sequence
  of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind
  of problem.Conventionally, a computer consists of at least one processing element,
  typically a central processing unit (CPU), and some form of memory. The processing
  element carries out arithmetic and logic operations, and a sequencing and control
  unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral
  devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source, and the result
  of operations saved and retrieved.Mechanical analog computers started appearing
  in the first century and were later used in the medieval era for astronomical calculations.
  In World War II, mechanical analog computers were used for specialized military
  applications such as calculating torpedo aiming. During this time the first electronic
  digital computers were developed. Originally they were the size of a large room,
  consuming as much power as several hundred modern personal computers (PCs).[1]Modern
  computers based on integrated circuits are millions to billions of times more capable
  than the early machines, and occupy a fraction of the space.[2] Computers are small
  enough to fit into mobile devices, and mobile computers can be powered by small
  batteries. Personal computers in their various forms are icons of the Information
  Age and are generally considered as \"computers\". However, the embedded computers
  found in many devices from MP3 players to fighter aircraft and from electronic toys
  to industrial robots are the most numerous.The first known use of the word \"computer\"
  was in 1613 in a book called The Yong Mans Gleanings by English writer Richard Braithwait:
  \"I haue read the truest computer of Times, and the best Arithmetician that euer
  breathed, and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number.\" It referred to a person
  who carried out calculations, or computations. The word continued with the same
  meaning until the middle of the 20th century. From the end of the 19th century the
  word began to take on its more familiar meaning, a machine that carries out computations.[3]Devices
  have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, mostly using one-to-one
  correspondence with fingers. The earliest counting device was probably a form of
  tally stick. Later record keeping aids throughout the Fertile Crescent included
  calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably
  livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers.[4][5] The use of
  counting rods is one example.The abacus was initially used for arithmetic tasks.
  The Roman abacus was used in Babylonia as early as 2400 BC. Since then, many other
  forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented. In a medieval European counting
  house, a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on
  it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money.The Antikythera
  mechanism is believed to be the earliest mechanical analog \"computer\", according
  to Derek J. de Solla Price.[6] It was designed to calculate astronomical positions.
  It was discovered in 1901 in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera,
  between Kythera and Crete, and has been dated to circa 100 BC. Devices of a level
  of complexity comparable to that of the Antikythera mechanism would not reappear
  until a thousand years later.Many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement
  were constructed for astronomical and navigation use. The planisphere was a star
  chart invented by Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī in the early 11th century.[7] The astrolabe
  was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and
  is often attributed to Hipparchus. A combination of the planisphere and dioptra,
  the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several
  different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy. An astrolabe incorporating a
  mechanical calendar computer[8][9] and gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan,
  Persia in 1235.[10]Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar
  calendar astrolabe,[11] an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine[12] with
  a gear train and gear-wheels,[13]circa 1000 AD.The sector, a calculating instrument
  used for solving problems in proportion, trigonometry, multiplication and division,
  and for various functions, such as squares and cube roots, was developed in the
  late 16th century and found application in gunnery, surveying and navigation.The
  planimeter was a manual instrument to calculate the area of a closed figure by tracing
  over it with a mechanical linkage.The slide rule was invented around 1620–1630,
  shortly after the publication of the concept of the logarithm. It is a hand-operated
  analog computer for doing multiplication and division. As slide rule development
  progressed, added scales provided reciprocals, squares and square roots, cubes and
  cube roots, as well as transcendental functions such as logarithms and exponentials,
  circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other functions. Aviation is one of the
  few fields where slide rules are still in widespread use, particularly for solving
  time–distance problems in light aircraft. To save space and for ease of reading,
  these are typically circular devices rather than the classic linear slide rule shape.
  A popular example is the E6B.In the 1770s Pierre Jaquet-Droz, a Swiss watchmaker,
  built a mechanical doll (automata) that could write holding a quill pen. By switching
  the number and order of its internal wheels different letters, and hence different
  messages, could be produced. In effect, it could be mechanically \"programmed\"
  to read instructions. Along with two other complex machines, the doll is at the
  Musée d'Art et d'Histoire of Neuchâtel, Switzerland, and still operates.[14]The
  tide-predicting machine invented by Sir William Thomson in 1872 was of great utility
  to navigation in shallow waters. It used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically
  calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location.The differential
  analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations
  by integration, used wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration. In 1876
  Lord Kelvin had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators,
  but he had been stymied by the limited output torque of the ball-and-disk integrators.[15]
  In a differential analyzer, the output of one integrator drove the input of the
  next integrator, or a graphing output. The torque amplifier was the advance that
  allowed these machines to work. Starting in the 1920s, Vannevar Bush and others
  developed mechanical differential analyzers.Charles Babbage, an English mechanical
  engineer and polymath, originated the concept of a programmable computer. Considered
  the \"father of the computer\",[16] he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical
  computer in the early 19th century. After working on his revolutionary difference
  engine, designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a
  much more general design, an Analytical Engine, was possible. The input of programs
  and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used
  at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom. For output, the
  machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also
  be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated
  an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and
  loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer
  that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete.[17][18]The machine was
  about a century ahead of its time. All the parts for his machine had to be made
  by hand — this was a major problem for a device with thousands of parts. Eventually,
  the project was dissolved with the decision of the British Government to cease funding.
  Babbage's failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to
  difficulties not only of politics and financing, but also to his desire to develop
  an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else
  could follow. Nevertheless, his son, Henry Babbage, completed a simplified version
  of the analytical engine's computing unit (the mill) in 1888. He gave a successful
  demonstration of its use in computing tables in 1906.During the first half of the
  20th century, many scientific computing needs were met by increasingly sophisticated
  analog computers, which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem
  as a basis for computation. However, these were not programmable and generally lacked
  the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers.[19]The first modern analog
  computer was a tide-predicting machine, invented by Sir William Thomson in 1872.
  The differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential
  equations by integration using wheel-and-disc mechanisms, was conceptualized in
  1876 by James Thomson, the brother of the more famous Lord Kelvin.[15]The art of
  mechanical analog computing reached its zenith with the differential analyzer, built
  by H. L. Hazen and Vannevar Bush at MIT starting in 1927. This built on the mechanical
  integrators of James Thomson and the torque amplifiers invented by H. W. Nieman.
  A dozen of these devices were built before their obsolescence became obvious.By
  the 1950s the success of digital electronic computers had spelled the end for most
  analog computing machines, but analog computers remain in use in some specialized
  applications such as education (control systems) and aircraft (slide rule).The principle
  of the modern computer was first described by mathematician and pioneering computer
  scientist Alan Turing, who set out the idea in his seminal 1936 paper,[20]On Computable
  Numbers. Turing reformulated Kurt Gödel's 1931 results on the limits of proof and
  computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the
  formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. He
  proved that some such machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical
  computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there
  was no solution to the Entscheidungsproblem by first showing that the halting problem
  for Turing machines is undecidable: in general, it is not possible to decide algorithmically
  whether a given Turing machine will ever halt.He also introduced the notion of a
  'Universal Machine' (now known as a Universal Turing machine), with the idea that
  such a machine could perform the tasks of any other machine, or in other words,
  it is provably capable of computing anything that is computable by executing a program
  stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable. Von Neumann acknowledged
  that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper.[21] Turing
  machines are to this day a central object of study in theory of computation. Except
  for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores, modern computers are
  said to be Turing-complete, which is to say, they have algorithm execution capability
  equivalent to a universal Turing machine.By 1938 the United States Navy had developed
  an electromechanical analog computer small enough to use aboard a submarine. This
  was the Torpedo Data Computer, which used trigonometry to solve the problem of firing
  a torpedo at a moving target. During World War II similar devices were developed
  in other countries as well.Early digital computers were electromechanical; electric
  switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation. These devices had a
  low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers,
  originally using vacuum tubes. The Z2, created by German engineer Konrad Zuse in
  1939, was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer.[22]In
  1941, Zuse followed his earlier machine up with the Z3, the world's first working
  electromechanical programmable, fully automatic digital computer.[23][24] The Z3
  was built with 2000 relays, implementing a 22 bit word length that operated at a
  clock frequency of about 5–10 Hz.[25] Program code was supplied on punched film
  while data could be stored in 64 words of memory or supplied from the keyboard.
  It was quite similar to modern machines in some respects, pioneering numerous advances
  such as floating point numbers. Replacement of the hard-to-implement decimal system
  (used in Charles Babbage's earlier design) by the simpler binary system meant that
  Zuse's machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable, given the technologies
  available at that time.[26] The Z3 was Turing complete.[27][28]Purely electronic
  circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents,
  at the same time that digital calculation replaced analog. The engineer Tommy Flowers,
  working at the Post Office Research Station in London in the 1930s, began to explore
  the possible use of electronics for the telephone exchange. Experimental equipment
  that he built in 1934 went into operation 5 years later, converting a portion of
  the telephone exchange network into an electronic data processing system, using
  thousands of vacuum tubes.[19] In the US, John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford E.
  Berry of Iowa State University developed and tested the Atanasoff–Berry Computer
  (ABC) in 1942,[29] the first \"automatic electronic digital computer\".[30] This
  design was also all-electronic and used about 300 vacuum tubes, with capacitors
  fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for memory.[31]During World War II, the British
  at Bletchley Park achieved a number of successes at breaking encrypted German military
  communications. The German encryption machine, Enigma, was first attacked with the
  help of the electro-mechanical bombes. To crack the more sophisticated German Lorenz
  SZ 40/42 machine, used for high-level Army communications, Max Newman and his colleagues
  commissioned Flowers to build the Colossus.[31] He spent eleven months from early
  February 1943 designing and building the first Colossus.[32] After a functional
  test in December 1943, Colossus was shipped to Bletchley Park, where it was delivered
  on 18 January 1944[33] and attacked its first message on 5 February.[31]Colossus
  was the world's first electronic digital programmable computer.[19] It used a large
  number of valves (vacuum tubes). It had paper-tape input and was capable of being
  configured to perform a variety of boolean logical operations on its data, but it
  was not Turing-complete. Nine Mk II Colossi were built (The Mk I was converted to
  a Mk II making ten machines in total). Colossus Mark I contained 1500 thermionic
  valves (tubes), but Mark II with 2400 valves, was both 5 times faster and simpler
  to operate than Mark 1, greatly speeding the decoding process.[34][35]The US-built
  ENIAC[36] (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first electronic
  programmable computer built in the US. Although the ENIAC was similar to the Colossus
  it was much faster and more flexible. It was unambiguously a Turing-complete device
  and could compute any problem that would fit into its memory. Like the Colossus,
  a \"program\" on the ENIAC was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches,
  a far cry from the stored program electronic machines that came later. Once a program
  was written, it had to be mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting
  of plugs and switches.It combined the high speed of electronics with the ability
  to be programmed for many complex problems. It could add or subtract 5000 times
  a second, a thousand times faster than any other machine. It also had modules to
  multiply, divide, and square root. High speed memory was limited to 20 words (about
  80 bytes). Built under the direction of John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert at the
  University of Pennsylvania, ENIAC's development and construction lasted from 1943
  to full operation at the end of 1945. The machine was huge, weighing 30 tons, using
  200 kilowatts of electric power and contained over 18,000 vacuum tubes, 1,500 relays,
  and hundreds of thousands of resistors, capacitors, and inductors.[37]Early computing
  machines had fixed programs. Changing its function required the re-wiring and re-structuring
  of the machine.[31] With the proposal of the stored-program computer this changed.
  A stored-program computer includes by design an instruction set and can store in
  memory a set of instructions (a program) that details the computation. The theoretical
  basis for the stored-program computer was laid by Alan Turing in his 1936 paper.
  In 1945 Turing joined the National Physical Laboratory and began work on developing
  an electronic stored-program digital computer. His 1945 report ‘Proposed Electronic
  Calculator’ was the first specification for such a device. John von Neumann at the
  University of Pennsylvania, also circulated his First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC
  in 1945.[19]The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine, nicknamed Baby, was
  the world's first stored-program computer. It was built at the Victoria University
  of Manchester by Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill, and ran its
  first program on 21 June 1948.[38] It was designed as a testbed for the Williams
  tube the first random-access digital storage device.[39] Although the computer was
  considered \"small and primitive\" by the standards of its time, it was the first
  working machine to contain all of the elements essential to a modern electronic
  computer.[40] As soon as the SSEM had demonstrated the feasibility of its design,
  a project was initiated at the university to develop it into a more usable computer,
  the Manchester Mark 1.The Mark 1 in turn quickly became the prototype for the Ferranti
  Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer.[41] Built
  by Ferranti, it was delivered to the University of Manchester in February 1951.
  At least seven of these later machines were delivered between 1953 and 1957, one
  of them to Shell labs in Amsterdam.[42] In October 1947, the directors of British
  catering company J. Lyons & Company decided to take an active role in promoting
  the commercial development of computers. The LEO I computer became operational in
  April 1951 [43] and ran the world's first regular routine office computer job.The
  bipolar transistor was invented in 1947. From 1955 onwards transistors replaced
  vacuum tubes in computer designs, giving rise to the \"second generation\" of computers.
  Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors have many advantages: they are smaller, and
  require less power than vacuum tubes, so give off less heat. Silicon junction transistors
  were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer, indefinite, service life.
  Transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits
  in a relatively compact space.At the University of Manchester, a team under the
  leadership of Tom Kilburn designed and built a machine using the newly developed
  transistors instead of valves.[44] Their first transistorised computer and the first
  in the world, was operational by 1953, and a second version was completed there
  in April 1955. However, the machine did make use of valves to generate its 125 kHz
  clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic drum memory,
  so it was not the first completely transistorized computer. That distinction goes
  to the Harwell CADET of 1955,[45] built by the electronics division of the Atomic
  Energy Research Establishment at Harwell.[46][47]The next great advance in computing
  power came with the advent of the integrated circuit. The idea of the integrated
  circuit was first conceived by a radar scientist working for the Royal Radar Establishment
  of the Ministry of Defence, Geoffrey W.A. Dummer. Dummer presented the first public
  description of an integrated circuit at the Symposium on Progress in Quality Electronic
  Components in Washington, D.C. on 7 May 1952.[48]The first practical ICs were invented
  by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor.[49]
  Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in July 1958,
  successfully demonstrating the first working integrated example on 12 September
  1958.[50] In his patent application of 6 February 1959, Kilby described his new
  device as \"a body of semiconductor material ... wherein all the components of the
  electronic circuit are completely integrated\".[51][52] Noyce also came up with
  his own idea of an integrated circuit half a year later than Kilby.[53] His chip
  solved many practical problems that Kilby's had not. Produced at Fairchild Semiconductor,
  it was made of silicon, whereas Kilby's chip was made of germanium.This new development
  heralded an explosion in the commercial and personal use of computers and led to
  the invention of the microprocessor. While the subject of exactly which device was
  the first microprocessor is contentious, partly due to lack of agreement on the
  exact definition of the term \"microprocessor\", it is largely undisputed that the
  first single-chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004,[54] designed and realized by
  Ted Hoff, Federico Faggin, and Stanley Mazor at Intel.[55]With the continued miniaturization
  of computing resources, and advancements in portable battery life, portable computers
  grew in popularity in the 2000s.[56] The same developments that spurred the growth
  of laptop computers and other portable computers allowed manufacturers to integrate
  computing resources into cellular phones. These so-called smartphones and tablets
  run on a variety of operating systems and have become the dominant computing device
  on the market, with manufacturers reporting having shipped an estimated 237 million
  devices in 2Q 2013.[57]The defining feature of modern computers which distinguishes
  them from all other machines is that they can be programmed. That is to say that
  some type of instructions (the program) can be given to the computer, and it will
  process them. Modern computers based on the von Neumann architecture often have
  machine code in the form of an imperative programming language.In practical terms,
  a computer program may be just a few instructions or extend to many millions of
  instructions, as do the programs for word processors and web browsers for example.
  A typical modern computer can execute billions of instructions per second (gigaflops)
  and rarely makes a mistake over many years of operation. Large computer programs
  consisting of several million instructions may take teams of programmers years to
  write, and due to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors.This
  section applies to most common RAM machine-based computers.In most cases, computer
  instructions are simple: add one number to another, move some data from one location
  to another, send a message to some external device, etc. These instructions are
  read from the computer's memory and are generally carried out (executed) in the
  order they were given. However, there are usually specialized instructions to tell
  the computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in the program and to
  carry on executing from there. These are called \"jump\" instructions (or branches).
  Furthermore, jump instructions may be made to happen conditionally so that different
  sequences of instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation
  or some external event. Many computers directly support subroutines by providing
  a type of jump that \"remembers\" the location it jumped from and another instruction
  to return to the instruction following that jump instruction.Program execution might
  be likened to reading a book. While a person will normally read each word and line
  in sequence, they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip
  sections that are not of interest. Similarly, a computer may sometimes go back and
  repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again until
  some internal condition is met. This is called the flow of control within the program
  and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention.Comparatively,
  a person using a pocket calculator can perform a basic arithmetic operation such
  as adding two numbers with just a few button presses. But to add together all of
  the numbers from 1 to 1,000 would take thousands of button presses and a lot of
  time, with a near certainty of making a mistake. On the other hand, a computer may
  be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions. The following example
  is written in the MIPS assembly language:Once told to run this program, the computer
  will perform the repetitive addition task without further human intervention. It
  will almost never make a mistake and a modern PC can complete the task in a fraction
  of a second.In most computers, individual instructions are stored as machine code
  with each instruction being given a unique number (its operation code or opcode
  for short). The command to add two numbers together would have one opcode; the command
  to multiply them would have a different opcode, and so on. The simplest computers
  are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions; the more complex
  computers have several hundred to choose from, each with a unique numerical code.
  Since the computer's memory is able to store numbers, it can also store the instruction
  codes. This leads to the important fact that entire programs (which are just lists
  of these instructions) can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves
  be manipulated inside the computer in the same way as numeric data. The fundamental
  concept of storing programs in the computer's memory alongside the data they operate
  on is the crux of the von Neumann, or stored program[citation needed], architecture.
  In some cases, a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that
  is kept separate from the data it operates on. This is called the Harvard architecture
  after the Harvard Mark I computer. Modern von Neumann computers display some traits
  of the Harvard architecture in their designs, such as in CPU caches.While it is
  possible to write computer programs as long lists of numbers (machine language)
  and while this technique was used with many early computers,[58] it is extremely
  tedious and potentially error-prone to do so in practice, especially for complicated
  programs. Instead, each basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative
  of its function and easy to remember – a mnemonic such as ADD, SUB, MULT or JUMP.
  These mnemonics are collectively known as a computer's assembly language. Converting
  programs written in assembly language into something the computer can actually understand
  (machine language) is usually done by a computer program called an assembler.Programming
  languages provide various ways of specifying programs for computers to run. Unlike
  natural languages, programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and
  to be concise. They are purely written languages and are often difficult to read
  aloud. They are generally either translated into machine code by a compiler or an
  assembler before being run, or translated directly at run time by an interpreter.
  Sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques.Machine
  languages and the assembly languages that represent them (collectively termed low-level
  programming languages) tend to be unique to a particular type of computer. For instance,
  an ARM architecture computer (such as may be found in a PDA or a hand-held videogame)
  cannot understand the machine language of an Intel Pentium or the AMD Athlon 64
  computer that might be in a PC.[59]Though considerably easier than in machine language,
  writing long programs in assembly language is often difficult and is also error
  prone. Therefore, most practical programs are written in more abstract high-level
  programming languages that are able to express the needs of the programmer more
  conveniently (and thereby help reduce programmer error). High level languages are
  usually \"compiled\" into machine language (or sometimes into assembly language
  and then into machine language) using another computer program called a compiler.[60]
  High level languages are less related to the workings of the target computer than
  assembly language, and more related to the language and structure of the problem(s)
  to be solved by the final program. It is therefore often possible to use different
  compilers to translate the same high level language program into the machine language
  of many different types of computer. This is part of the means by which software
  like video games may be made available for different computer architectures such
  as personal computers and various video game consoles.These 4G languages are less
  procedural than 3G languages. The benefit of 4GL is that it provides ways to obtain
  information without requiring the direct help of a programmer. Example of 4GL is
  SQL.Program design of small programs is relatively simple and involves the analysis
  of the problem, collection of inputs, using the programming constructs within languages,
  devising or using established procedures and algorithms, providing data for output
  devices and solutions to the problem as applicable. As problems become larger and
  more complex, features such as subprograms, modules, formal documentation, and new
  paradigms such as object-oriented programming are encountered. Large programs involving
  thousands of line of code and more require formal software methodologies. The task
  of developing large software systems presents a significant intellectual challenge.
  Producing software with an acceptably high reliability within a predictable schedule
  and budget has historically been difficult; the academic and professional discipline
  of software engineering concentrates specifically on this challenge.Errors in computer
  programs are called \"bugs\". They may be benign and not affect the usefulness of
  the program, or have only subtle effects. But in some cases, they may cause the
  program or the entire system to \"hang\", becoming unresponsive to input such as
  mouse clicks or keystrokes, to completely fail, or to crash. Otherwise benign bugs
  may sometimes be harnessed for malicious intent by an unscrupulous user writing
  an exploit, code designed to take advantage of a bug and disrupt a computer's proper
  execution. Bugs are usually not the fault of the computer. Since computers merely
  execute the instructions they are given, bugs are nearly always the result of programmer
  error or an oversight made in the program's design.[61]Admiral Grace Hopper, an
  American computer scientist and developer of the first compiler, is credited for
  having first used the term \"bugs\" in computing after a dead moth was found shorting
  a relay in the Harvard Mark II computer in September 1947.[62]A general purpose
  computer has four main components: the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), the control
  unit, the memory, and the input and output devices (collectively termed I/O). These
  parts are interconnected by buses, often made of groups of wires.Inside each of
  these parts are thousands to trillions of small electrical circuits which can be
  turned off or on by means of an electronic switch. Each circuit represents a bit
  (binary digit) of information so that when the circuit is on it represents a \"1\",
  and when off it represents a \"0\" (in positive logic representation). The circuits
  are arranged in logic gates so that one or more of the circuits may control the
  state of one or more of the other circuits.The control unit (often called a control
  system or central controller) manages the computer's various components; it reads
  and interprets (decodes) the program instructions, transforming them into control
  signals that activate other parts of the computer.[63] Control systems in advanced
  computers may change the order of execution of some instructions to improve performance.A
  key component common to all CPUs is the program counter, a special memory cell (a
  register) that keeps track of which location in memory the next instruction is to
  be read from.[64]The control system's function is as follows—note that this is a
  simplified description, and some of these steps may be performed concurrently or
  in a different order depending on the type of CPU:Since the program counter is (conceptually)
  just another set of memory cells, it can be changed by calculations done in the
  ALU. Adding 100 to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read
  from a place 100 locations further down the program. Instructions that modify the
  program counter are often known as \"jumps\" and allow for loops (instructions that
  are repeated by the computer) and often conditional instruction execution (both
  examples of control flow).The sequence of operations that the control unit goes
  through to process an instruction is in itself like a short computer program, and
  indeed, in some more complex CPU designs, there is another yet smaller computer
  called a microsequencer, which runs a microcode program that causes all of these
  events to happen.The control unit, ALU, and registers are collectively known as
  a central processing unit (CPU). Early CPUs were composed of many separate components
  but since the mid-1970s CPUs have typically been constructed on a single integrated
  circuit called a microprocessor.The ALU is capable of performing two classes of
  operations: arithmetic and logic.[65]The set of arithmetic operations that a particular
  ALU supports may be limited to addition and subtraction, or might include multiplication,
  division, trigonometry functions such as sine, cosine, etc., and square roots. Some
  can only operate on whole numbers (integers) whilst others use floating point to
  represent real numbers, albeit with limited precision. However, any computer that
  is capable of performing just the simplest operations can be programmed to break
  down the more complex operations into simple steps that it can perform. Therefore,
  any computer can be programmed to perform any arithmetic operation—although it will
  take more time to do so if its ALU does not directly support the operation. An ALU
  may also compare numbers and return boolean truth values (true or false) depending
  on whether one is equal to, greater than or less than the other (\"is 64 greater
  than 65?\").Logic operations involve Boolean logic: AND, OR, XOR, and NOT. These
  can be useful for creating complicated conditional statements and processing boolean
  logic.Superscalar computers may contain multiple ALUs, allowing them to process
  several instructions simultaneously.[66]Graphics processors and computers with SIMD
  and MIMD features often contain ALUs that can perform arithmetic on vectors and
  matrices.A computer's memory can be viewed as a list of cells into which numbers
  can be placed or read. Each cell has a numbered \"address\" and can store a single
  number. The computer can be instructed to \"put the number 123 into the cell numbered
  1357\" or to \"add the number that is in cell 1357 to the number that is in cell
  2468 and put the answer into cell 1595.\" The information stored in memory may represent
  practically anything. Letters, numbers, even computer instructions can be placed
  into memory with equal ease. Since the CPU does not differentiate between different
  types of information, it is the software's responsibility to give significance to
  what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers.In almost all modern computers,
  each memory cell is set up to store binary numbers in groups of eight bits (called
  a byte). Each byte is able to represent 256 different numbers (2^8 = 256); either
  from 0 to 255 or −128 to +127. To store larger numbers, several consecutive bytes
  may be used (typically, two, four or eight). When negative numbers are required,
  they are usually stored in two's complement notation. Other arrangements are possible,
  but are usually not seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts.
  A computer can store any kind of information in memory if it can be represented
  numerically. Modern computers have billions or even trillions of bytes of memory.The
  CPU contains a special set of memory cells called registers that can be read and
  written to much more rapidly than the main memory area. There are typically between
  two and one hundred registers depending on the type of CPU. Registers are used for
  the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every
  time data is needed. As data is constantly being worked on, reducing the need to
  access main memory (which is often slow compared to the ALU and control units) greatly
  increases the computer's speed.Computer main memory comes in two principal varieties:RAM
  can be read and written to anytime the CPU commands it, but ROM is preloaded with
  data and software that never changes, therefore the CPU can only read from it. ROM
  is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions. In general,
  the contents of RAM are erased when the power to the computer is turned off, but
  ROM retains its data indefinitely. In a PC, the ROM contains a specialized program
  called the BIOS that orchestrates loading the computer's operating system from the
  hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset. In embedded
  computers, which frequently do not have disk drives, all of the required software
  may be stored in ROM. Software stored in ROM is often called firmware, because it
  is notionally more like hardware than software. Flash memory blurs the distinction
  between ROM and RAM, as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable.
  It is typically much slower than conventional ROM and RAM however, so its use is
  restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary.[67]In more sophisticated
  computers there may be one or more RAM cache memories, which are slower than registers
  but faster than main memory. Generally computers with this sort of cache are designed
  to move frequently needed data into the cache automatically, often without the need
  for any intervention on the programmer's part.I/O is the means by which a computer
  exchanges information with the outside world.[68] Devices that provide input or
  output to the computer are called peripherals.[69] On a typical personal computer,
  peripherals include input devices like the keyboard and mouse, and output devices
  such as the display and printer. Hard disk drives, floppy disk drives and optical
  disc drives serve as both input and output devices. Computer networking is another
  form of I/O.I/O devices are often complex computers in their own right, with their
  own CPU and memory. A graphics processing unit might contain fifty or more tiny
  computers that perform the calculations necessary to display 3D graphics.[citation
  needed] Modern desktop computers contain many smaller computers that assist the
  main CPU in performing I/O.While a computer may be viewed as running one gigantic
  program stored in its main memory, in some systems it is necessary to give the appearance
  of running several programs simultaneously. This is achieved by multitasking i.e.
  having the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn.[70]One
  means by which this is done is with a special signal called an interrupt, which
  can periodically cause the computer to stop executing instructions where it was
  and do something else instead. By remembering where it was executing prior to the
  interrupt, the computer can return to that task later. If several programs are running
  \"at the same time\". then the interrupt generator might be causing several hundred
  interrupts per second, causing a program switch each time. Since modern computers
  typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception,
  it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one
  is ever executing in any given instant. This method of multitasking is sometimes
  termed \"time-sharing\" since each program is allocated a \"slice\" of time in turn.[71]Before
  the era of cheap computers, the principal use for multitasking was to allow many
  people to share the same computer.Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer
  that is switching between several programs to run more slowly, in direct proportion
  to the number of programs it is running, but most programs spend much of their time
  waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks. If a program is waiting
  for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will
  not take a \"time slice\" until the event it is waiting for has occurred. This frees
  up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously
  without unacceptable speed loss.Some computers are designed to distribute their
  work across several CPUs in a multiprocessing configuration, a technique once employed
  only in large and powerful machines such as supercomputers, mainframe computers
  and servers. Multiprocessor and multi-core (multiple CPUs on a single integrated
  circuit) personal and laptop computers are now widely available, and are being increasingly
  used in lower-end markets as a result.Supercomputers in particular often have highly
  unique architectures that differ significantly from the basic stored-program architecture
  and from general purpose computers.[72] They often feature thousands of CPUs, customized
  high-speed interconnects, and specialized computing hardware. Such designs tend
  to be useful only for specialized tasks due to the large scale of program organization
  required to successfully utilize most of the available resources at once. Supercomputers
  usually see usage in large-scale simulation, graphics rendering, and cryptography
  applications, as well as with other so-called \"embarrassingly parallel\" tasks.Computers
  have been used to coordinate information between multiple locations since the 1950s.
  The U.S. military's SAGE system was the first large-scale example of such a system,
  which led to a number of special-purpose commercial systems such as Sabre.[73]In
  the 1970s, computer engineers at research institutions throughout the United States
  began to link their computers together using telecommunications technology. The
  effort was funded by ARPA (now DARPA), and the computer network that resulted was
  called the ARPANET.[74] The technologies that made the Arpanet possible spread and
  evolved.In time, the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and
  became known as the Internet. The emergence of networking involved a redefinition
  of the nature and boundaries of the computer. Computer operating systems and applications
  were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other
  computers on the network, such as peripheral devices, stored information, and the
  like, as extensions of the resources of an individual computer. Initially these
  facilities were available primarily to people working in high-tech environments,
  but in the 1990s the spread of applications like e-mail and the World Wide Web,
  combined with the development of cheap, fast networking technologies like Ethernet
  and ADSL saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous. In fact, the number of
  computers that are networked is growing phenomenally. A very large proportion of
  personal computers regularly connect to the Internet to communicate and receive
  information. \"Wireless\" networking, often utilizing mobile phone networks, has
  meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments.There
  are many types of computer architectures:Of all these abstract machines, a quantum
  computer holds the most promise for revolutionizing computing.[75]Logic gates are
  a common abstraction which can apply to most of the above digital or analog paradigms.The
  ability to store and execute lists of instructions called programs makes computers
  extremely versatile, distinguishing them from calculators. The Church–Turing thesis
  is a mathematical statement of this versatility: any computer with a minimum capability
  (being Turing-complete) is, in principle, capable of performing the same tasks that
  any other computer can perform. Therefore, any type of computer (netbook, supercomputer,
  cellular automaton, etc.) is able to perform the same computational tasks, given
  enough time and storage capacity.A computer does not need to be electronic, nor
  even have a processor, nor RAM, nor even a hard disk. While popular usage of the
  word \"computer\" is synonymous with a personal electronic computer, the modern[76]
  definition of a computer is literally: \"A device that computes, especially a programmable
  [usually] electronic machine that performs high-speed mathematical or logical operations
  or that assembles, stores, correlates, or otherwise processes information.\"[77]
  Any device which processes information qualifies as a computer, especially if the
  processing is purposeful.[citation needed]Historically, computers evolved from mechanical
  computers and eventually from vacuum tubes to transistors. However, conceptually
  computational systems as flexible as a personal computer can be built out of almost
  anything. For example, a computer can be made out of billiard balls (billiard ball
  computer); an often quoted example.[citation needed] More realistically, modern
  computers are made out of transistors made of photolithographed semiconductors.There
  is active research to make computers out of many promising new types of technology,
  such as optical computers, DNA computers, neural computers, and quantum computers.
  Most computers are universal, and are able to calculate any computable function,
  and are limited only by their memory capacity and operating speed. However different
  designs of computers can give very different performance for particular problems;
  for example quantum computers can potentially break some modern encryption algorithms
  (by quantum factoring) very quickly.A computer will solve problems in exactly the
  way it is programmed to, without regard to efficiency, alternative solutions, possible
  shortcuts, or possible errors in the code. Computer programs that learn and adapt
  are part of the emerging field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.The
  term hardware covers all of those parts of a computer that are tangible objects.
  Circuits, displays, power supplies, cables, keyboards, printers and mice are all
  hardware.Software refers to parts of the computer which do not have a material form,
  such as programs, data, protocols, etc. When software is stored in hardware that
  cannot easily be modified (such as BIOS ROM in an IBM PC compatible), it is sometimes
  called \"firmware\".There are thousands of different programming languages—some
  intended to be general purpose, others useful only for highly specialized applications.Firmware
  is the technology which has the combination of both hardware and software such as
  BIOS chip inside a computer. This chip (hardware) is located on the motherboard
  and has the BIOS set up (software) stored in it.Computers are typically classified
  based on their uses:When unprocessed data is sent to the computer with the help
  of input devices, the data is processed and sent to output devices. The input devices
  may be hand-operated or automated. The act of processing is mainly regulated by
  the CPU. Some examples of hand-operated input devices are:The means through which
  computer gives output are known as output devices. Some examples of output devices
  are:As the use of computers has spread throughout society, there are an increasing
  number of careers involving computers.The need for computers to work well together
  and to be able to exchange information has spawned the need for many standards organizations,
  clubs and societies of both a formal and informal nature.Wikiversity has a quiz
