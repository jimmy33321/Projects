Glad we can help.NerdWallet: Thanks, AT! You're best off with a Visa or MasterCard - we usually recommend the Capital One Venture as it has one of the best rewards rates in the business at 2 miles per $1 spent. It has no foreign transaction fee, and it's a Visa, so you're in the clear to use it in Australia.NerdWallet: I'd suggest the Capital One Venture, because you can use your miles against any travel expense - you aren't tied to a single airline program, or even to award flights at all. Moreover, it has no foreign transaction fee, so you won't be charged extra when you spend money abroad.NerdWallet: Thanks, Travis! Glad to hear we can help, and great tip on calling up the card issuer to switch between MC and Visa.

  The NerdsNerdWallet: Hey Joel-

  We value Hilton HHonors points at 0.5 cents each, versus the typical 1 cent each, because the redemption rates are, well, not quite the best. Ditto for Marriott points - they went down in value from about 1 cent per point to just 0.8 cents apiece because of the lower redemption rates.NerdWallet: If you're interested in earning points, you're probably better off with the Capital One Venture Rewards, which earns 2 miles per $1 on every purchase. The Amex charge cards are known more for their perks (like airport lounge access or airline incidental credits) than for great rewards.NerdWallet: Hey there-
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  I'd double check to see if the 3x points on gas, groceries and drugstores is a limited time deal (for example, you get those rewards only in the first 6 months) or whether those rewards last throughout the life of the card. Those kind of great-rewards-short-lifespan deals are fairly common, but usually not a good idea.NerdWallet: Corey's got it - you'll have to combine points to get there. Your best bet is probably to get the United MileagePlus Explorer and use the signup bonus to book one leg of the journey, and also get the Chase Sapphire Preferred and redeem your Ultimate Rewards Points for a ticket to cover the rest of the journey. That way, your Ultimate Rewards Points stretch farther, as they're worth 25% more when used for travel booked through the Chase portal.NerdWallet: Hi Mary,

  Chase is currently revamping the Southwest credit card - it comes and goes periodically, so check back soon!Mary Anne: I am genuinely surprised to not see the Southwest Rapid Rewards Visa listed, especially since you can actually accrue enough points to earn an annual free companion pass.  Why is this card not rated in the mix?Corey: 12k miles on any credit card is not enough to get you to India.  What you could do is sign up for the Chase Sapphire Preferred card and the United Explorer MileagePlus card  sign-up bonuses to get the 80k miles needed for a roundtrip US-India ticket.  40k from the CSP + 30k from the United card + 12k from spending = 82k.  There is also a 50k offer for the United card floating around that you should be able to get.HealthyTurtle: Thinking about making a big purchase (~12K) on a credit card and then using bonus points/purchase points for travel from US to India in December. Any recommendations?Guest: I was just offered Signature Visa (black) Concierge Services card today by my bank, Wells Fargo.  It's a one time offer (so they say).  There is not an annual fee, 0 interest for 12 months on purchases and balance transfer.  3 points on gas, groceries and drugstores and one point on everything else.  Should I get it?  I presently have Capital One Venture which I get 1.25 points on everything.  It sound too good of an offer.  please advice.  Thank youDave: I'm trying to decide between Amex Preferred Rewards Gold and the Amex Platinum card. Just interested in earning points to redeem for domestic flights.  Will use the card for all purchases.  Any thoughts?NerdWallet: Hi Student Traveler,

- "An EMV card is a great choice for travelling abroad â€“ they are indeed more secure
  than the average credit card, thanks to the EMV chip. \n"
- |2+

- |
  Every time you make a transaction and swipe your card, with or without an EMV chip, the point of sales terminal reads your cardâ€™s PIN or code, sent over by your cardâ€™s magnetic strip. With just that strip â€“ and without an EMV chip â€“ the cardâ€™s coding is static â€“ itâ€™s replicable. Meanwhile, with an EMV chip, unique code is generated with each transaction, which means itâ€™s much harder to access your account. Thereâ€™s that, and the fact that most EMV transactions require a PIN â€“ canâ€™t forge that!
- |2+

- |
  Now, onto a specific card recommendation. Itâ€™s true that options are a little limited this side of the
- "pond â€“ EMV is way bigger in Europe â€“ but there are a couple cards out there.
  \n"
- |2+

- |
  Most, unfortunately, will charge an annual fee, and theyâ€™re not necessarily catered to students, like
- |
  yourself â€“ but you can work around both those problems with the <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/Chase-British-Airways">British Airways Visa Signature card</a>.
- |2+

- |
  First, that annual fee: The British Airways card may charge you $95 every year, but itâ€™s easy to earn that cash back with the signup bonus and rewards. Spend $1,000 in the first 3 months
- |
  â€“ something thatâ€™s not terribly difficult as a student abroad â€“ and youâ€™ll get back 50,000 Avios. Those are British Airwaysâ€™ points, and theyâ€™re each worth 1 cent, which means you get back $50 within the first 3 months of carrying the card. Youâ€™ll also earn as you spend, with 1.25 Avios for every $1 on all purchases and 2.5 Avios on every $1 of British Airways purchases.
- |2+

- |
  The only catch: these Avios are redeemable for flights with British Airways, and, when youâ€™re back in the States, on American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, and LAN. In other words, for this cardâ€™s rewards to catch your eye, youâ€™ll want to travel with British Airways abroad or youâ€™ll want to book a domestic flight when youâ€™re back Stateside.
- |2+

- |
  Second, as we already mentioned, these cards arenâ€™t catered toward students, which means application approval is a little tougher for you. To seal the deal, youâ€™ll need a parent to
- |
  co-sign. Assuming theyâ€™ve taken out loans or have an active credit card, your parent will have credit history to prove to your lenders that youâ€™re worth the risk with this credit card.
- |2+

- |
  If youâ€™re not looking for travel rewards and want something more basic, check out the <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/State-Department-Federal-Credit-Union-Platinum">State Department Federal Credit Union Platinum card</a>. There may not be many perks and the rewards may be thin, at 1 Flexpoint per dollar spent, but thereâ€™s no foreign transaction fee, annual fee or balance transfer fee.

  Nerdwallet updated its valuation of the recently devalued hotel reward programs
  such as Hilton and Marriott? I expect that it would change the ranking of those
  cards.Travis Meyer: Hi, Great Site! I used your specs to narrow down my next card
  to the Chase Sapphire and wanted to add some info I came across. I was confused
  as to whether the Sapphire was a Visa or Mastercard. A yahoo answer post said that
  you can choose during the application processes, but in my experience this didn't
  happen. After getting approved, I still wasn't told what kind of card it was. This
  was important because I have a SAMs club mebership that doesn't use Visa, only Mastercard/Discover,
  so I called Chase, and they said the card was a VISA, but that I can switch to Mastercard.
  So I did over the phone. Hope this helps future applicants!Jennifer Viera: Hi! Great
  Blog here! I'm looking for a card in which I can transfer my miles/points to any
  airline on a ratio of 1:1. I like the Discover Miles card, but its not accepted
  in many places. I travel to Europe.. so I'm looking for that card. CAustralian Traveler:
  I'm looking for a credit card for my travels to Australia next year.  I currently
  have a MasterCard and I'm fairly certain I can use that over in Australia just fine,
  but will be subject to the 3% foreign transaction fee.  I checked out your list
  of top credit cards with no foreign transaction fees (which is awesome by the way!)
  but I've heard from others that the only credit cards that are accepted in Australia
  are Visa or MasterCard.  Would you have any knowledge on this subject/know what
  the best credit card for the fewest fees for Australia would be?cottageme.com: This
  is so cool..thanks so much for the info. Love it!Alan : I will go to Japan next

  do I get points for the miles I fly on Southwest plus purchases.Jam: I am not sure,
  but it feels to me that there is one angle of analysis that you guys don't have
  which I would like very much. All these travels cards seem to be of the type where
  you spend money on \"other things\" and gain points to use on flights. What I am
  really interested in and what I can't find a good resource on is a travel card that
  is the best for the money you actually spend on Travel. There are sliders for amount
  of money spent on gas/grocery/dining and then other. I would be interested which
  cards would be the best if you had a travel section in addition to those above categories.
  I would love to be able to max travel and zero out the others and see what cards
  pop up.Rachel:  I was wondering if you could help me with my particular situation.
  I've just finished school and am shopping around for a milage-based credit card.
  I often from from New York to California, Latin America, and India. Personally,
  I've always preferred flying Virgin or JetBlue in the US, international flights
  I don't have a prefrence for. Would it be better to go with an airline card or is
  there a better option out there for me?student traveler: I am a student traveling

  I will use the card abroad in Western Europe. I am thinking I need one with EMV

  transaction fees? Which one should I choose?Jholland99: What happens if u get a
  card and don't spend that amout within the 3 months.. u don't get the bonus then
  what? Monkeycajones: There must also be a distinction between whether the points
  can be used to book travel (which appears to be through the credit cards travel
  agency), or whether one can actually transfer their points to a frequent flier account.
  \ I am interested in transferring points into frequent flier programs.  Would you
  please clarify which cards permit transfer of points to the major airlines; and
  which airlines?Monkeycajones: Thank you for your site because I love to find all
  those great deals.  I am surprised that you have not addressed the problem of which
  airlines one can transfer their points to.  Chase will say that you can transfer
  to \"20 major airlines\" but when I called them, it only included BA, SWA and United
  for major US airlines.  I have a Diners Club card that was wonderful until they
  decided to stop transfers to American Airlines.  \n"

- "So I'm looking for a card that I can transfer the points most major airlines -
  such as Delta, AA, BA and US Airways.  Do you know which cards will do this?  I
  believe all the Chase cards won't do this.  It looks like the Starwood is the only
  one that I can see from your info.  And it would be fabulous if you would include
  this info with your reviews.  Maybe just one article on this subject would be an
  eye-opener for most people.  NerdWallet: You can use the British Airways card's

  Where can I confirm this? ThanksTaiwanTim: What about the Citi Platinum Select.  It has a $95 fee but I can get 35K bonus points with $1.5K in spend within first 3 months.  The 35K miles appear to be directly translatable into a OneWorld economy ticket to Taiwan (not sure if it is one-way or round-trip).  With upcoming expenses that will easily exceed $1.5K it seems I can sign up, garner the points and translate directly into a ticket to Taiwan.  Am I missing some fine print? meme: Sadly British Airways doesn't have any direct flights from LAX to TPE. Otherwise this would have been a great deal.TaiwanTim: I live in the U.S. but travel to Asia at least once per year (non-business related).  Which card provides the best mileage rewards to translate my domestic spending into an international ticket or at least reduce the cost of my international ticketNerdWallet: Hey, thanks for the feedback! The Spark Miles/Cash is one of the best options for a small business, since it gives a 2% rewards rate on all purchases, so you don't have to deal with rotating categories. Alaska, on the other hand, pays out in Alaska Airlines miles, which is quite restrictive. It also has a lower rewards rate.itsajelly: So I'm struggling on deciding which card to attempt to sign up for.  new small business will have close to $100000 in equip to purchase, and then about 3500 a month after that.  Want to travel with my wife and staff with card bonus.  Front page suggests spark miles for business, but when I fill out little slider questionnaire it is no where to be found as a suggestion for small business.  Alaska Air services here in the NW, should I go with that?  Confused and want to make a good decision.  Awesome site and thanks for the help.Marian Moss: My first time on you website; looks like it is really helpful.  ThanksNerdWallet: Maxim,

  To get the full value of your bonus, you'll need to book the expense through the Chase Ultimate Rewards website. The 50,000-points will get you a $500 credit towards your purchase. When you book through Chase, they refund 20% of the points back to your account. In this case, that means another $100 to put toward travel. When you use that $100, you'll receive another $20 back, then another $4, then $0.80, and so it goes, shrinking infinitely. The immediate value of the bonus will grant you $500. The 20% point refunds make up the other $125.

  You probably won't have to pay income tax on the signing bonus, though it's not outside the realm of possibility. The IRS is now taxing bonuses that exceed a perceived worth of $600, but the Sapphire's immediate value is only $500 with the other $125 coming manifesting through refunds. We haven't heard any reports of cardholders paying income tax on the Sapphire bonus. We're thinking you'll probably be okay.Maxim12: I have 2 questions:
- |
  1)Do I have to  change 50,000 points of Chase Sapphire to aa, delta, or united miles, then buy the airline ticket from those airlines? Or just buy the ticket the pay the ticket by points Or redeem the 50000 pointsx2.5 cents=$625.00 cash and use that money to buy the ticket?

  2) Do I have to pay income tax for $625 promo bonus?

  NerdWallet: Thanks for letting us know! We'll fix the image.Jdebach: The Virgin Atlantic Card which earns 1.5 miles/$1 spent is actually the Black Card, not the White Card, which is featured in the image above.  The White Card earns 1 miles/$1.  Nerd Wallet... can the image be updated?  The link to "Apply Now' is correct, as it goes to the Black Card application.  NerdWallet: The US Bank FlexPerks isn't a terrible card, but you can do a lot better in terms of rewards. It earns 2 points per $1 on groceries, airlines and gas and 1 point per $1 spent elsewhere, and pays out in FlexPoints.
- |2+

- "One of the major limitations of the FlexPerks card is that you get your best rewards
  value only if you use your points to book travel through US Bank. The problem with
  that is you can't take advantage of discount sites like Kayak, so you probably won't
  get the best deal. It also charges a foreign transaction fee of 3%, which is prohibitively
  high for a traveler. \n"
- |
  The FlexPerks falls short in ease of use and foreign transaction fees, but has a decent rewards rate and lower annual fees than some other travel cards. If you tend to travel in style - airport lounges, business/first class, etc. - the American Express Platinum has a very high annual fee, but makes up for is in travel-related benefits. Another option if you tend to splurge on hotels is the Starwood American Express ($65 annual fee, waived the first year). We think it gives a value of 2-5% back on all purchases if you redeem for Starwood hotel stays, and it gives a flat value of 1.25% back on all purchases if you redeem for airline miles with its partners. While the Platinum waives its foreign transaction fee, the Starwood does not.

  The NerdsNerdWallet: Hey Joel-

  We value Hilton HHonors points at 0.5 cents each, versus the typical 1 cent each, because the redemption rates are, well, not quite the best. Ditto for Marriott points - they went down in value from about 1 cent per point to just 0.8 cents apiece because of the lower redemption rates.NerdWallet: If you're interested in earning points, you're probably better off with the Capital One Venture Rewards, which earns 2 miles per $1 on every purchase. The Amex charge cards are known more for their perks (like airport lounge access or airline incidental credits) than for great rewards.NerdWallet: Hey there-
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  I'd double check to see if the 3x points on gas, groceries and drugstores is a limited time deal (for example, you get those rewards only in the first 6 months) or whether those rewards last throughout the life of the card. Those kind of great-rewards-short-lifespan deals are fairly common, but usually not a good idea.NerdWallet: Corey's got it - you'll have to combine points to get there. Your best bet is probably to get the United MileagePlus Explorer and use the signup bonus to book one leg of the journey, and also get the Chase Sapphire Preferred and redeem your Ultimate Rewards Points for a ticket to cover the rest of the journey. That way, your Ultimate Rewards Points stretch farther, as they're worth 25% more when used for travel booked through the Chase portal.NerdWallet: Hi Mary,

  Chase is currently revamping the Southwest credit card - it comes and goes periodically, so check back soon!Mary Anne: I am genuinely surprised to not see the Southwest Rapid Rewards Visa listed, especially since you can actually accrue enough points to earn an annual free companion pass.  Why is this card not rated in the mix?Corey: 12k miles on any credit card is not enough to get you to India.  What you could do is sign up for the Chase Sapphire Preferred card and the United Explorer MileagePlus card  sign-up bonuses to get the 80k miles needed for a roundtrip US-India ticket.  40k from the CSP + 30k from the United card + 12k from spending = 82k.  There is also a 50k offer for the United card floating around that you should be able to get.HealthyTurtle: Thinking about making a big purchase (~12K) on a credit card and then using bonus points/purchase points for travel from US to India in December. Any recommendations?Guest: I was just offered Signature Visa (black) Concierge Services card today by my bank, Wells Fargo.  It's a one time offer (so they say).  There is not an annual fee, 0 interest for 12 months on purchases and balance transfer.  3 points on gas, groceries and drugstores and one point on everything else.  Should I get it?  I presently have Capital One Venture which I get 1.25 points on everything.  It sound too good of an offer.  please advice.

- "An EMV card is a great choice for travelling abroad â€“ they are indeed more secure
  than the average credit card, thanks to the EMV chip. \n"
- |2+

- |
  Every time you make a transaction and swipe your card, with or without an EMV chip, the point of sales terminal reads your cardâ€™s PIN or code, sent over by your cardâ€™s magnetic strip. With just that strip â€“ and without an EMV chip â€“ the cardâ€™s coding is static â€“ itâ€™s replicable. Meanwhile, with an EMV chip, unique code is generated with each transaction, which means itâ€™s much harder to access your account. Thereâ€™s that, and the fact that most EMV transactions require a PIN â€“ canâ€™t forge that!
- |2+

- |
  Now, onto a specific card recommendation. Itâ€™s true that options are a little limited this side of the
- "pond â€“ EMV is way bigger in Europe â€“ but there are a couple cards out there.
  \n"
- |2+

- |
  Most, unfortunately, will charge an annual fee, and theyâ€™re not necessarily catered to students, like
- |
  yourself â€“ but you can work around both those problems with the <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/Chase-British-Airways">British Airways Visa Signature card</a>.
- |2+

- |
  First, that annual fee: The British Airways card may charge you $95 every year, but itâ€™s easy to earn that cash back with the signup bonus and rewards. Spend $1,000 in the first 3 months
- |
  â€“ something thatâ€™s not terribly difficult as a student abroad â€“ and youâ€™ll get back 50,000 Avios. Those are British Airwaysâ€™ points, and theyâ€™re each worth 1 cent, which means you get back $50 within the first 3 months of carrying the card. Youâ€™ll also earn as you spend, with 1.25 Avios for every $1 on all purchases and 2.5 Avios on every $1 of British Airways purchases.
- |2+

- |
  The only catch: these Avios are redeemable for flights with British Airways, and, when youâ€™re back in the States, on American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, and LAN. In other words, for this cardâ€™s rewards to catch your eye, youâ€™ll want to travel with British Airways abroad or youâ€™ll want to book a domestic flight when youâ€™re back Stateside.
- |2+

- |
  Second, as we already mentioned, these cards arenâ€™t catered toward students, which means application approval is a little tougher for you. To seal the deal, youâ€™ll need a parent to
- |
  co-sign. Assuming theyâ€™ve taken out loans or have an active credit card, your parent will have credit history to prove to your lenders that youâ€™re worth the risk with this credit card.
- |2+

- |
  If youâ€™re not looking for travel rewards and want something more basic, check out the <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/State-Department-Federal-Credit-Union-Platinum">State Department Federal Credit Union Platinum card</a>. There may not be many perks and the rewards may be thin, at 1 Flexpoint per dollar spent, but thereâ€™s no foreign transaction fee, annual fee or balance transfer fee.

  such as Delta, AA, BA and US Airways.  Do you know which cards will do this?  I
  believe all the Chase cards won't do this.  It looks like the Starwood is the only
  one that I can see from your info.  And it would be fabulous if you would include
  this info with your reviews.  Maybe just one article on this subject would be an
  eye-opener for most people.  NerdWallet: You can use the British Airways card's
  Avios (their point system) for American Airlines tickets, and right now they're
  offering a 100,000-mile bonus: http://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/Chase-British-Airways
  \n"
- "The downside is that you have to spend $20,000 in a year to get the full bonus.
  Alternatively, the Chase Sapphire Preferred offers 40,000 bonus points, worth $500
  of travel booked through Chase: http://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/Chase-Sapphire-Preferred
  \n"
- "The AAdvantage cards have decent bonuses. The best is from the Citi AAdvantage
  MasterCard, with 30,000 miles and no first-year fee: http://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/Citibank-Gold-AAdvantage-World-MasterCardDsnolan4:
  I would like a Citibank Amer a/l advantage c/c. Are there any great deals out right
  now? Or is it best to wait for one in the mail. I know I have gotten offers for
  45,000 points in the past.Alvaro: \"Pro tip: Virgin Atlantic credit card. Virgin

  Where can I confirm this? ThanksTaiwanTim: What about the Citi Platinum Select.  It has a $95 fee but I can get 35K bonus points with $1.5K in spend within first 3 months.  The 35K miles appear to be directly translatable into a OneWorld economy ticket to Taiwan (not sure if it is one-way or round-trip).  With upcoming expenses that will easily exceed $1.5K it seems I can sign up, garner the points and translate directly into a ticket to Taiwan.  Am I missing some fine print? meme: Sadly British Airways doesn't have any direct flights from LAX to TPE. Otherwise this would have been a great deal.TaiwanTim: I live in the U.S. but travel to Asia at least once per year (non-business related).  Which card provides the best mileage rewards to translate my domestic spending into an international ticket or at least reduce the cost of my international ticketNerdWallet: Hey, thanks for the feedback! The Spark Miles/Cash is one of the best options for a small business, since it gives a 2% rewards rate on all purchases, so you don't have to deal with rotating categories. Alaska, on the other hand, pays out in Alaska Airlines miles, which is quite restrictive. It also has a lower rewards rate.itsajelly: So I'm struggling on deciding which card to attempt to sign up for.  new small business will have close to $100000 in equip to purchase, and then about 3500 a month after that.  Want to travel with my wife and staff with card bonus.  Front page suggests spark miles for business, but when I fill out little slider questionnaire it is no where to be found as a suggestion for small business.  Alaska Air services here in the NW, should I go with that?  Confused and want to make a good decision.  Awesome site and thanks for the help.Marian Moss: My first time on you website; looks like it is really helpful.  ThanksNerdWallet: Maxim,

  To get the full value of your bonus, you'll need to book the expense through the Chase Ultimate Rewards website. The 50,000-points will get you a $500 credit towards your purchase. When you book through Chase, they refund 20% of the points back to your account. In this case, that means another $100 to put toward travel. When you use that $100, you'll receive another $20 back, then another $4, then $0.80, and so it goes, shrinking infinitely. The immediate value of the bonus will grant you $500. The 20% point refunds make up the other $125.

  You probably won't have to pay income tax on the signing bonus, though it's not outside the realm of possibility. The IRS is now taxing bonuses that exceed a perceived worth of $600, but the Sapphire's immediate value is only $500 with the other $125 coming manifesting through refunds. We haven't heard any reports of cardholders paying income tax on the Sapphire bonus. We're thinking you'll probably be okay.Maxim12: I have 2 questions:
- |
  1)Do I have to  change 50,000 points of Chase Sapphire to aa, delta, or united miles, then buy the airline ticket from those airlines? Or just buy the ticket the pay the ticket by points Or redeem the 50000 pointsx2.5 cents=$625.00 cash and use that money to buy the ticket?
- |
  2) Do I have to pay income tax for $625 promo bonus?

  Thanks,

  NerdWallet: Thanks for letting us know! We'll fix the image.Jdebach: The Virgin Atlantic Card which earns 1.5 miles/$1 spent is actually the Black Card, not the White Card, which is featured in the image above.  The White Card earns 1 miles/$1.  Nerd Wallet... can the image be updated?  The link to "Apply Now' is correct, as it goes to the Black Card application.  NerdWallet: The US Bank FlexPerks isn't a terrible card, but you can do a lot better in terms of rewards. It earns 2 points per $1 on groceries, airlines and gas and 1 point per $1 spent elsewhere, and pays out in FlexPoints.
- |2+

- "One of the major limitations of the FlexPerks card is that you get your best rewards
  value only if you use your points to book travel through US Bank. The problem with
  that is you can't take advantage of discount sites like Kayak, so you probably won't
  get the best deal. It also charges a foreign transaction fee of 3%, which is prohibitively
  high for a traveler. \n"
- |
  The FlexPerks falls short in ease of use and foreign transaction fees, but has a decent rewards rate and lower annual fees than some other travel cards. If you tend to travel in style - airport lounges, business/first class, etc. - the American Express Platinum has a very high annual fee, but makes up for is in travel-related benefits. Another option if you tend to splurge on hotels is the Starwood American Express ($65 annual fee, waived the first year). We think it gives a value of 2-5% back on all purchases if you redeem for Starwood hotel stays, and it gives a flat value of 1.25% back on all purchases if you redeem for airline miles with its partners. While the Platinum waives its foreign transaction fee, the Starwood does not.

Mastercard falls under citi forwardMoney card: I  would  have to say that the citibank american airlines is just as good a credit card as chase continental.

  I have seen quite a few people use citi at stores personal card.

  where as chase continental I haven't seen anybody use this card. I'm sure while eating out during the week , checking in at hotels people have used this card. But not at Bj's or other stores.Money card: nerd has somethings wrong.NerdWallet: Try this:  http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/2011/credit-card-no-foreign-transaction-fee/Eric: seaching for Mastercard or discover card, with flying points and without foreign transaction feesNerdWallet: Hi Leslie!

  Thanks! Glad we can help.NerdWallet: Thanks, AT! You're best off with a Visa or
  MasterCard - we usually recommend the Capital One Venture as it has one of the best
  rewards rates in the business at 2 miles per $1 spent. It has no foreign transaction
  fee, and it's a Visa, so you're in the clear to use it in Australia.NerdWallet:
  I'd suggest the Capital One Venture, because you can use your miles against any
  travel expense - you aren't tied to a single airline program, or even to award flights
  at all. Moreover, it has no foreign transaction fee, so you won't be charged extra
  when you spend money abroad.NerdWallet: Thanks, Travis! Glad to hear we can help,
  and great tip on calling up the card issuer to switch between MC and Visa.\n\n\nCheers,\nThe
  NerdsNerdWallet: Hey Joel-\n\nWe value Hilton HHonors points at 0.5 cents each,
  versus the typical 1 cent each, because the redemption rates are, well, not quite
  the best. Ditto for Marriott points - they went down in value from about 1 cent
  per point to just 0.8 cents apiece because of the lower redemption rates.NerdWallet:
  If you're interested in earning points, you're probably better off with the Capital
  One Venture Rewards, which earns 2 miles per $1 on every purchase. The Amex charge
  cards are known more for their perks (like airport lounge access or airline incidental
  credits) than for great rewards.NerdWallet: Hey there-\n\n\nI'd double check to
  see if the 3x points on gas, groceries and drugstores is a limited time deal (for
  example, you get those rewards only in the first 6 months) or whether those rewards
  last throughout the life of the card. Those kind of great-rewards-short-lifespan
  deals are fairly common, but usually not a good idea.NerdWallet: Corey's got it
  - you'll have to combine points to get there. Your best bet is probably to get the
  United MileagePlus Explorer and use the signup bonus to book one leg of the journey,

  since you can actually accrue enough points to earn an annual free companion pass.
  \ Why is this card not rated in the mix?Corey: 12k miles on any credit card is not
  enough to get you to India.  What you could do is sign up for the Chase Sapphire
  Preferred card and the United Explorer MileagePlus card  sign-up bonuses to get
  the 80k miles needed for a roundtrip US-India ticket.  40k from the CSP + 30k from
  the United card + 12k from spending = 82k.  There is also a 50k offer for the United
  card floating around that you should be able to get.HealthyTurtle: Thinking about

  Fargo.  It's a one time offer (so they say).  There is not an annual fee, 0 interest

  Hi Student Traveler,\n\nAn EMV card is a great choice for travelling abroad â€“
  they are indeed more secure than the average credit card, thanks to the EMV chip.
  \n\nEvery time you make a transaction and swipe your card, with or without an EMV
  chip, the point of sales terminal reads your cardâ€™s PIN or code, sent over by
  your cardâ€™s magnetic strip. With just that strip â€“ and without an EMV chip â€“
  the cardâ€™s coding is static â€“ itâ€™s replicable. Meanwhile, with an EMV chip,
  unique code is generated with each transaction, which means itâ€™s much harder to
  access your account. Thereâ€™s that, and the fact that most EMV transactions require
  a PIN â€“ canâ€™t forge that!\n\nNow, onto a specific card recommendation. Itâ€™s
  true that options are a little limited this side of the\npond â€“ EMV is way bigger
  in Europe â€“ but there are a couple cards out there. \n\nMost, unfortunately, will
  charge an annual fee, and theyâ€™re not necessarily catered to students, like\nyourself
  â€“ but you can work around both those problems with the <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/Chase-British-Airways\">British
  Airways Visa Signature card</a>.\n\nFirst, that annual fee: The British Airways
  card may charge you $95 every year, but itâ€™s easy to earn that cash back with
  the signup bonus and rewards. Spend $1,000 in the first 3 months\nâ€“ something
  thatâ€™s not terribly difficult as a student abroad â€“ and youâ€™ll get back 50,000
  Avios. Those are British Airwaysâ€™ points, and theyâ€™re each worth 1 cent, which
  means you get back $50 within the first 3 months of carrying the card. Youâ€™ll
  also earn as you spend, with 1.25 Avios for every $1 on all purchases and 2.5 Avios
  on every $1 of British Airways purchases.\n\nThe only catch: these Avios are redeemable
  for flights with British Airways, and, when youâ€™re back in the States, on American
  Airlines, Cathay Pacific, and LAN. In other words, for this cardâ€™s rewards to
  catch your eye, youâ€™ll want to travel with British Airways abroad or youâ€™ll
  want to book a domestic flight when youâ€™re back Stateside.\n\nSecond, as we already
  mentioned, these cards arenâ€™t catered toward students, which means application
  approval is a little tougher for you. To seal the deal, youâ€™ll need a parent to\nco-sign.
  Assuming theyâ€™ve taken out loans or have an active credit card, your parent will
  have credit history to prove to your lenders that youâ€™re worth the risk with this
  credit card.\n\nIf youâ€™re not looking for travel rewards and want something more
  basic, check out the <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/State-Department-Federal-Credit-Union-Platinum\">State
  Department Federal Credit Union Platinum card</a>. There may not be many perks and
  the rewards may be thin, at 1 Flexpoint per dollar spent, but thereâ€™s no foreign
  transaction fee, annual fee or balance transfer fee.\n\nHope this helps! Let us
  know if you have any further questions.Joel Solon: Has Nerdwallet updated its valuation
  of the recently devalued hotel reward programs such as Hilton and Marriott? I expect
  that it would change the ranking of those cards.Travis Meyer: Hi, Great Site! I
  used your specs to narrow down my next card to the Chase Sapphire and wanted to
  add some info I came across. I was confused as to whether the Sapphire was a Visa
  or Mastercard. A yahoo answer post said that you can choose during the application
  processes, but in my experience this didn't happen. After getting approved, I still
  wasn't told what kind of card it was. This was important because I have a SAMs club
  mebership that doesn't use Visa, only Mastercard/Discover, so I called Chase, and
  they said the card was a VISA, but that I can switch to Mastercard. So I did over
  the phone. Hope this helps future applicants!Jennifer Viera: Hi! Great Blog here!
  I'm looking for a card in which I can transfer my miles/points to any airline on
  a ratio of 1:1. I like the Discover Miles card, but its not accepted in many places.
  I travel to Europe.. so I'm looking for that card. CAustralian Traveler: I'm looking
  for a credit card for my travels to Australia next year.  I currently have a MasterCard
  and I'm fairly certain I can use that over in Australia just fine, but will be subject
  to the 3% foreign transaction fee.  I checked out your list of top credit cards
  with no foreign transaction fees (which is awesome by the way!) but I've heard from
  others that the only credit cards that are accepted in Australia are Visa or MasterCard.
  \ Would you have any knowledge on this subject/know what the best credit card for
  the fewest fees for Australia would be?cottageme.com: This is so cool..thanks so
  much for the info. Love it!Alan : I will go to Japan next month, possibly on United.
  I would like to go to Kenya or South Africa this year also.  I was thinking of an
  American Express card.  What are better choices ? Thankseb88: It's January 2013,
  Capital One Venture offers 10K bonus miles as sign-up. You mentioned waiting for
  an \"impressive\" bonus. Is this it? Or should I wait? I am leaving Citibank AAdvantage
  after 15 years....Or do you think Chase Sapphire is better \"rewards\" for high
  annual spenders than Capital One? Thanks. LOVE LOVE LOVE this site!gentleway: I'm
  torn...I believe it is good to get a travel card to avoid the foreign trans fee.
  (NOTE: i have the amex blue cash preferred which gets most of daily expenses.) I
  don't want to align to a hotel or airline  so which to get?  Chase Sapphire Preferred,
  Capital One Venture or Citi Thank YOU Premier? \ncap1 is the most simple and nice
  long term but because of my amex card?? \nSapphire Preferred has 2x for travel,
  20% discount on travel, 7% pnt dividend & transfer pts to (a few) airline plans...\nCiti
  TY Premier, 1.2 pts (after 2 years) BUT annual domestic companion ticket (offsets
  annual fee), 33% value for airline purchase thru provide + 15% discount booking
  thru Spirit and the nicest; flight points.\nMy families current travel budget will
  be 3-5k/year but will go up as my kids get a little older.\nSuggestions? I might
  be over-complicating the selection process.Ken K: I have a Southwest card that gives
  me rewards (or points) for the miles I fly plus one point for every dollar spent
  on purchases.  If I switch to a Capital One Venture card do I get points for the
  miles I fly on Southwest plus purchases.Jam: I am not sure, but it feels to me that
  there is one angle of analysis that you guys don't have which I would like very
  much. All these travels cards seem to be of the type where you spend money on \"other
  things\" and gain points to use on flights. What I am really interested in and what
  I can't find a good resource on is a travel card that is the best for the money
  you actually spend on Travel. There are sliders for amount of money spent on gas/grocery/dining
  and then other. I would be interested which cards would be the best if you had a
  travel section in addition to those above categories. I would love to be able to
  max travel and zero out the others and see what cards pop up.Rachel:  I was wondering
  if you could help me with my particular situation. I've just finished school and
  am shopping around for a milage-based credit card. I often from from New York to
  California, Latin America, and India. Personally, I've always preferred flying Virgin
  or JetBlue in the US, international flights I don't have a prefrence for. Would
  it be better to go with an airline card or is there a better option out there for
  me?student traveler: I am a student traveling abroad next semester. I have not had
  a credit card before, but my parents will cosign. I will use the card abroad in
  Western Europe. I am thinking I need one with EMV chip. I only have about a month
  before I leave. Do all EMV cards have no foreign transaction fees? Which one should
  I choose?Jholland99: What happens if u get a card and don't spend that amout within
  the 3 months.. u don't get the bonus then what? Monkeycajones: There must also be
  a distinction between whether the points can be used to book travel (which appears
  to be through the credit cards travel agency), or whether one can actually transfer
  their points to a frequent flier account.  I am interested in transferring points
  into frequent flier programs.  Would you please clarify which cards permit transfer
  of points to the major airlines; and which airlines?Monkeycajones: Thank you for
  your site because I love to find all those great deals.  I am surprised that you
  have not addressed the problem of which airlines one can transfer their points to.
  \ Chase will say that you can transfer to \"20 major airlines\" but when I called
  them, it only included BA, SWA and United for major US airlines.  I have a Diners
  Club card that was wonderful until they decided to stop transfers to American Airlines.
  \ \n\nSo I'm looking for a card that I can transfer the points most major airlines
  - such as Delta, AA, BA and US Airways.  Do you know which cards will do this?  I
  believe all the Chase cards won't do this.  It looks like the Starwood is the only
  one that I can see from your info.  And it would be fabulous if you would include
  this info with your reviews.  Maybe just one article on this subject would be an
  eye-opener for most people.  NerdWallet: You can use the British Airways card's
  Avios (their point system) for American Airlines tickets, and right now they're
  offering a 100,000-mile bonus: http://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/Chase-British-Airways
  \nThe downside is that you have to spend $20,000 in a year to get the full bonus.
  Alternatively, the Chase Sapphire Preferred offers 40,000 bonus points, worth $500
  of travel booked through Chase: http://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/Chase-Sapphire-Preferred
  \nThe AAdvantage cards have decent bonuses. The best is from the Citi AAdvantage
  MasterCard, with 30,000 miles and no first-year fee: http://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/Citibank-Gold-AAdvantage-World-MasterCardDsnolan4:
  I would like a Citibank Amer a/l advantage c/c. Are there any great deals out right
  now? Or is it best to wait for one in the mail. I know I have gotten offers for
  45,000 points in the past.Alvaro: \"Pro tip: Virgin Atlantic credit card. Virgin
  Atlanticâ€™s miles transfer 1:1 to an extensive list of partners, including Starwood,\"
  \ \nWhere can I confirm this? ThanksTaiwanTim: What about the Citi Platinum Select.
  \ It has a $95 fee but I can get 35K bonus points with $1.5K in spend within first
  3 months.  The 35K miles appear to be directly translatable into a OneWorld economy
  ticket to Taiwan (not sure if it is one-way or round-trip).  With upcoming expenses
  that will easily exceed $1.5K it seems I can sign up, garner the points and translate
  directly into a ticket to Taiwan.  Am I missing some fine print? meme: Sadly British
  Airways doesn't have any direct flights from LAX to TPE. Otherwise this would have
  been a great deal.TaiwanTim: I live in the U.S. but travel to Asia at least once
  per year (non-business related).  Which card provides the best mileage rewards to
  translate my domestic spending into an international ticket or at least reduce the
  cost of my international ticketNerdWallet: Hey, thanks for the feedback! The Spark
  Miles/Cash is one of the best options for a small business, since it gives a 2%
  rewards rate on all purchases, so you don't have to deal with rotating categories.
  Alaska, on the other hand, pays out in Alaska Airlines miles, which is quite restrictive.
  It also has a lower rewards rate.itsajelly: So I'm struggling on deciding which
  card to attempt to sign up for.  new small business will have close to $100000 in
  equip to purchase, and then about 3500 a month after that.  Want to travel with
  my wife and staff with card bonus.  Front page suggests spark miles for business,
  but when I fill out little slider questionnaire it is no where to be found as a
  suggestion for small business.  Alaska Air services here in the NW, should I go
  with that?  Confused and want to make a good decision.  Awesome site and thanks
  for the help.Marian Moss: My first time on you website; looks like it is really
  helpful.  ThanksNerdWallet: Maxim,\n\nTo get the full value of your bonus, you'll
  need to book the expense through the Chase Ultimate Rewards website. The 50,000-points
  will get you a $500 credit towards your purchase. When you book through Chase, they
  refund 20% of the points back to your account. In this case, that means another
  $100 to put toward travel. When you use that $100, you'll receive another $20 back,
  then another $4, then $0.80, and so it goes, shrinking infinitely. The immediate
  value of the bonus will grant you $500. The 20% point refunds make up the other
  $125.\n\nYou probably won't have to pay income tax on the signing bonus, though
  it's not outside the realm of possibility. The IRS is now taxing bonuses that exceed
  a perceived worth of $600, but the Sapphire's immediate value is only $500 with
  the other $125 coming manifesting through refunds. We haven't heard any reports
  of cardholders paying income tax on the Sapphire bonus. We're thinking you'll probably
  be okay.Maxim12: I have 2 questions:\n1)Do I have to  change 50,000 points of Chase
  Sapphire to aa, delta, or united miles, then buy the airline ticket from those airlines?
  Or just buy the ticket the pay the ticket by points Or redeem the 50000 pointsx2.5
  cents=$625.00 cash and use that money to buy the ticket?\n2) Do I have to pay income
  tax for $625 promo bonus?\nThanks,\nNerdWallet: Thanks for letting us know! We'll
  fix the image.Jdebach: The Virgin Atlantic Card which earns 1.5 miles/$1 spent is
  actually the Black Card, not the White Card, which is featured in the image above.
  \ The White Card earns 1 miles/$1.  Nerd Wallet... can the image be updated?  The
  link to \"Apply Now' is correct, as it goes to the Black Card application.  NerdWallet:
  The US Bank FlexPerks isn't a terrible card, but you can do a lot better in terms
  of rewards. It earns 2 points per $1 on groceries, airlines and gas and 1 point
  per $1 spent elsewhere, and pays out in FlexPoints.\n\nOne of the major limitations
  of the FlexPerks card is that you get your best rewards value only if you use your
  points to book travel through US Bank. The problem with that is you can't take advantage
  of discount sites like Kayak, so you probably won't get the best deal. It also charges
  a foreign transaction fee of 3%, which is prohibitively high for a traveler. \nThe
  FlexPerks falls short in ease of use and foreign transaction fees, but has a decent
  rewards rate and lower annual fees than some other travel cards. If you tend to
  travel in style - airport lounges, business/first class, etc. - the American Express
  Platinum has a very high annual fee, but makes up for is in travel-related benefits.
  Another option if you tend to splurge on hotels is the Starwood American Express
  ($65 annual fee, waived the first year). We think it gives a value of 2-5% back
  on all purchases if you redeem for Starwood hotel stays, and it gives a flat value
  of 1.25% back on all purchases if you redeem for airline miles with its partners.
  While the Platinum waives its foreign transaction fee, the Starwood does not.\n\nHowever,
  if you're more of a budget traveler, you'll get the most value out of being able
  to book tickets on discount sites, not being tied down to a\nparticular hotel, etc.
  This is the route I tend to prefer, since what you\r\nsacrifice in rewards you make
  up for in flexibility. The best cards for\r\nthis are the Capital One Venture Rewards,
  VentureOne, and Cash. The Venture\r\nRewards gives a flat 2 miles per $1 on all
  purchases and has a $59 annual\r\nfee (waived the first year), while the VentureOne
  gives 1.5 miles and has\r\nno annual fee. The Capital One Cash gives 1.5% cash back
  on all purchases\r\nand has no fee. The benefit of No Hassle Miles is that unlike
  traditional\r\nmiles, you can use them to offset any travel expense - airfare, hotel\r\nstays,
  gas, baggage fees, whatever. Most of the time, if you redeem for an\r\naward ticket,
  you're stuck paying for fees and taxes, but No Hassle Miles\r\ncan be redeemed against
  those expenses as well. All Capital One cards have\r\nno foreign transaction fee,
  and their rewards are much easier to redeem.\r\n\r\nThat said, if you're thinking
  of going for the Capital One Venture, I'd\r\nsuggest you wait a few months. The
  Venture has offered some pretty\r\nimpressive signup bonuses lately, and it's worth
  waiting a while to see if\r\nthey'll up their bonus again. If you have excellent
  credit, you'll be able\r\nto qualify for all of these cards with no problem. And
  since you have\r\nexcellent credit, you can switch to a more lucrative credit card
  and close\r\nyour FlexPerks account entirely to avoid paying an annual fee for a
  card\r\nyou don't use. Account age is an important factor in your credit score,
  but\r\nit's less important if you've already established yourself than if you're\r\njust
  starting to build a history.Ohiojim: I have a US Bank Flex Perks account that I
  have held for 20+ years.  I have been trying to compare it to some cards listed

  can help.NerdWallet: Thanks, AT! You're best off with a Visa or MasterCard - we
  usually recommend the Capital One Venture as it has one of the best rewards rates
  in the business at 2 miles per $1 spent. It has no foreign transaction fee, and
  it's a Visa, so you're in the clear to use it in Australia.NerdWallet: I'd suggest
  the Capital One Venture, because you can use your miles against any travel expense
  - you aren't tied to a single airline program, or even to award flights at all.
  Moreover, it has no foreign transaction fee, so you won't be charged extra when
  you spend money abroad.NerdWallet: Thanks, Travis! Glad to hear we can help, and
  great tip on calling up the card issuer to switch between MC and Visa.\n\n\nCheers,\nThe
  NerdsNerdWallet: Hey Joel-\n\nWe value Hilton HHonors points at 0.5 cents each,
  versus the typical 1 cent each, because the redemption rates are, well, not quite
  the best. Ditto for Marriott points - they went down in value from about 1 cent
  per point to just 0.8 cents apiece because of the lower redemption rates.NerdWallet:
  If you're interested in earning points, you're probably better off with the Capital
  One Venture Rewards, which earns 2 miles per $1 on every purchase. The Amex charge
  cards are known more for their perks (like airport lounge access or airline incidental
  credits) than for great rewards.NerdWallet: Hey there-\n\n\nI'd double check to
  see if the 3x points on gas, groceries and drugstores is a limited time deal (for
  example, you get those rewards only in the first 6 months) or whether those rewards
  last throughout the life of the card. Those kind of great-rewards-short-lifespan
  deals are fairly common, but usually not a good idea.NerdWallet: Corey's got it
  - you'll have to combine points to get there. Your best bet is probably to get the
  United MileagePlus Explorer and use the signup bonus to book one leg of the journey,
  and also get the Chase Sapphire Preferred and redeem your Ultimate Rewards Points
  for a ticket to cover the rest of the journey. That way, your Ultimate Rewards Points
  stretch farther, as they're worth 25% more when used for travel booked through the
  Chase portal.NerdWallet: Hi Mary,\n\nChase is currently revamping the Southwest
  credit card - it comes and goes periodically, so check back soon!Mary Anne: I am
  genuinely surprised to not see the Southwest Rapid Rewards Visa listed, especially
  since you can actually accrue enough points to earn an annual free companion pass.
  \ Why is this card not rated in the mix?Corey: 12k miles on any credit card is not
  enough to get you to India.  What you could do is sign up for the Chase Sapphire
  Preferred card and the United Explorer MileagePlus card  sign-up bonuses to get
  the 80k miles needed for a roundtrip US-India ticket.  40k from the CSP + 30k from
  the United card + 12k from spending = 82k.  There is also a 50k offer for the United
  card floating around that you should be able to get.HealthyTurtle: Thinking about
  making a big purchase (~12K) on a credit card and then using bonus points/purchase
  points for travel from US to India in December. Any recommendations?Guest: I was
  just offered Signature Visa (black) Concierge Services card today by my bank, Wells
  Fargo.  It's a one time offer (so they say).  There is not an annual fee, 0 interest
  for 12 months on purchases and balance transfer.  3 points on gas, groceries and
  drugstores and one point on everything else.  Should I get it?  I presently have
  Capital One Venture which I get 1.25 points on everything.  It sound too good of
  an offer.  please advice.  Thank youDave: I'm trying to decide between Amex Preferred

  Hi Student Traveler,\n\nAn EMV card is a great choice for travelling abroad â€“
  they are indeed more secure than the average credit card, thanks to the EMV chip.
  \n\nEvery time you make a transaction and swipe your card, with or without an EMV
  chip, the point of sales terminal reads your cardâ€™s PIN or code, sent over by
  your cardâ€™s magnetic strip. With just that strip â€“ and without an EMV chip â€“
  the cardâ€™s coding is static â€“ itâ€™s replicable. Meanwhile, with an EMV chip,
  unique code is generated with each transaction, which means itâ€™s much harder to
  access your account. Thereâ€™s that, and the fact that most EMV transactions require
  a PIN â€“ canâ€™t forge that!\n\nNow, onto a specific card recommendation. Itâ€™s
  true that options are a little limited this side of the\npond â€“ EMV is way bigger
  in Europe â€“ but there are a couple cards out there. \n\nMost, unfortunately, will
  charge an annual fee, and theyâ€™re not necessarily catered to students, like\nyourself
  â€“ but you can work around both those problems with the <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/Chase-British-Airways\">British
  Airways Visa Signature card</a>.\n\nFirst, that annual fee: The British Airways
  card may charge you $95 every year, but itâ€™s easy to earn that cash back with
  the signup bonus and rewards. Spend $1,000 in the first 3 months\nâ€“ something
  thatâ€™s not terribly difficult as a student abroad â€“ and youâ€™ll get back 50,000
  Avios. Those are British Airwaysâ€™ points, and theyâ€™re each worth 1 cent, which
  means you get back $50 within the first 3 months of carrying the card. Youâ€™ll
  also earn as you spend, with 1.25 Avios for every $1 on all purchases and 2.5 Avios
  on every $1 of British Airways purchases.\n\nThe only catch: these Avios are redeemable
  for flights with British Airways, and, when youâ€™re back in the States, on American
  Airlines, Cathay Pacific, and LAN. In other words, for this cardâ€™s rewards to
  catch your eye, youâ€™ll want to travel with British Airways abroad or youâ€™ll
  want to book a domestic flight when youâ€™re back Stateside.\n\nSecond, as we already
  mentioned, these cards arenâ€™t catered toward students, which means application
  approval is a little tougher for you. To seal the deal, youâ€™ll need a parent to\nco-sign.
  Assuming theyâ€™ve taken out loans or have an active credit card, your parent will
  have credit history to prove to your lenders that youâ€™re worth the risk with this
  credit card.\n\nIf youâ€™re not looking for travel rewards and want something more
  basic, check out the <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/State-Department-Federal-Credit-Union-Platinum\">State
  Department Federal Credit Union Platinum card</a>. There may not be many perks and
  the rewards may be thin, at 1 Flexpoint per dollar spent, but thereâ€™s no foreign
  transaction fee, annual fee or balance transfer fee.\n\nHope this helps! Let us
  know if you have any further questions.Joel Solon: Has Nerdwallet updated its valuation
  of the recently devalued hotel reward programs such as Hilton and Marriott? I expect
  that it would change the ranking of those cards.Travis Meyer: Hi, Great Site! I
  used your specs to narrow down my next card to the Chase Sapphire and wanted to
  add some info I came across. I was confused as to whether the Sapphire was a Visa
  or Mastercard. A yahoo answer post said that you can choose during the application
  processes, but in my experience this didn't happen. After getting approved, I still
  wasn't told what kind of card it was. This was important because I have a SAMs club
  mebership that doesn't use Visa, only Mastercard/Discover, so I called Chase, and
  they said the card was a VISA, but that I can switch to Mastercard. So I did over
  the phone. Hope this helps future applicants!Jennifer Viera: Hi! Great Blog here!
  I'm looking for a card in which I can transfer my miles/points to any airline on
  a ratio of 1:1. I like the Discover Miles card, but its not accepted in many places.
  I travel to Europe.. so I'm looking for that card. CAustralian Traveler: I'm looking
  for a credit card for my travels to Australia next year.  I currently have a MasterCard
  and I'm fairly certain I can use that over in Australia just fine, but will be subject
  to the 3% foreign transaction fee.  I checked out your list of top credit cards
  with no foreign transaction fees (which is awesome by the way!) but I've heard from
  others that the only credit cards that are accepted in Australia are Visa or MasterCard.
  \ Would you have any knowledge on this subject/know what the best credit card for
  the fewest fees for Australia would be?cottageme.com: This is so cool..thanks so
  much for the info. Love it!Alan : I will go to Japan next month, possibly on United.
  I would like to go to Kenya or South Africa this year also.  I was thinking of an
  American Express card.  What are better choices ? Thankseb88: It's January 2013,
  Capital One Venture offers 10K bonus miles as sign-up. You mentioned waiting for
  an \"impressive\" bonus. Is this it? Or should I wait? I am leaving Citibank AAdvantage

  annual spenders than Capital One? Thanks. LOVE LOVE LOVE this site!gentleway: I'm
  torn...I believe it is good to get a travel card to avoid the foreign trans fee.
  (NOTE: i have the amex blue cash preferred which gets most of daily expenses.) I

  Capital One Venture or Citi Thank YOU Premier? \ncap1 is the most simple and nice
  long term but because of my amex card?? \nSapphire Preferred has 2x for travel,
  20% discount on travel, 7% pnt dividend & transfer pts to (a few) airline plans...\nCiti

  annual fee), 33% value for airline purchase thru provide + 15% discount booking
  thru Spirit and the nicest; flight points.\nMy families current travel budget will
  be 3-5k/year but will go up as my kids get a little older.\nSuggestions? I might
  be over-complicating the selection process.Ken K: I have a Southwest card that gives
  me rewards (or points) for the miles I fly plus one point for every dollar spent
  on purchases.  If I switch to a Capital One Venture card do I get points for the
  miles I fly on Southwest plus purchases.Jam: I am not sure, but it feels to me that
  there is one angle of analysis that you guys don't have which I would like very
  much. All these travels cards seem to be of the type where you spend money on \"other
  things\" and gain points to use on flights. What I am really interested in and what
  I can't find a good resource on is a travel card that is the best for the money
  you actually spend on Travel. There are sliders for amount of money spent on gas/grocery/dining
  and then other. I would be interested which cards would be the best if you had a
  travel section in addition to those above categories. I would love to be able to
  max travel and zero out the others and see what cards pop up.Rachel:  I was wondering
  if you could help me with my particular situation. I've just finished school and
  am shopping around for a milage-based credit card. I often from from New York to
  California, Latin America, and India. Personally, I've always preferred flying Virgin
  or JetBlue in the US, international flights I don't have a prefrence for. Would
  it be better to go with an airline card or is there a better option out there for
  me?student traveler: I am a student traveling abroad next semester. I have not had
  a credit card before, but my parents will cosign. I will use the card abroad in
  Western Europe. I am thinking I need one with EMV chip. I only have about a month
  before I leave. Do all EMV cards have no foreign transaction fees? Which one should
  I choose?Jholland99: What happens if u get a card and don't spend that amout within
  the 3 months.. u don't get the bonus then what? Monkeycajones: There must also be
  a distinction between whether the points can be used to book travel (which appears
  to be through the credit cards travel agency), or whether one can actually transfer
  their points to a frequent flier account.  I am interested in transferring points
  into frequent flier programs.  Would you please clarify which cards permit transfer
  of points to the major airlines; and which airlines?Monkeycajones: Thank you for
  your site because I love to find all those great deals.  I am surprised that you
  have not addressed the problem of which airlines one can transfer their points to.
  \ Chase will say that you can transfer to \"20 major airlines\" but when I called
  them, it only included BA, SWA and United for major US airlines.  I have a Diners
  Club card that was wonderful until they decided to stop transfers to American Airlines.
  \ \n\nSo I'm looking for a card that I can transfer the points most major airlines
  - such as Delta, AA, BA and US Airways.  Do you know which cards will do this?  I
  believe all the Chase cards won't do this.  It looks like the Starwood is the only
  one that I can see from your info.  And it would be fabulous if you would include
  this info with your reviews.  Maybe just one article on this subject would be an
  eye-opener for most people.  NerdWallet: You can use the British Airways card's
  Avios (their point system) for American Airlines tickets, and right now they're
  offering a 100,000-mile bonus: http://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/Chase-British-Airways
  \nThe downside is that you have to spend $20,000 in a year to get the full bonus.
  Alternatively, the Chase Sapphire Preferred offers 40,000 bonus points, worth $500
  of travel booked through Chase: http://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/Chase-Sapphire-Preferred
  \nThe AAdvantage cards have decent bonuses. The best is from the Citi AAdvantage
  MasterCard, with 30,000 miles and no first-year fee: http://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/Citibank-Gold-AAdvantage-World-MasterCardDsnolan4:
  I would like a Citibank Amer a/l advantage c/c. Are there any great deals out right
  now? Or is it best to wait for one in the mail. I know I have gotten offers for
  45,000 points in the past.Alvaro: \"Pro tip: Virgin Atlantic credit card. Virgin
  Atlanticâ€™s miles transfer 1:1 to an extensive list of partners, including Starwood,\"
  \ \nWhere can I confirm this? ThanksTaiwanTim: What about the Citi Platinum Select.
  \ It has a $95 fee but I can get 35K bonus points with $1.5K in spend within first
  3 months.  The 35K miles appear to be directly translatable into a OneWorld economy
  ticket to Taiwan (not sure if it is one-way or round-trip).  With upcoming expenses
  that will easily exceed $1.5K it seems I can sign up, garner the points and translate
  directly into a ticket to Taiwan.  Am I missing some fine print? meme: Sadly British
  Airways doesn't have any direct flights from LAX to TPE. Otherwise this would have
  been a great deal.TaiwanTim: I live in the U.S. but travel to Asia at least once
  per year (non-business related).  Which card provides the best mileage rewards to
  translate my domestic spending into an international ticket or at least reduce the
  cost of my international ticketNerdWallet: Hey, thanks for the feedback! The Spark
  Miles/Cash is one of the best options for a small business, since it gives a 2%
  rewards rate on all purchases, so you don't have to deal with rotating categories.
  Alaska, on the other hand, pays out in Alaska Airlines miles, which is quite restrictive.
  It also has a lower rewards rate.itsajelly: So I'm struggling on deciding which
  card to attempt to sign up for.  new small business will have close to $100000 in
  equip to purchase, and then about 3500 a month after that.  Want to travel with
  my wife and staff with card bonus.  Front page suggests spark miles for business,
  but when I fill out little slider questionnaire it is no where to be found as a
  suggestion for small business.  Alaska Air services here in the NW, should I go
  with that?  Confused and want to make a good decision.  Awesome site and thanks
  for the help.Marian Moss: My first time on you website; looks like it is really
  helpful.  ThanksNerdWallet: Maxim,\n\nTo get the full value of your bonus, you'll
  need to book the expense through the Chase Ultimate Rewards website. The 50,000-points
  will get you a $500 credit towards your purchase. When you book through Chase, they
  refund 20% of the points back to your account. In this case, that means another
  $100 to put toward travel. When you use that $100, you'll receive another $20 back,
  then another $4, then $0.80, and so it goes, shrinking infinitely. The immediate
  value of the bonus will grant you $500. The 20% point refunds make up the other
  $125.\n\nYou probably won't have to pay income tax on the signing bonus, though
  it's not outside the realm of possibility. The IRS is now taxing bonuses that exceed
  a perceived worth of $600, but the Sapphire's immediate value is only $500 with
  the other $125 coming manifesting through refunds. We haven't heard any reports
  of cardholders paying income tax on the Sapphire bonus. We're thinking you'll probably
  be okay.Maxim12: I have 2 questions:\n1)Do I have to  change 50,000 points of Chase
  Sapphire to aa, delta, or united miles, then buy the airline ticket from those airlines?
  Or just buy the ticket the pay the ticket by points Or redeem the 50000 pointsx2.5
  cents=$625.00 cash and use that money to buy the ticket?\n2) Do I have to pay income
  tax for $625 promo bonus?\nThanks,\nNerdWallet: Thanks for letting us know! We'll
  fix the image.Jdebach: The Virgin Atlantic Card which earns 1.5 miles/$1 spent is
  actually the Black Card, not the White Card, which is featured in the image above.
  \ The White Card earns 1 miles/$1.  Nerd Wallet... can the image be updated?  The
  link to \"Apply Now' is correct, as it goes to the Black Card application.  NerdWallet:
  The US Bank FlexPerks isn't a terrible card, but you can do a lot better in terms
  of rewards. It earns 2 points per $1 on groceries, airlines and gas and 1 point
  per $1 spent elsewhere, and pays out in FlexPoints.\n\nOne of the major limitations
  of the FlexPerks card is that you get your best rewards value only if you use your
  points to book travel through US Bank. The problem with that is you can't take advantage
  of discount sites like Kayak, so you probably won't get the best deal. It also charges
  a foreign transaction fee of 3%, which is prohibitively high for a traveler. \nThe
  FlexPerks falls short in ease of use and foreign transaction fees, but has a decent
  rewards rate and lower annual fees than some other travel cards. If you tend to
  travel in style - airport lounges, business/first class, etc. - the American Express
  Platinum has a very high annual fee, but makes up for is in travel-related benefits.
  Another option if you tend to splurge on hotels is the Starwood American Express
  ($65 annual fee, waived the first year). We think it gives a value of 2-5% back
  on all purchases if you redeem for Starwood hotel stays, and it gives a flat value
  of 1.25% back on all purchases if you redeem for airline miles with its partners.
  While the Platinum waives its foreign transaction fee, the Starwood does not.\n\nHowever,
  if you're more of a budget traveler, you'll get the most value out of being able
  to book tickets on discount sites, not being tied down to a\nparticular hotel, etc.
  This is the route I tend to prefer, since what you\r\nsacrifice in rewards you make
  up for in flexibility. The best cards for\r\nthis are the Capital One Venture Rewards,
  VentureOne, and Cash. The Venture\r\nRewards gives a flat 2 miles per $1 on all
  purchases and has a $59 annual\r\nfee (waived the first year), while the VentureOne
  gives 1.5 miles and has\r\nno annual fee. The Capital One Cash gives 1.5% cash back
  on all purchases\r\nand has no fee. The benefit of No Hassle Miles is that unlike
  traditional\r\nmiles, you can use them to offset any travel expense - airfare, hotel\r\nstays,
  gas, baggage fees, whatever. Most of the time, if you redeem for an\r\naward ticket,
  you're stuck paying for fees and taxes, but No Hassle Miles\r\ncan be redeemed against
  those expenses as well. All Capital One cards have\r\nno foreign transaction fee,
  and their rewards are much easier to redeem.\r\n\r\nThat said, if you're thinking
  of going for the Capital One Venture, I'd\r\nsuggest you wait a few months. The
  Venture has offered some pretty\r\nimpressive signup bonuses lately, and it's worth
  waiting a while to see if\r\nthey'll up their bonus again. If you have excellent
  credit, you'll be able\r\nto qualify for all of these cards with no problem. And
  since you have\r\nexcellent credit, you can switch to a more lucrative credit card
  and close\r\nyour FlexPerks account entirely to avoid paying an annual fee for a
  card\r\nyou don't use. Account age is an important factor in your credit score,
  but\r\nit's less important if you've already established yourself than if you're\r\njust
  starting to build a history.Ohiojim: I have a US Bank Flex Perks account that I
  have held for 20+ years.  I have been trying to compare it to some cards listed
