                  ANALOGY IN PATRISTICAND MEDIEVAL THOUGHT
- "                \n"
- |2
                  The middle Ages made abundant use of analogy and
- |2
                      symbolism in all aspects of its culture. Indeed, its mentality has rightly
- |2
                      been described as symbolic. At the end of the Middle Ages Dante's Divine Comedy perfectly expresses this mentality;
- |2
                      but as early as the first centuries after Christ the bases of medieval
- |2
                          sym- bolism were laid down by the Church
- |2
                      Fathers.
- "                \n"
- |2
                          1. The Patristic Period.
- |2
                       The Fathers of the Church cultivated symbolism both as a means of
- |2
                      interpreting Scripture and of understanding the world and God, its
- |2
                      transcendent cause. Influenced by Philo, Clement of Alexandria makes
- |2
                      frequent use of symbolism. For him, symbolism expresses the basic unity in
- |2
                      all things, de- spite their multiplicity and
- |2
                      diversity. Invisible harmo- nies, likenesses,
- |2
                      and proportions bind the universe to- gether,
- |2
                      and these can be interpreted by symbols and allegories. Thus symbolism
- |2
                      reveals the hidden connec- tion between
- |2
                      things and points to their underlying unity. Allegorical interpretation of
- |2
                      Scripture is needed because its truth is veiled in symbols. Clement
- |2
                      justifies the concealing of truth in symbols as a means of giving
- |2
                      truth greater power over minds. Moreover, by their ambiguity symbols
- |2
                      contain a richness and complexity of meaning, in contrast to clear
- |2
                      statements, that convey but one message to the reader.
- |2
                  Clement's pupil, Origen, distinguishes between the literal or historical
- |2
                      meaning of Scripture and its spirit- ual or
- |2
                      allegorical meaning. The spiritual sense, lying beneath the obvious,
- |2
                      literal meaning, is the one princi- pally
- |2
                      intended by the Holy Spirit, the main author of Scripture, and it can be
- |2
                      grasped only by the enlight- ened and
- |2
                      initiated.
- |2
                  For Origen, the allegorical interpretation of Scrip-
- |2
                          ture is justified by the fact that the cosmos itself is a vast
- |2
                      set of symbols created by God to lead the mind to him. Visible nature is a
- |2
                      symbol of the invisible world in which each individual has its ideal model
- |2
                      or type. Hence all things, Scripture included, have two facets: one
- |2
                      corporeal and sensible, the other spiritual and mystical. Because God is
- |2
                      the author of both Scripture and Nature, we should except similar problems
- |2
                      in understanding them (De principiis IV, 1,
- |2
                      7). Like Scripture, nature is a sacred mystery that can be best
- |2
                      expressed by symbols. Only by deciphering the imprint left by God on the
- |2
                      world can we raise ourselves to the transcendent, invisible world; for God
- |2
                      has so ordered his creation, has so linked the lower to the higher by
- |2
                      subtle signatures and affinities, that the world we see is, as it were, a
- |2
                      great staircase by which the mind of man must climb upwards to spiritual
- |2
                          intelli- gence (In
- |2
                          canticum canticorum 3).
- "                \n"
- |2
                   Cosmic symbolism was most clearly expressed for the Middle Ages by Denis,
- |2
                      the Pseudo-Areopagite (fifth century A.D.). The word
- |2
                      ἀναλογία
- |2
                      often appears in his writings, generally with the meaning of relation
- |2
                      or proportion. The proportion denoted by the term is not abstract or
- |2
                      mathematical but the concrete relation of love between creatures and God.
- |2
                      On the one hand, it means the creature's desire for deification, and,
- |2
                      on the other, God's appearance (theophany) to creatures. Denis also
- |2
                      uses the term to denote the divine ideas, which define the creature's
- |2
                      position in the hierarchy of creation and his capacity to receive divine
- |2
                      gifts. It also means the creature's capacity for these gifts and his
- |2
                      loving response to God.
- |2
                  For Denis a symbol
- |2
                      (σύμβολον)
- |2
                      is the relating or adapting of visible forms in order to reveal
- |2
                      something invisible. Symbols are “unlike likenesses,”
- |2
                      and hence when applied to God they both conceal and reveal him. No
- |2
                      symbol, however, can give us a positive knowledge of the divinity.
- |2
                      Following Plotinus and Proclus he conceives God as infinite and one, trans- cending being or reality and every
- |2
                      conceivable positive perfection. As infinite, he is strictly inimitable by
- |2
                          any- thing finite; and yet the finite
- |2
                      universe participates in his riches. This justifies our giving positive
- |2
                      names to him, such as “goodness” and
- |2
                      “being.” More suitable are negative names like
- |2
                      “one” and “infinite.” More
- |2
                      appropriate still are superlative names like “super- good” and
- |2
                      “super-being.” In the end we know God best by
- |2
                      realizing our ignorance of him (Divine Names 7, 3;
- |2
                      PG 3, 872B).
- |2
                  Following Cicero and the Latin grammarians, the Latin Fathers used proportio as the equivalent of
- |2
                      ἀναλογία.
- |2
                      In the broad sense it meant any likeness or comparison; more strictly it
- |2
                      denoted a likeness or identity of proportions: as a
- |2
                      is to b, so c is to d. For Saint Augustine analogy is a method of
- |2
                      scriptural in- terpretation by which the
- |2
                      harmony of the Old and New Testaments is established. This differs from
- |2
                      allegory, which reveals the figurative, as opposed to the literal,
- |2
                      sense of Scripture. In the strict sense, Augustine denies that there is an
- |2
                      analogy between the trinity of faculties of the soul (memory, intelligence,
- |2
                      and will) and the trinity of divine Persons, because this is not a
- |2
                      true comparison between them leading to a knowledge of the Trinity
- |2
                          (Sermo 52, 10; PL 38, 364).
- |2
                  Augustine prefers the term “sign” to
- |2
                      “analogy.” A sign is any word or thing that leads to
- |2
                      a knowledge of something else. If it points to the divine, it is asacramentum. The universe itself is holy (a
- |2
                      sacrament), for it contains signs leading the mind above itself to
- |2
                      God. Words have a proper meaning (signa propria) but
- |2
                      they also have a figurative sense (signa translata),
- |2
                      expressing the mysteries hidden within things. In the065
- |2
                       interpretation of Scripture and in the study of nature he has
- |2
                      recourse to allegory and symbols drawn from both biblical and classical
- |2
                      sources. Numbers, for exam- ple, have mysterious
- |2
                      and symbolic meanings.
- |2
                  The Dionysian and Augustinian symbolism derive from Neo-Platonism, though
- |2
                      the former places more emphasis on cosmic symbolism and the latter on
- |2
                      the symbolic value of human signs and history as instru- ments of spiritual experience. Both tend to devalue
- |2
                      the physical contents of reality and the importance of scientific
- |2
                      explanation through intrinsic causes, and to place the true significance of
- |2
                      reality in its essential reference to the transcendent God.
- "                \n"
- |2
                          2. The Early Middle Ages.
- |2
                       Like Augustine, Boethius transmitted classical philosophical ideas to
- |2
                      the Middle Ages. In his logical works he translates
- |2
                      ἀναλογία ascomparatio or proportio,
- |2
                      ἀναλογον
- |2
                      as proportionale. Proportio he defines as the
- |2
                      comparison of similar things. For example, there is a proportion between
- |2
                      the relation of 4 to 2 and 40 to 20. Similarly genus is related to
- |2
                      specific difference as matter is related to form, e.g., animality to
- |2
                      rationality in the definition of man.
- |2
                  When treating of our knowledge of God, Boethius does not appeal to this
- |2
                      Aristotelian type of analogy but to the Platonic notions of participation
- |2
                      and image. This is because he denies any comparison between the
- |2
                      infinite and finite (De consolatione philosophiae
- |2
                      II, prose 7). Thus God is said to be good by substance, whereas
- |2
                      creatures are called good because they come from his goodness and
- |2
                      participate in it. This is shown by their tendency to goodness. They are
- |2
                      “similar to the primal goodness” and hence are called
- |2
                      good in reference to it.
- |2
                  This rests on the Neo-Platonic notion that by partic- ipation the intelligible, divine world descends
- |2
                      into matter. The former is the archetype, the latter is its image, and
- |2
                      as such it is the visible representation of spiritual realities.
- |2
                  In the Byzantine world this same principle was used by Saint John Damascene
- |2
                      to defend the cult of sacred images. The prototype really exists in its
- |2
                      image, he contended. Hence Christ and the saints are really pres- ent in icons; they are there by way of image
- |2
                      (εἰκονικός).
- |2
                      Thus an icon is a visible means by which God can be sensibly worshiped. An
- |2
                      icon contains its subject “sacramentally.” It is a part of
- |2
                      the heavenly world projected into the earthly. As such, it is the seat of
- |2
                      spiritual powers which are communicated to a worshiper suita- bly disposed to receive them.
- |2
                  The iconoclasts of the East dismissed these ideas as essentially pagan and
- |2
                      forbade the making of icons. The Western Church at the time of Charlemagne
- |2
                          consid- ered sacred images useful as
- |2
                      adornments and as instructive in historical matters. But the Libri Carolini
- |2
                      forbade the worship of images as repositories of spirit- ual powers. At this period the West had
- |2
                      no interest in, or understanding of, the Christian Neo-Platonic
- |2
                      interpretation of images as projections of spiritual forces into matter. It
- |2
                      was scarcely ready to receive the works of John Scotus Erigena, who a
- |2
                      century after Charlemagne translated into Latin the Corpus Dionysiacum and incorporated Denis' Christian Neo- Platonism into his own writings.
- |2
                  The patristic theme of the symbolic value of visible creation for the
- |2
                      revelation of God was familiar to writers of the eleventh and twelfth
- |2
                      centuries. Thus Hugh of Saint Victor compares the sensible universe to
- |2
                      a book written by the finger of God. Everything in it is a figure, not
- |2
                      invented by human ingenuity, but instituted by the divine will, in order to
- |2
                      manifest and signify in some way the hidden attributes of God. Alain
- |2
                      of Lille puts this notion in poetry: Omnis mundi cre- atura/ Quasi liber et pictura/ Nobis est
- |2
                          et speculum (Rythmus; PL 210, 579).
- |2
                      Aelred of Rievaulx speaks of the visible world as the first garment of God,
- |2
                      the second being Scripture.
- |2
                  Cosmological analogies, often borrowed from bibli-
- |2
                      cal and classical sources, abound in early medieval writings. Thus
- |2
                      Macrobius speaks of the glory of God illuminating the whole world
- |2
                      “as one face fills many mirrors placed in due order.”
- |2
                      Alain of Lille compares the universe to a feudal city, with its
- |2
                      periphery inverted. The empyrean is the central castle where the
- |2
                      emperor (God) sits enthroned. The lower heaven is occupied by the angelic
- |2
                      knighthood; while we on earth are outside the city wall. These are but two
- |2
                      aspects of the “discarded image” of the Middle Ages
- |2
                      (to use C. S. Lewis' phrase). Both, incidentally, appear in Dante's
- |2
                          Divine Comedy.
- |2
                  Political and ecclesiastical analogies played signifi- cant roles in medieval society. In the twelfth
- |2
                      century the term “mystical body of Christ,”
- |2
                      previously applied to the consecrated host, was gradually transferred
- |2
                      to the Christian people, whose head is Christ. By analogy this
- |2
                      theological notion was then applied to the body politic, which was called
- |2
                      “the mystical body of the commonweal.” Secular rulers
- |2
                      borrowed the insignia of spiritual dignitaries; kings were thought of as
- |2
                      married to their realms as Christ is married to the Church. In the
- |2
                      English Tudor period this developed into the notion of “the
- |2
                      King's two bodies”—his natural body and his body
- |2
                      politic. On the other hand, medieval spiritual leaders borrowed the symbols
- |2
                      of the secular powers. The pope, for example, was called
- |2
                      “prince” and “true emperor” in
- |2
                      the later Middle Ages.
- |2
                  The logical basis of such analogies occupied early medieval logicians such
- |2
                      as Abelard. Discussing the transference (transumptio) of terms, he points out that066
- |2
                       a term that principally signifies one thing may be applied to
- |2
                      another because of some likeness. Thus we can say “The meadow
- |2
                      smiles,” transferring “smiles” from its
- |2
                      proper usage to a metaphorical one. Rules were laid down for arguments
- |2
                      based on such transfer- ence of terms.
- |2
                      Abelard bases the argument by analogy on the maxim: “What occurs
- |2
                      in the case of some pro- portional things
- |2
                      happens in others.” Thus one can argue that the ruler of a city
- |2
                      should not be chosen by lot but for his knowledge, for this is how the
- |2
                      pilot of a ship should be chosen (Dialectica, ed. De
- |2
                      Rijk, p. 442).

                          3. The Late Middle Ages.
- |2
                       With the discovery of the complete works of Aristotle in the twelfth
- |2
                      and thir- teenth centuries, medieval theories
- |2
                      of analogy came more decisively under his influence. No less than the
- |2
                      Church Fathers, the scholastics of the later Middle Ages viewed the
- |2
                      universe through religious eyes. For them, too, the universe bears witness
- |2
                      to the existence and attributes of its creator. But under the impact
- |2
                      of Aristotelianism, a Christian naturalism arose that accorded to the
- |2
                      universe a secular dimension unknown to the early Middle Ages. Creatures
- |2
                      were not pure symbols: transparent films, so to
- |2
                      speak, through which God's glory shines. They were created natures
- |2
                      with values and ends of their own, though subordinate to their
- |2
                      creator. The scholastic doctrines of analogy (es-
- |2
                          pecially that of Saint Thomas Aquinas) were designed to express
- |2
                      this fact.
- |2
                  No scholastic caught the spirit of the Fathers better than Saint
- |2
                      Bonaventure. His Journey of the Mind to God traces
- |2
                      the stages by which the human mind ascends to its creator. The first stage
- |2
                      is the discovery of God's “footprints” (vestigia) in the sensible world. Like a mirror this
- |2
                      world reflects its creator in a distant way, e.g., through its being or
- |2
                      existence. He is seen more closely and intimately through his image im- planted in the spiritual soul. The sensible
- |2
                      world is an exterior “book,” the mind an interior
- |2
                      one, in which its creator can be read.
- |2
                  Bonaventure distinguishes between two kinds of analogy. The first is based
- |2
                      on the unequal participation of several things in one nature, as both man
- |2
                      and dog are called animals, though man possesses animal nature more
- |2
                      perfectly. The second is based on the unity not of nature, but of
- |2
                      proportional likeness. This is the kind of analogy between God and
- |2
                      creatures. They do not participate in one nature but there is a
- |2
                      proportional similitude between them. Hence terms such as “good- ness” can be predicated by
- |2
                      analogy of both of them. Proportional unity is sometimes found among crea- tures; e.g., “light”
- |2
                      is predicated of heavenly and earthly bodies, not because they share in one
- |2
                      nature but be- cause of their proportional
- |2
                      likeness. Analogy always
- |2
                       implies similarity and dissimilarity; in the case of God and
- |2
                      creatures the dissimilarity is greater than the similarity.
- |2
                  For Saint Thomas Aquinas, as for Saint Bonaventure, names apply to God and
- |2
                      creatures only by analogy. Names cannot be predicated of them univocally,
- |2
                      i.e., in entirely the same sense, for this would imply that they have
- |2
                      a nature in common. Aquinas defines a univocal term as one whose meaning is
- |2
                      entirely the same when predicated of several things; e.g.,
- |2
                      “animal” predicated of horse and cow. An equivocal
- |2
                      term is attributed to several things with entirely different meanings;
- |2
                      e.g., “dog” predicated of the animal and the
- |2
                      constellation. Analogous terms are predicated of sev-
- |2
                          eral subjects with a meaning that is partly the same and partly
- |2
                      different. More precisely, their meaning is absolutely (simpliciter) different and relatively or pro- portionately (secundum quid)
- |2
                      the same. For example, both animals and food are called healthy:
- |2
                      animals because they possess health in the proper sense of the term,
- |2
                      food because it is a cause of health.
- |2
                  Thus predication by analogy means predication ac-
- |2
                          cording to a relation or proportion. This may be a relation of
- |2
                      one thing to another, as in the above exam- ple
- |2
                      of health. Or it may be a likeness of proportions, or proportionality;
- |2
                      e.g., “sight” is attributed to both the eye and the
- |2
                      intellect, because as sight is in the eye, so understanding is in the mind
- |2
                      (Saint Thomas Aquinas, On Truth, 2, 11). In some
- |2
                      proportionalities names are transferred to things to which they do not
- |2
                      properly belong, the transference being justified by a similarity of
- |2
                      effects. For example, God is called a “sun” because
- |2
                      he is the source of spiritual life as the sun is the source of physical
- |2
                      life. Such a transference of a name Thomas calls a metaphor. He points out
- |2
                      that Scripture contains many metaphors of corporeal prop- erties being transferred to spiritual realities
- |2
                      because of a dynamic likeness. Thus grace is said to efface spiritual
- |2
                      stains as water washes away bodily stains.
- |2
                  In other proportionalities there is no figurative transference of terms. The
- |2
                      term is ascribed to several things in its proper sense, though they possess
- |2
                      the property denoted by the term in different modes. Thus
- |2
                      “being” is ascribed to man and stone in its proper
- |2
                      sense, but their being is only proportionately the same, for each
- |2
                      exists or is a being in proportion to its nature. Similarly
- |2
                      “goodness” is attributed to God and creatures in its
- |2
                      proper sense, though God possesses goodness in a higher mode than
- |2
                      creatures.
- |2
                  The Thomistic doctrine of analogy makes it possible to speak meaningfully of
- |2
                      God and to establish a theol- ogy, i.e., a
- |2
                      science of God. But it does not allow us to know what God is in himself.
- |2
                      Our knowledge of God is either negative (as when we know that he is067
- |2
                       not material or not finite), or it is analogical (i.e., he is
- |2
                      known insofar as he is represented by creatures by proportional
- |2
                      similitude).
- |2
                  Duns Scotus, on the contrary, contended that nega-
- |2
                      tive and analogical knowledge of God presupposes more basic univocal
- |2
                      concepts of God and creatures. He argued that we cannot know what God is
- |2
                      not, unless we first know what he is. Hence we must conceive God
- |2
                      through positive concepts, derived from creatures, which apply to them in
- |2
                      exactly the same sense. Exam- ples of such
- |2
                      univocal concepts are “being” and the transcendental
- |2
                      properties of being such as “goodness.” Scotus also
- |2
                      argued that we cannot know God by anal- ogy with
- |2
                      creatures unless we know the two terms of the analogy, and for this we need
- |2
                      absolute (i.e., nonre- lational) concepts
- |2
                      of what God is in himself. Such knowledge is given through univocal
- |2
                      concepts, espe- cially that of being. For
- |2
                      Scotus, however, being is a univocal concept only when abstracted from all
- |2
                      its modalities. When beings are considered as they actu- ally exist, they are either infinite and uncreated
- |2
                      being (God), or they are finite and created being (creatures). Thus
- |2
                      conceived, they are beings only by analogy.
- |2
                  Toward the close of the Middle Ages theories of analogy came more strongly
- |2
                      under the influence of Neo-Platonism. In particular, there was a revival
- |2
                      of Boethian and Dionysian perspectives on analogy in the works of
- |2
                      Eckhart and Nicholas of Cusa.
- |2
                  For Master Eckhart God is the analogous cause of creatures. Since there is
- |2
                      both similarity and dissimilar- ity
- |2
                      between the creator and his creatures, names given to them in common, such
- |2
                      as “unity,” “being,” and
- |2
                      “goodness,” are neither univocal nor equivocal but
- |2
                      analogous. Things participate in the divine perfections but they do not
- |2
                      possess them as their own. In them- selves
- |2
                      they are pure nothingness. They are said to be, to be one or good, only in
- |2
                      reference to God, who alone is Being, Unity, and Goodness. These
- |2
                      perfections are ascribed to creatures entirely from without and they
- |2
                      never positively take root in them.
- |2
                  Nicholas of Cusa resorted to symbolism to arrive at a knowledge of spiritual
- |2
                      realities. Convinced that the visible universe is a faithful reflection of
- |2
                      the invisible divine world, he thought it legitimate to use images to
- |2
                      reach the latter analogically. He praised the Platon- ists, especially Augustine and Boethius, for
- |2
                      realizing that the most perfect images of spiritual realities are
- |2
                      drawn from mathematics—the science that gives the greatest
- |2
                      certitude. Cusa himself often used mathe-
- |2
                      matical symbols in his mystical ascent to God. Thus for him the
- |2
                      coincidence of an infinite straight line with an infinite circle and
- |2
                      triangle shows by analogy the coincidence of opposites in the infinite God
- |2
                          (De docta ignorantia I, 11-16).

               Dictionary of the History of IdeasThe middle Ages made abundant use of analogy and
- |2
                      symbolism in all aspects of its culture. Indeed, its mentality has rightly
- |2
                      been described as symbolic. At the end of the Middle Ages Dante's Divine Comedy perfectly expresses this mentality;
- |2
                      but as early as the first centuries after Christ the bases of medieval
- |2
                          sym- bolism were laid down by the Church
- |2
                      Fathers.
- |2
                          1. The Patristic Period.
- |2
                       The Fathers of the Church cultivated symbolism both as a means of
- |2
                      interpreting Scripture and of understanding the world and God, its
- |2
                      transcendent cause. Influenced by Philo, Clement of Alexandria makes
- |2
                      frequent use of symbolism. For him, symbolism expresses the basic unity in
- |2
                      all things, de- spite their multiplicity and
- |2
                      diversity. Invisible harmo- nies, likenesses,
- |2
                      and proportions bind the universe to- gether,
- |2
                      and these can be interpreted by symbols and allegories. Thus symbolism
- |2
                      reveals the hidden connec- tion between
- |2
                      things and points to their underlying unity. Allegorical interpretation of
- |2
                      Scripture is needed because its truth is veiled in symbols. Clement
- |2
                      justifies the concealing of truth in symbols as a means of giving
- |2
                      truth greater power over minds. Moreover, by their ambiguity symbols
- |2
                      contain a richness and complexity of meaning, in contrast to clear
- |2
                      statements, that convey but one message to the reader.Clement's pupil, Origen, distinguishes between the literal or historical
- |2
                      meaning of Scripture and its spirit- ual or
- |2
                      allegorical meaning. The spiritual sense, lying beneath the obvious,
- |2
                      literal meaning, is the one princi- pally
- |2
                      intended by the Holy Spirit, the main author of Scripture, and it can be
- |2
                      grasped only by the enlight- ened and
- |2
                      initiated.For Origen, the allegorical interpretation of Scrip-
- |2
                          ture is justified by the fact that the cosmos itself is a vast
- |2
                      set of symbols created by God to lead the mind to him. Visible nature is a
- |2
                      symbol of the invisible world in which each individual has its ideal model
- |2
                      or type. Hence all things, Scripture included, have two facets: one
- |2
                      corporeal and sensible, the other spiritual and mystical. Because God is
- |2
                      the author of both Scripture and Nature, we should except similar problems
- |2
                      in understanding them (De principiis IV, 1,
- |2
                      7). Like Scripture, nature is a sacred mystery that can be best
- |2
                      expressed by symbols. Only by deciphering the imprint left by God on the
- |2
                      world can we raise ourselves to the transcendent, invisible world; for God
- |2
                      has so ordered his creation, has so linked the lower to the higher by
- |2
                      subtle signatures and affinities, that the world we see is, as it were, a
- |2
                      great staircase by which the mind of man must climb upwards to spiritual
- |2
                          intelli- gence (In
- |2
                          canticum canticorum 3). Cosmic symbolism was most clearly expressed for the Middle Ages by Denis,
- |2
                      the Pseudo-Areopagite (fifth century A.D.). The word
- |2
                      ἀναλογία
- |2
                      often appears in his writings, generally with the meaning of relation
- |2
                      or proportion. The proportion denoted by the term is not abstract or
- |2
                      mathematical but the concrete relation of love between creatures and God.
- |2
                      On the one hand, it means the creature's desire for deification, and,
- |2
                      on the other, God's appearance (theophany) to creatures. Denis also
- |2
                      uses the term to denote the divine ideas, which define the creature's
- |2
                      position in the hierarchy of creation and his capacity to receive divine
- |2
                      gifts. It also means the creature's capacity for these gifts and his
- |2
                      loving response to God.For Denis a symbol
- |2
                      (σύμβολον)
- |2
                      is the relating or adapting of visible forms in order to reveal
- |2
                      something invisible. Symbols are “unlike likenesses,”
- |2
                      and hence when applied to God they both conceal and reveal him. No
- |2
                      symbol, however, can give us a positive knowledge of the divinity.
- |2
                      Following Plotinus and Proclus he conceives God as infinite and one, trans- cending being or reality and every
- |2
                      conceivable positive perfection. As infinite, he is strictly inimitable by
- |2
                          any- thing finite; and yet the finite
- |2
                      universe participates in his riches. This justifies our giving positive
- |2
                      names to him, such as “goodness” and
- |2
                      “being.” More suitable are negative names like
- |2
                      “one” and “infinite.” More
- |2
                      appropriate still are superlative names like “super- good” and
- |2
                      “super-being.” In the end we know God best by
- |2
                      realizing our ignorance of him (Divine Names 7, 3;
- |2
                      PG 3, 872B).Following Cicero and the Latin grammarians, the Latin Fathers used proportio as the equivalent of
- |2
                      ἀναλογία.
- |2
                      In the broad sense it meant any likeness or comparison; more strictly it
- |2
                      denoted a likeness or identity of proportions: as a
- |2
                      is to b, so c is to d. For Saint Augustine analogy is a method of
- |2
                      scriptural in- terpretation by which the
- |2
                      harmony of the Old and New Testaments is established. This differs from
- |2
                      allegory, which reveals the figurative, as opposed to the literal,
- |2
                      sense of Scripture. In the strict sense, Augustine denies that there is an
- |2
                      analogy between the trinity of faculties of the soul (memory, intelligence,
- |2
                      and will) and the trinity of divine Persons, because this is not a
- |2
                      true comparison between them leading to a knowledge of the Trinity
- |2
                          (Sermo 52, 10; PL 38, 364).Augustine prefers the term “sign” to
- |2
                      “analogy.” A sign is any word or thing that leads to
- |2
                      a knowledge of something else. If it points to the divine, it is asacramentum. The universe itself is holy (a
- |2
                      sacrament), for it contains signs leading the mind above itself to
- |2
                      God. Words have a proper meaning (signa propria) but
- |2
                      they also have a figurative sense (signa translata),
- |2
                      expressing the mysteries hidden within things. In theThe Dionysian and Augustinian symbolism derive from Neo-Platonism, though
- |2
                      the former places more emphasis on cosmic symbolism and the latter on
- |2
                      the symbolic value of human signs and history as instru- ments of spiritual experience. Both tend to devalue
- |2
                      the physical contents of reality and the importance of scientific
- |2
                      explanation through intrinsic causes, and to place the true significance of
- |2
                      reality in its essential reference to the transcendent God.
- |2
                          2. The Early Middle Ages.
- |2
                       Like Augustine, Boethius transmitted classical philosophical ideas to
- |2
                      the Middle Ages. In his logical works he translates
- |2
                      ἀναλογία ascomparatio or proportio,
- |2
                      ἀναλογον
- |2
                      as proportionale. Proportio he defines as the
- |2
                      comparison of similar things. For example, there is a proportion between
- |2
                      the relation of 4 to 2 and 40 to 20. Similarly genus is related to
- |2
                      specific difference as matter is related to form, e.g., animality to
- |2
                      rationality in the definition of man.When treating of our knowledge of God, Boethius does not appeal to this
- |2
                      Aristotelian type of analogy but to the Platonic notions of participation
- |2
                      and image. This is because he denies any comparison between the
- |2
                      infinite and finite (De consolatione philosophiae
- |2
                      II, prose 7). Thus God is said to be good by substance, whereas
- |2
                      creatures are called good because they come from his goodness and
- |2
                      participate in it. This is shown by their tendency to goodness. They are
- |2
                      “similar to the primal goodness” and hence are called
- |2
                      good in reference to it.This rests on the Neo-Platonic notion that by partic- ipation the intelligible, divine world descends
- |2
                      into matter. The former is the archetype, the latter is its image, and
- |2
                      as such it is the visible representation of spiritual realities.In the Byzantine world this same principle was used by Saint John Damascene
- |2
                      to defend the cult of sacred images. The prototype really exists in its
- |2
                      image, he contended. Hence Christ and the saints are really pres- ent in icons; they are there by way of image
- |2
                      (εἰκονικός).
- |2
                      Thus an icon is a visible means by which God can be sensibly worshiped. An
- |2
                      icon contains its subject “sacramentally.” It is a part of
- |2
                      the heavenly world projected into the earthly. As such, it is the seat of
- |2
                      spiritual powers which are communicated to a worshiper suita- bly disposed to receive them.The iconoclasts of the East dismissed these ideas as essentially pagan and
- |2
                      forbade the making of icons. The Western Church at the time of Charlemagne
- |2
                          consid- ered sacred images useful as
- |2
                      adornments and as instructive in historical matters. But the Libri Carolini
- |2
                      forbade the worship of images as repositories of spirit- ual powers. At this period the West had
- |2
                      no interest in, or understanding of, the Christian Neo-Platonic
- |2
                      interpretation of images as projections of spiritual forces into matter. It
- |2
                      was scarcely ready to receive the works of John Scotus Erigena, who a
- |2
                      century after Charlemagne translated into Latin the Corpus Dionysiacum and incorporated Denis' Christian Neo- Platonism into his own writings.The patristic theme of the symbolic value of visible creation for the
- |2
                      revelation of God was familiar to writers of the eleventh and twelfth
- |2
                      centuries. Thus Hugh of Saint Victor compares the sensible universe to
- |2
                      a book written by the finger of God. Everything in it is a figure, not
- |2
                      invented by human ingenuity, but instituted by the divine will, in order to
- |2
                      manifest and signify in some way the hidden attributes of God. Alain
- |2
                      of Lille puts this notion in poetry: Omnis mundi cre- atura/ Quasi liber et pictura/ Nobis est
- |2
                          et speculum (Rythmus; PL 210, 579).
- |2
                      Aelred of Rievaulx speaks of the visible world as the first garment of God,
- |2
                      the second being Scripture.Cosmological analogies, often borrowed from bibli-
- |2
                      cal and classical sources, abound in early medieval writings. Thus
- |2
                      Macrobius speaks of the glory of God illuminating the whole world
- |2
                      “as one face fills many mirrors placed in due order.”
- |2
                      Alain of Lille compares the universe to a feudal city, with its
- |2
                      periphery inverted. The empyrean is the central castle where the
- |2
                      emperor (God) sits enthroned. The lower heaven is occupied by the angelic
- |2
                      knighthood; while we on earth are outside the city wall. These are but two
- |2
                      aspects of the “discarded image” of the Middle Ages
- |2
                      (to use C. S. Lewis' phrase). Both, incidentally, appear in Dante's
- |2
                          Divine Comedy.Political and ecclesiastical analogies played signifi- cant roles in medieval society. In the twelfth
- |2
                      century the term “mystical body of Christ,”
- |2
                      previously applied to the consecrated host, was gradually transferred
- |2
                      to the Christian people, whose head is Christ. By analogy this
- |2
                      theological notion was then applied to the body politic, which was called
- |2
                      “the mystical body of the commonweal.” Secular rulers
- |2
                      borrowed the insignia of spiritual dignitaries; kings were thought of as
- |2
                      married to their realms as Christ is married to the Church. In the
- |2
                      English Tudor period this developed into the notion of “the
- |2
                      King's two bodies”—his natural body and his body
- |2
                      politic. On the other hand, medieval spiritual leaders borrowed the symbols
- |2
                      of the secular powers. The pope, for example, was called
- |2
                      “prince” and “true emperor” in
- |2
                      the later Middle Ages.The logical basis of such analogies occupied early medieval logicians such
- |2
                      as Abelard. Discussing the transference (transumptio) of terms, he points out that
- |2
                          3. The Late Middle Ages.
- |2
                       With the discovery of the complete works of Aristotle in the twelfth
- |2
                      and thir- teenth centuries, medieval theories
- |2
                      of analogy came more decisively under his influence. No less than the
- |2
                      Church Fathers, the scholastics of the later Middle Ages viewed the
- |2
                      universe through religious eyes. For them, too, the universe bears witness
- |2
                      to the existence and attributes of its creator. But under the impact
- |2
                      of Aristotelianism, a Christian naturalism arose that accorded to the
- |2
                      universe a secular dimension unknown to the early Middle Ages. Creatures
- |2
                      were not pure symbols: transparent films, so to
- |2
                      speak, through which God's glory shines. They were created natures
- |2
                      with values and ends of their own, though subordinate to their
- |2
                      creator. The scholastic doctrines of analogy (es-
- |2
                          pecially that of Saint Thomas Aquinas) were designed to express
- |2
                      this fact.No scholastic caught the spirit of the Fathers better than Saint
- |2
                      Bonaventure. His Journey of the Mind to God traces
- |2
                      the stages by which the human mind ascends to its creator. The first stage
- |2
                      is the discovery of God's “footprints” (vestigia) in the sensible world. Like a mirror this
- |2
                      world reflects its creator in a distant way, e.g., through its being or
- |2
                      existence. He is seen more closely and intimately through his image im- planted in the spiritual soul. The sensible
- |2
                      world is an exterior “book,” the mind an interior
- |2
                      one, in which its creator can be read.Bonaventure distinguishes between two kinds of analogy. The first is based
- |2
                      on the unequal participation of several things in one nature, as both man
- |2
                      and dog are called animals, though man possesses animal nature more
- |2
                      perfectly. The second is based on the unity not of nature, but of
- |2
                      proportional likeness. This is the kind of analogy between God and
- |2
                      creatures. They do not participate in one nature but there is a
- |2
                      proportional similitude between them. Hence terms such as “good- ness” can be predicated by
- |2
                      analogy of both of them. Proportional unity is sometimes found among crea- tures; e.g., “light”
- |2
                      is predicated of heavenly and earthly bodies, not because they share in one
- |2
                      nature but be- cause of their proportional
- |2
                      likeness. Analogy always
- |2
                       implies similarity and dissimilarity; in the case of God and
- |2
                      creatures the dissimilarity is greater than the similarity.For Saint Thomas Aquinas, as for Saint Bonaventure, names apply to God and
- |2
                      creatures only by analogy. Names cannot be predicated of them univocally,
- |2
                      i.e., in entirely the same sense, for this would imply that they have
- |2
                      a nature in common. Aquinas defines a univocal term as one whose meaning is
- |2
                      entirely the same when predicated of several things; e.g.,
- |2
                      “animal” predicated of horse and cow. An equivocal
- |2
                      term is attributed to several things with entirely different meanings;
- |2
                      e.g., “dog” predicated of the animal and the
- |2
                      constellation. Analogous terms are predicated of sev-
- |2
                          eral subjects with a meaning that is partly the same and partly
- |2
                      different. More precisely, their meaning is absolutely (simpliciter) different and relatively or pro- portionately (secundum quid)
- |2
                      the same. For example, both animals and food are called healthy:
- |2
                      animals because they possess health in the proper sense of the term,
- |2
                      food because it is a cause of health.Thus predication by analogy means predication ac-
- |2
                          cording to a relation or proportion. This may be a relation of
- |2
                      one thing to another, as in the above exam- ple
- |2
                      of health. Or it may be a likeness of proportions, or proportionality;
- |2
                      e.g., “sight” is attributed to both the eye and the
- |2
                      intellect, because as sight is in the eye, so understanding is in the mind
- |2
                      (Saint Thomas Aquinas, On Truth, 2, 11). In some
- |2
                      proportionalities names are transferred to things to which they do not
- |2
                      properly belong, the transference being justified by a similarity of
- |2
                      effects. For example, God is called a “sun” because
- |2
                      he is the source of spiritual life as the sun is the source of physical
- |2
                      life. Such a transference of a name Thomas calls a metaphor. He points out
- |2
                      that Scripture contains many metaphors of corporeal prop- erties being transferred to spiritual realities
- |2
                      because of a dynamic likeness. Thus grace is said to efface spiritual
- |2
                      stains as water washes away bodily stains.In other proportionalities there is no figurative transference of terms. The
- |2
                      term is ascribed to several things in its proper sense, though they possess
- |2
                      the property denoted by the term in different modes. Thus
- |2
                      “being” is ascribed to man and stone in its proper
- |2
                      sense, but their being is only proportionately the same, for each
- |2
                      exists or is a being in proportion to its nature. Similarly
- |2
                      “goodness” is attributed to God and creatures in its
- |2
                      proper sense, though God possesses goodness in a higher mode than
- |2
                      creatures.The Thomistic doctrine of analogy makes it possible to speak meaningfully of
- |2
                      God and to establish a theol- ogy, i.e., a
- |2
                      science of God. But it does not allow us to know what God is in himself.
- |2
                      Our knowledge of God is either negative (as when we know that he isDuns Scotus, on the contrary, contended that nega-
- |2
                      tive and analogical knowledge of God presupposes more basic univocal
- |2
                      concepts of God and creatures. He argued that we cannot know what God is
- |2
                      not, unless we first know what he is. Hence we must conceive God
- |2
                      through positive concepts, derived from creatures, which apply to them in
- |2
                      exactly the same sense. Exam- ples of such
- |2
                      univocal concepts are “being” and the transcendental
- |2
                      properties of being such as “goodness.” Scotus also
- |2
                      argued that we cannot know God by anal- ogy with
- |2
                      creatures unless we know the two terms of the analogy, and for this we need
- |2
                      absolute (i.e., nonre- lational) concepts
- |2
                      of what God is in himself. Such knowledge is given through univocal
- |2
                      concepts, espe- cially that of being. For
- |2
                      Scotus, however, being is a univocal concept only when abstracted from all
- |2
                      its modalities. When beings are considered as they actu- ally exist, they are either infinite and uncreated
- |2
                      being (God), or they are finite and created being (creatures). Thus
- |2
                      conceived, they are beings only by analogy.Toward the close of the Middle Ages theories of analogy came more strongly
- |2
                      under the influence of Neo-Platonism. In particular, there was a revival
- |2
                      of Boethian and Dionysian perspectives on analogy in the works of
- |2
                      Eckhart and Nicholas of Cusa.For Master Eckhart God is the analogous cause of creatures. Since there is
- |2
                      both similarity and dissimilar- ity
- |2
                      between the creator and his creatures, names given to them in common, such
- |2
                      as “unity,” “being,” and
- |2
                      “goodness,” are neither univocal nor equivocal but
- |2
                      analogous. Things participate in the divine perfections but they do not
- |2
                      possess them as their own. In them- selves
- |2
                      they are pure nothingness. They are said to be, to be one or good, only in
- |2
                      reference to God, who alone is Being, Unity, and Goodness. These
- |2
                      perfections are ascribed to creatures entirely from without and they
- |2
                      never positively take root in them.Nicholas of Cusa resorted to symbolism to arrive at a knowledge of spiritual
- |2
                      realities. Convinced that the visible universe is a faithful reflection of
- |2
                      the invisible divine world, he thought it legitimate to use images to
- |2
                      reach the latter analogically. He praised the Platon- ists, especially Augustine and Boethius, for
- |2
                      realizing that the most perfect images of spiritual realities are
- |2
                      drawn from mathematics—the science that gives the greatest
- |2
                      certitude. Cusa himself often used mathe-
- |2
                      matical symbols in his mystical ascent to God. Thus for him the
- |2
                      coincidence of an infinite straight line with an infinite circle and
- |2
                      triangle shows by analogy the coincidence of opposites in the infinite God

  \               ANALOGY IN PATRISTICAND MEDIEVAL THOUGHT\n                \n                The
  middle Ages made abundant use of analogy and\n                    symbolism in all
  aspects of its culture. Indeed, its mentality has rightly\n                    been
  described as symbolic. At the end of the Middle Ages Dante's Divine Comedy perfectly
  expresses this mentality;\n                    but as early as the first centuries
  after Christ the bases of medieval\n                        sym- bolism were laid
  down by the Church\n                    Fathers.\n                \n                        1.
  The Patristic Period.\n                     The Fathers of the Church cultivated
  symbolism both as a means of\n                    interpreting Scripture and of
  understanding the world and God, its\n                    transcendent cause. Influenced
  by Philo, Clement of Alexandria makes\n                    frequent use of symbolism.
  For him, symbolism expresses the basic unity in\n                    all things,
  de- spite their multiplicity and\n                    diversity. Invisible harmo-
  nies, likenesses,\n                    and proportions bind the universe to- gether,\n
  \                   and these can be interpreted by symbols and allegories. Thus
  symbolism\n                    reveals the hidden connec- tion between\n                    things
  and points to their underlying unity. Allegorical interpretation of\n                    Scripture
  is needed because its truth is veiled in symbols. Clement\n                    justifies
  the concealing of truth in symbols as a means of giving\n                    truth
  greater power over minds. Moreover, by their ambiguity symbols\n                    contain
  a richness and complexity of meaning, in contrast to clear\n                    statements,
  that convey but one message to the reader.\n                Clement's pupil, Origen,
  distinguishes between the literal or historical\n                    meaning of
  Scripture and its spirit- ual or\n                    allegorical meaning. The spiritual
  sense, lying beneath the obvious,\n                    literal meaning, is the one
  princi- pally\n                    intended by the Holy Spirit, the main author
  of Scripture, and it can be\n                    grasped only by the enlight- ened
  and\n                    initiated.\n                For Origen, the allegorical
  interpretation of Scrip-\n                        ture is justified by the fact
  that the cosmos itself is a vast\n                    set of symbols created by
  God to lead the mind to him. Visible nature is a\n                    symbol of
  the invisible world in which each individual has its ideal model\n                    or
  type. Hence all things, Scripture included, have two facets: one\n                    corporeal
  and sensible, the other spiritual and mystical. Because God is\n                    the
  author of both Scripture and Nature, we should except similar problems\n                    in
  understanding them (De principiis IV, 1,\n                    7). Like Scripture,
  nature is a sacred mystery that can be best\n                    expressed by symbols.
  Only by deciphering the imprint left by God on the\n                    world can
  we raise ourselves to the transcendent, invisible world; for God\n                    has
  so ordered his creation, has so linked the lower to the higher by\n                    subtle
  signatures and affinities, that the world we see is, as it were, a\n                    great
  staircase by which the mind of man must climb upwards to spiritual\n                        intelli-
  gence (In\n                        canticum canticorum 3).\n                \n                 Cosmic
  symbolism was most clearly expressed for the Middle Ages by Denis,\n                    the
  Pseudo-Areopagite (fifth century A.D.). The word\n                    ἀναλογία\n
  \                   often appears in his writings, generally with the meaning of
  relation\n                    or proportion. The proportion denoted by the term
  is not abstract or\n                    mathematical but the concrete relation of
  love between creatures and God.\n                    On the one hand, it means the
  creature's desire for deification, and,\n                    on the other, God's
  appearance (theophany) to creatures. Denis also\n                    uses the term
  to denote the divine ideas, which define the creature's\n                    position
  in the hierarchy of creation and his capacity to receive divine\n                    gifts.
  It also means the creature's capacity for these gifts and his\n                    loving
  response to God.\n                For Denis a symbol\n                    (σύμβολον)\n
  \                   is the relating or adapting of visible forms in order to reveal\n
  \                   something invisible. Symbols are “unlike likenesses,”\n                    and
  hence when applied to God they both conceal and reveal him. No\n                    symbol,
  however, can give us a positive knowledge of the divinity.\n                    Following
  Plotinus and Proclus he conceives God as infinite and one, trans- cending being
  or reality and every\n                    conceivable positive perfection. As infinite,
  he is strictly inimitable by\n                        any- thing finite; and yet
  the finite\n                    universe participates in his riches. This justifies
  our giving positive\n                    names to him, such as “goodness” and\n
  \                   “being.” More suitable are negative names like\n                    “one”
  and “infinite.” More\n                    appropriate still are superlative names
  like “super- good” and\n                    “super-being.” In the end we know God
  best by\n                    realizing our ignorance of him (Divine Names 7, 3;\n
  \                   PG 3, 872B).\n                Following Cicero and the Latin
  grammarians, the Latin Fathers used proportio as the equivalent of\n                    ἀναλογία.\n
  \                   In the broad sense it meant any likeness or comparison; more
  strictly it\n                    denoted a likeness or identity of proportions:
  as a\n                    is to b, so c is to d. For Saint Augustine analogy is
  a method of\n                    scriptural in- terpretation by which the\n                    harmony
  of the Old and New Testaments is established. This differs from\n                    allegory,
  which reveals the figurative, as opposed to the literal,\n                    sense
  of Scripture. In the strict sense, Augustine denies that there is an\n                    analogy
  between the trinity of faculties of the soul (memory, intelligence,\n                    and
  will) and the trinity of divine Persons, because this is not a\n                    true
  comparison between them leading to a knowledge of the Trinity\n                        (Sermo
  52, 10; PL 38, 364).\n                Augustine prefers the term “sign” to\n                    “analogy.”
  A sign is any word or thing that leads to\n                    a knowledge of something
  else. If it points to the divine, it is asacramentum. The universe itself is holy
  (a\n                    sacrament), for it contains signs leading the mind above
  itself to\n                    God. Words have a proper meaning (signa propria)
  but\n                    they also have a figurative sense (signa translata),\n
  \                   expressing the mysteries hidden within things. In the065\n                     interpretation
  of Scripture and in the study of nature he has\n                    recourse to
  allegory and symbols drawn from both biblical and classical\n                    sources.
  Numbers, for exam- ple, have mysterious\n                    and symbolic meanings.\n
  \               The Dionysian and Augustinian symbolism derive from Neo-Platonism,
  though\n                    the former places more emphasis on cosmic symbolism
  and the latter on\n                    the symbolic value of human signs and history
  as instru- ments of spiritual experience. Both tend to devalue\n                    the
  physical contents of reality and the importance of scientific\n                    explanation
  through intrinsic causes, and to place the true significance of\n                    reality
  in its essential reference to the transcendent God.\n                \n                        2.
  The Early Middle Ages.\n                     Like Augustine, Boethius transmitted
  classical philosophical ideas to\n                    the Middle Ages. In his logical
  works he translates\n                    ἀναλογία ascomparatio or proportio,\n                    ἀναλογον\n
  \                   as proportionale. Proportio he defines as the\n                    comparison
  of similar things. For example, there is a proportion between\n                    the
  relation of 4 to 2 and 40 to 20. Similarly genus is related to\n                    specific
  difference as matter is related to form, e.g., animality to\n                    rationality
  in the definition of man.\n                When treating of our knowledge of God,
  Boethius does not appeal to this\n                    Aristotelian type of analogy
  but to the Platonic notions of participation\n                    and image. This
  is because he denies any comparison between the\n                    infinite and
  finite (De consolatione philosophiae\n                    II, prose 7). Thus God
  is said to be good by substance, whereas\n                    creatures are called
  good because they come from his goodness and\n                    participate in
  it. This is shown by their tendency to goodness. They are\n                    “similar
  to the primal goodness” and hence are called\n                    good in reference
  to it.\n                This rests on the Neo-Platonic notion that by partic- ipation
  the intelligible, divine world descends\n                    into matter. The former
  is the archetype, the latter is its image, and\n                    as such it is
  the visible representation of spiritual realities.\n                In the Byzantine
  world this same principle was used by Saint John Damascene\n                    to
  defend the cult of sacred images. The prototype really exists in its\n                    image,
  he contended. Hence Christ and the saints are really pres- ent in icons; they are
  there by way of image\n                    (εἰκονικός).\n                    Thus
  an icon is a visible means by which God can be sensibly worshiped. An\n                    icon
  contains its subject “sacramentally.” It is a part of\n                    the heavenly
  world projected into the earthly. As such, it is the seat of\n                    spiritual
  powers which are communicated to a worshiper suita- bly disposed to receive them.\n
  \               The iconoclasts of the East dismissed these ideas as essentially
  pagan and\n                    forbade the making of icons. The Western Church at
  the time of Charlemagne\n                        consid- ered sacred images useful
  as\n                    adornments and as instructive in historical matters. But
  the Libri Carolini\n                    forbade the worship of images as repositories
  of spirit- ual powers. At this period the West had\n                    no interest
  in, or understanding of, the Christian Neo-Platonic\n                    interpretation
  of images as projections of spiritual forces into matter. It\n                    was
  scarcely ready to receive the works of John Scotus Erigena, who a\n                    century
  after Charlemagne translated into Latin the Corpus Dionysiacum and incorporated
  Denis' Christian Neo- Platonism into his own writings.\n                The patristic
  theme of the symbolic value of visible creation for the\n                    revelation
  of God was familiar to writers of the eleventh and twelfth\n                    centuries.
  Thus Hugh of Saint Victor compares the sensible universe to\n                    a
  book written by the finger of God. Everything in it is a figure, not\n                    invented
  by human ingenuity, but instituted by the divine will, in order to\n                    manifest
  and signify in some way the hidden attributes of God. Alain\n                    of
  Lille puts this notion in poetry: Omnis mundi cre- atura/ Quasi liber et pictura/
  Nobis est\n                        et speculum (Rythmus; PL 210, 579).\n                    Aelred
  of Rievaulx speaks of the visible world as the first garment of God,\n                    the
  second being Scripture.\n                Cosmological analogies, often borrowed
  from bibli-\n                    cal and classical sources, abound in early medieval
  writings. Thus\n                    Macrobius speaks of the glory of God illuminating
  the whole world\n                    “as one face fills many mirrors placed in due
  order.”\n                    Alain of Lille compares the universe to a feudal city,
  with its\n                    periphery inverted. The empyrean is the central castle
  where the\n                    emperor (God) sits enthroned. The lower heaven is
  occupied by the angelic\n                    knighthood; while we on earth are outside
  the city wall. These are but two\n                    aspects of the “discarded
  image” of the Middle Ages\n                    (to use C. S. Lewis' phrase). Both,
  incidentally, appear in Dante's\n                        Divine Comedy.\n                Political
  and ecclesiastical analogies played signifi- cant roles in medieval society. In
  the twelfth\n                    century the term “mystical body of Christ,”\n                    previously
  applied to the consecrated host, was gradually transferred\n                    to
  the Christian people, whose head is Christ. By analogy this\n                    theological
  notion was then applied to the body politic, which was called\n                    “the
  mystical body of the commonweal.” Secular rulers\n                    borrowed the
  insignia of spiritual dignitaries; kings were thought of as\n                    married
  to their realms as Christ is married to the Church. In the\n                    English
  Tudor period this developed into the notion of “the\n                    King's
  two bodies”—his natural body and his body\n                    politic. On the other
  hand, medieval spiritual leaders borrowed the symbols\n                    of the
  secular powers. The pope, for example, was called\n                    “prince”
  and “true emperor” in\n                    the later Middle Ages.\n                The
  logical basis of such analogies occupied early medieval logicians such\n                    as
  Abelard. Discussing the transference (transumptio) of terms, he points out that066\n
  \                    a term that principally signifies one thing may be applied
  to\n                    another because of some likeness. Thus we can say “The meadow\n
  \                   smiles,” transferring “smiles” from its\n                    proper
  usage to a metaphorical one. Rules were laid down for arguments\n                    based
  on such transfer- ence of terms.\n                    Abelard bases the argument
  by analogy on the maxim: “What occurs\n                    in the case of some pro-
  portional things\n                    happens in others.” Thus one can argue that
  the ruler of a city\n                    should not be chosen by lot but for his
  knowledge, for this is how the\n                    pilot of a ship should be chosen
  (Dialectica, ed. De\n                    Rijk, p. 442).\n                \n                        3.
  The Late Middle Ages.\n                     With the discovery of the complete works
  of Aristotle in the twelfth\n                    and thir- teenth centuries, medieval
  theories\n                    of analogy came more decisively under his influence.
  No less than the\n                    Church Fathers, the scholastics of the later
  Middle Ages viewed the\n                    universe through religious eyes. For
  them, too, the universe bears witness\n                    to the existence and
  attributes of its creator. But under the impact\n                    of Aristotelianism,
  a Christian naturalism arose that accorded to the\n                    universe
  a secular dimension unknown to the early Middle Ages. Creatures\n                    were
  not pure symbols: transparent films, so to\n                    speak, through which
  God's glory shines. They were created natures\n                    with values and
  ends of their own, though subordinate to their\n                    creator. The
  scholastic doctrines of analogy (es-\n                        pecially that of Saint
  Thomas Aquinas) were designed to express\n                    this fact.\n                No
  scholastic caught the spirit of the Fathers better than Saint\n                    Bonaventure.
  His Journey of the Mind to God traces\n                    the stages by which the
  human mind ascends to its creator. The first stage\n                    is the discovery
  of God's “footprints” (vestigia) in the sensible world. Like a mirror this\n                    world
  reflects its creator in a distant way, e.g., through its being or\n                    existence.
  He is seen more closely and intimately through his image im- planted in the spiritual
  soul. The sensible\n                    world is an exterior “book,” the mind an
  interior\n                    one, in which its creator can be read.\n                Bonaventure
  distinguishes between two kinds of analogy. The first is based\n                    on
  the unequal participation of several things in one nature, as both man\n                    and
  dog are called animals, though man possesses animal nature more\n                    perfectly.
  The second is based on the unity not of nature, but of\n                    proportional
  likeness. This is the kind of analogy between God and\n                    creatures.
  They do not participate in one nature but there is a\n                    proportional
  similitude between them. Hence terms such as “good- ness” can be predicated by\n
  \                   analogy of both of them. Proportional unity is sometimes found
  among crea- tures; e.g., “light”\n                    is predicated of heavenly
  and earthly bodies, not because they share in one\n                    nature but
  be- cause of their proportional\n                    likeness. Analogy always\n
  \                    implies similarity and dissimilarity; in the case of God and\n
  \                   creatures the dissimilarity is greater than the similarity.\n
  \               For Saint Thomas Aquinas, as for Saint Bonaventure, names apply
  to God and\n                    creatures only by analogy. Names cannot be predicated
  of them univocally,\n                    i.e., in entirely the same sense, for this
  would imply that they have\n                    a nature in common. Aquinas defines
  a univocal term as one whose meaning is\n                    entirely the same when
  predicated of several things; e.g.,\n                    “animal” predicated of
  horse and cow. An equivocal\n                    term is attributed to several things
  with entirely different meanings;\n                    e.g., “dog” predicated of
  the animal and the\n                    constellation. Analogous terms are predicated
  of sev-\n                        eral subjects with a meaning that is partly the
  same and partly\n                    different. More precisely, their meaning is
  absolutely (simpliciter) different and relatively or pro- portionately (secundum
  quid)\n                    the same. For example, both animals and food are called
  healthy:\n                    animals because they possess health in the proper
  sense of the term,\n                    food because it is a cause of health.\n
  \               Thus predication by analogy means predication ac-\n                        cording
  to a relation or proportion. This may be a relation of\n                    one
  thing to another, as in the above exam- ple\n                    of health. Or it
  may be a likeness of proportions, or proportionality;\n                    e.g.,
  “sight” is attributed to both the eye and the\n                    intellect, because
  as sight is in the eye, so understanding is in the mind\n                    (Saint
  Thomas Aquinas, On Truth, 2, 11). In some\n                    proportionalities
  names are transferred to things to which they do not\n                    properly
  belong, the transference being justified by a similarity of\n                    effects.
  For example, God is called a “sun” because\n                    he is the source
  of spiritual life as the sun is the source of physical\n                    life.
  Such a transference of a name Thomas calls a metaphor. He points out\n                    that
  Scripture contains many metaphors of corporeal prop- erties being transferred to
  spiritual realities\n                    because of a dynamic likeness. Thus grace
  is said to efface spiritual\n                    stains as water washes away bodily
  stains.\n                In other proportionalities there is no figurative transference
  of terms. The\n                    term is ascribed to several things in its proper
  sense, though they possess\n                    the property denoted by the term
  in different modes. Thus\n                    “being” is ascribed to man and stone
  in its proper\n                    sense, but their being is only proportionately
  the same, for each\n                    exists or is a being in proportion to its
  nature. Similarly\n                    “goodness” is attributed to God and creatures
  in its\n                    proper sense, though God possesses goodness in a higher
  mode than\n                    creatures.\n                The Thomistic doctrine
  of analogy makes it possible to speak meaningfully of\n                    God and
  to establish a theol- ogy, i.e., a\n                    science of God. But it does
  not allow us to know what God is in himself.\n                    Our knowledge
  of God is either negative (as when we know that he is067\n                     not
  material or not finite), or it is analogical (i.e., he is\n                    known
  insofar as he is represented by creatures by proportional\n                    similitude).\n
  \               Duns Scotus, on the contrary, contended that nega-\n                    tive
  and analogical knowledge of God presupposes more basic univocal\n                    concepts
  of God and creatures. He argued that we cannot know what God is\n                    not,
  unless we first know what he is. Hence we must conceive God\n                    through
  positive concepts, derived from creatures, which apply to them in\n                    exactly
  the same sense. Exam- ples of such\n                    univocal concepts are “being”
  and the transcendental\n                    properties of being such as “goodness.”
  Scotus also\n                    argued that we cannot know God by anal- ogy with\n
  \                   creatures unless we know the two terms of the analogy, and for
  this we need\n                    absolute (i.e., nonre- lational) concepts\n                    of
  what God is in himself. Such knowledge is given through univocal\n                    concepts,
  espe- cially that of being. For\n                    Scotus, however, being is a
  univocal concept only when abstracted from all\n                    its modalities.
  When beings are considered as they actu- ally exist, they are either infinite and
  uncreated\n                    being (God), or they are finite and created being
  (creatures). Thus\n                    conceived, they are beings only by analogy.\n
  \               Toward the close of the Middle Ages theories of analogy came more
  strongly\n                    under the influence of Neo-Platonism. In particular,
  there was a revival\n                    of Boethian and Dionysian perspectives
  on analogy in the works of\n                    Eckhart and Nicholas of Cusa.\n
  \               For Master Eckhart God is the analogous cause of creatures. Since
  there is\n                    both similarity and dissimilar- ity\n                    between
  the creator and his creatures, names given to them in common, such\n                    as
  “unity,” “being,” and\n                    “goodness,” are neither univocal nor
  equivocal but\n                    analogous. Things participate in the divine perfections
  but they do not\n                    possess them as their own. In them- selves\n
  \                   they are pure nothingness. They are said to be, to be one or
  good, only in\n                    reference to God, who alone is Being, Unity,
  and Goodness. These\n                    perfections are ascribed to creatures entirely
  from without and they\n                    never positively take root in them.\n
  \               Nicholas of Cusa resorted to symbolism to arrive at a knowledge
  of spiritual\n                    realities. Convinced that the visible universe
  is a faithful reflection of\n                    the invisible divine world, he
  thought it legitimate to use images to\n                    reach the latter analogically.
  He praised the Platon- ists, especially Augustine and Boethius, for\n                    realizing
  that the most perfect images of spiritual realities are\n                    drawn
  from mathematics—the science that gives the greatest\n                    certitude.
  Cusa himself often used mathe-\n                    matical symbols in his mystical
  ascent to God. Thus for him the\n                    coincidence of an infinite
  straight line with an infinite circle and\n                    triangle shows by
  analogy the coincidence of opposites in the infinite God\n                        (De
  docta ignorantia I, 11-16).\n                \n                \n                    \n

  the History of IdeasThe middle Ages made abundant use of analogy and\n                    symbolism
  in all aspects of its culture. Indeed, its mentality has rightly\n                    been
  described as symbolic. At the end of the Middle Ages Dante's Divine Comedy perfectly
  expresses this mentality;\n                    but as early as the first centuries
  after Christ the bases of medieval\n                        sym- bolism were laid
  down by the Church\n                    Fathers.\n                        1. The
  Patristic Period.\n                     The Fathers of the Church cultivated symbolism
  both as a means of\n                    interpreting Scripture and of understanding
  the world and God, its\n                    transcendent cause. Influenced by Philo,
  Clement of Alexandria makes\n                    frequent use of symbolism. For
  him, symbolism expresses the basic unity in\n                    all things, de-
  spite their multiplicity and\n                    diversity. Invisible harmo- nies,
  likenesses,\n                    and proportions bind the universe to- gether,\n
  \                   and these can be interpreted by symbols and allegories. Thus
  symbolism\n                    reveals the hidden connec- tion between\n                    things
  and points to their underlying unity. Allegorical interpretation of\n                    Scripture
  is needed because its truth is veiled in symbols. Clement\n                    justifies
  the concealing of truth in symbols as a means of giving\n                    truth
  greater power over minds. Moreover, by their ambiguity symbols\n                    contain
  a richness and complexity of meaning, in contrast to clear\n                    statements,
  that convey but one message to the reader.Clement's pupil, Origen, distinguishes
  between the literal or historical\n                    meaning of Scripture and
  its spirit- ual or\n                    allegorical meaning. The spiritual sense,
  lying beneath the obvious,\n                    literal meaning, is the one princi-
  pally\n                    intended by the Holy Spirit, the main author of Scripture,
  and it can be\n                    grasped only by the enlight- ened and\n                    initiated.For
  Origen, the allegorical interpretation of Scrip-\n                        ture is
  justified by the fact that the cosmos itself is a vast\n                    set
  of symbols created by God to lead the mind to him. Visible nature is a\n                    symbol
  of the invisible world in which each individual has its ideal model\n                    or
  type. Hence all things, Scripture included, have two facets: one\n                    corporeal
  and sensible, the other spiritual and mystical. Because God is\n                    the
  author of both Scripture and Nature, we should except similar problems\n                    in
  understanding them (De principiis IV, 1,\n                    7). Like Scripture,
  nature is a sacred mystery that can be best\n                    expressed by symbols.
  Only by deciphering the imprint left by God on the\n                    world can
  we raise ourselves to the transcendent, invisible world; for God\n                    has
  so ordered his creation, has so linked the lower to the higher by\n                    subtle
  signatures and affinities, that the world we see is, as it were, a\n                    great
  staircase by which the mind of man must climb upwards to spiritual\n                        intelli-
  gence (In\n                        canticum canticorum 3). Cosmic symbolism was
  most clearly expressed for the Middle Ages by Denis,\n                    the Pseudo-Areopagite
  (fifth century A.D.). The word\n                    ἀναλογία\n                    often
  appears in his writings, generally with the meaning of relation\n                    or
  proportion. The proportion denoted by the term is not abstract or\n                    mathematical
  but the concrete relation of love between creatures and God.\n                    On
  the one hand, it means the creature's desire for deification, and,\n                    on
  the other, God's appearance (theophany) to creatures. Denis also\n                    uses
  the term to denote the divine ideas, which define the creature's\n                    position
  in the hierarchy of creation and his capacity to receive divine\n                    gifts.
  It also means the creature's capacity for these gifts and his\n                    loving
  response to God.For Denis a symbol\n                    (σύμβολον)\n                    is
  the relating or adapting of visible forms in order to reveal\n                    something
  invisible. Symbols are “unlike likenesses,”\n                    and hence when
  applied to God they both conceal and reveal him. No\n                    symbol,
  however, can give us a positive knowledge of the divinity.\n                    Following
  Plotinus and Proclus he conceives God as infinite and one, trans- cending being
  or reality and every\n                    conceivable positive perfection. As infinite,
  he is strictly inimitable by\n                        any- thing finite; and yet
  the finite\n                    universe participates in his riches. This justifies
  our giving positive\n                    names to him, such as “goodness” and\n
  \                   “being.” More suitable are negative names like\n                    “one”
  and “infinite.” More\n                    appropriate still are superlative names
  like “super- good” and\n                    “super-being.” In the end we know God
  best by\n                    realizing our ignorance of him (Divine Names 7, 3;\n
  \                   PG 3, 872B).Following Cicero and the Latin grammarians, the
  Latin Fathers used proportio as the equivalent of\n                    ἀναλογία.\n
  \                   In the broad sense it meant any likeness or comparison; more
  strictly it\n                    denoted a likeness or identity of proportions:
  as a\n                    is to b, so c is to d. For Saint Augustine analogy is
  a method of\n                    scriptural in- terpretation by which the\n                    harmony
  of the Old and New Testaments is established. This differs from\n                    allegory,
  which reveals the figurative, as opposed to the literal,\n                    sense
  of Scripture. In the strict sense, Augustine denies that there is an\n                    analogy
  between the trinity of faculties of the soul (memory, intelligence,\n                    and
  will) and the trinity of divine Persons, because this is not a\n                    true
  comparison between them leading to a knowledge of the Trinity\n                        (Sermo
  52, 10; PL 38, 364).Augustine prefers the term “sign” to\n                    “analogy.”
  A sign is any word or thing that leads to\n                    a knowledge of something
  else. If it points to the divine, it is asacramentum. The universe itself is holy
  (a\n                    sacrament), for it contains signs leading the mind above
  itself to\n                    God. Words have a proper meaning (signa propria)
  but\n                    they also have a figurative sense (signa translata),\n
  \                   expressing the mysteries hidden within things. In theThe Dionysian
  and Augustinian symbolism derive from Neo-Platonism, though\n                    the
  former places more emphasis on cosmic symbolism and the latter on\n                    the
  symbolic value of human signs and history as instru- ments of spiritual experience.
  Both tend to devalue\n                    the physical contents of reality and the
  importance of scientific\n                    explanation through intrinsic causes,
  and to place the true significance of\n                    reality in its essential
  reference to the transcendent God.\n                        2. The Early Middle
  Ages.\n                     Like Augustine, Boethius transmitted classical philosophical
  ideas to\n                    the Middle Ages. In his logical works he translates\n
  \                   ἀναλογία ascomparatio or proportio,\n                    ἀναλογον\n
  \                   as proportionale. Proportio he defines as the\n                    comparison
  of similar things. For example, there is a proportion between\n                    the
  relation of 4 to 2 and 40 to 20. Similarly genus is related to\n                    specific
  difference as matter is related to form, e.g., animality to\n                    rationality
  in the definition of man.When treating of our knowledge of God, Boethius does not
  appeal to this\n                    Aristotelian type of analogy but to the Platonic
  notions of participation\n                    and image. This is because he denies
  any comparison between the\n                    infinite and finite (De consolatione
  philosophiae\n                    II, prose 7). Thus God is said to be good by substance,
  whereas\n                    creatures are called good because they come from his
  goodness and\n                    participate in it. This is shown by their tendency
  to goodness. They are\n                    “similar to the primal goodness” and
  hence are called\n                    good in reference to it.This rests on the
  Neo-Platonic notion that by partic- ipation the intelligible, divine world descends\n
  \                   into matter. The former is the archetype, the latter is its
  image, and\n                    as such it is the visible representation of spiritual
  realities.In the Byzantine world this same principle was used by Saint John Damascene\n
  \                   to defend the cult of sacred images. The prototype really exists
  in its\n                    image, he contended. Hence Christ and the saints are
  really pres- ent in icons; they are there by way of image\n                    (εἰκονικός).\n
  \                   Thus an icon is a visible means by which God can be sensibly
  worshiped. An\n                    icon contains its subject “sacramentally.” It
  is a part of\n                    the heavenly world projected into the earthly.
  As such, it is the seat of\n                    spiritual powers which are communicated
  to a worshiper suita- bly disposed to receive them.The iconoclasts of the East dismissed
  these ideas as essentially pagan and\n                    forbade the making of
  icons. The Western Church at the time of Charlemagne\n                        consid-
  ered sacred images useful as\n                    adornments and as instructive
  in historical matters. But the Libri Carolini\n                    forbade the worship
  of images as repositories of spirit- ual powers. At this period the West had\n                    no
  interest in, or understanding of, the Christian Neo-Platonic\n                    interpretation
  of images as projections of spiritual forces into matter. It\n                    was
  scarcely ready to receive the works of John Scotus Erigena, who a\n                    century
  after Charlemagne translated into Latin the Corpus Dionysiacum and incorporated
  Denis' Christian Neo- Platonism into his own writings.The patristic theme of the
  symbolic value of visible creation for the\n                    revelation of God
  was familiar to writers of the eleventh and twelfth\n                    centuries.
  Thus Hugh of Saint Victor compares the sensible universe to\n                    a
  book written by the finger of God. Everything in it is a figure, not\n                    invented
  by human ingenuity, but instituted by the divine will, in order to\n                    manifest
  and signify in some way the hidden attributes of God. Alain\n                    of
  Lille puts this notion in poetry: Omnis mundi cre- atura/ Quasi liber et pictura/
  Nobis est\n                        et speculum (Rythmus; PL 210, 579).\n                    Aelred
  of Rievaulx speaks of the visible world as the first garment of God,\n                    the
  second being Scripture.Cosmological analogies, often borrowed from bibli-\n                    cal
  and classical sources, abound in early medieval writings. Thus\n                    Macrobius
  speaks of the glory of God illuminating the whole world\n                    “as
  one face fills many mirrors placed in due order.”\n                    Alain of
  Lille compares the universe to a feudal city, with its\n                    periphery
  inverted. The empyrean is the central castle where the\n                    emperor
  (God) sits enthroned. The lower heaven is occupied by the angelic\n                    knighthood;
  while we on earth are outside the city wall. These are but two\n                    aspects
  of the “discarded image” of the Middle Ages\n                    (to use C. S. Lewis'
  phrase). Both, incidentally, appear in Dante's\n                        Divine Comedy.Political
  and ecclesiastical analogies played signifi- cant roles in medieval society. In
  the twelfth\n                    century the term “mystical body of Christ,”\n                    previously
  applied to the consecrated host, was gradually transferred\n                    to
  the Christian people, whose head is Christ. By analogy this\n                    theological
  notion was then applied to the body politic, which was called\n                    “the
  mystical body of the commonweal.” Secular rulers\n                    borrowed the
  insignia of spiritual dignitaries; kings were thought of as\n                    married
  to their realms as Christ is married to the Church. In the\n                    English
  Tudor period this developed into the notion of “the\n                    King's
  two bodies”—his natural body and his body\n                    politic. On the other
  hand, medieval spiritual leaders borrowed the symbols\n                    of the
  secular powers. The pope, for example, was called\n                    “prince”
  and “true emperor” in\n                    the later Middle Ages.The logical basis
  of such analogies occupied early medieval logicians such\n                    as
  Abelard. Discussing the transference (transumptio) of terms, he points out that\n
  \                       3. The Late Middle Ages.\n                     With the
  discovery of the complete works of Aristotle in the twelfth\n                    and
  thir- teenth centuries, medieval theories\n                    of analogy came more
  decisively under his influence. No less than the\n                    Church Fathers,
  the scholastics of the later Middle Ages viewed the\n                    universe
  through religious eyes. For them, too, the universe bears witness\n                    to
  the existence and attributes of its creator. But under the impact\n                    of
  Aristotelianism, a Christian naturalism arose that accorded to the\n                    universe
  a secular dimension unknown to the early Middle Ages. Creatures\n                    were
  not pure symbols: transparent films, so to\n                    speak, through which
  God's glory shines. They were created natures\n                    with values and
  ends of their own, though subordinate to their\n                    creator. The
  scholastic doctrines of analogy (es-\n                        pecially that of Saint
  Thomas Aquinas) were designed to express\n                    this fact.No scholastic
  caught the spirit of the Fathers better than Saint\n                    Bonaventure.
  His Journey of the Mind to God traces\n                    the stages by which the
  human mind ascends to its creator. The first stage\n                    is the discovery
  of God's “footprints” (vestigia) in the sensible world. Like a mirror this\n                    world
  reflects its creator in a distant way, e.g., through its being or\n                    existence.
  He is seen more closely and intimately through his image im- planted in the spiritual
  soul. The sensible\n                    world is an exterior “book,” the mind an
  interior\n                    one, in which its creator can be read.Bonaventure
  distinguishes between two kinds of analogy. The first is based\n                    on
  the unequal participation of several things in one nature, as both man\n                    and
  dog are called animals, though man possesses animal nature more\n                    perfectly.
  The second is based on the unity not of nature, but of\n                    proportional
  likeness. This is the kind of analogy between God and\n                    creatures.
  They do not participate in one nature but there is a\n                    proportional
  similitude between them. Hence terms such as “good- ness” can be predicated by\n
  \                   analogy of both of them. Proportional unity is sometimes found
  among crea- tures; e.g., “light”\n                    is predicated of heavenly
  and earthly bodies, not because they share in one\n                    nature but
  be- cause of their proportional\n                    likeness. Analogy always\n
  \                    implies similarity and dissimilarity; in the case of God and\n
  \                   creatures the dissimilarity is greater than the similarity.For
  Saint Thomas Aquinas, as for Saint Bonaventure, names apply to God and\n                    creatures
  only by analogy. Names cannot be predicated of them univocally,\n                    i.e.,
  in entirely the same sense, for this would imply that they have\n                    a
  nature in common. Aquinas defines a univocal term as one whose meaning is\n                    entirely
  the same when predicated of several things; e.g.,\n                    “animal”
  predicated of horse and cow. An equivocal\n                    term is attributed
  to several things with entirely different meanings;\n                    e.g., “dog”
  predicated of the animal and the\n                    constellation. Analogous terms
  are predicated of sev-\n                        eral subjects with a meaning that
  is partly the same and partly\n                    different. More precisely, their
  meaning is absolutely (simpliciter) different and relatively or pro- portionately
  (secundum quid)\n                    the same. For example, both animals and food
  are called healthy:\n                    animals because they possess health in
  the proper sense of the term,\n                    food because it is a cause of
  health.Thus predication by analogy means predication ac-\n                        cording
  to a relation or proportion. This may be a relation of\n                    one
  thing to another, as in the above exam- ple\n                    of health. Or it
  may be a likeness of proportions, or proportionality;\n                    e.g.,
  “sight” is attributed to both the eye and the\n                    intellect, because
  as sight is in the eye, so understanding is in the mind\n                    (Saint
  Thomas Aquinas, On Truth, 2, 11). In some\n                    proportionalities
  names are transferred to things to which they do not\n                    properly
  belong, the transference being justified by a similarity of\n                    effects.
  For example, God is called a “sun” because\n                    he is the source
  of spiritual life as the sun is the source of physical\n                    life.
  Such a transference of a name Thomas calls a metaphor. He points out\n                    that
  Scripture contains many metaphors of corporeal prop- erties being transferred to
  spiritual realities\n                    because of a dynamic likeness. Thus grace
  is said to efface spiritual\n                    stains as water washes away bodily
  stains.In other proportionalities there is no figurative transference of terms.
  The\n                    term is ascribed to several things in its proper sense,
  though they possess\n                    the property denoted by the term in different
  modes. Thus\n                    “being” is ascribed to man and stone in its proper\n
  \                   sense, but their being is only proportionately the same, for
  each\n                    exists or is a being in proportion to its nature. Similarly\n
  \                   “goodness” is attributed to God and creatures in its\n                    proper
  sense, though God possesses goodness in a higher mode than\n                    creatures.The
  Thomistic doctrine of analogy makes it possible to speak meaningfully of\n                    God
  and to establish a theol- ogy, i.e., a\n                    science of God. But
  it does not allow us to know what God is in himself.\n                    Our knowledge
  of God is either negative (as when we know that he isDuns Scotus, on the contrary,
  contended that nega-\n                    tive and analogical knowledge of God presupposes
  more basic univocal\n                    concepts of God and creatures. He argued
  that we cannot know what God is\n                    not, unless we first know what
  he is. Hence we must conceive God\n                    through positive concepts,
  derived from creatures, which apply to them in\n                    exactly the
  same sense. Exam- ples of such\n                    univocal concepts are “being”
  and the transcendental\n                    properties of being such as “goodness.”
  Scotus also\n                    argued that we cannot know God by anal- ogy with\n
  \                   creatures unless we know the two terms of the analogy, and for
  this we need\n                    absolute (i.e., nonre- lational) concepts\n                    of
  what God is in himself. Such knowledge is given through univocal\n                    concepts,
  espe- cially that of being. For\n                    Scotus, however, being is a
  univocal concept only when abstracted from all\n                    its modalities.
  When beings are considered as they actu- ally exist, they are either infinite and
  uncreated\n                    being (God), or they are finite and created being
  (creatures). Thus\n                    conceived, they are beings only by analogy.Toward
  the close of the Middle Ages theories of analogy came more strongly\n                    under
  the influence of Neo-Platonism. In particular, there was a revival\n                    of
  Boethian and Dionysian perspectives on analogy in the works of\n                    Eckhart
  and Nicholas of Cusa.For Master Eckhart God is the analogous cause of creatures.
  Since there is\n                    both similarity and dissimilar- ity\n                    between
  the creator and his creatures, names given to them in common, such\n                    as
  “unity,” “being,” and\n                    “goodness,” are neither univocal nor
  equivocal but\n                    analogous. Things participate in the divine perfections
  but they do not\n                    possess them as their own. In them- selves\n
  \                   they are pure nothingness. They are said to be, to be one or
  good, only in\n                    reference to God, who alone is Being, Unity,
  and Goodness. These\n                    perfections are ascribed to creatures entirely
  from without and they\n                    never positively take root in them.Nicholas
  of Cusa resorted to symbolism to arrive at a knowledge of spiritual\n                    realities.
  Convinced that the visible universe is a faithful reflection of\n                    the
  invisible divine world, he thought it legitimate to use images to\n                    reach
  the latter analogically. He praised the Platon- ists, especially Augustine and Boethius,
  for\n                    realizing that the most perfect images of spiritual realities
  are\n                    drawn from mathematics—the science that gives the greatest\n
  \                   certitude. Cusa himself often used mathe-\n                    matical
  symbols in his mystical ascent to God. Thus for him the\n                    coincidence
  of an infinite straight line with an infinite circle and\n                    triangle
  shows by analogy the coincidence of opposites in the infinite God\n                        (De
  docta ignorantia I, 11-16).Étienne Gilson, History of Christian Philosophy in\n
