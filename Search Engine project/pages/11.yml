  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- The Indiana University Office of the Vice President for Diversity, Equity and Multicultural Affairs has issued “A Call to All”  -- an invitation for IU Bloomington students, faculty, staff and community members to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Jan. 18 and throughout January.
- |
  “For decades, IU has proudly been part of the nationwide celebration of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,” said Martin McCrory, associate vice president for academic support and diversity, as well as vice provost for educational inclusion and diversity at IU Bloomington. “In choosing ‘A Call to All’ as this year’s theme, we wanted to make it clear that Dr. King’s message and call to action is everyone’s right and responsibility.”
- |
  Information and ways to become involved can be found on IU’s Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration website. Events and opportunities include:
- |
  Building Bridges Award -- This is an opportunity to recognize an individual, group of people or organization that captures King's vision, spirit and leadership. Awards will be given to an undergraduate student; graduate/professional student or student instructor; a faculty member; a staff member; and a community member or organization. The deadline for nominations is Dec. 21. Winners will be announced at IU’s MLK Jr. Celebration Leadership Breakfast. Nominations can be made online.
- |
  “A Day On, Not a Day Off” -- For the 2016 MLK Day, $39,500 was granted and more than 1,500 volunteers are needed to support service and educational projects by local groups and organizations. These include several affiliated with IU, like the Groups Scholars Program, Faculty and Staff for Student Excellence, the School of Education and many more. Learn more about volunteer opportunities online.
- |
  Create your own event -- In the spirit of King, grassroots activities celebrating his legacy are encouraged at IU. Past examples include movie nights, guest lectures and service projects hosted by residence halls, student groups and departments. Everyone is invited to submit and view events online.

  Bloomington issues 'A Call to All' for upcoming MLK DayDec. 9, 2015FOR IMMEDIATE
  RELEASE\nBLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- The Indiana University Office of the Vice President
  for Diversity, Equity and Multicultural Affairs has issued “A Call to All”  -- an
  invitation for IU Bloomington students, faculty, staff and community members to
  celebrate the 30th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Jan. 18 and throughout
  January.\n“For decades, IU has proudly been part of the nationwide celebration of
  the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,” said Martin McCrory, associate vice president
  for academic support and diversity, as well as vice provost for educational inclusion
  and diversity at IU Bloomington. “In choosing ‘A Call to All’ as this year’s theme,
  we wanted to make it clear that Dr. King’s message and call to action is everyone’s
  right and responsibility.”\nInformation and ways to become involved can be found
  on IU’s Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration website. Events and opportunities include:\nBuilding
  Bridges Award -- This is an opportunity to recognize an individual, group of people
  or organization that captures King's vision, spirit and leadership. Awards will
  be given to an undergraduate student; graduate/professional student or student instructor;
  a faculty member; a staff member; and a community member or organization. The deadline
  for nominations is Dec. 21. Winners will be announced at IU’s MLK Jr. Celebration
  Leadership Breakfast. Nominations can be made online.\n“A Day On, Not a Day Off”
  -- For the 2016 MLK Day, $39,500 was granted and more than 1,500 volunteers are
  needed to support service and educational projects by local groups and organizations.
  These include several affiliated with IU, like the Groups Scholars Program, Faculty
  and Staff for Student Excellence, the School of Education and many more. Learn more
  about volunteer opportunities online.\nCreate your own event -- In the spirit of
  King, grassroots activities celebrating his legacy are encouraged at IU. Past examples
  include movie nights, guest lectures and service projects hosted by residence halls,
  student groups and departments. Everyone is invited to submit and view events online.\nAbout
