- "\t\t\tThe success of last week's World Conference of Science Journalists augurs
  well for the future of the profession. But it needs to maintain its independence,
  and avoid becoming an extension of the public relations industry.\r\n"
- "Australia's science journalists have a hard act to follow. Last week — somewhat
  to their own surprise — their Canadian counterparts managed to attract a full house
  of 500 colleagues from across the world to Montréal for the 4th World Conference
  of Science Journalists. There they were exposed to three days of stimulating talks,
  debate and discussion about the state of their profession.\r\n"
- "At the end of the meeting, a decision was taken by representatives of national
  science writing associations that the next of these biannual meetings should be
  held in Melbourne, Australia, in 2006 (or perhaps early 2007). The choice was itself
  something of a surprise; a number of strong competing applications had been received,
  in particular from China and Italy. But the Australian delegation had come with
  a well-prepared bid stressing, among other aspects, the country's links with South-east
  Asia, a region in which science journalism remains relatively weak.\r\n"
- "For many of those attending the Montréal meeting, its most significant message
  was contained in the way that a series of speakers underlined the importance of
  their role as a channel of communication between scientists and society — and the
  challenges they face in carrying out this role effectively. Maureen O'Neill, for
  example, the president of Canada's International Development Research Centre (one
  of the main sponsors of the meeting) emphasised this point in her opening address,
  placing particular role on the need for this task within developing countries (See
  'Science journalists play critical role in decision-making').  \r\n"
- "For the experienced journalists present, the message was a familiar one. But for
  those relatively new to the profession, particularly those in many parts of the
  developing world struggling to establish their professional identity as science
  writers in a media world dominated by a reporting of politics and sport, the message
  provided welcome reassurance about the importance of their chosen path.\r\n"
- "External pressures\r\n"
- "Yet the meeting also provided several warnings about the narrowness of this path,
  and the pressures that can knock off balance those who seek to go down it. Many
  such pressures come from those with a vested interested in seeing their activities
  reported in a particular way. Sometimes such pressure is explicit and obvious. In
  other cases, the origins may be less clear (for example, when political pressure
  on a newspaper becomes transformed into an editorial judgement about news values
  imposed by senior editorial staff on junior reporters).\r\n"
- "Difficult as such pressures may be to resist, each can conflict with the responsibility
  of a journalist firstly to remain as faithful as possible to the facts, and secondly
  to use his or her best judgement of what is significant about such facts. Neither
  of these requires objectivity about the issue being described; the best journalists
  are those who can be passionate about the subjects that they cover. But they do
  demand that, however strong the passion, journalists retain a critical edge in their
  reporting that is sufficient to ensure the independence of their personal, informed
  judgement.\r\n"
- "Several warnings about ways in which this independence of judgement can be threatened
  were presented to the Montréal conference. One speaker, for example, warned journalists
  of the need for caution in reporting on the results of clinical trials of new pharmaceutical
  products, however well dressed up these may be in a cloak of scientific plausibility.
  For example, supporting papers from scientific journals may be provided with an
  inadequate interpretation of the data contained in such papers (See 'Journalists
  warn of helping drug giants 'market disease'').\r\n"
- "In another session, SciDev.Net's Beijing correspondent, Jia Hepeng, spoke of the
  difficulties facing journalists in China as the government seeks to control the
  distribution of information about sensitive topics such as the spread of the SARS
  virus. Criticism (much of it from outside China) about an initial lack of openness
  had helped to overcome the first hurdle faced by Chinese reporters, namely a sheer
  lack of information. But, said Jia, that had now been replaced by an equally daunting
  challenge, namely discovering the reality behind the facts and figures being presented
  in the name of an apparent transparency.\r\n"
- "In South Africa, a similar issue faces journalists who seek to report on the spread
  of HIV/AIDS. As Tamar Kahn, another SciDev.Net contributor, told the meeting, the
  task has become easier as a result of the government overcoming its previous reluctance
  to acknowledge the size of the AIDS problem it faces. But the tendency of government
  officials to play down the problem remains reflected in the difficulties faced by
  individual journalists in getting their stories accepted for publication. Kahn reports
  on her own difficulties in persuading her news editor to give a story about South
  Africa's AIDS epidemic reaching record proportions more than two short paragraphs
  on an inside page (see 'Controversy and science reporting in South Africa').\r\n"
- "The need for independence\r\n"
- "In such instances, it is usually relatively clear what the proper function of the
  science journalist should be. Equally important, however, is to retain the same
  independent stance when writing about science itself. There has been a tendency
  in recent years to assume that science journalists should, almost by definition,
  be part of the 'science promotion' business. This is particularly strong among those
  who argue that the low esteem in which science is widely held is primarily the results
  of a 'bad press' — and that science journalists have a responsibility to help reverse
  this situation.\r\n"
- "It is certainly true that what often distinguishes science journalists from their
  colleagues is greater knowledge of — and respect for — the way that science operates.
  Indeed one of the main reasons for promoting science journalism around the world
  is precisely to ensure that when science is written about, it is done in an informed
  manner.\r\n"
- "But that is not the same as endorsing everything that is said or done in the name
  of science (any more than an art critic is expected to endorse everything that is
  done in the name of art). In other words, science journalists should not be seen,
  or see themselves, as part of a public relations effort, however much those responsibility
  for promoting a particular scientific activity or programme seek to recruit them
  their cause.\r\n"
- "Blurring the line\r\n"
- "If there was a criticism to be made of the Montréal meeting, it was the extent
  to which some of those who had generously provided sponsorship to cover the travel
  and accommodation costs of foreign participants (particularly from developing countries)
  appeared to feel justified in subsequently using the conference as a promotional
  platform. In principle, of course, there is no reason that they should not do so;
  after all, no-one complains when the sponsor of a sporting event demands that a
  company logo be prominently featured in television coverage of that event.\r\n"
- "The danger lies in blurring the line between journalism and public relations. When
  that happens, a journalist is denying his or her responsibility to exercise a personal
  judgement of what is significant by substituting for it the judgement of others
  (who may have their own financial or political agenda). One response of the profession
  must lie in an insistence on editorial independence as a guarantor of journalistic
  integrity. A second lies in the need to ensure that a political commitment to the
  freedom of the press is adequately reflected in practice.\r\n"
- "Hopefully, the Australian organisers of the next world conference will bear the
  need to address these in mind when planning their programme. There certainly needs
  to be space on the programme to explore ways in which science journalists can ensure

  vehicle for creating a greater global awareness of Australia's scientific and technological
  achievements.\r\n"
- "Equally important, however, is that the meeting should address in detail some of
  the key challenges faced by science journalists around the world as they strive
  to create the conditions under which their profession can flourish. The Montréal
  meeting made a good start, and provided some important openings in this direction.
  The baton has now been passed to others to find ways of ensuring that this work
  is continued.\r\n"

- "\t    The success of last week's World Conference of Science Journalists augurs
  well for the future of the profession. But it needs to maintain its independence,
  and avoid becoming an extension of the public relations industry.Australia's science
  journalists have a hard act to follow. Last week — somewhat to their own surprise
  — their Canadian counterparts managed to attract a full house of 500 colleagues
  from across the world to Montréal for the 4th World Conference of Science Journalists.
  There they were exposed to three days of stimulating talks, debate and discussion
  about the state of their profession.At the end of the meeting, a decision was taken
  by representatives of national science writing associations that the next of these
  biannual meetings should be held in Melbourne, Australia, in 2006 (or perhaps early
  2007). The choice was itself something of a surprise; a number of strong competing
  applications had been received, in particular from China and Italy. But the Australian
  delegation had come with a well-prepared bid stressing, among other aspects, the
  country's links with South-east Asia, a region in which science journalism remains
  relatively weak.For many of those attending the Montréal meeting, its most significant
  message was contained in the way that a series of speakers underlined the importance
  of their role as a channel of communication between scientists and society — and
  the challenges they face in carrying out this role effectively. Maureen O'Neill,
  for example, the president of Canada's International Development Research Centre
  (one of the main sponsors of the meeting) emphasised this point in her opening address,
  placing particular role on the need for this task within developing countries (See
  'Science journalists play critical role in decision-making').  For the experienced
  journalists present, the message was a familiar one. But for those relatively new
  to the profession, particularly those in many parts of the developing world struggling
  to establish their professional identity as science writers in a media world dominated
  by a reporting of politics and sport, the message provided welcome reassurance about
  the importance of their chosen path.External pressuresYet the meeting also provided
  several warnings about the narrowness of this path, and the pressures that can knock
  off balance those who seek to go down it. Many such pressures come from those with
  a vested interested in seeing their activities reported in a particular way. Sometimes
  such pressure is explicit and obvious. In other cases, the origins may be less clear
  (for example, when political pressure on a newspaper becomes transformed into an
  editorial judgement about news values imposed by senior editorial staff on junior
  reporters).Difficult as such pressures may be to resist, each can conflict with
  the responsibility of a journalist firstly to remain as faithful as possible to
  the facts, and secondly to use his or her best judgement of what is significant
  about such facts. Neither of these requires objectivity about the issue being described;
  the best journalists are those who can be passionate about the subjects that they
  cover. But they do demand that, however strong the passion, journalists retain a
  critical edge in their reporting that is sufficient to ensure the independence of
  their personal, informed judgement.Several warnings about ways in which this independence
  of judgement can be threatened were presented to the Montréal conference. One speaker,
  for example, warned journalists of the need for caution in reporting on the results
  of clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products, however well dressed up these
  may be in a cloak of scientific plausibility. For example, supporting papers from
  scientific journals may be provided with an inadequate interpretation of the data
  contained in such papers (See 'Journalists warn of helping drug giants 'market disease'').In
  another session, SciDev.Net's Beijing correspondent, Jia Hepeng, spoke of the difficulties
  facing journalists in China as the government seeks to control the distribution
  of information about sensitive topics such as the spread of the SARS virus. Criticism
  (much of it from outside China) about an initial lack of openness had helped to
  overcome the first hurdle faced by Chinese reporters, namely a sheer lack of information.
  But, said Jia, that had now been replaced by an equally daunting challenge, namely
  discovering the reality behind the facts and figures being presented in the name
  of an apparent transparency.In South Africa, a similar issue faces journalists who
  seek to report on the spread of HIV/AIDS. As Tamar Kahn, another SciDev.Net contributor,
  told the meeting, the task has become easier as a result of the government overcoming
  its previous reluctance to acknowledge the size of the AIDS problem it faces. But
  the tendency of government officials to play down the problem remains reflected
  in the difficulties faced by individual journalists in getting their stories accepted
  for publication. Kahn reports on her own difficulties in persuading her news editor
  to give a story about South Africa's AIDS epidemic reaching record proportions more
  than two short paragraphs on an inside page (see 'Controversy and science reporting
  in South Africa').The need for independenceIn such instances, it is usually relatively
  clear what the proper function of the science journalist should be. Equally important,
  however, is to retain the same independent stance when writing about science itself.
  There has been a tendency in recent years to assume that science journalists should,
  almost by definition, be part of the 'science promotion' business. This is particularly
  strong among those who argue that the low esteem in which science is widely held
  is primarily the results of a 'bad press' — and that science journalists have a
  responsibility to help reverse this situation.It is certainly true that what often
  distinguishes science journalists from their colleagues is greater knowledge of
  — and respect for — the way that science operates. Indeed one of the main reasons
  for promoting science journalism around the world is precisely to ensure that when
  science is written about, it is done in an informed manner.But that is not the same
  as endorsing everything that is said or done in the name of science (any more than
  an art critic is expected to endorse everything that is done in the name of art).
  In other words, science journalists should not be seen, or see themselves, as part
  of a public relations effort, however much those responsibility for promoting a
  particular scientific activity or programme seek to recruit them their cause.Blurring
  the lineIf there was a criticism to be made of the Montréal meeting, it was the
  extent to which some of those who had generously provided sponsorship to cover the
  travel and accommodation costs of foreign participants (particularly from developing
  countries) appeared to feel justified in subsequently using the conference as a
  promotional platform. In principle, of course, there is no reason that they should
  not do so; after all, no-one complains when the sponsor of a sporting event demands
  that a company logo be prominently featured in television coverage of that event.The
  danger lies in blurring the line between journalism and public relations. When that
  happens, a journalist is denying his or her responsibility to exercise a personal
  judgement of what is significant by substituting for it the judgement of others
  (who may have their own financial or political agenda). One response of the profession
  must lie in an insistence on editorial independence as a guarantor of journalistic
  integrity. A second lies in the need to ensure that a political commitment to the
  freedom of the press is adequately reflected in practice.Hopefully, the Australian
  organisers of the next world conference will bear the need to address these in mind
  when planning their programme. There certainly needs to be space on the programme
  to explore ways in which science journalists can ensure that the media adequately
  acknowledges and reflects the role of science in modern societies, both developed
  and developing. And the meeting will obviously be a useful vehicle for creating
  a greater global awareness of Australia's scientific and technological achievements.Equally
  important, however, is that the meeting should address in detail some of the key
  challenges faced by science journalists around the world as they strive to create
  the conditions under which their profession can flourish. The Montréal meeting made
  a good start, and provided some important openings in this direction. The baton
  has now been passed to others to find ways of ensuring that this work is continued.Related

  \   Science journalism must keep a critical edge\r\n\t    \tDavid Dickson\r\n\t
  \   \r\n\t\t    \t11 October 2004 |\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEN\r\n\t    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tThe
  success of last week's World Conference of Science Journalists augurs well for the
  future of the profession. But it needs to maintain its independence, and avoid becoming
  an extension of the public relations industry.\r\nAustralia's science journalists
  have a hard act to follow. Last week — somewhat to their own surprise — their Canadian
  counterparts managed to attract a full house of 500 colleagues from across the world
  to Montréal for the 4th World Conference of Science Journalists. There they were
  exposed to three days of stimulating talks, debate and discussion about the state
  of their profession.\r\nAt the end of the meeting, a decision was taken by representatives
  of national science writing associations that the next of these biannual meetings
  should be held in Melbourne, Australia, in 2006 (or perhaps early 2007). The choice
  was itself something of a surprise; a number of strong competing applications had
  been received, in particular from China and Italy. But the Australian delegation
  had come with a well-prepared bid stressing, among other aspects, the country's
  links with South-east Asia, a region in which science journalism remains relatively
  weak.\r\nFor many of those attending the Montréal meeting, its most significant
  message was contained in the way that a series of speakers underlined the importance
  of their role as a channel of communication between scientists and society — and
  the challenges they face in carrying out this role effectively. Maureen O'Neill,
  for example, the president of Canada's International Development Research Centre
  (one of the main sponsors of the meeting) emphasised this point in her opening address,
  placing particular role on the need for this task within developing countries (See
  'Science journalists play critical role in decision-making').  \r\nFor the experienced
  journalists present, the message was a familiar one. But for those relatively new
  to the profession, particularly those in many parts of the developing world struggling
  to establish their professional identity as science writers in a media world dominated
  by a reporting of politics and sport, the message provided welcome reassurance about
  the importance of their chosen path.\r\nExternal pressures\r\nYet the meeting also
  provided several warnings about the narrowness of this path, and the pressures that
  can knock off balance those who seek to go down it. Many such pressures come from
  those with a vested interested in seeing their activities reported in a particular
  way. Sometimes such pressure is explicit and obvious. In other cases, the origins
  may be less clear (for example, when political pressure on a newspaper becomes transformed
  into an editorial judgement about news values imposed by senior editorial staff
  on junior reporters).\r\nDifficult as such pressures may be to resist, each can
  conflict with the responsibility of a journalist firstly to remain as faithful as
  possible to the facts, and secondly to use his or her best judgement of what is
  significant about such facts. Neither of these requires objectivity about the issue
  being described; the best journalists are those who can be passionate about the
  subjects that they cover. But they do demand that, however strong the passion, journalists
  retain a critical edge in their reporting that is sufficient to ensure the independence
  of their personal, informed judgement.\r\nSeveral warnings about ways in which this
  independence of judgement can be threatened were presented to the Montréal conference.
  One speaker, for example, warned journalists of the need for caution in reporting
  on the results of clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products, however well dressed
  up these may be in a cloak of scientific plausibility. For example, supporting papers
  from scientific journals may be provided with an inadequate interpretation of the
  data contained in such papers (See 'Journalists warn of helping drug giants 'market
  disease'').\r\nIn another session, SciDev.Net's Beijing correspondent, Jia Hepeng,
  spoke of the difficulties facing journalists in China as the government seeks to
  control the distribution of information about sensitive topics such as the spread
  of the SARS virus. Criticism (much of it from outside China) about an initial lack
  of openness had helped to overcome the first hurdle faced by Chinese reporters,
  namely a sheer lack of information. But, said Jia, that had now been replaced by
  an equally daunting challenge, namely discovering the reality behind the facts and
  figures being presented in the name of an apparent transparency.\r\nIn South Africa,
  a similar issue faces journalists who seek to report on the spread of HIV/AIDS.
  As Tamar Kahn, another SciDev.Net contributor, told the meeting, the task has become
  easier as a result of the government overcoming its previous reluctance to acknowledge
  the size of the AIDS problem it faces. But the tendency of government officials
  to play down the problem remains reflected in the difficulties faced by individual
  journalists in getting their stories accepted for publication. Kahn reports on her
  own difficulties in persuading her news editor to give a story about South Africa's
  AIDS epidemic reaching record proportions more than two short paragraphs on an inside
  page (see 'Controversy and science reporting in South Africa').\r\nThe need for
  independence\r\nIn such instances, it is usually relatively clear what the proper
  function of the science journalist should be. Equally important, however, is to
  retain the same independent stance when writing about science itself. There has
  been a tendency in recent years to assume that science journalists should, almost
  by definition, be part of the 'science promotion' business. This is particularly
  strong among those who argue that the low esteem in which science is widely held
  is primarily the results of a 'bad press' — and that science journalists have a
  responsibility to help reverse this situation.\r\nIt is certainly true that what
  often distinguishes science journalists from their colleagues is greater knowledge
  of — and respect for — the way that science operates. Indeed one of the main reasons
  for promoting science journalism around the world is precisely to ensure that when
  science is written about, it is done in an informed manner.\r\nBut that is not the
  same as endorsing everything that is said or done in the name of science (any more
  than an art critic is expected to endorse everything that is done in the name of
  art). In other words, science journalists should not be seen, or see themselves,
  as part of a public relations effort, however much those responsibility for promoting
  a particular scientific activity or programme seek to recruit them their cause.\r\nBlurring
  the line\r\nIf there was a criticism to be made of the Montréal meeting, it was
  the extent to which some of those who had generously provided sponsorship to cover
  the travel and accommodation costs of foreign participants (particularly from developing
  countries) appeared to feel justified in subsequently using the conference as a
  promotional platform. In principle, of course, there is no reason that they should
  not do so; after all, no-one complains when the sponsor of a sporting event demands
  that a company logo be prominently featured in television coverage of that event.\r\nThe
  danger lies in blurring the line between journalism and public relations. When that
  happens, a journalist is denying his or her responsibility to exercise a personal
  judgement of what is significant by substituting for it the judgement of others
  (who may have their own financial or political agenda). One response of the profession
  must lie in an insistence on editorial independence as a guarantor of journalistic
  integrity. A second lies in the need to ensure that a political commitment to the
  freedom of the press is adequately reflected in practice.\r\nHopefully, the Australian
  organisers of the next world conference will bear the need to address these in mind
  when planning their programme. There certainly needs to be space on the programme
  to explore ways in which science journalists can ensure that the media adequately
  acknowledges and reflects the role of science in modern societies, both developed
  and developing. And the meeting will obviously be a useful vehicle for creating
  a greater global awareness of Australia's scientific and technological achievements.\r\nEqually
  important, however, is that the meeting should address in detail some of the key
  challenges faced by science journalists around the world as they strive to create
  the conditions under which their profession can flourish. The Montréal meeting made
  a good start, and provided some important openings in this direction. The baton
  has now been passed to others to find ways of ensuring that this work is continued.\r\nRelated

  \   \t11 October 2004 |\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEN\r\n\t    The success of last week's
  World Conference of Science Journalists augurs well for the future of the profession.
  But it needs to maintain its independence, and avoid becoming an extension of the
  public relations industry.Australia's science journalists have a hard act to follow.
  Last week — somewhat to their own surprise — their Canadian counterparts managed
  to attract a full house of 500 colleagues from across the world to Montréal for
  the 4th World Conference of Science Journalists. There they were exposed to three
  days of stimulating talks, debate and discussion about the state of their profession.At
  the end of the meeting, a decision was taken by representatives of national science
  writing associations that the next of these biannual meetings should be held in
  Melbourne, Australia, in 2006 (or perhaps early 2007). The choice was itself something
  of a surprise; a number of strong competing applications had been received, in particular
  from China and Italy. But the Australian delegation had come with a well-prepared
  bid stressing, among other aspects, the country's links with South-east Asia, a
  region in which science journalism remains relatively weak.For many of those attending
  the Montréal meeting, its most significant message was contained in the way that
  a series of speakers underlined the importance of their role as a channel of communication
  between scientists and society — and the challenges they face in carrying out this
  role effectively. Maureen O'Neill, for example, the president of Canada's International
  Development Research Centre (one of the main sponsors of the meeting) emphasised
  this point in her opening address, placing particular role on the need for this
  task within developing countries (See 'Science journalists play critical role in
  decision-making').  For the experienced journalists present, the message was a familiar
  one. But for those relatively new to the profession, particularly those in many
  parts of the developing world struggling to establish their professional identity
  as science writers in a media world dominated by a reporting of politics and sport,
  the message provided welcome reassurance about the importance of their chosen path.External
  pressuresYet the meeting also provided several warnings about the narrowness of
  this path, and the pressures that can knock off balance those who seek to go down
  it. Many such pressures come from those with a vested interested in seeing their
  activities reported in a particular way. Sometimes such pressure is explicit and
  obvious. In other cases, the origins may be less clear (for example, when political
  pressure on a newspaper becomes transformed into an editorial judgement about news
  values imposed by senior editorial staff on junior reporters).Difficult as such
  pressures may be to resist, each can conflict with the responsibility of a journalist
  firstly to remain as faithful as possible to the facts, and secondly to use his
  or her best judgement of what is significant about such facts. Neither of these
  requires objectivity about the issue being described; the best journalists are those
  who can be passionate about the subjects that they cover. But they do demand that,
  however strong the passion, journalists retain a critical edge in their reporting
  that is sufficient to ensure the independence of their personal, informed judgement.Several
  warnings about ways in which this independence of judgement can be threatened were
  presented to the Montréal conference. One speaker, for example, warned journalists
  of the need for caution in reporting on the results of clinical trials of new pharmaceutical
  products, however well dressed up these may be in a cloak of scientific plausibility.
  For example, supporting papers from scientific journals may be provided with an
  inadequate interpretation of the data contained in such papers (See 'Journalists
  warn of helping drug giants 'market disease'').In another session, SciDev.Net's
  Beijing correspondent, Jia Hepeng, spoke of the difficulties facing journalists
  in China as the government seeks to control the distribution of information about
  sensitive topics such as the spread of the SARS virus. Criticism (much of it from
  outside China) about an initial lack of openness had helped to overcome the first
  hurdle faced by Chinese reporters, namely a sheer lack of information. But, said
  Jia, that had now been replaced by an equally daunting challenge, namely discovering
  the reality behind the facts and figures being presented in the name of an apparent
  transparency.In South Africa, a similar issue faces journalists who seek to report
  on the spread of HIV/AIDS. As Tamar Kahn, another SciDev.Net contributor, told the
  meeting, the task has become easier as a result of the government overcoming its
  previous reluctance to acknowledge the size of the AIDS problem it faces. But the
  tendency of government officials to play down the problem remains reflected in the
  difficulties faced by individual journalists in getting their stories accepted for
  publication. Kahn reports on her own difficulties in persuading her news editor
  to give a story about South Africa's AIDS epidemic reaching record proportions more
  than two short paragraphs on an inside page (see 'Controversy and science reporting
  in South Africa').The need for independenceIn such instances, it is usually relatively
  clear what the proper function of the science journalist should be. Equally important,
  however, is to retain the same independent stance when writing about science itself.
  There has been a tendency in recent years to assume that science journalists should,
  almost by definition, be part of the 'science promotion' business. This is particularly
  strong among those who argue that the low esteem in which science is widely held
  is primarily the results of a 'bad press' — and that science journalists have a
  responsibility to help reverse this situation.It is certainly true that what often
  distinguishes science journalists from their colleagues is greater knowledge of
  — and respect for — the way that science operates. Indeed one of the main reasons
  for promoting science journalism around the world is precisely to ensure that when
  science is written about, it is done in an informed manner.But that is not the same
  as endorsing everything that is said or done in the name of science (any more than
  an art critic is expected to endorse everything that is done in the name of art).
  In other words, science journalists should not be seen, or see themselves, as part
  of a public relations effort, however much those responsibility for promoting a
  particular scientific activity or programme seek to recruit them their cause.Blurring
  the lineIf there was a criticism to be made of the Montréal meeting, it was the
  extent to which some of those who had generously provided sponsorship to cover the
  travel and accommodation costs of foreign participants (particularly from developing
  countries) appeared to feel justified in subsequently using the conference as a
  promotional platform. In principle, of course, there is no reason that they should
  not do so; after all, no-one complains when the sponsor of a sporting event demands
  that a company logo be prominently featured in television coverage of that event.The
  danger lies in blurring the line between journalism and public relations. When that
  happens, a journalist is denying his or her responsibility to exercise a personal
  judgement of what is significant by substituting for it the judgement of others
  (who may have their own financial or political agenda). One response of the profession
  must lie in an insistence on editorial independence as a guarantor of journalistic
  integrity. A second lies in the need to ensure that a political commitment to the
  freedom of the press is adequately reflected in practice.Hopefully, the Australian
  organisers of the next world conference will bear the need to address these in mind
  when planning their programme. There certainly needs to be space on the programme
  to explore ways in which science journalists can ensure that the media adequately
  acknowledges and reflects the role of science in modern societies, both developed
  and developing. And the meeting will obviously be a useful vehicle for creating
  a greater global awareness of Australia's scientific and technological achievements.Equally
  important, however, is that the meeting should address in detail some of the key
  challenges faced by science journalists around the world as they strive to create
  the conditions under which their profession can flourish. The Montréal meeting made
  a good start, and provided some important openings in this direction. The baton
  has now been passed to others to find ways of ensuring that this work is continued.Related
