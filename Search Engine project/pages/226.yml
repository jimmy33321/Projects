  She was voted to Forbes’ 30 under 30, is blazingly smart, and will tackle any challenge that comes her way…but talking to her, you’ll notice a humble human being (and get distracted by her wonderfully curly hair and sarcastic wit).

- |
  What is your idea of perfect happiness?
- |
  Traveling somewhere I’ve never been with people I really love.
- |
   
- |
  What is your greatest fear?
- |
  Inertia, stagnation, an unexamined life.
- |
   
- |
  What is your greatest extravagance?
- |
  It’s-its.
- |
   
- |
  What is your most marked characteristic?
- |
  I’m pretty earnest, though sometimes people can’t tell if I’m being super earnest or super sarcastic. And I have really curly hair, which is useful for finding me in a crowd.
- |
   
- |
  What do you most value in your friends?
- |
  On Wednesdays we wear pink.
- |
   
- |
  What is your motto?
- |
  I’m not sure if this is really a motto, but I think this E.B. White quote captures me pretty well: “I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.”

  This week’s KA spotlight is on… James Irwin!
- |
  James joined us in 2011 and helped build the first version of our internal content management tools—these days, you’ll find him taking care of our international sites (Spanish, Portuguese, French, and more) to help make sure that the 5+ billion people in the world who don’t speak English can get a free education too.
- |
  Which historical figure do you most identify with?Richard Feynman. I read Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman, and What Do You Care What Other People Think when I was a teenager and I was greatly impressed not just by his intelligence but his basic attitude toward life.
- |
  What is your greatest extravagance?All the travel I’ve done.
- |
  What is your favorite journey?This one is tough. Backpacking in Patagonia, epic bus trip from Arusha to Victoria Falls, many various parts of my 6 month honeymoon before starting at KA (Siem Reap, Kilimanjaro, backpacking between villages in Turkey), Outward Bounds I took as a teenager all come to mind, the trip I took when I was 20 where I ended up staying at a Buddhist monastery in Thailand (and smuggling in some beer for one of the monks), and then doing a week long hike in Nepal. For now I’ll go with a solo trip that I took from the school I taught at in Tanzania to where my sister was staying on the shores of Lake Malawi. It involved a bus trip to the border, sitting on the back of a bike as a guy pedaled the three miles to the border, a minibus up the steep slopes of the mountains on the northern section of Lake Malawi, and sitting in the back of a pickup truck on top of a bunch of sack of rice through the heartland. I don’t think I ever felt as free as then.
- |
  When and where were you happiest?My second wedding celebration with Lucie (we had 3!) We had rented out small eccentric mountain hotel in Austria where we resaid our vows under a chandelier outdoors hanging from a tree in front of a small group of our friends and family. We stayed the entire weekend there in the place decorated with such things as a lifesize paper-mache astronaut, a gigantic yellow ox, fake chicken feet on the ceiling, and a rickshaw, and a picture of the last supper where all the apostles were mostly naked gay men.
- |
  If you could change one thing about your family, what would it be?When I wanted them closer they would be. My in-laws are in Germany, my one sister and my two nieces are in Vienna, and my other sister, my mom, and my three nephews are in Budapest. This I normally consider to be a safe healthy distance, but at other times I wish they were closer and I could just pop on over to see them.
- |
  What is your favorite occupation?My current one, though sometimes I fantasize about being a forest ranger, where I can be outdoors all day in the Sierras doing physical labor.

  This week’s KA spotlight is on… Kitt Hirasaki!
- |2+

- |
  This week’s spotlight is on one of our designers, Kitt, who has worked on building out Khan Academy’s community features and getting teachers the info they need about their students. Kitt is currently working on building free, world-class test prep for the new SAT. In the afternoons, you might find him hosting a chocolate and beer tasting or improv session for the office, but on game nights you’ll often find him playing a mean game of Coup, poker, or Bang! (pictured).

  Where are you using your growth mindset?I’m always working to help my daughters develop growth mindsets, encouraging them to practice and persist. It’s come easily for one daughter and not the other, but I’m using a meta growth mindset about promoting her growth mindset. I’m also using a growth mindset to push myself to be the best father I can, pushing myself to find patience when I feel frustration, and setting aside what I want for my children so I can support them for what they need instead.
- |
  I’m also using a growth mindset to continuously improve my design skills. I used it last weekend to start to overcome my past failures with hula-hooping, and I’m using it to improve my first-person-shooter player-vs-player skills, where my kill:killed ratio is currently about 1:10.
- |
  What are your favorite names?When my wife was pregnant with our first child, we each made lists of names for the baby. “Adelaide” was the one that appeared on both my wife’s and my lists. A bit of insight into what I wanted to project onto my child, but I also had the names Cordelia, Beatrix, and Maeve on my list. For a boy, we could only agree on one name, and it’s pretty unusual: Tasman. Nickname “Taz.” (My wife’s an Australia-phile.) Feel free to use them for your children!

  This week’s KA spotlight is on… Rishi Desai!
- |
  Rishi works connecting people to quality information about health and medicine. In addition to his work at Khan Academy on creating medical content, he is currently a pediatric infectious disease physician and previously spent two years at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). If you’re ever interested in venturing more into the medical world, check out our health and medicine content to see some of Rishi’s work for yourself.
- |
  What is your greatest fear?Raccoons! The fear started when I was living in SF about 10 years ago and I would occasionally come across a pack of them while taking out the trash. They’re clever, roam in packs, aggressive, and carry diseases (look up Baylisascaris!). [Editor’s note: do not do this. Or at least don’t Google Image Search it like I did.] My Room 101 would be loaded with these freaky little bandits!
- |
  Which talent would you most like to have?If I could have any talent it would be to play a sport really well - either badminton or basketball. I love them both and it would be awesome to play at a really high level.
- |
  Where would you like to live?I would love to live in a treehouse, with friends/family living in nearby trees. We would all work from home and spend our free time exploring the forest together. There is a bit of monkey-envy woven into this dream.
- |
  Which living person do you most admire?I really admire Jon Stewart. I think that he’s a brilliant interviewer/educator/comedian, with an incredible understanding of world issues/politics. It would be a dream to meet him some day.
- |
  If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?I hope to become more mindful over time. I often catch myself thinking about the past or the future, and losing sight of “now”. I think that’s why I love being a pediatrician. Kids are really great at being present. =)

  Dylan first started as an intern at Khan Academy in summer 2012, when we were just a couple dozen folks squishing into an older office space in downtown Mountain View. From his California upbringing and UCLA education, he brought a sunny, laidback demeanor with the ability to deliver. We were so happy when he decided to return fulltime, and he continues to bring that level of enthusiasm with him always. He always is excited to tackle the next project and join in the latest social event. From my biased international perspective, I am particularly excited that it was Dylan who first made Khan Academy international pages available, as the last part of his internship - to which we like to tease that he literally brought free education to the world. And this summer, continued this work on the infrastructure for our localized sites like Spanish, Portuguese, and French.  This is only the tip of the iceberg of what makes Dylan so great.  Check out his Khanversation below for more!

  Dylan gets his game on for the annual KIPP Bay Area charter school ping pong tournamentWhat is your favorite journey?
- |
  I have two, deal with it. One is taking 280 North (definitely not 101) from Mountain View up to Santa Rosa, where my family lives. Speeding Driving up 280 on a sunny Saturday morning with the windows down and music blasting always feels so good. My other favorite journey is driving down to LA—not because I love the smell of cow poop in the afternoon, but because it means that I’m about to relive the best parts of college with friends I haven’t seen in a while. I get a lot of thinking done on that drive, too. The last time I made that trip, though, I had the brilliant idea to try driving back up to Mountain View without stopping at all. I don’t recommend it; 6-ish hours later I pulled into the Chevron on Shoreline with a dangerously empty gas tank and stomach and a dangerously full bladder. But I was so proud of myself.

  What is your greatest extravagance?
- |
  I love live music and try to catch it every chance I get. This spring and summer I made it to three festivals, a stadium tour, and a couple of other shows. I can’t get hearing damage until I’m 26 and married*, right?
- |
  When and where were you happiest?
- |
  I wouldn’t say this makes me the absolute happiest I could possibly ever be, but watching just one episode—literally any episode—of 30 Rock will turn around the foulest of moods for me. That sounds trite, but nothing else does the trick as reliably as 30 Rock (although Portlandia is a runner-up). It’s like a magic happiness pill that takes effect in 25 minutes.
- |
  What do you most value in your friends?
- |
  My best friends don’t take themselves too seriously. I’m not always great at this, but I’ve learned that if you can’t laugh at yourself then you’re making life a lot harder than it has to be.
- |
  What is your motto?
- |
  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle said, “Life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent.” That idea has been proven to me over and over again and is the only assumption I can safely make about the world. My love of people-watching is probably related to this.

  *“26 and married”: An intern once quipped that she wanted to hang out with people who were similar to her, not like those of us who were “26 and married”.  At the time, one person in the organization met the criteria. We refer to “26 and married” as the point in life beyond which the young think we cease to be cool.

  Historical Facebook post commemorating the new conference room names:
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  When we moved offices and got a few more conference rooms, we added a few more names “Style”, “Ventive”, “Credible”, “Love, "Diana Jones”, “Trouble”…you get the point.  Usually, we matched the type of room with the name. For example, “Sync’ was the kitchen (in the new office, it’s "Digestion”), “Cognito” was a tiny windowless room that we used as a phone booth. “Trouble” is Sal’s office, etc.

  This week’s KA spotlight is on…Zach Gotsch!
- |
  Zach believes that when everyone is educated, a lot of the world’s problems are much easier to fix, so that’s one of the driving reasons he ended up as a code wizard with our motley crew at KA. In his free time, he can be found West Coast Swing dancing, climbing rocks and reading books.

  to Forbes’ 30 under 30, is blazingly smart, and will tackle any challenge that comes

  by her wonderfully curly hair and sarcastic wit). What is your idea of perfect happiness?Traveling
  somewhere I’ve never been with people I really love. What is your greatest fear?Inertia,
  stagnation, an unexamined life. What is your greatest extravagance?It’s-its. What
  is your most marked characteristic?I’m pretty earnest, though sometimes people can’t
  tell if I’m being super earnest or super sarcastic. And I have really curly hair,
  which is useful for finding me in a crowd. What do you most value in your friends?On
  Wednesdays we wear pink. What is your motto?I’m not sure if this is really a motto,
  but I think this E.B. White quote captures me pretty well: “I arise in the morning
  torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world. This
  makes it hard to plan the day.”Tags:Tweet \n"

  What Do You Care What Other People Think when I was a teenager and I was greatly
  impressed not just by his intelligence but his basic attitude toward life.What is
  your greatest extravagance?All the travel I’ve done.What is your favorite journey?This
  one is tough. Backpacking in Patagonia, epic bus trip from Arusha to Victoria Falls,
  many various parts of my 6 month honeymoon before starting at KA (Siem Reap, Kilimanjaro,
  backpacking between villages in Turkey), Outward Bounds I took as a teenager all
  come to mind, the trip I took when I was 20 where I ended up staying at a Buddhist
  monastery in Thailand (and smuggling in some beer for one of the monks), and then
  doing a week long hike in Nepal. For now I’ll go with a solo trip that I took from
  the school I taught at in Tanzania to where my sister was staying on the shores
  of Lake Malawi. It involved a bus trip to the border, sitting on the back of a bike
  as a guy pedaled the three miles to the border, a minibus up the steep slopes of
  the mountains on the northern section of Lake Malawi, and sitting in the back of
  a pickup truck on top of a bunch of sack of rice through the heartland. I don’t
  think I ever felt as free as then.When and where were you happiest?My second wedding
  celebration with Lucie (we had 3!) We had rented out small eccentric mountain hotel
  in Austria where we resaid our vows under a chandelier outdoors hanging from a tree
  in front of a small group of our friends and family. We stayed the entire weekend
  there in the place decorated with such things as a lifesize paper-mache astronaut,
  a gigantic yellow ox, fake chicken feet on the ceiling, and a rickshaw, and a picture
  of the last supper where all the apostles were mostly naked gay men.If you could
  change one thing about your family, what would it be?When I wanted them closer they
  would be. My in-laws are in Germany, my one sister and my two nieces are in Vienna,
  and my other sister, my mom, and my three nephews are in Budapest. This I normally
  consider to be a safe healthy distance, but at other times I wish they were closer
  and I could just pop on over to see them.What is your favorite occupation?My current
  one, though sometimes I fantasize about being a forest ranger, where I can be outdoors
  all day in the Sierras doing physical labor.Tweet \n"

  is on one of our designers, Kitt, who has worked on building out Khan Academy’s
  community features and getting teachers the info they need about their students.
  Kitt is currently working on building free, world-class test prep for the new SAT.
  In the afternoons, you might find him hosting a chocolate and beer tasting or improv
  session for the office, but on game nights you’ll often find him playing a mean
  game of Coup, poker, or Bang! (pictured).Where are you using your growth mindset?I’m
  always working to help my daughters develop growth mindsets, encouraging them to
  practice and persist. It’s come easily for one daughter and not the other, but I’m
  using a meta growth mindset about promoting her growth mindset. I’m also using a
  growth mindset to push myself to be the best father I can, pushing myself to find
  patience when I feel frustration, and setting aside what I want for my children
  so I can support them for what they need instead.I’m also using a growth mindset
  to continuously improve my design skills. I used it last weekend to start to overcome
  my past failures with hula-hooping, and I’m using it to improve my first-person-shooter
  player-vs-player skills, where my kill:killed ratio is currently about 1:10.What
  are your favorite names?When my wife was pregnant with our first child, we each
  made lists of names for the baby. “Adelaide” was the one that appeared on both my
  wife’s and my lists. A bit of insight into what I wanted to project onto my child,
  but I also had the names Cordelia, Beatrix, and Maeve on my list. For a boy, we
  could only agree on one name, and it’s pretty unusual: Tasman. Nickname “Taz.” (My
  wife’s an Australia-phile.) Feel free to use them for your children!Interview by
  Kate Mason.Tweet \n"

  people to quality information about health and medicine. In addition to his work
  at Khan Academy on creating medical content, he is currently a pediatric infectious
  disease physician and previously spent two years at the Centers for Disease Control
  and Prevention (CDC). If you’re ever interested in venturing more into the medical
  world, check out our health and medicine content to see some of Rishi’s work for
  yourself.What is your greatest fear?Raccoons! The fear started when I was living
  in SF about 10 years ago and I would occasionally come across a pack of them while
  taking out the trash. They’re clever, roam in packs, aggressive, and carry diseases
  (look up Baylisascaris!). [Editor’s note: do not do this. Or at least don’t Google
  Image Search it like I did.] My Room 101 would be loaded with these freaky little
  bandits!Which talent would you most like to have?If I could have any talent it would
  be to play a sport really well - either badminton or basketball. I love them both
  and it would be awesome to play at a really high level.Where would you like to live?I
  would love to live in a treehouse, with friends/family living in nearby trees. We
  would all work from home and spend our free time exploring the forest together.
  There is a bit of monkey-envy woven into this dream.Which living person do you most
  admire?I really admire Jon Stewart. I think that he’s a brilliant interviewer/educator/comedian,
  with an incredible understanding of world issues/politics. It would be a dream to
  meet him some day.If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?I
  hope to become more mindful over time. I often catch myself thinking about the past
  or the future, and losing sight of “now”. I think that’s why I love being a pediatrician.
  Kids are really great at being present. =)Interview by Kate Mason.Tweet \n"

- "\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat is your favorite journey?I have two, deal with it. One is taking
  280 North (definitely not 101) from Mountain View up to Santa Rosa, where my family
  lives. Speeding Driving up 280 on a sunny Saturday morning with the windows down
  and music blasting always feels so good. My other favorite journey is driving down
  to LA—not because I love the smell of cow poop in the afternoon, but because it
  means that I’m about to relive the best parts of college with friends I haven’t
  seen in a while. I get a lot of thinking done on that drive, too. The last time
  I made that trip, though, I had the brilliant idea to try driving back up to Mountain
  View without stopping at all. I don’t recommend it; 6-ish hours later I pulled into
  the Chevron on Shoreline with a dangerously empty gas tank and stomach and a dangerously
  full bladder. But I was so proud of myself.What is your greatest extravagance?I
  love live music and try to catch it every chance I get. This spring and summer I
  made it to three festivals, a stadium tour, and a couple of other shows. I can’t
  get hearing damage until I’m 26 and married*, right?When and where were you happiest?I
  wouldn’t say this makes me the absolute happiest I could possibly ever be, but watching
  just one episode—literally any episode—of 30 Rock will turn around the foulest of
  moods for me. That sounds trite, but nothing else does the trick as reliably as
  30 Rock (although Portlandia is a runner-up). It’s like a magic happiness pill that
  takes effect in 25 minutes.What do you most value in your friends?My best friends
  don’t take themselves too seriously. I’m not always great at this, but I’ve learned
  that if you can’t laugh at yourself then you’re making life a lot harder than it
  has to be.What is your motto?Sir Arthur Conan Doyle said, “Life is infinitely stranger
  than anything which the mind of man could invent.” That idea has been proven to
  me over and over again and is the only assumption I can safely make about the world.
  My love of people-watching is probably related to this.*“26 and married”: An intern
  once quipped that she wanted to hang out with people who were similar to her, not
  like those of us who were “26 and married”.  At the time, one person in the organization
  met the criteria. We refer to “26 and married” as the point in life beyond which
  the young think we cease to be cool.  Tags:Tweet \n"

- "\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA couple years ago, we named our conference rooms so that we could
  say “let’s meet in _______” with amusing consequences. We found it entertaining,
  and over the years, it has continued for our visitors and growing team. Historical
  Facebook post commemorating the new conference room names:When we moved offices
  and got a few more conference rooms, we added a few more names “Style”, “Ventive”,
  “Credible”, “Love, \"Diana Jones”, “Trouble”…you get the point.  Usually, we matched
  the type of room with the name. For example, “Sync’ was the kitchen (in the new
  office, it’s \"Digestion”), “Cognito” was a tiny windowless room that we used as
  a phone booth. “Trouble” is Sal’s office, etc.  Today, in this spirit, an unnamed
  individual added the latest to this line-up.Tags:Tweet \n"

  week’s KA spotlight is on….Elizabeth Slavitt!  \nShe was voted to Forbes’ 30 under
  30, is blazingly smart, and will tackle any challenge that comes her way…but talking
  to her, you’ll notice a humble human being (and get distracted by her wonderfully
  curly hair and sarcastic wit). \n\n\n\nWhat is your idea of perfect happiness?\nTraveling
  somewhere I’ve never been with people I really love.\n \nWhat is your greatest fear?\nInertia,
  stagnation, an unexamined life.\n \nWhat is your greatest extravagance?\nIt’s-its.\n \nWhat
  is your most marked characteristic?\nI’m pretty earnest, though sometimes people
  can’t tell if I’m being super earnest or super sarcastic. And I have really curly
  hair, which is useful for finding me in a crowd.\n \nWhat do you most value in your
  friends?\nOn Wednesdays we wear pink.\n \nWhat is your motto?\nI’m not sure if this
  is really a motto, but I think this E.B. White quote captures me pretty well: “I
  arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to
  enjoy the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t

  Khanversation with… software developer James Irwin!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nThis
  week’s KA spotlight is on… James Irwin!\nJames joined us in 2011 and helped build
  the first version of our internal content management tools—these days, you’ll find
  him taking care of our international sites (Spanish, Portuguese, French, and more)
  to help make sure that the 5+ billion people in the world who don’t speak English
  can get a free education too.\nWhich historical figure do you most identify with?Richard
  Feynman. I read Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman, and What Do You Care What Other
  People Think when I was a teenager and I was greatly impressed not just by his intelligence
  but his basic attitude toward life.\nWhat is your greatest extravagance?All the
  travel I’ve done.\nWhat is your favorite journey?This one is tough. Backpacking
  in Patagonia, epic bus trip from Arusha to Victoria Falls, many various parts of
  my 6 month honeymoon before starting at KA (Siem Reap, Kilimanjaro, backpacking
  between villages in Turkey), Outward Bounds I took as a teenager all come to mind,
  the trip I took when I was 20 where I ended up staying at a Buddhist monastery in
  Thailand (and smuggling in some beer for one of the monks), and then doing a week
  long hike in Nepal. For now I’ll go with a solo trip that I took from the school
  I taught at in Tanzania to where my sister was staying on the shores of Lake Malawi.
  It involved a bus trip to the border, sitting on the back of a bike as a guy pedaled
  the three miles to the border, a minibus up the steep slopes of the mountains on
  the northern section of Lake Malawi, and sitting in the back of a pickup truck on
  top of a bunch of sack of rice through the heartland. I don’t think I ever felt
  as free as then.\nWhen and where were you happiest?My second wedding celebration
  with Lucie (we had 3!) We had rented out small eccentric mountain hotel in Austria
  where we resaid our vows under a chandelier outdoors hanging from a tree in front
  of a small group of our friends and family. We stayed the entire weekend there in
  the place decorated with such things as a lifesize paper-mache astronaut, a gigantic
  yellow ox, fake chicken feet on the ceiling, and a rickshaw, and a picture of the
  last supper where all the apostles were mostly naked gay men.\nIf you could change
  one thing about your family, what would it be?When I wanted them closer they would
  be. My in-laws are in Germany, my one sister and my two nieces are in Vienna, and
  my other sister, my mom, and my three nephews are in Budapest. This I normally consider
  to be a safe healthy distance, but at other times I wish they were closer and I
  could just pop on over to see them.\nWhat is your favorite occupation?My current
  one, though sometimes I fantasize about being a forest ranger, where I can be outdoors
  all day in the Sierras doing physical labor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n

  week’s KA spotlight is on… Kitt Hirasaki!\n\nThis week’s spotlight is on one of
  our designers, Kitt, who has worked on building out Khan Academy’s community features
  and getting teachers the info they need about their students. Kitt is currently
  working on building free, world-class test prep for the new SAT. In the afternoons,
  you might find him hosting a chocolate and beer tasting or improv session for the
  office, but on game nights you’ll often find him playing a mean game of Coup, poker,
  or Bang! (pictured).\n\n\nWhere are you using your growth mindset?I’m always working
  to help my daughters develop growth mindsets, encouraging them to practice and persist.
  It’s come easily for one daughter and not the other, but I’m using a meta growth
  mindset about promoting her growth mindset. I’m also using a growth mindset to push
  myself to be the best father I can, pushing myself to find patience when I feel
  frustration, and setting aside what I want for my children so I can support them
  for what they need instead.\nI’m also using a growth mindset to continuously improve
  my design skills. I used it last weekend to start to overcome my past failures with
  hula-hooping, and I’m using it to improve my first-person-shooter player-vs-player
  skills, where my kill:killed ratio is currently about 1:10.\nWhat are your favorite
  names?When my wife was pregnant with our first child, we each made lists of names
  for the baby. “Adelaide” was the one that appeared on both my wife’s and my lists.
  A bit of insight into what I wanted to project onto my child, but I also had the
  names Cordelia, Beatrix, and Maeve on my list. For a boy, we could only agree on
  one name, and it’s pretty unusual: Tasman. Nickname “Taz.” (My wife’s an Australia-phile.)

  Khanversation with… medical expert Rishi Desai!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nThis
  week’s KA spotlight is on… Rishi Desai!\nRishi works connecting people to quality
  information about health and medicine. In addition to his work at Khan Academy on
  creating medical content, he is currently a pediatric infectious disease physician
  and previously spent two years at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
  (CDC). If you’re ever interested in venturing more into the medical world, check
  out our health and medicine content to see some of Rishi’s work for yourself.\nWhat
  is your greatest fear?Raccoons! The fear started when I was living in SF about 10
  years ago and I would occasionally come across a pack of them while taking out the
  trash. They’re clever, roam in packs, aggressive, and carry diseases (look up Baylisascaris!).
  [Editor’s note: do not do this. Or at least don’t Google Image Search it like I
  did.] My Room 101 would be loaded with these freaky little bandits!\nWhich talent
  would you most like to have?If I could have any talent it would be to play a sport
  really well - either badminton or basketball. I love them both and it would be awesome
  to play at a really high level.\nWhere would you like to live?I would love to live
  in a treehouse, with friends/family living in nearby trees. We would all work from
  home and spend our free time exploring the forest together. There is a bit of monkey-envy
  woven into this dream.\nWhich living person do you most admire?I really admire Jon
  Stewart. I think that he’s a brilliant interviewer/educator/comedian, with an incredible
  understanding of world issues/politics. It would be a dream to meet him some day.\nIf
  you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?I hope to become more
  mindful over time. I often catch myself thinking about the past or the future, and
  losing sight of “now”. I think that’s why I love being a pediatrician. Kids are
  really great at being present. =)\nInterview by Kate Mason.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n

  Khanversation with…sunny software dev Dylan Vassallo!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nDylan
  first started as an intern at Khan Academy in summer 2012, when we were just a couple
  dozen folks squishing into an older office space in downtown Mountain View. From
  his California upbringing and UCLA education, he brought a sunny, laidback demeanor
  with the ability to deliver. We were so happy when he decided to return fulltime,
  and he continues to bring that level of enthusiasm with him always. He always is
  excited to tackle the next project and join in the latest social event. From my
  biased international perspective, I am particularly excited that it was Dylan who
  first made Khan Academy international pages available, as the last part of his internship
  - to which we like to tease that he literally brought free education to the world.
  And this summer, continued this work on the infrastructure for our localized sites
  like Spanish, Portuguese, and French.  This is only the tip of the iceberg of what
  makes Dylan so great.  Check out his Khanversation below for more! \n\nDylan gets
  his game on for the annual KIPP Bay Area charter school ping pong tournamentWhat
  is your favorite journey?\nI have two, deal with it. One is taking 280 North (definitely
  not 101) from Mountain View up to Santa Rosa, where my family lives. Speeding Driving
  up 280 on a sunny Saturday morning with the windows down and music blasting always
  feels so good. My other favorite journey is driving down to LA—not because I love
  the smell of cow poop in the afternoon, but because it means that I’m about to relive
  the best parts of college with friends I haven’t seen in a while. I get a lot of
  thinking done on that drive, too. The last time I made that trip, though, I had
  the brilliant idea to try driving back up to Mountain View without stopping at all.
  I don’t recommend it; 6-ish hours later I pulled into the Chevron on Shoreline with
  a dangerously empty gas tank and stomach and a dangerously full bladder. But I was
  so proud of myself.\nWhat is your greatest extravagance?\nI love live music and
  try to catch it every chance I get. This spring and summer I made it to three festivals,
  a stadium tour, and a couple of other shows. I can’t get hearing damage until I’m
  26 and married*, right?\nWhen and where were you happiest?\nI wouldn’t say this
  makes me the absolute happiest I could possibly ever be, but watching just one episode—literally
  any episode—of 30 Rock will turn around the foulest of moods for me. That sounds
  trite, but nothing else does the trick as reliably as 30 Rock (although Portlandia
  is a runner-up). It’s like a magic happiness pill that takes effect in 25 minutes.\nWhat
  do you most value in your friends?\nMy best friends don’t take themselves too seriously.
  I’m not always great at this, but I’ve learned that if you can’t laugh at yourself
  then you’re making life a lot harder than it has to be.\nWhat is your motto?\nSir
  Arthur Conan Doyle said, “Life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind
  of man could invent.” That idea has been proven to me over and over again and is
  the only assumption I can safely make about the world. My love of people-watching
  is probably related to this.\n\n*“26 and married”: An intern once quipped that she
  wanted to hang out with people who were similar to her, not like those of us who
  were “26 and married”.  At the time, one person in the organization met the criteria.
  We refer to “26 and married” as the point in life beyond which the young think we
  cease to be cool.  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t

  we named our conference rooms so that we could say “let’s meet in _______” with
  amusing consequences. We found it entertaining, and over the years, it has continued
  for our visitors and growing team. \nHistorical Facebook post commemorating the
  new conference room names:\n\n\nWhen we moved offices and got a few more conference
  rooms, we added a few more names “Style”, “Ventive”, “Credible”, “Love, \"Diana
  Jones”, “Trouble”…you get the point.  Usually, we matched the type of room with
  the name. For example, “Sync’ was the kitchen (in the new office, it’s \"Digestion”),
  “Cognito” was a tiny windowless room that we used as a phone booth. “Trouble” is
  Sal’s office, etc.  \n\nToday, in this spirit, an unnamed individual added the latest
  to this line-up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t

  week’s KA spotlight is on…Zach Gotsch!\nZach believes that when everyone is educated,

  amazing decorations, and to Growth Mindset, Tea-Rex, and all the wonderfully costumed

  KA spotlight is on….Elizabeth Slavitt!  She was voted to Forbes’ 30 under 30, is
  blazingly smart, and will tackle any challenge that comes her way…but talking to
  her, you’ll notice a humble human being (and get distracted by her wonderfully curly
  hair and sarcastic wit). What is your idea of perfect happiness?Traveling somewhere
  I’ve never been with people I really love. What is your greatest fear?Inertia, stagnation,
  an unexamined life. What is your greatest extravagance?It’s-its. What is your most
  marked characteristic?I’m pretty earnest, though sometimes people can’t tell if
  I’m being super earnest or super sarcastic. And I have really curly hair, which
  is useful for finding me in a crowd. What do you most value in your friends?On Wednesdays
  we wear pink. What is your motto?I’m not sure if this is really a motto, but I think
  this E.B. White quote captures me pretty well: “I arise in the morning torn between
  a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world. This makes it hard
  to plan the day.”Tags:Tweet \n                                 \n                            \n

  week’s KA spotlight is on… James Irwin!James joined us in 2011 and helped build
  the first version of our internal content management tools—these days, you’ll find
  him taking care of our international sites (Spanish, Portuguese, French, and more)
  to help make sure that the 5+ billion people in the world who don’t speak English
  can get a free education too.Which historical figure do you most identify with?Richard
  Feynman. I read Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman, and What Do You Care What Other
  People Think when I was a teenager and I was greatly impressed not just by his intelligence
  but his basic attitude toward life.What is your greatest extravagance?All the travel
  I’ve done.What is your favorite journey?This one is tough. Backpacking in Patagonia,
  epic bus trip from Arusha to Victoria Falls, many various parts of my 6 month honeymoon
  before starting at KA (Siem Reap, Kilimanjaro, backpacking between villages in Turkey),
  Outward Bounds I took as a teenager all come to mind, the trip I took when I was
  20 where I ended up staying at a Buddhist monastery in Thailand (and smuggling in
  some beer for one of the monks), and then doing a week long hike in Nepal. For now
  I’ll go with a solo trip that I took from the school I taught at in Tanzania to
  where my sister was staying on the shores of Lake Malawi. It involved a bus trip
  to the border, sitting on the back of a bike as a guy pedaled the three miles to
  the border, a minibus up the steep slopes of the mountains on the northern section
  of Lake Malawi, and sitting in the back of a pickup truck on top of a bunch of sack
  of rice through the heartland. I don’t think I ever felt as free as then.When and
  where were you happiest?My second wedding celebration with Lucie (we had 3!) We
  had rented out small eccentric mountain hotel in Austria where we resaid our vows
  under a chandelier outdoors hanging from a tree in front of a small group of our
  friends and family. We stayed the entire weekend there in the place decorated with
  such things as a lifesize paper-mache astronaut, a gigantic yellow ox, fake chicken
  feet on the ceiling, and a rickshaw, and a picture of the last supper where all
  the apostles were mostly naked gay men.If you could change one thing about your
  family, what would it be?When I wanted them closer they would be. My in-laws are
  in Germany, my one sister and my two nieces are in Vienna, and my other sister,
  my mom, and my three nephews are in Budapest. This I normally consider to be a safe
  healthy distance, but at other times I wish they were closer and I could just pop
  on over to see them.What is your favorite occupation?My current one, though sometimes
  I fantasize about being a forest ranger, where I can be outdoors all day in the
  Sierras doing physical labor.Tweet \n                                 \n                            \n

  week’s KA spotlight is on… Kitt Hirasaki!This week’s spotlight is on one of our
  designers, Kitt, who has worked on building out Khan Academy’s community features
  and getting teachers the info they need about their students. Kitt is currently
  working on building free, world-class test prep for the new SAT. In the afternoons,
  you might find him hosting a chocolate and beer tasting or improv session for the
  office, but on game nights you’ll often find him playing a mean game of Coup, poker,
  or Bang! (pictured).Where are you using your growth mindset?I’m always working to
  help my daughters develop growth mindsets, encouraging them to practice and persist.
  It’s come easily for one daughter and not the other, but I’m using a meta growth
  mindset about promoting her growth mindset. I’m also using a growth mindset to push
  myself to be the best father I can, pushing myself to find patience when I feel
  frustration, and setting aside what I want for my children so I can support them
  for what they need instead.I’m also using a growth mindset to continuously improve
  my design skills. I used it last weekend to start to overcome my past failures with
  hula-hooping, and I’m using it to improve my first-person-shooter player-vs-player
  skills, where my kill:killed ratio is currently about 1:10.What are your favorite
  names?When my wife was pregnant with our first child, we each made lists of names
  for the baby. “Adelaide” was the one that appeared on both my wife’s and my lists.
  A bit of insight into what I wanted to project onto my child, but I also had the
  names Cordelia, Beatrix, and Maeve on my list. For a boy, we could only agree on
  one name, and it’s pretty unusual: Tasman. Nickname “Taz.” (My wife’s an Australia-phile.)

  week’s KA spotlight is on… Rishi Desai!Rishi works connecting people to quality
  information about health and medicine. In addition to his work at Khan Academy on
  creating medical content, he is currently a pediatric infectious disease physician
  and previously spent two years at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
  (CDC). If you’re ever interested in venturing more into the medical world, check
  out our health and medicine content to see some of Rishi’s work for yourself.What
  is your greatest fear?Raccoons! The fear started when I was living in SF about 10
  years ago and I would occasionally come across a pack of them while taking out the
  trash. They’re clever, roam in packs, aggressive, and carry diseases (look up Baylisascaris!).
  [Editor’s note: do not do this. Or at least don’t Google Image Search it like I
  did.] My Room 101 would be loaded with these freaky little bandits!Which talent
  would you most like to have?If I could have any talent it would be to play a sport
  really well - either badminton or basketball. I love them both and it would be awesome
  to play at a really high level.Where would you like to live?I would love to live
  in a treehouse, with friends/family living in nearby trees. We would all work from
  home and spend our free time exploring the forest together. There is a bit of monkey-envy
  woven into this dream.Which living person do you most admire?I really admire Jon
  Stewart. I think that he’s a brilliant interviewer/educator/comedian, with an incredible
  understanding of world issues/politics. It would be a dream to meet him some day.If
  you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?I hope to become more
  mindful over time. I often catch myself thinking about the past or the future, and
  losing sight of “now”. I think that’s why I love being a pediatrician. Kids are
  really great at being present. =)Interview by Kate Mason.Tweet \n                                 \n

  is your favorite journey?I have two, deal with it. One is taking 280 North (definitely
  not 101) from Mountain View up to Santa Rosa, where my family lives. Speeding Driving
  up 280 on a sunny Saturday morning with the windows down and music blasting always
  feels so good. My other favorite journey is driving down to LA—not because I love
  the smell of cow poop in the afternoon, but because it means that I’m about to relive
  the best parts of college with friends I haven’t seen in a while. I get a lot of
  thinking done on that drive, too. The last time I made that trip, though, I had
  the brilliant idea to try driving back up to Mountain View without stopping at all.
  I don’t recommend it; 6-ish hours later I pulled into the Chevron on Shoreline with
  a dangerously empty gas tank and stomach and a dangerously full bladder. But I was
  so proud of myself.What is your greatest extravagance?I love live music and try
  to catch it every chance I get. This spring and summer I made it to three festivals,
  a stadium tour, and a couple of other shows. I can’t get hearing damage until I’m
  26 and married*, right?When and where were you happiest?I wouldn’t say this makes
  me the absolute happiest I could possibly ever be, but watching just one episode—literally
  any episode—of 30 Rock will turn around the foulest of moods for me. That sounds
  trite, but nothing else does the trick as reliably as 30 Rock (although Portlandia
  is a runner-up). It’s like a magic happiness pill that takes effect in 25 minutes.What
  do you most value in your friends?My best friends don’t take themselves too seriously.
  I’m not always great at this, but I’ve learned that if you can’t laugh at yourself
  then you’re making life a lot harder than it has to be.What is your motto?Sir Arthur
  Conan Doyle said, “Life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man
  could invent.” That idea has been proven to me over and over again and is the only
  assumption I can safely make about the world. My love of people-watching is probably
  related to this.*“26 and married”: An intern once quipped that she wanted to hang
  out with people who were similar to her, not like those of us who were “26 and married”.
   At the time, one person in the organization met the criteria. We refer to “26 and
  married” as the point in life beyond which the young think we cease to be cool.

  years ago, we named our conference rooms so that we could say “let’s meet in _______”
  with amusing consequences. We found it entertaining, and over the years, it has
  continued for our visitors and growing team. Historical Facebook post commemorating
  the new conference room names:When we moved offices and got a few more conference
  rooms, we added a few more names “Style”, “Ventive”, “Credible”, “Love, \"Diana
  Jones”, “Trouble”…you get the point.  Usually, we matched the type of room with
  the name. For example, “Sync’ was the kitchen (in the new office, it’s \"Digestion”),
  “Cognito” was a tiny windowless room that we used as a phone booth. “Trouble” is
  Sal’s office, etc.  Today, in this spirit, an unnamed individual added the latest
  to this line-up.Tags:Tweet \n                                 \n                            \n
