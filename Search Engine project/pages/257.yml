                  ALIENATION IN CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY
- |2
                  Alienation, in theology, refers to the idea that
- |2
                      the relation of the worshippers to God may be analogous to the
- |2
                      alienation, or estrangement, between human beings. The word implies that a
- |2
                      close relationship of affection, family, friendship, or another close tie
- |2
                      has been broken, often with detrimental effects on the psyche. The
- |2
                      disorganization of the self, worries about guilt, and loss of identity
- |2
                      which the breaking of a long and very close bond between people may
- |2
                      bring are all familiar. The idea that man, by his sin and
- |2
                      indifference, may similarly alienate himself from a loving Father is a
- |2
                      distinguishing feature of the Judaic and Christian religious traditions.
- |2
                  The Judaic conception of God and his people came increasingly to be of a
- |2
                      familial situation. The story of the creation and fall of man stresses the
- |2
                      point that Adam and Eve were both disobedient and potentially
- |2
                      dangerous to the high God, since they were ambitious of raising themselves
- |2
                      to divine status and might find the means of doing so (Genesis 1:22).
- |2
                      Jehovah appears as a jealous ruler. But there is a critical change
- |2
                      when the Lord adopts Abram as a son, as a child is adopted, giving him
- |2
                      the new name Abraham (Genesis 17), just as later, Jacob is renamed Israel.
- |2
                      God is thought of
- |2
                       not merely as the familiar protector of a nation, but, uniquely
- |2
                      among ancient cults, as the Father of a human family—the tribes
- |2
                      of Israel. The paradigm of the fam- ily, with its
- |2
                      tensions of affection, hate, loyalties, and fears, permeates the Old
- |2
                      Testament. Again and again the children are disobedient and become
- |2
                      estranged from their Father: again and again, there is recon- ciliation between a sorrowing,
- |2
                      merciful but divine parent and his loved, but wayward, family. As in a
- |2
                      human family, there is a separation between faithful, appreciative siblings
- |2
                      and willful, rebellious ones. Some- times the
- |2
                      children wander off to other gods in place of their own Father.
- |2
                  The prophets are the agents through whom God communicates his love for his
- |2
                      children, his repeated disappointment and anger over their behavior, and
- |2
                      his plans for effecting a final reconciliation. The prophets do not
- |2
                      merely warn of terrible punishments if the chosen people continue to
- |2
                      disobey the Lord: they constantly use figures from the patriarchal family
- |2
                      to embody their message. In one of the most poignant passages of the
- |2
                      Old Testament, Hosea represents the Lord yearning over his people Israel
- |2
                      just as a patriarch might speak of his sons:
- "                \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my
- |2
                              son. The more I called them, the more they went from me; they kept
- |2
                              sacrificing to the Baals, and burn- ing
- |2
                              incense to idols. Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk, I took
- |2
                              them up in my arms; but they did not know that I healed them. I led
- |2
                              them with cords of compassion, with the bands of love;... and I
- |2
                              bent down to them and fed them.... How can I give you up, O
- |2
                              Ephraim!... My heart recoils within me, my compassion grows
- |2
                              warm and tender
- "                    \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          (Hosea 11:1-8, Revised Standard Version).
- "                    \n"
- "                \n"
- |2
                  Elsewhere, the relationship is that of husband and wife: “And in
- |2
                      that day, says the Lord, you will call me, 'My husband,' and no longer will
- |2
                      you call me, 'My baal'” (Hosea 2:16).
- |2
                  It is hard to find anything in other world-religions to compare with this
- |2
                      moving, divine domestic drama. Even in Islam, Allah appears as judge and
- |2
                      sustainer of order only; man is created to fulfill the amr, the divine commandment. In Neo-Platonism, it has been
- |2
                      asserted, there is a form of alienation, for man is seen as separated from
- |2
                      his true divine source and home. The soul has been corrupted by matter, the
- |2
                      lowest stage of the emanations from the One, and so has turned away
- |2
                      from its higher origin, the Intellect. The very metaphysical structure and
- |2
                      impersonality of this sys- tem, however,
- |2
                      precludes anything like the relationships and dynamic tensions among
- |2
                      different psyches which are implied in alienation as we have defined it.
- |2
                      The process of return to the Intellect, which certainly never yearns
- |2
                      over a lost soul, in fact implies something like035
- |2
                       de-personalization. Love, for example, must be univer- salized and purified from being
- |2
                      directed to any one person or object. Similarly, in Manicheism, two
- |2
                      powers, neither of which is a true personality, fight for domina- tion. Mankind, like the hero of a fairy
- |2
                      tale, is held by enchantment in a dark prison—this world. He can
- |2
                      be rescued only by being taught the secret of his true nature as a
- |2
                      child of light, and through learning thau-
- |2
                          maturgic formulas which will enable him to escape to his
- |2
                      heavenly home.
- |2
                  Alienation-reconciliation is the central pattern of Saint Paul's
- |2
                      interpretation of salvation. In adjusting the Hebraic tradition of a chosen
- |2
                      people to a universal religion, however, he necessarily had to make
- |2
                      some extremely important changes. The later prophets had begun to
- |2
                      think of ultimate redemption in terms of all mankind, not just Israel. Paul
- |2
                      completed the trans- formation: all of
- |2
                      the human race are members of God's family, and so all human beings
- |2
                      necessarily have be- come alienated from their
- |2
                      Father. Obviously, there must have sprung up serious faults in basic
- |2
                      human nature which have estranged all men, not merely some, from God.
- |2
                      There is a generalized malaise in the human experience, alienated as all
- |2
                      men are from the source of all truth and values. Paul implies that for the
- |2
                      Jewish people the alienation was at least partially cured; addressing
- |2
                      the Gentiles, he recalls their desperate situ-
- |2
                      ation before Christ:
- "                \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          ... remember that you were at that time separated from Christ,
- |2
                              alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the
- |2
                              covenants of promise having no hope and without God in the
- |2
                          world
- "                    \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          (Ephesians 2:12).
- "                    \n"
- "                \n"
- |2
                  He describes the plight of fallen man in terms of what the psychiatrist
- |2
                      would immediately recognize as “al-
- |2
                          ienation”:
- "                \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          And you, who once were estranged and hostile in mind, doing evil
- |2
                              deeds, he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his
- |2
                          death,...
- "                    \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          (Colossians 1:21).
- "                    \n"
- "                \n"
- |2
                  This statement demonstrates that alienation and rec- onciliation are always combined in Paul's teaching,
- |2
                      for salvation is reconciliation with God. The Father has reunited and
- |2
                      gathered his estranged human family, not by revealing the law through
- |2
                      prophets, not by sending a teacher to reveal the secret way out of this
- |2
                      evil world, but by curing human nature through joining the divine with
- |2
                      the human. In the union of the two in Christ's unified personality,
- |2
                      alienation has ended. The Christian message, Paul stresses again and again,
- |2
                      is that “God through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave
- |2
                      us the ministry of reconciliation” (II Corinthians 5:18).
- |2
                      The Christian is “reconciled to God.” Thus it would
- |2
                      be illuminating to speak of the “alienating sin”
- |2
                      instead of “original sin” and of redemption as “reconciliation.”
- |2
                       Whether this emphasis would survive in Christianity became the
- |2
                      great issue of the first and second centuries.
- |2
                  Opposed to such a view of salvation was the move-
- |2
                      ment known as “Gnosticism.” Although it took a
- |2
                      vast number of forms, this sect essentially continued Manicheism with
- |2
                      Christian coloration. The good God, it taught, is not the creator and ruler
- |2
                      of the irre- deemably evil world in which
- |2
                      man lives and suffers. Men, however, have a spark of
- |2
                      “light” which can enable them to escape. Christ was a
- |2
                      heavenly spirit, child of a heavenly spirit; both he and his mother
- |2
                      were human only in appearance, having no real bodies. Christ's mission
- |2
                      was to reveal the gnosis, the secret wisdom. The
- |2
                      whole thrust is that Christ did not join divine and
- |2
                      human personalities. There is no recon-
- |2
                          ciliation, here, nor any analogy with human experience. Man is
- |2
                      saved by totally rejecting material nature, by heroic denial of one side of
- |2
                      his being. It is inter- esting to speculate
- |2
                      as to what kind of world we should have if, say, the Albigensians of the
- |2
                      Middle Ages, who apparently carried on this kind of belief, had
- |2
                      triumphed.
- |2
                  In the late second century, Saint Irenaeus, in a clas-
- |2
                          sical attack on Gnosticism, stated the essence of the great
- |2
                      division in Christianity:
- "                \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          ... if we devise another substance of our Lord's Flesh, then will
- |2
                              his statement about Reconciliation no longer hang together. For
- |2
                              that only is reconciled, which at one time was in enmity. But if
- |2
                              our Lord brought with Him flesh of another substance, then no
- |2
                              longer was the same thing rec-
- |2
                              onciled to God, which by transgression has become hostile.
- |2
                              But now by Man's participation of Himself our Lord hath reconciled
- |2
                              him to God the Father
- "                    \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          (Against the Heresies, trans. John Keble,
- |2
                              V:14:3).
- "                    \n"
- "                \n"
- |2
                  Irenaeus adds an important idea: that under the Mosaic law, Israel was never
- |2
                      truly reconciled with God, but was only in a
- |2
                      “servile” state; now God has truly adopted all
- |2
                      mankind, without favoritism, and men once more are his
- |2
                      “sons.” Hence they should have both more fear and
- |2
                      love of God; “for sons ought to fear more than slaves, and to
- |2
                      have greater love towards their Father” (ibid., IV:16:5). This
- |2
                      paradoxical combination underlies the conception of Christian liberty, and
- |2
                      it could exist only in a relationship of alienation- reconciliation.
- |2
                  Saint Augustine in the course of his spiritual wan-
- |2
                          derings became a Manichean, and he left that sect precisely
- |2
                      because it offered no hope of real recon-
- |2
                          ciliation with the Father. He says, in a sermon for Christmas,
- |2
                      that God, “... remaining God, was made man, so that even as the
- |2
                      Son of man he is rightly calledGod with us, not 'God in the one case, man in the
- |2
                      other.'” How could Christ, if we believe, with the Gnostics, in
- |2
                      the “crucifixion of a phantasm,” abolish036
- |2
                       the “enmity” which man's sins have created
- |2
                      between him and God? (Confessions 5:19).
- |2
                  Augustine's spiritual quest was for a faith that would combine a return to a
- |2
                      reconciliation with God, and to a strong sense that the Deity is truly
- |2
                      transcendent and omnipotent; hence his struggles to formulate free
- |2
                      will in accordance with divine power. So he vehe-
- |2
                          mently opposed the Pelagians, who denied that man's nature is
- |2
                      intrinsically alienated by sin, and that anyone may, like the prodigal son,
- |2
                      decide on his own volition to arise and return to his Father.
- |2
                      Augustine—and the mainstream of Christianity after his
- |2
                      time—emphasized the one-sidedness of the reconciliation. Only as
- |2
                          om- nipotent God reaches out to the
- |2
                      individual soul can reconciliation begin. Augustine's Confessions
- |2
                      elo- quently expresses the idea that natural
- |2
                      man suffers from naturally incurable psychical unrest and distress,
- |2
                      and therefore yearns for something to save him; and it expresses the
- |2
                      joy, the sense of repose and contentment when his estrangement from his
- |2
                      Father is ended.
- |2
                  Augustine, following a concept implied in the prophets, describes another
- |2
                      kind of alienation. The human family itself, which should live in
- |2
                      harmony under the Fatherhood of its God, continues in an in- curable state of estrangement within itself.
- |2
                      Believers (the adopted people) and unbelievers, even though living and
- |2
                      working side by side, are really in deep enmity. This alienation, moreover,
- |2
                      is deceptive. The eye of worldly wisdom regards the City of God as
- |2
                      composed simply of malcontents, since it is out of sympathy with the ideals
- |2
                      and convictions of the “world,” which often professes
- |2
                      good ideals and inten- tions. But, of course,
- |2
                      it really is the “world” that is alienated from the
- |2
                      source of all goodness. Thus there has been a continuing impression that
- |2
                      alienation within society is inevitable, and that the righteous are perma- nently estranged from the
- |2
                      “establishment,” the domi-
- |2
                      nant powers of the world.
- |2
                  Medieval scholasticism attempted to bring into a syncretic harmony the many
- |2
                      strains of thought that had gone into Christianity. The pattern of alienation- reconciliation was
- |2
                      not dropped, but the desire to find precise metaphysical formulation for
- |2
                      the experience of salvation greatly reduced it in importance. Saint
- |2
                      Thomas Aquinas, for example, defining the end in life as—in
- |2
                      Aristotelian terms—pure contemplation, envi- sioned something quite different from the recon- ciliation of personalities Paul
- |2
                      described. The meta- physical definitions
- |2
                      inevitably reduced the impression of immediate relationships between God
- |2
                      and man. On the other side, the medieval mystical tradition, with its
- |2
                      goal of absorption of the individual soul into the divine, worked against
- |2
                      the conception of recon- ciliation, which
- |2
                      implies the continuation of the indi
- |2
                      vidual self in all its integrity. Augustine certainly would have
- |2
                      wished for a mind at one with God's, but not to cease to be Augustine.
- |2
                      Finally, the obsession in popular religion with a crudely thaumaturgic
- |2
                          salva- tion—sin being purged by
- |2
                      rituals, relics, pardons, etc.—reduced the sense of alienation
- |2
                      and recon- ciliation.
- |2
                  Essential to Martin Luther's reform was a return to Irenaeus' point: that
- |2
                      man is redeemed when he returns to become again, literally, a child of God.
- |2
                      Luther puts the point in homely, deliberately nontheological terms,
- |2
                      like speeches in a domestic drama:
- "                \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          Christ says: formerly you were my enemies; but now you are friends
- |2
                              because I regard you as friends, not because you do many good
- |2
                              things to Me.... I die for the sort of friends who have done Me no
- |2
                              good. I have just loved them and made them my friends...
- "                    \n"
- "                    \n"
- |2
                          (Commentary on John 15).
- "                    \n"
- "                \n"
- |2
                  God, like a (medieval) father, plays and sports with his children,
- |2
                      pretending to be enraged with them to test their loyalty. Christ, unlike
- |2
                      angels, lived with us, “ate, drank, became angry, prayed, became
- |2
                      sad, cried.” And in Luther, as commonly in Christianity, there
- |2
                      is an implication, very strong if seldom clearly defined, that it is
- |2
                      better for the human soul to have undergone alienation with subsequent
- |2
                      reconciliation than it would have been never to have been estranged from
- |2
                      God. The joy over the return of the prodigal son was greater than that
- |2
                      over the continued faithfulness of his brother. In any event, the relation
- |2
                      of a husband and wife, or of friends who have been seriously estranged and
- |2
                      then reconciled, is very different from what it was at first. The fall
- |2
                      of man was a felix culpa, then, in the sense
- |2
                      that a new and perhaps deeper relation of God to man has been established,
- |2
                      symbolized by the cross. A mys- tique of
- |2
                      alienation has been evident throughout the history of Christianity.
- |2
                  Thus in Western civilization the condition of aliena-
- |2
                          tion has, so to speak, been institutionalized in religion. The
- |2
                      expectation that alienation is part of the human condition has endured even
- |2
                      when specific Christian belief has gone. Romanticism viewed man as
- |2
                          “alien- ated” from
- |2
                      nature. Wordsworth's The Prelude, for ex- ample, tells the story of a boy, nurtured by the
- |2
                      divine Spirit of nature, subsequently alienated from it by the
- |2
                      temptations and corruptions of civilization, and finally reconciled. In one
- |2
                      very important respect, however, the tradition has changed it. The
- |2
                      Judeo-Christian reli- gions, as we have seen,
- |2
                      closely connected alienation and reconciliation. The gloom of the Christian
- |2
                      doctrine of “original sin” is greatly lightened by
- |2
                      the idea that this condition is a kind of nightmare from which those
- |2
                      who receive grace have awakened. It is the dark before the light. Modern
- |2
                      views of man as alienated, however,037
- |2
                       have no such solution of the dilemma. Man appears to be
- |2
                      afflicted by this state, but its cause and cure are uncertain. Hence we
- |2
                      have lost the paradoxical sense of optimism that accompanied the idea of
- |2
                      alienation in Christianity.

               Dictionary of the History of IdeasAlienation, in theology, refers to the idea that
- |2
                      the relation of the worshippers to God may be analogous to the
- |2
                      alienation, or estrangement, between human beings. The word implies that a
- |2
                      close relationship of affection, family, friendship, or another close tie
- |2
                      has been broken, often with detrimental effects on the psyche. The
- |2
                      disorganization of the self, worries about guilt, and loss of identity
- |2
                      which the breaking of a long and very close bond between people may
- |2
                      bring are all familiar. The idea that man, by his sin and
- |2
                      indifference, may similarly alienate himself from a loving Father is a
- |2
                      distinguishing feature of the Judaic and Christian religious traditions.The Judaic conception of God and his people came increasingly to be of a
- |2
                      familial situation. The story of the creation and fall of man stresses the
- |2
                      point that Adam and Eve were both disobedient and potentially
- |2
                      dangerous to the high God, since they were ambitious of raising themselves
- |2
                      to divine status and might find the means of doing so (Genesis 1:22).
- |2
                      Jehovah appears as a jealous ruler. But there is a critical change
- |2
                      when the Lord adopts Abram as a son, as a child is adopted, giving him
- |2
                      the new name Abraham (Genesis 17), just as later, Jacob is renamed Israel.
- |2
                      God is thought of
- |2
                       not merely as the familiar protector of a nation, but, uniquely
- |2
                      among ancient cults, as the Father of a human family—the tribes
- |2
                      of Israel. The paradigm of the fam- ily, with its
- |2
                      tensions of affection, hate, loyalties, and fears, permeates the Old
- |2
                      Testament. Again and again the children are disobedient and become
- |2
                      estranged from their Father: again and again, there is recon- ciliation between a sorrowing,
- |2
                      merciful but divine parent and his loved, but wayward, family. As in a
- |2
                      human family, there is a separation between faithful, appreciative siblings
- |2
                      and willful, rebellious ones. Some- times the
- |2
                      children wander off to other gods in place of their own Father.The prophets are the agents through whom God communicates his love for his
- |2
                      children, his repeated disappointment and anger over their behavior, and
- |2
                      his plans for effecting a final reconciliation. The prophets do not
- |2
                      merely warn of terrible punishments if the chosen people continue to
- |2
                      disobey the Lord: they constantly use figures from the patriarchal family
- |2
                      to embody their message. In one of the most poignant passages of the
- |2
                      Old Testament, Hosea represents the Lord yearning over his people Israel
- |2
                      just as a patriarch might speak of his sons:When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my
- |2
                              son. The more I called them, the more they went from me; they kept
- |2
                              sacrificing to the Baals, and burn- ing
- |2
                              incense to idols. Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk, I took
- |2
                              them up in my arms; but they did not know that I healed them. I led
- |2
                              them with cords of compassion, with the bands of love;... and I
- |2
                              bent down to them and fed them.... How can I give you up, O
- |2
                              Ephraim!... My heart recoils within me, my compassion grows
- |2
                              warm and tender
- |2
                          (Hosea 11:1-8, Revised Standard Version).
- |2
                      Elsewhere, the relationship is that of husband and wife: “And in

                      that day, says the Lord, you will call me, 'My husband,' and no longer will
- |2
                      you call me, 'My baal'” (Hosea 2:16).It is hard to find anything in other world-religions to compare with this
- |2
                      moving, divine domestic drama. Even in Islam, Allah appears as judge and
- |2
                      sustainer of order only; man is created to fulfill the amr, the divine commandment. In Neo-Platonism, it has been
- |2
                      asserted, there is a form of alienation, for man is seen as separated from
- |2
                      his true divine source and home. The soul has been corrupted by matter, the
- |2
                      lowest stage of the emanations from the One, and so has turned away
- |2
                      from its higher origin, the Intellect. The very metaphysical structure and
- |2
                      impersonality of this sys- tem, however,
- |2
                      precludes anything like the relationships and dynamic tensions among
- |2
                      different psyches which are implied in alienation as we have defined it.
- |2
                      The process of return to the Intellect, which certainly never yearns
- |2
                      over a lost soul, in fact implies something likeAlienation-reconciliation is the central pattern of Saint Paul's
- |2
                      interpretation of salvation. In adjusting the Hebraic tradition of a chosen
- |2
                      people to a universal religion, however, he necessarily had to make
- |2
                      some extremely important changes. The later prophets had begun to
- |2
                      think of ultimate redemption in terms of all mankind, not just Israel. Paul
- |2
                      completed the trans- formation: all of
- |2
                      the human race are members of God's family, and so all human beings
- |2
                      necessarily have be- come alienated from their
- |2
                      Father. Obviously, there must have sprung up serious faults in basic
- |2
                      human nature which have estranged all men, not merely some, from God.
- |2
                      There is a generalized malaise in the human experience, alienated as all
- |2
                      men are from the source of all truth and values. Paul implies that for the
- |2
                      Jewish people the alienation was at least partially cured; addressing
- |2
                      the Gentiles, he recalls their desperate situ-
- |2
                      ation before Christ:... remember that you were at that time separated from Christ,
- |2
                              alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the
- |2
                              covenants of promise having no hope and without God in the
- |2
                          world
- |2
                          (Ephesians 2:12).
- |2
                      He describes the plight of fallen man in terms of what the psychiatrist
- |2
                      would immediately recognize as “al-
- |2
                          ienation”:And you, who once were estranged and hostile in mind, doing evil
- |2
                              deeds, he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his
- |2
                          death,...
- |2
                          (Colossians 1:21).
- |2
                      This statement demonstrates that alienation and rec- onciliation are always combined in Paul's teaching,
- |2
                      for salvation is reconciliation with God. The Father has reunited and
- |2
                      gathered his estranged human family, not by revealing the law through
- |2
                      prophets, not by sending a teacher to reveal the secret way out of this
- |2
                      evil world, but by curing human nature through joining the divine with
- |2
                      the human. In the union of the two in Christ's unified personality,
- |2
                      alienation has ended. The Christian message, Paul stresses again and again,
- |2
                      is that “God through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave
- |2
                      us the ministry of reconciliation” (II Corinthians 5:18).
- |2
                      The Christian is “reconciled to God.” Thus it would
- |2
                      be illuminating to speak of the “alienating sin”
- |2
                      instead of “original sin” and of redemption as “reconciliation.”
- |2
                       Whether this emphasis would survive in Christianity became the
- |2
                      great issue of the first and second centuries.Opposed to such a view of salvation was the move-
- |2
                      ment known as “Gnosticism.” Although it took a
- |2
                      vast number of forms, this sect essentially continued Manicheism with
- |2
                      Christian coloration. The good God, it taught, is not the creator and ruler
- |2
                      of the irre- deemably evil world in which
- |2
                      man lives and suffers. Men, however, have a spark of
- |2
                      “light” which can enable them to escape. Christ was a
- |2
                      heavenly spirit, child of a heavenly spirit; both he and his mother
- |2
                      were human only in appearance, having no real bodies. Christ's mission
- |2
                      was to reveal the gnosis, the secret wisdom. The
- |2
                      whole thrust is that Christ did not join divine and
- |2
                      human personalities. There is no recon-
- |2
                          ciliation, here, nor any analogy with human experience. Man is
- |2
                      saved by totally rejecting material nature, by heroic denial of one side of
- |2
                      his being. It is inter- esting to speculate
- |2
                      as to what kind of world we should have if, say, the Albigensians of the
- |2
                      Middle Ages, who apparently carried on this kind of belief, had
- |2
                      triumphed.In the late second century, Saint Irenaeus, in a clas-
- |2
                          sical attack on Gnosticism, stated the essence of the great
- |2
                      division in Christianity:... if we devise another substance of our Lord's Flesh, then will
- |2
                              his statement about Reconciliation no longer hang together. For
- |2
                              that only is reconciled, which at one time was in enmity. But if
- |2
                              our Lord brought with Him flesh of another substance, then no
- |2
                              longer was the same thing rec-
- |2
                              onciled to God, which by transgression has become hostile.
- |2
                              But now by Man's participation of Himself our Lord hath reconciled
- |2
                              him to God the Father
- |2
                          (Against the Heresies, trans. John Keble,
- |2
                              V:14:3).
- |2
                      Irenaeus adds an important idea: that under the Mosaic law, Israel was never
- |2
                      truly reconciled with God, but was only in a
- |2
                      “servile” state; now God has truly adopted all
- |2
                      mankind, without favoritism, and men once more are his
- |2
                      “sons.” Hence they should have both more fear and
- |2
                      love of God; “for sons ought to fear more than slaves, and to
- |2
                      have greater love towards their Father” (ibid., IV:16:5). This
- |2
                      paradoxical combination underlies the conception of Christian liberty, and
- |2
                      it could exist only in a relationship of alienation- reconciliation.Saint Augustine in the course of his spiritual wan-
- |2
                          derings became a Manichean, and he left that sect precisely
- |2
                      because it offered no hope of real recon-
- |2
                          ciliation with the Father. He says, in a sermon for Christmas,
- |2
                      that God, “... remaining God, was made man, so that even as the
- |2
                      Son of man he is rightly calledGod with us, not 'God in the one case, man in the
- |2
                      other.'” How could Christ, if we believe, with the Gnostics, in
- |2
                      the “crucifixion of a phantasm,” abolishAugustine's spiritual quest was for a faith that would combine a return to a
- |2
                      reconciliation with God, and to a strong sense that the Deity is truly
- |2
                      transcendent and omnipotent; hence his struggles to formulate free
- |2
                      will in accordance with divine power. So he vehe-
- |2
                          mently opposed the Pelagians, who denied that man's nature is
- |2
                      intrinsically alienated by sin, and that anyone may, like the prodigal son,
- |2
                      decide on his own volition to arise and return to his Father.
- |2
                      Augustine—and the mainstream of Christianity after his
- |2
                      time—emphasized the one-sidedness of the reconciliation. Only as
- |2
                          om- nipotent God reaches out to the
- |2
                      individual soul can reconciliation begin. Augustine's Confessions
- |2
                      elo- quently expresses the idea that natural
- |2
                      man suffers from naturally incurable psychical unrest and distress,
- |2
                      and therefore yearns for something to save him; and it expresses the
- |2
                      joy, the sense of repose and contentment when his estrangement from his
- |2
                      Father is ended.Augustine, following a concept implied in the prophets, describes another
- |2
                      kind of alienation. The human family itself, which should live in
- |2
                      harmony under the Fatherhood of its God, continues in an in- curable state of estrangement within itself.
- |2
                      Believers (the adopted people) and unbelievers, even though living and
- |2
                      working side by side, are really in deep enmity. This alienation, moreover,
- |2
                      is deceptive. The eye of worldly wisdom regards the City of God as
- |2
                      composed simply of malcontents, since it is out of sympathy with the ideals
- |2
                      and convictions of the “world,” which often professes
- |2
                      good ideals and inten- tions. But, of course,
- |2
                      it really is the “world” that is alienated from the
- |2
                      source of all goodness. Thus there has been a continuing impression that
- |2
                      alienation within society is inevitable, and that the righteous are perma- nently estranged from the
- |2
                      “establishment,” the domi-
- |2
                      nant powers of the world.Medieval scholasticism attempted to bring into a syncretic harmony the many
- |2
                      strains of thought that had gone into Christianity. The pattern of alienation- reconciliation was
- |2
                      not dropped, but the desire to find precise metaphysical formulation for
- |2
                      the experience of salvation greatly reduced it in importance. Saint
- |2
                      Thomas Aquinas, for example, defining the end in life as—in
- |2
                      Aristotelian terms—pure contemplation, envi- sioned something quite different from the recon- ciliation of personalities Paul
- |2
                      described. The meta- physical definitions
- |2
                      inevitably reduced the impression of immediate relationships between God
- |2
                      and man. On the other side, the medieval mystical tradition, with its
- |2
                      goal of absorption of the individual soul into the divine, worked against
- |2
                      the conception of recon- ciliation, which
- |2
                      implies the continuation of the indi
- |2
                      vidual self in all its integrity. Augustine certainly would have
- |2
                      wished for a mind at one with God's, but not to cease to be Augustine.
- |2
                      Finally, the obsession in popular religion with a crudely thaumaturgic
- |2
                          salva- tion—sin being purged by
- |2
                      rituals, relics, pardons, etc.—reduced the sense of alienation
- |2
                      and recon- ciliation.Essential to Martin Luther's reform was a return to Irenaeus' point: that
- |2
                      man is redeemed when he returns to become again, literally, a child of God.
- |2
                      Luther puts the point in homely, deliberately nontheological terms,
- |2
                      like speeches in a domestic drama:Christ says: formerly you were my enemies; but now you are friends
- |2
                              because I regard you as friends, not because you do many good
- |2
                              things to Me.... I die for the sort of friends who have done Me no
- |2
                              good. I have just loved them and made them my friends...
- |2
                          (Commentary on John 15).
- |2
                      God, like a (medieval) father, plays and sports with his children,
- |2
                      pretending to be enraged with them to test their loyalty. Christ, unlike
- |2
                      angels, lived with us, “ate, drank, became angry, prayed, became
- |2
                      sad, cried.” And in Luther, as commonly in Christianity, there
- |2
                      is an implication, very strong if seldom clearly defined, that it is
- |2
                      better for the human soul to have undergone alienation with subsequent
- |2
                      reconciliation than it would have been never to have been estranged from
- |2
                      God. The joy over the return of the prodigal son was greater than that
- |2
                      over the continued faithfulness of his brother. In any event, the relation
- |2
                      of a husband and wife, or of friends who have been seriously estranged and
- |2
                      then reconciled, is very different from what it was at first. The fall
- |2
                      of man was a felix culpa, then, in the sense
- |2
                      that a new and perhaps deeper relation of God to man has been established,
- |2
                      symbolized by the cross. A mys- tique of
- |2
                      alienation has been evident throughout the history of Christianity.Thus in Western civilization the condition of aliena-
- |2
                          tion has, so to speak, been institutionalized in religion. The
- |2
                      expectation that alienation is part of the human condition has endured even
- |2
                      when specific Christian belief has gone. Romanticism viewed man as
- |2
                          “alien- ated” from
- |2
                      nature. Wordsworth's The Prelude, for ex- ample, tells the story of a boy, nurtured by the
- |2
                      divine Spirit of nature, subsequently alienated from it by the
- |2
                      temptations and corruptions of civilization, and finally reconciled. In one
- |2
                      very important respect, however, the tradition has changed it. The
- |2
                      Judeo-Christian reli- gions, as we have seen,
- |2
                      closely connected alienation and reconciliation. The gloom of the Christian
- |2
                      doctrine of “original sin” is greatly lightened by
- |2
                      the idea that this condition is a kind of nightmare from which those
- |2
                      who receive grace have awakened. It is the dark before the light. Modern

  \               ALIENATION IN CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY\n                Alienation, in
  theology, refers to the idea that\n                    the relation of the worshippers
  to God may be analogous to the\n                    alienation, or estrangement,
  between human beings. The word implies that a\n                    close relationship
  of affection, family, friendship, or another close tie\n                    has
  been broken, often with detrimental effects on the psyche. The\n                    disorganization
  of the self, worries about guilt, and loss of identity\n                    which
  the breaking of a long and very close bond between people may\n                    bring
  are all familiar. The idea that man, by his sin and\n                    indifference,
  may similarly alienate himself from a loving Father is a\n                    distinguishing
  feature of the Judaic and Christian religious traditions.\n                The Judaic
  conception of God and his people came increasingly to be of a\n                    familial
  situation. The story of the creation and fall of man stresses the\n                    point
  that Adam and Eve were both disobedient and potentially\n                    dangerous
  to the high God, since they were ambitious of raising themselves\n                    to
  divine status and might find the means of doing so (Genesis 1:22).\n                    Jehovah
  appears as a jealous ruler. But there is a critical change\n                    when
  the Lord adopts Abram as a son, as a child is adopted, giving him\n                    the
  new name Abraham (Genesis 17), just as later, Jacob is renamed Israel.\n                    God
  is thought of\n                     not merely as the familiar protector of a nation,
  but, uniquely\n                    among ancient cults, as the Father of a human
  family—the tribes\n                    of Israel. The paradigm of the fam- ily,
  with its\n                    tensions of affection, hate, loyalties, and fears,
  permeates the Old\n                    Testament. Again and again the children are
  disobedient and become\n                    estranged from their Father: again and
  again, there is recon- ciliation between a sorrowing,\n                    merciful
  but divine parent and his loved, but wayward, family. As in a\n                    human
  family, there is a separation between faithful, appreciative siblings\n                    and
  willful, rebellious ones. Some- times the\n                    children wander off
  to other gods in place of their own Father.\n                The prophets are the
  agents through whom God communicates his love for his\n                    children,
  his repeated disappointment and anger over their behavior, and\n                    his
  plans for effecting a final reconciliation. The prophets do not\n                    merely
  warn of terrible punishments if the chosen people continue to\n                    disobey
  the Lord: they constantly use figures from the patriarchal family\n                    to
  embody their message. In one of the most poignant passages of the\n                    Old
  Testament, Hosea represents the Lord yearning over his people Israel\n                    just
  as a patriarch might speak of his sons:\n                \n                    \n
  \                       When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I
  called my\n                            son. The more I called them, the more they
  went from me; they kept\n                            sacrificing to the Baals, and
  burn- ing\n                            incense to idols. Yet it was I who taught
  Ephraim to walk, I took\n                            them up in my arms; but they
  did not know that I healed them. I led\n                            them with cords
  of compassion, with the bands of love;... and I\n                            bent
  down to them and fed them.... How can I give you up, O\n                            Ephraim!...
  My heart recoils within me, my compassion grows\n                            warm
  and tender\n                    \n                    \n                        (Hosea
  11:1-8, Revised Standard Version).\n                    \n                \n                Elsewhere,
  the relationship is that of husband and wife: “And in\n                    that
  day, says the Lord, you will call me, 'My husband,' and no longer will\n                    you
  call me, 'My baal'” (Hosea 2:16).\n                It is hard to find anything in
  other world-religions to compare with this\n                    moving, divine domestic
  drama. Even in Islam, Allah appears as judge and\n                    sustainer
  of order only; man is created to fulfill the amr, the divine commandment. In Neo-Platonism,
  it has been\n                    asserted, there is a form of alienation, for man
  is seen as separated from\n                    his true divine source and home.
  The soul has been corrupted by matter, the\n                    lowest stage of
  the emanations from the One, and so has turned away\n                    from its
  higher origin, the Intellect. The very metaphysical structure and\n                    impersonality
  of this sys- tem, however,\n                    precludes anything like the relationships
  and dynamic tensions among\n                    different psyches which are implied
  in alienation as we have defined it.\n                    The process of return
  to the Intellect, which certainly never yearns\n                    over a lost
  soul, in fact implies something like035\n                     de-personalization.
  Love, for example, must be univer- salized and purified from being\n                    directed
  to any one person or object. Similarly, in Manicheism, two\n                    powers,
  neither of which is a true personality, fight for domina- tion. Mankind, like the
  hero of a fairy\n                    tale, is held by enchantment in a dark prison—this
  world. He can\n                    be rescued only by being taught the secret of
  his true nature as a\n                    child of light, and through learning thau-\n
  \                       maturgic formulas which will enable him to escape to his\n
  \                   heavenly home.\n                Alienation-reconciliation is
  the central pattern of Saint Paul's\n                    interpretation of salvation.
  In adjusting the Hebraic tradition of a chosen\n                    people to a
  universal religion, however, he necessarily had to make\n                    some
  extremely important changes. The later prophets had begun to\n                    think
  of ultimate redemption in terms of all mankind, not just Israel. Paul\n                    completed
  the trans- formation: all of\n                    the human race are members of
  God's family, and so all human beings\n                    necessarily have be-
  come alienated from their\n                    Father. Obviously, there must have
  sprung up serious faults in basic\n                    human nature which have estranged
  all men, not merely some, from God.\n                    There is a generalized
  malaise in the human experience, alienated as all\n                    men are from
  the source of all truth and values. Paul implies that for the\n                    Jewish
  people the alienation was at least partially cured; addressing\n                    the
  Gentiles, he recalls their desperate situ-\n                    ation before Christ:\n
  \               \n                    \n                        ... remember that
  you were at that time separated from Christ,\n                            alienated
  from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the\n                            covenants
  of promise having no hope and without God in the\n                        world\n
  \                   \n                    \n                        (Ephesians 2:12).\n
  \                   \n                \n                He describes the plight
  of fallen man in terms of what the psychiatrist\n                    would immediately
  recognize as “al-\n                        ienation”:\n                \n                    \n
  \                       And you, who once were estranged and hostile in mind, doing
  evil\n                            deeds, he has now reconciled in his body of flesh
  by his\n                        death,...\n                    \n                    \n
  \                       (Colossians 1:21).\n                    \n                \n
  \               This statement demonstrates that alienation and rec- onciliation
  are always combined in Paul's teaching,\n                    for salvation is reconciliation
  with God. The Father has reunited and\n                    gathered his estranged
  human family, not by revealing the law through\n                    prophets, not
  by sending a teacher to reveal the secret way out of this\n                    evil
  world, but by curing human nature through joining the divine with\n                    the
  human. In the union of the two in Christ's unified personality,\n                    alienation
  has ended. The Christian message, Paul stresses again and again,\n                    is
  that “God through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave\n                    us
  the ministry of reconciliation” (II Corinthians 5:18).\n                    The
  Christian is “reconciled to God.” Thus it would\n                    be illuminating
  to speak of the “alienating sin”\n                    instead of “original sin”
  and of redemption as “reconciliation.”\n                     Whether this emphasis
  would survive in Christianity became the\n                    great issue of the
  first and second centuries.\n                Opposed to such a view of salvation
  was the move-\n                    ment known as “Gnosticism.” Although it took
  a\n                    vast number of forms, this sect essentially continued Manicheism
  with\n                    Christian coloration. The good God, it taught, is not
  the creator and ruler\n                    of the irre- deemably evil world in which\n
  \                   man lives and suffers. Men, however, have a spark of\n                    “light”
  which can enable them to escape. Christ was a\n                    heavenly spirit,
  child of a heavenly spirit; both he and his mother\n                    were human
  only in appearance, having no real bodies. Christ's mission\n                    was
  to reveal the gnosis, the secret wisdom. The\n                    whole thrust is
  that Christ did not join divine and\n                    human personalities. There
  is no recon-\n                        ciliation, here, nor any analogy with human
  experience. Man is\n                    saved by totally rejecting material nature,
  by heroic denial of one side of\n                    his being. It is inter- esting
  to speculate\n                    as to what kind of world we should have if, say,
  the Albigensians of the\n                    Middle Ages, who apparently carried
  on this kind of belief, had\n                    triumphed.\n                In
  the late second century, Saint Irenaeus, in a clas-\n                        sical
  attack on Gnosticism, stated the essence of the great\n                    division
  in Christianity:\n                \n                    \n                        ...
  if we devise another substance of our Lord's Flesh, then will\n                            his
  statement about Reconciliation no longer hang together. For\n                            that
  only is reconciled, which at one time was in enmity. But if\n                            our
  Lord brought with Him flesh of another substance, then no\n                            longer
  was the same thing rec-\n                            onciled to God, which by transgression
  has become hostile.\n                            But now by Man's participation
  of Himself our Lord hath reconciled\n                            him to God the
  Father\n                    \n                    \n                        (Against
  the Heresies, trans. John Keble,\n                            V:14:3).\n                    \n
  \               \n                Irenaeus adds an important idea: that under the
  Mosaic law, Israel was never\n                    truly reconciled with God, but
  was only in a\n                    “servile” state; now God has truly adopted all\n
  \                   mankind, without favoritism, and men once more are his\n                    “sons.”
  Hence they should have both more fear and\n                    love of God; “for
  sons ought to fear more than slaves, and to\n                    have greater love
  towards their Father” (ibid., IV:16:5). This\n                    paradoxical combination
  underlies the conception of Christian liberty, and\n                    it could
  exist only in a relationship of alienation- reconciliation.\n                Saint
  Augustine in the course of his spiritual wan-\n                        derings became
  a Manichean, and he left that sect precisely\n                    because it offered
  no hope of real recon-\n                        ciliation with the Father. He says,
  in a sermon for Christmas,\n                    that God, “... remaining God, was
  made man, so that even as the\n                    Son of man he is rightly calledGod
  with us, not 'God in the one case, man in the\n                    other.'” How
  could Christ, if we believe, with the Gnostics, in\n                    the “crucifixion
  of a phantasm,” abolish036\n                     the “enmity” which man's sins have
  created\n                    between him and God? (Confessions 5:19).\n                Augustine's
  spiritual quest was for a faith that would combine a return to a\n                    reconciliation
  with God, and to a strong sense that the Deity is truly\n                    transcendent
  and omnipotent; hence his struggles to formulate free\n                    will
  in accordance with divine power. So he vehe-\n                        mently opposed
  the Pelagians, who denied that man's nature is\n                    intrinsically
  alienated by sin, and that anyone may, like the prodigal son,\n                    decide
  on his own volition to arise and return to his Father.\n                    Augustine—and
  the mainstream of Christianity after his\n                    time—emphasized the
  one-sidedness of the reconciliation. Only as\n                        om- nipotent
  God reaches out to the\n                    individual soul can reconciliation begin.
  Augustine's Confessions\n                    elo- quently expresses the idea that
  natural\n                    man suffers from naturally incurable psychical unrest
  and distress,\n                    and therefore yearns for something to save him;
  and it expresses the\n                    joy, the sense of repose and contentment
  when his estrangement from his\n                    Father is ended.\n                Augustine,
  following a concept implied in the prophets, describes another\n                    kind
  of alienation. The human family itself, which should live in\n                    harmony
  under the Fatherhood of its God, continues in an in- curable state of estrangement
  within itself.\n                    Believers (the adopted people) and unbelievers,
  even though living and\n                    working side by side, are really in
  deep enmity. This alienation, moreover,\n                    is deceptive. The eye
  of worldly wisdom regards the City of God as\n                    composed simply
  of malcontents, since it is out of sympathy with the ideals\n                    and
  convictions of the “world,” which often professes\n                    good ideals
  and inten- tions. But, of course,\n                    it really is the “world”
  that is alienated from the\n                    source of all goodness. Thus there
  has been a continuing impression that\n                    alienation within society
  is inevitable, and that the righteous are perma- nently estranged from the\n                    “establishment,”
  the domi-\n                    nant powers of the world.\n                Medieval
  scholasticism attempted to bring into a syncretic harmony the many\n                    strains
  of thought that had gone into Christianity. The pattern of alienation- reconciliation
  was\n                    not dropped, but the desire to find precise metaphysical
  formulation for\n                    the experience of salvation greatly reduced
  it in importance. Saint\n                    Thomas Aquinas, for example, defining
  the end in life as—in\n                    Aristotelian terms—pure contemplation,
  envi- sioned something quite different from the recon- ciliation of personalities
  Paul\n                    described. The meta- physical definitions\n                    inevitably
  reduced the impression of immediate relationships between God\n                    and
  man. On the other side, the medieval mystical tradition, with its\n                    goal
  of absorption of the individual soul into the divine, worked against\n                    the
  conception of recon- ciliation, which\n                    implies the continuation
  of the indi\n                    vidual self in all its integrity. Augustine certainly
  would have\n                    wished for a mind at one with God's, but not to
  cease to be Augustine.\n                    Finally, the obsession in popular religion
  with a crudely thaumaturgic\n                        salva- tion—sin being purged
  by\n                    rituals, relics, pardons, etc.—reduced the sense of alienation\n
  \                   and recon- ciliation.\n                Essential to Martin Luther's
  reform was a return to Irenaeus' point: that\n                    man is redeemed
  when he returns to become again, literally, a child of God.\n                    Luther
  puts the point in homely, deliberately nontheological terms,\n                    like
  speeches in a domestic drama:\n                \n                    \n                        Christ
  says: formerly you were my enemies; but now you are friends\n                            because
  I regard you as friends, not because you do many good\n                            things
  to Me.... I die for the sort of friends who have done Me no\n                            good.
  I have just loved them and made them my friends...\n                    \n                    \n
  \                       (Commentary on John 15).\n                    \n                \n
  \               God, like a (medieval) father, plays and sports with his children,\n
  \                   pretending to be enraged with them to test their loyalty. Christ,
  unlike\n                    angels, lived with us, “ate, drank, became angry, prayed,
  became\n                    sad, cried.” And in Luther, as commonly in Christianity,
  there\n                    is an implication, very strong if seldom clearly defined,
  that it is\n                    better for the human soul to have undergone alienation
  with subsequent\n                    reconciliation than it would have been never
  to have been estranged from\n                    God. The joy over the return of
  the prodigal son was greater than that\n                    over the continued faithfulness
  of his brother. In any event, the relation\n                    of a husband and
  wife, or of friends who have been seriously estranged and\n                    then
  reconciled, is very different from what it was at first. The fall\n                    of
  man was a felix culpa, then, in the sense\n                    that a new and perhaps
  deeper relation of God to man has been established,\n                    symbolized
  by the cross. A mys- tique of\n                    alienation has been evident throughout
  the history of Christianity.\n                Thus in Western civilization the condition
  of aliena-\n                        tion has, so to speak, been institutionalized
  in religion. The\n                    expectation that alienation is part of the
  human condition has endured even\n                    when specific Christian belief
  has gone. Romanticism viewed man as\n                        “alien- ated” from\n
  \                   nature. Wordsworth's The Prelude, for ex- ample, tells the story
  of a boy, nurtured by the\n                    divine Spirit of nature, subsequently
  alienated from it by the\n                    temptations and corruptions of civilization,
  and finally reconciled. In one\n                    very important respect, however,
  the tradition has changed it. The\n                    Judeo-Christian reli- gions,
  as we have seen,\n                    closely connected alienation and reconciliation.
  The gloom of the Christian\n                    doctrine of “original sin” is greatly
  lightened by\n                    the idea that this condition is a kind of nightmare
  from which those\n                    who receive grace have awakened. It is the
  dark before the light. Modern\n                    views of man as alienated, however,037\n
  \                    have no such solution of the dilemma. Man appears to be\n                    afflicted
  by this state, but its cause and cure are uncertain. Hence we\n                    have
  lost the paradoxical sense of optimism that accompanied the idea of\n                    alienation
  in Christianity.\n                \n                    \n                        BIBLIOGRAPHY\n

  of the History of IdeasAlienation, in theology, refers to the idea that\n                    the
  relation of the worshippers to God may be analogous to the\n                    alienation,
  or estrangement, between human beings. The word implies that a\n                    close
  relationship of affection, family, friendship, or another close tie\n                    has
  been broken, often with detrimental effects on the psyche. The\n                    disorganization
  of the self, worries about guilt, and loss of identity\n                    which
  the breaking of a long and very close bond between people may\n                    bring
  are all familiar. The idea that man, by his sin and\n                    indifference,
  may similarly alienate himself from a loving Father is a\n                    distinguishing
  feature of the Judaic and Christian religious traditions.The Judaic conception of
  God and his people came increasingly to be of a\n                    familial situation.
  The story of the creation and fall of man stresses the\n                    point
  that Adam and Eve were both disobedient and potentially\n                    dangerous
  to the high God, since they were ambitious of raising themselves\n                    to
  divine status and might find the means of doing so (Genesis 1:22).\n                    Jehovah
  appears as a jealous ruler. But there is a critical change\n                    when
  the Lord adopts Abram as a son, as a child is adopted, giving him\n                    the
  new name Abraham (Genesis 17), just as later, Jacob is renamed Israel.\n                    God
  is thought of\n                     not merely as the familiar protector of a nation,
  but, uniquely\n                    among ancient cults, as the Father of a human
  family—the tribes\n                    of Israel. The paradigm of the fam- ily,
  with its\n                    tensions of affection, hate, loyalties, and fears,
  permeates the Old\n                    Testament. Again and again the children are
  disobedient and become\n                    estranged from their Father: again and
  again, there is recon- ciliation between a sorrowing,\n                    merciful
  but divine parent and his loved, but wayward, family. As in a\n                    human
  family, there is a separation between faithful, appreciative siblings\n                    and
  willful, rebellious ones. Some- times the\n                    children wander off
  to other gods in place of their own Father.The prophets are the agents through whom
  God communicates his love for his\n                    children, his repeated disappointment
  and anger over their behavior, and\n                    his plans for effecting
  a final reconciliation. The prophets do not\n                    merely warn of
  terrible punishments if the chosen people continue to\n                    disobey
  the Lord: they constantly use figures from the patriarchal family\n                    to
  embody their message. In one of the most poignant passages of the\n                    Old
  Testament, Hosea represents the Lord yearning over his people Israel\n                    just
  as a patriarch might speak of his sons:When Israel was a child, I loved him, and
  out of Egypt I called my\n                            son. The more I called them,
  the more they went from me; they kept\n                            sacrificing to
  the Baals, and burn- ing\n                            incense to idols. Yet it was
  I who taught Ephraim to walk, I took\n                            them up in my
  arms; but they did not know that I healed them. I led\n                            them
  with cords of compassion, with the bands of love;... and I\n                            bent
  down to them and fed them.... How can I give you up, O\n                            Ephraim!...
  My heart recoils within me, my compassion grows\n                            warm
  and tender\n                        (Hosea 11:1-8, Revised Standard Version).\n
  \                   Elsewhere, the relationship is that of husband and wife: “And
  in\n                    that day, says the Lord, you will call me, 'My husband,'
  and no longer will\n                    you call me, 'My baal'” (Hosea 2:16).It
  is hard to find anything in other world-religions to compare with this\n                    moving,
  divine domestic drama. Even in Islam, Allah appears as judge and\n                    sustainer
  of order only; man is created to fulfill the amr, the divine commandment. In Neo-Platonism,
  it has been\n                    asserted, there is a form of alienation, for man
  is seen as separated from\n                    his true divine source and home.
  The soul has been corrupted by matter, the\n                    lowest stage of
  the emanations from the One, and so has turned away\n                    from its
  higher origin, the Intellect. The very metaphysical structure and\n                    impersonality
  of this sys- tem, however,\n                    precludes anything like the relationships
  and dynamic tensions among\n                    different psyches which are implied
  in alienation as we have defined it.\n                    The process of return
  to the Intellect, which certainly never yearns\n                    over a lost
  soul, in fact implies something likeAlienation-reconciliation is the central pattern
  of Saint Paul's\n                    interpretation of salvation. In adjusting the
  Hebraic tradition of a chosen\n                    people to a universal religion,
  however, he necessarily had to make\n                    some extremely important
  changes. The later prophets had begun to\n                    think of ultimate
  redemption in terms of all mankind, not just Israel. Paul\n                    completed
  the trans- formation: all of\n                    the human race are members of
  God's family, and so all human beings\n                    necessarily have be-
  come alienated from their\n                    Father. Obviously, there must have
  sprung up serious faults in basic\n                    human nature which have estranged
  all men, not merely some, from God.\n                    There is a generalized
  malaise in the human experience, alienated as all\n                    men are from
  the source of all truth and values. Paul implies that for the\n                    Jewish
  people the alienation was at least partially cured; addressing\n                    the
  Gentiles, he recalls their desperate situ-\n                    ation before Christ:...
  remember that you were at that time separated from Christ,\n                            alienated
  from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the\n                            covenants
  of promise having no hope and without God in the\n                        world\n
  \                       (Ephesians 2:12).\n                    He describes the
  plight of fallen man in terms of what the psychiatrist\n                    would
  immediately recognize as “al-\n                        ienation”:And you, who once
  were estranged and hostile in mind, doing evil\n                            deeds,
  he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his\n                        death,...\n
  \                       (Colossians 1:21).\n                    This statement demonstrates
  that alienation and rec- onciliation are always combined in Paul's teaching,\n                    for
  salvation is reconciliation with God. The Father has reunited and\n                    gathered
  his estranged human family, not by revealing the law through\n                    prophets,
  not by sending a teacher to reveal the secret way out of this\n                    evil
  world, but by curing human nature through joining the divine with\n                    the
  human. In the union of the two in Christ's unified personality,\n                    alienation
  has ended. The Christian message, Paul stresses again and again,\n                    is
  that “God through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave\n                    us
  the ministry of reconciliation” (II Corinthians 5:18).\n                    The
  Christian is “reconciled to God.” Thus it would\n                    be illuminating
  to speak of the “alienating sin”\n                    instead of “original sin”
  and of redemption as “reconciliation.”\n                     Whether this emphasis
  would survive in Christianity became the\n                    great issue of the
  first and second centuries.Opposed to such a view of salvation was the move-\n                    ment
  known as “Gnosticism.” Although it took a\n                    vast number of forms,
  this sect essentially continued Manicheism with\n                    Christian coloration.
  The good God, it taught, is not the creator and ruler\n                    of the
  irre- deemably evil world in which\n                    man lives and suffers. Men,
  however, have a spark of\n                    “light” which can enable them to escape.
  Christ was a\n                    heavenly spirit, child of a heavenly spirit; both
  he and his mother\n                    were human only in appearance, having no
  real bodies. Christ's mission\n                    was to reveal the gnosis, the
  secret wisdom. The\n                    whole thrust is that Christ did not join
  divine and\n                    human personalities. There is no recon-\n                        ciliation,
  here, nor any analogy with human experience. Man is\n                    saved by
  totally rejecting material nature, by heroic denial of one side of\n                    his
  being. It is inter- esting to speculate\n                    as to what kind of
  world we should have if, say, the Albigensians of the\n                    Middle
  Ages, who apparently carried on this kind of belief, had\n                    triumphed.In
  the late second century, Saint Irenaeus, in a clas-\n                        sical
  attack on Gnosticism, stated the essence of the great\n                    division
  in Christianity:... if we devise another substance of our Lord's Flesh, then will\n
  \                           his statement about Reconciliation no longer hang together.
  For\n                            that only is reconciled, which at one time was
  in enmity. But if\n                            our Lord brought with Him flesh of
  another substance, then no\n                            longer was the same thing
  rec-\n                            onciled to God, which by transgression has become
  hostile.\n                            But now by Man's participation of Himself
  our Lord hath reconciled\n                            him to God the Father\n                        (Against
  the Heresies, trans. John Keble,\n                            V:14:3).\n                    Irenaeus
  adds an important idea: that under the Mosaic law, Israel was never\n                    truly
  reconciled with God, but was only in a\n                    “servile” state; now
  God has truly adopted all\n                    mankind, without favoritism, and
  men once more are his\n                    “sons.” Hence they should have both more
  fear and\n                    love of God; “for sons ought to fear more than slaves,
  and to\n                    have greater love towards their Father” (ibid., IV:16:5).
  This\n                    paradoxical combination underlies the conception of Christian
  liberty, and\n                    it could exist only in a relationship of alienation-
  reconciliation.Saint Augustine in the course of his spiritual wan-\n                        derings
  became a Manichean, and he left that sect precisely\n                    because
  it offered no hope of real recon-\n                        ciliation with the Father.
  He says, in a sermon for Christmas,\n                    that God, “... remaining
  God, was made man, so that even as the\n                    Son of man he is rightly
  calledGod with us, not 'God in the one case, man in the\n                    other.'”
  How could Christ, if we believe, with the Gnostics, in\n                    the
  “crucifixion of a phantasm,” abolishAugustine's spiritual quest was for a faith
  that would combine a return to a\n                    reconciliation with God, and
  to a strong sense that the Deity is truly\n                    transcendent and
  omnipotent; hence his struggles to formulate free\n                    will in accordance
  with divine power. So he vehe-\n                        mently opposed the Pelagians,
  who denied that man's nature is\n                    intrinsically alienated by
  sin, and that anyone may, like the prodigal son,\n                    decide on
  his own volition to arise and return to his Father.\n                    Augustine—and
  the mainstream of Christianity after his\n                    time—emphasized the
  one-sidedness of the reconciliation. Only as\n                        om- nipotent
  God reaches out to the\n                    individual soul can reconciliation begin.
  Augustine's Confessions\n                    elo- quently expresses the idea that
  natural\n                    man suffers from naturally incurable psychical unrest
  and distress,\n                    and therefore yearns for something to save him;
  and it expresses the\n                    joy, the sense of repose and contentment
  when his estrangement from his\n                    Father is ended.Augustine, following
  a concept implied in the prophets, describes another\n                    kind of
  alienation. The human family itself, which should live in\n                    harmony
  under the Fatherhood of its God, continues in an in- curable state of estrangement
  within itself.\n                    Believers (the adopted people) and unbelievers,
  even though living and\n                    working side by side, are really in
  deep enmity. This alienation, moreover,\n                    is deceptive. The eye
  of worldly wisdom regards the City of God as\n                    composed simply
  of malcontents, since it is out of sympathy with the ideals\n                    and
  convictions of the “world,” which often professes\n                    good ideals
  and inten- tions. But, of course,\n                    it really is the “world”
  that is alienated from the\n                    source of all goodness. Thus there
  has been a continuing impression that\n                    alienation within society
  is inevitable, and that the righteous are perma- nently estranged from the\n                    “establishment,”
  the domi-\n                    nant powers of the world.Medieval scholasticism attempted
  to bring into a syncretic harmony the many\n                    strains of thought
  that had gone into Christianity. The pattern of alienation- reconciliation was\n
  \                   not dropped, but the desire to find precise metaphysical formulation
  for\n                    the experience of salvation greatly reduced it in importance.
  Saint\n                    Thomas Aquinas, for example, defining the end in life
  as—in\n                    Aristotelian terms—pure contemplation, envi- sioned something
  quite different from the recon- ciliation of personalities Paul\n                    described.
  The meta- physical definitions\n                    inevitably reduced the impression
  of immediate relationships between God\n                    and man. On the other
  side, the medieval mystical tradition, with its\n                    goal of absorption
  of the individual soul into the divine, worked against\n                    the
  conception of recon- ciliation, which\n                    implies the continuation
  of the indi\n                    vidual self in all its integrity. Augustine certainly
  would have\n                    wished for a mind at one with God's, but not to
  cease to be Augustine.\n                    Finally, the obsession in popular religion
  with a crudely thaumaturgic\n                        salva- tion—sin being purged
  by\n                    rituals, relics, pardons, etc.—reduced the sense of alienation\n
  \                   and recon- ciliation.Essential to Martin Luther's reform was
  a return to Irenaeus' point: that\n                    man is redeemed when he returns
  to become again, literally, a child of God.\n                    Luther puts the
  point in homely, deliberately nontheological terms,\n                    like speeches
  in a domestic drama:Christ says: formerly you were my enemies; but now you are friends\n
  \                           because I regard you as friends, not because you do
  many good\n                            things to Me.... I die for the sort of friends
  who have done Me no\n                            good. I have just loved them and
  made them my friends...\n                        (Commentary on John 15).\n                    God,
  like a (medieval) father, plays and sports with his children,\n                    pretending
  to be enraged with them to test their loyalty. Christ, unlike\n                    angels,
  lived with us, “ate, drank, became angry, prayed, became\n                    sad,
  cried.” And in Luther, as commonly in Christianity, there\n                    is
  an implication, very strong if seldom clearly defined, that it is\n                    better
  for the human soul to have undergone alienation with subsequent\n                    reconciliation
  than it would have been never to have been estranged from\n                    God.
  The joy over the return of the prodigal son was greater than that\n                    over
  the continued faithfulness of his brother. In any event, the relation\n                    of
  a husband and wife, or of friends who have been seriously estranged and\n                    then
  reconciled, is very different from what it was at first. The fall\n                    of
  man was a felix culpa, then, in the sense\n                    that a new and perhaps
  deeper relation of God to man has been established,\n                    symbolized
  by the cross. A mys- tique of\n                    alienation has been evident throughout
  the history of Christianity.Thus in Western civilization the condition of aliena-\n
  \                       tion has, so to speak, been institutionalized in religion.
  The\n                    expectation that alienation is part of the human condition
  has endured even\n                    when specific Christian belief has gone. Romanticism
  viewed man as\n                        “alien- ated” from\n                    nature.
  Wordsworth's The Prelude, for ex- ample, tells the story of a boy, nurtured by the\n
  \                   divine Spirit of nature, subsequently alienated from it by the\n
  \                   temptations and corruptions of civilization, and finally reconciled.
  In one\n                    very important respect, however, the tradition has changed
  it. The\n                    Judeo-Christian reli- gions, as we have seen,\n                    closely
  connected alienation and reconciliation. The gloom of the Christian\n                    doctrine
  of “original sin” is greatly lightened by\n                    the idea that this
  condition is a kind of nightmare from which those\n                    who receive
  grace have awakened. It is the dark before the light. Modern\n                    views
  of man as alienated, however,The main bibliographical items for this subject are
