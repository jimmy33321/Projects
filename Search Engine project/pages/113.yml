                                  In the science world, if there is an overwhelming complaint about the media, it is that journalists tend to be too “balanced”–in other words, they give roughly 50-50 time to opposing viewpoints even when one side lacks credibility, as in the creationism-evolution battle.
- |
  In 2004 in Columbia Journalism Review, I did a major article critiquing this problem in science coverage–an article that I guess a lot of people read and liked, since it is still mentioned to me regularly. Recently, in fact, John Fleck emailed to ask why it wasn’t available online–and I decided to do something about that.
- |
  So here it is, “Blinded by Science,” a kind of classic critique of “phony balance” in science coverage:

  BLINDED BY SCIENCE: How ‘Balanced’ Coverage Lets the Scientific Fringe Hijack Reality
- |
  Columbia Journalism Review, Nov/Dec2004, Vol. 43, Issue 4
- |
  On May 22, 2003, the Los Angeles Times printed a front-page story by Scott Gold, its respected Houston bureau chief, about the passage of a law in Texas requiring abortion doctors to warn women that the procedure might cause breast cancer. Virtually no mainstream scientist believes that the so-called ABC link actually exists — only anti-abortion activists do. Accordingly, Gold’s article noted right off the bat that the American Cancer Society discounts the “alleged link” and that anti-abortionists have pushed for “so-called counseling” laws only after failing in their attempts to have abortion banned. Gold also reported that the National Cancer Institute had convened “more than a hundred of the world’s experts” to assess the ABC theory, which they rejected. In comparison to these scientists, Gold noted, the author of the Texas counseling bill — who called the ABC issue “still disputed” — had “a professional background in property management.”
- |
  Gold’s piece was hard-hitting but accurate. The scientific consensus is quite firm that abortion does not cause breast cancer. If reporters want to take science and its conclusions seriously, their reporting should reflect this reality — no matter what antiabortionists say.
- |
  But what happened next illustrates one reason journalists have such a hard time calling it like they see it on science issues. In an internal memo exposed by the Web site LAobserved.com, the Times’s editor, John Carroll, singled out Gold’s story for harsh criticism, claiming it vindicated critics who accuse the paper of liberal bias. Carroll specifically criticized Gold’s “so-called counseling” line (“a phrase that is loaded with derision”) and his “professional background in property management” quip (“seldom will you read a cheaper shot than this”). “The story makes a strong case that the link between abortion and breast cancer is widely discounted among researchers,” Carroll wrote, “but I wondered as I read it whether somewhere there might exist some credible  scientist who believes in it …. Apparently the scientific argument for the anti-abortion side is so absurd that we don’t need to waste our readers’ time with it.”
- |
  Gold declined to comment specifically on Carroll’s memo, except to say that it prompted “a sound and good discussion of the standards that we all take very seriously.” For his part, Carroll — now editing his third newspaper — is hardly so naive as to think journalistic “balance” is synonymous with accuracy. In an interview, he nevertheless defended the memo, observing that “reporters have to make judgments about the validity of ideas” but that “a reporter has to be broad-minded in being open to ideas that aren’t necessarily shared by the crowd he or she happens to be hanging around with.” Carroll adds that in his view, Gold needed to find a credible scientist to defend the ABC claim, rather than merely quoting a legislator and then exposing that individual’s lack of scientific background. “You have an obligation to find a scientist, and if the scientist has something to say, then you can subject the scientist’s views to rigorous examination,” Carroll says.
- |
  The trouble is, the leading proponent of the idea that abortions cause breast cancer, Dr. Joel Brind of Baruch College at the City University of New York, underwent a pro-life religious conversion that left him feeling “compelled to use science for its noblest, life-saving purpose,” as he put it in Physician, a magazine published by a conservative religious group called Focus on the Family. Brind’s dedication to the ABC theory has flown in the face of repeated negative critiques of that theory by his scientific peers. When the National Cancer Institute convened the world’s experts to assess the question in February 2003, Brind was the only dissenter from the group’s conclusions.
- |
  Nevertheless, a later article by Gold suggests he may have taken Carroll’s lesson to heart (though Gold says the piece “certainly wasn’t a direct response, or an attempt to change anything or compensate” following Carroll’s memo). On November 6, 2003, Gold reported on a push in Texas to revise the way biology textbooks teach the scientific theory of evolution, which some religious conservatives don’t accept. Gold opened with a glowing profile of one William Dembski, described as a “scientist by trade” but “an evangelical Christian at heart who is convinced that some biological mechanisms are too complex to have been created without divine guidance.” But according to his Web site, Dembski is a philosopher and mathematician, not a biologist. Moreover, he’s a leader of the new “intelligent design” crusade against Darwin’s theory, an updated form of creationism that evolutionary biologists have broadly denounced. (He recently took a job running the Center for Science and Theology at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.) The American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world’s largest scientific society and publisher of Science, the highest-circulation general scientific journal, has firmly stated that proponents have “failed to offer credible scientific evidence to support their claim” that the intelligent design theory “undermines the current scientifically accepted theory of evolution.”
- |
  Scott Gold had it exactly right on abortion and breast cancer. Then he produced an article on “intelligent design” so artificially “balanced” it was downright inaccurate and misleading.

  The basic notion that journalists should go beyond mere “balance” in search of the actual truth hardly represents a novel insight. This magazine, along with its political Web site, Campaign Desk, has been part of a rising chorus against a prevalent but lazy form of journalism that makes no attempt to dig beneath competing claims. But for journalists raised on objectivity and tempered by accusations of bias, knowing that phony balance can create distortion is one thing and taking steps to fix the reporting is another.
- |
  Political reporting hardly presents the only challenge for journalists seeking to go beyond he said/she said accounts, or even the most difficult one. Instead, that distinction may be reserved for media coverage of contested scientific issues, many of them with major policy ramifications, such as global climate change. After all, the journalistic norm of balance has no corollary in the world of science. On the contrary, scientific theories and interpretations survive or perish depending upon whether they’re published in highly competitive journals that practice strict quality control, whether the results upon which they’re based can be replicated by other scientists, and ultimately whether they win over scientific peers. When consensus builds, it is based on repeated testing and retesting of an idea.
- |
  Journalists face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole. First, reporters must often deal with editors who reflexively cry out for “balance.” Meanwhile, determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate requires considerable expertise on the issue at hand. Few journalists have real scientific knowledge, and even beat reporters who know a great deal about certain scientific issues may know little about other ones they’re suddenly asked to cover.
- |
  Moreover, the question of how to substitute accuracy for mere “balance” in science reporting has become ever more pointed as journalists have struggled to cover the Bush administration, which scientists have widely accused of scientific distortions. As the Union of Concerned Scientists, an alliance of citizens and scientists, and other critics have noted, Bush administration statements and actions have often given privileged status to a fringe scientific view over a well-documented, extremely robust mainstream conclusion. Journalists have thus had to decide whether to report on a he said/she said battle between scientists and the White House — which has had very few scientific defenders — or get to the bottom of each case of alleged distortion and report on who’s actually right.
- |
  No wonder scientists have often denounced the press for giving credibility to fringe scientific viewpoints. And without a doubt, the topic on which scientists have most vehemently decried both the media and the Bush administration is global warming. While some scientific uncertainty remains in the climate field, the most rigorous peer-reviewed assessments — produced roughly every five years by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) — have cemented a consensus view that human greenhouse gas emissions are probably (i.e., the conclusion has a fairly high degree of scientific certainty) helping to fuel the greenhouse effect and explain the observed planetary warming of the past fifty years. Yet the Bush administration has consistently sought to undermine this position by hyping lingering uncertainties and seeking to revise government scientific reports. It has also relied upon energy interests and a small cadre of dissenting scientists (some of whom are funded, in part, by industry) in formulating climate policy.
- |
  The centrality of the climate change issue to the scientific critique of the press does not arise by accident. Climate change has mind-bogglingly massive ramifications, not only for the future of our carbon-based economy but for the planet itself. Energy interests wishing to stave off action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have a documented history of supporting the small group of scientists who question the human role in causing climate change — as well as consciously strategizing about how to sow confusion on the issue and sway journalists.
- |
  In 1998, for instance, John H. Cushman, Jr., of The New York Times exposed an internal American Petroleum Institute memo outlining a strategy to invest millions to “maximize the impact of scientific views consistent with ours with Congress, the media and other key audiences.” Perhaps most startling, the memo cited a need to “recruit and train” scientists “who do not have a long history of visibility and/or participation in the climate change debate” to participate in media outreach and counter the mainstream scientific view. This seems to signal an awareness that after a while, journalists catch on to the connections between contrarian scientists and industry. But in the meantime, a window of opportunity apparently exists when reporters can be duped by fresh faces.
- |
  “There’s a very small set of people” who question the consensus, says Science’s executive editor-in-chief, Donald Kennedy. “And there are a great many thoughtful reporters in the media who believe that in order to produce a balanced story, you’ve got to pick one commentator from side A and one commentator from side B. I call it the two-card Rolodex problem.”
- |
  The Stanford climatologist Stephen Schneider echoes this concern. A scientist whose interactions with the media on the subject of climate change span decades, Schneider has reflected at length on the subject, especially in his 1989 book Global Warming. Schneider’s climate-change Web site also devotes a section to what he calls “Mediarology,” where he notes that in science debates “there are rarely just two polar opposite sides, but rather a spectrum of potential outcomes, oftentimes accompanied by a considerable history of scientific assessment of the relative credibility of these many possibilities. A climate scientist faced with a reporter locked into the ‘get both sides’ mindset risks getting his or her views stuffed into one of two boxed storylines: ‘we’re worried’ or ‘it will all be okay.’ And sometimes, these two ‘boxes’ are misrepresentative; a mainstream, well-established consensus may be ‘balanced’ against the opposing views of a few extremists, and to the uninformed, each position seems equally credible.”
- |
  Academics have studied media coverage of climate change, and the results confirm climate scientists’ longstanding complaints. In a recent paper published in the journal Global Environmental Change, the scholars Maxwell T. Boykoff and Jules M. Boykoff analyzed coverage of the issue in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and the Los Angeles Times between 1988 and 2002. During this fourteen-year period, climate scientists successfully forged a powerful consensus on human-caused climate change. But reporting in these four major papers did not at all reflect this consensus.
- |
  The Boykoffs analyzed a random sample of 636 articles. They found that a majority — 52.7 percent — gave “roughly equal attention” to the scientific consensus view that humans contribute to climate change and to the energy-industry-supported view that natural fluctuations suffice to explain the observed warming. By comparison, just 35.3 percent of articles emphasized the scientific consensus view while still presenting the other side in a subordinate fashion. Finally, 6.2 percent emphasized the industry-supported view, and a mere 5.9 percent focused on the consensus view without bothering to provide the industry/skeptic counterpoint.
- |
  Most intriguing, the Boykoffs’ study found a shift in coverage between 1988 — when climate change first garnered wide media coverage — and 1990. During that period, journalists broadly moved from focusing on scientists’ views of climate change to providing “balanced” accounts. During this same period, the Boykoffs noted, climate change became highly politicized and a “small group of influential spokespeople and scientists emerged in the news” to question the mainstream view that industrial emissions are warming the planet. The authors conclude that the U.S. “prestige-press” has produced “informationally biased coverage of global warming … hidden behind the veil of journalistic balance.”
- |
  In a rich irony, a UPI report on August 30, 2004, about the Boykoffs’ study covered it in — that’s right — a thoroughly “balanced” fashion. The article gave considerable space to the viewpoint of Frank Maisano, a former spokesman for the industry-sponsored Global Climate Coalition and a professional media consultant, who called the Boykoffs’ contentions “absolutely outrageous” and proceeded to reiterate many of the dubious criticisms of mainstream climate science for which the “skeptic” camp is so notorious. In the process, the UPI piece epitomized all the pathologies of U.S. coverage of climate change — pathologies that aren’t generally recapitulated abroad. Media research suggests that U.S. journalists cover climate change very differently from their European counterparts, often lending much more credence to the viewpoints of “skeptics” like Maisano.
- |
  In an interview, Maxwell Boykoff — an environmental studies Ph.D. candidate at the University of California at Santa Cruz — noted that if there’s one American journalist who cuts against the grain in covering the climate issue, it’s Andrew C. Revkin of The New York Times. That’s revealing, because Revkin happens to be the only reporter at any of the major newspapers studied who covers “global environmental change” as his exclusive beat, which Revkin says means writing about climate change “close to half” of the time. Revkin has also been covering global warming since 1988 and has written a book on the topic. (This fall he began teaching environmental reporting as an adjunct at Columbia’s Graduate School of Journalism.)
- |
  Revkin agrees with the basic thrust of the Boykoff study, but he also notes that the analysis focuses only on the quantitative aspect of climate-change coverage, rather than more subtle qualitative questions such as how reporters “characterize the voices” of the people they quote.
- |
  After all, the issue isn’t just how many column inches journalists give to the perspective of climate-change “skeptics” versus the mainstream view. It’s also how they identify these contrarian figures, many of whom have industry ties. Take a January 8, 2004, article by The Washington Post’s Guy Gugliotta, reporting on a study in the journal Nature finding that global warming could “drive 15 to 37 percent of living species toward extinction by mid-century.” Gugliotta’s story hardly suffered from phony balance. But when it did include a “skeptic” perspective — in a thoroughly subordinate fashion in the ninth paragraph — the skeptic’s industry ties went unmentioned:
- |
  One skeptic, William O’Keefe, president of the George C. Marshall Institute, a conservative science policy organization, criticized the Nature study, saying that the research ‘ignored species’ ability to adapt to higher temperatures’ and assumed that technologies will not arise to reduce emissions.
- |
  What Gugliotta didn’t say is this: the Marshall Institute receives substantial support from oil giant ExxonMobil, a leading funder of think tanks, frequently conservative in orientation, that question the scientific consensus on climate change. Moreover, O’Keefe himself has chaired the anti-Kyoto Protocol Global Climate Coalition, and served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of the American Petroleum Institute. Senate documents from 2001 through 2003 also list him as a registered lobbyist for ExxonMobil. (To be fair, when I discussed this matter with O’Keefe while working on a previous article, he said that he registers as a lobbyist “out of an abundance of caution” and keeps his ExxonMobil and Marshall Institute work “separate.”)
- |
  Asked about all of this, Gugliotta said he simply didn’t know of O’Keefe’s industry connections at the time. He said he considered O’Keefe a “reasoned skeptic” who provided a measured perspective from the other side of the issue. Fair enough. His industry ties don’t necessarily detract from that, but readers still should know about them.
- |
  The point isn’t to single out Gugliotta — any number of other examples could be found. And such omissions don’t merely occur on the news pages. Some major op-ed pages also appear to think that to fulfill their duty of providing a range of views, they should publish dubious contrarian opinion pieces on climate change even when those pieces are written by nonscientists. For instance, on July 7, 2003, The Washington Post published a revisionist op-ed on climate science by James Schlesinger, a former secretary of both energy and defense, and a former director of Central Intelligence. “In recent years the inclination has been to attribute the warming we have lately experienced to a single dominant cause — the increase in greenhouse gases,” wrote Schlesinger. “Yet climate has always been changing — and sometimes the swings have been rapid.” The clear implication was that scientists don’t know enough about the causes of climate change to justify strong pollution controls.
- |
  That’s not how most climatologists feel, but then Schlesinger is an economist by training, not a climatologist. Moreover, his Washington Post byline failed to note that he sits on the board of directors of Peabody Energy, the largest coal company in the world, and has since 2001. Peabody has resisted the push for mandatory controls on greenhouse gas emissions, such as those that would be required by the Kyoto Protocol. In a 2001 speech, the Peabody executive John Wootten argued that “there remains great uncertainty in the scientific understanding of climate,” and that “imposition of immediate constraints on emissions from fossil-fuel use is not warranted.”
- |
  Funny, that’s pretty much what Schlesinger argued.
- |

  For another group of scientists, the grievances with the press have emerged more recently, but arguably with far greater force. That’s because on an issue of great concern to these scientists — the various uses and abuses of somatic cell nuclear transfer, or cloning — journalists have swallowed the claims of the scientific fringe hook, line, and sinker.
- |
  Consider the great 2002 cloning hoax. In the media lull following Christmas, one Brigitte Boisselier — the “scientific director” of Clonaid, a company linked to the UFO-obsessed Raelian sect, and already a semi-celebrity who had been profiled in The New York Times Magazine — announced the birth of the world’s first cloned baby. At her press conference, covered live by CNN, MSNBC, and Fox, Boisselier could not even produce a picture of the alleged child — “Eve” — much less independent scientific verification of her claims. She instead promised proof within eight or nine days. Needless to say, the whole affair should have made the press wary.
- |
  Nevertheless, a media frenzy ensued, with journalists occasionally mocking and questioning the Raelians while allowing their claims to drive the coverage. CNN’s medical correspondent, Sanjay Gupta, provided a case in point. When he interviewed Boisselier following her press conference, Gupta called Clonaid a group with “the capacity to clone” and told Boisselier, credulously, “We are certainly going to be anxiously awaiting to see some of the proof from these independent scientists next week.”
- |
  Perhaps most outspoken in criticizing the press during the Clonaid fiasco was Arthur Caplan, the University of Pennsylvania biomedical ethicist. As one of the nation’s most quoted bioethicists, Caplan had the advantage of actual access to the media during the feeding frenzy. Yet that familiarity made little difference. As Caplan complained in an MSNBC.com column following the Raelians’ announcement, no one wanted to listen to his skepticism because that would have required dropping the story: “As soon as I heard about the Raelians’ cloning claim, I knew it was nonsense,” wrote Caplan. “The media have shown themselves incapable of covering the key social and intellectual phenomena of the 21st century, namely the revolution in genetics and biology.”
- |
  Caplan observed that Clonaid had no scientific peer-reviewed publications to prove its techniques were up to snuff, and that cloning had barely worked in live animal species, and then only after countless initial failures. Nevertheless, Clonaid had implausibly claimed a stunning success rate — five pregnancies in ten attempts — in its experiments.
- |
  The Clonaid fiasco shows the media at their absolute worst in covering scientific issues. Reviewing the coverage two years later is a painful exercise. As even Gupta later admitted, “I think if we had known … that there was going to be no proof at this press conference, I think that we probably would have pulled the plug.” Later on, even the Raelians themselves reportedly laughed at how easy it was to get free publicity.
- |
  But this wasn’t just fun and games. The political consequences of the press’s cloning coverage were considerable. Widespread fear of human cloning inevitably lends strength to sweeping legislation that would ban all forms of cloning, despite the fact that many scientists think the cloning of embryos for research purposes holds significant medical promise; it would allow for the creation of embryonic-stem-cell lines genetically matched to individual patients. Thus, on an issue where one side of the debate thrives on fear, the media delivered exactly what these cloning-ban advocates desired. Where the press’s unjustifiable addiction to “balance” on climate change produces a political stalemate on a pressing issue of global consequence, its addiction to cloning cranks provided a potent political weapon to the enemies of crucial research.
- |
  None of those examples of poorly “balanced” science reporting arise from precisely the same set of journalistic shortcomings. In Scott Gold’s case at the Los Angeles Times, he appears to have known the scientific issues perfectly well. That gave his writing an authority that set off warning bells in an editor wary of bias. That’s very different from the Clonaid example, where sheer credulousness among members of the media — combined with sensationalism and a slow news period — were the problem. And that’s different still from the problem of false balance in the media coverage of climate change in the U.S., which has been chronic for more than a decade.
- |
  Yet in each case, the basic journalistic remedy would probably be the same. As a general rule, journalists should treat fringe scientific claims with considerable skepticism, and find out what major peer-reviewed papers or assessments have to say about them. Moreover, they should adhere to the principle that the more outlandish or dramatic the claim, the more skepticism it warrants. The Los Angeles Times’s Carroll observes that “every good journalist has a bit of a contrarian in his soul,” but it is precisely this impulse that can lead reporters astray. The fact is, nonscientist journalists can all too easily fall for scientific-sounding claims that they can’t adequately evaluate on their own.
- |
  That doesn’t mean that scientific consensus is right in every instance. There are famous examples, in fact, of when it was proved wrong: Galileo comes to mind, as does a lowly patent clerk named Einstein. In the vast majority of modern cases, however, scientific consensus can be expected to hold up under scrutiny precisely because it was reached through a lengthy and rigorous process of professional skepticism and criticism. At the very least, journalists covering science-based policy debates should familiarize themselves with this professional proving ground, learn what it says about the relative merits of competing claims, and “balance” their reports accordingly.

- |
  At the very least that will probably mean requiring every journalism and communication’s major to take a course in science writing.
- |
  Is this more or less practical than having scientist learn better communication skills? I’d say more practical because, in my experience, when you compare the course-load and amount of work required of journalism majors, it pales in comparison to most science majors, especially the “hard” sciences.
- |
  Ideally we’d do both, of course.

  are basically asking them to accept scientists as an authority they are unable to
  check or question (as they won’t understand the answers). And as journalists don’t
  have the scientific education to be able to list the reasons why science is different,
  they treat scientists in the same way as any other self-claimed authority figure.
  It is *their job* to challenge the statements of politicians, businessmen, and campaigners
  for this cause or that.\n"

  Plus of course the role of journalists is not to educate, but to sell more newspapers, and controversy does that.

  fired after the next quarterly balance is published. If his board of directors didn’t

  much about it – it isn’t their fault and if they buck the trend, they are much,

- |
  If you want to change things, start hitting newspapers with serious financial penalties for reporting unsubstantiated crap as if it was fact. Paradoxically, this may be what is required to save this industry; they will never beat the Internet as a source of entertaining sound bites (kittens!), but may survive as a source of reliable news.

  You’d think the stockholders/owners would notice they are poisoning their own gold-laying goose, but in the current system, this year (or quarter) results are all that matter.

  they’re also likely to be less biased.  This may seem counterintuitive but there
  are two reasons for this: (1) senior scientists, especially prominent ones, may
  have their whole scientific identity tied up in the success of one of their theories
  whereas grad students and post docs are rarely as invested, and (2) someone with
  an uncertain career ahead is more likely to take a middle course, to maintain respect
  from all sides who will define his career. A grad student earns respect in the scientific
  arena not only for his/her research, but also for showing independence and an incisive
  view of what is at the heart of a dispute. Good grad students strive for this.\n"
- |
  This must be done carefully, of course, but the fresh perspective of the grad student just might be the one that knows where the “balance” is.

  Some scientists have questioned how the IPCC could have allowed such a mistake into print. Perhaps the most likely reason was lack of expertise. Lal himself admits he knows little about glaciers. “I am not an expert on glaciers.and I have not visited the region so I have to rely on credible published research. The comments in the WWF report were made by a respected Indian scientist and it was reasonable to assume he knew what he was talking about,” he said.

  Two years ago, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN agency which evaluates the risk from global warming, warned the glaciers were receding faster than in any other part of the world and could “disappear altogether by 2035 if not sooner”.
- |
  Today Ramesh denied any such risk existed: “There is no conclusive scientific evidence to link global warming with what is happening in the Himalayan glaciers.” The minister added although some glaciers are receding they were doing so at a rate that was not “historically alarming”.

  Does the IPCC represent the consensus view of climate science or is it simply a propaganda outlet? And how many more phony claims are in IPCC reports that have not been verified by science?

  ” The panel, which relies on contributions from hundreds of scientists, is considering whether to amend the estimate or remove it. ”
- |
  “The flawed estimate raises more questions about the panel’s vetting procedures than it does about the melting of Himalayan glaciers, which most scientists believe is a major problem.”

          In the science world, if there is an overwhelming complaint about the media, it is that journalists tend to be too “balanced”–in other words, they give roughly 50-50 time to opposing viewpoints even when one side lacks credibility, as in the creationism-evolution battle.In 2004 in Columbia Journalism Review, I did a major article critiquing this problem in science coverage–an article that I guess a lot of people read and liked, since it is still mentioned to me regularly. Recently, in fact, John Fleck emailed to ask why it wasn’t available online–and I decided to do something about that.So here it is, “Blinded by Science,” a kind of classic critique of “phony balance” in science coverage:BLINDED BY SCIENCE: How ‘Balanced’ Coverage Lets the Scientific Fringe Hijack RealityColumbia Journalism Review, Nov/Dec2004, Vol. 43, Issue 4On May 22, 2003, the Los Angeles Times printed a front-page story by Scott Gold, its respected Houston bureau chief, about the passage of a law in Texas requiring abortion doctors to warn women that the procedure might cause breast cancer. Virtually no mainstream scientist believes that the so-called ABC link actually exists — only anti-abortion activists do. Accordingly, Gold’s article noted right off the bat that the American Cancer Society discounts the “alleged link” and that anti-abortionists have pushed for “so-called counseling” laws only after failing in their attempts to have abortion banned. Gold also reported that the National Cancer Institute had convened “more than a hundred of the world’s experts” to assess the ABC theory, which they rejected. In comparison to these scientists, Gold noted, the author of the Texas counseling bill — who called the ABC issue “still disputed” — had “a professional background in property management.”Gold’s piece was hard-hitting but accurate. The scientific consensus is quite firm that abortion does not cause breast cancer. If reporters want to take science and its conclusions seriously, their reporting should reflect this reality — no matter what antiabortionists say.But what happened next illustrates one reason journalists have such a hard time calling it like they see it on science issues. In an internal memo exposed by the Web site LAobserved.com, the Times’s editor, John Carroll, singled out Gold’s story for harsh criticism, claiming it vindicated critics who accuse the paper of liberal bias. Carroll specifically criticized Gold’s “so-called counseling” line (“a phrase that is loaded with derision”) and his “professional background in property management” quip (“seldom will you read a cheaper shot than this”). “The story makes a strong case that the link between abortion and breast cancer is widely discounted among researchers,” Carroll wrote, “but I wondered as I read it whether somewhere there might exist some credible  scientist who believes in it …. Apparently the scientific argument for the anti-abortion side is so absurd that we don’t need to waste our readers’ time with it.”Gold declined to comment specifically on Carroll’s memo, except to say that it prompted “a sound and good discussion of the standards that we all take very seriously.” For his part, Carroll — now editing his third newspaper — is hardly so naive as to think journalistic “balance” is synonymous with accuracy. In an interview, he nevertheless defended the memo, observing that “reporters have to make judgments about the validity of ideas” but that “a reporter has to be broad-minded in being open to ideas that aren’t necessarily shared by the crowd he or she happens to be hanging around with.” Carroll adds that in his view, Gold needed to find a credible scientist to defend the ABC claim, rather than merely quoting a legislator and then exposing that individual’s lack of scientific background. “You have an obligation to find a scientist, and if the scientist has something to say, then you can subject the scientist’s views to rigorous examination,” Carroll says.The trouble is, the leading proponent of the idea that abortions cause breast cancer, Dr. Joel Brind of Baruch College at the City University of New York, underwent a pro-life religious conversion that left him feeling “compelled to use science for its noblest, life-saving purpose,” as he put it in Physician, a magazine published by a conservative religious group called Focus on the Family. Brind’s dedication to the ABC theory has flown in the face of repeated negative critiques of that theory by his scientific peers. When the National Cancer Institute convened the world’s experts to assess the question in February 2003, Brind was the only dissenter from the group’s conclusions.Nevertheless, a later article by Gold suggests he may have taken Carroll’s lesson to heart (though Gold says the piece “certainly wasn’t a direct response, or an attempt to change anything or compensate” following Carroll’s memo). On November 6, 2003, Gold reported on a push in Texas to revise the way biology textbooks teach the scientific theory of evolution, which some religious conservatives don’t accept. Gold opened with a glowing profile of one William Dembski, described as a “scientist by trade” but “an evangelical Christian at heart who is convinced that some biological mechanisms are too complex to have been created without divine guidance.” But according to his Web site, Dembski is a philosopher and mathematician, not a biologist. Moreover, he’s a leader of the new “intelligent design” crusade against Darwin’s theory, an updated form of creationism that evolutionary biologists have broadly denounced. (He recently took a job running the Center for Science and Theology at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.) The American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world’s largest scientific society and publisher of Science, the highest-circulation general scientific journal, has firmly stated that proponents have “failed to offer credible scientific evidence to support their claim” that the intelligent design theory “undermines the current scientifically accepted theory of evolution.”Scott Gold had it exactly right on abortion and breast cancer. Then he produced an article on “intelligent design” so artificially “balanced” it was downright inaccurate and misleading.* * * * *The basic notion that journalists should go beyond mere “balance” in search of the actual truth hardly represents a novel insight. This magazine, along with its political Web site, Campaign Desk, has been part of a rising chorus against a prevalent but lazy form of journalism that makes no attempt to dig beneath competing claims. But for journalists raised on objectivity and tempered by accusations of bias, knowing that phony balance can create distortion is one thing and taking steps to fix the reporting is another.Political reporting hardly presents the only challenge for journalists seeking to go beyond he said/she said accounts, or even the most difficult one. Instead, that distinction may be reserved for media coverage of contested scientific issues, many of them with major policy ramifications, such as global climate change. After all, the journalistic norm of balance has no corollary in the world of science. On the contrary, scientific theories and interpretations survive or perish depending upon whether they’re published in highly competitive journals that practice strict quality control, whether the results upon which they’re based can be replicated by other scientists, and ultimately whether they win over scientific peers. When consensus builds, it is based on repeated testing and retesting of an idea.Journalists face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole. First, reporters must often deal with editors who reflexively cry out for “balance.” Meanwhile, determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate requires considerable expertise on the issue at hand. Few journalists have real scientific knowledge, and even beat reporters who know a great deal about certain scientific issues may know little about other ones they’re suddenly asked to cover.Moreover, the question of how to substitute accuracy for mere “balance” in science reporting has become ever more pointed as journalists have struggled to cover the Bush administration, which scientists have widely accused of scientific distortions. As the Union of Concerned Scientists, an alliance of citizens and scientists, and other critics have noted, Bush administration statements and actions have often given privileged status to a fringe scientific view over a well-documented, extremely robust mainstream conclusion. Journalists have thus had to decide whether to report on a he said/she said battle between scientists and the White House — which has had very few scientific defenders — or get to the bottom of each case of alleged distortion and report on who’s actually right.No wonder scientists have often denounced the press for giving credibility to fringe scientific viewpoints. And without a doubt, the topic on which scientists have most vehemently decried both the media and the Bush administration is global warming. While some scientific uncertainty remains in the climate field, the most rigorous peer-reviewed assessments — produced roughly every five years by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) — have cemented a consensus view that human greenhouse gas emissions are probably (i.e., the conclusion has a fairly high degree of scientific certainty) helping to fuel the greenhouse effect and explain the observed planetary warming of the past fifty years. Yet the Bush administration has consistently sought to undermine this position by hyping lingering uncertainties and seeking to revise government scientific reports. It has also relied upon energy interests and a small cadre of dissenting scientists (some of whom are funded, in part, by industry) in formulating climate policy.The centrality of the climate change issue to the scientific critique of the press does not arise by accident. Climate change has mind-bogglingly massive ramifications, not only for the future of our carbon-based economy but for the planet itself. Energy interests wishing to stave off action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have a documented history of supporting the small group of scientists who question the human role in causing climate change — as well as consciously strategizing about how to sow confusion on the issue and sway journalists.In 1998, for instance, John H. Cushman, Jr., of The New York Times exposed an internal American Petroleum Institute memo outlining a strategy to invest millions to “maximize the impact of scientific views consistent with ours with Congress, the media and other key audiences.” Perhaps most startling, the memo cited a need to “recruit and train” scientists “who do not have a long history of visibility and/or participation in the climate change debate” to participate in media outreach and counter the mainstream scientific view. This seems to signal an awareness that after a while, journalists catch on to the connections between contrarian scientists and industry. But in the meantime, a window of opportunity apparently exists when reporters can be duped by fresh faces.“There’s a very small set of people” who question the consensus, says Science’s executive editor-in-chief, Donald Kennedy. “And there are a great many thoughtful reporters in the media who believe that in order to produce a balanced story, you’ve got to pick one commentator from side A and one commentator from side B. I call it the two-card Rolodex problem.”The Stanford climatologist Stephen Schneider echoes this concern. A scientist whose interactions with the media on the subject of climate change span decades, Schneider has reflected at length on the subject, especially in his 1989 book Global Warming. Schneider’s climate-change Web site also devotes a section to what he calls “Mediarology,” where he notes that in science debates “there are rarely just two polar opposite sides, but rather a spectrum of potential outcomes, oftentimes accompanied by a considerable history of scientific assessment of the relative credibility of these many possibilities. A climate scientist faced with a reporter locked into the ‘get both sides’ mindset risks getting his or her views stuffed into one of two boxed storylines: ‘we’re worried’ or ‘it will all be okay.’ And sometimes, these two ‘boxes’ are misrepresentative; a mainstream, well-established consensus may be ‘balanced’ against the opposing views of a few extremists, and to the uninformed, each position seems equally credible.”Academics have studied media coverage of climate change, and the results confirm climate scientists’ longstanding complaints. In a recent paper published in the journal Global Environmental Change, the scholars Maxwell T. Boykoff and Jules M. Boykoff analyzed coverage of the issue in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and the Los Angeles Times between 1988 and 2002. During this fourteen-year period, climate scientists successfully forged a powerful consensus on human-caused climate change. But reporting in these four major papers did not at all reflect this consensus.The Boykoffs analyzed a random sample of 636 articles. They found that a majority — 52.7 percent — gave “roughly equal attention” to the scientific consensus view that humans contribute to climate change and to the energy-industry-supported view that natural fluctuations suffice to explain the observed warming. By comparison, just 35.3 percent of articles emphasized the scientific consensus view while still presenting the other side in a subordinate fashion. Finally, 6.2 percent emphasized the industry-supported view, and a mere 5.9 percent focused on the consensus view without bothering to provide the industry/skeptic counterpoint.Most intriguing, the Boykoffs’ study found a shift in coverage between 1988 — when climate change first garnered wide media coverage — and 1990. During that period, journalists broadly moved from focusing on scientists’ views of climate change to providing “balanced” accounts. During this same period, the Boykoffs noted, climate change became highly politicized and a “small group of influential spokespeople and scientists emerged in the news” to question the mainstream view that industrial emissions are warming the planet. The authors conclude that the U.S. “prestige-press” has produced “informationally biased coverage of global warming … hidden behind the veil of journalistic balance.”In a rich irony, a UPI report on August 30, 2004, about the Boykoffs’ study covered it in — that’s right — a thoroughly “balanced” fashion. The article gave considerable space to the viewpoint of Frank Maisano, a former spokesman for the industry-sponsored Global Climate Coalition and a professional media consultant, who called the Boykoffs’ contentions “absolutely outrageous” and proceeded to reiterate many of the dubious criticisms of mainstream climate science for which the “skeptic” camp is so notorious. In the process, the UPI piece epitomized all the pathologies of U.S. coverage of climate change — pathologies that aren’t generally recapitulated abroad. Media research suggests that U.S. journalists cover climate change very differently from their European counterparts, often lending much more credence to the viewpoints of “skeptics” like Maisano.In an interview, Maxwell Boykoff — an environmental studies Ph.D. candidate at the University of California at Santa Cruz — noted that if there’s one American journalist who cuts against the grain in covering the climate issue, it’s Andrew C. Revkin of The New York Times. That’s revealing, because Revkin happens to be the only reporter at any of the major newspapers studied who covers “global environmental change” as his exclusive beat, which Revkin says means writing about climate change “close to half” of the time. Revkin has also been covering global warming since 1988 and has written a book on the topic. (This fall he began teaching environmental reporting as an adjunct at Columbia’s Graduate School of Journalism.)Revkin agrees with the basic thrust of the Boykoff study, but he also notes that the analysis focuses only on the quantitative aspect of climate-change coverage, rather than more subtle qualitative questions such as how reporters “characterize the voices” of the people they quote.After all, the issue isn’t just how many column inches journalists give to the perspective of climate-change “skeptics” versus the mainstream view. It’s also how they identify these contrarian figures, many of whom have industry ties. Take a January 8, 2004, article by The Washington Post’s Guy Gugliotta, reporting on a study in the journal Nature finding that global warming could “drive 15 to 37 percent of living species toward extinction by mid-century.” Gugliotta’s story hardly suffered from phony balance. But when it did include a “skeptic” perspective — in a thoroughly subordinate fashion in the ninth paragraph — the skeptic’s industry ties went unmentioned:One skeptic, William O’Keefe, president of the George C. Marshall Institute, a conservative science policy organization, criticized the Nature study, saying that the research ‘ignored species’ ability to adapt to higher temperatures’ and assumed that technologies will not arise to reduce emissions.What Gugliotta didn’t say is this: the Marshall Institute receives substantial support from oil giant ExxonMobil, a leading funder of think tanks, frequently conservative in orientation, that question the scientific consensus on climate change. Moreover, O’Keefe himself has chaired the anti-Kyoto Protocol Global Climate Coalition, and served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of the American Petroleum Institute. Senate documents from 2001 through 2003 also list him as a registered lobbyist for ExxonMobil. (To be fair, when I discussed this matter with O’Keefe while working on a previous article, he said that he registers as a lobbyist “out of an abundance of caution” and keeps his ExxonMobil and Marshall Institute work “separate.”)Asked about all of this, Gugliotta said he simply didn’t know of O’Keefe’s industry connections at the time. He said he considered O’Keefe a “reasoned skeptic” who provided a measured perspective from the other side of the issue. Fair enough. His industry ties don’t necessarily detract from that, but readers still should know about them.The point isn’t to single out Gugliotta — any number of other examples could be found. And such omissions don’t merely occur on the news pages. Some major op-ed pages also appear to think that to fulfill their duty of providing a range of views, they should publish dubious contrarian opinion pieces on climate change even when those pieces are written by nonscientists. For instance, on July 7, 2003, The Washington Post published a revisionist op-ed on climate science by James Schlesinger, a former secretary of both energy and defense, and a former director of Central Intelligence. “In recent years the inclination has been to attribute the warming we have lately experienced to a single dominant cause — the increase in greenhouse gases,” wrote Schlesinger. “Yet climate has always been changing — and sometimes the swings have been rapid.” The clear implication was that scientists don’t know enough about the causes of climate change to justify strong pollution controls.That’s not how most climatologists feel, but then Schlesinger is an economist by training, not a climatologist. Moreover, his Washington Post byline failed to note that he sits on the board of directors of Peabody Energy, the largest coal company in the world, and has since 2001. Peabody has resisted the push for mandatory controls on greenhouse gas emissions, such as those that would be required by the Kyoto Protocol. In a 2001 speech, the Peabody executive John Wootten argued that “there remains great uncertainty in the scientific understanding of climate,” and that “imposition of immediate constraints on emissions from fossil-fuel use is not warranted.”Funny, that’s pretty much what Schlesinger argued.* * * * * *For another group of scientists, the grievances with the press have emerged more recently, but arguably with far greater force. That’s because on an issue of great concern to these scientists — the various uses and abuses of somatic cell nuclear transfer, or cloning — journalists have swallowed the claims of the scientific fringe hook, line, and sinker.Consider the great 2002 cloning hoax. In the media lull following Christmas, one Brigitte Boisselier — the “scientific director” of Clonaid, a company linked to the UFO-obsessed Raelian sect, and already a semi-celebrity who had been profiled in The New York Times Magazine — announced the birth of the world’s first cloned baby. At her press conference, covered live by CNN, MSNBC, and Fox, Boisselier could not even produce a picture of the alleged child — “Eve” — much less independent scientific verification of her claims. She instead promised proof within eight or nine days. Needless to say, the whole affair should have made the press wary.Nevertheless, a media frenzy ensued, with journalists occasionally mocking and questioning the Raelians while allowing their claims to drive the coverage. CNN’s medical correspondent, Sanjay Gupta, provided a case in point. When he interviewed Boisselier following her press conference, Gupta called Clonaid a group with “the capacity to clone” and told Boisselier, credulously, “We are certainly going to be anxiously awaiting to see some of the proof from these independent scientists next week.”Perhaps most outspoken in criticizing the press during the Clonaid fiasco was Arthur Caplan, the University of Pennsylvania biomedical ethicist. As one of the nation’s most quoted bioethicists, Caplan had the advantage of actual access to the media during the feeding frenzy. Yet that familiarity made little difference. As Caplan complained in an MSNBC.com column following the Raelians’ announcement, no one wanted to listen to his skepticism because that would have required dropping the story: “As soon as I heard about the Raelians’ cloning claim, I knew it was nonsense,” wrote Caplan. “The media have shown themselves incapable of covering the key social and intellectual phenomena of the 21st century, namely the revolution in genetics and biology.”Caplan observed that Clonaid had no scientific peer-reviewed publications to prove its techniques were up to snuff, and that cloning had barely worked in live animal species, and then only after countless initial failures. Nevertheless, Clonaid had implausibly claimed a stunning success rate — five pregnancies in ten attempts — in its experiments.The Clonaid fiasco shows the media at their absolute worst in covering scientific issues. Reviewing the coverage two years later is a painful exercise. As even Gupta later admitted, “I think if we had known … that there was going to be no proof at this press conference, I think that we probably would have pulled the plug.” Later on, even the Raelians themselves reportedly laughed at how easy it was to get free publicity.But this wasn’t just fun and games. The political consequences of the press’s cloning coverage were considerable. Widespread fear of human cloning inevitably lends strength to sweeping legislation that would ban all forms of cloning, despite the fact that many scientists think the cloning of embryos for research purposes holds significant medical promise; it would allow for the creation of embryonic-stem-cell lines genetically matched to individual patients. Thus, on an issue where one side of the debate thrives on fear, the media delivered exactly what these cloning-ban advocates desired. Where the press’s unjustifiable addiction to “balance” on climate change produces a political stalemate on a pressing issue of global consequence, its addiction to cloning cranks provided a potent political weapon to the enemies of crucial research.None of those examples of poorly “balanced” science reporting arise from precisely the same set of journalistic shortcomings. In Scott Gold’s case at the Los Angeles Times, he appears to have known the scientific issues perfectly well. That gave his writing an authority that set off warning bells in an editor wary of bias. That’s very different from the Clonaid example, where sheer credulousness among members of the media — combined with sensationalism and a slow news period — were the problem. And that’s different still from the problem of false balance in the media coverage of climate change in the U.S., which has been chronic for more than a decade.Yet in each case, the basic journalistic remedy would probably be the same. As a general rule, journalists should treat fringe scientific claims with considerable skepticism, and find out what major peer-reviewed papers or assessments have to say about them. Moreover, they should adhere to the principle that the more outlandish or dramatic the claim, the more skepticism it warrants. The Los Angeles Times’s Carroll observes that “every good journalist has a bit of a contrarian in his soul,” but it is precisely this impulse that can lead reporters astray. The fact is, nonscientist journalists can all too easily fall for scientific-sounding claims that they can’t adequately evaluate on their own.That doesn’t mean that scientific consensus is right in every instance. There are famous examples, in fact, of when it was proved wrong: Galileo comes to mind, as does a lowly patent clerk named Einstein. In the vast majority of modern cases, however, scientific consensus can be expected to hold up under scrutiny precisely because it was reached through a lengthy and rigorous process of professional skepticism and criticism. At the very least, journalists covering science-based policy debates should familiarize themselves with this professional proving ground, learn what it says about the relative merits of competing claims, and “balance” their reports accordingly.This is brilliant!  Thank you.  Fals equivalencies are going to kill us all.How about the absence of any reporting negative to liberal sacred cows? Is not this a disservice to the cause of rational decision making?Head Start has no lasting educational benefits. Good luck finding this headline in the New York Timeshttp://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/hs/impact_study/reports/impact_study/hs_impact_study_final.pdf“…the benefits of access to Head Start at age four are largely absent by 1st grade for the program population as a whole. For 3-year-olds, there are few sustained benefits…”It would appear the solution would be to train a new generation of science-literate journalists as a top-down approach to spreading science awareness among the masses.At the very least that will probably mean requiring every journalism and communication’s major to take a course in science writing.Is this more or less practical than having scientist learn better communication skills? I’d say more practical because, in my experience, when you compare the course-load and amount of work required of journalism majors, it pales in comparison to most science majors, especially the “hard” sciences.Ideally we’d do both, of course.My fear is that one day PBS will ask callers to give their side of the story that the sun is warm or cold—call in caller, tell us what you think.Busiturle says:
- "“Head Start has no lasting educational benefits. Good luck finding this headline
  in the New York Times”http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/08/opinion/08besharov.html?_r=1I’ll
  grant that the headline is merely “Head Start Falls Behind” so you are technically
  correct.Also, I originally heard about that study on NPR. But you keep telling yourself
  that tired “liberal media bias” story. I don’t expect that it ever gets old to those
  who’s worldview requires them to believe it.I think i get it now. You think that
  the role of a science journalist is to tell people *what to think*, not to explain
  scientific conclusions, how they were arrived at, and what the objections were and
  how they were answered.Wouldn’t it be cool if some science magazine could undertake
  the latter task in an accessible way?What about your stance of being nice to the
  religious know-nothings so that they’ll come around? Be diplomatic and don’t make
  them feel like uneducated trash all the time, right?In the same vein, Carroll was
  right about the example at the start: Gold could have produced the same article
  with the same facts, but without the cheap shots. But that wouldn’t have hit people
  over the head so blatantly.Craig:4You do realize this is an opinion piece and not
  a news story.It is nice of the NY Times to publish the views of the authors, which
  I agree with, but this it not the same as reporters at the NY Times writing a story
  and publishing it in the news section of their paper.Bush is still president?Of
  course, it is easy to dismiss the opposition as “fringe,” particularly when there
  is the Climate Swindle agenda is in jeopardy.Christopher Walter Monckton said it
  best;  “Stop Screeching”I think the problem is that journalists don’t have the scientific
  education to be able to evaluate the science, as a result of which you are basically
  asking them to accept scientists as an authority they are unable to check or question
  (as they won’t understand the answers). And as journalists don’t have the scientific
  education to be able to list the reasons why science is different, they treat scientists
  in the same way as any other self-claimed authority figure. It is *their job* to
  challenge the statements of politicians, businessmen, and campaigners for this cause
  or that.Plus of course the role of journalists is not to educate, but to sell more
  newspapers, and controversy does that.Newspapers are corporates and as such are
  legally obligated to “maximize shareholder value”, that is sell more newspapers.
  Showing a “balanced” view and exaggerating “debates” alive sells more newspapers.
  If the editor of a newspaper had an attack of concsience and reported this as a
  non-issue, he’d be fired after the next quarterly balance is published. If his board
  of directors didn’t fire him, they’d be replaced (or even sued) by the stockholders/owners
  (these days, that’s a depressingly short list of people). The journalists themselves
  can’t do much about it – it isn’t their fault and if they buck the trend, they are
  much, much easier to fire (or pass for promotion, or be assigned to Zimbabwe, or
  whatever).If you want to change things, start hitting newspapers with serious financial
  penalties for reporting unsubstantiated crap as if it was fact. Paradoxically, this
  may be what is required to save this industry; they will never beat the Internet
  as a source of entertaining sound bites (kittens!), but may survive as a source
  of reliable news.You’d think the stockholders/owners would notice they are poisoning
  their own gold-laying goose, but in the current system, this year (or quarter) results
  are all that matter.Busiturtle:8I also note that the Washington Times hasn’t had
  a news story on your cited study. That darn liberal media bias extends to the moonie
  times!Have you considered telling the journalists to “ask the grad students”? While
  grad students might not be as knowledgeable as their advisors, they’re also likely
  to be less biased.  This may seem counterintuitive but there are two reasons for
  this: (1) senior scientists, especially prominent ones, may have their whole scientific
  identity tied up in the success of one of their theories whereas grad students and
  post docs are rarely as invested, and (2) someone with an uncertain career ahead
  is more likely to take a middle course, to maintain respect from all sides who will
  define his career. A grad student earns respect in the scientific arena not only
  for his/her research, but also for showing independence and an incisive view of
  what is at the heart of a dispute. Good grad students strive for this.This must
  be done carefully, of course, but the fresh perspective of the grad student just
  might be the one that knows where the “balance” is.I agree, balanced coverage is
  what we need more of. Finally the Times is starting to balance their coverage.http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article6991177.ecewho
  would of thought that when looked into the IPCC bases their assessments on he said
  she said. Looks like the Himalayas will be just fine post 2035. Bring on the SUV’sI
  just love this quote. Gullible fools are the most dangerous members of society.Some
  scientists have questioned how the IPCC could have allowed such a mistake into print.
  Perhaps the most likely reason was lack of expertise. Lal himself admits he knows
  little about glaciers. “I am not an expert on glaciers.and I have not visited the
  region so I have to rely on credible published research. The comments in the WWF
  report were made by a respected Indian scientist and it was reasonable to assume
  he knew what he was talking about,” he said.And let it be said again: How can one
  claim there is a consensus when there is none!http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/nov/09/india-pachauri-climate-glaciersTwo
  years ago, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN agency which
  evaluates the risk from global warming, warned the glaciers were receding faster
  than in any other part of the world and could “disappear altogether by 2035 if not
  sooner”.Today Ramesh denied any such risk existed: “There is no conclusive scientific
  evidence to link global warming with what is happening in the Himalayan glaciers.”
  The minister added although some glaciers are receding they were doing so at a rate
  that was not “historically alarming”.Busiturtle at 17:Yes,politicians objects to
  scientists, therefore no scientific consensus! Dumbass.Craig:18Does the IPCC represent
  the consensus view of climate science or is it simply a propaganda outlet? And how
  many more phony claims are in IPCC reports that have not been verified by science?http://justoneminute.typepad.com/main/2010/01/looking-for-the-disappearing-glaciers.html”
  The panel, which relies on contributions from hundreds of scientists, is considering
  whether to amend the estimate or remove it. ”“The flawed estimate raises more questions
  about the panel’s vetting procedures than it does about the melting of Himalayan
  glaciers, which most scientists believe is a major problem.”I just love the ending
  of that sentence: “which most scientists believe is a major problem”Belief?I thought
  science was about facts, not faith.This is all so very confusing.\r\n"

  the science world, if there is an overwhelming complaint about the media, it is
  that journalists tend to be too “balanced”–in other words, they give roughly 50-50
  time to opposing viewpoints even when one side lacks credibility, as in the creationism-evolution
  battle.\nIn 2004 in Columbia Journalism Review, I did a major article critiquing
  this problem in science coverage–an article that I guess a lot of people read and
  liked, since it is still mentioned to me regularly. Recently, in fact, John Fleck
  emailed to ask why it wasn’t available online–and I decided to do something about
  that.\nSo here it is, “Blinded by Science,” a kind of classic critique of “phony
  balance” in science coverage:\nBLINDED BY SCIENCE: How ‘Balanced’ Coverage Lets
  the Scientific Fringe Hijack Reality\nColumbia Journalism Review, Nov/Dec2004, Vol.
  43, Issue 4\nOn May 22, 2003, the Los Angeles Times printed a front-page story by
  Scott Gold, its respected Houston bureau chief, about the passage of a law in Texas
  requiring abortion doctors to warn women that the procedure might cause breast cancer.
  Virtually no mainstream scientist believes that the so-called ABC link actually
  exists — only anti-abortion activists do. Accordingly, Gold’s article noted right
  off the bat that the American Cancer Society discounts the “alleged link” and that
  anti-abortionists have pushed for “so-called counseling” laws only after failing
  in their attempts to have abortion banned. Gold also reported that the National
  Cancer Institute had convened “more than a hundred of the world’s experts” to assess
  the ABC theory, which they rejected. In comparison to these scientists, Gold noted,
  the author of the Texas counseling bill — who called the ABC issue “still disputed”
  — had “a professional background in property management.”\nGold’s piece was hard-hitting
  but accurate. The scientific consensus is quite firm that abortion does not cause
  breast cancer. If reporters want to take science and its conclusions seriously,
  their reporting should reflect this reality — no matter what antiabortionists say.\nBut
  what happened next illustrates one reason journalists have such a hard time calling
  it like they see it on science issues. In an internal memo exposed by the Web site
  LAobserved.com, the Times’s editor, John Carroll, singled out Gold’s story for harsh
  criticism, claiming it vindicated critics who accuse the paper of liberal bias.
  Carroll specifically criticized Gold’s “so-called counseling” line (“a phrase that
  is loaded with derision”) and his “professional background in property management”
  quip (“seldom will you read a cheaper shot than this”). “The story makes a strong
  case that the link between abortion and breast cancer is widely discounted among
  researchers,” Carroll wrote, “but I wondered as I read it whether somewhere there
  might exist some credible  scientist who believes in it …. Apparently the scientific
  argument for the anti-abortion side is so absurd that we don’t need to waste our
  readers’ time with it.”\nGold declined to comment specifically on Carroll’s memo,
  except to say that it prompted “a sound and good discussion of the standards that
  we all take very seriously.” For his part, Carroll — now editing his third newspaper
  — is hardly so naive as to think journalistic “balance” is synonymous with accuracy.
  In an interview, he nevertheless defended the memo, observing that “reporters have
  to make judgments about the validity of ideas” but that “a reporter has to be broad-minded
  in being open to ideas that aren’t necessarily shared by the crowd he or she happens
  to be hanging around with.” Carroll adds that in his view, Gold needed to find a
  credible scientist to defend the ABC claim, rather than merely quoting a legislator
  and then exposing that individual’s lack of scientific background. “You have an
  obligation to find a scientist, and if the scientist has something to say, then
  you can subject the scientist’s views to rigorous examination,” Carroll says.\nThe
  trouble is, the leading proponent of the idea that abortions cause breast cancer,
  Dr. Joel Brind of Baruch College at the City University of New York, underwent a
  pro-life religious conversion that left him feeling “compelled to use science for
  its noblest, life-saving purpose,” as he put it in Physician, a magazine published
  by a conservative religious group called Focus on the Family. Brind’s dedication
  to the ABC theory has flown in the face of repeated negative critiques of that theory
  by his scientific peers. When the National Cancer Institute convened the world’s
  experts to assess the question in February 2003, Brind was the only dissenter from
  the group’s conclusions.\nNevertheless, a later article by Gold suggests he may
  have taken Carroll’s lesson to heart (though Gold says the piece “certainly wasn’t
  a direct response, or an attempt to change anything or compensate” following Carroll’s
  memo). On November 6, 2003, Gold reported on a push in Texas to revise the way biology
  textbooks teach the scientific theory of evolution, which some religious conservatives
  don’t accept. Gold opened with a glowing profile of one William Dembski, described
  as a “scientist by trade” but “an evangelical Christian at heart who is convinced
  that some biological mechanisms are too complex to have been created without divine
  guidance.” But according to his Web site, Dembski is a philosopher and mathematician,
  not a biologist. Moreover, he’s a leader of the new “intelligent design” crusade
  against Darwin’s theory, an updated form of creationism that evolutionary biologists
  have broadly denounced. (He recently took a job running the Center for Science and
  Theology at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.) The American Association
  for the Advancement of Science, the world’s largest scientific society and publisher
  of Science, the highest-circulation general scientific journal, has firmly stated
  that proponents have “failed to offer credible scientific evidence to support their
  claim” that the intelligent design theory “undermines the current scientifically
  accepted theory of evolution.”\nScott Gold had it exactly right on abortion and
  breast cancer. Then he produced an article on “intelligent design” so artificially
  “balanced” it was downright inaccurate and misleading.\n* * * * *\nThe basic notion
  that journalists should go beyond mere “balance” in search of the actual truth hardly
  represents a novel insight. This magazine, along with its political Web site, Campaign
  Desk, has been part of a rising chorus against a prevalent but lazy form of journalism
  that makes no attempt to dig beneath competing claims. But for journalists raised
  on objectivity and tempered by accusations of bias, knowing that phony balance can
  create distortion is one thing and taking steps to fix the reporting is another.\nPolitical
  reporting hardly presents the only challenge for journalists seeking to go beyond
  he said/she said accounts, or even the most difficult one. Instead, that distinction
  may be reserved for media coverage of contested scientific issues, many of them
  with major policy ramifications, such as global climate change. After all, the journalistic
  norm of balance has no corollary in the world of science. On the contrary, scientific
  theories and interpretations survive or perish depending upon whether they’re published
  in highly competitive journals that practice strict quality control, whether the
  results upon which they’re based can be replicated by other scientists, and ultimately
  whether they win over scientific peers. When consensus builds, it is based on repeated
  testing and retesting of an idea.\nJournalists face a number of pressures that can
  prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their
  credibility within the scientific community as a whole. First, reporters must often
  deal with editors who reflexively cry out for “balance.” Meanwhile, determining
  how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate requires considerable
  expertise on the issue at hand. Few journalists have real scientific knowledge,
  and even beat reporters who know a great deal about certain scientific issues may
  know little about other ones they’re suddenly asked to cover.\nMoreover, the question
  of how to substitute accuracy for mere “balance” in science reporting has become
  ever more pointed as journalists have struggled to cover the Bush administration,
  which scientists have widely accused of scientific distortions. As the Union of
  Concerned Scientists, an alliance of citizens and scientists, and other critics
  have noted, Bush administration statements and actions have often given privileged
  status to a fringe scientific view over a well-documented, extremely robust mainstream
  conclusion. Journalists have thus had to decide whether to report on a he said/she
  said battle between scientists and the White House — which has had very few scientific
  defenders — or get to the bottom of each case of alleged distortion and report on
  who’s actually right.\nNo wonder scientists have often denounced the press for giving
  credibility to fringe scientific viewpoints. And without a doubt, the topic on which
  scientists have most vehemently decried both the media and the Bush administration
  is global warming. While some scientific uncertainty remains in the climate field,
  the most rigorous peer-reviewed assessments — produced roughly every five years
  by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) — have cemented
  a consensus view that human greenhouse gas emissions are probably (i.e., the conclusion
  has a fairly high degree of scientific certainty) helping to fuel the greenhouse
  effect and explain the observed planetary warming of the past fifty years. Yet the
  Bush administration has consistently sought to undermine this position by hyping
  lingering uncertainties and seeking to revise government scientific reports. It
  has also relied upon energy interests and a small cadre of dissenting scientists
  (some of whom are funded, in part, by industry) in formulating climate policy.\nThe
  centrality of the climate change issue to the scientific critique of the press does
  not arise by accident. Climate change has mind-bogglingly massive ramifications,
  not only for the future of our carbon-based economy but for the planet itself. Energy
  interests wishing to stave off action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have a
  documented history of supporting the small group of scientists who question the
  human role in causing climate change — as well as consciously strategizing about
  how to sow confusion on the issue and sway journalists.\nIn 1998, for instance,
  John H. Cushman, Jr., of The New York Times exposed an internal American Petroleum
  Institute memo outlining a strategy to invest millions to “maximize the impact of
  scientific views consistent with ours with Congress, the media and other key audiences.”
  Perhaps most startling, the memo cited a need to “recruit and train” scientists
  “who do not have a long history of visibility and/or participation in the climate
  change debate” to participate in media outreach and counter the mainstream scientific
  view. This seems to signal an awareness that after a while, journalists catch on
  to the connections between contrarian scientists and industry. But in the meantime,
  a window of opportunity apparently exists when reporters can be duped by fresh faces.\n“There’s
  a very small set of people” who question the consensus, says Science’s executive
  editor-in-chief, Donald Kennedy. “And there are a great many thoughtful reporters
  in the media who believe that in order to produce a balanced story, you’ve got to
  pick one commentator from side A and one commentator from side B. I call it the
  two-card Rolodex problem.”\nThe Stanford climatologist Stephen Schneider echoes
  this concern. A scientist whose interactions with the media on the subject of climate
  change span decades, Schneider has reflected at length on the subject, especially
  in his 1989 book Global Warming. Schneider’s climate-change Web site also devotes
  a section to what he calls “Mediarology,” where he notes that in science debates
  “there are rarely just two polar opposite sides, but rather a spectrum of potential
  outcomes, oftentimes accompanied by a considerable history of scientific assessment
  of the relative credibility of these many possibilities. A climate scientist faced
  with a reporter locked into the ‘get both sides’ mindset risks getting his or her
  views stuffed into one of two boxed storylines: ‘we’re worried’ or ‘it will all
  be okay.’ And sometimes, these two ‘boxes’ are misrepresentative; a mainstream,
  well-established consensus may be ‘balanced’ against the opposing views of a few
  extremists, and to the uninformed, each position seems equally credible.”\nAcademics
  have studied media coverage of climate change, and the results confirm climate scientists’
  longstanding complaints. In a recent paper published in the journal Global Environmental
  Change, the scholars Maxwell T. Boykoff and Jules M. Boykoff analyzed coverage of
  the issue in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and
  the Los Angeles Times between 1988 and 2002. During this fourteen-year period, climate
  scientists successfully forged a powerful consensus on human-caused climate change.
  But reporting in these four major papers did not at all reflect this consensus.\nThe
  Boykoffs analyzed a random sample of 636 articles. They found that a majority —
  52.7 percent — gave “roughly equal attention” to the scientific consensus view that
  humans contribute to climate change and to the energy-industry-supported view that
  natural fluctuations suffice to explain the observed warming. By comparison, just
  35.3 percent of articles emphasized the scientific consensus view while still presenting
  the other side in a subordinate fashion. Finally, 6.2 percent emphasized the industry-supported
  view, and a mere 5.9 percent focused on the consensus view without bothering to
  provide the industry/skeptic counterpoint.\nMost intriguing, the Boykoffs’ study
  found a shift in coverage between 1988 — when climate change first garnered wide
  media coverage — and 1990. During that period, journalists broadly moved from focusing
  on scientists’ views of climate change to providing “balanced” accounts. During
  this same period, the Boykoffs noted, climate change became highly politicized and
  a “small group of influential spokespeople and scientists emerged in the news” to
  question the mainstream view that industrial emissions are warming the planet. The
  authors conclude that the U.S. “prestige-press” has produced “informationally biased
  coverage of global warming … hidden behind the veil of journalistic balance.”\nIn
  a rich irony, a UPI report on August 30, 2004, about the Boykoffs’ study covered
  it in — that’s right — a thoroughly “balanced” fashion. The article gave considerable
  space to the viewpoint of Frank Maisano, a former spokesman for the industry-sponsored
  Global Climate Coalition and a professional media consultant, who called the Boykoffs’
  contentions “absolutely outrageous” and proceeded to reiterate many of the dubious
  criticisms of mainstream climate science for which the “skeptic” camp is so notorious.
  In the process, the UPI piece epitomized all the pathologies of U.S. coverage of
  climate change — pathologies that aren’t generally recapitulated abroad. Media research
  suggests that U.S. journalists cover climate change very differently from their
  European counterparts, often lending much more credence to the viewpoints of “skeptics”
  like Maisano.\nIn an interview, Maxwell Boykoff — an environmental studies Ph.D.
  candidate at the University of California at Santa Cruz — noted that if there’s
  one American journalist who cuts against the grain in covering the climate issue,
  it’s Andrew C. Revkin of The New York Times. That’s revealing, because Revkin happens
  to be the only reporter at any of the major newspapers studied who covers “global
  environmental change” as his exclusive beat, which Revkin says means writing about
  climate change “close to half” of the time. Revkin has also been covering global
  warming since 1988 and has written a book on the topic. (This fall he began teaching
  environmental reporting as an adjunct at Columbia’s Graduate School of Journalism.)\nRevkin
  agrees with the basic thrust of the Boykoff study, but he also notes that the analysis
  focuses only on the quantitative aspect of climate-change coverage, rather than
  more subtle qualitative questions such as how reporters “characterize the voices”
  of the people they quote.\nAfter all, the issue isn’t just how many column inches
  journalists give to the perspective of climate-change “skeptics” versus the mainstream
  view. It’s also how they identify these contrarian figures, many of whom have industry
  ties. Take a January 8, 2004, article by The Washington Post’s Guy Gugliotta, reporting
  on a study in the journal Nature finding that global warming could “drive 15 to
  37 percent of living species toward extinction by mid-century.” Gugliotta’s story
  hardly suffered from phony balance. But when it did include a “skeptic” perspective
  — in a thoroughly subordinate fashion in the ninth paragraph — the skeptic’s industry
  ties went unmentioned:\nOne skeptic, William O’Keefe, president of the George C.
  Marshall Institute, a conservative science policy organization, criticized the Nature
  study, saying that the research ‘ignored species’ ability to adapt to higher temperatures’
  and assumed that technologies will not arise to reduce emissions.\nWhat Gugliotta
  didn’t say is this: the Marshall Institute receives substantial support from oil
  giant ExxonMobil, a leading funder of think tanks, frequently conservative in orientation,
  that question the scientific consensus on climate change. Moreover, O’Keefe himself
  has chaired the anti-Kyoto Protocol Global Climate Coalition, and served as executive
  vice president and chief operating officer of the American Petroleum Institute.
  Senate documents from 2001 through 2003 also list him as a registered lobbyist for
  ExxonMobil. (To be fair, when I discussed this matter with O’Keefe while working
  on a previous article, he said that he registers as a lobbyist “out of an abundance
  of caution” and keeps his ExxonMobil and Marshall Institute work “separate.”)\nAsked
  about all of this, Gugliotta said he simply didn’t know of O’Keefe’s industry connections
  at the time. He said he considered O’Keefe a “reasoned skeptic” who provided a measured
  perspective from the other side of the issue. Fair enough. His industry ties don’t
  necessarily detract from that, but readers still should know about them.\nThe point
  isn’t to single out Gugliotta — any number of other examples could be found. And
  such omissions don’t merely occur on the news pages. Some major op-ed pages also
  appear to think that to fulfill their duty of providing a range of views, they should
  publish dubious contrarian opinion pieces on climate change even when those pieces
  are written by nonscientists. For instance, on July 7, 2003, The Washington Post
  published a revisionist op-ed on climate science by James Schlesinger, a former
  secretary of both energy and defense, and a former director of Central Intelligence.
  “In recent years the inclination has been to attribute the warming we have lately
  experienced to a single dominant cause — the increase in greenhouse gases,” wrote
  Schlesinger. “Yet climate has always been changing — and sometimes the swings have
  been rapid.” The clear implication was that scientists don’t know enough about the
  causes of climate change to justify strong pollution controls.\nThat’s not how most
  climatologists feel, but then Schlesinger is an economist by training, not a climatologist.
  Moreover, his Washington Post byline failed to note that he sits on the board of
  directors of Peabody Energy, the largest coal company in the world, and has since
  2001. Peabody has resisted the push for mandatory controls on greenhouse gas emissions,
  such as those that would be required by the Kyoto Protocol. In a 2001 speech, the
  Peabody executive John Wootten argued that “there remains great uncertainty in the
  scientific understanding of climate,” and that “imposition of immediate constraints
  on emissions from fossil-fuel use is not warranted.”\nFunny, that’s pretty much
  what Schlesinger argued.\n* * * * * *\nFor another group of scientists, the grievances
  with the press have emerged more recently, but arguably with far greater force.
  That’s because on an issue of great concern to these scientists — the various uses
  and abuses of somatic cell nuclear transfer, or cloning — journalists have swallowed
  the claims of the scientific fringe hook, line, and sinker.\nConsider the great
  2002 cloning hoax. In the media lull following Christmas, one Brigitte Boisselier
  — the “scientific director” of Clonaid, a company linked to the UFO-obsessed Raelian
  sect, and already a semi-celebrity who had been profiled in The New York Times Magazine
  — announced the birth of the world’s first cloned baby. At her press conference,
  covered live by CNN, MSNBC, and Fox, Boisselier could not even produce a picture
  of the alleged child — “Eve” — much less independent scientific verification of
  her claims. She instead promised proof within eight or nine days. Needless to say,
  the whole affair should have made the press wary.\nNevertheless, a media frenzy
  ensued, with journalists occasionally mocking and questioning the Raelians while
  allowing their claims to drive the coverage. CNN’s medical correspondent, Sanjay
  Gupta, provided a case in point. When he interviewed Boisselier following her press
  conference, Gupta called Clonaid a group with “the capacity to clone” and told Boisselier,
  credulously, “We are certainly going to be anxiously awaiting to see some of the
  proof from these independent scientists next week.”\nPerhaps most outspoken in criticizing
  the press during the Clonaid fiasco was Arthur Caplan, the University of Pennsylvania
  biomedical ethicist. As one of the nation’s most quoted bioethicists, Caplan had
  the advantage of actual access to the media during the feeding frenzy. Yet that
  familiarity made little difference. As Caplan complained in an MSNBC.com column
  following the Raelians’ announcement, no one wanted to listen to his skepticism
  because that would have required dropping the story: “As soon as I heard about the
  Raelians’ cloning claim, I knew it was nonsense,” wrote Caplan. “The media have
  shown themselves incapable of covering the key social and intellectual phenomena
  of the 21st century, namely the revolution in genetics and biology.”\nCaplan observed
  that Clonaid had no scientific peer-reviewed publications to prove its techniques
  were up to snuff, and that cloning had barely worked in live animal species, and
  then only after countless initial failures. Nevertheless, Clonaid had implausibly
  claimed a stunning success rate — five pregnancies in ten attempts — in its experiments.\nThe
  Clonaid fiasco shows the media at their absolute worst in covering scientific issues.
  Reviewing the coverage two years later is a painful exercise. As even Gupta later
  admitted, “I think if we had known … that there was going to be no proof at this
  press conference, I think that we probably would have pulled the plug.” Later on,
  even the Raelians themselves reportedly laughed at how easy it was to get free publicity.\nBut
  this wasn’t just fun and games. The political consequences of the press’s cloning
  coverage were considerable. Widespread fear of human cloning inevitably lends strength
  to sweeping legislation that would ban all forms of cloning, despite the fact that
  many scientists think the cloning of embryos for research purposes holds significant
  medical promise; it would allow for the creation of embryonic-stem-cell lines genetically
  matched to individual patients. Thus, on an issue where one side of the debate thrives
  on fear, the media delivered exactly what these cloning-ban advocates desired. Where
  the press’s unjustifiable addiction to “balance” on climate change produces a political
  stalemate on a pressing issue of global consequence, its addiction to cloning cranks
  provided a potent political weapon to the enemies of crucial research.\nNone of
  those examples of poorly “balanced” science reporting arise from precisely the same
  set of journalistic shortcomings. In Scott Gold’s case at the Los Angeles Times,
  he appears to have known the scientific issues perfectly well. That gave his writing
  an authority that set off warning bells in an editor wary of bias. That’s very different
  from the Clonaid example, where sheer credulousness among members of the media —
  combined with sensationalism and a slow news period — were the problem. And that’s
  different still from the problem of false balance in the media coverage of climate
  change in the U.S., which has been chronic for more than a decade.\nYet in each
  case, the basic journalistic remedy would probably be the same. As a general rule,
  journalists should treat fringe scientific claims with considerable skepticism,
  and find out what major peer-reviewed papers or assessments have to say about them.
  Moreover, they should adhere to the principle that the more outlandish or dramatic
  the claim, the more skepticism it warrants. The Los Angeles Times’s Carroll observes
  that “every good journalist has a bit of a contrarian in his soul,” but it is precisely
  this impulse that can lead reporters astray. The fact is, nonscientist journalists
  can all too easily fall for scientific-sounding claims that they can’t adequately
  evaluate on their own.\nThat doesn’t mean that scientific consensus is right in
  every instance. There are famous examples, in fact, of when it was proved wrong:
  Galileo comes to mind, as does a lowly patent clerk named Einstein. In the vast
  majority of modern cases, however, scientific consensus can be expected to hold
  up under scrutiny precisely because it was reached through a lengthy and rigorous
  process of professional skepticism and criticism. At the very least, journalists
  covering science-based policy debates should familiarize themselves with this professional
  proving ground, learn what it says about the relative merits of competing claims,
  and “balance” their reports accordingly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n                                CATEGORIZED

  think the problem is that journalists don’t have the scientific education to be
  able to evaluate the science, as a result of which you are basically asking them
  to accept scientists as an authority they are unable to check or question (as they
  won’t understand the answers). And as journalists don’t have the scientific education
  to be able to list the reasons why science is different, they treat scientists in
  the same way as any other self-claimed authority figure. It is *their job* to challenge
  the statements of politicians, businessmen, and campaigners for this cause or that.\nPlus
  of course the role of journalists is not to educate, but to sell more newspapers,
  and controversy does that.\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary

  are corporates and as such are legally obligated to “maximize shareholder value”,
  that is sell more newspapers. Showing a “balanced” view and exaggerating “debates”
  alive sells more newspapers. If the editor of a newspaper had an attack of concsience
  and reported this as a non-issue, he’d be fired after the next quarterly balance
  is published. If his board of directors didn’t fire him, they’d be replaced (or
  even sued) by the stockholders/owners (these days, that’s a depressingly short list
  of people). The journalists themselves can’t do much about it – it isn’t their fault
  and if they buck the trend, they are much, much easier to fire (or pass for promotion,
  or be assigned to Zimbabwe, or whatever).\nIf you want to change things, start hitting
  newspapers with serious financial penalties for reporting unsubstantiated crap as
  if it was fact. Paradoxically, this may be what is required to save this industry;
  they will never beat the Internet as a source of entertaining sound bites (kittens!),
  but may survive as a source of reliable news.\nYou’d think the stockholders/owners
  would notice they are poisoning their own gold-laying goose, but in the current
  system, this year (or quarter) results are all that matter.\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary

  you considered telling the journalists to “ask the grad students”? While grad students
  might not be as knowledgeable as their advisors, they’re also likely to be less
  biased.  This may seem counterintuitive but there are two reasons for this: (1)
  senior scientists, especially prominent ones, may have their whole scientific identity
  tied up in the success of one of their theories whereas grad students and post docs
  are rarely as invested, and (2) someone with an uncertain career ahead is more likely
  to take a middle course, to maintain respect from all sides who will define his
  career. A grad student earns respect in the scientific arena not only for his/her
  research, but also for showing independence and an incisive view of what is at the
  heart of a dispute. Good grad students strive for this.\nThis must be done carefully,
  of course, but the fresh perspective of the grad student just might be the one that
  knows where the “balance” is.\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary

  sooner”.\nToday Ramesh denied any such risk existed: “There is no conclusive scientific
  evidence to link global warming with what is happening in the Himalayan glaciers.”

  battle.In 2004 in Columbia Journalism Review, I did a major article critiquing this
  problem in science coverage–an article that I guess a lot of people read and liked,
  since it is still mentioned to me regularly. Recently, in fact, John Fleck emailed
  to ask why it wasn’t available online–and I decided to do something about that.So
  here it is, “Blinded by Science,” a kind of classic critique of “phony balance”
  in science coverage:BLINDED BY SCIENCE: How ‘Balanced’ Coverage Lets the Scientific
  Fringe Hijack RealityColumbia Journalism Review, Nov/Dec2004, Vol. 43, Issue 4On
  May 22, 2003, the Los Angeles Times printed a front-page story by Scott Gold, its
  respected Houston bureau chief, about the passage of a law in Texas requiring abortion
  doctors to warn women that the procedure might cause breast cancer. Virtually no
  mainstream scientist believes that the so-called ABC link actually exists — only
  anti-abortion activists do. Accordingly, Gold’s article noted right off the bat
  that the American Cancer Society discounts the “alleged link” and that anti-abortionists
  have pushed for “so-called counseling” laws only after failing in their attempts
  to have abortion banned. Gold also reported that the National Cancer Institute had
  convened “more than a hundred of the world’s experts” to assess the ABC theory,
  which they rejected. In comparison to these scientists, Gold noted, the author of
  the Texas counseling bill — who called the ABC issue “still disputed” — had “a professional
  background in property management.”Gold’s piece was hard-hitting but accurate. The
  scientific consensus is quite firm that abortion does not cause breast cancer. If
  reporters want to take science and its conclusions seriously, their reporting should
  reflect this reality — no matter what antiabortionists say.But what happened next
  illustrates one reason journalists have such a hard time calling it like they see
  it on science issues. In an internal memo exposed by the Web site LAobserved.com,
  the Times’s editor, John Carroll, singled out Gold’s story for harsh criticism,
  claiming it vindicated critics who accuse the paper of liberal bias. Carroll specifically
  criticized Gold’s “so-called counseling” line (“a phrase that is loaded with derision”)
  and his “professional background in property management” quip (“seldom will you
  read a cheaper shot than this”). “The story makes a strong case that the link between
  abortion and breast cancer is widely discounted among researchers,” Carroll wrote,
  “but I wondered as I read it whether somewhere there might exist some credible 
  scientist who believes in it …. Apparently the scientific argument for the anti-abortion
  side is so absurd that we don’t need to waste our readers’ time with it.”Gold declined
  to comment specifically on Carroll’s memo, except to say that it prompted “a sound
  and good discussion of the standards that we all take very seriously.” For his part,
  Carroll — now editing his third newspaper — is hardly so naive as to think journalistic
  “balance” is synonymous with accuracy. In an interview, he nevertheless defended
  the memo, observing that “reporters have to make judgments about the validity of
  ideas” but that “a reporter has to be broad-minded in being open to ideas that aren’t
  necessarily shared by the crowd he or she happens to be hanging around with.” Carroll
  adds that in his view, Gold needed to find a credible scientist to defend the ABC
  claim, rather than merely quoting a legislator and then exposing that individual’s
  lack of scientific background. “You have an obligation to find a scientist, and
  if the scientist has something to say, then you can subject the scientist’s views
  to rigorous examination,” Carroll says.The trouble is, the leading proponent of
  the idea that abortions cause breast cancer, Dr. Joel Brind of Baruch College at
  the City University of New York, underwent a pro-life religious conversion that
  left him feeling “compelled to use science for its noblest, life-saving purpose,”
  as he put it in Physician, a magazine published by a conservative religious group
  called Focus on the Family. Brind’s dedication to the ABC theory has flown in the
  face of repeated negative critiques of that theory by his scientific peers. When
  the National Cancer Institute convened the world’s experts to assess the question
  in February 2003, Brind was the only dissenter from the group’s conclusions.Nevertheless,
  a later article by Gold suggests he may have taken Carroll’s lesson to heart (though
  Gold says the piece “certainly wasn’t a direct response, or an attempt to change
  anything or compensate” following Carroll’s memo). On November 6, 2003, Gold reported
  on a push in Texas to revise the way biology textbooks teach the scientific theory
  of evolution, which some religious conservatives don’t accept. Gold opened with
  a glowing profile of one William Dembski, described as a “scientist by trade” but
  “an evangelical Christian at heart who is convinced that some biological mechanisms
  are too complex to have been created without divine guidance.” But according to
  his Web site, Dembski is a philosopher and mathematician, not a biologist. Moreover,
  he’s a leader of the new “intelligent design” crusade against Darwin’s theory, an
  updated form of creationism that evolutionary biologists have broadly denounced.
  (He recently took a job running the Center for Science and Theology at the Southern
  Baptist Theological Seminary.) The American Association for the Advancement of Science,
  the world’s largest scientific society and publisher of Science, the highest-circulation
  general scientific journal, has firmly stated that proponents have “failed to offer
  credible scientific evidence to support their claim” that the intelligent design
  theory “undermines the current scientifically accepted theory of evolution.”Scott
  Gold had it exactly right on abortion and breast cancer. Then he produced an article
  on “intelligent design” so artificially “balanced” it was downright inaccurate and
  misleading.* * * * *The basic notion that journalists should go beyond mere “balance”
  in search of the actual truth hardly represents a novel insight. This magazine,
  along with its political Web site, Campaign Desk, has been part of a rising chorus
  against a prevalent but lazy form of journalism that makes no attempt to dig beneath
  competing claims. But for journalists raised on objectivity and tempered by accusations
  of bias, knowing that phony balance can create distortion is one thing and taking
  steps to fix the reporting is another.Political reporting hardly presents the only
  challenge for journalists seeking to go beyond he said/she said accounts, or even
  the most difficult one. Instead, that distinction may be reserved for media coverage
  of contested scientific issues, many of them with major policy ramifications, such
  as global climate change. After all, the journalistic norm of balance has no corollary
  in the world of science. On the contrary, scientific theories and interpretations
  survive or perish depending upon whether they’re published in highly competitive
  journals that practice strict quality control, whether the results upon which they’re
  based can be replicated by other scientists, and ultimately whether they win over
  scientific peers. When consensus builds, it is based on repeated testing and retesting
  of an idea.Journalists face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately
  depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific
  community as a whole. First, reporters must often deal with editors who reflexively
  cry out for “balance.” Meanwhile, determining how much weight to give different
  sides in a scientific debate requires considerable expertise on the issue at hand.
  Few journalists have real scientific knowledge, and even beat reporters who know
  a great deal about certain scientific issues may know little about other ones they’re
  suddenly asked to cover.Moreover, the question of how to substitute accuracy for
  mere “balance” in science reporting has become ever more pointed as journalists
  have struggled to cover the Bush administration, which scientists have widely accused
  of scientific distortions. As the Union of Concerned Scientists, an alliance of
  citizens and scientists, and other critics have noted, Bush administration statements
  and actions have often given privileged status to a fringe scientific view over
  a well-documented, extremely robust mainstream conclusion. Journalists have thus
  had to decide whether to report on a he said/she said battle between scientists
  and the White House — which has had very few scientific defenders — or get to the
  bottom of each case of alleged distortion and report on who’s actually right.No
  wonder scientists have often denounced the press for giving credibility to fringe
  scientific viewpoints. And without a doubt, the topic on which scientists have most
  vehemently decried both the media and the Bush administration is global warming.
  While some scientific uncertainty remains in the climate field, the most rigorous
  peer-reviewed assessments — produced roughly every five years by the United Nations’
  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) — have cemented a consensus view
  that human greenhouse gas emissions are probably (i.e., the conclusion has a fairly
  high degree of scientific certainty) helping to fuel the greenhouse effect and explain
  the observed planetary warming of the past fifty years. Yet the Bush administration
  has consistently sought to undermine this position by hyping lingering uncertainties
  and seeking to revise government scientific reports. It has also relied upon energy
  interests and a small cadre of dissenting scientists (some of whom are funded, in
  part, by industry) in formulating climate policy.The centrality of the climate change
  issue to the scientific critique of the press does not arise by accident. Climate
  change has mind-bogglingly massive ramifications, not only for the future of our
  carbon-based economy but for the planet itself. Energy interests wishing to stave
  off action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have a documented history of supporting
  the small group of scientists who question the human role in causing climate change
  — as well as consciously strategizing about how to sow confusion on the issue and
  sway journalists.In 1998, for instance, John H. Cushman, Jr., of The New York Times
  exposed an internal American Petroleum Institute memo outlining a strategy to invest
  millions to “maximize the impact of scientific views consistent with ours with Congress,
  the media and other key audiences.” Perhaps most startling, the memo cited a need
  to “recruit and train” scientists “who do not have a long history of visibility
  and/or participation in the climate change debate” to participate in media outreach
  and counter the mainstream scientific view. This seems to signal an awareness that
  after a while, journalists catch on to the connections between contrarian scientists
  and industry. But in the meantime, a window of opportunity apparently exists when
  reporters can be duped by fresh faces.“There’s a very small set of people” who question
  the consensus, says Science’s executive editor-in-chief, Donald Kennedy. “And there
  are a great many thoughtful reporters in the media who believe that in order to
  produce a balanced story, you’ve got to pick one commentator from side A and one
  commentator from side B. I call it the two-card Rolodex problem.”The Stanford climatologist
  Stephen Schneider echoes this concern. A scientist whose interactions with the media
  on the subject of climate change span decades, Schneider has reflected at length
  on the subject, especially in his 1989 book Global Warming. Schneider’s climate-change
  Web site also devotes a section to what he calls “Mediarology,” where he notes that
  in science debates “there are rarely just two polar opposite sides, but rather a
  spectrum of potential outcomes, oftentimes accompanied by a considerable history
  of scientific assessment of the relative credibility of these many possibilities.
  A climate scientist faced with a reporter locked into the ‘get both sides’ mindset
  risks getting his or her views stuffed into one of two boxed storylines: ‘we’re
  worried’ or ‘it will all be okay.’ And sometimes, these two ‘boxes’ are misrepresentative;
  a mainstream, well-established consensus may be ‘balanced’ against the opposing
  views of a few extremists, and to the uninformed, each position seems equally credible.”Academics
  have studied media coverage of climate change, and the results confirm climate scientists’
  longstanding complaints. In a recent paper published in the journal Global Environmental
  Change, the scholars Maxwell T. Boykoff and Jules M. Boykoff analyzed coverage of
  the issue in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and
  the Los Angeles Times between 1988 and 2002. During this fourteen-year period, climate
  scientists successfully forged a powerful consensus on human-caused climate change.
  But reporting in these four major papers did not at all reflect this consensus.The
  Boykoffs analyzed a random sample of 636 articles. They found that a majority —
  52.7 percent — gave “roughly equal attention” to the scientific consensus view that
  humans contribute to climate change and to the energy-industry-supported view that
  natural fluctuations suffice to explain the observed warming. By comparison, just
  35.3 percent of articles emphasized the scientific consensus view while still presenting
  the other side in a subordinate fashion. Finally, 6.2 percent emphasized the industry-supported
  view, and a mere 5.9 percent focused on the consensus view without bothering to
  provide the industry/skeptic counterpoint.Most intriguing, the Boykoffs’ study found
  a shift in coverage between 1988 — when climate change first garnered wide media
  coverage — and 1990. During that period, journalists broadly moved from focusing
  on scientists’ views of climate change to providing “balanced” accounts. During
  this same period, the Boykoffs noted, climate change became highly politicized and
  a “small group of influential spokespeople and scientists emerged in the news” to
  question the mainstream view that industrial emissions are warming the planet. The
  authors conclude that the U.S. “prestige-press” has produced “informationally biased
  coverage of global warming … hidden behind the veil of journalistic balance.”In
  a rich irony, a UPI report on August 30, 2004, about the Boykoffs’ study covered
  it in — that’s right — a thoroughly “balanced” fashion. The article gave considerable
  space to the viewpoint of Frank Maisano, a former spokesman for the industry-sponsored
  Global Climate Coalition and a professional media consultant, who called the Boykoffs’
  contentions “absolutely outrageous” and proceeded to reiterate many of the dubious
  criticisms of mainstream climate science for which the “skeptic” camp is so notorious.
  In the process, the UPI piece epitomized all the pathologies of U.S. coverage of
  climate change — pathologies that aren’t generally recapitulated abroad. Media research
  suggests that U.S. journalists cover climate change very differently from their
  European counterparts, often lending much more credence to the viewpoints of “skeptics”
  like Maisano.In an interview, Maxwell Boykoff — an environmental studies Ph.D. candidate
  at the University of California at Santa Cruz — noted that if there’s one American
  journalist who cuts against the grain in covering the climate issue, it’s Andrew
  C. Revkin of The New York Times. That’s revealing, because Revkin happens to be
  the only reporter at any of the major newspapers studied who covers “global environmental
  change” as his exclusive beat, which Revkin says means writing about climate change
  “close to half” of the time. Revkin has also been covering global warming since
  1988 and has written a book on the topic. (This fall he began teaching environmental
  reporting as an adjunct at Columbia’s Graduate School of Journalism.)Revkin agrees
  with the basic thrust of the Boykoff study, but he also notes that the analysis
  focuses only on the quantitative aspect of climate-change coverage, rather than
  more subtle qualitative questions such as how reporters “characterize the voices”
  of the people they quote.After all, the issue isn’t just how many column inches
  journalists give to the perspective of climate-change “skeptics” versus the mainstream
  view. It’s also how they identify these contrarian figures, many of whom have industry
  ties. Take a January 8, 2004, article by The Washington Post’s Guy Gugliotta, reporting
  on a study in the journal Nature finding that global warming could “drive 15 to
  37 percent of living species toward extinction by mid-century.” Gugliotta’s story
  hardly suffered from phony balance. But when it did include a “skeptic” perspective
  — in a thoroughly subordinate fashion in the ninth paragraph — the skeptic’s industry
  ties went unmentioned:One skeptic, William O’Keefe, president of the George C. Marshall
  Institute, a conservative science policy organization, criticized the Nature study,
  saying that the research ‘ignored species’ ability to adapt to higher temperatures’
  and assumed that technologies will not arise to reduce emissions.What Gugliotta
  didn’t say is this: the Marshall Institute receives substantial support from oil
  giant ExxonMobil, a leading funder of think tanks, frequently conservative in orientation,
  that question the scientific consensus on climate change. Moreover, O’Keefe himself
  has chaired the anti-Kyoto Protocol Global Climate Coalition, and served as executive
  vice president and chief operating officer of the American Petroleum Institute.
  Senate documents from 2001 through 2003 also list him as a registered lobbyist for
  ExxonMobil. (To be fair, when I discussed this matter with O’Keefe while working
  on a previous article, he said that he registers as a lobbyist “out of an abundance
  of caution” and keeps his ExxonMobil and Marshall Institute work “separate.”)Asked
  about all of this, Gugliotta said he simply didn’t know of O’Keefe’s industry connections
  at the time. He said he considered O’Keefe a “reasoned skeptic” who provided a measured
  perspective from the other side of the issue. Fair enough. His industry ties don’t
  necessarily detract from that, but readers still should know about them.The point
  isn’t to single out Gugliotta — any number of other examples could be found. And
  such omissions don’t merely occur on the news pages. Some major op-ed pages also
  appear to think that to fulfill their duty of providing a range of views, they should
  publish dubious contrarian opinion pieces on climate change even when those pieces
  are written by nonscientists. For instance, on July 7, 2003, The Washington Post
  published a revisionist op-ed on climate science by James Schlesinger, a former
  secretary of both energy and defense, and a former director of Central Intelligence.
  “In recent years the inclination has been to attribute the warming we have lately
  experienced to a single dominant cause — the increase in greenhouse gases,” wrote
  Schlesinger. “Yet climate has always been changing — and sometimes the swings have
  been rapid.” The clear implication was that scientists don’t know enough about the
  causes of climate change to justify strong pollution controls.That’s not how most
  climatologists feel, but then Schlesinger is an economist by training, not a climatologist.
  Moreover, his Washington Post byline failed to note that he sits on the board of
  directors of Peabody Energy, the largest coal company in the world, and has since
  2001. Peabody has resisted the push for mandatory controls on greenhouse gas emissions,
  such as those that would be required by the Kyoto Protocol. In a 2001 speech, the
  Peabody executive John Wootten argued that “there remains great uncertainty in the
  scientific understanding of climate,” and that “imposition of immediate constraints
  on emissions from fossil-fuel use is not warranted.”Funny, that’s pretty much what
  Schlesinger argued.* * * * * *For another group of scientists, the grievances with
  the press have emerged more recently, but arguably with far greater force. That’s
  because on an issue of great concern to these scientists — the various uses and
  abuses of somatic cell nuclear transfer, or cloning — journalists have swallowed
  the claims of the scientific fringe hook, line, and sinker.Consider the great 2002
  cloning hoax. In the media lull following Christmas, one Brigitte Boisselier — the
  “scientific director” of Clonaid, a company linked to the UFO-obsessed Raelian sect,
  and already a semi-celebrity who had been profiled in The New York Times Magazine
  — announced the birth of the world’s first cloned baby. At her press conference,
  covered live by CNN, MSNBC, and Fox, Boisselier could not even produce a picture
  of the alleged child — “Eve” — much less independent scientific verification of
  her claims. She instead promised proof within eight or nine days. Needless to say,
  the whole affair should have made the press wary.Nevertheless, a media frenzy ensued,
  with journalists occasionally mocking and questioning the Raelians while allowing
  their claims to drive the coverage. CNN’s medical correspondent, Sanjay Gupta, provided
  a case in point. When he interviewed Boisselier following her press conference,
  Gupta called Clonaid a group with “the capacity to clone” and told Boisselier, credulously,
  “We are certainly going to be anxiously awaiting to see some of the proof from these
  independent scientists next week.”Perhaps most outspoken in criticizing the press
  during the Clonaid fiasco was Arthur Caplan, the University of Pennsylvania biomedical
  ethicist. As one of the nation’s most quoted bioethicists, Caplan had the advantage
  of actual access to the media during the feeding frenzy. Yet that familiarity made
  little difference. As Caplan complained in an MSNBC.com column following the Raelians’
  announcement, no one wanted to listen to his skepticism because that would have
  required dropping the story: “As soon as I heard about the Raelians’ cloning claim,
  I knew it was nonsense,” wrote Caplan. “The media have shown themselves incapable
  of covering the key social and intellectual phenomena of the 21st century, namely
  the revolution in genetics and biology.”Caplan observed that Clonaid had no scientific
  peer-reviewed publications to prove its techniques were up to snuff, and that cloning
  had barely worked in live animal species, and then only after countless initial
  failures. Nevertheless, Clonaid had implausibly claimed a stunning success rate
  — five pregnancies in ten attempts — in its experiments.The Clonaid fiasco shows
  the media at their absolute worst in covering scientific issues. Reviewing the coverage
  two years later is a painful exercise. As even Gupta later admitted, “I think if
  we had known … that there was going to be no proof at this press conference, I think
  that we probably would have pulled the plug.” Later on, even the Raelians themselves
  reportedly laughed at how easy it was to get free publicity.But this wasn’t just
  fun and games. The political consequences of the press’s cloning coverage were considerable.
  Widespread fear of human cloning inevitably lends strength to sweeping legislation
  that would ban all forms of cloning, despite the fact that many scientists think
  the cloning of embryos for research purposes holds significant medical promise;
  it would allow for the creation of embryonic-stem-cell lines genetically matched
  to individual patients. Thus, on an issue where one side of the debate thrives on
  fear, the media delivered exactly what these cloning-ban advocates desired. Where
  the press’s unjustifiable addiction to “balance” on climate change produces a political
  stalemate on a pressing issue of global consequence, its addiction to cloning cranks
  provided a potent political weapon to the enemies of crucial research.None of those
  examples of poorly “balanced” science reporting arise from precisely the same set
  of journalistic shortcomings. In Scott Gold’s case at the Los Angeles Times, he
  appears to have known the scientific issues perfectly well. That gave his writing
  an authority that set off warning bells in an editor wary of bias. That’s very different
  from the Clonaid example, where sheer credulousness among members of the media —
  combined with sensationalism and a slow news period — were the problem. And that’s
  different still from the problem of false balance in the media coverage of climate
  change in the U.S., which has been chronic for more than a decade.Yet in each case,
  the basic journalistic remedy would probably be the same. As a general rule, journalists
  should treat fringe scientific claims with considerable skepticism, and find out
  what major peer-reviewed papers or assessments have to say about them. Moreover,
  they should adhere to the principle that the more outlandish or dramatic the claim,
  the more skepticism it warrants. The Los Angeles Times’s Carroll observes that “every
  good journalist has a bit of a contrarian in his soul,” but it is precisely this
  impulse that can lead reporters astray. The fact is, nonscientist journalists can
  all too easily fall for scientific-sounding claims that they can’t adequately evaluate
  on their own.That doesn’t mean that scientific consensus is right in every instance.
  There are famous examples, in fact, of when it was proved wrong: Galileo comes to
  mind, as does a lowly patent clerk named Einstein. In the vast majority of modern
  cases, however, scientific consensus can be expected to hold up under scrutiny precisely
  because it was reached through a lengthy and rigorous process of professional skepticism
  and criticism. At the very least, journalists covering science-based policy debates
  should familiarize themselves with this professional proving ground, learn what
  it says about the relative merits of competing claims, and “balance” their reports
  accordingly.This is brilliant!  Thank you.  Fals equivalencies are going to kill
  us all.How about the absence of any reporting negative to liberal sacred cows? Is
  not this a disservice to the cause of rational decision making?Head Start has no
  lasting educational benefits. Good luck finding this headline in the New York Timeshttp://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/hs/impact_study/reports/impact_study/hs_impact_study_final.pdf“…the
  benefits of access to Head Start at age four are largely absent by 1st grade for
  the program population as a whole. For 3-year-olds, there are few sustained benefits…”It
  would appear the solution would be to train a new generation of science-literate
  journalists as a top-down approach to spreading science awareness among the masses.At
  the very least that will probably mean requiring every journalism and communication’s
  major to take a course in science writing.Is this more or less practical than having
  scientist learn better communication skills? I’d say more practical because, in
  my experience, when you compare the course-load and amount of work required of journalism
  majors, it pales in comparison to most science majors, especially the “hard” sciences.Ideally
  we’d do both, of course.My fear is that one day PBS will ask callers to give their
  side of the story that the sun is warm or cold—call in caller, tell us what you
  think.Busiturle says:\n“Head Start has no lasting educational benefits. Good luck
  finding this headline in the New York Times”http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/08/opinion/08besharov.html?_r=1I’ll
  grant that the headline is merely “Head Start Falls Behind” so you are technically
  correct.Also, I originally heard about that study on NPR. But you keep telling yourself
  that tired “liberal media bias” story. I don’t expect that it ever gets old to those
  who’s worldview requires them to believe it.I think i get it now. You think that
  the role of a science journalist is to tell people *what to think*, not to explain
  scientific conclusions, how they were arrived at, and what the objections were and
  how they were answered.Wouldn’t it be cool if some science magazine could undertake
  the latter task in an accessible way?What about your stance of being nice to the
  religious know-nothings so that they’ll come around? Be diplomatic and don’t make
  them feel like uneducated trash all the time, right?In the same vein, Carroll was
  right about the example at the start: Gold could have produced the same article
  with the same facts, but without the cheap shots. But that wouldn’t have hit people
  over the head so blatantly.Craig:4You do realize this is an opinion piece and not
  a news story.It is nice of the NY Times to publish the views of the authors, which
  I agree with, but this it not the same as reporters at the NY Times writing a story
  and publishing it in the news section of their paper.Bush is still president?Of
  course, it is easy to dismiss the opposition as “fringe,” particularly when there
  is the Climate Swindle agenda is in jeopardy.Christopher Walter Monckton said it
  best;  “Stop Screeching”I think the problem is that journalists don’t have the scientific
  education to be able to evaluate the science, as a result of which you are basically
  asking them to accept scientists as an authority they are unable to check or question
  (as they won’t understand the answers). And as journalists don’t have the scientific
  education to be able to list the reasons why science is different, they treat scientists
  in the same way as any other self-claimed authority figure. It is *their job* to
  challenge the statements of politicians, businessmen, and campaigners for this cause
  or that.Plus of course the role of journalists is not to educate, but to sell more
  newspapers, and controversy does that.Newspapers are corporates and as such are
  legally obligated to “maximize shareholder value”, that is sell more newspapers.
  Showing a “balanced” view and exaggerating “debates” alive sells more newspapers.
  If the editor of a newspaper had an attack of concsience and reported this as a
  non-issue, he’d be fired after the next quarterly balance is published. If his board
  of directors didn’t fire him, they’d be replaced (or even sued) by the stockholders/owners
  (these days, that’s a depressingly short list of people). The journalists themselves
  can’t do much about it – it isn’t their fault and if they buck the trend, they are
  much, much easier to fire (or pass for promotion, or be assigned to Zimbabwe, or
  whatever).If you want to change things, start hitting newspapers with serious financial
  penalties for reporting unsubstantiated crap as if it was fact. Paradoxically, this
  may be what is required to save this industry; they will never beat the Internet
  as a source of entertaining sound bites (kittens!), but may survive as a source
  of reliable news.You’d think the stockholders/owners would notice they are poisoning
  their own gold-laying goose, but in the current system, this year (or quarter) results
  are all that matter.Busiturtle:8I also note that the Washington Times hasn’t had
  a news story on your cited study. That darn liberal media bias extends to the moonie
  times!Have you considered telling the journalists to “ask the grad students”? While
  grad students might not be as knowledgeable as their advisors, they’re also likely
  to be less biased.  This may seem counterintuitive but there are two reasons for
  this: (1) senior scientists, especially prominent ones, may have their whole scientific
  identity tied up in the success of one of their theories whereas grad students and
  post docs are rarely as invested, and (2) someone with an uncertain career ahead
  is more likely to take a middle course, to maintain respect from all sides who will
  define his career. A grad student earns respect in the scientific arena not only
  for his/her research, but also for showing independence and an incisive view of
  what is at the heart of a dispute. Good grad students strive for this.This must
  be done carefully, of course, but the fresh perspective of the grad student just
  might be the one that knows where the “balance” is.I agree, balanced coverage is
  what we need more of. Finally the Times is starting to balance their coverage.http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article6991177.ecewho
  would of thought that when looked into the IPCC bases their assessments on he said
  she said. Looks like the Himalayas will be just fine post 2035. Bring on the SUV’sI
  just love this quote. Gullible fools are the most dangerous members of society.Some
  scientists have questioned how the IPCC could have allowed such a mistake into print.
  Perhaps the most likely reason was lack of expertise. Lal himself admits he knows
  little about glaciers. “I am not an expert on glaciers.and I have not visited the
  region so I have to rely on credible published research. The comments in the WWF
  report were made by a respected Indian scientist and it was reasonable to assume
  he knew what he was talking about,” he said.And let it be said again: How can one
  claim there is a consensus when there is none!http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/nov/09/india-pachauri-climate-glaciersTwo
  years ago, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN agency which
  evaluates the risk from global warming, warned the glaciers were receding faster
  than in any other part of the world and could “disappear altogether by 2035 if not
  sooner”.Today Ramesh denied any such risk existed: “There is no conclusive scientific
  evidence to link global warming with what is happening in the Himalayan glaciers.”
  The minister added although some glaciers are receding they were doing so at a rate
  that was not “historically alarming”.Busiturtle at 17:Yes,politicians objects to
  scientists, therefore no scientific consensus! Dumbass.Craig:18Does the IPCC represent
  the consensus view of climate science or is it simply a propaganda outlet? And how
  many more phony claims are in IPCC reports that have not been verified by science?http://justoneminute.typepad.com/main/2010/01/looking-for-the-disappearing-glaciers.html”
  The panel, which relies on contributions from hundreds of scientists, is considering
