- "            Archaeologist Dennis Jenkins holds three western stemmed projectile…
  (Jim Barlow / University…)New evidence from caves in Oregon may finally put to rest
  the long-held theory that the early people who made Clovis spear points were the
  first inhabitants of North America.The new evidence indicates that a second group
  of people that made what are known as western stemmed projectile points arrived
  on the North American continent at least as early as those who made the Clovis points,
  and perhaps even earlier. The new finds provide strong support for growing genetic
  evidence that indicates the Americas were populated in at least three waves of immigration
  beginning at least 15,000 years ago.\"Our evidence puts the final blow to the Clovis
  First theory,\" said geneticist Eske Willerslev of the University of Copenhagen
  in Denmark. \"Culturally, biologically and chronologically, the theory is no longer
  viable.\"The accumulation of new data represents \"almost a revolution in our understanding
  of the early colonization of the Americas,\" said Brooks Hanson, an editor at the
  journal Science, in which the newest data was published Thursday. var adSkipCounter
  = 0; The distinctive fluted Clovis spear points were first discovered in 1932 at
  Blackwater Draw, near the village of Clovis, N.M. They have subsequently been found
  throughout the eastern and Southern United States, and artifacts associated with
  them have been dated to about 13,000 years ago.It has long been held that the points
  were made by people who immigrated to North America from Asia across the Bering
  land bridge, a route connecting Siberia and Alaska exposed when ocean levels fell
  during the most recent ice age. A second, technologically distinct spear point known
  as the western stemmed projectile point has been found throughout much of the western
  United States, and Clovis proponents have argued that it was a descendant of the
  Clovis technology. The two types of spear points differ primarily in how they are
  attached to the shaft of the spear.The first crack in the Clovis First theory came
  in 2008 when Willerslev, archaeologist Dennis L. Jenkins of the University of Oregon,
  and their colleagues reported they had found 14,300-year-old human coprolites in
  the Paisley Caves of Oregon. Coprolites are essentially desiccated human feces.
  The team found other artifacts with the coprolites, but no Clovis points.Critics,
  however, argued the coprolites had been contaminated, perhaps by the excavators
  or by animals urinating at the site. The critics also argued the stratigraphy of
  the site may have been scrambled by rodents burrowing through the sediments. Essentially,
  they claimed, the results were bogus.The Paisley Caves, originally discovered in
  1938 by University of Oregon anthropologist Luther Cressman, are in the Summer Lake
  basin about 220 miles southeast of Eugene on the east side of the Cascade Range.
  The eight caves, which face to the west, are wave-cut shelters on the shoreline
  of Lake Chewaucan, whose levels have risen and fallen with climate change.Angered
  by the criticism, Jenkins and his students have revisited the caves during each
  of the last three summers. They wore full body suits, face masks and gloves to prevent
  human contamination of samples -- even though they had analyzed DNA of all the archaeologists
  and lab workers involved with the earlier study to rule out contamination.The team
  also drilled small core samples through several different regions of the caves,
  dating each layer of sediment to show the layers had not been jumbled. Organic samples
  destined for radiocarbon dating were soaked in distilled water to remove potential
  contaminants. The distilled water itself was also dated to determine when foreign
  materials might have been introduced. They also found western stemmed projectile
  points, but no Clovis points.Their conclusions: the same as before. The human sample
  dating was accurate and the western stemmed projectiles were 12,800 to 13,000 years
  old -- at least as old as the oldest dated Clovis points.\"From our dating, it appears
  to be impossible to derive western stemmed points from a proto-Clovis tradition,\"
  Jenkins said. \"\"It suggests that we may have here in the western United States
  a tradition that is at least as old as Clovis, and quite possibly older. We seem
  to have two different traditions co-existing in the United States that did not blend
  for a period of hundreds of years.\"The increasingly older ages of human habitation
  of the continent suggests at least some of the new immigrants could not have crossed
  the Bering land bridge -- it was covered with water when they came.University of
  Oregon archaeologist Jon Erlandson has been accumulating evidence -- much of it
  from the Channel Islands off the California coast -- that some of the first immigrants
  might have been a seagoing people that migrated along the coast lines of Asia and
  North America, exploiting wildlife found in kelp beds along the coast. Many of their
  potential camp sites and shelters, however, would have been flooded by rising sea
  levels and are no longer accessible.Intriguingly, stemmed projectiles that could
  be attached to spears originated in Asia about 4,000 to 5,000 years before the points
  in the Paisley Caves were created, but archaeologists have never found either Clovis
  points or western stemmed points on that continent. The lack of evidence thus suggests
  that the technology for making both was uniquely American.LATimesScience@gmail.comTwitter/@LATMaugh/*

- '                    New evidence from caves in Oregon may finally put to rest the
  long-held theory that the early people who made Clovis spear points were the first
  inhabitants of North America.The new evidence indicates that a second group of people
  that made what are known as western stemmed projectile points arrived on the North
  American continent at least as early as those who made the Clovis points, and perhaps
  even earlier. The new finds provide strong support for growing genetic evidence
  that indicates the Americas were populated in at least three waves of immigration
  beginning at least 15,000 years ago."Our evidence puts the final blow to the Clovis
  First theory," said geneticist Eske Willerslev of the University of Copenhagen in
  Denmark. "Culturally, biologically and chronologically, the theory is no longer
  viable."The accumulation of new data represents "almost a revolution in our understanding
  of the early colonization of the Americas," said Brooks Hanson, an editor at the
  journal Science, in which the newest data was published Thursday.The distinctive
  fluted Clovis spear points were first discovered in 1932 at Blackwater Draw, near
  the village of Clovis, N.M. They have subsequently been found throughout the eastern
  and Southern United States, and artifacts associated with them have been dated to
  about 13,000 years ago.It has long been held that the points were made by people
  who immigrated to North America from Asia across the Bering land bridge, a route
  connecting Siberia and Alaska exposed when ocean levels fell during the most recent
  ice age. A second, technologically distinct spear point known as the western stemmed
  projectile point has been found throughout much of the western United States, and
  Clovis proponents have argued that it was a descendant of the Clovis technology.
  The two types of spear points differ primarily in how they are attached to the shaft
  of the spear.The first crack in the Clovis First theory came in 2008 when Willerslev,
  archaeologist Dennis L. Jenkins of the University of Oregon, and their colleagues
  reported they had found 14,300-year-old human coprolites in the Paisley Caves of
  Oregon. Coprolites are essentially desiccated human feces. The team found other
  artifacts with the coprolites, but no Clovis points.Critics, however, argued the
  coprolites had been contaminated, perhaps by the excavators or by animals urinating
  at the site. The critics also argued the stratigraphy of the site may have been
  scrambled by rodents burrowing through the sediments. Essentially, they claimed,
  the results were bogus.The Paisley Caves, originally discovered in 1938 by University
  of Oregon anthropologist Luther Cressman, are in the Summer Lake basin about 220
  miles southeast of Eugene on the east side of the Cascade Range. The eight caves,
  which face to the west, are wave-cut shelters on the shoreline of Lake Chewaucan,
  whose levels have risen and fallen with climate change.Angered by the criticism,
  Jenkins and his students have revisited the caves during each of the last three
  summers. They wore full body suits, face masks and gloves to prevent human contamination
  of samples -- even though they had analyzed DNA of all the archaeologists and lab
  workers involved with the earlier study to rule out contamination.The team also
  drilled small core samples through several different regions of the caves, dating
  each layer of sediment to show the layers had not been jumbled. Organic samples
  destined for radiocarbon dating were soaked in distilled water to remove potential
  contaminants. The distilled water itself was also dated to determine when foreign
  materials might have been introduced. They also found western stemmed projectile
  points, but no Clovis points.Their conclusions: the same as before. The human sample
  dating was accurate and the western stemmed projectiles were 12,800 to 13,000 years
  old -- at least as old as the oldest dated Clovis points."From our dating, it appears
  to be impossible to derive western stemmed points from a proto-Clovis tradition,"
  Jenkins said. ""It suggests that we may have here in the western United States a
  tradition that is at least as old as Clovis, and quite possibly older. We seem to
  have two different traditions co-existing in the United States that did not blend
  for a period of hundreds of years."The increasingly older ages of human habitation
  of the continent suggests at least some of the new immigrants could not have crossed
  the Bering land bridge -- it was covered with water when they came.University of
  Oregon archaeologist Jon Erlandson has been accumulating evidence -- much of it
  from the Channel Islands off the California coast -- that some of the first immigrants
  might have been a seagoing people that migrated along the coast lines of Asia and
  North America, exploiting wildlife found in kelp beds along the coast. Many of their
  potential camp sites and shelters, however, would have been flooded by rising sea
  levels and are no longer accessible.Intriguingly, stemmed projectiles that could
  be attached to spears originated in Asia about 4,000 to 5,000 years before the points
  in the Paisley Caves were created, but archaeologists have never found either Clovis
  points or western stemmed points on that continent. The lack of evidence thus suggests
  that the technology for making both was uniquely American.LATimesScience@gmail.comTwitter/@LATMaugh'

  Jenkins holds three western stemmed projectile… (Jim Barlow / University…)New evidence
  from caves in Oregon may finally put to rest the long-held theory that the early
  people who made Clovis spear points were the first inhabitants of North America.The
  new evidence indicates that a second group of people that made what are known as
  western stemmed projectile points arrived on the North American continent at least
  as early as those who made the Clovis points, and perhaps even earlier. The new
  finds provide strong support for growing genetic evidence that indicates the Americas
  were populated in at least three waves of immigration beginning at least 15,000
  years ago.\"Our evidence puts the final blow to the Clovis First theory,\" said
  geneticist Eske Willerslev of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. \"Culturally,
  biologically and chronologically, the theory is no longer viable.\"The accumulation
  of new data represents \"almost a revolution in our understanding of the early colonization
  of the Americas,\" said Brooks Hanson, an editor at the journal Science, in which
  the newest data was published Thursday. var adSkipCounter = 0; The distinctive fluted
  Clovis spear points were first discovered in 1932 at Blackwater Draw, near the village
  of Clovis, N.M. They have subsequently been found throughout the eastern and Southern
  United States, and artifacts associated with them have been dated to about 13,000
  years ago.It has long been held that the points were made by people who immigrated
  to North America from Asia across the Bering land bridge, a route connecting Siberia
  and Alaska exposed when ocean levels fell during the most recent ice age. A second,
  technologically distinct spear point known as the western stemmed projectile point
  has been found throughout much of the western United States, and Clovis proponents
  have argued that it was a descendant of the Clovis technology. The two types of
  spear points differ primarily in how they are attached to the shaft of the spear.The
  first crack in the Clovis First theory came in 2008 when Willerslev, archaeologist
  Dennis L. Jenkins of the University of Oregon, and their colleagues reported they
  had found 14,300-year-old human coprolites in the Paisley Caves of Oregon. Coprolites
  are essentially desiccated human feces. The team found other artifacts with the
  coprolites, but no Clovis points.Critics, however, argued the coprolites had been
  contaminated, perhaps by the excavators or by animals urinating at the site. The
  critics also argued the stratigraphy of the site may have been scrambled by rodents
  burrowing through the sediments. Essentially, they claimed, the results were bogus.The
  Paisley Caves, originally discovered in 1938 by University of Oregon anthropologist
  Luther Cressman, are in the Summer Lake basin about 220 miles southeast of Eugene
  on the east side of the Cascade Range. The eight caves, which face to the west,
  are wave-cut shelters on the shoreline of Lake Chewaucan, whose levels have risen
  and fallen with climate change.Angered by the criticism, Jenkins and his students
  have revisited the caves during each of the last three summers. They wore full body
  suits, face masks and gloves to prevent human contamination of samples -- even though
  they had analyzed DNA of all the archaeologists and lab workers involved with the
  earlier study to rule out contamination.The team also drilled small core samples
  through several different regions of the caves, dating each layer of sediment to
  show the layers had not been jumbled. Organic samples destined for radiocarbon dating
  were soaked in distilled water to remove potential contaminants. The distilled water
  itself was also dated to determine when foreign materials might have been introduced.
  They also found western stemmed projectile points, but no Clovis points.Their conclusions:
  the same as before. The human sample dating was accurate and the western stemmed
  projectiles were 12,800 to 13,000 years old -- at least as old as the oldest dated
  Clovis points.\"From our dating, it appears to be impossible to derive western stemmed
  points from a proto-Clovis tradition,\" Jenkins said. \"\"It suggests that we may
  have here in the western United States a tradition that is at least as old as Clovis,
  and quite possibly older. We seem to have two different traditions co-existing in
  the United States that did not blend for a period of hundreds of years.\"The increasingly
  older ages of human habitation of the continent suggests at least some of the new
  immigrants could not have crossed the Bering land bridge -- it was covered with
  water when they came.University of Oregon archaeologist Jon Erlandson has been accumulating
  evidence -- much of it from the Channel Islands off the California coast -- that
  some of the first immigrants might have been a seagoing people that migrated along
  the coast lines of Asia and North America, exploiting wildlife found in kelp beds
  along the coast. Many of their potential camp sites and shelters, however, would
  have been flooded by rising sea levels and are no longer accessible.Intriguingly,
  stemmed projectiles that could be attached to spears originated in Asia about 4,000
  to 5,000 years before the points in the Paisley Caves were created, but archaeologists
  have never found either Clovis points or western stemmed points on that continent.
  The lack of evidence thus suggests that the technology for making both was uniquely
