  Indiana University students get it all—the storybook experience of what college
  should be like, and the endless opportunities that come with it. Top-ranked academics.
  Awe-inspiring faculty. Dynamic campus life. International culture. Phenomenal music
  and arts events. The excitement of IU Hoosier sports. And a jaw-droppingly beautiful
  campus.IU Bloomington is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and is a member
  of the North Central Association. Learn more about our accreditation.Founded in
  1820, Indiana University Bloomington is the flagship campus of IU’s eight campuses
  statewide. Innovation, creativity, and academic freedom are hallmarks of our world-class
  contributions in research and the arts.A legacy of preparing leadersWe’ve nurtured
  doers and leaders over our past two centuries by creating an academic atmosphere
  where revolutionary ideas and unexpected collaborations rule the day. IU educational
  experiences change the lives of our graduates—and the lives of the communities they
  serve as experts and professionals.There are larger universities in America. There
  are older universities in America. There are none, however, more typical of the
  American ideal of educational opportunity.Herman B Wells, Past IU President and
  ChancellorFrom African history to analytical chemistryEnvironmental policy, social
  psychology, music, nuclear physics, foreign languages—our diverse academic programs
  are among the best, with several ranking #1 and in the top 10 nationally. We’re

  of music and fine artsThe top-ranked IU Jacobs School of Music and our fine arts,
  theatre, and entertainment offerings rival much larger cities. IU stages more than
  1,000 performances every year, in venues that are artistic experiences in themselves.
  The Musical Arts Center—which we call “the mac”—is one of the grandest arts venues
  in the United States, seating 1,460 and featuring a 90′ x 60′ main stage.The MAC
  stage is often compared to the New York Metropolitan Opera.Trekking the globe with
  open minds and big heartsWe extend our famous IU “Hoosier hospitality” to ideas
  as well as people. With open-mindedness and kindheartedness, we support a diverse,
  international environment that seeks out all perspectives and draws on our global
