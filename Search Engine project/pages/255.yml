                  ALCHEMY
- "                \n"
- "            \tThe alchemy of the sixteenth and the seventeenth\n"
- |2
                      centuries represents a fusion of many seemingly dis-
- |2
                          parate themes derived from ancient and medieval Near and Far
- |2
                      Eastern sources. A simple definition is difficult if not impossible. The
- |2
                      alchemists always maintained
- |2
                       a special interest in the changes of matter and surely most of
- |2
                      them accepted the concept of transmutation, but there were other
- |2
                      significant strains evident in al- chemical
- |2
                      thought as well. Important among these was the early and persistent belief
- |2
                      that the study of alchemy had a special role in medicine through the
- |2
                      preparation of remedies and the search for the prolongation of life.
- |2
                      In addition to this was the belief that alchemy was the fundamental science
- |2
                      for the investigation of nature. And yet, if the alchemists spoke
- |2
                      repeatedly of experi- ence and observation as
- |2
                      the true keys to nature, they also maintained a fervent belief in a
- |2
                      universe unified through the relationship of the macrocosm and the
- |2
                      microcosm—a relationship that of necessity tied this science to
- |2
                      astrology. The alchemists were convinced further that their search for the
- |2
                      truths of nature might be conceived in terms of a religious quest which
- |2
                      would result in a greater knowledge of the Creator. It is not
- |2
                      surprising then to find a late sixteenth-century author defining medicine
- |2
                      as “the searching out of the secretes of nature,” a
- |2
                      goal that was to be accomplished by resort to “mathematicall and
- |2
                      supernaturall precepts, the ex- ercise whereof
- |2
                      is Mechanicall, and to be accomplished with labor.” Having thus
- |2
                      defined medicine, he went on to state that the real name of this art was
- |2
                      simply chemistry or alchemy (Bostocke, 1585).
- |2
                  In short, while few would deny that there were elements of modern science in
- |2
                      alchemy, it is also true that this was a study permeated with a
- |2
                      mysticism foreign to the post-Newtonian world.

                          ALCHEMY IN ANTIQUITY
- "                    \n"
- |2
                  The difficulty in dating alchemical texts has resulted in a long-standing
- |2
                      controversy over its origins. Yet, if the priority of Near Eastern, Indian,
- |2
                      and Chinese al- chemists remains in dispute,
- |2
                      there is general agreement among scholars that the student in search of the
- |2
                      roots of alchemy must be concerned not only with early concepts of
- |2
                      nature, but also with the practical craft traditions of antiquity. The
- |2
                      oldest surviving works of metal craftsmen combine an emphasis on the
- |2
                      change in the appearance of metals with the acceptance of a vitalistic
- |2
                      view of nature—a view that included the belief that metals live
- |2
                      and grow within the earth in a fashion analogous to the growth of a human
- |2
                      fetus. It was to become fundamental to alchemical thought that the
- |2
                      operator might hasten the natural process of metallic growth in his
- |2
                      laboratory and thus bring about perfection in a period of time far less
- |2
                      than that required by nature.
- |2
                  Several texts point to the existence of a practical proto-alchemical
- |2
                      literature in the ancient Near East. The recent study of two Babylonian
- |2
                      tablets (Oppen- heim, 1966) dating from the
- |2
                      thirteenth century B.C.028
- |2
                       but copied from still earlier originals describes the
- |2
                      production of “silver” from a copper/bronze mixture.
- |2
                      These early recipes already contain elements of ritual and the processes
- |2
                      themselves call for secrecy. Both were to become common themes in later
- |2
                      alchemical literature. The Leiden and Stockholm papyri (ca. third
- |2
                      century A.D.) would appear to be part of the same practical tradition.
- |2
                      Here, among some three hundred recipes, will be found directions for the
- |2
                      imitation of the noble metals. A method for the doubling of asem (the gold-silver alloy, electrum) indicates the
- |2
                      future direction of alchemical literature. The similarity be- tween the directions given in these papyri and
- |2
                          passa- ges in the Physica et Mystica of Bolos Democritos of Mendes (perhaps as
- |2
                      early as 200 B.C.) indicates that the latter work also profited from an
- |2
                      acquaintance with the metal craft tradition. However, mystical
- |2
                      passages in his work were to become the subject of exegesis for
- |2
                      Hellenistic alchemists of late antiquity. The pseudo-Democritos was revered
- |2
                      by them as a sage of great authority and his work thus forms a
- |2
                      connecting link between the practical metal craft tradition and the
- |2
                      true Alexandrian alchemy of late antiquity.
- |2
                  Alexandrian alchemy was based on Greek philosophy as well as on the
- |2
                      practical tradition of the craftsmen. The early comparisons of man and
- |2
                      nature found in the pre-Socratics and in Plato's Timaeus fostered an inter- est in the
- |2
                      relationship of the macrocosm and the microcosm, a doctrine which played a
- |2
                      major role in alchemical thought well into the seventeenth century.
- |2
                      Systems of intermediary beings and the pneuma were
- |2
                      employed by the Stoics, the Neo-Platonists, and other philosophical sects
- |2
                      in antiquity to provide connecting links between the two worlds.
- |2
                  Also important for the development of alchemical thought was the long
- |2
                      tradition of speculation on the Creation. The philosopher interested in
- |2
                      both the Crea- tion and Nature was inevitably
- |2
                      drawn to the question of the origin of the elements and the possibility of aprima materia. The views of the pre-Socratics on
- |2
                      the prime matter formed a springboard from which later authors
- |2
                      launched their own concepts. Thus Aristotle conveniently summarized the
- |2
                      views of his predecessors prior to refuting them in his Metaphysics. However, the subject was one of no less importance
- |2
                      to him than it had been to them. Aristotle accepted the four
- |2
                      Empedoclean elements (earth, air, water, and fire) with their attendant
- |2
                      qualities and he believed that they were mutually transmutable.
- |2
                  The genesis of the elements also forms an important section of Plato's Timaeus where the subject is devel- oped mathematically, but to alchemical authors of
- |2
                      late antiquity who were influenced by Neo-Platonic, Gnos- tic, and Christian sources, the accounts found in Gene
- |2
                      sis and the Pymander attributed to Hermes
- |2
                          Trisme- gistus were no less
- |2
                      significant. Surely the alchemical literature was stamped with a
- |2
                      Creation-element theme throughout its existence. In the sixteenth and
- |2
                      the seventeenth centuries chemical authors still focused on the
- |2
                      elements in their defense or attack of any given system. An important
- |2
                      example may be found in Ger- hard Dorn's defense
- |2
                      of the Paracelsians which he based on an analysis of the
- |2
                      “Physics of Genesis” and the “Physics of
- |2
                      Hermes.” Similarly Robert Boyle placed special emphasis on the
- |2
                      problem of the elements in his criticism of the Aristotelians and the
- |2
                      Paracelsian chemists in the Sceptical Chymist
- |2
                      (1661).
- |2
                  The earliest true alchemical texts in Greek date from the end of the third
- |2
                      century A.D. These are clearly connected with the earlier practical
- |2
                      tradition as well as with current philosophical and religious thought.
- |2
                      Two of the more important authors are Zosimos, author of the encyclopedic
- |2
                          Cheirokmeta, whose work links these alchemical
- |2
                      texts with the book of Bolos Demo- critos,
- |2
                      and Maria the Jewess, whose text is significant for its detailed
- |2
                      description of the laboratory equipment of the Alexandrian alchemist. The
- |2
                      latter work indicates that the emphasis on distillation and sublimation
- |2
                          proc- esses—still so pronounced
- |2
                      in the Renaissance—was already characteristic of alchemical
- |2
                      recipes in late antiquity. These Alexandrian texts are openly con- cerned with transmutation. The processes
- |2
                      given stress color change as a guide to progress—from black
- |2
                      to white to yellow to violet. The sequence was clearly associated with
- |2
                      the change from a chaotic and un- defined
- |2
                      primal matter to metallic perfection. And al-
- |2
                      though the final stage was eventually to be changed from violet to
- |2
                      red, the emphasis on color was to remain a basic theme in descriptions of
- |2
                      the Great Work.
- |2
                  Although practical recipes form part of these third-
- |2
                          and fourth-century texts there is also present in them a
- |2
                      pronounced interest in secrecy and mysticism. Alle-
- |2
                          gorical dream sequences form part of this literature, and the
- |2
                      role of spirits is considered important in the transformation of matter.
- |2
                      And while one may extract some scientific information from the Greek
- |2
                      alchemical codices, he will find it difficult to separate this
- |2
                      material from the ever-present religious aura that pervades these
- |2
                      works. An example may be seen in the analogous treat-
- |2
                          ment of metals and mankind. Because of the truth of this it was
- |2
                      felt that the operator might follow the death and resurrection theme as he
- |2
                      pursued his work. It was this aspect of alchemical thought that dominates
- |2
                      the later Greek texts. The work of Stephanos (ca. 610-41) is replete
- |2
                      with prayers, invocations, and allegorical descriptions. There is little
- |2
                      indication here that the alchemist still had close personal contact with
- |2
                      the laboratory. The text of Stephanos was highly influential029
- |2
                       and it was used by later alchemists both as a model and as a
- |2
                      subject for commentaries. Alexandrian al- chemy
- |2
                      did not continue much longer as a living tradi-
- |2
                      tion. Before the tenth century the basic texts had been codified and
- |2
                      few new texts were composed in Greek after that time.
- |2
                  Although Pliny and Dioscorides refer to mineral substances of medical value,
- |2
                      Hellenistic alchemical texts do not indicate any real concern with pharma- ceutical chemistry. This is in
- |2
                      marked contrast with the development of alchemy in China and India. As
- |2
                      early as the eighth century B.C. there was a belief in physical
- |2
                      immortality in China, and this was later to become closely associated with
- |2
                      Taoist thought. A text from the second century B.C. refers to the
- |2
                      transmutation of cinnabar to gold and within a few hundred years the
- |2
                      concept of longevity was to be clearly connected with chemically prepared
- |2
                      drugs and elixirs. This is evident in the Nei P'ien
- |2
                      of Ko Hung (ca. A.D. 320) which was to become a standard Chinese text on
- |2
                      this subject. In it will be found sections on the transmutation of
- |2
                      metals and on elixirs of life—and all this mixed with rules
- |2
                      for the attainment of long life and immortality. Chinese alchemy paralleled
- |2
                      Alexandrian alchemy in its frequent reference to the macrocosm-microcosm
- |2
                      analogy as well as in the development of both esoteric and exoteric
- |2
                      approaches to this subject. Thus, while the Chinese alchemist sought a
- |2
                      potable gold and various chemically prepared drugs in his quest for
- |2
                      longevity and immor- tality, the texts also
- |2
                      indicate a real interest in alchemy as the search for the inner perfection
- |2
                      of the soul.
- |2
                  From India the Sanskrit Atharva Veda (perhaps as
- |2
                      early as the eighth century B.C.) refers to the use of gold as a means of
- |2
                      preserving life, and there are other early texts relating gold to
- |2
                      immortality. Buddhist texts of the second to the fifth centuries A.D.
- |2
                      discuss the transmutation of base metals to gold by means of a juice
- |2
                      concocted from vegetable and mineral sources. The still later tantric-Hatha
- |2
                      yoga texts (post-eighth century) show the same trend toward increased mys- ticism already noted in the Greek and the
- |2
                      Chinese sources. Here the operator undergoes the experience of an
- |2
                      initiatory death and this is followed by a resur-
- |2
                          rection. In metals the result may be seen in the perfec- tion of gold—in man, the
- |2
                      alchemist induces in his own person a similar separation of spirit from
- |2
                      gross matter. In this case the result is a perfected person with an
- |2
                      infinitely prolonged youth.

                          ISLAMIC ALCHEMY
- "                    \n"
- |2
                  Similarities between Chinese and Indian alchemy have long led to
- |2
                      speculations regarding the possible transmission of common concepts. To
- |2
                      date, however, few facts have come to light to substantiate these
- |2
                       speculations. The origins of Islamic alchemy are some- what easier to discern. Here there is
- |2
                      little question about the importance of Greek sources. Traditionally
- |2
                      Prince Khalid ibn Yazid (d. 704) was the first Muslim convert to alchemy
- |2
                      and it is significant that his teacher was said to be one Morienos, a pupil
- |2
                      of the legendary Stephanos of Alexandria. Although there is little likeli- hood of truth in this story, the strong
- |2
                      Greek influence on Islamic alchemy may be further confirmed by fre- quent references to Alexandrian authors and
- |2
                      the gen- eral use of Greek philosophical
- |2
                      concepts. Translations were made into Arabic at learned centers
- |2
                      throughout the Near East not only of the works of such major figures
- |2
                      as Aristotle, Galen, and Ptolemy, but also of Zosimos, Bolos Democritos,
- |2
                      and Stephanos. Among these centers the old Sassanian academy at Jundi- Shapur played a role. Similarly a
- |2
                      group of Sabians at Harran were influential in transmitting Indian alchemi- cal and astrological thought into the
- |2
                      Islamic tradition.
- |2
                  The ascription of alchemical works to earlier authors was as common to
- |2
                      Islamic authors as it had been to their Greek predecessors. The short
- |2
                      alchemical classic, the “Emerald Table,” was said to
- |2
                      have been written by Hermes Trismegistus, but the earliest surviving
- |2
                      version is in an early ninth-century Arabic text ascribed to the
- |2
                      first-century (A.D.) magician, Apollonios of Tyana. A similar problem
- |2
                      exists in regard to the Turba philosophorum.
- |2
                      This exists only in Latin, but it has been shown by E. J. Holmyard and J.
- |2
                      Ruska to have been composed originally in Arabic early in the tenth cen- tury. The dialogue form is used in the Turba and the speakers are supposedly the Greek
- |2
                      philosophers of an- tiquity. Islamic alchemy
- |2
                      did not confine itself to Greek sages and gods alone in this regard. The
- |2
                      eighth-century scholar, Jabir-ibn-Hayyan, probably authored only a few
- |2
                      works on alchemy. However, some two thousand titles are ascribed to him.
- |2
                      The great bulk of these seem to derive from members of the Isma'ilya sect,
- |2
                      the Brotherhood of Purity, and they date from the ninth and the tenth
- |2
                      centuries.
- |2
                  Islamic alchemy is characterized by both the practi-
- |2
                          cal and the mystical elements seen in the earlier Greek texts.
- |2
                      There are frequent warnings that the information being revealed is for the
- |2
                      initiated alone and there is a continued use of the allegorical approach
- |2
                      which had become common in late Greek works. The religious nature of
- |2
                      the art is emphasized and the predominant vitalism favored by alchemical
- |2
                      authors may be seen in discussions of the generation of metals, and in
- |2
                      the sexual interpretation of fundamental stages of the great work. As
- |2
                      in the Alexandrian texts the progress of the operator may be followed
- |2
                      through the now standard sequence of color changes. The concept of the
- |2
                          philoso- pher's stone is also well
- |2
                      developed in the Arabic litera-030
- "                    \n"
- |2
                      ture. This stone allegedly provided a substance which brought
- |2
                      about the rapid transmutation of base metals to gold. It derived from the
- |2
                      earlier concept of special elixirs which might cure illnesses in man and
- |2
                      which in an analogous fashion might perfect—or
- |2
                      cure— imperfect metals in inanimate nature.
- |2
                  Aristotelian element theory is commonly employed in the Arabic texts, but in
- |2
                      addition the Jabirian works employed the Sulphur-Mercury theory of the
- |2
                      metals. This concept suggests that all metals are composed of
- |2
                      different proportions of a sophic sulphur and a sophic mercury. While there
- |2
                      was general agreement that these two substances have a resemblance to
- |2
                      common sulphur and mercury, it was asserted that they were much purer
- |2
                      than anything that could be produced in the laboratory. A quantitative
- |2
                      relationship between the two was implied, but the mathematical
- |2
                      relationship expressed in these texts may be most easily related to
- |2
                      the number mysticism favored by the Neo-Pythago- reans and Eastern mystics. Although the Sulphur- Mercury theory appears first in
- |2
                      this literature, it seems to be a modification of the concept of the two
- |2
                          exhala- tions within the earth that lead
- |2
                      to the formation of minerals and metals. This concept is discussed in
- |2
                      the fourth book of Aristotle's Meteorologica.
- |2
                  In the Arabic literature the reader finds an emphasis on medical chemistry
- |2
                      for the first time outside of the Far East and India. The work of the
- |2
                      physician al-Razi (Rhazes, 860-925) is decidedly practical in nature.
- |2
                      Although he accepted the truth of transmutation and discussed elixirs of
- |2
                      varying powers, in the Book of the Secret of Secrets
- |2
                      Razi spoke at length of chemical equipment and he described in detail the
- |2
                      laboratory operations requisite for the chemist. In addition he
- |2
                      described a large number of laboratory reagents and classified them into
- |2
                      the categories of “animal,” “min- eral,”
- |2
                      “vegetable,” and “derivative.”
- |2
                      Chemical texts continued to employ the first three of these as a basic
- |2
                      scheme for arrangement until well into the eighteenth century. Razi's
- |2
                      interest in medicine and practical chemistry influenced later Islamic work
- |2
                      in medical chemistry. The work of ibn-Sina (Avicenna, 980-1037) and
- |2
                      Abu Mansur Muwaffak (late tenth century) indi-
- |2
                      cates a special interest in chemically prepared sub- stances of pharmaceutical value.

- "                \n"
- |2
                  Western alchemy developed from Arabic sources. As Islamic scholars had
- |2
                      sought alchemical texts in the eighth century, so their Latin counterparts
- |2
                      sought sim- ilar works four centuries later. The
- |2
                      earliest dated Latin translation of this genre is the story of Prince
- |2
                      Khalid and Morienos. This was completed by Robert of Chester on the
- |2
                      eleventh of February, 1144, a year after he had translated the Koran and a
- |2
                      year prior to the
- |2
                       completion of his translation of the Algebra
- |2
                      of al- Khwarizmi. The De
- |2
                          compositione alchemiae of Morienos proved to be only the
- |2
                      first of many such translations made during the following century.
- |2
                  There are frequent references to alchemy in the work of Thomas Aquinas and
- |2
                      from the commentaries on Aristotle written by Albertus Magnus it is clear
- |2
                      that the subject was of great interest to thirteenth-century scholars.
- |2
                      Albertus knew the work of Avicenna and he commented on the fact that this
- |2
                      Islamic scholar had both accepted and denied the possibility of transmuta- tion in different works ascribed
- |2
                      to him. Although Albertus believed in the truth of transmutation
- |2
                      himself, he remained skeptical of the “transmuted”
- |2
                      metals he had seen, since the artificial product had not been able to
- |2
                      withstand the heat of the fire. With Albertus we also have early evidence
- |2
                      of the application of the sulphur-mercury theory in the West. In his
- |2
                          De miner-
- |2
                      alibus he referred to the ancient concept of the ex- halations, but he went on to discuss a new
- |2
                      theory that attributed the origin of metals to sulphur and mercury.
- |2
                  Some of the most interesting medieval alchemical treatises date from the
- |2
                      late thirteenth and the early fourteenth centuries. The Pretiosa Margarita Novella of Petrus Bonus of Ferrara (ca.
- |2
                      1330) reflects the influ- ence of
- |2
                      scholasticism in its tripartite structure. Argu-
- |2
                          ments in favor of transmutation follow the initial refutations,
- |2
                      and these in turn are followed by positive answers to the objections. Peter
- |2
                      accepted transmuta- tion himself, and he
- |2
                      further stated that the true process might easily be learned in an hour. At
- |2
                      the same time he was honest enough to admit that he did not know how
- |2
                      to produce gold himself. No less influential was the Summa perfectionis which was ascribed to Jabir (Latinized as
- |2
                      Geber, late thirteenth century). As in thePrecious Pearl
- |2
                       the sulphur-mercury theory forms the theoretical basis for an
- |2
                      understanding of the metals, and the alchemist is informed that he must
- |2
                      arrange these substances (understood as ideal substances resem- bling most in nature common sulphur and
- |2
                      mercury) in perfect proportions for the consummation of the Great
- |2
                      Work. Geber described in considerable detail the laboratory processes and
- |2
                      equipment of the alchemist. This text reflects an important change in
- |2
                      distillation techniques that seems to have originated among twelfth-
- |2
                      and thirteenth-century chemists. The intro-
- |2
                          duction of condensation at this time made possible the
- |2
                      collection of low boiling fractions for the first time. As a result we find
- |2
                      in the literature of the mid-twelfth century the first reference to
- |2
                      alcohol. Geber confirms this change in equipment and procedure. He
- |2
                      described condensation apparatus in detail, and in addition he was the
- |2
                      first to give a method for the preparation of a mineral acid—our
- |2
                      nitric acid. These substances plus the mixtures of other mineral acids
- |2
                      placed powerful031
- |2
                       new reagents in the hands of alchemists who were to use them
- |2
                      regularly after this period.
- |2
                  The alchemy of the late fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries indicates an
- |2
                      increasing interest in allegorical and mystical themes. Thomas Norton's
- |2
                          Ordinall of Alchimy (1477) is little
- |2
                      concerned with clear-cut de- scriptions of
- |2
                      chemical processes or laboratory equip- ment.
- |2
                      Rather, we meet here with a lengthy poetical account of the difficult
- |2
                      nature of the work, the need of virtue for its successful conclusion, and
- |2
                      veiled de- scriptions of the true process.
- |2
                      These and similar texts were accompanied by a widespread reaction
- |2
                      against alchemy. The unsavory characterization of the alche- mist in medieval literature knows no better example
- |2
                      than Chaucer's “Canon's Yeoman's Tale” (ca. 1390)
- |2
                      while on an official level there were the decrees and statutes of Pope John
- |2
                      XXII (1317) and Henry IV of England (1404) directed against those who
- |2
                      attempted to multiply gold.
- |2
                  Closely connected with the widespread medieval interest in transmutation was
- |2
                      a parallel trend toward medical chemistry. By the fourteenth century distilla- tion and other chemical processes
- |2
                      were in use among Italian physicians as a means of identifying the dis- solved substances in the much frequented
- |2
                      mineral water spas. A century later Michael Savonarola ordered these
- |2
                      tests into a procedural form that became the basis of the later methods of
- |2
                      aqueous analyses composed by Gabriel Fallopius and Robert Boyle in the
- |2
                      sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
- |2
                  No less important was the medieval physicians' de-
- |2
                          pendence on alchemy as a source for new medicines. The Eastern
- |2
                      interest in the prolongation of life is evident here. This may be seen as
- |2
                      early as the mid- thirteenth century in
- |2
                      the work of Roger Bacon. Bacon fully accepted the truth of metallic
- |2
                      transmutation and he suggested that this might be utilized to
- |2
                      alleviate the poverty of mankind. For Bacon alchemy was a major field
- |2
                      of experimental science and he explicitly stated that one of its goals was
- |2
                      the search for a length- ened life span. In
- |2
                      the Opus tertium (1267) he com- mented that although many physicians used chemical
- |2
                      processes to prepare their medicines, very few of them knew how to make
- |2
                      metals and fewer still knew how to perform those works which led to the
- |2
                      prolongation of life.
- |2
                  The same theme occurs in the work of Bacon's younger contemporary, Arnold of
- |2
                      Villanova, who argued that alchemy must play an important role in the
- |2
                      much needed reform of medicine. In this way new remedies and the elixir of
- |2
                      life might be found. The alchemist John of Rupescissa (mid-fourteenth
- |2
                      century) insisted that the only real purpose of alchemy was to benefit
- |2
                      mankind. His works abound with medicinal preparations derived from metals
- |2
                      and minerals and he
- |2
                       emphasized distillation processes which seemingly separated
- |2
                      pure quintessences from the gross matter of the natural substances. It was
- |2
                      this medieval tradition of medical chemistry that bore fruit in the
- |2
                      Renaissance “distillation books” of Hieronymus
- |2
                      Brunschwig, Con- rad Gesner, and others who
- |2
                      looked on alchemy and chemical operations as a basic tool for the
- |2
                      preparation of medicines rather than the search for gold.

- |2
                  The work of Marsilio Ficino and his followers asso-
- |2
                          ciated with the Platonic Academy in Florence resulted in a
- |2
                      heightened interest in the mystical texts of late antiquity. Ficino himself
- |2
                      translated the Hermetic corpus (1463) and this text was of great influence
- |2
                      in the revival of Natural Magic, Astrology, and Alchemy. Interest in
- |2
                      these subjects is closely intertwined with the course of the Scientific
- |2
                      Revolution. Indeed, the sixteenth and the early seventeenth centuries
- |2
                      witnessed an ever-quickening concern with alchemy. This new interest
- |2
                      reached a peak in the middle years of the latter century before declining.
- |2
                      It was just at this time that the major collected editions of alchemical
- |2
                      classics were being prepared by Zetzner (1602, 1622, 1659-61), Ashmole
- |2
                      (1652), and Manget (1702).
- |2
                  The fresh flavor of Renaissance alchemy is perhaps best seen in the work of
- |2
                      Paracelsus (1493-1541) and his followers. The iatrochemists of the
- |2
                      sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries follow directly in the steps
- |2
                      of their medieval predecessors. Like them, they ex-
- |2
                          pressed an interest in transmutation, but they were primarily
- |2
                      concerned with the medical applications of alchemy. For some this meant the
- |2
                      preparation of chemical drugs, but for others it meant a mystical
- |2
                      alchemical approach to medicine that might apply to macrocosmic as well as
- |2
                      to microcosmic phenomena.
- |2
                  Paracelsus may be characterized as one of the many nature philosophers of
- |2
                      his time, but he differs from others in his emphasis on the importance of
- |2
                      medicine and alchemy as bases for a new understanding of the universe.
- |2
                      Characteristic of the Paracelsians was their firm opposition to the
- |2
                      dominant Aristotelian-Galenic tradition of the universities. They were
- |2
                      unyielding in their opposition to Scholasticism which they sought to
- |2
                      replace with a philosophy influenced by the recently translated
- |2
                      Neo-Platonic and Hermetic texts. The reli-
- |2
                      gious nature of their quest is ever present. Man was to seek an
- |2
                      understanding of his Creator through the two books of divine revelation;
- |2
                      the Holy Scriptures and the Book of Creation—Nature. The
- |2
                      Paracelsians constantly called for a new observational approach to
- |2
                      nature, and for them chemistry or alchemy seemed to be the best example of
- |2
                      what this new science should be. The Paracelsians were quick to offer an alchemical032
- |2
                       interpretation of Genesis. Here they pictured the Cre- ation as the work of a divine alchemist
- |2
                      separating the beings and objects of the earth and the heavens from
- |2
                      the unformed prima materia much as the alchemist
- |2
                      may distill pure quintessence from a grosser form of matter.
- |2
                  The search for physical truth in the biblical account of the Creation
- |2
                      focused special attention on the forma- tion
- |2
                      of the elements. Paracelsus regularly used the Aristotelian elements, but
- |2
                      he also introduced the tria
- |2
                      prima—the principles of Salt. Sulphur, and Mercury.
- |2
                      The latter were a modification of the old sulphur- mercury theory of the metals, but they differed
- |2
                      from the older concept in that they were to apply to all things rather
- |2
                      than being limited to the metals alone. The introduction of these
- |2
                      principles had the effect of calling into question the whole framework of
- |2
                      ancient medicine and natural philosophy since these had been grounded
- |2
                      upon the Aristotelian elements. Furthermore, the fact that Paracelsus had
- |2
                      not clearly defined his principles tended to make the whole question of
- |2
                          ele- mentary substances an ill-defined
- |2
                      one.
- |2
                  The Paracelsians sought to interpret their world in terms of alchemy or
- |2
                      chemistry. On the macrocosmic level they spoke of meteorological events in
- |2
                      terms of chemical analogies. On the geocosmic level they argued over
- |2
                      differing chemical interpretations of the growth of minerals and the origin
- |2
                      of mountain springs. And in their search for agricultural improvements
- |2
                      they postulated the importance of dissolved salts as the reason for
- |2
                      the beneficial result of fertilizing with manure. For them this was the
- |2
                      familiar universal salt of the alchemists.
- |2
                  The Paracelsians approached medicine in a similar fashion. They felt assured
- |2
                      that their knowledge of the macrocosm might be properly applied to the
- |2
                          micro- cosm. Thus, if an aerial sulphur
- |2
                      and niter were the cause of thunder and lightning in the heavens, the
- |2
                      same aerial effluvia might be inhaled and generate burning diseases in
- |2
                      the body. Similarly, chemical deposits were formed when the internal archei
- |2
                      governing the various organs failed to properly eliminate impurities from
- |2
                      the system.
- |2
                  The Renaissance was a period of new and violent diseases and the chemical
- |2
                      physicians stated that their new stronger remedies were essential for the
- |2
                      proper cures. The work of Paracelsus is reminiscent of medie- val distillation chemistry, but by the end of the
- |2
                      century iatrochemists were turning less to distilled quintes- sences and more to precipitates and
- |2
                      residues in their search for new remedies. In all cases it was argued
- |2
                      that alchemical procedures resulted in the separation of pure substances
- |2
                      from inactive impurities.
- |2
                  In the century between 1550 and 1650 conflicts between Paracelsian
- |2
                      iatrochemists and more traditional
- |2
                       Galenists were common. The detailed critique of the Paracelsian
- |2
                      position by Thomas Erastus became a fun-
- |2
                      damental text for those who opposed the chemical medicine, and a
- |2
                      sharp confrontation between chemists and Galenists followed in Paris in the
- |2
                      first decade of the seventeenth century. Here the debate centered
- |2
                      largely around the possible dangers of the new med-
- |2
                          icines. Both Andreas Libavius and Daniel Sennert re- viewed this controversy and concluded that the best
- |2
                      course for physicians would be to accept the useful remedies of both the
- |2
                      old and the new systems. This was the compromise position taken by the
- |2
                      compilers of the Pharmacopoeia of the Royal College
- |2
                      of Physi- cians of London (1618) and after
- |2
                      this time there were few who denied the value of chemistry for medicine.
- |2
                  Yet, if the chemists debated with more traditional philosophers and
- |2
                      physicians, they disagreed no less among themselves. At the opening of the
- |2
                      seventeenth century Robert Fludd defended the chemically oriented
- |2
                      views of the Rosicrucians and he described his mystical alchemical
- |2
                      interpretation of nature and supernature in a series of folio volumes on
- |2
                      the macro- cosm and the microcosm. Here he
- |2
                      placed considerable emphasis on an alchemical interpretation of the Crea- tion and he utilized mechanical examples to
- |2
                      support his views. His work gave support to the alchemical plea for a
- |2
                      new science and it was viewed with alarm by Johannes Kepler, Marin
- |2
                      Mersenne, and Pierre Gassendi.
- |2
                  Jean Baptiste van Helmont was no less a chemical philosopher than Fludd, and
- |2
                      he described in detail his transmutation of mercury to gold by means of a
- |2
                      small sample of the philosopher's stone. Van Helmont sought a chemical
- |2
                      understanding of man through medicine, but, in contrast to Fludd and most
- |2
                      Paracelsians, he rejected the macrocosm-microcosm analogy. Van Helmont
- |2
                      thus was less interested in macrocosmic and geocosmic phenomena than Fludd
- |2
                      and he concentrated more on practical and theoretical medical
- |2
                      questions. The influence of both authors was considerable in an age
- |2
                      when great uncertainty existed about the future course of the new science.
- |2
                      As late as 1650 John French could still suggest that only chemistry should
- |2
                      properly be considered the basis for a reform of the universities.
- |2
                      Similarly John Webster (1654) stated that the new learning must be grounded
- |2
                      principally upon the works of Francis Bacon and Robert Fludd.

- |2
                  If the chemical philosophy seemed a plausible alter-

                          native to the work of the mechanical philosophers in the middle
- |2
                      decades of the seventeenth century, this alternative did not remain a

- |2
                      And yet, this is not to say that alchemical thought died after a final
- |2
                      flowering in the sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries. The collection of

                      manuscripts at King's Col- lege, Cambridge
- |2
                      leaves little doubt that Isaac Newton was passionately concerned with the

                      traditional prob- lems of transmutation.

                      Furthermore, recent research indicates that Newton's alchemical
- |2
                      speculations may have been instrumental in the crystallization of some
- |2
                      of his more acceptable concepts of physics. Similarly, Robert Boyle was
- |2
                      influenced by alchemical thought. He published on the degradation of silver
- |2
                      and his theoretical views were strongly influenced by his early
- |2
                      reading of van Helmont. However, it is possible to go beyond these
- |2
                      examples. Alchemical works were written by the important practical chemist,
- |2
                      Johann Rudolf Glauber and the medical chemistry of the Renaissance
- |2
                      alchemists found a new proponent in the revision of Franciscus Sylvius de
- |2
                      la Böe whose work went through numerous seventeenth- and
- |2
                      eighteenth-century edi- tions. In like manner
- |2
                      many elements of Paracelsian chemistry were retained in somewhat altered
- |2
                      form in the texts of the eighteenth-century phlogiston chemists. At
- |2
                      the same time the German revival of alchemy and Rosicrucianism stimulated a
- |2
                      new interest in earlier interpretations of a vitalistic and mystically
- |2
                      oriented universe. The impact of this on the growth of the
- |2
                      nineteenth-century Naturphilosophie has yet to be as- sessed.
- |2
                  Many characteristic themes of alchemical thought and style are present in
- |2
                      the earliest texts that have survived. Both the secrecy and the practical
- |2
                      recipes of the metallic craft tradition are evident in the works of
- |2
                      the late Hellenistic authors dating from the late third and the fourth
- |2
                      centuries A.D. The allegorical and sym-
- |2
                      bolical style of later alchemical works is also present here, and
- |2
                      this is a reflection of the mystical tenor of the current philosophies and
- |2
                      religions of the late Em- pire. The medical theme
- |2
                      is absent in the Greek tradi- tion and this
- |2
                      seems to have been derived from Eastern sources. First found in Chinese
- |2
                      alchemical works em- phasizing the
- |2
                      lengthening of life and the search for immortality, medical alchemy was
- |2
                      integrated first into Islamic and then into Western alchemy and medicine.
- |2
                  There is little doubt that alchemy, understood in its broadest sense as a
- |2
                      chemical key to nature, played a significant role in the development of the
- |2
                      Scientific Revolution. The claim that this mystical science should
- |2
                      replace the Aristotelianism and Galenism of the schools was looked on with
- |2
                      dismay by early seventeenth- century
- |2
                      mechanists who were forced to clarify their
- |2
                       own views in their attacks on authors such as Paracelsus and
- |2
                      Robert Fludd. At the same time, however, the chemical and alchemical call
- |2
                      for a new science based on new observations in nature was important in
- |2
                      a period that witnessed an ever-lessening adherence to scholastic
- |2
                      authority. Finally, the Paracelsian and iatro-
- |2
                          chemical adoption of the primary goal of the medical alchemy of
- |2
                      the Middle Ages resulted in the permanent acceptance of chemistry as a
- |2
                      legitimate tool of the physician and the pharmacist.

               Dictionary of the History of IdeasThe alchemy of the sixteenth and the seventeenth
- |2
                      centuries represents a fusion of many seemingly dis-
- |2
                          parate themes derived from ancient and medieval Near and Far
- |2
                      Eastern sources. A simple definition is difficult if not impossible. The
- |2
                      alchemists always maintained
- |2
                       a special interest in the changes of matter and surely most of
- |2
                      them accepted the concept of transmutation, but there were other
- |2
                      significant strains evident in al- chemical
- |2
                      thought as well. Important among these was the early and persistent belief
- |2
                      that the study of alchemy had a special role in medicine through the
- |2
                      preparation of remedies and the search for the prolongation of life.
- |2
                      In addition to this was the belief that alchemy was the fundamental science
- |2
                      for the investigation of nature. And yet, if the alchemists spoke
- |2
                      repeatedly of experi- ence and observation as
- |2
                      the true keys to nature, they also maintained a fervent belief in a
- |2
                      universe unified through the relationship of the macrocosm and the
- |2
                      microcosm—a relationship that of necessity tied this science to
- |2
                      astrology. The alchemists were convinced further that their search for the
- |2
                      truths of nature might be conceived in terms of a religious quest which
- |2
                      would result in a greater knowledge of the Creator. It is not
- |2
                      surprising then to find a late sixteenth-century author defining medicine
- |2
                      as “the searching out of the secretes of nature,” a
- |2
                      goal that was to be accomplished by resort to “mathematicall and
- |2
                      supernaturall precepts, the ex- ercise whereof
- |2
                      is Mechanicall, and to be accomplished with labor.” Having thus
- |2
                      defined medicine, he went on to state that the real name of this art was
- |2
                      simply chemistry or alchemy (Bostocke, 1585).In short, while few would deny that there were elements of modern science in
- |2
                      alchemy, it is also true that this was a study permeated with a
- |2
                      mysticism foreign to the post-Newtonian world.The difficulty in dating alchemical texts has resulted in a long-standing
- |2
                      controversy over its origins. Yet, if the priority of Near Eastern, Indian,
- |2
                      and Chinese al- chemists remains in dispute,
- |2
                      there is general agreement among scholars that the student in search of the
- |2
                      roots of alchemy must be concerned not only with early concepts of
- |2
                      nature, but also with the practical craft traditions of antiquity. The
- |2
                      oldest surviving works of metal craftsmen combine an emphasis on the
- |2
                      change in the appearance of metals with the acceptance of a vitalistic
- |2
                      view of nature—a view that included the belief that metals live
- |2
                      and grow within the earth in a fashion analogous to the growth of a human
- |2
                      fetus. It was to become fundamental to alchemical thought that the
- |2
                      operator might hasten the natural process of metallic growth in his
- |2
                      laboratory and thus bring about perfection in a period of time far less
- |2
                      than that required by nature.Several texts point to the existence of a practical proto-alchemical
- |2
                      literature in the ancient Near East. The recent study of two Babylonian
- |2
                      tablets (Oppen- heim, 1966) dating from the
- |2
                      thirteenth century B.C.Alexandrian alchemy was based on Greek philosophy as well as on the
- |2
                      practical tradition of the craftsmen. The early comparisons of man and
- |2
                      nature found in the pre-Socratics and in Plato's Timaeus fostered an inter- est in the
- |2
                      relationship of the macrocosm and the microcosm, a doctrine which played a
- |2
                      major role in alchemical thought well into the seventeenth century.
- |2
                      Systems of intermediary beings and the pneuma were
- |2
                      employed by the Stoics, the Neo-Platonists, and other philosophical sects
- |2
                      in antiquity to provide connecting links between the two worlds.Also important for the development of alchemical thought was the long
- |2
                      tradition of speculation on the Creation. The philosopher interested in
- |2
                      both the Crea- tion and Nature was inevitably
- |2
                      drawn to the question of the origin of the elements and the possibility of aprima materia. The views of the pre-Socratics on
- |2
                      the prime matter formed a springboard from which later authors
- |2
                      launched their own concepts. Thus Aristotle conveniently summarized the
- |2
                      views of his predecessors prior to refuting them in his Metaphysics. However, the subject was one of no less importance
- |2
                      to him than it had been to them. Aristotle accepted the four
- |2
                      Empedoclean elements (earth, air, water, and fire) with their attendant
- |2
                      qualities and he believed that they were mutually transmutable.The genesis of the elements also forms an important section of Plato's Timaeus where the subject is devel- oped mathematically, but to alchemical authors of
- |2
                      late antiquity who were influenced by Neo-Platonic, Gnos- tic, and Christian sources, the accounts found in Gene
- |2
                      sis and the Pymander attributed to Hermes
- |2
                          Trisme- gistus were no less
- |2
                      significant. Surely the alchemical literature was stamped with a
- |2
                      Creation-element theme throughout its existence. In the sixteenth and
- |2
                      the seventeenth centuries chemical authors still focused on the
- |2
                      elements in their defense or attack of any given system. An important
- |2
                      example may be found in Ger- hard Dorn's defense
- |2
                      of the Paracelsians which he based on an analysis of the
- |2
                      “Physics of Genesis” and the “Physics of
- |2
                      Hermes.” Similarly Robert Boyle placed special emphasis on the
- |2
                      problem of the elements in his criticism of the Aristotelians and the
- |2
                      Paracelsian chemists in the Sceptical Chymist
- |2
                      (1661).The earliest true alchemical texts in Greek date from the end of the third
- |2
                      century A.D. These are clearly connected with the earlier practical
- |2
                      tradition as well as with current philosophical and religious thought.
- |2
                      Two of the more important authors are Zosimos, author of the encyclopedic
- |2
                          Cheirokmeta, whose work links these alchemical
- |2
                      texts with the book of Bolos Demo- critos,
- |2
                      and Maria the Jewess, whose text is significant for its detailed
- |2
                      description of the laboratory equipment of the Alexandrian alchemist. The
- |2
                      latter work indicates that the emphasis on distillation and sublimation
- |2
                          proc- esses—still so pronounced
- |2
                      in the Renaissance—was already characteristic of alchemical
- |2
                      recipes in late antiquity. These Alexandrian texts are openly con- cerned with transmutation. The processes
- |2
                      given stress color change as a guide to progress—from black
- |2
                      to white to yellow to violet. The sequence was clearly associated with
- |2
                      the change from a chaotic and un- defined
- |2
                      primal matter to metallic perfection. And al-
- |2
                      though the final stage was eventually to be changed from violet to
- |2
                      red, the emphasis on color was to remain a basic theme in descriptions of
- |2
                      the Great Work.Although practical recipes form part of these third-
- |2
                          and fourth-century texts there is also present in them a
- |2
                      pronounced interest in secrecy and mysticism. Alle-
- |2
                          gorical dream sequences form part of this literature, and the
- |2
                      role of spirits is considered important in the transformation of matter.
- |2
                      And while one may extract some scientific information from the Greek
- |2
                      alchemical codices, he will find it difficult to separate this
- |2
                      material from the ever-present religious aura that pervades these
- |2
                      works. An example may be seen in the analogous treat-
- |2
                          ment of metals and mankind. Because of the truth of this it was
- |2
                      felt that the operator might follow the death and resurrection theme as he
- |2
                      pursued his work. It was this aspect of alchemical thought that dominates
- |2
                      the later Greek texts. The work of Stephanos (ca. 610-41) is replete
- |2
                      with prayers, invocations, and allegorical descriptions. There is little
- |2
                      indication here that the alchemist still had close personal contact with
- |2
                      the laboratory. The text of Stephanos was highly influentialAlthough Pliny and Dioscorides refer to mineral substances of medical value,
- |2
                      Hellenistic alchemical texts do not indicate any real concern with pharma- ceutical chemistry. This is in
- |2
                      marked contrast with the development of alchemy in China and India. As
- |2
                      early as the eighth century B.C. there was a belief in physical
- |2
                      immortality in China, and this was later to become closely associated with
- |2
                      Taoist thought. A text from the second century B.C. refers to the
- |2
                      transmutation of cinnabar to gold and within a few hundred years the
- |2
                      concept of longevity was to be clearly connected with chemically prepared
- |2
                      drugs and elixirs. This is evident in the Nei P'ien
- |2
                      of Ko Hung (ca. A.D. 320) which was to become a standard Chinese text on
- |2
                      this subject. In it will be found sections on the transmutation of
- |2
                      metals and on elixirs of life—and all this mixed with rules
- |2
                      for the attainment of long life and immortality. Chinese alchemy paralleled
- |2
                      Alexandrian alchemy in its frequent reference to the macrocosm-microcosm
- |2
                      analogy as well as in the development of both esoteric and exoteric
- |2
                      approaches to this subject. Thus, while the Chinese alchemist sought a
- |2
                      potable gold and various chemically prepared drugs in his quest for
- |2
                      longevity and immor- tality, the texts also
- |2
                      indicate a real interest in alchemy as the search for the inner perfection
- |2
                      of the soul.From India the Sanskrit Atharva Veda (perhaps as
- |2
                      early as the eighth century B.C.) refers to the use of gold as a means of
- |2
                      preserving life, and there are other early texts relating gold to
- |2
                      immortality. Buddhist texts of the second to the fifth centuries A.D.
- |2
                      discuss the transmutation of base metals to gold by means of a juice
- |2
                      concocted from vegetable and mineral sources. The still later tantric-Hatha
- |2
                      yoga texts (post-eighth century) show the same trend toward increased mys- ticism already noted in the Greek and the
- |2
                      Chinese sources. Here the operator undergoes the experience of an
- |2
                      initiatory death and this is followed by a resur-
- |2
                          rection. In metals the result may be seen in the perfec- tion of gold—in man, the
- |2
                      alchemist induces in his own person a similar separation of spirit from
- |2
                      gross matter. In this case the result is a perfected person with an
- |2
                      infinitely prolonged youth.Similarities between Chinese and Indian alchemy have long led to
- |2
                      speculations regarding the possible transmission of common concepts. To
- |2
                      date, however, few facts have come to light to substantiate these
- |2
                       speculations. The origins of Islamic alchemy are some- what easier to discern. Here there is
- |2
                      little question about the importance of Greek sources. Traditionally
- |2
                      Prince Khalid ibn Yazid (d. 704) was the first Muslim convert to alchemy
- |2
                      and it is significant that his teacher was said to be one Morienos, a pupil
- |2
                      of the legendary Stephanos of Alexandria. Although there is little likeli- hood of truth in this story, the strong
- |2
                      Greek influence on Islamic alchemy may be further confirmed by fre- quent references to Alexandrian authors and
- |2
                      the gen- eral use of Greek philosophical
- |2
                      concepts. Translations were made into Arabic at learned centers
- |2
                      throughout the Near East not only of the works of such major figures
- |2
                      as Aristotle, Galen, and Ptolemy, but also of Zosimos, Bolos Democritos,
- |2
                      and Stephanos. Among these centers the old Sassanian academy at Jundi- Shapur played a role. Similarly a
- |2
                      group of Sabians at Harran were influential in transmitting Indian alchemi- cal and astrological thought into the
- |2
                      Islamic tradition.The ascription of alchemical works to earlier authors was as common to
- |2
                      Islamic authors as it had been to their Greek predecessors. The short
- |2
                      alchemical classic, the “Emerald Table,” was said to
- |2
                      have been written by Hermes Trismegistus, but the earliest surviving
- |2
                      version is in an early ninth-century Arabic text ascribed to the
- |2
                      first-century (A.D.) magician, Apollonios of Tyana. A similar problem
- |2
                      exists in regard to the Turba philosophorum.
- |2
                      This exists only in Latin, but it has been shown by E. J. Holmyard and J.
- |2
                      Ruska to have been composed originally in Arabic early in the tenth cen- tury. The dialogue form is used in the Turba and the speakers are supposedly the Greek
- |2
                      philosophers of an- tiquity. Islamic alchemy
- |2
                      did not confine itself to Greek sages and gods alone in this regard. The
- |2
                      eighth-century scholar, Jabir-ibn-Hayyan, probably authored only a few
- |2
                      works on alchemy. However, some two thousand titles are ascribed to him.
- |2
                      The great bulk of these seem to derive from members of the Isma'ilya sect,
- |2
                      the Brotherhood of Purity, and they date from the ninth and the tenth
- |2
                      centuries.Islamic alchemy is characterized by both the practi-
- |2
                          cal and the mystical elements seen in the earlier Greek texts.
- |2
                      There are frequent warnings that the information being revealed is for the
- |2
                      initiated alone and there is a continued use of the allegorical approach
- |2
                      which had become common in late Greek works. The religious nature of
- |2
                      the art is emphasized and the predominant vitalism favored by alchemical
- |2
                      authors may be seen in discussions of the generation of metals, and in
- |2
                      the sexual interpretation of fundamental stages of the great work. As
- |2
                      in the Alexandrian texts the progress of the operator may be followed
- |2
                      through the now standard sequence of color changes. The concept of the
- |2
                          philoso- pher's stone is also well
- |2
                      developed in the Arabic litera-Aristotelian element theory is commonly employed in the Arabic texts, but in
- |2
                      addition the Jabirian works employed the Sulphur-Mercury theory of the
- |2
                      metals. This concept suggests that all metals are composed of
- |2
                      different proportions of a sophic sulphur and a sophic mercury. While there
- |2
                      was general agreement that these two substances have a resemblance to
- |2
                      common sulphur and mercury, it was asserted that they were much purer
- |2
                      than anything that could be produced in the laboratory. A quantitative
- |2
                      relationship between the two was implied, but the mathematical
- |2
                      relationship expressed in these texts may be most easily related to
- |2
                      the number mysticism favored by the Neo-Pythago- reans and Eastern mystics. Although the Sulphur- Mercury theory appears first in
- |2
                      this literature, it seems to be a modification of the concept of the two
- |2
                          exhala- tions within the earth that lead
- |2
                      to the formation of minerals and metals. This concept is discussed in
- |2
                      the fourth book of Aristotle's Meteorologica.In the Arabic literature the reader finds an emphasis on medical chemistry
- |2
                      for the first time outside of the Far East and India. The work of the
- |2
                      physician al-Razi (Rhazes, 860-925) is decidedly practical in nature.
- |2
                      Although he accepted the truth of transmutation and discussed elixirs of
- |2
                      varying powers, in the Book of the Secret of Secrets
- |2
                      Razi spoke at length of chemical equipment and he described in detail the
- |2
                      laboratory operations requisite for the chemist. In addition he
- |2
                      described a large number of laboratory reagents and classified them into
- |2
                      the categories of “animal,” “min- eral,”
- |2
                      “vegetable,” and “derivative.”
- |2
                      Chemical texts continued to employ the first three of these as a basic
- |2
                      scheme for arrangement until well into the eighteenth century. Razi's
- |2
                      interest in medicine and practical chemistry influenced later Islamic work
- |2
                      in medical chemistry. The work of ibn-Sina (Avicenna, 980-1037) and
- |2
                      Abu Mansur Muwaffak (late tenth century) indi-
- |2
                      cates a special interest in chemically prepared sub- stances of pharmaceutical value.Western alchemy developed from Arabic sources. As Islamic scholars had
- |2
                      sought alchemical texts in the eighth century, so their Latin counterparts
- |2
                      sought sim- ilar works four centuries later. The
- |2
                      earliest dated Latin translation of this genre is the story of Prince
- |2
                      Khalid and Morienos. This was completed by Robert of Chester on the
- |2
                      eleventh of February, 1144, a year after he had translated the Koran and a
- |2
                      year prior to the
- |2
                       completion of his translation of the Algebra
- |2
                      of al- Khwarizmi. The De
- |2
                          compositione alchemiae of Morienos proved to be only the
- |2
                      first of many such translations made during the following century.There are frequent references to alchemy in the work of Thomas Aquinas and
- |2
                      from the commentaries on Aristotle written by Albertus Magnus it is clear
- |2
                      that the subject was of great interest to thirteenth-century scholars.
- |2
                      Albertus knew the work of Avicenna and he commented on the fact that this
- |2
                      Islamic scholar had both accepted and denied the possibility of transmuta- tion in different works ascribed
- |2
                      to him. Although Albertus believed in the truth of transmutation
- |2
                      himself, he remained skeptical of the “transmuted”
- |2
                      metals he had seen, since the artificial product had not been able to
- |2
                      withstand the heat of the fire. With Albertus we also have early evidence
- |2
                      of the application of the sulphur-mercury theory in the West. In his
- |2
                          De miner-
- |2
                      alibus he referred to the ancient concept of the ex- halations, but he went on to discuss a new
- |2
                      theory that attributed the origin of metals to sulphur and mercury.Some of the most interesting medieval alchemical treatises date from the
- |2
                      late thirteenth and the early fourteenth centuries. The Pretiosa Margarita Novella of Petrus Bonus of Ferrara (ca.
- |2
                      1330) reflects the influ- ence of
- |2
                      scholasticism in its tripartite structure. Argu-
- |2
                          ments in favor of transmutation follow the initial refutations,
- |2
                      and these in turn are followed by positive answers to the objections. Peter
- |2
                      accepted transmuta- tion himself, and he
- |2
                      further stated that the true process might easily be learned in an hour. At
- |2
                      the same time he was honest enough to admit that he did not know how
- |2
                      to produce gold himself. No less influential was the Summa perfectionis which was ascribed to Jabir (Latinized as
- |2
                      Geber, late thirteenth century). As in thePrecious Pearl
- |2
                       the sulphur-mercury theory forms the theoretical basis for an
- |2
                      understanding of the metals, and the alchemist is informed that he must
- |2
                      arrange these substances (understood as ideal substances resem- bling most in nature common sulphur and
- |2
                      mercury) in perfect proportions for the consummation of the Great
- |2
                      Work. Geber described in considerable detail the laboratory processes and
- |2
                      equipment of the alchemist. This text reflects an important change in
- |2
                      distillation techniques that seems to have originated among twelfth-
- |2
                      and thirteenth-century chemists. The intro-
- |2
                          duction of condensation at this time made possible the
- |2
                      collection of low boiling fractions for the first time. As a result we find
- |2
                      in the literature of the mid-twelfth century the first reference to
- |2
                      alcohol. Geber confirms this change in equipment and procedure. He
- |2
                      described condensation apparatus in detail, and in addition he was the
- |2
                      first to give a method for the preparation of a mineral acid—our
- |2
                      nitric acid. These substances plus the mixtures of other mineral acids

                      placed powerfulThe alchemy of the late fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries indicates an
- |2
                      increasing interest in allegorical and mystical themes. Thomas Norton's
- |2
                          Ordinall of Alchimy (1477) is little
- |2
                      concerned with clear-cut de- scriptions of

- |2
                      Rather, we meet here with a lengthy poetical account of the difficult
- |2
                      nature of the work, the need of virtue for its successful conclusion, and
- |2
                      veiled de- scriptions of the true process.
- |2
                      These and similar texts were accompanied by a widespread reaction
- |2
                      against alchemy. The unsavory characterization of the alche- mist in medieval literature knows no better example
- |2
                      than Chaucer's “Canon's Yeoman's Tale” (ca. 1390)
- |2
                      while on an official level there were the decrees and statutes of Pope John
- |2
                      XXII (1317) and Henry IV of England (1404) directed against those who
- |2
                      attempted to multiply gold.Closely connected with the widespread medieval interest in transmutation was
- |2
                      a parallel trend toward medical chemistry. By the fourteenth century distilla- tion and other chemical processes
- |2
                      were in use among Italian physicians as a means of identifying the dis- solved substances in the much frequented
- |2
                      mineral water spas. A century later Michael Savonarola ordered these
- |2
                      tests into a procedural form that became the basis of the later methods of
- |2
                      aqueous analyses composed by Gabriel Fallopius and Robert Boyle in the
- |2
                      sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.No less important was the medieval physicians' de-
- |2
                          pendence on alchemy as a source for new medicines. The Eastern
- |2
                      interest in the prolongation of life is evident here. This may be seen as
- |2
                      early as the mid- thirteenth century in
- |2
                      the work of Roger Bacon. Bacon fully accepted the truth of metallic
- |2
                      transmutation and he suggested that this might be utilized to
- |2
                      alleviate the poverty of mankind. For Bacon alchemy was a major field
- |2
                      of experimental science and he explicitly stated that one of its goals was
- |2
                      the search for a length- ened life span. In
- |2
                      the Opus tertium (1267) he com- mented that although many physicians used chemical
- |2
                      processes to prepare their medicines, very few of them knew how to make
- |2
                      metals and fewer still knew how to perform those works which led to the
- |2
                      prolongation of life.The same theme occurs in the work of Bacon's younger contemporary, Arnold of
- |2
                      Villanova, who argued that alchemy must play an important role in the
- |2
                      much needed reform of medicine. In this way new remedies and the elixir of
- |2
                      life might be found. The alchemist John of Rupescissa (mid-fourteenth
- |2
                      century) insisted that the only real purpose of alchemy was to benefit
- |2
                      mankind. His works abound with medicinal preparations derived from metals
- |2
                      and minerals and he
- |2
                       emphasized distillation processes which seemingly separated
- |2
                      pure quintessences from the gross matter of the natural substances. It was
- |2
                      this medieval tradition of medical chemistry that bore fruit in the
- |2
                      Renaissance “distillation books” of Hieronymus
- |2
                      Brunschwig, Con- rad Gesner, and others who
- |2
                      looked on alchemy and chemical operations as a basic tool for the
- |2
                      preparation of medicines rather than the search for gold.The work of Marsilio Ficino and his followers asso-
- |2
                          ciated with the Platonic Academy in Florence resulted in a
- |2
                      heightened interest in the mystical texts of late antiquity. Ficino himself
- |2
                      translated the Hermetic corpus (1463) and this text was of great influence
- |2
                      in the revival of Natural Magic, Astrology, and Alchemy. Interest in
- |2
                      these subjects is closely intertwined with the course of the Scientific
- |2
                      Revolution. Indeed, the sixteenth and the early seventeenth centuries
- |2
                      witnessed an ever-quickening concern with alchemy. This new interest
- |2
                      reached a peak in the middle years of the latter century before declining.
- |2
                      It was just at this time that the major collected editions of alchemical
- |2
                      classics were being prepared by Zetzner (1602, 1622, 1659-61), Ashmole
- |2
                      (1652), and Manget (1702).The fresh flavor of Renaissance alchemy is perhaps best seen in the work of
- |2
                      Paracelsus (1493-1541) and his followers. The iatrochemists of the
- |2
                      sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries follow directly in the steps
- |2
                      of their medieval predecessors. Like them, they ex-
- |2
                          pressed an interest in transmutation, but they were primarily
- |2
                      concerned with the medical applications of alchemy. For some this meant the
- |2
                      preparation of chemical drugs, but for others it meant a mystical
- |2
                      alchemical approach to medicine that might apply to macrocosmic as well as
- |2
                      to microcosmic phenomena.Paracelsus may be characterized as one of the many nature philosophers of
- |2
                      his time, but he differs from others in his emphasis on the importance of
- |2
                      medicine and alchemy as bases for a new understanding of the universe.
- |2
                      Characteristic of the Paracelsians was their firm opposition to the
- |2
                      dominant Aristotelian-Galenic tradition of the universities. They were
- |2
                      unyielding in their opposition to Scholasticism which they sought to
- |2
                      replace with a philosophy influenced by the recently translated
- |2
                      Neo-Platonic and Hermetic texts. The reli-
- |2
                      gious nature of their quest is ever present. Man was to seek an
- |2
                      understanding of his Creator through the two books of divine revelation;
- |2
                      the Holy Scriptures and the Book of Creation—Nature. The
- |2
                      Paracelsians constantly called for a new observational approach to
- |2
                      nature, and for them chemistry or alchemy seemed to be the best example of
- |2
                      what this new science should be. The Paracelsians were quick to offer an alchemicalThe search for physical truth in the biblical account of the Creation
- |2
                      focused special attention on the forma- tion
- |2
                      of the elements. Paracelsus regularly used the Aristotelian elements, but
- |2
                      he also introduced the tria
- |2
                      prima—the principles of Salt. Sulphur, and Mercury.
- |2
                      The latter were a modification of the old sulphur- mercury theory of the metals, but they differed
- |2
                      from the older concept in that they were to apply to all things rather
- |2
                      than being limited to the metals alone. The introduction of these
- |2
                      principles had the effect of calling into question the whole framework of
- |2
                      ancient medicine and natural philosophy since these had been grounded
- |2
                      upon the Aristotelian elements. Furthermore, the fact that Paracelsus had
- |2
                      not clearly defined his principles tended to make the whole question of
- |2
                          ele- mentary substances an ill-defined
- |2
                      one.The Paracelsians sought to interpret their world in terms of alchemy or
- |2
                      chemistry. On the macrocosmic level they spoke of meteorological events in
- |2
                      terms of chemical analogies. On the geocosmic level they argued over
- |2
                      differing chemical interpretations of the growth of minerals and the origin
- |2
                      of mountain springs. And in their search for agricultural improvements
- |2
                      they postulated the importance of dissolved salts as the reason for
- |2
                      the beneficial result of fertilizing with manure. For them this was the
- |2
                      familiar universal salt of the alchemists.The Paracelsians approached medicine in a similar fashion. They felt assured
- |2
                      that their knowledge of the macrocosm might be properly applied to the
- |2
                          micro- cosm. Thus, if an aerial sulphur
- |2
                      and niter were the cause of thunder and lightning in the heavens, the
- |2
                      same aerial effluvia might be inhaled and generate burning diseases in
- |2
                      the body. Similarly, chemical deposits were formed when the internal archei
- |2
                      governing the various organs failed to properly eliminate impurities from
- |2
                      the system.The Renaissance was a period of new and violent diseases and the chemical
- |2
                      physicians stated that their new stronger remedies were essential for the
- |2
                      proper cures. The work of Paracelsus is reminiscent of medie- val distillation chemistry, but by the end of the
- |2
                      century iatrochemists were turning less to distilled quintes- sences and more to precipitates and
- |2
                      residues in their search for new remedies. In all cases it was argued
- |2
                      that alchemical procedures resulted in the separation of pure substances
- |2
                      from inactive impurities.In the century between 1550 and 1650 conflicts between Paracelsian
- |2
                      iatrochemists and more traditional
- |2
                       Galenists were common. The detailed critique of the Paracelsian
- |2
                      position by Thomas Erastus became a fun-
- |2
                      damental text for those who opposed the chemical medicine, and a
- |2
                      sharp confrontation between chemists and Galenists followed in Paris in the
- |2
                      first decade of the seventeenth century. Here the debate centered
- |2
                      largely around the possible dangers of the new med-
- |2
                          icines. Both Andreas Libavius and Daniel Sennert re- viewed this controversy and concluded that the best
- |2
                      course for physicians would be to accept the useful remedies of both the
- |2
                      old and the new systems. This was the compromise position taken by the
- |2
                      compilers of the Pharmacopoeia of the Royal College
- |2
                      of Physi- cians of London (1618) and after
- |2
                      this time there were few who denied the value of chemistry for medicine.Yet, if the chemists debated with more traditional philosophers and
- |2
                      physicians, they disagreed no less among themselves. At the opening of the
- |2
                      seventeenth century Robert Fludd defended the chemically oriented
- |2
                      views of the Rosicrucians and he described his mystical alchemical
- |2
                      interpretation of nature and supernature in a series of folio volumes on
- |2
                      the macro- cosm and the microcosm. Here he
- |2
                      placed considerable emphasis on an alchemical interpretation of the Crea- tion and he utilized mechanical examples to
- |2
                      support his views. His work gave support to the alchemical plea for a
- |2
                      new science and it was viewed with alarm by Johannes Kepler, Marin
- |2
                      Mersenne, and Pierre Gassendi.Jean Baptiste van Helmont was no less a chemical philosopher than Fludd, and
- |2
                      he described in detail his transmutation of mercury to gold by means of a
- |2
                      small sample of the philosopher's stone. Van Helmont sought a chemical
- |2
                      understanding of man through medicine, but, in contrast to Fludd and most
- |2
                      Paracelsians, he rejected the macrocosm-microcosm analogy. Van Helmont
- |2
                      thus was less interested in macrocosmic and geocosmic phenomena than Fludd
- |2
                      and he concentrated more on practical and theoretical medical
- |2
                      questions. The influence of both authors was considerable in an age
- |2
                      when great uncertainty existed about the future course of the new science.
- |2
                      As late as 1650 John French could still suggest that only chemistry should
- |2
                      properly be considered the basis for a reform of the universities.
- |2
                      Similarly John Webster (1654) stated that the new learning must be grounded
- |2
                      principally upon the works of Francis Bacon and Robert Fludd.If the chemical philosophy seemed a plausible alter-
- |2
                          native to the work of the mechanical philosophers in the middle
- |2
                      decades of the seventeenth century, this alternative did not remain a
- |2
                      viable one for long. The impressive results of the

- |2
                      the earliest texts that have survived. Both the secrecy and the practical
- |2
                      recipes of the metallic craft tradition are evident in the works of
- |2
                      the late Hellenistic authors dating from the late third and the fourth
- |2
                      centuries A.D. The allegorical and sym-
- |2
                      bolical style of later alchemical works is also present here, and
- |2
                      this is a reflection of the mystical tenor of the current philosophies and
- |2
                      religions of the late Em- pire. The medical theme
- |2
                      is absent in the Greek tradi- tion and this
- |2
                      seems to have been derived from Eastern sources. First found in Chinese
- |2
                      alchemical works em- phasizing the
- |2
                      lengthening of life and the search for immortality, medical alchemy was
- |2
                      integrated first into Islamic and then into Western alchemy and medicine.There is little doubt that alchemy, understood in its broadest sense as a
- |2
                      chemical key to nature, played a significant role in the development of the
- |2
                      Scientific Revolution. The claim that this mystical science should
- |2
                      replace the Aristotelianism and Galenism of the schools was looked on with
- |2
                      dismay by early seventeenth- century
- |2
                      mechanists who were forced to clarify their
- |2
                       own views in their attacks on authors such as Paracelsus and
- |2
                      Robert Fludd. At the same time, however, the chemical and alchemical call
- |2
                      for a new science based on new observations in nature was important in
- |2
                      a period that witnessed an ever-lessening adherence to scholastic
- |2
                      authority. Finally, the Paracelsian and iatro-
- |2
                          chemical adoption of the primary goal of the medical alchemy of
- |2
                      the Middle Ages resulted in the permanent acceptance of chemistry as a
- |2
                      legitimate tool of the physician and the pharmacist.The standard source for Greek alchemy is the Catalogue des manuscrits alchimiques Grecs edited by J.

  \               ALCHEMY\n                \n            \tThe alchemy of the sixteenth
  and the seventeenth\n                    centuries represents a fusion of many seemingly
  dis-\n                        parate themes derived from ancient and medieval Near
  and Far\n                    Eastern sources. A simple definition is difficult if
  not impossible. The\n                    alchemists always maintained\n                     a
  special interest in the changes of matter and surely most of\n                    them
  accepted the concept of transmutation, but there were other\n                    significant
  strains evident in al- chemical\n                    thought as well. Important
  among these was the early and persistent belief\n                    that the study
  of alchemy had a special role in medicine through the\n                    preparation
  of remedies and the search for the prolongation of life.\n                    In
  addition to this was the belief that alchemy was the fundamental science\n                    for
  the investigation of nature. And yet, if the alchemists spoke\n                    repeatedly
  of experi- ence and observation as\n                    the true keys to nature,
  they also maintained a fervent belief in a\n                    universe unified
  through the relationship of the macrocosm and the\n                    microcosm—a
  relationship that of necessity tied this science to\n                    astrology.
  The alchemists were convinced further that their search for the\n                    truths
  of nature might be conceived in terms of a religious quest which\n                    would
  result in a greater knowledge of the Creator. It is not\n                    surprising
  then to find a late sixteenth-century author defining medicine\n                    as
  “the searching out of the secretes of nature,” a\n                    goal that
  was to be accomplished by resort to “mathematicall and\n                    supernaturall
  precepts, the ex- ercise whereof\n                    is Mechanicall, and to be
  accomplished with labor.” Having thus\n                    defined medicine, he
  went on to state that the real name of this art was\n                    simply
  chemistry or alchemy (Bostocke, 1585).\n                In short, while few would
  deny that there were elements of modern science in\n                    alchemy,
  it is also true that this was a study permeated with a\n                    mysticism
  foreign to the post-Newtonian world.\n                \n                    \n                        ALCHEMY
  IN ANTIQUITY\n                    \n                The difficulty in dating alchemical
  texts has resulted in a long-standing\n                    controversy over its
  origins. Yet, if the priority of Near Eastern, Indian,\n                    and
  Chinese al- chemists remains in dispute,\n                    there is general agreement
  among scholars that the student in search of the\n                    roots of alchemy
  must be concerned not only with early concepts of\n                    nature, but
  also with the practical craft traditions of antiquity. The\n                    oldest
  surviving works of metal craftsmen combine an emphasis on the\n                    change
  in the appearance of metals with the acceptance of a vitalistic\n                    view
  of nature—a view that included the belief that metals live\n                    and
  grow within the earth in a fashion analogous to the growth of a human\n                    fetus.
  It was to become fundamental to alchemical thought that the\n                    operator
  might hasten the natural process of metallic growth in his\n                    laboratory
  and thus bring about perfection in a period of time far less\n                    than
  that required by nature.\n                Several texts point to the existence of
  a practical proto-alchemical\n                    literature in the ancient Near
  East. The recent study of two Babylonian\n                    tablets (Oppen- heim,
  1966) dating from the\n                    thirteenth century B.C.028\n                     but
  copied from still earlier originals describes the\n                    production
  of “silver” from a copper/bronze mixture.\n                    These early recipes
  already contain elements of ritual and the processes\n                    themselves
  call for secrecy. Both were to become common themes in later\n                    alchemical
  literature. The Leiden and Stockholm papyri (ca. third\n                    century
  A.D.) would appear to be part of the same practical tradition.\n                    Here,
  among some three hundred recipes, will be found directions for the\n                    imitation
  of the noble metals. A method for the doubling of asem (the gold-silver alloy, electrum)
  indicates the\n                    future direction of alchemical literature. The
  similarity be- tween the directions given in these papyri and\n                        passa-
  ges in the Physica et Mystica of Bolos Democritos of Mendes (perhaps as\n                    early
  as 200 B.C.) indicates that the latter work also profited from an\n                    acquaintance
  with the metal craft tradition. However, mystical\n                    passages
  in his work were to become the subject of exegesis for\n                    Hellenistic
  alchemists of late antiquity. The pseudo-Democritos was revered\n                    by
  them as a sage of great authority and his work thus forms a\n                    connecting
  link between the practical metal craft tradition and the\n                    true
  Alexandrian alchemy of late antiquity.\n                Alexandrian alchemy was
  based on Greek philosophy as well as on the\n                    practical tradition
  of the craftsmen. The early comparisons of man and\n                    nature found
  in the pre-Socratics and in Plato's Timaeus fostered an inter- est in the\n                    relationship
  of the macrocosm and the microcosm, a doctrine which played a\n                    major
  role in alchemical thought well into the seventeenth century.\n                    Systems
  of intermediary beings and the pneuma were\n                    employed by the
  Stoics, the Neo-Platonists, and other philosophical sects\n                    in
  antiquity to provide connecting links between the two worlds.\n                Also
  important for the development of alchemical thought was the long\n                    tradition
  of speculation on the Creation. The philosopher interested in\n                    both
  the Crea- tion and Nature was inevitably\n                    drawn to the question
  of the origin of the elements and the possibility of aprima materia. The views of
  the pre-Socratics on\n                    the prime matter formed a springboard
  from which later authors\n                    launched their own concepts. Thus
  Aristotle conveniently summarized the\n                    views of his predecessors
  prior to refuting them in his Metaphysics. However, the subject was one of no less
  importance\n                    to him than it had been to them. Aristotle accepted
  the four\n                    Empedoclean elements (earth, air, water, and fire)
  with their attendant\n                    qualities and he believed that they were
  mutually transmutable.\n                The genesis of the elements also forms an
  important section of Plato's Timaeus where the subject is devel- oped mathematically,
  but to alchemical authors of\n                    late antiquity who were influenced
  by Neo-Platonic, Gnos- tic, and Christian sources, the accounts found in Gene\n
  \                   sis and the Pymander attributed to Hermes\n                        Trisme-
  gistus were no less\n                    significant. Surely the alchemical literature
  was stamped with a\n                    Creation-element theme throughout its existence.
  In the sixteenth and\n                    the seventeenth centuries chemical authors
  still focused on the\n                    elements in their defense or attack of
  any given system. An important\n                    example may be found in Ger-
  hard Dorn's defense\n                    of the Paracelsians which he based on an
  analysis of the\n                    “Physics of Genesis” and the “Physics of\n
  \                   Hermes.” Similarly Robert Boyle placed special emphasis on the\n
  \                   problem of the elements in his criticism of the Aristotelians
  and the\n                    Paracelsian chemists in the Sceptical Chymist\n                    (1661).\n
  \               The earliest true alchemical texts in Greek date from the end of
  the third\n                    century A.D. These are clearly connected with the
  earlier practical\n                    tradition as well as with current philosophical
  and religious thought.\n                    Two of the more important authors are
  Zosimos, author of the encyclopedic\n                        Cheirokmeta, whose
  work links these alchemical\n                    texts with the book of Bolos Demo-
  critos,\n                    and Maria the Jewess, whose text is significant for
  its detailed\n                    description of the laboratory equipment of the
  Alexandrian alchemist. The\n                    latter work indicates that the emphasis
  on distillation and sublimation\n                        proc- esses—still so pronounced\n
  \                   in the Renaissance—was already characteristic of alchemical\n
  \                   recipes in late antiquity. These Alexandrian texts are openly
  con- cerned with transmutation. The processes\n                    given stress
  color change as a guide to progress—from black\n                    to white to
  yellow to violet. The sequence was clearly associated with\n                    the
  change from a chaotic and un- defined\n                    primal matter to metallic
  perfection. And al-\n                    though the final stage was eventually to
  be changed from violet to\n                    red, the emphasis on color was to
  remain a basic theme in descriptions of\n                    the Great Work.\n                Although
  practical recipes form part of these third-\n                        and fourth-century
  texts there is also present in them a\n                    pronounced interest in
  secrecy and mysticism. Alle-\n                        gorical dream sequences form
  part of this literature, and the\n                    role of spirits is considered
  important in the transformation of matter.\n                    And while one may
  extract some scientific information from the Greek\n                    alchemical
  codices, he will find it difficult to separate this\n                    material
  from the ever-present religious aura that pervades these\n                    works.
  An example may be seen in the analogous treat-\n                        ment of
  metals and mankind. Because of the truth of this it was\n                    felt
  that the operator might follow the death and resurrection theme as he\n                    pursued
  his work. It was this aspect of alchemical thought that dominates\n                    the
  later Greek texts. The work of Stephanos (ca. 610-41) is replete\n                    with
  prayers, invocations, and allegorical descriptions. There is little\n                    indication
  here that the alchemist still had close personal contact with\n                    the
  laboratory. The text of Stephanos was highly influential029\n                     and
  it was used by later alchemists both as a model and as a\n                    subject
  for commentaries. Alexandrian al- chemy\n                    did not continue much
  longer as a living tradi-\n                    tion. Before the tenth century the
  basic texts had been codified and\n                    few new texts were composed
  in Greek after that time.\n                Although Pliny and Dioscorides refer
  to mineral substances of medical value,\n                    Hellenistic alchemical
  texts do not indicate any real concern with pharma- ceutical chemistry. This is
  in\n                    marked contrast with the development of alchemy in China
  and India. As\n                    early as the eighth century B.C. there was a
  belief in physical\n                    immortality in China, and this was later
  to become closely associated with\n                    Taoist thought. A text from
  the second century B.C. refers to the\n                    transmutation of cinnabar
  to gold and within a few hundred years the\n                    concept of longevity
  was to be clearly connected with chemically prepared\n                    drugs
  and elixirs. This is evident in the Nei P'ien\n                    of Ko Hung (ca.
  A.D. 320) which was to become a standard Chinese text on\n                    this
  subject. In it will be found sections on the transmutation of\n                    metals
  and on elixirs of life—and all this mixed with rules\n                    for the
  attainment of long life and immortality. Chinese alchemy paralleled\n                    Alexandrian
  alchemy in its frequent reference to the macrocosm-microcosm\n                    analogy
  as well as in the development of both esoteric and exoteric\n                    approaches
  to this subject. Thus, while the Chinese alchemist sought a\n                    potable
  gold and various chemically prepared drugs in his quest for\n                    longevity
  and immor- tality, the texts also\n                    indicate a real interest
  in alchemy as the search for the inner perfection\n                    of the soul.\n
  \               From India the Sanskrit Atharva Veda (perhaps as\n                    early
  as the eighth century B.C.) refers to the use of gold as a means of\n                    preserving
  life, and there are other early texts relating gold to\n                    immortality.
  Buddhist texts of the second to the fifth centuries A.D.\n                    discuss
  the transmutation of base metals to gold by means of a juice\n                    concocted
  from vegetable and mineral sources. The still later tantric-Hatha\n                    yoga
  texts (post-eighth century) show the same trend toward increased mys- ticism already
  noted in the Greek and the\n                    Chinese sources. Here the operator
  undergoes the experience of an\n                    initiatory death and this is
  followed by a resur-\n                        rection. In metals the result may
  be seen in the perfec- tion of gold—in man, the\n                    alchemist induces
  in his own person a similar separation of spirit from\n                    gross
  matter. In this case the result is a perfected person with an\n                    infinitely
  prolonged youth.\n                \n                    \n                        ISLAMIC
  ALCHEMY\n                    \n                Similarities between Chinese and
  Indian alchemy have long led to\n                    speculations regarding the
  possible transmission of common concepts. To\n                    date, however,
  few facts have come to light to substantiate these\n                     speculations.
  The origins of Islamic alchemy are some- what easier to discern. Here there is\n
  \                   little question about the importance of Greek sources. Traditionally\n
  \                   Prince Khalid ibn Yazid (d. 704) was the first Muslim convert
  to alchemy\n                    and it is significant that his teacher was said
  to be one Morienos, a pupil\n                    of the legendary Stephanos of Alexandria.
  Although there is little likeli- hood of truth in this story, the strong\n                    Greek
  influence on Islamic alchemy may be further confirmed by fre- quent references to
  Alexandrian authors and\n                    the gen- eral use of Greek philosophical\n
  \                   concepts. Translations were made into Arabic at learned centers\n
  \                   throughout the Near East not only of the works of such major
  figures\n                    as Aristotle, Galen, and Ptolemy, but also of Zosimos,
  Bolos Democritos,\n                    and Stephanos. Among these centers the old
  Sassanian academy at Jundi- Shapur played a role. Similarly a\n                    group
  of Sabians at Harran were influential in transmitting Indian alchemi- cal and astrological
  thought into the\n                    Islamic tradition.\n                The ascription
  of alchemical works to earlier authors was as common to\n                    Islamic
  authors as it had been to their Greek predecessors. The short\n                    alchemical
  classic, the “Emerald Table,” was said to\n                    have been written
  by Hermes Trismegistus, but the earliest surviving\n                    version
  is in an early ninth-century Arabic text ascribed to the\n                    first-century
  (A.D.) magician, Apollonios of Tyana. A similar problem\n                    exists
  in regard to the Turba philosophorum.\n                    This exists only in Latin,
  but it has been shown by E. J. Holmyard and J.\n                    Ruska to have
  been composed originally in Arabic early in the tenth cen- tury. The dialogue form
  is used in the Turba and the speakers are supposedly the Greek\n                    philosophers
  of an- tiquity. Islamic alchemy\n                    did not confine itself to Greek
  sages and gods alone in this regard. The\n                    eighth-century scholar,
  Jabir-ibn-Hayyan, probably authored only a few\n                    works on alchemy.
  However, some two thousand titles are ascribed to him.\n                    The
  great bulk of these seem to derive from members of the Isma'ilya sect,\n                    the
  Brotherhood of Purity, and they date from the ninth and the tenth\n                    centuries.\n
  \               Islamic alchemy is characterized by both the practi-\n                        cal
  and the mystical elements seen in the earlier Greek texts.\n                    There
  are frequent warnings that the information being revealed is for the\n                    initiated
  alone and there is a continued use of the allegorical approach\n                    which
  had become common in late Greek works. The religious nature of\n                    the
  art is emphasized and the predominant vitalism favored by alchemical\n                    authors
  may be seen in discussions of the generation of metals, and in\n                    the
  sexual interpretation of fundamental stages of the great work. As\n                    in
  the Alexandrian texts the progress of the operator may be followed\n                    through
  the now standard sequence of color changes. The concept of the\n                        philoso-
  pher's stone is also well\n                    developed in the Arabic litera-030\n
  \                   \n                    ture. This stone allegedly provided a
  substance which brought\n                    about the rapid transmutation of base
  metals to gold. It derived from the\n                    earlier concept of special
  elixirs which might cure illnesses in man and\n                    which in an analogous
  fashion might perfect—or\n                    cure— imperfect metals in inanimate
  nature.\n                Aristotelian element theory is commonly employed in the
  Arabic texts, but in\n                    addition the Jabirian works employed the
  Sulphur-Mercury theory of the\n                    metals. This concept suggests
  that all metals are composed of\n                    different proportions of a
  sophic sulphur and a sophic mercury. While there\n                    was general
  agreement that these two substances have a resemblance to\n                    common
  sulphur and mercury, it was asserted that they were much purer\n                    than
  anything that could be produced in the laboratory. A quantitative\n                    relationship
  between the two was implied, but the mathematical\n                    relationship
  expressed in these texts may be most easily related to\n                    the
  number mysticism favored by the Neo-Pythago- reans and Eastern mystics. Although
  the Sulphur- Mercury theory appears first in\n                    this literature,
  it seems to be a modification of the concept of the two\n                        exhala-
  tions within the earth that lead\n                    to the formation of minerals
  and metals. This concept is discussed in\n                    the fourth book of
  Aristotle's Meteorologica.\n                In the Arabic literature the reader
  finds an emphasis on medical chemistry\n                    for the first time outside
  of the Far East and India. The work of the\n                    physician al-Razi
  (Rhazes, 860-925) is decidedly practical in nature.\n                    Although
  he accepted the truth of transmutation and discussed elixirs of\n                    varying
  powers, in the Book of the Secret of Secrets\n                    Razi spoke at
  length of chemical equipment and he described in detail the\n                    laboratory
  operations requisite for the chemist. In addition he\n                    described
  a large number of laboratory reagents and classified them into\n                    the
  categories of “animal,” “min- eral,”\n                    “vegetable,” and “derivative.”\n
  \                   Chemical texts continued to employ the first three of these
  as a basic\n                    scheme for arrangement until well into the eighteenth
  century. Razi's\n                    interest in medicine and practical chemistry
  influenced later Islamic work\n                    in medical chemistry. The work

  tenth century) indi-\n                    cates a special interest in chemically

  \                       THE EARLY LATIN ALCHEMY OF THE WEST\n                    \n
  \               \n                Western alchemy developed from Arabic sources.
  As Islamic scholars had\n                    sought alchemical texts in the eighth
  century, so their Latin counterparts\n                    sought sim- ilar works
  four centuries later. The\n                    earliest dated Latin translation
  of this genre is the story of Prince\n                    Khalid and Morienos. This
  was completed by Robert of Chester on the\n                    eleventh of February,
  1144, a year after he had translated the Koran and a\n                    year prior
  to the\n                     completion of his translation of the Algebra\n                    of
  al- Khwarizmi. The De\n                        compositione alchemiae of Morienos
  proved to be only the\n                    first of many such translations made
  during the following century.\n                There are frequent references to
  alchemy in the work of Thomas Aquinas and\n                    from the commentaries
  on Aristotle written by Albertus Magnus it is clear\n                    that the
  subject was of great interest to thirteenth-century scholars.\n                    Albertus
  knew the work of Avicenna and he commented on the fact that this\n                    Islamic
  scholar had both accepted and denied the possibility of transmuta- tion in different
  works ascribed\n                    to him. Although Albertus believed in the truth
  of transmutation\n                    himself, he remained skeptical of the “transmuted”\n
  \                   metals he had seen, since the artificial product had not been
  able to\n                    withstand the heat of the fire. With Albertus we also
  have early evidence\n                    of the application of the sulphur-mercury
  theory in the West. In his\n                        De miner-\n                    alibus
  he referred to the ancient concept of the ex- halations, but he went on to discuss
  a new\n                    theory that attributed the origin of metals to sulphur
  and mercury.\n                Some of the most interesting medieval alchemical treatises
  date from the\n                    late thirteenth and the early fourteenth centuries.
  The Pretiosa Margarita Novella of Petrus Bonus of Ferrara (ca.\n                    1330)
  reflects the influ- ence of\n                    scholasticism in its tripartite
  structure. Argu-\n                        ments in favor of transmutation follow
  the initial refutations,\n                    and these in turn are followed by
  positive answers to the objections. Peter\n                    accepted transmuta-
  tion himself, and he\n                    further stated that the true process might
  easily be learned in an hour. At\n                    the same time he was honest
  enough to admit that he did not know how\n                    to produce gold himself.
  No less influential was the Summa perfectionis which was ascribed to Jabir (Latinized
  as\n                    Geber, late thirteenth century). As in thePrecious Pearl\n
  \                    the sulphur-mercury theory forms the theoretical basis for
  an\n                    understanding of the metals, and the alchemist is informed
  that he must\n                    arrange these substances (understood as ideal
  substances resem- bling most in nature common sulphur and\n                    mercury)
  in perfect proportions for the consummation of the Great\n                    Work.
  Geber described in considerable detail the laboratory processes and\n                    equipment
  of the alchemist. This text reflects an important change in\n                    distillation
  techniques that seems to have originated among twelfth-\n                    and
  thirteenth-century chemists. The intro-\n                        duction of condensation
  at this time made possible the\n                    collection of low boiling fractions
  for the first time. As a result we find\n                    in the literature of
  the mid-twelfth century the first reference to\n                    alcohol. Geber
  confirms this change in equipment and procedure. He\n                    described
  condensation apparatus in detail, and in addition he was the\n                    first
  to give a method for the preparation of a mineral acid—our\n                    nitric
  acid. These substances plus the mixtures of other mineral acids\n                    placed
  powerful031\n                     new reagents in the hands of alchemists who were
  to use them\n                    regularly after this period.\n                The
  alchemy of the late fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries indicates an\n                    increasing
  interest in allegorical and mystical themes. Thomas Norton's\n                        Ordinall
  of Alchimy (1477) is little\n                    concerned with clear-cut de- scriptions
  of\n                    chemical processes or laboratory equip- ment.\n                    Rather,
  we meet here with a lengthy poetical account of the difficult\n                    nature
  of the work, the need of virtue for its successful conclusion, and\n                    veiled
  de- scriptions of the true process.\n                    These and similar texts
  were accompanied by a widespread reaction\n                    against alchemy.
  The unsavory characterization of the alche- mist in medieval literature knows no
  better example\n                    than Chaucer's “Canon's Yeoman's Tale” (ca.
  1390)\n                    while on an official level there were the decrees and
  statutes of Pope John\n                    XXII (1317) and Henry IV of England (1404)
  directed against those who\n                    attempted to multiply gold.\n                Closely
  connected with the widespread medieval interest in transmutation was\n                    a
  parallel trend toward medical chemistry. By the fourteenth century distilla- tion
  and other chemical processes\n                    were in use among Italian physicians
  as a means of identifying the dis- solved substances in the much frequented\n                    mineral
  water spas. A century later Michael Savonarola ordered these\n                    tests
  into a procedural form that became the basis of the later methods of\n                    aqueous
  analyses composed by Gabriel Fallopius and Robert Boyle in the\n                    sixteenth
  and seventeenth centuries.\n                No less important was the medieval physicians'
  de-\n                        pendence on alchemy as a source for new medicines.
  The Eastern\n                    interest in the prolongation of life is evident
  here. This may be seen as\n                    early as the mid- thirteenth century
  in\n                    the work of Roger Bacon. Bacon fully accepted the truth
  of metallic\n                    transmutation and he suggested that this might
  be utilized to\n                    alleviate the poverty of mankind. For Bacon
  alchemy was a major field\n                    of experimental science and he explicitly
  stated that one of its goals was\n                    the search for a length- ened
  life span. In\n                    the Opus tertium (1267) he com- mented that although
  many physicians used chemical\n                    processes to prepare their medicines,
  very few of them knew how to make\n                    metals and fewer still knew
  how to perform those works which led to the\n                    prolongation of
  life.\n                The same theme occurs in the work of Bacon's younger contemporary,
  Arnold of\n                    Villanova, who argued that alchemy must play an important
  role in the\n                    much needed reform of medicine. In this way new
  remedies and the elixir of\n                    life might be found. The alchemist
  John of Rupescissa (mid-fourteenth\n                    century) insisted that the
  only real purpose of alchemy was to benefit\n                    mankind. His works
  abound with medicinal preparations derived from metals\n                    and
  minerals and he\n                     emphasized distillation processes which seemingly
  separated\n                    pure quintessences from the gross matter of the natural
  substances. It was\n                    this medieval tradition of medical chemistry
  that bore fruit in the\n                    Renaissance “distillation books” of
  Hieronymus\n                    Brunschwig, Con- rad Gesner, and others who\n                    looked
  on alchemy and chemical operations as a basic tool for the\n                    preparation
  of medicines rather than the search for gold.\n                \n                    \n
  \                       RENAISSANCE ALCHEMY AND THE “NEW\n                            SCIENCE”\n
  \                   \n                The work of Marsilio Ficino and his followers
  asso-\n                        ciated with the Platonic Academy in Florence resulted
  in a\n                    heightened interest in the mystical texts of late antiquity.
  Ficino himself\n                    translated the Hermetic corpus (1463) and this
  text was of great influence\n                    in the revival of Natural Magic,
  Astrology, and Alchemy. Interest in\n                    these subjects is closely
  intertwined with the course of the Scientific\n                    Revolution. Indeed,
  the sixteenth and the early seventeenth centuries\n                    witnessed
  an ever-quickening concern with alchemy. This new interest\n                    reached
  a peak in the middle years of the latter century before declining.\n                    It
  was just at this time that the major collected editions of alchemical\n                    classics
  were being prepared by Zetzner (1602, 1622, 1659-61), Ashmole\n                    (1652),
  and Manget (1702).\n                The fresh flavor of Renaissance alchemy is perhaps
  best seen in the work of\n                    Paracelsus (1493-1541) and his followers.
  The iatrochemists of the\n                    sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries
  follow directly in the steps\n                    of their medieval predecessors.
  Like them, they ex-\n                        pressed an interest in transmutation,
  but they were primarily\n                    concerned with the medical applications
  of alchemy. For some this meant the\n                    preparation of chemical
  drugs, but for others it meant a mystical\n                    alchemical approach
  to medicine that might apply to macrocosmic as well as\n                    to microcosmic
  phenomena.\n                Paracelsus may be characterized as one of the many nature
  philosophers of\n                    his time, but he differs from others in his
  emphasis on the importance of\n                    medicine and alchemy as bases
  for a new understanding of the universe.\n                    Characteristic of
  the Paracelsians was their firm opposition to the\n                    dominant
  Aristotelian-Galenic tradition of the universities. They were\n                    unyielding
  in their opposition to Scholasticism which they sought to\n                    replace
  with a philosophy influenced by the recently translated\n                    Neo-Platonic
  and Hermetic texts. The reli-\n                    gious nature of their quest is
  ever present. Man was to seek an\n                    understanding of his Creator
  through the two books of divine revelation;\n                    the Holy Scriptures
  and the Book of Creation—Nature. The\n                    Paracelsians constantly
  called for a new observational approach to\n                    nature, and for
  them chemistry or alchemy seemed to be the best example of\n                    what
  this new science should be. The Paracelsians were quick to offer an alchemical032\n
  \                    interpretation of Genesis. Here they pictured the Cre- ation
  as the work of a divine alchemist\n                    separating the beings and
  objects of the earth and the heavens from\n                    the unformed prima
  materia much as the alchemist\n                    may distill pure quintessence
  from a grosser form of matter.\n                The search for physical truth in
  the biblical account of the Creation\n                    focused special attention
  on the forma- tion\n                    of the elements. Paracelsus regularly used
  the Aristotelian elements, but\n                    he also introduced the tria\n
  \                   prima—the principles of Salt. Sulphur, and Mercury.\n                    The
  latter were a modification of the old sulphur- mercury theory of the metals, but
  they differed\n                    from the older concept in that they were to apply
  to all things rather\n                    than being limited to the metals alone.
  The introduction of these\n                    principles had the effect of calling
  into question the whole framework of\n                    ancient medicine and natural
  philosophy since these had been grounded\n                    upon the Aristotelian
  elements. Furthermore, the fact that Paracelsus had\n                    not clearly
  defined his principles tended to make the whole question of\n                        ele-
  mentary substances an ill-defined\n                    one.\n                The
  Paracelsians sought to interpret their world in terms of alchemy or\n                    chemistry.
  On the macrocosmic level they spoke of meteorological events in\n                    terms
  of chemical analogies. On the geocosmic level they argued over\n                    differing
  chemical interpretations of the growth of minerals and the origin\n                    of
  mountain springs. And in their search for agricultural improvements\n                    they
  postulated the importance of dissolved salts as the reason for\n                    the
  beneficial result of fertilizing with manure. For them this was the\n                    familiar
  universal salt of the alchemists.\n                The Paracelsians approached medicine
  in a similar fashion. They felt assured\n                    that their knowledge
  of the macrocosm might be properly applied to the\n                        micro-
  cosm. Thus, if an aerial sulphur\n                    and niter were the cause of
  thunder and lightning in the heavens, the\n                    same aerial effluvia
  might be inhaled and generate burning diseases in\n                    the body.
  Similarly, chemical deposits were formed when the internal archei\n                    governing
  the various organs failed to properly eliminate impurities from\n                    the
  system.\n                The Renaissance was a period of new and violent diseases
  and the chemical\n                    physicians stated that their new stronger
  remedies were essential for the\n                    proper cures. The work of Paracelsus
  is reminiscent of medie- val distillation chemistry, but by the end of the\n                    century
  iatrochemists were turning less to distilled quintes- sences and more to precipitates
  and\n                    residues in their search for new remedies. In all cases
  it was argued\n                    that alchemical procedures resulted in the separation
  of pure substances\n                    from inactive impurities.\n                In
  the century between 1550 and 1650 conflicts between Paracelsian\n                    iatrochemists
  and more traditional\n                     Galenists were common. The detailed critique
  of the Paracelsian\n                    position by Thomas Erastus became a fun-\n
  \                   damental text for those who opposed the chemical medicine, and
  a\n                    sharp confrontation between chemists and Galenists followed
  in Paris in the\n                    first decade of the seventeenth century. Here
  the debate centered\n                    largely around the possible dangers of
  the new med-\n                        icines. Both Andreas Libavius and Daniel Sennert
  re- viewed this controversy and concluded that the best\n                    course
  for physicians would be to accept the useful remedies of both the\n                    old
  and the new systems. This was the compromise position taken by the\n                    compilers
  of the Pharmacopoeia of the Royal College\n                    of Physi- cians of
  London (1618) and after\n                    this time there were few who denied
  the value of chemistry for medicine.\n                Yet, if the chemists debated
  with more traditional philosophers and\n                    physicians, they disagreed
  no less among themselves. At the opening of the\n                    seventeenth
  century Robert Fludd defended the chemically oriented\n                    views
  of the Rosicrucians and he described his mystical alchemical\n                    interpretation
  of nature and supernature in a series of folio volumes on\n                    the
  macro- cosm and the microcosm. Here he\n                    placed considerable
  emphasis on an alchemical interpretation of the Crea- tion and he utilized mechanical
  examples to\n                    support his views. His work gave support to the
  alchemical plea for a\n                    new science and it was viewed with alarm
  by Johannes Kepler, Marin\n                    Mersenne, and Pierre Gassendi.\n
  \               Jean Baptiste van Helmont was no less a chemical philosopher than
  Fludd, and\n                    he described in detail his transmutation of mercury
  to gold by means of a\n                    small sample of the philosopher's stone.
  Van Helmont sought a chemical\n                    understanding of man through
  medicine, but, in contrast to Fludd and most\n                    Paracelsians,
  he rejected the macrocosm-microcosm analogy. Van Helmont\n                    thus
  was less interested in macrocosmic and geocosmic phenomena than Fludd\n                    and
  he concentrated more on practical and theoretical medical\n                    questions.
  The influence of both authors was considerable in an age\n                    when
  great uncertainty existed about the future course of the new science.\n                    As
  late as 1650 John French could still suggest that only chemistry should\n                    properly
  be considered the basis for a reform of the universities.\n                    Similarly
  John Webster (1654) stated that the new learning must be grounded\n                    principally
  upon the works of Francis Bacon and Robert Fludd.\n                \n                    \n
  \                       EPILOGUE\n                    \n                If the chemical
  philosophy seemed a plausible alter-\n                        native to the work
  of the mechanical philosophers in the middle\n                    decades of the
  seventeenth century, this alternative did not remain a\n                    viable
  one for long. The impressive results of the\n                    mechanists—culminating
  in033\n                     the Principia mathematica of Isaac\n                    Newton
  (1687)—stamped on “respectable”\n                    natural philosophy the mathematical
  abstraction of the new physics.\n                    And yet, this is not to say
  that alchemical thought died after a final\n                    flowering in the
  sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries. The collection of\n                    manuscripts
  at King's Col- lege, Cambridge\n                    leaves little doubt that Isaac
  Newton was passionately concerned with the\n                    traditional prob-
  lems of transmutation.\n                    Furthermore, recent research indicates
  that Newton's alchemical\n                    speculations may have been instrumental
  in the crystallization of some\n                    of his more acceptable concepts
  of physics. Similarly, Robert Boyle was\n                    influenced by alchemical
  thought. He published on the degradation of silver\n                    and his
  theoretical views were strongly influenced by his early\n                    reading
  of van Helmont. However, it is possible to go beyond these\n                    examples.
  Alchemical works were written by the important practical chemist,\n                    Johann
  Rudolf Glauber and the medical chemistry of the Renaissance\n                    alchemists
  found a new proponent in the revision of Franciscus Sylvius de\n                    la
  Böe whose work went through numerous seventeenth- and\n                    eighteenth-century
  edi- tions. In like manner\n                    many elements of Paracelsian chemistry
  were retained in somewhat altered\n                    form in the texts of the
  eighteenth-century phlogiston chemists. At\n                    the same time the
  German revival of alchemy and Rosicrucianism stimulated a\n                    new
  interest in earlier interpretations of a vitalistic and mystically\n                    oriented
  universe. The impact of this on the growth of the\n                    nineteenth-century
  Naturphilosophie has yet to be as- sessed.\n                Many characteristic
  themes of alchemical thought and style are present in\n                    the earliest
  texts that have survived. Both the secrecy and the practical\n                    recipes
  of the metallic craft tradition are evident in the works of\n                    the
  late Hellenistic authors dating from the late third and the fourth\n                    centuries
  A.D. The allegorical and sym-\n                    bolical style of later alchemical
  works is also present here, and\n                    this is a reflection of the
  mystical tenor of the current philosophies and\n                    religions of
  the late Em- pire. The medical theme\n                    is absent in the Greek
  tradi- tion and this\n                    seems to have been derived from Eastern
  sources. First found in Chinese\n                    alchemical works em- phasizing
  the\n                    lengthening of life and the search for immortality, medical
  alchemy was\n                    integrated first into Islamic and then into Western
  alchemy and medicine.\n                There is little doubt that alchemy, understood
  in its broadest sense as a\n                    chemical key to nature, played a
  significant role in the development of the\n                    Scientific Revolution.
  The claim that this mystical science should\n                    replace the Aristotelianism
  and Galenism of the schools was looked on with\n                    dismay by early
  seventeenth- century\n                    mechanists who were forced to clarify
  their\n                     own views in their attacks on authors such as Paracelsus
  and\n                    Robert Fludd. At the same time, however, the chemical and
  alchemical call\n                    for a new science based on new observations
  in nature was important in\n                    a period that witnessed an ever-lessening
  adherence to scholastic\n                    authority. Finally, the Paracelsian
  and iatro-\n                        chemical adoption of the primary goal of the
  medical alchemy of\n                    the Middle Ages resulted in the permanent
  acceptance of chemistry as a\n                    legitimate tool of the physician
  and the pharmacist.\n                \n                    \n                        BIBLIOGRAPHY\n

  represents a fusion of many seemingly dis-\n                        parate themes
  derived from ancient and medieval Near and Far\n                    Eastern sources.
  A simple definition is difficult if not impossible. The\n                    alchemists
  always maintained\n                     a special interest in the changes of matter
  and surely most of\n                    them accepted the concept of transmutation,
  but there were other\n                    significant strains evident in al- chemical\n
  \                   thought as well. Important among these was the early and persistent
  belief\n                    that the study of alchemy had a special role in medicine
  through the\n                    preparation of remedies and the search for the
  prolongation of life.\n                    In addition to this was the belief that
  alchemy was the fundamental science\n                    for the investigation of
  nature. And yet, if the alchemists spoke\n                    repeatedly of experi-
  ence and observation as\n                    the true keys to nature, they also
  maintained a fervent belief in a\n                    universe unified through the
  relationship of the macrocosm and the\n                    microcosm—a relationship
  that of necessity tied this science to\n                    astrology. The alchemists
  were convinced further that their search for the\n                    truths of
  nature might be conceived in terms of a religious quest which\n                    would
  result in a greater knowledge of the Creator. It is not\n                    surprising
  then to find a late sixteenth-century author defining medicine\n                    as
  “the searching out of the secretes of nature,” a\n                    goal that
  was to be accomplished by resort to “mathematicall and\n                    supernaturall
  precepts, the ex- ercise whereof\n                    is Mechanicall, and to be
  accomplished with labor.” Having thus\n                    defined medicine, he
  went on to state that the real name of this art was\n                    simply
  chemistry or alchemy (Bostocke, 1585).In short, while few would deny that there
  were elements of modern science in\n                    alchemy, it is also true
  that this was a study permeated with a\n                    mysticism foreign to
  the post-Newtonian world.The difficulty in dating alchemical texts has resulted
  in a long-standing\n                    controversy over its origins. Yet, if the
  priority of Near Eastern, Indian,\n                    and Chinese al- chemists
  remains in dispute,\n                    there is general agreement among scholars
  that the student in search of the\n                    roots of alchemy must be
  concerned not only with early concepts of\n                    nature, but also
  with the practical craft traditions of antiquity. The\n                    oldest
  surviving works of metal craftsmen combine an emphasis on the\n                    change
  in the appearance of metals with the acceptance of a vitalistic\n                    view
  of nature—a view that included the belief that metals live\n                    and
  grow within the earth in a fashion analogous to the growth of a human\n                    fetus.
  It was to become fundamental to alchemical thought that the\n                    operator
  might hasten the natural process of metallic growth in his\n                    laboratory
  and thus bring about perfection in a period of time far less\n                    than
  that required by nature.Several texts point to the existence of a practical proto-alchemical\n
  \                   literature in the ancient Near East. The recent study of two
  Babylonian\n                    tablets (Oppen- heim, 1966) dating from the\n                    thirteenth
  century B.C.Alexandrian alchemy was based on Greek philosophy as well as on the\n
  \                   practical tradition of the craftsmen. The early comparisons
  of man and\n                    nature found in the pre-Socratics and in Plato's
  Timaeus fostered an inter- est in the\n                    relationship of the macrocosm
  and the microcosm, a doctrine which played a\n                    major role in
  alchemical thought well into the seventeenth century.\n                    Systems
  of intermediary beings and the pneuma were\n                    employed by the
  Stoics, the Neo-Platonists, and other philosophical sects\n                    in
  antiquity to provide connecting links between the two worlds.Also important for
  the development of alchemical thought was the long\n                    tradition
  of speculation on the Creation. The philosopher interested in\n                    both
  the Crea- tion and Nature was inevitably\n                    drawn to the question
  of the origin of the elements and the possibility of aprima materia. The views of
  the pre-Socratics on\n                    the prime matter formed a springboard
  from which later authors\n                    launched their own concepts. Thus
  Aristotle conveniently summarized the\n                    views of his predecessors
  prior to refuting them in his Metaphysics. However, the subject was one of no less
  importance\n                    to him than it had been to them. Aristotle accepted
  the four\n                    Empedoclean elements (earth, air, water, and fire)
  with their attendant\n                    qualities and he believed that they were
  mutually transmutable.The genesis of the elements also forms an important section
  of Plato's Timaeus where the subject is devel- oped mathematically, but to alchemical
  authors of\n                    late antiquity who were influenced by Neo-Platonic,
  Gnos- tic, and Christian sources, the accounts found in Gene\n                    sis
  and the Pymander attributed to Hermes\n                        Trisme- gistus were
  no less\n                    significant. Surely the alchemical literature was stamped
  with a\n                    Creation-element theme throughout its existence. In
  the sixteenth and\n                    the seventeenth centuries chemical authors
  still focused on the\n                    elements in their defense or attack of
  any given system. An important\n                    example may be found in Ger-
  hard Dorn's defense\n                    of the Paracelsians which he based on an
  analysis of the\n                    “Physics of Genesis” and the “Physics of\n
  \                   Hermes.” Similarly Robert Boyle placed special emphasis on the\n
  \                   problem of the elements in his criticism of the Aristotelians
  and the\n                    Paracelsian chemists in the Sceptical Chymist\n                    (1661).The
  earliest true alchemical texts in Greek date from the end of the third\n                    century
  A.D. These are clearly connected with the earlier practical\n                    tradition
  as well as with current philosophical and religious thought.\n                    Two
  of the more important authors are Zosimos, author of the encyclopedic\n                        Cheirokmeta,
  whose work links these alchemical\n                    texts with the book of Bolos
  Demo- critos,\n                    and Maria the Jewess, whose text is significant
  for its detailed\n                    description of the laboratory equipment of
  the Alexandrian alchemist. The\n                    latter work indicates that the
  emphasis on distillation and sublimation\n                        proc- esses—still
  so pronounced\n                    in the Renaissance—was already characteristic
  of alchemical\n                    recipes in late antiquity. These Alexandrian
  texts are openly con- cerned with transmutation. The processes\n                    given
  stress color change as a guide to progress—from black\n                    to white
  to yellow to violet. The sequence was clearly associated with\n                    the
  change from a chaotic and un- defined\n                    primal matter to metallic
  perfection. And al-\n                    though the final stage was eventually to
  be changed from violet to\n                    red, the emphasis on color was to
  remain a basic theme in descriptions of\n                    the Great Work.Although
  practical recipes form part of these third-\n                        and fourth-century
  texts there is also present in them a\n                    pronounced interest in
  secrecy and mysticism. Alle-\n                        gorical dream sequences form
  part of this literature, and the\n                    role of spirits is considered
  important in the transformation of matter.\n                    And while one may
  extract some scientific information from the Greek\n                    alchemical
  codices, he will find it difficult to separate this\n                    material
  from the ever-present religious aura that pervades these\n                    works.
  An example may be seen in the analogous treat-\n                        ment of
  metals and mankind. Because of the truth of this it was\n                    felt
  that the operator might follow the death and resurrection theme as he\n                    pursued
  his work. It was this aspect of alchemical thought that dominates\n                    the
  later Greek texts. The work of Stephanos (ca. 610-41) is replete\n                    with
  prayers, invocations, and allegorical descriptions. There is little\n                    indication
  here that the alchemist still had close personal contact with\n                    the
  laboratory. The text of Stephanos was highly influentialAlthough Pliny and Dioscorides
  refer to mineral substances of medical value,\n                    Hellenistic alchemical
  texts do not indicate any real concern with pharma- ceutical chemistry. This is
  in\n                    marked contrast with the development of alchemy in China
  and India. As\n                    early as the eighth century B.C. there was a
  belief in physical\n                    immortality in China, and this was later
  to become closely associated with\n                    Taoist thought. A text from
  the second century B.C. refers to the\n                    transmutation of cinnabar
  to gold and within a few hundred years the\n                    concept of longevity
  was to be clearly connected with chemically prepared\n                    drugs
  and elixirs. This is evident in the Nei P'ien\n                    of Ko Hung (ca.
  A.D. 320) which was to become a standard Chinese text on\n                    this
  subject. In it will be found sections on the transmutation of\n                    metals
  and on elixirs of life—and all this mixed with rules\n                    for the
  attainment of long life and immortality. Chinese alchemy paralleled\n                    Alexandrian
  alchemy in its frequent reference to the macrocosm-microcosm\n                    analogy
  as well as in the development of both esoteric and exoteric\n                    approaches
  to this subject. Thus, while the Chinese alchemist sought a\n                    potable
  gold and various chemically prepared drugs in his quest for\n                    longevity
  and immor- tality, the texts also\n                    indicate a real interest
  in alchemy as the search for the inner perfection\n                    of the soul.From
  India the Sanskrit Atharva Veda (perhaps as\n                    early as the eighth
  century B.C.) refers to the use of gold as a means of\n                    preserving
  life, and there are other early texts relating gold to\n                    immortality.
  Buddhist texts of the second to the fifth centuries A.D.\n                    discuss
  the transmutation of base metals to gold by means of a juice\n                    concocted
  from vegetable and mineral sources. The still later tantric-Hatha\n                    yoga
  texts (post-eighth century) show the same trend toward increased mys- ticism already
  noted in the Greek and the\n                    Chinese sources. Here the operator
  undergoes the experience of an\n                    initiatory death and this is
  followed by a resur-\n                        rection. In metals the result may
  be seen in the perfec- tion of gold—in man, the\n                    alchemist induces
  in his own person a similar separation of spirit from\n                    gross
  matter. In this case the result is a perfected person with an\n                    infinitely
  prolonged youth.Similarities between Chinese and Indian alchemy have long led to\n
  \                   speculations regarding the possible transmission of common concepts.
  To\n                    date, however, few facts have come to light to substantiate
  these\n                     speculations. The origins of Islamic alchemy are some-
  what easier to discern. Here there is\n                    little question about
  the importance of Greek sources. Traditionally\n                    Prince Khalid
  ibn Yazid (d. 704) was the first Muslim convert to alchemy\n                    and
  it is significant that his teacher was said to be one Morienos, a pupil\n                    of
  the legendary Stephanos of Alexandria. Although there is little likeli- hood of
  truth in this story, the strong\n                    Greek influence on Islamic
  alchemy may be further confirmed by fre- quent references to Alexandrian authors
  and\n                    the gen- eral use of Greek philosophical\n                    concepts.
  Translations were made into Arabic at learned centers\n                    throughout
  the Near East not only of the works of such major figures\n                    as
  Aristotle, Galen, and Ptolemy, but also of Zosimos, Bolos Democritos,\n                    and
  Stephanos. Among these centers the old Sassanian academy at Jundi- Shapur played
  a role. Similarly a\n                    group of Sabians at Harran were influential
  in transmitting Indian alchemi- cal and astrological thought into the\n                    Islamic
  tradition.The ascription of alchemical works to earlier authors was as common to\n
  \                   Islamic authors as it had been to their Greek predecessors.
  The short\n                    alchemical classic, the “Emerald Table,” was said
  to\n                    have been written by Hermes Trismegistus, but the earliest
  surviving\n                    version is in an early ninth-century Arabic text
  ascribed to the\n                    first-century (A.D.) magician, Apollonios of
  Tyana. A similar problem\n                    exists in regard to the Turba philosophorum.\n
  \                   This exists only in Latin, but it has been shown by E. J. Holmyard
  and J.\n                    Ruska to have been composed originally in Arabic early
  in the tenth cen- tury. The dialogue form is used in the Turba and the speakers
  are supposedly the Greek\n                    philosophers of an- tiquity. Islamic
  alchemy\n                    did not confine itself to Greek sages and gods alone
  in this regard. The\n                    eighth-century scholar, Jabir-ibn-Hayyan,
  probably authored only a few\n                    works on alchemy. However, some
  two thousand titles are ascribed to him.\n                    The great bulk of
  these seem to derive from members of the Isma'ilya sect,\n                    the
  Brotherhood of Purity, and they date from the ninth and the tenth\n                    centuries.Islamic
  alchemy is characterized by both the practi-\n                        cal and the
  mystical elements seen in the earlier Greek texts.\n                    There are
  frequent warnings that the information being revealed is for the\n                    initiated
  alone and there is a continued use of the allegorical approach\n                    which
  had become common in late Greek works. The religious nature of\n                    the
  art is emphasized and the predominant vitalism favored by alchemical\n                    authors
  may be seen in discussions of the generation of metals, and in\n                    the
  sexual interpretation of fundamental stages of the great work. As\n                    in
  the Alexandrian texts the progress of the operator may be followed\n                    through
  the now standard sequence of color changes. The concept of the\n                        philoso-
  pher's stone is also well\n                    developed in the Arabic litera-Aristotelian
  element theory is commonly employed in the Arabic texts, but in\n                    addition
  the Jabirian works employed the Sulphur-Mercury theory of the\n                    metals.
  This concept suggests that all metals are composed of\n                    different
  proportions of a sophic sulphur and a sophic mercury. While there\n                    was
  general agreement that these two substances have a resemblance to\n                    common
  sulphur and mercury, it was asserted that they were much purer\n                    than
  anything that could be produced in the laboratory. A quantitative\n                    relationship
  between the two was implied, but the mathematical\n                    relationship
  expressed in these texts may be most easily related to\n                    the
  number mysticism favored by the Neo-Pythago- reans and Eastern mystics. Although
  the Sulphur- Mercury theory appears first in\n                    this literature,
  it seems to be a modification of the concept of the two\n                        exhala-
  tions within the earth that lead\n                    to the formation of minerals
  and metals. This concept is discussed in\n                    the fourth book of
  Aristotle's Meteorologica.In the Arabic literature the reader finds an emphasis
  on medical chemistry\n                    for the first time outside of the Far
  East and India. The work of the\n                    physician al-Razi (Rhazes,
  860-925) is decidedly practical in nature.\n                    Although he accepted
  the truth of transmutation and discussed elixirs of\n                    varying
  powers, in the Book of the Secret of Secrets\n                    Razi spoke at
  length of chemical equipment and he described in detail the\n                    laboratory
  operations requisite for the chemist. In addition he\n                    described
  a large number of laboratory reagents and classified them into\n                    the
  categories of “animal,” “min- eral,”\n                    “vegetable,” and “derivative.”\n
  \                   Chemical texts continued to employ the first three of these
  as a basic\n                    scheme for arrangement until well into the eighteenth
  century. Razi's\n                    interest in medicine and practical chemistry
  influenced later Islamic work\n                    in medical chemistry. The work
  of ibn-Sina (Avicenna, 980-1037) and\n                    Abu Mansur Muwaffak (late
  tenth century) indi-\n                    cates a special interest in chemically
  prepared sub- stances of pharmaceutical value.Western alchemy developed from Arabic
  sources. As Islamic scholars had\n                    sought alchemical texts in
  the eighth century, so their Latin counterparts\n                    sought sim-
  ilar works four centuries later. The\n                    earliest dated Latin translation
  of this genre is the story of Prince\n                    Khalid and Morienos. This
  was completed by Robert of Chester on the\n                    eleventh of February,
  1144, a year after he had translated the Koran and a\n                    year prior
  to the\n                     completion of his translation of the Algebra\n                    of
  al- Khwarizmi. The De\n                        compositione alchemiae of Morienos
  proved to be only the\n                    first of many such translations made
  during the following century.There are frequent references to alchemy in the work
  of Thomas Aquinas and\n                    from the commentaries on Aristotle written
  by Albertus Magnus it is clear\n                    that the subject was of great
  interest to thirteenth-century scholars.\n                    Albertus knew the
  work of Avicenna and he commented on the fact that this\n                    Islamic
  scholar had both accepted and denied the possibility of transmuta- tion in different
  works ascribed\n                    to him. Although Albertus believed in the truth
  of transmutation\n                    himself, he remained skeptical of the “transmuted”\n
  \                   metals he had seen, since the artificial product had not been
  able to\n                    withstand the heat of the fire. With Albertus we also
  have early evidence\n                    of the application of the sulphur-mercury
  theory in the West. In his\n                        De miner-\n                    alibus
  he referred to the ancient concept of the ex- halations, but he went on to discuss
  a new\n                    theory that attributed the origin of metals to sulphur
  and mercury.Some of the most interesting medieval alchemical treatises date from
  the\n                    late thirteenth and the early fourteenth centuries. The
  Pretiosa Margarita Novella of Petrus Bonus of Ferrara (ca.\n                    1330)
  reflects the influ- ence of\n                    scholasticism in its tripartite
  structure. Argu-\n                        ments in favor of transmutation follow
  the initial refutations,\n                    and these in turn are followed by
  positive answers to the objections. Peter\n                    accepted transmuta-
  tion himself, and he\n                    further stated that the true process might
  easily be learned in an hour. At\n                    the same time he was honest
  enough to admit that he did not know how\n                    to produce gold himself.
  No less influential was the Summa perfectionis which was ascribed to Jabir (Latinized
  as\n                    Geber, late thirteenth century). As in thePrecious Pearl\n
  \                    the sulphur-mercury theory forms the theoretical basis for
  an\n                    understanding of the metals, and the alchemist is informed
  that he must\n                    arrange these substances (understood as ideal
  substances resem- bling most in nature common sulphur and\n                    mercury)
  in perfect proportions for the consummation of the Great\n                    Work.
  Geber described in considerable detail the laboratory processes and\n                    equipment
  of the alchemist. This text reflects an important change in\n                    distillation
  techniques that seems to have originated among twelfth-\n                    and
  thirteenth-century chemists. The intro-\n                        duction of condensation
  at this time made possible the\n                    collection of low boiling fractions
  for the first time. As a result we find\n                    in the literature of
  the mid-twelfth century the first reference to\n                    alcohol. Geber
  confirms this change in equipment and procedure. He\n                    described
  condensation apparatus in detail, and in addition he was the\n                    first
  to give a method for the preparation of a mineral acid—our\n                    nitric
  acid. These substances plus the mixtures of other mineral acids\n                    placed
  powerfulThe alchemy of the late fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries indicates
  an\n                    increasing interest in allegorical and mystical themes.
  Thomas Norton's\n                        Ordinall of Alchimy (1477) is little\n
  \                   concerned with clear-cut de- scriptions of\n                    chemical
  processes or laboratory equip- ment.\n                    Rather, we meet here with
  a lengthy poetical account of the difficult\n                    nature of the work,
  the need of virtue for its successful conclusion, and\n                    veiled
  de- scriptions of the true process.\n                    These and similar texts
  were accompanied by a widespread reaction\n                    against alchemy.
  The unsavory characterization of the alche- mist in medieval literature knows no
  better example\n                    than Chaucer's “Canon's Yeoman's Tale” (ca.
  1390)\n                    while on an official level there were the decrees and
  statutes of Pope John\n                    XXII (1317) and Henry IV of England (1404)
  directed against those who\n                    attempted to multiply gold.Closely
  connected with the widespread medieval interest in transmutation was\n                    a
  parallel trend toward medical chemistry. By the fourteenth century distilla- tion
  and other chemical processes\n                    were in use among Italian physicians
  as a means of identifying the dis- solved substances in the much frequented\n                    mineral
  water spas. A century later Michael Savonarola ordered these\n                    tests
  into a procedural form that became the basis of the later methods of\n                    aqueous
  analyses composed by Gabriel Fallopius and Robert Boyle in the\n                    sixteenth
  and seventeenth centuries.No less important was the medieval physicians' de-\n                        pendence
  on alchemy as a source for new medicines. The Eastern\n                    interest
  in the prolongation of life is evident here. This may be seen as\n                    early
  as the mid- thirteenth century in\n                    the work of Roger Bacon.
  Bacon fully accepted the truth of metallic\n                    transmutation and
  he suggested that this might be utilized to\n                    alleviate the poverty
  of mankind. For Bacon alchemy was a major field\n                    of experimental
  science and he explicitly stated that one of its goals was\n                    the
  search for a length- ened life span. In\n                    the Opus tertium (1267)
  he com- mented that although many physicians used chemical\n                    processes
  to prepare their medicines, very few of them knew how to make\n                    metals
  and fewer still knew how to perform those works which led to the\n                    prolongation
  of life.The same theme occurs in the work of Bacon's younger contemporary, Arnold
  of\n                    Villanova, who argued that alchemy must play an important
  role in the\n                    much needed reform of medicine. In this way new
  remedies and the elixir of\n                    life might be found. The alchemist
  John of Rupescissa (mid-fourteenth\n                    century) insisted that the
  only real purpose of alchemy was to benefit\n                    mankind. His works
  abound with medicinal preparations derived from metals\n                    and
  minerals and he\n                     emphasized distillation processes which seemingly
  separated\n                    pure quintessences from the gross matter of the natural
  substances. It was\n                    this medieval tradition of medical chemistry
  that bore fruit in the\n                    Renaissance “distillation books” of
  Hieronymus\n                    Brunschwig, Con- rad Gesner, and others who\n                    looked
  on alchemy and chemical operations as a basic tool for the\n                    preparation
  of medicines rather than the search for gold.The work of Marsilio Ficino and his
  followers asso-\n                        ciated with the Platonic Academy in Florence
  resulted in a\n                    heightened interest in the mystical texts of
  late antiquity. Ficino himself\n                    translated the Hermetic corpus
  (1463) and this text was of great influence\n                    in the revival
  of Natural Magic, Astrology, and Alchemy. Interest in\n                    these
  subjects is closely intertwined with the course of the Scientific\n                    Revolution.
  Indeed, the sixteenth and the early seventeenth centuries\n                    witnessed
  an ever-quickening concern with alchemy. This new interest\n                    reached
  a peak in the middle years of the latter century before declining.\n                    It
  was just at this time that the major collected editions of alchemical\n                    classics
  were being prepared by Zetzner (1602, 1622, 1659-61), Ashmole\n                    (1652),
  and Manget (1702).The fresh flavor of Renaissance alchemy is perhaps best seen in
  the work of\n                    Paracelsus (1493-1541) and his followers. The iatrochemists
  of the\n                    sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries follow directly
  in the steps\n                    of their medieval predecessors. Like them, they
  ex-\n                        pressed an interest in transmutation, but they were
  primarily\n                    concerned with the medical applications of alchemy.
  For some this meant the\n                    preparation of chemical drugs, but
  for others it meant a mystical\n                    alchemical approach to medicine
  that might apply to macrocosmic as well as\n                    to microcosmic phenomena.Paracelsus
  may be characterized as one of the many nature philosophers of\n                    his
  time, but he differs from others in his emphasis on the importance of\n                    medicine
  and alchemy as bases for a new understanding of the universe.\n                    Characteristic
  of the Paracelsians was their firm opposition to the\n                    dominant
  Aristotelian-Galenic tradition of the universities. They were\n                    unyielding
  in their opposition to Scholasticism which they sought to\n                    replace
  with a philosophy influenced by the recently translated\n                    Neo-Platonic
  and Hermetic texts. The reli-\n                    gious nature of their quest is
  ever present. Man was to seek an\n                    understanding of his Creator
  through the two books of divine revelation;\n                    the Holy Scriptures
  and the Book of Creation—Nature. The\n                    Paracelsians constantly
  called for a new observational approach to\n                    nature, and for
  them chemistry or alchemy seemed to be the best example of\n                    what
  this new science should be. The Paracelsians were quick to offer an alchemicalThe
  search for physical truth in the biblical account of the Creation\n                    focused
  special attention on the forma- tion\n                    of the elements. Paracelsus
  regularly used the Aristotelian elements, but\n                    he also introduced
  the tria\n                    prima—the principles of Salt. Sulphur, and Mercury.\n
  \                   The latter were a modification of the old sulphur- mercury theory
  of the metals, but they differed\n                    from the older concept in
  that they were to apply to all things rather\n                    than being limited
  to the metals alone. The introduction of these\n                    principles had
  the effect of calling into question the whole framework of\n                    ancient
  medicine and natural philosophy since these had been grounded\n                    upon
  the Aristotelian elements. Furthermore, the fact that Paracelsus had\n                    not
  clearly defined his principles tended to make the whole question of\n                        ele-
  mentary substances an ill-defined\n                    one.The Paracelsians sought
  to interpret their world in terms of alchemy or\n                    chemistry.
  On the macrocosmic level they spoke of meteorological events in\n                    terms
  of chemical analogies. On the geocosmic level they argued over\n                    differing
  chemical interpretations of the growth of minerals and the origin\n                    of
  mountain springs. And in their search for agricultural improvements\n                    they
  postulated the importance of dissolved salts as the reason for\n                    the
  beneficial result of fertilizing with manure. For them this was the\n                    familiar
  universal salt of the alchemists.The Paracelsians approached medicine in a similar
  fashion. They felt assured\n                    that their knowledge of the macrocosm
  might be properly applied to the\n                        micro- cosm. Thus, if
  an aerial sulphur\n                    and niter were the cause of thunder and lightning
  in the heavens, the\n                    same aerial effluvia might be inhaled and
  generate burning diseases in\n                    the body. Similarly, chemical
  deposits were formed when the internal archei\n                    governing the
  various organs failed to properly eliminate impurities from\n                    the
  system.The Renaissance was a period of new and violent diseases and the chemical\n
  \                   physicians stated that their new stronger remedies were essential
  for the\n                    proper cures. The work of Paracelsus is reminiscent
  of medie- val distillation chemistry, but by the end of the\n                    century
  iatrochemists were turning less to distilled quintes- sences and more to precipitates
  and\n                    residues in their search for new remedies. In all cases
  it was argued\n                    that alchemical procedures resulted in the separation
  of pure substances\n                    from inactive impurities.In the century
  between 1550 and 1650 conflicts between Paracelsian\n                    iatrochemists
  and more traditional\n                     Galenists were common. The detailed critique
  of the Paracelsian\n                    position by Thomas Erastus became a fun-\n
  \                   damental text for those who opposed the chemical medicine, and
  a\n                    sharp confrontation between chemists and Galenists followed
  in Paris in the\n                    first decade of the seventeenth century. Here
  the debate centered\n                    largely around the possible dangers of
  the new med-\n                        icines. Both Andreas Libavius and Daniel Sennert
  re- viewed this controversy and concluded that the best\n                    course
  for physicians would be to accept the useful remedies of both the\n                    old
  and the new systems. This was the compromise position taken by the\n                    compilers
  of the Pharmacopoeia of the Royal College\n                    of Physi- cians of
  London (1618) and after\n                    this time there were few who denied
  the value of chemistry for medicine.Yet, if the chemists debated with more traditional
  philosophers and\n                    physicians, they disagreed no less among themselves.
  At the opening of the\n                    seventeenth century Robert Fludd defended
  the chemically oriented\n                    views of the Rosicrucians and he described
  his mystical alchemical\n                    interpretation of nature and supernature
  in a series of folio volumes on\n                    the macro- cosm and the microcosm.
  Here he\n                    placed considerable emphasis on an alchemical interpretation
  of the Crea- tion and he utilized mechanical examples to\n                    support
  his views. His work gave support to the alchemical plea for a\n                    new
  science and it was viewed with alarm by Johannes Kepler, Marin\n                    Mersenne,
  and Pierre Gassendi.Jean Baptiste van Helmont was no less a chemical philosopher
  than Fludd, and\n                    he described in detail his transmutation of
  mercury to gold by means of a\n                    small sample of the philosopher's
  stone. Van Helmont sought a chemical\n                    understanding of man through
  medicine, but, in contrast to Fludd and most\n                    Paracelsians,
  he rejected the macrocosm-microcosm analogy. Van Helmont\n                    thus
  was less interested in macrocosmic and geocosmic phenomena than Fludd\n                    and
  he concentrated more on practical and theoretical medical\n                    questions.
  The influence of both authors was considerable in an age\n                    when
  great uncertainty existed about the future course of the new science.\n                    As
  late as 1650 John French could still suggest that only chemistry should\n                    properly
  be considered the basis for a reform of the universities.\n                    Similarly
  John Webster (1654) stated that the new learning must be grounded\n                    principally
  upon the works of Francis Bacon and Robert Fludd.If the chemical philosophy seemed
  a plausible alter-\n                        native to the work of the mechanical
  philosophers in the middle\n                    decades of the seventeenth century,
  this alternative did not remain a\n                    viable one for long. The
  impressive results of the\n                    mechanists—culminating inMany characteristic
  themes of alchemical thought and style are present in\n                    the earliest
  texts that have survived. Both the secrecy and the practical\n                    recipes
  of the metallic craft tradition are evident in the works of\n                    the
  late Hellenistic authors dating from the late third and the fourth\n                    centuries
  A.D. The allegorical and sym-\n                    bolical style of later alchemical
  works is also present here, and\n                    this is a reflection of the
  mystical tenor of the current philosophies and\n                    religions of
  the late Em- pire. The medical theme\n                    is absent in the Greek
  tradi- tion and this\n                    seems to have been derived from Eastern
  sources. First found in Chinese\n                    alchemical works em- phasizing
  the\n                    lengthening of life and the search for immortality, medical
  alchemy was\n                    integrated first into Islamic and then into Western
  alchemy and medicine.There is little doubt that alchemy, understood in its broadest
  sense as a\n                    chemical key to nature, played a significant role
  in the development of the\n                    Scientific Revolution. The claim
  that this mystical science should\n                    replace the Aristotelianism
  and Galenism of the schools was looked on with\n                    dismay by early
  seventeenth- century\n                    mechanists who were forced to clarify
  their\n                     own views in their attacks on authors such as Paracelsus
  and\n                    Robert Fludd. At the same time, however, the chemical and
  alchemical call\n                    for a new science based on new observations
  in nature was important in\n                    a period that witnessed an ever-lessening
  adherence to scholastic\n                    authority. Finally, the Paracelsian
  and iatro-\n                        chemical adoption of the primary goal of the
  medical alchemy of\n                    the Middle Ages resulted in the permanent
  acceptance of chemistry as a\n                    legitimate tool of the physician
  and the pharmacist.The standard source for Greek alchemy is the Catalogue des manuscrits
