  \       Paolo Sarpi\r\n        Pope Urban VIII\r\n        Maffeo Barberini (1568-1644)\r\n
  \     The Barberini were a powerful family, with branches \r\n        in Rome and
  Florence, which had produced several \r\n        cardinals up to that point. \r\n
  \       Maffeo was born into the Florentine branch of the family in 1568. His \r\n
  \       father died when Maffeo was only three years old; his mother insisted \r\n
  \       that he be educated by the Jesuits--first \r\n        in Florence, and later
  in Rome at the Jesuit Collegio \r\n        Romano. Here he lived with his uncle,
  Francesco Barberini, who held \r\n        the high church office of Protonotary
  \r\n        Apostolic. In 1589 he took the degree of doctor of law from the University
  \r\n        of Pisa. \r\n        Maffeo Barberini' s rise in the church hierarchy
  was rapid. In 1601 he \r\n        served as papal legate \r\n        to the court
  of Henri IV, king of France; in 1604 he became archbishop \r\n        of Nazareth
  (an office he obviously fulfilled in absentia since the Holy \r\n        Land was
  under Moslem rule) and took up the post of papal nuncio (lit. \r\n        messenger,
  the papal legate permanently accredited to a civil government) \r\n        to the
  French king; in 1606 he was made a cardinal with the titular church \r\n        of
  St. Peter in Montorio and later St. Onofrio; in 1608 he became bishop \r\n        of
  Spoleto. As bishop, Barberini convened a synod, \r\n        completed the construction
  of one seminary and built two others, and served \r\n        as legate of Bologna
  and prefect \r\n        of the Segnatura di Giustizia. Upon the death of Pope Gregory
  XV, in1623, \r\n        Maffeo Barberini was elected Pope, taking the name of Urban
  VIII. \r\n        During his long papacy, Urban VIII promoted missionary work. He
  formed \r\n        dioceses and vicariats \r\n        in various missionary terrritories
  and founded a college for the training \r\n        of missionaries. He also repealed
  the monopoly on missionary work in China \r\n        and Japan given to the Jesuits
  in 1585, opening these countries to missionaries \r\n        of all orders. In 1639
  he prohibited slavery among the Indians of Brazil, \r\n        Paraguay, and the
  West Indies. \r\n        During this period the temporal power of the papacy was
  in greatest danger \r\n        from the Hapsburg dynasty which ruled much of the
  German speaking region \r\n        of Europe, the Southern Netherlands, and Spain.
  Spanish influence in Italy \r\n        has been on the rise for a century, and the
  kingdom of Naples and Sicily, \r\n        under Spanish rule, lay immediately to
  the South of the Papal State. For \r\n        this reason, Urban VIII favored the
  anti-Hapsburg policy of the French, \r\n        neglecting to support the catholic
  cause in Germany. \r\n        Urban VIII saw to it that the Barberini family benefited
  from his papacy. \r\n        His brother and two nephews were made cardinals and
  given high church \r\n        offices. Other family members were helped by the Pope
  in the acquisition \r\n        of property and titles . He even went so far as to
  make war on Parma, \r\n        Tuscany, Modena, and Venice over a matter \r\n        of
  protocol involving his nephew-cardinals. Pope Urban strenghtened fortifications
  \r\n        and armaments in the papal territories. He lavishly supported artists,
  \r\n        chief among whom was Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini, who beautified St. Peter's
  \r\n        cathedral. Urban had the bronze supporting girders of the Roman Pantheon
  \r\n        melted down and made into cannon and and other objects. This prompted
  \r\n        the epigram: `` What the barbarians did not do the Barberini's did.''
  \r\n        \r\n        Maffeo Barberini was an accomplished man of letters, who
  published several \r\n        volumes of verse. Upon Galileo' s return to Florence,
  in 1610, Barberini \r\n        came to admire Galileo' s intelligence and sharp
  wit. During a court dinner, \r\n        in 1611, at which Galileo defended his view
  on floating bodies, Barberini \r\n        supported Galileo against Cardinal Gonzaga.
  From this point, their patron-client \r\n        relationship flourished until it
  was undone in 1633. Upon Barberini' s \r\n        ascendance of the papal throne,
  in 1623, Galileo came to Rome and had \r\n        six interviews with the new Pope.
  It was at these meetings that Galileo \r\n        was given permission to write
  about the Copernican \r\n        theory, as long as he treated it as a hypothesis.
  After the publication \r\n        of Galileo' s Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief
  Systems of the World, \r\n        in 1632, the patronage relationship was broken.
  It appears that the Pope \r\n        never forgave Galileo for putting the argument
  of God's omnipotence (the \r\n        argument he himelf had put to Galileo in 1623)
  in the mouth of Simplicio, \r\n        the staunch Aristotelian whose arguments
  had been systematically destroyed \r\n        in the previous 400-odd pages. At
  any rate, the Pope resisted all efforts \r\n        to have Galileo pardoned.\r\n
