  The Antikythera Mechanism I
- |
  With Java animations by Bill Casselman
- |2+

- |2+

- |
    
- |
  The main reference for these columns is printed: the monograph,
- |
  cited below, by the famous Yale historian of science Derek
- |
  De Solla Price (other printed references).
- |
  On the web one can find the complete text of his 1959 Scientific American
- |
  article on the subject. E. C. Zeeman, K.B., F.R.S. delivered lectures
- |
  on the topic in 1998 at the University of Texas, San Antonio and
- |
  at Trinity College, Dublin. The 23 transparencies from these lectures are on the web and it's
- |
  almost like being there (see his paper for
- "more detail). DivingBum Enterprises has a \n"
- |
  page with a photograph of the curent installation in the National
- |
  Museum of Archaeology, Athens. Chris Rorres' page
- |
  Spheres and Planetaria on the Drexel University site has a nice photograph
- |
  of Price himself. Rob S. Rice of the University of Pennsylvania has
- |
  posted a very useful paper
- |
  on the subject, from a 1995 U.S. Naval Academy symposium on Naval History.
- |
  A lively sketch of De Solla Price's scientific and human personality
- "can be found in the Foreword, by Robert K. Merton and Eugene Garfield, to one of
  his \n"
- |
  books.
- |
  1. The history of the Mechanism
- |2+

- |
  The Antikythera Mechanism is the name given to an astronomical
- |
  calculating device, measuring about 32 by 16 by 10 cm,
- |
  which was discovered in 1900 in a sunken ship just off the coast
- |
  of Antikythera, an island between Crete and the Greek mainland.
- "Several kinds of evidence point incontrovertibly to around 80 B.C. \n"
- |
  for the date of the shipwreck. The device, made of bronze gears
- |
  fitted in a wooden case, was crushed in the wreck, and parts of
- |
  the faces were lost, "the rest then being coated with a hard
- |
  calcareous deposit at the same time as the metal corroded away
- |
  to a thin core coated with hard metallic salts preserving much
- |
  of the former shape of the bronze" during the almost 2000 years
- |
  it lay submerged. The quotation is from Derek de Solla Price's
- |
  monograph Gears from the Greeks ...  in the 1974 Transactions
- |
  of the American Philosophical Society (Volume 64, part 7).
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  General plan of all gearing, composite
- "diagram from De Solla Price, Transactions of the American \n"
- |
  Philosophical
- "Society Vol 64 No 7 (1974). Reproduced with permission. \n"
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  It is hard to exaggerate the singularity of this device, or
- |
  its importance in forcing a complete re-evaluation of what had
- "been believed about technology in the ancient world. For this box \n"
- |
  contained some 32 gears, assembled into a mechanism that accurately
- "reproduced the motion of the sun and the moon against the \n"
- "background of fixed stars, with a differential giving \n"
- |
  their relative position and hence the phases of the moon. It is
- |
  enough to know that there is no trace of anything like it until
- |
  around 1000 A.D., and that when it was first published there were
- |
  serious suggestions that it had been dropped into the wreck at
- |
  a much later date or even that it was the
- |
  work of alien astronauts.
- |
  The general plan of the gearing could only be drawn after 1971
- |
  when, on De Solla Price's instigation, the remnants of the
- |
  mechanism were viewed with gamma rays, which could penetrate
- |
  the calcareous block in which the gears were embedded. Then
- |
  careful counting of teeth, and examination of the way the
- |
  gears meshed, showed that "the gear ratios could be associated
- |
  with well-known astronomical and calendrical parameters" (Price)
- |
  and allowed the almost complete description of how the device
- |
  must have functioned.
- |2+

- |
  This is the first of two columns on the Antikythera Mechanism. In
- |
  each we will examine one part of the mechanism that has special
- |
  mathematical interest. This month it is the Sun-Moon assembly,
- |
  next month: the Differential Gear.

rawText: "\nThe Antikythera Mechanism I\nWith Java animations by Bill Casselman\n\n\n  \nThe
  main reference for these columns is printed: the monograph,\ncited below, by the
  famous Yale historian of science Derek\nDe Solla Price (other printed references).\nOn
  the web one can find the complete text of his 1959 Scientific American\narticle
  on the subject. E. C. Zeeman, K.B., F.R.S. delivered lectures\non the topic in 1998
  at the University of Texas, San Antonio and\nat Trinity College, Dublin. The 23
  transparencies from these lectures are on the web and it's\nalmost like being there
  (see his paper for\nmore detail). DivingBum Enterprises has a \npage with a photograph
  of the curent installation in the National\nMuseum of Archaeology, Athens. Chris
  Rorres' page\nSpheres and Planetaria on the Drexel University site has a nice photograph\nof
  Price himself. Rob S. Rice of the University of Pennsylvania has\nposted a very
  useful paper\non the subject, from a 1995 U.S. Naval Academy symposium on Naval
  History.\nA lively sketch of De Solla Price's scientific and human personality\ncan
  be found in the Foreword, by Robert K. Merton and Eugene Garfield, to one of his
  \nbooks.\n1. The history of the Mechanism\n\nThe Antikythera Mechanism is the name
  given to an astronomical\ncalculating device, measuring about 32 by 16 by 10 cm,\nwhich
  was discovered in 1900 in a sunken ship just off the coast\nof Antikythera, an island
  between Crete and the Greek mainland.\nSeveral kinds of evidence point incontrovertibly
  to around 80 B.C. \nfor the date of the shipwreck. The device, made of bronze gears\nfitted
  in a wooden case, was crushed in the wreck, and parts of\nthe faces were lost, \"the
  rest then being coated with a hard\ncalcareous deposit at the same time as the metal
  corroded away\nto a thin core coated with hard metallic salts preserving much\nof
  the former shape of the bronze\" during the almost 2000 years\nit lay submerged.
  The quotation is from Derek de Solla Price's\nmonograph Gears from the Greeks ...
  \ in the 1974 Transactions\nof the American Philosophical Society (Volume 64, part
  7).\n\n\nGeneral plan of all gearing, composite\ndiagram from De Solla Price, Transactions
  of the American \nPhilosophical\nSociety Vol 64 No 7 (1974). Reproduced with permission.
  \n\n\nIt is hard to exaggerate the singularity of this device, or\nits importance
  in forcing a complete re-evaluation of what had\nbeen believed about technology
  in the ancient world. For this box \ncontained some 32 gears, assembled into a mechanism
  that accurately\nreproduced the motion of the sun and the moon against the \nbackground
  of fixed stars, with a differential giving \ntheir relative position and hence the
  phases of the moon. It is\nenough to know that there is no trace of anything like
  it until\naround 1000 A.D., and that when it was first published there were\nserious
  suggestions that it had been dropped into the wreck at\na much later date or even
  that it was the\nwork of alien astronauts.\nThe general plan of the gearing could
  only be drawn after 1971\nwhen, on De Solla Price's instigation, the remnants of
  the\nmechanism were viewed with gamma rays, which could penetrate\nthe calcareous
  block in which the gears were embedded. Then\ncareful counting of teeth, and examination
  of the way the\ngears meshed, showed that \"the gear ratios could be associated\nwith
  well-known astronomical and calendrical parameters\" (Price)\nand allowed the almost
  complete description of how the device\nmust have functioned.\n\nThis is the first
  of two columns on the Antikythera Mechanism. In\neach we will examine one part of
  the mechanism that has special\nmathematical interest. This month it is the Sun-Moon
  assembly,\nnext month: the Differential Gear.\n\n\n\n\n--Tony Phillips\nSUNY at
