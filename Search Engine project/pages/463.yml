                  Just as Ted Cruz has become a serious threat for the nomination, we learn that he faces a gigantic obstacle that could doom his campaign. In the view of the New York Times, he has one helluva charm deficit.

                  The paper pulled out the stops in depicting the Texas senator as socially awkward and not very likable. As the Times put it, “now comes the hard part: making friends.” Now personality is part of politics and undoubtedly fair game. And no one would accuse Cruz of being a warm and fuzzy guy. He has a combative public personality. He’s alienated some of his Republican colleagues with tough tactics, filibusters, a government shutdown and sometimes harsh rhetoric. But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t have a more approachable side. And the Times story seems to me to vacuum up every available negative dust ball to paint a dark picture. It begins with the choice of opening anecdote: “Senator Ted Cruz had been at it for several minutes, offering handshakes and uneasy smiles, when he encountered an apparent holdout in the crowd.” The haughty holdout? A 3-year-old boy, who didn’t respond to the senator’s questions about toy dinosaurs and fire trucks. As if that’s never happened to any other politician. “The article began by mocking a shy little boy,” a Cruz adviser tells me. He described Cruz as “a great guy to hang out with, a night owl who likes to laugh and have fun. People don’t see that side of him. He’s actually a little nerdy.” Cruz did say in a debate—dutifully noted by the Times—that “if you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy. But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.” The adviser acknowledged that this was a mistake. I haven’t hung out with Cruz, but I’ve chatted with him enough to know that his political passion is leavened by an easy sense of humor. This portrait matters because such impressions tend to stick as the media develop shorthand for each candidate. Think back to Barack Obama’s “you’re likable enough, Hillary.” And Cruz’s surge in the polls is guaranteed to intensify his media scrutiny. Look at the phraseology in this story. As a college debating champion, Cruz “seems to be taking an almost academic approach to achieving likability.” Because it just don’t come naturally to him. During stump speeches, “a Cruz performance can appear obsessively calibrated, down to the dramatic pauses deployed identically from event to event.” Any reporter who follows a candidate on the road   “He occasionally tells uncomfortable sex jokes.” Oh-kay. An aide helps maneuver him when fans want pictures, “calling to mind the television show ‘Veep.’” So Cruz is as big a phony as the Julia Louis-Dreyfus character! Got it? The story even recycles a nine-month-old incident which was a bum rap at the time. Cruz was talking to a New Hampshire crowd when a 3-year-old girl repeated his line, “The world is on fire?” For all the mocking headlines about CRUZ FRIGHTENS TODDLER, the girl’s mom insisted that she was not scared—and is now working for the campaign. Perhaps it’s just a coincidence, but a Times editorial over the weekend described him as “the bellicose senator from Texas” in ripping him for saying he would carpet-bomb ISIS, on the grounds that the military doesn’t really do such bombing.   A very different take by the Washington Post’s Chris Cillizza, who says Cruz “has the most direct route to the Republican presidential nomination”—and that includes Donald Trump. Among the reasons: Cruz is positioned as the most conservative candidate, he’s raised the second highest amount of money ($65 million), and he has a very strong shot at winning Iowa. That was underscored when the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll gave Cruz a 31 to 21 percent lead over Donald Trump in the state, although the Fox News poll out yesterday gives Cruz a 2-point edge. That, in turn, means Iowa’s famously nice voters don’t buy the image of Cruz depicted in the Times—or want someone who will in fact blow up the system. The voters will have to decide about Cruz’s persona and whether he wears well over the course of a campaign. But let’s not push the stereotype that he makes little kids cringe.

- "\t\t\t\tJust as Ted Cruz has become a serious threat for the nomination, we learn
  that he faces a gigantic obstacle that could doom his campaign. In the view of the
  New York Times, he has one helluva charm deficit.The paper pulled out the stops
  in depicting the Texas senator as socially awkward and not very likable. As the
  Times put it, “now comes the hard part: making friends.” Now personality is part
  of politics and undoubtedly fair game. And no one would accuse Cruz of being a warm
  and fuzzy guy. He has a combative public personality. He’s alienated some of his
  Republican colleagues with tough tactics, filibusters, a government shutdown and
  sometimes harsh rhetoric. But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t have a more approachable
  side. And the Times story seems to me to vacuum up every available negative dust
  ball to paint a dark picture. It begins with the choice of opening anecdote: “Senator
  Ted Cruz had been at it for several minutes, offering handshakes and uneasy smiles,
  when he encountered an apparent holdout in the crowd.” The haughty holdout? A 3-year-old
  boy, who didn’t respond to the senator’s questions about toy dinosaurs and fire
  trucks. As if that’s never happened to any other politician. “The article began
  by mocking a shy little boy,” a Cruz adviser tells me. He described Cruz as “a great
  guy to hang out with, a night owl who likes to laugh and have fun. People don’t
  see that side of him. He’s actually a little nerdy.” Cruz did say in a debate—dutifully
  noted by the Times—that “if you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that
  guy. But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will
  get you home.” The adviser acknowledged that this was a mistake. I haven’t hung
  out with Cruz, but I’ve chatted with him enough to know that his political passion
  is leavened by an easy sense of humor. This portrait matters because such impressions
  tend to stick as the media develop shorthand for each candidate. Think back to Barack
  Obama’s “you’re likable enough, Hillary.” And Cruz’s surge in the polls is guaranteed
  to intensify his media scrutiny. Look at the phraseology in this story. As a college
  debating champion, Cruz “seems to be taking an almost academic approach to achieving
  likability.” Because it just don’t come naturally to him. During stump speeches,
  “a Cruz performance can appear obsessively calibrated, down to the dramatic pauses
  deployed identically from event to event.” Any reporter who follows a candidate
  on the road   “He occasionally tells uncomfortable sex jokes.” Oh-kay. An aide helps
  maneuver him when fans want pictures, “calling to mind the television show ‘Veep.’”
  So Cruz is as big a phony as the Julia Louis-Dreyfus character! Got it? The story
  even recycles a nine-month-old incident which was a bum rap at the time. Cruz was
  talking to a New Hampshire crowd when a 3-year-old girl repeated his line, “The
  world is on fire?” For all the mocking headlines about CRUZ FRIGHTENS TODDLER, the
  girl’s mom insisted that she was not scared—and is now working for the campaign.
  Perhaps it’s just a coincidence, but a Times editorial over the weekend described
  him as “the bellicose senator from Texas” in ripping him for saying he would carpet-bomb
  ISIS, on the grounds that the military doesn’t really do such bombing.   A very
  different take by the Washington Post’s Chris Cillizza, who says Cruz “has the most
  direct route to the Republican presidential nomination”—and that includes Donald
  Trump. Among the reasons: Cruz is positioned as the most conservative candidate,
  he’s raised the second highest amount of money ($65 million), and he has a very
  strong shot at winning Iowa. That was underscored when the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg
  poll gave Cruz a 31 to 21 percent lead over Donald Trump in the state, although
  the Fox News poll out yesterday gives Cruz a 2-point edge. That, in turn, means
  Iowa’s famously nice voters don’t buy the image of Cruz depicted in the Times—or
  want someone who will in fact blow up the system. The voters will have to decide
  about Cruz’s persona and whether he wears well over the course of a campaign. But
  let’s not push the stereotype that he makes little kids cringe.Howard Kurtz is a

  \               Just as Ted Cruz has become a serious threat for the nomination,
  we learn that he faces a gigantic obstacle that could doom his campaign. In the
  view of the New York Times, he has one helluva charm deficit.\n                \n
  \               \r\n\n            \n                The paper pulled out the stops
  in depicting the Texas senator as socially awkward and not very likable. As the
  Times put it, “now comes the hard part: making friends.” Now personality is part
  of politics and undoubtedly fair game. And no one would accuse Cruz of being a warm
  and fuzzy guy. He has a combative public personality. He’s alienated some of his
  Republican colleagues with tough tactics, filibusters, a government shutdown and
  sometimes harsh rhetoric. But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t have a more approachable
  side. And the Times story seems to me to vacuum up every available negative dust
  ball to paint a dark picture. It begins with the choice of opening anecdote: “Senator
  Ted Cruz had been at it for several minutes, offering handshakes and uneasy smiles,
  when he encountered an apparent holdout in the crowd.” The haughty holdout? A 3-year-old
  boy, who didn’t respond to the senator’s questions about toy dinosaurs and fire
  trucks. As if that’s never happened to any other politician. “The article began
  by mocking a shy little boy,” a Cruz adviser tells me. He described Cruz as “a great
  guy to hang out with, a night owl who likes to laugh and have fun. People don’t
  see that side of him. He’s actually a little nerdy.” Cruz did say in a debate—dutifully
  noted by the Times—that “if you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that
  guy. But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will
  get you home.” The adviser acknowledged that this was a mistake. I haven’t hung
  out with Cruz, but I’ve chatted with him enough to know that his political passion
  is leavened by an easy sense of humor. This portrait matters because such impressions
  tend to stick as the media develop shorthand for each candidate. Think back to Barack
  Obama’s “you’re likable enough, Hillary.” And Cruz’s surge in the polls is guaranteed
  to intensify his media scrutiny. Look at the phraseology in this story. As a college
  debating champion, Cruz “seems to be taking an almost academic approach to achieving
  likability.” Because it just don’t come naturally to him. During stump speeches,
  “a Cruz performance can appear obsessively calibrated, down to the dramatic pauses
  deployed identically from event to event.” Any reporter who follows a candidate
  on the road   “He occasionally tells uncomfortable sex jokes.” Oh-kay. An aide helps
  maneuver him when fans want pictures, “calling to mind the television show ‘Veep.’”
  So Cruz is as big a phony as the Julia Louis-Dreyfus character! Got it? The story
  even recycles a nine-month-old incident which was a bum rap at the time. Cruz was
  talking to a New Hampshire crowd when a 3-year-old girl repeated his line, “The
  world is on fire?” For all the mocking headlines about CRUZ FRIGHTENS TODDLER, the
  girl’s mom insisted that she was not scared—and is now working for the campaign.
  Perhaps it’s just a coincidence, but a Times editorial over the weekend described
  him as “the bellicose senator from Texas” in ripping him for saying he would carpet-bomb
  ISIS, on the grounds that the military doesn’t really do such bombing.   A very
  different take by the Washington Post’s Chris Cillizza, who says Cruz “has the most
  direct route to the Republican presidential nomination”—and that includes Donald
  Trump. Among the reasons: Cruz is positioned as the most conservative candidate,
  he’s raised the second highest amount of money ($65 million), and he has a very
  strong shot at winning Iowa. That was underscored when the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg
  poll gave Cruz a 31 to 21 percent lead over Donald Trump in the state, although
  the Fox News poll out yesterday gives Cruz a 2-point edge. That, in turn, means
  Iowa’s famously nice voters don’t buy the image of Cruz depicted in the Times—or
  want someone who will in fact blow up the system. The voters will have to decide
  about Cruz’s persona and whether he wears well over the course of a campaign. But
  let’s not push the stereotype that he makes little kids cringe.\n                \n

  \           \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tJust as Ted Cruz has become a serious threat
  for the nomination, we learn that he faces a gigantic obstacle that could doom his
  campaign. In the view of the New York Times, he has one helluva charm deficit.The
  paper pulled out the stops in depicting the Texas senator as socially awkward and
  not very likable. As the Times put it, “now comes the hard part: making friends.”
  Now personality is part of politics and undoubtedly fair game. And no one would
  accuse Cruz of being a warm and fuzzy guy. He has a combative public personality.
  He’s alienated some of his Republican colleagues with tough tactics, filibusters,
  a government shutdown and sometimes harsh rhetoric. But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t
  have a more approachable side. And the Times story seems to me to vacuum up every
  available negative dust ball to paint a dark picture. It begins with the choice
  of opening anecdote: “Senator Ted Cruz had been at it for several minutes, offering
  handshakes and uneasy smiles, when he encountered an apparent holdout in the crowd.”
  The haughty holdout? A 3-year-old boy, who didn’t respond to the senator’s questions
  about toy dinosaurs and fire trucks. As if that’s never happened to any other politician.
  “The article began by mocking a shy little boy,” a Cruz adviser tells me. He described
  Cruz as “a great guy to hang out with, a night owl who likes to laugh and have fun.
  People don’t see that side of him. He’s actually a little nerdy.” Cruz did say in
  a debate—dutifully noted by the Times—that “if you want someone to grab a beer with,
  I may not be that guy. But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the
  job done and I will get you home.” The adviser acknowledged that this was a mistake.
  I haven’t hung out with Cruz, but I’ve chatted with him enough to know that his
  political passion is leavened by an easy sense of humor. This portrait matters because
  such impressions tend to stick as the media develop shorthand for each candidate.
  Think back to Barack Obama’s “you’re likable enough, Hillary.” And Cruz’s surge
  in the polls is guaranteed to intensify his media scrutiny. Look at the phraseology
  in this story. As a college debating champion, Cruz “seems to be taking an almost
  academic approach to achieving likability.” Because it just don’t come naturally
  to him. During stump speeches, “a Cruz performance can appear obsessively calibrated,
  down to the dramatic pauses deployed identically from event to event.” Any reporter
  who follows a candidate on the road   “He occasionally tells uncomfortable sex jokes.”
  Oh-kay. An aide helps maneuver him when fans want pictures, “calling to mind the
  television show ‘Veep.’” So Cruz is as big a phony as the Julia Louis-Dreyfus character!
  Got it? The story even recycles a nine-month-old incident which was a bum rap at
  the time. Cruz was talking to a New Hampshire crowd when a 3-year-old girl repeated
  his line, “The world is on fire?” For all the mocking headlines about CRUZ FRIGHTENS
  TODDLER, the girl’s mom insisted that she was not scared—and is now working for
  the campaign. Perhaps it’s just a coincidence, but a Times editorial over the weekend
  described him as “the bellicose senator from Texas” in ripping him for saying he
  would carpet-bomb ISIS, on the grounds that the military doesn’t really do such
  bombing.   A very different take by the Washington Post’s Chris Cillizza, who says
  Cruz “has the most direct route to the Republican presidential nomination”—and that
  includes Donald Trump. Among the reasons: Cruz is positioned as the most conservative
  candidate, he’s raised the second highest amount of money ($65 million), and he
  has a very strong shot at winning Iowa. That was underscored when the Des Moines
  Register/Bloomberg poll gave Cruz a 31 to 21 percent lead over Donald Trump in the
  state, although the Fox News poll out yesterday gives Cruz a 2-point edge. That,
  in turn, means Iowa’s famously nice voters don’t buy the image of Cruz depicted
  in the Times—or want someone who will in fact blow up the system. The voters will
  have to decide about Cruz’s persona and whether he wears well over the course of
  a campaign. But let’s not push the stereotype that he makes little kids cringe.Howard
