- "                Today, 2K Games announced the formation of a new internal studio,
  Hangar 13, lead by Haden Blackman -- who's well known for his work at LucasArts
  on The Force Unleashed, for which he won a Writers' Guild of America award.\r\n"
- |
  While Blackman was unable to talk specifics about the project that Hangar 13 has taken on, it's a story-driven triple-A game for next-gen consoles -- one that focuses on player stories as much or more than those created by the developers.

- "2K's willingness to invest in a big console game was instrumental to his joining
  the company, he told Gamasutra.\r\n"
- "\"The things that drew me here first and foremost were 2K's library, and that 2K
  makes the kind of games I want to play,\" he says. That pairs well, he says, with
  the publisher's commitment to high-quality, triple-A games: \"It's always a conversation
  about the quality of the game here.\"\r\n"
- "This brand new interview delves into how Blackman sees triple-A game narrative
  evolving, what he expects from games, and how he plans to steer the studio to create
  the sort of title that will push the boundaries of triple-A game development in
  its emphasis on delivering a player-driven story.\r\n"
- "Can you tell me about the project, to frame the conversation?\r\n"
- "Haden Blackman: Two things that kept coming up that were really important to me
  was, one, the fact that we could really advance and start pushing on the player-driven
  story. And when I say that, I don't necessarily mean the narrative, although that's
  one component of it.\r\n"
- "What I mean is the story we tell each other about the game that we've played. The
  stories that we swap about how we've approached certain challenges in the game;
  how the world, or the characters, or the narrative might have evolved based on our
  decisions, the type of characters that we played, all those things.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "\"But for me, making the player a co-author in the experience is hugely important,
  and it's something that I wanted to explore more and more.\"\r\n"

- "And there are obviously hundreds and hundreds of ways to deliver on that. But for
  me, making the player a co-author in the experience is hugely important, and it's
  something that I wanted to explore more and more, and I think we have that opportunity
  here.\r\n"
- "The second thing about the studio -- in conversations with 2K that I expressed
  that I wanted to do and they were supportive of -- was developing proprietary tech.
  Throughout my career, I've worked on over 20 games. Of those, I think only one was
  not proprietary tech.\r\n"
- "So that's my background, that's my experience, that's what I love -- to work on
  games that are built on proprietary tech, because it gives us the opportunity to
  build tech specifically to deliver on the game vision, and we're not spending time
  trying to shoehorn a design into existing tech, or a vision into existing tech,
  or trying to retrofit technology that already exists to fit the vision of the game
  that we want to create. So those are kind of the big things that we're pushing on
  here: the idea that every player's story is unique, and proprietary tech.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "This is an extremely broad question, but they're going to be a bit broad, I think,
  because we can't talk about your project in a lot of specificity. What do you think
  of the state of storytelling in triple-A games? What do you think it's doing, or
  could do?\r\n"
- "HB: I would answer this question almost the same way five years ago -- I think
  it's an incredibly vibrant and exciting time for storytelling in games. As long
  as you're looking at it not through the lens of telling a linear, cinematic narrative
  -- I think there's always going to be a place for that in games, and I think there
  will always be games that do that. But where I think things are most exciting are
  games that are, within a framework of a strong narrative -- that might even be linear
  -- creating opportunities for the player to add their own \"plot points,\" for lack
  of a better term, to that.\r\n"
- "So I look at something like [Shadow of] Mordor, right? Which I think did a great
  job with that -- giving you a linear narrative, for the most part, that has a beginning,
  a middle, and an end, but there are all these opportunities within that to put your
  own stamp on that.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "\"I think it's a really exciting time, because people are taking those chances,
  and are taking those risks, and are trying to build more systemic storytelling into
  games.\"\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "And I think that the story most people will talk about is that story -- the story
  about the orcs that they vanquished, and who rose to power, and how they approached
  certain missions, and how often they branded orcs, and all that kind of stuff. From
  that standpoint, I think it's a really exciting time, because people are taking
  those chances, and are taking those risks, and are trying to build more systemic
  storytelling into games.\r\n"
- "On the strictly \"telling a linear narrative\" side, obviously as technology advances,
  with better facial performances, we're better able to tell more compelling stories
  in some ways, and more emotional stories, which I think has been great. When I look
  at a game like The Last of Us, which was incredibly emotional on a lot of different
  levels, and I think a lot of that was based on the performance of their characters.\r\n"
- "I don't think there's a better time to be developing games, especially if you're
  interested in the art of storytelling, especially because you have so much to work
  with. But again, the thing as a storyteller that's exciting to me, is relinquishing
  some of that authorship, and saying that we're going to author part of the story
  but the player's going to author part of it as well.\r\n"
- "Now, that's really interesting to me, because I've seen a lot of people discuss
  this topic. But one thing I don't see specifically addressed is the quite different
  nature of an authored story versus one that comes out of player actions. I think
  there are probably ways to get those close -- in terms of things like how you present
  information to the player. I was wondering what your thoughts on that are.\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "\"The distinction between where the developer's narrative and their authorship
  begins and ends blurs with the players.\"\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "HB: I honestly think that it is blurring -- in some of the games that are doing
  this well. The distinction between where the developer's narrative and their authorship
  begins and ends blurs with the players.\r\n"
- "If you look at something like Dragon Age Inquisition -- yes, I can sit down, and
  any one person I talk to, we have a lot of choices that we made in common. But even
  within that, there's nuance. And especially if you've played the two previous Dragon
  Ages, and you're bringing that data over, there's going to be a lot of choices that
  make that experience your own. So I look at a company like BioWare that's already
  advancing in this direction, which is really exciting and cool.\r\n"
- "For us, we want to do it in different ways than other companies out there, and
  we want to try and do it at every level. The thing we talk about a lot with the
  team is trying to hit it on every tier. I want people to be able to sit down and
  talk about a very specific piece of content in the game. Let's use, for a hypothetical,
  a mission, for example, or a quest -- to say, \"How did you approach that mission?\"
  and be able to swap stories and have every person that describes how they approached
  that mission describe it in a different way. That's the aspirational goal.\r\n"
- "And then you go to the minute-to-minute, so if that's moment-to-moment combat,
  it's how I approached combat? So minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour, and then over the
  course of the life of the game, all those things should add up to some meaningful
  differences in your experience -- that go beyond just branching stories, for example.\r\n"
- "There are some obvious answers to this, but I'm curious: How is proprietary tech
  going to help you achieve this goal?\r\n"
- "HB: I think it does on every level. We need to make sure that we're investing in
  tools that our designers can use to create and iterate on content quickly. And it's
  not so much the volume, it's the quality, and making sure it's the right content
  for what we're building.\r\n"
- "Making sure that we have the tools to build immersive worlds. Because if you don't
  believe in the world, you're not going to care about your impact on it, or what
  happens to it, or with it, over time. There's obviously investments we can make
  in A.I. to make the world more believable as well.\r\n"
- "But I think maybe the area of greatest impact is in tying in game systems with
  game system design. So making sure that we are building smart under-the-hood systems
  that are not based on heavily scripted or heavily authored content, but they're
  more pulling on different components, or parts. I know I'm being very vague and
  general. Making sure that you have a lot of different levers that the player can
  pull, maybe even inadvertently, to change their experience, if that makes any sense.\r\n"
- "It does, and it leads me to a question I'm very curious about. One of the impediments
  to player stories in games is that, in many popular games, the only interaction
  the player can have with the world that is meaningful and rich is through violence
  of some sort. How do you see that, and what kind of expressions can a player have
  in a world, to help shape a story?\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "\"I think that trying to find more and more ways to interact with the world is
  a noble cause.\"\r\n"
- "\r\n"
- "HB: Again, I don't want to shy away from action, and I think that's always going
  to be a big part of gaming, and certainly for me, the games that I enjoy playing
  have a high degree of action in them. So that will always be part of it. I think
  that trying to find more and more ways to interact with the world is a noble cause,
  for lack of a better term, for game developers, and it's definitely something we're
  interested in exploring here, and we've been discussing it.\r\n"
- "I think there are examples out there of people who are doing it. But so far, we've
  really kind of just scratched the surface. And there are a lot of reasons for that.
  One is, there's a certain gratification that comes from playing action games, and
  I don't want to lose that -- a certain thrill from playing games with a high degree
  of action, and as I said, those are games that I enjoy playing. \r\n"
- "And also, it's just hard. It's really difficult challenge to make somebody care
  for a character that they might want to romance, for example. And some teams are
  doing that, and doing that well.\r\n"
- "I think there are a lot of other opportunities, too, to pull on other emotions.
  In the past, it's really easy to get people worked up and dislike a character in
  a game, or dislike an enemy. How do you get them to like a character? That's harder
  and people have been working on that.\r\n"
- "I think we want to continue to explore that, and that's certainly something we're
  looking at here. How do you get people to feel sadness? How do you get people to
  feel loss, in a game? Is that something you should pursue? We're asking those questions
  right now, because of the nature of some of the stuff we're working on.\r\n"

- 'Today, 2K Games announced the formation of a new internal studio, Hangar 13, lead
  by Haden Blackman -- who''s well known for his work at LucasArts on The Force Unleashed,
  for which he won a Writers'' Guild of America award.While Blackman was unable to
  talk specifics about the project that Hangar 13 has taken on, it''s a story-driven
  triple-A game for next-gen consoles -- one that focuses on player stories as much
  or more than those created by the developers.2K''s willingness to invest in a big
  console game was instrumental to his joining the company, he told Gamasutra."The
  things that drew me here first and foremost were 2K''s library, and that 2K makes
  the kind of games I want to play," he says. That pairs well, he says, with the publisher''s
  commitment to high-quality, triple-A games: "It''s always a conversation about the
  quality of the game here."This brand new interview delves into how Blackman sees
  triple-A game narrative evolving, what he expects from games, and how he plans to
  steer the studio to create the sort of title that will push the boundaries of triple-A
  game development in its emphasis on delivering a player-driven story.Can you tell
  me about the project, to frame the conversation?Haden Blackman: Two things that
  kept coming up that were really important to me was, one, the fact that we could
  really advance and start pushing on the player-driven story. And when I say that,
  I don''t necessarily mean the narrative, although that''s one component of it.What
  I mean is the story we tell each other about the game that we''ve played. The stories
  that we swap about how we''ve approached certain challenges in the game; how the
  world, or the characters, or the narrative might have evolved based on our decisions,
  the type of characters that we played, all those things.And there are obviously
  hundreds and hundreds of ways to deliver on that. But for me, making the player
  a co-author in the experience is hugely important, and it''s something that I wanted
  to explore more and more, and I think we have that opportunity here.The second thing
  about the studio -- in conversations with 2K that I expressed that I wanted to do
  and they were supportive of -- was developing proprietary tech. Throughout my career,
  I''ve worked on over 20 games. Of those, I think only one was not proprietary tech.So
  that''s my background, that''s my experience, that''s what I love -- to work on
  games that are built on proprietary tech, because it gives us the opportunity to
  build tech specifically to deliver on the game vision, and we''re not spending time
  trying to shoehorn a design into existing tech, or a vision into existing tech,
  or trying to retrofit technology that already exists to fit the vision of the game
  that we want to create. So those are kind of the big things that we''re pushing
  on here: the idea that every player''s story is unique, and proprietary tech.This
  is an extremely broad question, but they''re going to be a bit broad, I think, because
  we can''t talk about your project in a lot of specificity. What do you think of
  the state of storytelling in triple-A games? What do you think it''s doing, or could
  do?HB: I would answer this question almost the same way five years ago -- I think
  it''s an incredibly vibrant and exciting time for storytelling in games. As long
  as you''re looking at it not through the lens of telling a linear, cinematic narrative
  -- I think there''s always going to be a place for that in games, and I think there
  will always be games that do that. But where I think things are most exciting are
  games that are, within a framework of a strong narrative -- that might even be linear
  -- creating opportunities for the player to add their own "plot points," for lack
  of a better term, to that.So I look at something like [Shadow of] Mordor, right?
  Which I think did a great job with that -- giving you a linear narrative, for the
  most part, that has a beginning, a middle, and an end, but there are all these opportunities
  within that to put your own stamp on that.And I think that the story most people
  will talk about is that story -- the story about the orcs that they vanquished,
  and who rose to power, and how they approached certain missions, and how often they
  branded orcs, and all that kind of stuff. From that standpoint, I think it''s a
  really exciting time, because people are taking those chances, and are taking those
  risks, and are trying to build more systemic storytelling into games.On the strictly
  "telling a linear narrative" side, obviously as technology advances, with better
  facial performances, we''re better able to tell more compelling stories in some
  ways, and more emotional stories, which I think has been great. When I look at a
  game like The Last of Us, which was incredibly emotional on a lot of different levels,
  and I think a lot of that was based on the performance of their characters.I don''t
  think there''s a better time to be developing games, especially if you''re interested
  in the art of storytelling, especially because you have so much to work with. But
  again, the thing as a storyteller that''s exciting to me, is relinquishing some
  of that authorship, and saying that we''re going to author part of the story but
  the player''s going to author part of it as well.Now, that''s really interesting
  to me, because I''ve seen a lot of people discuss this topic. But one thing I don''t
  see specifically addressed is the quite different nature of an authored story versus
  one that comes out of player actions. I think there are probably ways to get those
  close -- in terms of things like how you present information to the player. I was
  wondering what your thoughts on that are.HB: I honestly think that it is blurring
  -- in some of the games that are doing this well. The distinction between where
  the developer''s narrative and their authorship begins and ends blurs with the players.If
  you look at something like Dragon Age Inquisition -- yes, I can sit down, and any
  one person I talk to, we have a lot of choices that we made in common. But even
  within that, there''s nuance. And especially if you''ve played the two previous
  Dragon Ages, and you''re bringing that data over, there''s going to be a lot of
  choices that make that experience your own. So I look at a company like BioWare
  that''s already advancing in this direction, which is really exciting and cool.For
  us, we want to do it in different ways than other companies out there, and we want
  to try and do it at every level. The thing we talk about a lot with the team is
  trying to hit it on every tier. I want people to be able to sit down and talk about
  a very specific piece of content in the game. Let''s use, for a hypothetical, a
  mission, for example, or a quest -- to say, "How did you approach that mission?"
  and be able to swap stories and have every person that describes how they approached
  that mission describe it in a different way. That''s the aspirational goal.And then
  you go to the minute-to-minute, so if that''s moment-to-moment combat, it''s how
  I approached combat? So minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour, and then over the course
  of the life of the game, all those things should add up to some meaningful differences
  in your experience -- that go beyond just branching stories, for example.There are
  some obvious answers to this, but I''m curious: How is proprietary tech going to
  help you achieve this goal?HB: I think it does on every level. We need to make sure
  that we''re investing in tools that our designers can use to create and iterate
  on content quickly. And it''s not so much the volume, it''s the quality, and making
  sure it''s the right content for what we''re building.Making sure that we have the
  tools to build immersive worlds. Because if you don''t believe in the world, you''re
  not going to care about your impact on it, or what happens to it, or with it, over
  time. There''s obviously investments we can make in A.I. to make the world more
  believable as well.But I think maybe the area of greatest impact is in tying in
  game systems with game system design. So making sure that we are building smart
  under-the-hood systems that are not based on heavily scripted or heavily authored
  content, but they''re more pulling on different components, or parts. I know I''m
  being very vague and general. Making sure that you have a lot of different levers
  that the player can pull, maybe even inadvertently, to change their experience,
  if that makes any sense.It does, and it leads me to a question I''m very curious
  about. One of the impediments to player stories in games is that, in many popular
  games, the only interaction the player can have with the world that is meaningful
  and rich is through violence of some sort. How do you see that, and what kind of
  expressions can a player have in a world, to help shape a story?HB: Again, I don''t
  want to shy away from action, and I think that''s always going to be a big part
  of gaming, and certainly for me, the games that I enjoy playing have a high degree
  of action in them. So that will always be part of it. I think that trying to find
  more and more ways to interact with the world is a noble cause, for lack of a better
  term, for game developers, and it''s definitely something we''re interested in exploring
  here, and we''ve been discussing it.I think there are examples out there of people
  who are doing it. But so far, we''ve really kind of just scratched the surface.
  And there are a lot of reasons for that. One is, there''s a certain gratification
  that comes from playing action games, and I don''t want to lose that -- a certain
  thrill from playing games with a high degree of action, and as I said, those are
  games that I enjoy playing. And also, it''s just hard. It''s really difficult challenge
  to make somebody care for a character that they might want to romance, for example.
  And some teams are doing that, and doing that well.I think there are a lot of other
  opportunities, too, to pull on other emotions. In the past, it''s really easy to
  get people worked up and dislike a character in a game, or dislike an enemy. How
  do you get them to like a character? That''s harder and people have been working
  on that.I think we want to continue to explore that, and that''s certainly something
  we''re looking at here. How do you get people to feel sadness? How do you get people
  to feel loss, in a game? Is that something you should pursue? We''re asking those
  questions right now, because of the nature of some of the stuff we''re working on.'

  \                \n                Today, 2K Games announced the formation of a
  new internal studio, Hangar 13, lead by Haden Blackman -- who's well known for his
  work at LucasArts on The Force Unleashed, for which he won a Writers' Guild of America
  award.\r\nWhile Blackman was unable to talk specifics about the project that Hangar
  13 has taken on, it's a story-driven triple-A game for next-gen consoles -- one
  that focuses on player stories as much or more than those created by the developers.\n
  \               \n                    \n                                                                                    \n\n
  \n  googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-rec1');\n \n\n                                                                        \n
  \               \n                \r\n2K's willingness to invest in a big console
  game was instrumental to his joining the company, he told Gamasutra.\r\n\"The things
  that drew me here first and foremost were 2K's library, and that 2K makes the kind
  of games I want to play,\" he says. That pairs well, he says, with the publisher's
  commitment to high-quality, triple-A games: \"It's always a conversation about the
  quality of the game here.\"\r\nThis brand new interview delves into how Blackman
  sees triple-A game narrative evolving, what he expects from games, and how he plans
  to steer the studio to create the sort of title that will push the boundaries of
  triple-A game development in its emphasis on delivering a player-driven story.\r\nCan
  you tell me about the project, to frame the conversation?\r\nHaden Blackman: Two
  things that kept coming up that were really important to me was, one, the fact that
  we could really advance and start pushing on the player-driven story. And when I
  say that, I don't necessarily mean the narrative, although that's one component
  of it.\r\nWhat I mean is the story we tell each other about the game that we've
  played. The stories that we swap about how we've approached certain challenges in
  the game; how the world, or the characters, or the narrative might have evolved
  based on our decisions, the type of characters that we played, all those things.\r\n\r\n\"But
  for me, making the player a co-author in the experience is hugely important, and
  it's something that I wanted to explore more and more.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there are obviously
  hundreds and hundreds of ways to deliver on that. But for me, making the player
  a co-author in the experience is hugely important, and it's something that I wanted
  to explore more and more, and I think we have that opportunity here.\r\nThe second
  thing about the studio -- in conversations with 2K that I expressed that I wanted
  to do and they were supportive of -- was developing proprietary tech. Throughout
  my career, I've worked on over 20 games. Of those, I think only one was not proprietary
  tech.\r\nSo that's my background, that's my experience, that's what I love -- to
  work on games that are built on proprietary tech, because it gives us the opportunity
  to build tech specifically to deliver on the game vision, and we're not spending
  time trying to shoehorn a design into existing tech, or a vision into existing tech,
  or trying to retrofit technology that already exists to fit the vision of the game
  that we want to create. So those are kind of the big things that we're pushing on
  here: the idea that every player's story is unique, and proprietary tech.\r\n\r\nThis
  is an extremely broad question, but they're going to be a bit broad, I think, because
  we can't talk about your project in a lot of specificity. What do you think of the
  state of storytelling in triple-A games? What do you think it's doing, or could
  do?\r\nHB: I would answer this question almost the same way five years ago -- I
  think it's an incredibly vibrant and exciting time for storytelling in games. As
  long as you're looking at it not through the lens of telling a linear, cinematic
  narrative -- I think there's always going to be a place for that in games, and I
  think there will always be games that do that. But where I think things are most
  exciting are games that are, within a framework of a strong narrative -- that might
  even be linear -- creating opportunities for the player to add their own \"plot
  points,\" for lack of a better term, to that.\r\nSo I look at something like [Shadow
  of] Mordor, right? Which I think did a great job with that -- giving you a linear
  narrative, for the most part, that has a beginning, a middle, and an end, but there
  are all these opportunities within that to put your own stamp on that.\r\n\r\n\"I
  think it's a really exciting time, because people are taking those chances, and
  are taking those risks, and are trying to build more systemic storytelling into
  games.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I think that the story most people will talk about is that story
  -- the story about the orcs that they vanquished, and who rose to power, and how
  they approached certain missions, and how often they branded orcs, and all that
  kind of stuff. From that standpoint, I think it's a really exciting time, because
  people are taking those chances, and are taking those risks, and are trying to build
  more systemic storytelling into games.\r\nOn the strictly \"telling a linear narrative\"
  side, obviously as technology advances, with better facial performances, we're better
  able to tell more compelling stories in some ways, and more emotional stories, which
  I think has been great. When I look at a game like The Last of Us, which was incredibly
  emotional on a lot of different levels, and I think a lot of that was based on the
  performance of their characters.\r\nI don't think there's a better time to be developing
  games, especially if you're interested in the art of storytelling, especially because
  you have so much to work with. But again, the thing as a storyteller that's exciting
  to me, is relinquishing some of that authorship, and saying that we're going to
  author part of the story but the player's going to author part of it as well.\r\nNow,
  that's really interesting to me, because I've seen a lot of people discuss this
  topic. But one thing I don't see specifically addressed is the quite different nature
  of an authored story versus one that comes out of player actions. I think there
  are probably ways to get those close -- in terms of things like how you present
  information to the player. I was wondering what your thoughts on that are.\r\n\r\n\"The
  distinction between where the developer's narrative and their authorship begins
  and ends blurs with the players.\"\r\n\r\nHB: I honestly think that it is blurring
  -- in some of the games that are doing this well. The distinction between where
  the developer's narrative and their authorship begins and ends blurs with the players.\r\nIf
  you look at something like Dragon Age Inquisition -- yes, I can sit down, and any
  one person I talk to, we have a lot of choices that we made in common. But even
  within that, there's nuance. And especially if you've played the two previous Dragon
  Ages, and you're bringing that data over, there's going to be a lot of choices that
  make that experience your own. So I look at a company like BioWare that's already
  advancing in this direction, which is really exciting and cool.\r\nFor us, we want
  to do it in different ways than other companies out there, and we want to try and
  do it at every level. The thing we talk about a lot with the team is trying to hit
  it on every tier. I want people to be able to sit down and talk about a very specific
  piece of content in the game. Let's use, for a hypothetical, a mission, for example,
  or a quest -- to say, \"How did you approach that mission?\" and be able to swap
  stories and have every person that describes how they approached that mission describe
  it in a different way. That's the aspirational goal.\r\nAnd then you go to the minute-to-minute,
  so if that's moment-to-moment combat, it's how I approached combat? So minute-to-minute,
  hour-to-hour, and then over the course of the life of the game, all those things
  should add up to some meaningful differences in your experience -- that go beyond
  just branching stories, for example.\r\nThere are some obvious answers to this,
  but I'm curious: How is proprietary tech going to help you achieve this goal?\r\nHB:
  I think it does on every level. We need to make sure that we're investing in tools
  that our designers can use to create and iterate on content quickly. And it's not
  so much the volume, it's the quality, and making sure it's the right content for
  what we're building.\r\nMaking sure that we have the tools to build immersive worlds.
  Because if you don't believe in the world, you're not going to care about your impact
  on it, or what happens to it, or with it, over time. There's obviously investments
  we can make in A.I. to make the world more believable as well.\r\nBut I think maybe
  the area of greatest impact is in tying in game systems with game system design.
  So making sure that we are building smart under-the-hood systems that are not based
  on heavily scripted or heavily authored content, but they're more pulling on different
  components, or parts. I know I'm being very vague and general. Making sure that
  you have a lot of different levers that the player can pull, maybe even inadvertently,
  to change their experience, if that makes any sense.\r\nIt does, and it leads me
  to a question I'm very curious about. One of the impediments to player stories in
  games is that, in many popular games, the only interaction the player can have with
  the world that is meaningful and rich is through violence of some sort. How do you
  see that, and what kind of expressions can a player have in a world, to help shape
  a story?\r\n\r\n\"I think that trying to find more and more ways to interact with
  the world is a noble cause.\"\r\n\r\nHB: Again, I don't want to shy away from action,
  and I think that's always going to be a big part of gaming, and certainly for me,
  the games that I enjoy playing have a high degree of action in them. So that will
  always be part of it. I think that trying to find more and more ways to interact
  with the world is a noble cause, for lack of a better term, for game developers,
  and it's definitely something we're interested in exploring here, and we've been
  discussing it.\r\nI think there are examples out there of people who are doing it.
  But so far, we've really kind of just scratched the surface. And there are a lot
  of reasons for that. One is, there's a certain gratification that comes from playing
  action games, and I don't want to lose that -- a certain thrill from playing games
  with a high degree of action, and as I said, those are games that I enjoy playing. \r\nAnd
  also, it's just hard. It's really difficult challenge to make somebody care for
  a character that they might want to romance, for example. And some teams are doing
  that, and doing that well.\r\nI think there are a lot of other opportunities, too,
  to pull on other emotions. In the past, it's really easy to get people worked up
  and dislike a character in a game, or dislike an enemy. How do you get them to like
  a character? That's harder and people have been working on that.\r\nI think we want
  to continue to explore that, and that's certainly something we're looking at here.
  How do you get people to feel sadness? How do you get people to feel loss, in a
  game? Is that something you should pursue? We're asking those questions right now,
  because of the nature of some of the stuff we're working on.\r\n\n            \n

  2K Games announced the formation of a new internal studio, Hangar 13, lead by Haden
  Blackman -- who's well known for his work at LucasArts on The Force Unleashed, for
  which he won a Writers' Guild of America award.While Blackman was unable to talk
  specifics about the project that Hangar 13 has taken on, it's a story-driven triple-A
  game for next-gen consoles -- one that focuses on player stories as much or more
  than those created by the developers.2K's willingness to invest in a big console
  game was instrumental to his joining the company, he told Gamasutra.\"The things
  that drew me here first and foremost were 2K's library, and that 2K makes the kind
  of games I want to play,\" he says. That pairs well, he says, with the publisher's
  commitment to high-quality, triple-A games: \"It's always a conversation about the
  quality of the game here.\"This brand new interview delves into how Blackman sees
  triple-A game narrative evolving, what he expects from games, and how he plans to
  steer the studio to create the sort of title that will push the boundaries of triple-A
  game development in its emphasis on delivering a player-driven story.Can you tell
  me about the project, to frame the conversation?Haden Blackman: Two things that
  kept coming up that were really important to me was, one, the fact that we could
  really advance and start pushing on the player-driven story. And when I say that,
  I don't necessarily mean the narrative, although that's one component of it.What
  I mean is the story we tell each other about the game that we've played. The stories
  that we swap about how we've approached certain challenges in the game; how the
  world, or the characters, or the narrative might have evolved based on our decisions,
  the type of characters that we played, all those things.And there are obviously
  hundreds and hundreds of ways to deliver on that. But for me, making the player
  a co-author in the experience is hugely important, and it's something that I wanted
  to explore more and more, and I think we have that opportunity here.The second thing
  about the studio -- in conversations with 2K that I expressed that I wanted to do
  and they were supportive of -- was developing proprietary tech. Throughout my career,
  I've worked on over 20 games. Of those, I think only one was not proprietary tech.So
  that's my background, that's my experience, that's what I love -- to work on games
  that are built on proprietary tech, because it gives us the opportunity to build
  tech specifically to deliver on the game vision, and we're not spending time trying
  to shoehorn a design into existing tech, or a vision into existing tech, or trying
  to retrofit technology that already exists to fit the vision of the game that we
  want to create. So those are kind of the big things that we're pushing on here:
  the idea that every player's story is unique, and proprietary tech.This is an extremely
  broad question, but they're going to be a bit broad, I think, because we can't talk
  about your project in a lot of specificity. What do you think of the state of storytelling
  in triple-A games? What do you think it's doing, or could do?HB: I would answer
  this question almost the same way five years ago -- I think it's an incredibly vibrant
  and exciting time for storytelling in games. As long as you're looking at it not
  through the lens of telling a linear, cinematic narrative -- I think there's always
  going to be a place for that in games, and I think there will always be games that
  do that. But where I think things are most exciting are games that are, within a
  framework of a strong narrative -- that might even be linear -- creating opportunities
  for the player to add their own \"plot points,\" for lack of a better term, to that.So
  I look at something like [Shadow of] Mordor, right? Which I think did a great job
  with that -- giving you a linear narrative, for the most part, that has a beginning,
  a middle, and an end, but there are all these opportunities within that to put your
  own stamp on that.And I think that the story most people will talk about is that
  story -- the story about the orcs that they vanquished, and who rose to power, and
  how they approached certain missions, and how often they branded orcs, and all that
  kind of stuff. From that standpoint, I think it's a really exciting time, because
  people are taking those chances, and are taking those risks, and are trying to build
  more systemic storytelling into games.On the strictly \"telling a linear narrative\"
  side, obviously as technology advances, with better facial performances, we're better
  able to tell more compelling stories in some ways, and more emotional stories, which
  I think has been great. When I look at a game like The Last of Us, which was incredibly
  emotional on a lot of different levels, and I think a lot of that was based on the
  performance of their characters.I don't think there's a better time to be developing
  games, especially if you're interested in the art of storytelling, especially because
  you have so much to work with. But again, the thing as a storyteller that's exciting
  to me, is relinquishing some of that authorship, and saying that we're going to
  author part of the story but the player's going to author part of it as well.Now,
  that's really interesting to me, because I've seen a lot of people discuss this
  topic. But one thing I don't see specifically addressed is the quite different nature
  of an authored story versus one that comes out of player actions. I think there
  are probably ways to get those close -- in terms of things like how you present
  information to the player. I was wondering what your thoughts on that are.HB: I
  honestly think that it is blurring -- in some of the games that are doing this well.
  The distinction between where the developer's narrative and their authorship begins
  and ends blurs with the players.If you look at something like Dragon Age Inquisition
  -- yes, I can sit down, and any one person I talk to, we have a lot of choices that
  we made in common. But even within that, there's nuance. And especially if you've
  played the two previous Dragon Ages, and you're bringing that data over, there's
  going to be a lot of choices that make that experience your own. So I look at a
  company like BioWare that's already advancing in this direction, which is really
  exciting and cool.For us, we want to do it in different ways than other companies
  out there, and we want to try and do it at every level. The thing we talk about
  a lot with the team is trying to hit it on every tier. I want people to be able
  to sit down and talk about a very specific piece of content in the game. Let's use,
  for a hypothetical, a mission, for example, or a quest -- to say, \"How did you
  approach that mission?\" and be able to swap stories and have every person that
  describes how they approached that mission describe it in a different way. That's
  the aspirational goal.And then you go to the minute-to-minute, so if that's moment-to-moment
  combat, it's how I approached combat? So minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour, and then
  over the course of the life of the game, all those things should add up to some
  meaningful differences in your experience -- that go beyond just branching stories,
  for example.There are some obvious answers to this, but I'm curious: How is proprietary
  tech going to help you achieve this goal?HB: I think it does on every level. We
  need to make sure that we're investing in tools that our designers can use to create
  and iterate on content quickly. And it's not so much the volume, it's the quality,
  and making sure it's the right content for what we're building.Making sure that
  we have the tools to build immersive worlds. Because if you don't believe in the
  world, you're not going to care about your impact on it, or what happens to it,
  or with it, over time. There's obviously investments we can make in A.I. to make
  the world more believable as well.But I think maybe the area of greatest impact
  is in tying in game systems with game system design. So making sure that we are
  building smart under-the-hood systems that are not based on heavily scripted or
  heavily authored content, but they're more pulling on different components, or parts.
  I know I'm being very vague and general. Making sure that you have a lot of different
  levers that the player can pull, maybe even inadvertently, to change their experience,
  if that makes any sense.It does, and it leads me to a question I'm very curious
  about. One of the impediments to player stories in games is that, in many popular
  games, the only interaction the player can have with the world that is meaningful
  and rich is through violence of some sort. How do you see that, and what kind of
  expressions can a player have in a world, to help shape a story?HB: Again, I don't
  want to shy away from action, and I think that's always going to be a big part of
  gaming, and certainly for me, the games that I enjoy playing have a high degree
  of action in them. So that will always be part of it. I think that trying to find
  more and more ways to interact with the world is a noble cause, for lack of a better
  term, for game developers, and it's definitely something we're interested in exploring
  here, and we've been discussing it.I think there are examples out there of people
  who are doing it. But so far, we've really kind of just scratched the surface. And
  there are a lot of reasons for that. One is, there's a certain gratification that
  comes from playing action games, and I don't want to lose that -- a certain thrill
  from playing games with a high degree of action, and as I said, those are games
  that I enjoy playing. And also, it's just hard. It's really difficult challenge
  to make somebody care for a character that they might want to romance, for example.
  And some teams are doing that, and doing that well.I think there are a lot of other
  opportunities, too, to pull on other emotions. In the past, it's really easy to
  get people worked up and dislike a character in a game, or dislike an enemy. How
  do you get them to like a character? That's harder and people have been working
  on that.I think we want to continue to explore that, and that's certainly something
  we're looking at here. How do you get people to feel sadness? How do you get people
  to feel loss, in a game? Is that something you should pursue? We're asking those
  questions right now, because of the nature of some of the stuff we're working on."
