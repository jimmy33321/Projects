I accomplished troubleshooting my connection to Github. I had some issues with shortcuts in the emac we were using.

Some difficulty was keeping up and the volume of the AI's. I used my ears harder to overcome this difficulty.

I learned a lot, i learned many new shortcut commands in Terminal and I learned how to troubleshoot github.
