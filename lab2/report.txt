results: I managed to finish the word count program, but I wasn't able to attend lab so had some difficulties with the myprintf function.
I wasn't sure what putchar was and how to interact with it, and since it was required we use it, i was not able to finish the program.

I know that the myprintf function was supposed to teach us all about hexadecimal and the % operator and such, but I wasn't able to get to
that point because of the ambiguity on putchar. I'm assuming it takes one char of an argument..and you can use it to put it places... but i dont know if
it runs through the entire argument? Is it like a loop, looping through each character? Does it return one character at a time to somewhere?

Difficulties: understanding putchar

What did i learn: I learned a little about how to convert from hex to decimal
