It turns out the lab had an odd number of people, so i did not end up with a partner.

Results: I was able to finish the entire lab

Difficulties: Understanding exactly what Makefile was and did, I got over this by asking the AI's for explanation.

Learned: how to reference a function located in a separate file (use extern)
